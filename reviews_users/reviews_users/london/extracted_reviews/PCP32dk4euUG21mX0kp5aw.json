Never did I think before that day that a bunch of peace-loving vegetarians could effectively replicate the mood of the crowd at a Millwall - Leeds football game. I swear to Buddha, I stood there gaping back as about two dozen men, women and children lined up and down the stairwell, chanting so loudly passengers in passing taxis could probably make out the words. Even the lady behind the desk was \u00a0moshing.Anyways, after witnessing that, I knew my search for lunch had ended. I ducked into Govinda's next door and savoured their very cheap and cheerful Indian fare. They have a wide variety every day with vegetable curries, samosas and mounds of pilau rice. I believe there is some kind of all-you-can-eat deal too but I was only there during lunchtime. I would have to say that the food was the wrong side of stodgey, but for that price and with the entertainment included, I can't argue.",

It's nothing fancy, but that's not what you're looking for if you're considering dining here. There are plenty of tables, even at lunch when a bit of a queue (fast moving) forms. Most people seem to take away. The restaurant is run by and for members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (aka Hare Krishnas) - not Buddhists.

The simple wooden furniture is rustic but very neat, the crockery little more then stainless steel metal plates and cups - the two compliment each other and then with the soft murmering oriental music in the background, you feel like you are up in the Himalayas tucking into some native fare. My recommendation is the Dahl vegetable soup that tastes so damn good and doesn't leave you too out of pocket - and have a look at the shrine-like mantlepiece against the opposite wall to the entrance. A diverse and interesting eat!",

    "text": "My younger sister and I went into London as part of our Easter holiday, and- in my traditional way of getting around London in the most tourist-y and incredibly disoriented style, we got lost. But, thats half the fun! On route to finding someplace we found vaguely familiar (seeing as we only really know the museums) we grew decidedly hungry, and in a street we stumbled across Govindas Pure Vegetarian Restaurant. Great, we thought- we're vegetarians, and as a family we don't eat meat- so, we checked it out. From what we could see, the clientelle was mostly older people (bear in mind my sister and I are 13 and 17 respectively), and artistic-ly types, but the more respectable kind that wash occasionally and are less scruffy than some, but certainly not in suits! :) Well, what can I say! It was superb, for the most part. The prices were compared to a noodle place just across the way (my sister and I are huge fans of oriental foods) and we found both the prices and the food (on further inspection) to be satisfactory. The place had a good atmosphere- everyone seemed relaxed and cheerful- well, not as dour as they could be, considering the weather was bad in this is, after all, England. ;)The staff were, overall, friendly and helpful, and were accomodating to letting my sister have whatever she wanted from the foods available, instead of sticking to their pre-planned dish allocation- so the service was flexable and considerate. And finally, the food. It was rich, intense and had a very homemade genuine feel to it, like someone had put a lot of effort and care into making it. I was most impressed my the range of foods- curry, soup, different kinds of rice (we both enjoy brown but we find so few places that make brown rice available over white rice), breads- it was a wonderful selection! There are a few things though, that got on my bad side- when we picked a table at random, it wasn't clean, and in the immediate vicinity, the unoccupied tables bore dirty trays of used plates and utensils. The food was rich, intense and had a very homemade genuine feel to it, as I've already said- but everything had a strong undercurrent of peppers! I'm not a huge fan of peppers, and have been known to even avoid them if I can, so this was a minor let-down, because over that undercurrent of one of my most hated flavors, everything else was great!That said, I was impressed that I could find something my sister enjoys (she's at that age where she's going through various food dislikes, combined with some early-teen vanity over weight - like she NEEDS to worry about that!) and she's being a bit fussy over her eating habits at the moment. She heavily recommends the lentil soup she had- and it did taste marvelous! So, in conclusion, I would go again, but not with meat-eating people who I had a formal relationship with. The restaurant was far to comfortable an atmosphere to go with anyone I wouldn't take home! Good for friends, I should imagine, and definitely for picky sisters! I think I will go again, and see if a second experience changes any of the impressions I got.",

The one on Oxford Street is no different. It is pure vegetarian food - primarliy Indian, though there are bits and bobs for a more Western palate. The main thing to remember here is this isn't really a restaurant - it's a cafeteria for workers and worshippers and so ambience, service etc. are not on the menu. You sit at Formica table with other people and eat your vegetarian food in relative calm since no alcohol is served and so there is no rowdy behaviour. The food is wonderful. It is simple, tasty and tastes like homecooked Indian food - not something I have had at any other Indian restaurant. The prices are also reasonable considering it's Oxford Street. The thalis are filling and give you a taste of everything. I wasn't too impressed by the dessert section which seems to consist of wildly inventive combinations of Western and Indian desserts. But on the whole, if you want to know what regular Indians eat at home, try visiting this place. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "This is my favourite central London restaurant. This comes as a surprise to many of my friends, as I am fiercely a carnivore and never go for vegetarian options, yet this is a vegetarian, Hare Krisna restaurant. So, WTF?Well, basically, I am allergic to onions. Yes, I know it's not common, but it's the bane of my life. If I eat so much as a little onion in a curry, I will be sure to throw up. If I am unfortunate not to realise there is onion in the food, and I have not felt the need to throw up, I have been known to faint a few hours later. It's really really horrible. And debilitating.Well, guess what! Hare Krishnas don't eat onions either! Apparently it's nothing to do with an allergy for them, they think that onions will give them impure sexual thoughts (or something like that). I don't really mind why they don't eat onions, I'm just thankful they don't. Which is also why I always order the Hare Krishna option when I order food on long-haul BA flights. I must say, I get funny looks from the air hostess when she sees who has ordered it, as I don't look like the sort of person who would eat Hare Krishna food. For a start, I rarely wear anything orange unless I am going to support Valencia CF in a football match. And I would rarely be doing that on a long-haul flight, I normally use RyanAir for those trips.Anyway, back to Govindas (which is oddly a very popular name for Hare Krishna restaurants, and I have enjoyed Govindas in Dublin and in Prague, though whether they are all part of the same chain I do not know). I eat one of two things here. Either I go for the DELICIOUS lasagne (no idea what's in it, but I can't believe that food can taste this good without meat). Or I go for the all-you-can-eat Thali, which you can have refilled afterwards if you feel like a pig. That's about \u00a38 (cheaper during the day I think) and it's well worth it if you're hungry. Trust me, you won't be hungry for much longer. It's just so tasty, and it's so reassuring to know I can eat EVERYTHING and I don't need to go through the whole tedious rigmarole about onions because their religion bans it. I would even consider joining their religion if it weren't for the fact that they ban garlic also. And alcohol. So I'll just be a fairweather Hare Krishna, when in Soho, and when 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. Now, all together now:Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare HareHare Rama Hare RamaRama Rama Hare HareThere, didn't that make you feel better? Now, shut up and eat your thali.",

    "text": "First, I'd like to say that I'm not a fan of Indian food, so my review is not the most reliable to find out more about this place. You'd better trust the rest of the Qypers below/above me. I give 4 stars because I still think it's quite good value for money and a nice place to go. So, having said that, after one visit for lunch I'm kind of disappointed about this place. I tried the thali set meal with almost everything from the canteen-type food and it didn't seem really fresh... it was like the food had been there for a while. The rice was OK and so was the cabbage curry, but the salad was slightly stale. I can't help associating vegetarian food with freshness and deliciousness and healthiness... and this wasn't like that. After eating not very much I felt bloated and sick, rather than energised and in peace as I was expecting. Anyway, Govinda's was worth the visit for me just for one reason: the fresh mango juice for just \u00a31.50. I love juice and I'm not used to find such a tasty one in London for this price. I won't be going back for lunch but for sure to have juice/lassi and to try the desserts. I must add also that I loved the steel plates and cups and the staff was really nice and helpful :)",

Don't miss the samosas -- the desserts look really gross! But the rolls are yummy and the dhal is always decent! And its all prasad - which you can taste -- because it does taste like the food was made with a lot of love and devtion (on a good day)Although - if you strike up a conversation with anyone -- its likely that someone will try to krishna-fy you - this was my least favorite part of the experience (but I was still a regular). I was offered a bhagavad gita twice -- its like they spot a vegetarian and then they go in for the kill ... also ... you will leave the restaurant singing \"hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare,\" \u00a0so long as you don't break into dance I suppose you're ok -- but once the aunties left and took their sweet cooking skills with them - i stopped going back so often -- \u00a0 i think someone needs to petition them back",

Krishna accepts these offerings as devotions of love, thereby absolving the foodstuffs of any karma. Thusly, your meal is free of karma. Since the kitchen cannot taste whilst cooking, it's no surprise the resulting meal is slightly bland in flavour.Krishna has banned some items from the HK diet: mushrooms since they are a product of decaying matter; onions and garlic since they are considered \"foods of passion\". A spice known as hing is used in place of onions and garlic. Hey, at least it's something.Vegans will not have as many options, most meals contain clarified butter (ghee). I ate at Govinda's before my dairy allergy kicked in and I was grateful for a veg*n haven in a then-otherwise veg*n unfriendly area. With a lot more veg*n establishments open in Soho, Govinda's is better left for all-you-can-eat services if only for the breads.",

I believe the food is likely to be eggless as well and I mention that, because some prefer that.No alcohol here - for spiritual reasons.A great shop next door where you can buy some things from India, such as chyawanprash, which I can never find anywhere else. Chyawanprash is a sort of spicy paste, sweet and lots of cardamon etc. to ward off colds etc.I wouldn't call the restaurant cheap but I feel you get good value for money and the thali is delicious!!!!!",

    "text": "Govinda has REOPENED as of late March 2014 - after a temporary closing in February.So if Yelp tells you the restaurant has closed - Yelp is WRONG.Here is the original review I wrote in January of 2014: AMAZING INDIAN FOOD FOR PRACTICALLY FREE!London is not known for cheap food - although it exists.Some of the cheap food is of the stomach pump variety.Also - a lot of Indian food is quite mediocre - although amazing places exist. (Try going for a place that has the cuisine of one region - or to a heavy Indian neighborhood- \u00a0to avoid Anglo-Indian meh.)Govinda is neither regional nor in an Indian neighborhood but it is an 11 on a scale from 1 to 10.It is run by the Hare Krishna. (who would have thought Hare Krishna are good cooks?) I am going to guess that Hare Krishna owns the building (i.e. the restaurant does not have to pay rent) and that the restaurant is supposed to provide refection for the believers who travel some distance to worship at the temple upstairs.) Which would make the institution non-profit.Soho rents are expensive as you-know-what - so having free rent, goodwill and a very charitable orientation does AMAZING things for food prices.(Always useful in London where it practically costs two pounds a minute just to breathe air.)How is the food?a) This is a vegetarian place.b) There are a very limited number of items on the menu.c) These items will rock your socks off.Of especial note are paneer (cheese) dishes which are of absolute distinction. \u00a0Fire-y hot, with great complex taste in the sauce, and cheese with a rich fantastic comforting taste.(Mediocre commercial paneer tastes like cardboard tofu with worse texture. Good paneer is very hard to find.)A terrific thick mango yogurt dessert that is like mango lassi that found godhead just before being put onto your tray.Pappadam with a warm resonant grain-like flavor from the cooked flour itself and not artificially spiked with the spice that was dumped into the batter. Most lesser pappadams are tasteless crackers with spice camouflage. I could have eaten the pappadams alone all night and been happy.Tremendous dals and vegetable curries and an interesting peppered vegetable rice.Six zillion desserts - most Western (but homemade and vegetarian - but some Indian as well.Note that their food is unbelievably filling. I ordered the 13 pound extravaganza because I was hungry.Plus - as the Brazilians say - I am really good with a fork.Taking the standard platter that was half of the size of what I ordered would have filled me up for hours.But the food is not at all heavy - and god, is it tasty.Note that I have not seen this place reviewed in any of the Cheap Eats or published tourist restaurant ratings books - and yet to my mind, this is one of the best cheap food deals in London - and certainly one of the better Indian meals in London.This food is so good, you might even be tempted to join their religion!",

Since it was quite full of customers, we decided to try the restaurant, not knowing what type of \"Pure Vegetarian\" food it served and not knowing anything about Krisha food.We both ordered the Thali \"all you can eat,\" and I got a mango lasse (lassi). The food was plenty, especially with the free poppadoms and bread, and it was very delicious. I especially loved the potato and the soup (not sure their names). The salad's yellow dressing was a tad bitter, but it was because I honestly had no idea what the waiter was asking me. I later found out he was asking which of the two salad dressings I wanted.The mango lasse was quite good. It wasn't too sweet and tasted very natural. And the amount was enough for its cost.The waiters were very friendly and patient. The cashier smiled the entire time while my friend fumbled with his British bills and coins. The restaurant was fairly crowded with very little space between tables, but it wasn't a big deal, since the customers carried their own food from the counter. Bonus: free WiFi for customers!Overall, my friend and I greatly enjoyed our food and left with a full stomach without refilling our plates. For the price that we paid (under 11 pounds), the meal was definitely worth it.",

Was feeling a bit jaded so didn't fancy a sandwich or anything so remembered this place. It was fairly busy but I didn't have to wait too long to get served. All the food looked fresh and tasty despite being in warmers unlike the Chinese places. Decided to go for a large Dahl. Server got what I thought was a small container but he confirmed it was a 'large' and then proceeded to ladle in soup. I again questioned this and was told it was Dahl! Was give a small plastic spoon and napkin and paid the \u00a32.25. Took the food over the road to Soho Square.It was nicely hot and tasty but not overly flavourful. I have to say that this was lentil SOUP not Dahl in my view. This might be nice on a cold winters day but again just came over as expensive. I have had Thali's here and as a treat its o.k but hard not to feel aggrieved at the price once you see what you've got.Places like Chutneys on Drummond Street offer much better value.",

I would have probably given it more stars if we'd just wandered in off the street by chance. My friend has the Thali (combo plate) which was tasty, but not the best-thing-ever-make-carnivores-swear-off-meat-good. After debating the lasagna (lasagna at a Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant??) I went for a generous slice of the spinach pie. Cant really go wrong with spinach and cheese and pastry dough, but it could have been heated up more, and in hindsight I would have done without the burnt-tasting cup of coffee. Still, nice vibe, quick service, and I believe I support the Hare Krishnas (or at least I don't oppose them). Not worth a special trip, but I might come back if I'm in the neighborhood.",

After our share of sightseeing of westminster abbey, Parliament etc, we realized that Govinda's was within walking distance of the leicester square tube station. Since one of us is a vegetarian and the other craved Indian food, we decided to walk. It took us less than 10 mins to get to Govinda's in Soho.The location is very nice, close to a park. The outside looked lovely. Inside was squeaky clean. You can choose one of three thalis (difference between them being number of items) or choose a la carte. My husband chose the 5 item thali plus 2 pooris. I chose the 8 item thali plus added a roti. Total cost for both of us together was less than 20 pounds! such great value.Tables were super clean. My thali had veg balls in gravy, red beans, salad, daal soup, rice, papadam, broccoli potato sauted dry curry, a roll plus the roti that I added and paid for. All servings were super generous. I was fully satiated after eating. Everything was nicely spiced but not overly, not oily like other indian restaurants and it was obvious they were lovingly prepared and served. \u00a0I was grateful for such good food and amazed at the passion of the persons working there.My husband had similar items but less items and he said everything was delicious.Good healthy food, lovingly prepared and served; Great value; If you are a vegetarian or just like Indian food, you will like Govinda. I adored it. so happy I went there to eat.",

    "text": "I love Indian food because (1) I usually have more food options as I follow a pure vegetarian [no onion/garlic] diet \u00a0and (2) I'm in England where Indian food is said to be awesomely delicious. I had heard about this place and was in the area just in time for dinner. It was a Sunday.I had made a note that it closed at 4 pm (we arrived sometime around 5 or a little past) but forgot and despite the sign displayed that clearly stated it was closed, it was packed. I kid you not. So I was a little iffy on opening the door due to the controversial messages I was receiving (I assume the temple is on the right which was also busy), a young man heading into the temple asked me if I was there for food. I responded positively and he told me to go ahead and open the door on the left... so I did. Almost every table was full and everyone appeared to be of Indian descent other than a handful of Caucasians who appeared to be Indian-influenced by the way they dressed. The line to get food was halfway across the room and Hubby was also iffy. I was reading the menu but the food that was coming out didn't seem to be the same - it was automatic and cafeteria style on sturdy paper trays and wooden spoons. Nearly everyone got the same fare. We finally got to the front and - perhaps due to the touristic camera hung around my neck and my likely disheveled appearance - he asked if we ever had Indian food before. We found out that the food was after a service and was technically free but they asked for a donation, which we gladly gave. There were no free seats so we found a spot in a corner and ate standing up. It was really good and simple and I was glad I didn't have to worry about onion or garlic and the possibility of contamination, which is a constant worry when traveling. I hesitate to give a full 5 stars this time since the food we received wasn't the usual but if I ever find myself in London again, I would definitely visit during normal opening hours to give it a \"proper\" taste. Thank you for the food and serving it to us!",

They won't try to sell you stuff or something (other than food, of course). The prices are quite reasonable for its central location. The menu is not very easy to work out. But it looks like the main thing they are pushing for is set menu called \"thali\". Large thali plate is basically a buffet option for under 9 quid. Quality of the food is not mind blowing. But this place is still worth a visit when you are in a need of quick and decent hot food in central London within certain budget.",

    "text": "\"Pure Vegetarian\" I had the small Thali which included: salad, bread/some fried thing (which was good), a soup, a rice, and a \"main\". See my pictures!! Everything was simple and tasty. You order it up and you pay and you find a place to sit down and do your own thing. After yelping, I had no idea that the small thali was all you can eat. If i had known i would have probably gone for seconds. Nevertheless the small thali was a good portion, filling, and didn't leave you in a food coma. Both the soup and the \"main\" was light but flavorful. Next time I will go for the white rice instead of the yellow rice. The yellow rice looked old...",

I got to admit that, at first, the look of the food didn't attracted me at all, also I got a little scared but soon as I had my first bite it all changed, so many flavors and spices! The banana sauce that they have is really good, a combination of chili and sweet. It's great for vegetarians too since this little place is Hare Kristna. Don't forget to try the juices/smoothies that they have and the mango yogurt with pistachio is definitely a to go desert !",

    "text": "To sum it up, great vegetarian food that is extremely affordable. The restaurant within the name is a bit over egging it, as its more of a banqueting cafe. You go up to the counter order what sized thali you like, pay at the table and if you are lucky find a spare table and seat.Seeming that the restaurant is linked to the temple and run in conjunction with on another, you would hope that you would have a warm welcome. But the interaction with the staff was slightly cold. Maybe it was because they had a few difficult customers before me in the queue. However, if you want some cheap, tasty, vegetarian or vegan food come here straight away. (Visit - 18/07/2015 Dinner)",
