Tikka platter is a must, we took it as an appetizer to share but really was the highlight of the meal, so delicious with it's bites of Barbary Duck, Denham Estates Venison Tikka, Scotch Beef, Chicken Tikka & Salmon. As my main course I had the Beef Curry a la Dada. \u00a0My fellow dinners had a prawn dish and something else.. sorry I can't really remember but the beef curry I had was clearly the winner of the round and was simply delcious.Definitely get some naan to dip into the curry, don't let it go to waste!!!",

    "text": "I only recently tried their food for the first time, at the anniversary games we had a masala dosa. Eaten off a paper plate on a sunny day it was exceptional. I was excited to learn that they had a restaurant and it wasn't far from me. It's pleasant, the staff are lovely and attentive and the food is beautifully presented but I have a few bugbears. Firstly... if you had asked me a few hours ago, I'd have one less issue... um go easy on the spicy stuff maybe? Unless you want to feel your digestive system turn itself inside out the next day. Side note: I've grown up on Indian food. I am not uninitiated here, I know chillies bite twice. This was something else. On from the TMI.We didn't order a lot. I came here for the bhel poori. Tiny portion for over \u00a35. The crisped rice was soggy and chewy, the tamarind water added too early and allowed to soak in. It felt like this was pre-made, popped into a little mould and served up. You know how you don't season the salad until you're just about to eat it? The same thing applied here. This was not bhel poori. This was crisped rice and vermicelli (sev mamra for those desi diners) soaked in tamarind. No potatoes or chickpeas or anything so I was a little disappointed with the size and quality of this. A little bit style over substance. It looked nice I guess. The dosa was not crisp, it was small and a little bit limp. Good flavours in here though, can't help feeling like the one at the street food stall was better though! If I can recommend one thing it's that you have a strong constitution if you are going to eat the dynamite squid. It's spicy and delicious and crispy. But I'm pretty sure that it's been our undoing the next day. I would do it again, maybe get some lassi to tame the burn. Plus this portion was generous, we got gleeful and greedy. We are sorry now. So sorry. Huge praise for the staff who were friendly and professional. Upon reading my comment/suggestion card the waiter was so apologetic and insisted that if we'd said something earlier, he'd have fixed it right away. Wonderful, wonderful service! Nice little find tucked away here... not for everyone. Nice enough. What it excels in is blending traditional Brit flavours like venison etc with spices, lots of colonial influences namechecked here so that was a real break from the norm. Great for first dates, anniversaries, work dinners, that sort of thing. We didn't try anything from this part of the menu so can't comment on quality but I would hazard a guess that this is where the true wow factor is. Definitely give it a try!",

    "text": "A wonderfully authentic and genuine Indian restaurant, probably the best Indian food I've had in the UK! This was our first visit to Cafe Spice Namaste and I'm pleased to say it's unfazed by chef proprietor Cyrus Todiwala's TV fame. The restaurant was casual, staff welcoming and we immediately felt like we were regulars.The menu doesn't compare to any other \"typical Indian\" restaurant I've visited in the UK so don't expect to find generic curries. The description of the dishes ooze the character that made our visit (our wedding anniversary) so exciting. The selection of chutneys and pickles to accompany pappadums were astounding and I only wish we had bought a jar or two to take home with us. As a fan of anything excessively spiced my menu choices were predictably all \"three chilli rated\" and did not disappoint for heat levels or flavour. I went for the dynamic baby squid whilst my wife chose the lamb dosa. Whilst the squid was delicious (and quite firey!), it couldn't compare to the dosa - I would choose this time and time again. For my main I ordered Laal Masala ma Bhujaeli Murghi (I had to check the online menu for the spelling) - tender chicken with a dark, intensely spiced gravy that I could happily eat by itself with just a naan. As a guide for others, compared to other restaurant's curries I would say this equals most \"Vindaloo\" curries heat. My wife ordered a Murgh pasanda makhani and again was delicious. Much milder in heat but still flavour of spices in abundance. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to leave any room for desserts but there's always next time!",

I felt really let down \u00a0the menu gave every impression that here were people who loved food and customers but unfortunately the reality was that then food was Ok, fairly good in parts, but lacking the 'love' factor or 'wow' despite the build up in the menu and the service was poor to the point that I asked for it to be removed from the bill. Why spend all the money on good presentation and a comfortable roomy dining area and ruin it by employing a waiter so surly that he would have been better placed 30 years ago in a state run place in Moscow. I don't think I am difficult, the waiting staff last week in the Morgan Arms were fantastic and made me feel really welcome and cared for so I can't be that bad surely but I was made to feel that he was doing us a favour just by letting us eat. Perhaps he had a bad daySo, the experience spoilt and I will not be returning, such a pity.",

Good thing I was paying attention and took notes! This place is so fun and inviting. The restaurant is located in this great old building on Prescot Street. The decor is contemporary, lively and colorful. The whole place just has this great upbeat energy to it the entire time you are there. The staff is friendly and the service is very good. The food is this great eclectic mix of Indian food with a twist of other Asian cuisines, as well as a sort of European fusion. I really enjoyed all the dishes I ordered. The only issue I really had was that my chicken was a bit dry, which was surprising as it was in a sauce...hmmm. The yummy breads we ordered made up for that though ;-) They have a decent wine list as well - we found a great Shiraz on the list that paired brilliantly with our meal! This place is definitely worth checking out and is an especially fun place to go with a group of friends or family.",

If I'm going to consume that many calories in one sitting, I want to get to get as much flavor for my buck as possible.We \u00a0tried the bamboo shoot, enoki mushroom and chickpea xacutti, which had a really appealing/unpleasant flavor. Not sure how to explain it, but sort of tasted like the air of a balloon. Wouldn't recommend it. We also had the starters for 2 which was really nice. I got the sense that their meats were probably their strong suit so we missed out, and their specials did look interesting.The place: Was really big and nice inside. Not like the typical crappy Indian places nearby. Would be a good place to go with groups or work things. Very close to the City so that's good or bad depending on how you feel about these things.I think this place is nice if you need a lunch out with the suits, but the food wasn't great enough to make my regular list. The menu was much more interesting than you'd find on Brick Lane, so it's probably worth a visit.",

Superb food from across India: rich and hearty dishes from the North; subtle, tangy and lighter dishes from the South; snacks Chowpatty Beach style; Bengali and Goan fish dishes and Parsee specialities. Cyrus' Parsee heritage and Indian roots mean a commitmnent to food that respects it's origins. This is not regular 'tandoori raj', flock wallpaper muck, it is real Indian food as it is cooked and eaten in India and Indian households the world over. Each dish is not only superbly coooked and presented but the whole goes beyond mere 'show'. This is a place where everything from decor and waiting staff to drinks and, of course, the food bear the stamp of great pride, care and attention to detail. For about \u00a330 per person you can have a two course meal with a beer and feel completely content. This is a place that deserves great fame. The pity is that it is tucked away on Prescot Street (between the Square Mile and Tower Bridge) and is quiet during weekday evenings and at weekends. You'd be bonkers to miss this place.

The venison tikka aflatoon and the beef tikka kaala mirch masala were the only two that stood out, everything else was just ok (no restaurant in London can better Tayyab's at mixed grill??).

For mains we had the Murghi Ni Curry Nay Papeto, Galinha Xacutti and Masala Nu Roast Gos - all three were amazingly authentic - and I haven't seen them on any other restaurant menu in London, a good change from the Chicken Tikka Masala (not remotely Indian food) served everywhere else in blighty. Coming to desserts - somewhat disappointed, the zafrani crem\u00e9 brulee was very tasty, but the sugar did not caramelise evenly, the lagan nu custard was a ultra-tiny portion, the chocolate ice-cream tasted fab - but it obviously came out of a super-market container.I'm going back again soon, to try the balchao and the patra ni macchi :D",

Considering we had a highly spirited one year old in our group, the staff were very accommodating, attentive - nothing seemed too much trouble - to us all including my nephew, unlike other places we had experienced recently on this trip. I highly recommend the prawn Goan curry with red rice; chapattis; the classic dosas; for dessert I tried some of my group's creme brulee which had ginger and cardamon in and was truly delicious; if I'd not been so full from my main and of course a few poppadums, I'd have sampled more of it!

Came here for a small meal with some friends, ended up staggering out as there was too much nice-sounding stuff on offer...The starter sampler platter alone is a thing of beauty, 5 veg and 4 non-veg dishes to share, they were all lovely but the beetroot samosa was a real stand outWe had the mutton special for main and it was amazing but everything on the menu sounds as nice - just go trust meyou're welcome...",

    "text": "Probably one of the most flavoursome Indian Restaurants I've been to. I ended up going for the Mixed Tandoori plate to be able to try every different element on the menu. Every individual item was incredible. Three items stood out, surprisingly on this meat heavy dish the Mushroom Tikka was the clear winner, followed by the unusual Duck sausage. Even the beef was cooked to perfection, still pink on the inside but managing to hold the spiced marinade. Prices may be a little steep once you add on your side items but well worth it as a treat.

Even with such a large number of people, the servers were very attentive and the food came out in a considerably fast time under the circumstances!I ordered the spice mixed platter, letting you sample a little of each of their different dishes and almost all of them were delicious. The chilli garlic and cheese naan I had to go with it wasn't anything special, and probably too much food anyway, but the welcome I received, the hospitality of the people and the range of flavours definitely made it a 5 star evening for me",

They then accused us of not mentioning the taste card either when we booked or when we arrived... But we did mention it.Oh well, if was still nice :)",

    "text": "There are times, especially after a long week, when only a good curry will do. So Dil R and I made our way over to Caf\u00e9 Spice Namaste on the recommendation of my dad who got an email from a friend in India whose cousin was dating a girl whose roommate's brother ate at this place and liked it. Or some weirdly convoluted string like that ended up with my dad telling me to try it out and let him know. Since I'm sick of Brick Lane and couldn't enjoy a Tayyab's pork chop (no meat Fridays during Lent), I thought it was worth a shot.Walking in, we instantly though we made a terrible mistake as the place was empty except for a \u00a0table of white as snow girls. As with any food, I judge the restaurant on how many relevant ethnic people are in there. A Chinese restaurant with lots of Chinese? Win. Grabbing bulgogi from a shop where Korean is spoken far more than English? Brilliant. Getting a curry in a place devoid of brown folk? Alarm bells start going off. Still, we were here, and a dour bloke led us to a table. The menu isn't massive but each dish has a considerable amount of story and description, especially the house specialties. I settled on a traditional dosa and a vegetable thali. A quick explanation may be in order as I've found that both these dishes aren't as common here as I expected. A dosa is basically a large thin savoury crepe (something akin to a galette given its texture) with a slightly sour tinge. The outside is crispy whereas the inside is a bit more spongy to soak up curry. It's folded in half and inside is the filling which can range from spiced potatoes to a full on lamb bhuna. You eat with your hands by tearing of a bit of dosa and scooping up some filling. There is usually a couple of sauces on hand to dip into if you want more flavours.The dosa was one of best I've had in London and I would go back purely for this. Actually, I might very well do that next weekend. While not large enough to satisfy me completely as a meal in itself (in India the dosas are as large as XXXL Papa Johns pizzas), it was a substantial first course.The vegetable thali is a collection of 5 different vegetables served with a roti, pakora (deep fried veggies), and steamed rice. I also got a cheese, garlic, and chilli naan to go along with it as I do love my naan. The vegetables were interesting and included dahl, what tasted like seared beetroot (the Chef likes to take traditional british produce and put an Indian twist...to a greater or lesser degree of success), a spicy potato, a cabbage dish, and another one I forget. The roti was plain but perfect for acting as a base for the other food and the rice was really unnecessary. The naan was interesting but I think I prefer my regular garlic naan over the cheesy version.The mango lassi was perfectly thick and rich. It tasted of actual mangoes not juice or concentrate so I hope it was proper fruit being used. I'll add that to my must have again list and just get a jug instead of a glass.Overall, I liked the feel of the place. By the end it was rammed and more than half full of hyper chatty Indians (that's the atmosphere that reminds me of India). The prices weren't too bad (not Brick Lane cheap though) and I think it came to around \u00a325 each for a considerable amount of food. Plus the manager is a very friendly Indian woman who I had the hardest time not calling \"aunty\" as I was brought up to do. Good job Dad, guess I'll have to give you credit on this find.",

    "text": "My Indian friend brought us to this restaurant, saying it's a break from the usual cheap curries and take-aways found in London. The decor is a bit faded and in need of updating; the food is priced as if it's upscale dining but the decor needs to catch up. They have 4 seats at the bar for people waiting for their reservation; I had the Rose Sherbet after asking for it to be less sweet but it still came as a syrupy overly sweet concoction in which I could taste no alcohol... For starters we had the pappadums and pickles, and the Coconut & Beetroot Samosa, which is very unique and quite tasty. Then we got one of the lamb specials, which was a bit spicy for my taste, and the ostrich bhuna because we wanted to try the meat. The ostrich was well cooked and not tough at all, but it came as a thin piece about the size of pounded veal, so there was not much to go around. Both the lamb and the ostrich were small plates, which was surprising given the portions that I usually get in Indian restaurants. And definitely go for the naan- we had the saffron rice and the normal rice that comes with the mains, and they were nothing special. Highly recommend the chilli cheese and garlic naan (not very spicy at all).",

    "text": "Let me set the scene for you. My wife and I arrived in London after a long flight next to a crying baby. \u00a0Tired and hungry, we were not simply searching quality Indian cuisine, but also a pleasant atmosphere near to our hotel. CSN satisfied me in every way imaginable.  We found that the restaurant was easily accessible by subway or a quick 10 minute walk. We initially tried for the subway however the way down was blocked by an angry street performer who was groaning and cursing about the lack empathy that others feel for him. We tried to walk around him, but he tried to confront us, talking about \"rotten trust funds babies\". Scared, we decided not to take the train. Our walk to the restaurant was pleasant, and I think I may have caught a quick glance at Prince William! Now I am a straight male, but I would not hesitate to have his babies. From then on it felt like I was walking on air. Then I realized it wasn't him and I came crashing down. I was so distraught that I almost decided to go back to the hotel, but all of a sudden I smelled something amazing. I looked to my left and there it was: the restaurant that would change my life. We were seated very quickly by a spritely waiter. His name was tom I believe. He was a bright young man with a \u00a0beautiful mind for food and drink. By his recommendation we ordered Puris, Chicken tikka masala, Saag, Paneer, Indian okra, and the best damn Naan you ever had. I think of tom every now and then when I go out to eat. No waiter has ever been able to deliver food and suggestions with such energy and passion. When he served me, it didn't feel like he was simply giving me my food; rather, he was delivering me my hopes and dreams. When he served me, he made me feel like a better version of myself. At the end of the meal I had to get his phone number. He gave it to me and I think I'll call him about once a month just to check up on him. I hope for your sake that he's still there, changing people's lives with every word.Sorry if I went on too much of a tangent there, let me get back to the food. Orgasmic. That's the only word I can think of to adequately describe the food. I have never eaten such fine naan. The taste didn't stop in my mouth but it filled my whole body with pleasure. Literally. I'm a pretty \"sensitive\" guy and I dropped a piece of naan on my lap. I'll spare you the details but lets just say it ended with an embarrassing trip to the bathroom. When we finished our food, I couldn't bear it. I never wanted that night to end so I ordered more. And then some more. And even more after that. My wife and I stayed there so long that they had to kick us out. I can honestly say that I've never been so sad in my life. So we left. The walk back to the hotel was quiet. Once in the hotel we didn't mess around or anything. We just went to sleep. When I awoke, something felt different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was a sort of lightness to the air. I walked outside and I saw something flapping on the sewer cover. I picked it up and it was a \u00a3100 note. I couldn't believe my luck. An hour later, when we were doing typical touristy sight seeing things I got a call from my boss. He was retiring and he wanted me to take his place! I was elated. Money has been tight recently, and this promotion will change my life. I have no proof but this was all because of CSN. Everything about that place was beautiful. I very deeply considered staying in London just so I could eat there again. Alas I do not the means to live there. I gave my tearful good bye. I hope fate will have it that I can go back there. I pray on it every night. However, if I cannot be there, I hope you will. Have the naan for me. It will change your life. -Bobby",

I had to wait a few minutes before my hostess assigned me a table. The hostess/server has an extremely warm personality and is very friendly! I think her name is Pervin! Pervin, if you ever happen to read this review, thanks a lot for being so nice. 1 star just for you!For drinks, I tried their Salted Lassi (\u00a34.75). It was spot on. Amazing taste and for someone who loves butter milk, doesn't get any more perfect than this!For main course, they had a special menu -- can't remember if it was weekly or monthly, but it had something that caught my attention -- *Crab & Haddock Goa Curry* (\u00a316.95). The description doesn't clearly state, that the dish is accompanied with Naan. I asked Pervin if I can get a Garlic Naan instead of the plain naan, and she quickly accomodated my request at no extra charge!While I was waiting for dinner, I was also served with a small albiet delicious portion of their complementary Tomato Soup.As for the main course -- the dish was really tasty. It's basically 2 cakes of Crab & Haddock which contain eggs too. Simply delicious! I was a bit disappointed to see that they didn't have much curry sauce, but again, the attentive staff at this place noticed that and happily served me additional curry sauce (again at no extra cost).Overall, it was just a wonderful experience.Will definitely visit again and will definitely recommend this place for thier food and hospitable staff!",

I liked the crab cake, but wasn't a huge fan of the tomato sauce. \u00a0It was served with a Shrimp and Egg Salad. \u00a0Funny enough I've never been a fan of Egg Salad, but I did eat all of this!For our third dish we had a White Prawn Curry with Basmati Rice and potatoes. \u00a0The White Prawn Curry was made with ground almonds and cashews and while it is a delicate flavour, it was really lovely. \u00a0I don't know that many people touched the Butter Chicken in the end because they really enjoyed the curry. \u00a0I only had a taste of one of the potatoes (we didn't get any at our end of the table), but it was quite spicy and considering the delicate white curry, I'm quite glad that we didn't have the potatoes.Because of my lactose intolerance I was served a Citrus Sorbet for dessert while everyone else had a Rose, Saffron, and Cardamom Semolina Pudding with Kulfi. \u00a0Many of those on my tour didn't like the Semolina Pudding, but everyone enjoyed the Kulfi... they described it as tasting like a sweetened condensed milk ice cream. \u00a0They had also paired the dishes with wines from Tiki, a New Zealand vineyard, and they did a very good job. \u00a0We had a number of great meals during the study tour, but by far this was my favourite meal of the week and the ambiance of the restaurant was great as well! \u00a0I would love to go back and try some of the dishes on their usual menu.",

    "text": "We had been wanting to go to Cafe Spice Namaste for ages, having had small samples of Cyrus Todiwala's food at food festival type places but never actually having the chance to have a meal. My birthday was the occasion that finally brought us here.We were early for our reservation but were seated quickly and pleasantly. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, they sat us at a table in the middle of a row with my seat being on a bench - but oddly the table was lined up so half of me was on one cushion and half on another. We slid the table over a bit and it was more comfortable.The interior isn't huge but it doesn't feel cramped, but the tables are rather near to each other. I was surprised to be given a rather tatty menu, but I suppose they're busy and those menus get used a lot.I had pretty much decided what I was going to order before we arrived, and so we got the starter platter for 2, and I had the Murgh Passanda Makhani (a stuffed chicken breast in a sauce), and a peshwari naan. My husband had a Dhaansaak.To start with, the starters were a bit hit and miss. It came with 4 tikka meats (salmon, venison, duck, chicken), and then 5 other vegetarian items - but one of our veggie items was a meat samosa... The best thing by far was the cranberry and lime paani poori. The worst was the venison, as it was covered in a coriander-based paste, and I, alas, am one of those people who just can't stand coriander. Most of it was just fine, if a bit dry.Then the mains came, and we were so excited - and then, not. The dhaansaak wasn't to my taste as the star anise flavour was quite strong. And my lovely-sounding chicken was just meh. It needed some salt, and I also didn't like that the bone was left on the supreme. And then I decided to have some bread, but it was burnt on the bottom. I ate what I could, but no one ever came to check on us so I couldn't do anything about it. To be fair, the mains weren't to my taste and that's not their fault - but i would have liked a new naan.We both agreed that our normal Indian delivery is better, and that we're glad we tried it but we won't be returning.Our bill with service was about \u00a360. We only each had a Coke to drink, though.",

    "text": "I love celebrity chefs, and so coming to Cyrus Todiwala's main restaurant was very exciting - and possibly the reason why it didn't score all that highly as I was expecting a lot.First the positives - service was very good, some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Mr Todiwala was even there in person, and everyone made us feel at home.The downside was that I was expecting to have my mind blown with the authentic indian flavours... and I just wasn't. It wasn't a spicing problem - everything just seemed under seasoned. I enjoyed my food but I wouldn't rush back here - which is a shame because I really wanted to love it so much.",

Food: 4/5I don't even remember what we ordered but everything was delicious and perfect for sharing with a group. My only warning is that if it says the food is spicy, yes, it is indeed spicy. They do not water it down for non-Indians. Service: 4/5Our waiter was wearing a nametag that said \"John\" and it was quite amusing because he didn't really seem like a John but in either case, he was lovely and patient. Overall, the staff was attentive and did warn us that it would take 15 mins for food to be served and advised us to order some snacks while we waited. How kind! Atmosphere: 3/5It was a nice, classy restaurant. Great place for dinner and a nice ambiance. Value: 3/5The GBP to EUR conversion always throws me off, but I thought the food was an OK price. I think it might be expensive in comparison to some Indian places in Bricklane but I thought it was ok. The food was tasty and it was a nice restaurant. Great place for groups.",

    "text": "I was excited to try Indian food in London so my colleague recommended Cafe Spice Namaste.The menu is interesting. There are a lot of dishes that I just don't see in the United States. I'm guessing the American taste is quite different. I ordered the MURGH PASANDA MAKHANI dish. It was this chicken in a creamy tomato sauce. The chicken was cooked well, it was not dry at all.However, I'd have to say this was the most bland Indian dish I have ever had in my life. There was literally no flavor or salt in my dish. Even taking into account the restaurant doing a low salt initiative, I still thought the flavor was unacceptable.The other dishes didn't seem that bad though. The MUSHROOM & INDIAN WHEY CHEESE IN SPINACH was actually very good, and I don't even like mushrooms all that much. The spinach was just pureed very nicely. The TADKA DAAL had some nice caramelized onions on top.The mango lassi was okay too. The butter naan was fluffy although it lacked salt, so it definitely needs to be eaten with something else.I was very disappointed in my main dish but maybe I just got a bad dish. The other dishes were good.",

Don't even think about it, just go!What you will find is very healthy, nourishing, high quality, and imaginative food, with a focus on seasonality, organic produce and using suppliers with integrity. As a vegan I was superbly looked after. There are lots of choices, and the excellent waiter knew exactly what I was on about. I had two of the vegetable side dishes - both of them made with organic, seasonal vegetables - potatoes and English garden peas, and a mushroom and courgette Goan style curry which was done in a coconut sauce. Both delicious and perfectly sized for me instead of one main. I was really torn as they also had a very simple mushroom dish which was tempting, and there were many more I could have chosen. Unusual and wonderful to have so much choice rather than just the usual vegan option of Tarka Dal! To finish, I had the Fireside Tea - Darjeeling with dark rum, cinnamon and lemon. All perfect for a crisp autumn night. On the way out I noticed the many many awards this place has and a plaque acknowledging the chef has an OBE and an MBE. Dude deserves it - this restaurant is a true delight.",

Have been in England for over a week and was getting pretty tired of pub food, so based on reviews (good) and location (about a hundred feet from my hotel) decided to give this restaurant a go! The four of us were seated immediately (we didn't have a reservation) and offered a menu, specials, and a drink/wine list. \u00a0Was a little unsure of the Indian red, so the waiter offered to bring me a taste. \u00a0It was good, similar to a port, but quite tasty and paired well with the food. \u00a0For starters we ordered the curried Dorset snails, a beetroot samosa and Frankie lamb! All were excellent. \u00a0For our entrees we had the chicken tikka, a goat dish off the specials menu, the saut\u00e9ed spinach with mushrooms and cheese, a second chicken dish, and naan bread. \u00a0All were remarkable and distinctly different! \u00a0(I can't remember what the second chicken dish was...). We were too full for dessert but they looked wonderful!The service was efficient and friendly! Will definitely be returning on a future visit to London and plan on making the trek from Kensington!",
