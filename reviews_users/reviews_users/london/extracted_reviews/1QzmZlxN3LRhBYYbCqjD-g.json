The food was excellent The specialty of the house is a lamb dish which was so tender. I could not finish it and was flying back to NY the next day. they packed it well for me and I brought it home. My son ate it the next day and said it was some of the best Indian food he ever had.",

It was pure luck that it was located near our hotel and that there wasn't a wait for a table when we arrived! Inside was very cozy with comfortable furniture and mood lighting. The service was attentive and professional although a bit slow toward the end.After reading over their mouth-watering offerings I settled on Murgh Taka Tuk (marinated chicken with onions, tomatoes, chillies, and coriander). My vegetarian boyfriend and his vegetarian mom each ordered two half portions from the vegetarian menu. In short, it was all amazing, from the presentation right down to the food itself. I was particularly lucky because I got to sample the vegetarian dishes as well. Needless to say, we ate every last bite and were quite stuffed after. The three of us shared Falooda for dessert, but I found noodles on ice cream to be a little strange both in taste and texture.It's on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. And it is London after all! Overall, I'm really glad we got the opportunity to eat here. It is certainly one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to.",

Walking to work every day, my mother saw signs outside Zayna's door touting the awards this Pakistani restaurant had won. We were intrigued.We ordered our standard Indian food favourites: lots of naan bread, aloo ghobi, Bhindi (okra) curry, and tandoori salmon. As an experiment, we also ordered a chick pea appetizer that came with yogurt sauce and pomegranate seeds. The food was really tasty (if a touch oily), and we couldn't help but finish our meal with a bowl of temple-achingly sweet house-made ice cream. The food was delish, and the staff was really quite lovely, lighting tea lights on our table before gingerly placing our food on them. That's a nice detail I've never seen before. The staff was generally attentive and helpful, our experience only slightly mired by our server's comment to my mother as we left: \"goodbye, Lady!\" Perhaps not.",

When we got there, on time, at 8PM on a Wednesday, we were led through the vibrant, colorful dining room (which was full) and downstairs into a small, cramped room that was completely devoid of character. White tile floors, cheap tables and chairs, no ambiance whatsoever. There was only one server for several tables in this basement room, and he was enthusiastic but seemed inexperienced and overworked, so the service was spotty at best. The food was generally very good, though our server insisted we get the Mukhun Murgh (their rendition of chicken tikka masala). We did, and it was quite mediocre, easily the worst item we ordered. The Murgh Taka Tuk and the grilled paneer, on the other hand, were outstanding. We also ordered the Kastoori Tikka, Malai Boti, and Shahi Palak, all of which were very good. However, this quality of Indian food can be found in many, many lower-end places in London, at far lower cost. What makes Zayna worth paying the extra for is the elegance of the environment. If you sit upstairs, you get that. But if they take you to their basement, you are basically eating in a dive joint that has less ambiance than most hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurants in London. If you go here, be sure not to let them take you to their basement.",

Not really sure what we ordered, we just told our waiter to choose for us. \u00a03 starters, 4 mains (2 chicken 2 lamb), spinach paneer (outstanding). \u00a0Starters were Papdi Chanaa chaat- \u00a0this is so unusual and very good. \u00a0Spicy and sweet. \u00a0Samosas, and the Jumbo Prawns (lived up to their name)Mains, can't even imagine what they were, but there was not a bad one in the bunch. \u00a0All had sauces, not that it helps. \u00a0Go in and enjoy!",

And as for the food; let's just say they get it. I tried the Papdi Chanaa Chaat at the server's recommendation and you could taste each component, and the pomegranate added a lovely bit of tart, and the crisps some great texture. Had the Baati ghosht, the lamb was so moist, no fat, and the spices mixed perfectly, a little spice and nothing overwhelmed. Am heading back next time I'm in town.",

I'll blame the Churchill area for the high price. When asked for water, the only options given we're either still or sparkling. Bad on my part for assuming we'd just get tap; I got a bottle of still water. No warning that it would cost extra unless I specified tap. So one star down for that. The staff was friendly, though one in particular was \"too friendly\" to my female dining partner. Was awkward to say the least. Also a mention to any and all staff, never call a woman brassy, broad, cheeky nor hard to please. \u00a0Minus two more stars. Overall, the food alone was good and though I'm traveling the city, if I was staying longer, I doubt I'll revisit. Of you plan on going, be sure to bring your credit card, your first born to cover the bill, and removing your emotion chip to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of an overly flirty server.",

We were seated immediately and shown the menu. I opted for Ishtu (the house specialty), and my wife chose Murgh Chatkhara, accompanied by garlic naan and white basmati rice.The main dishes were all good and flavorful...the naan was just OK. While the food garnered high marks as well as the attentive service, I don't feel the value is there.

We also tried their \"Boti\" (chunks of yogurt marinated grilled chicken) which was superb.For our mains, we split an order of the Chicken Murgh Masala which consisted of chicken bathed in an outstanding creamy tomato gravy as well as the Salmon Sultani, grilled salmon cooked in an aromatic blend of crushed tomatoes, ginger and pepper.The waitstaff were friendly, polite and attentive.

    "text": "Wow! I have eaten in many Indian restos in London and in India, this is one of the best, maybe the best i have had in London. From the fresh, light, sweet mango & pomegranate salad to the tangy, perfectly spiced Baati Ghost (lamb stew) and the flavorful, again perfectly spiced Aloo Ghobi (cauliflower) and slightly crisp, but still very good garlic naan, all was presented well and, most importantly, tasted like a dream! Topped it all off with a Bread pudding thingy with cardamom vanilla ice cream. Cardamom has been my fave dessert spice for a long time and goes in my eggnog, hot chocolate, rum drinks, you name it. Zayna has made it on the go-to list for London Indian food cravings, which happens often thankfully!",

This is not a great restaurant to bring small children or babies. The kutchoomer salad is a great way to start. It is comprised of diced apples, onions, cucumbers, lemon juice and parsley. It is so refreshing. The chicken skewer is spicy but comes with a dipping sauce that calms it down. Mukhun murgh is our favorite dish that is basically cooked white meat chicken cut into chucks and simmered in a rich curry sauce. We also order garlic naan bread and pileu rice. We've tried the lamb and beef and the chicken is the best.",

I definitely felt underdressed, given most people were wearing formal shirts and pants. The owner however was very kind and let us sit down and offered us water and drinks immediately. The menu isn't overwhelming; it has just the right number of options. We ordered the Shahjahan Biryani, the Mixed Grill, Bengan Bartha (Eggplant) and a dish called Chicken Shaalimar. Each dish was between \u00a314-18 and naan and accompaniments were another \u00a35-7. Food quality was great, portion sizes were very very small for the price. This is definitely for more upscale audiences. As we were heading out, the owner, also from Pakistan and who relocated in London, struck up a conversation with my folks and we all talked for a good 25-30 minutes. It was refreshing to see just how caring and kind he was to us all.",

There is just one exception -- the basement location provides a view of the kitchen, through a large, decorative window. \u00a0We were able to watch the four chefs at their respective stations -- prepping veggies, forming kebabs from scratch, rolling bread, tending the tandoor, spicing the dishes free-hand and from memory. \u00a0We enjoyed the food all the more having watched the chefs perform their art.They can get busy, so if you're going at a popular time (like weekend dinner), it's probably a good idea to call ahead and make a reservation.",

We then asked for dessert menu again and he said that he would have to talk to the manager as that is not their practice!

Next thing you know I'm being brought downstairs in a small area of basement seating by MYSELF. I told the waiter that I didn't want to sit down there by myself and that it was weird. He said he had to ask if they can do something else and to wait there. Ummm ok.... I decided it was crazy for me to stand there and went upstairs. The original host told me \"madam I'm sorry we have nothing for you\". A few tables were empty. I couldn't even respond to that and just walked out. Mind you, I was very presentable and respectable looking. I was simply a female dining by myself. Dispicable. Michelin behavior? I don't think so.",
