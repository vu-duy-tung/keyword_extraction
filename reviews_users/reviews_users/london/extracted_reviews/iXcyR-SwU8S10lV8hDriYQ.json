    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants because of the convenient location and the speed in which they prepare take away orders. It is a very busy restaurant, but I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for my order. They prepare the best curry katsu I have ever had (prawn or chicken) and make incredible starters. Some of their more standard dishes such as chicken teriyaki or pad thai are less than exciting, but their specials are amazing. The sushi is good as well, but I almost exclusively order the curry now. The portions are a great size and the prices are reasonable. Highly recommended.",

I'm always on the lookout for places I can depend on for a satisfying quality \"fix\" and this place is perfect for a sushi craving:) The salmon sashimi was fresh, the maki rolls were tasty, and the miso was good, so tick, tick, and tick for all my sushi needs! The noodles were good too, not amazing, but a generous portion of very satisfying noodly goodness.The prices were reasonable and the place was clean. The service was fine and the food came quickly. The restaurant is hard to find but I'm so glad I know it now! I went for an early dinner with a friend, but I would recommend it for an anytime quality sushi fix. I will definitely be back next time I'm craving good sushi!",

Everyone who came after us had a few minutes' wait. The starters - veg tempura, prawn gyoza and chicken rolls - were delicious. The roast duck was the best I've ever had. The laksa and Malaysian curry both looked and smelled incredible, and judging by the noises being made from my table mates, tasted just as good. Oh and the portions were huge!",

There is usally a queue during weekday lunch but if you are coming as a couple the wait is usually shorter than that for a group. The food is a mixture of Japanese, Chinese and southeast Asian foods, such as sushi, teriyaki ricebowl, fried noodles, etc. If you are familiar with the Wagamama chain in the UK, then this is a more atmospheric, tastier, and much cheaper version. From the outside, the sign and decor give away no indication of the type of establishment and I had initially mistaken it for a gastro pub serving Asian food, so I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality and price of the food. At the entrance is a fridge with foods you can buy for takeaway. You have to go downstairs to get to the restaurant, and insdie it's not particularly big but it's buzzing with happy diners. It's well worth a visit for a quick, fairly priced, hot meal when you are passing by and feeling hungry.",

This dish was so good. I would describe it as a cross between pad thai and beef chow fun. The ingredients are similar to what you'd find in pad thai, but the taste was more savory and less tangy, like beef chow fun. I loved this dish.Overall, the prices here are very affordable for UK standards! The noodle dish was a mere six pounds for a pretty large portion, especially for the UK. I was expecting a side portion but was surprised when a plate of heaping noodles and prawns came out.Many of the other dishes looked and smelled lovely as well. I would describe the atmosphere here as trendy and busy \u00a0- it's a bit dark and sleek, and the place filled up quickly for dinner. We got to sit near the kitchen in a booth and the smells were so lovely. I would definitely come back - it's a great place to have some sashimi and a cold ice beer after a long day of work...",

I get excited every time I find places in London that do Ramen soup. I think it's huge in the states but the UK seem to be slightly more indifferent towards this stocky, noodley bowl of soupy perfection. But I digress...H&T has a contemporary, sleek feel which is buzzing without being too loud or overbearing. Definitely a good shout for busy nights of the week. It's underground (probably why it's not over-spilling with patrons) and features a descent into unknown concrete darkness on the way in but you are met with bright lights and Pan-Asian smells and friendly staff. I never feel much of an affinity for meat when I'm hanging so I went for the Tofu Salad which was actually quite tasty, well-dressed and had a nice crunch. I had a few pieces of general vegetarian maki sushi which was bouncy (a good sign of fresh rice and ingredients) rather than dry or clumpy. The Tofu and Vegetable Ramen which was restorative, filling, and downright good. Was it the best Ramen I've had? No, not by a mile. The broth base was not savory or rich enough and there was no stand-out aspect for me. But I'd have it again and have no regrets. We were pleased with their assortment of sakes and did a good job having a taste of pretty much all of them. It would have been rude not to partake in the selection... The staff gave us some good recommendations and were attentive so it was never too hard to catch an eye.",

The only thing on the ground floor is the entrance and you walk downstairs to the basement level for the main restaurant. Since it's on the basement level, that meant no cell reception or service for me. It's not bad, though I didn't really have a book with me to read so I ended up reading their table tents over and over and doing some covert people-watching. I did notice that I wasn't the only solo diner. There were a couple of other individuals enjoying their sushi as a party of 1.I ordered their chirashi dori (\u00a311.40), which came nicely arranged with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of yellowtail, ebi (shrimp), some octopus, and unagi. Very filling and it satisfied my sushi craving!",

The vibe is intimate and the food is a legit take on Asian Fusion; mostly Japanese-inspired, but definitely with a bit of Chinese and Thai in there.The starters alone are worth a trip, and there were so many I wanted to try, they're actually all I had. Don't judge. They were amazing.The Pumpkin Croquettes were a slightly sweet and crispy version of traditional croquettes, deep-fried to perfection, with a light and smooth finish. Two will set you back a mere \u00a33.10.While the spring rolls are good, I highly recommend the Vegetarian Duck Rolls, made with slightly sweet tofu skin, spring onions, cucumber, and Hoi Sin sauce. Three of those healthy rolls are a whopping \u00a34.60.Finally, the Chicken Yakitori was also a dish worth it's weight in pounds, char-grilled to perfection and doused in a sweet yakitori sauce. A few skewers costs around \u00a34.10.The rest of the menu is not only enormous, but sure to please any seafood-lover, especially sushi. They serve just about any Asian-inspired dish you can think of, including salads, ramen dishes, rice dishes, noodles of many different varieties, tempura, and sushi rolls, with a perfectly-paired sake menu to boot. But really, those side dishes are to die for.",

The side dishes were okay but unmemorable...Look, it's a decent place to get lunch, but you can do better, but on the other hand, in Blackfriars, you could do a much, much worse!",

    "text": "The Hare and Tortoise is a venue that I have often overlooked, as it doesn't look like much on the outside. A simple sign and windows covered in grey, hide behind them a downstairs area filled with delicious food smells. When you go down the place may feel a little dark due to the lack of natural light and the darker toned furniture but the minimalists in my group really liked that simple decor. To be honest I prefer Japanese restaurant with obvious Japanese vibes and slightly more traditional decor.Then it was time to try the food. Being me I could not resist the chicken katsu curry, as it's one if my favourite dishes ever, and this one certainly did not disappoint. The chicken was juicy and delicious, the curry sauce was amazing and the rice was cooked to perfection. I also tried my friend's duck and rice dish and it was also excellent. My other two friends said that their dishes were great too and we all found that the portion were massive and it was actually quite hard to finish them. I was very pleased with the food overall because it was really good, quite a lot of it and it was under \u00a38! I would certainly go back there to try more things from their menu, as they also have a great selection of sushi and sashimi and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Japanese meal around Blackfriars.",

So definitely good place for lunch. Not sure about the dinner in a very simple and no window sitting, but owrth trying anyway. And prices were acceptable too.

They churn out food and I can imagine it would be quite popular with nearby corporates but when in London for a week, I reckon you can give it a miss. Technically, the food is Japanese but they have other Asian dishes too. I ordered the laksa (perhaps that's where I went wrong...). It was passable but pretty sweet and heavy-handed on the coconut cream. Again, ok for a quick, relatively cheap corporate lunch but no wow-factor.",

    "text": "It doesn't look like much from the outside and you could easily walk past and never know it was there. I was thankfully introduced by a local to the area and my love affair with this place was born. Then menu is plentiful and the portions are generous in comparison to the price! I had beef in black bean sauce which was soft and not even slightly chewy and my other half had sushi. Both were lovely. His fish was fresh and melt in the mouth soft and easily passed the 'can I bite this in half without it exploding everywhere' sushi test.We had a selection of starters including the vegetarian duck rolls and okinimiyaki(?) sticks both were scrummy but I did think the price of the veg duck rolls was excessive. Four small rolls of classic duck pancake with tofu instead of duck for a hefty \u00a34.30 is a bit steep for what is essentially cucumber/spring onion/tofu and sauce is one of the pricier things on the menu along with a pint of kirin for \u00a35.70. Although both delicious, together they cost considerably more than either of our mains which came in at \u00a36.80/8.30. Stick to the right things on this menu and you can be full, happy and have a couple quid still in your pocket!I feel I must mention the staff who are quick and so very attentive that your plates disappear in moments once you've finished, this is not a place to linger. They are a mixture of happy, indifferent and morose but they get the job done!I've had a fair few pleasant evenings with my girls in the hairy tortoise which is what it has become to us and enjoyed all of them. If I'm in the area it's my go to place but as another reviewer said, its not somewhere to seek out in London but its perfect for locals. Even my other half was impressed on what was his first visit and mentioned what he would try on our next visit! Sorry ladies, i fear our secrets out!???",

Tofu & Vegetables Lo Mein in a Black Bean sauce - first, there were 3 enormous squares of fried tofu. I've never seen tofu that big. But the sauce was a no go. It just wasn't very tasty. It had taste, but not a great one. Ample veggies, though. But I wouldn't recommend the dish as a whole. Also, there was a piece of paper in the dish that we discovered only half way through eating it. It looked like food packaging of some kind. We immediately informed the waiter and he was nice about it, remaking our dish right away and removing it from the bill entirely. We appreciated this and from a service perspective had no issues. I would try this place again and order something different because it's otherwise a nice place, but that dish wasn't a hit.Cucumber sushi - standard, fine, no complaints. A bit on the expensive side. Most places charge between \u00a32.50 and \u00a33 for a roll and this one is \u00a33.30 for nothing special, but ah well.",

As you enter, you walk down the stairs where you reach a small and sparsely furnished dining area in full view of the sushi kitchen. The decor is modern and stylish, and the place feels quite spacious and inviting.Onto the food which is the reason we're here. Portions sizes are quite varied. The Wakame is tasty, the fried vegetables a little bland. Edamame beans hard to get wrong. Katsu curry, good portion, but again nothing special. I would highlight the pistachio ice cream dessert which was amazing and quite the surprise. Molten chocolate cake oozing with warm chocolate sauce with a nice scoop of pistachio ice cream in the middle. Superb.Service was excellent, staff were attentive and never felt overbearing as happens in some restaurants. Some dishes like the katsu curry were good value for money. Some sushi dishes were a little pricy and personal preference, not vinegary enough for me, but this is more a state of sushi in the UK, rather than a food quality issue.I'd probably try this place again simply for the divine dessert.",

They are a little chain so I'd really like to try out one or two other places to compare. They have lovely lovely Kirin lager on tap. But it's pricey for a pint. To be fair, it's the only pricey thing on the menu. Sushi - lovely. Katsu curry - bloody lovely. No duck, duck pancake roll things - also damn fine. This time there was 10 of us on a table. Mixed starters, main courses, bottles of wine, many beers and soft drinks. Many monies each you'd think? Well you would think wrong good sirs! \u00a322 each including tip. BOOM.
