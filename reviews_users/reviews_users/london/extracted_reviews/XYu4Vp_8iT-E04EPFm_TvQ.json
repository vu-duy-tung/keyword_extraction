    "text": "Lovely place to celebrate National Pie Week. \u00a0Thanks for the rec Yelp! \u00a0A friend and I piled into the cute white tile lined downstairs shop in the Market. They have a great selection of British pies and puddings. We sidled up to the counter, put in our request, learned that mashed generally comes with pie, and ordered that as well. \u00a0Service was very friendly and prompt. We did one goat cheese and squash pie and one steak and ale pie and liked them both a lot. They probably could have been a tad bit warmer and tastier, but we're in Britain, right ? ;) Overall the experience was a great one for good quality food, very reasonable prices (5 GBP per pie), and nice ambiance. Also a convenient location right in the heart of Covent Garden. Cheers!",

I'd be inclined to return for the reindeer pie or another non-Yuletide option, especially considering the prices were decent and that I'm in the Covent Garden area all the time. It's in the heart (lower ground) of Covent Garden Market. So, super convenient but a bit touristy (or at least you'll have to plow through a few of 'em on the way into the pie shop). I reckon it's worth dealing with the out of towners for some yummy pie in a central setting.",

I had the beef and onion pie because it had just come fresh out of the oven and a side of creamy mash, both with gravy. The crust was plenty flaky and very crispy. The potatoes were smooth and the gravy did not disappoint. They give you your own gravy boat so you can decide if you meal is swimming or drowning in the stuff. If you don't want to eat in, the prices drop about a pound or so and you can eat as you mill about the rest of Covent Garden.",

As a vegetarian architect, she loved both the butternut squash & goat cheese pie as well as the adorable interior design of the space. The mash and gravy were both delicious, and I will definitely be back to try the lamb & rosemary pie. Minus one star because the potato & leek soup was below average... but that's what I get for ordering anything but pie in a pie shop!",

I definitely don't think it deserves only 3 stars for the quality v. quantity v. cost.I ordered the butternut squash and goat cheese pie and it was absolutely delicious. Rich but not too greasy, flaky crust, good amount of cheese, onion, potato and squash. Both my friend and I really enjoyed the flavor, and it comes with free red wine gravy. My friend ordered the steak and cheese pie, which she said wasn't quite as good. Therefore, it's a great place for vegetarians! They also have a \"pie of the day\" which was chili \"quorne\" carne which was vegetarian and filled with fake meat, kidney beans and corn. I wanted to try it, but the butternut squash just called to me!It was only 4 pounds for takeout, and with mashed potatoes it came out to 5.15 pounds for my friend. I definitely recommend this place, and you can eat at the cute tables outside in the courtyard. Highly recommend this place for a quick, filling and reasonably priced meal in Covent Gardens!",

There isn't a ton of extra room in Covet Garden! Anyways, the menu featured a variety of savory pies, served cold or hot along with perfect mash. I loved the trendy-ness of the place, and I feel like the food actually lived up to the atmosphere. I ordered the mini or baby butternut squash and goat cheese pie with mash which was absolutely divine. The flavor combination and flaky crust were stellar and unforgettable. This was my favorite meal out of my London trip. Everything also tasted fresh and real, right down to the gravy. I wish this was a more popular food option in America! If you love in London or are visiting, please treat yourself to a hearty meal at this establishment. It will not disappoint.",

    "text": "My partner and I showed up at the Pie Shop this Saturday hoping to enjoy pie and mash, despite the tourist trap nature of the establishment (Eating at the pie shop is akin to shopping at Harrods, riding the London eye and taking a picture at Big Ben, minus any semblance of grandeur or class).When we got there, we ordered the following:1) Fish baby pie2) Chicken and Mushroom pie3) Red Onion and cheese PastieWe were very careful to ensure that all 3 pies were indeed available by pointing to them in the display counter when we ordered and confirming this with Matt (the assistant manager, who we assumed was a server)We then happily sat at our table awaiting our order when, not 5 minutes after we had ordered, Matt approached us and told us that our Fish mini pie had sold out. Surprised, we asked how that was possible as we had ordered and confirmed that the pie was available. We were told that the error was on Mat's part and he offered us a vegetarian option, which was not what we wanted. Around 2 minutes later, a female Eastern European server approached our table and apologized profusely because she gave the last Red onion pastie, the one we had ordered, to another customer who had ordered after we had. When we looked for Matt, he was in the opposite corner of the establishment, looking away. Perhaps this was because, like before, we had confirmed that the toastie was available by visually pointing it out to him. And again we were offered pie options that we did not want, mixed with apologies that felt forced and lacked any sincerity. I immediately asked for a partial refund, which was given. When I asked to speak to the manager, Mark Hudson, I was told that he was not available. When an establishment cares so little about their customer, one can't help but wonder if its design meant only to milk tourists and passers by, with no regard for its reputation and service.",

Couldn't find much kidney or steak and when I did, I thought it tasted like slightly overdone meat. I also had the cole slaw though and it was really good. It isn't a light cole slaw \u00a0as it was a bit heavy with mayo but sometimes that's exactly the type of cole slaw to hit the spot!As I said, ambience was very nice. Dim lighting with both large tables and stools for one-person diners aligning the wall. Overall good place to go for a cheap lunch and hearty meal, just don't expect gourmet pies :)",

Battersea Pie looks very pretty tucked away in the depth of Covent Garden Market. You can eat in at the cute little tables but I wanted mine to go. There are seven types of pie on offer, but I'd already decided the fate of The Winstone (Steak & Kidney). I'll admit I initially baulked at the excessive \u00a34.50 price tag, \u00a35 if you eat in. You can get sides of mash, beans, peas etc... for between \u00a32.75 to \u00a31. You can ask for herb & red wine gravy for free.So... to the pie. Just me, the pastry and the meaty goodness. For \u00a34.50 would my expectations be met. No. In fact I was gutted. This was a soft pastry pie. Where was my slight crunch as I bit through the pastry? There was none. Where were my chunks of steak & kidney? They were hard to find. I cannot tell you how bitterly disappointed I was. I have recently come across some sensational pie shops, and was eager to add Battersea Pie to this honoured list. They are by no means bad, but they fall well short of what I'd expect for a \u00a34.50 pie.",

I ate some of it anyway but being a bit squeamish about offal it did put me off - although the steak itself was tasty!",

The pies are really good, especially the steak and stout, and prices are so reasonable for being in such a touristy area. Service is quick, although the atmosphere isn't great if you can't grab one of the few tables out in the piazza. The inside is very very small and it tends to get quite crowded, so you may have to squish into the counter table on the side which isn't the most pleasant. This doesn't change my opinion at all though, and I'll definitely come back on my next trip to the area.",

Yes, it's in a prime tourist area (Covent Garden) and yes, that means the prices are slightly inflated in an already pocketbook-busting, expensive city; but the pies and pastys here are DELICIOUS!This is my go-to pie shop whenever I am in London. I love it. I dream about it. I get excited the second I step off the plane in the U.K. I love everything about this cute little pie shop -- the friendly employees, the adorable decor, and most of all the tasty, tasty pies. I've sampled almost every item on the entire menu and I've not had a dud yet. Everything has been delicious: hot with a flaky crust and freshly prepared. My favorite menu item is the (surprise!) vegetarian cheese, spinach and onion pasty. I also adore the baby fish pie. My husband gets the steak and stout pie with an extra side of gravy (which comes in an adorable baby gravy boat). Note that the dining room area is super tiny and is woefully inadequate for the restaurant. Consider yourself lucky if you are able to dine in and don't have to takeaway. If I had to create a can't-miss foodie tour of London, Battersea Pie would top my list.",

The pie had a thick crust and a delicately flavoured filling while the beans were still a bit crunchy and just lightly buttered, everything taste fantastic! We were also given a vegetarian gravy, which was also quite tasty.The staff were very nice and service was quick. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because there really isn't enough seating and the stools we sat on were quite wobbly and uncomfortable. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend this place!",

To provide comfort for the many who have to endure the endless onslaught of dark(sunless) skies and even darker clouds.Everyday seems like a great day for pie here in this frigid 10 Celsius weather in days of early June; \"summer is here at last!!\" or so that's how they've labelled it.This pie is warm but no quite warm enough. The crust is flaky but only to be upset by the chewy under-cooked inner half of the crust. That filling is mundane and unimaginative at best. Chicken is stringy if not rather tasteless at the same time. But that gravy in the filling is almost gold; salty and sweet with the perfect slightly gelatinous consistency.Far from the best pie I have had in my time but I would say it's one up your local supermarket pie.",

I tend to hate touristy places, especially when they're really crowded, but there's something about Covent Garden I simply can't resist.As for most heavily touristy places, food is still a bit meh around there though. And/Or rather expensive. But, as for any general rules, there are always exception and I think I've found Covent Garden's!Battersea Pie's shop is a tiny unassuming shop located on the lower level of Covent Garden's Plaza. And it's most definitely the best value-for-money meal around!The whole place is pretty simple. It's all white tiles, marble-like tables and wooden stools. Plus all the necessary condiments. Which is perfectly fine by me (for some reason, I rather like this no-fuss look).But what I like even more are the pies, that are really quickly brought to your table by one of the lovely, always smilling members of staff. From then on, it becomes really difficult to resist the urge to dive in. Don't even try, just gave in to buttery, flaky pastry encasing the most moreish mince beef and onion filling. Hot, salty and very satisfying, there isn't much more to ask from a pie, is there?",

We had the above mentioned pies and it was delish. As a side we had rocket salad aka arugula salad, light and refreshing.Would definitely recommend",

We were told they would open in 10 minuets so we waited. About 12:18 they finally opened without apology.  \u00a0 The beef and stout pie had a cardboard rigid crust. The filling to their credit was large pieces of beef but only filling about a third of the pie. The filling has no seasoning. It took salt, pepper and gravy to make it enjoyable. The minty peas were hard and nearly warm without any minty flavor or scent. All in all, far from bad but very short of good or worth a return visit.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved this place. My boyfriend came here 2 years ago so when we passed through Covent Garden last week he said we HAD to stop because they were the best meat pies he'd ever had. \u00a0Well... we ended up going twice! I was also in London a few years ago and learned the hard way that my mushroom allergy & meat pies don't mix (my face looked like a fireball). Alas, when I walked in to Battersea Pie & asked if they were all made with mushrooms, only the specified Chicken & Mushroom was and they assured me I was safe to eat anything else. I had the Steak & Stout pie, while Michael had the Minced Beef & Onion. They were so incredibly delicious. \u00a0The crust is so perfect and the flavors just unfold into your mouth. \u00a0I loved it. The second visit we had on this trip was on our last day. \u00a0We had a late afternoon flight and came here for a quick bite before the airport. \u00a0When we came in a few days earlier I noticed a Butternut Squash & Goat Cheese pie that I was going to order to avoid mushrooms. \u00a0It had been on my mind so I ordered that and Michael got the special \"Ginger Pig\" Bangers & Mash. \u00a0Obviously much different orders and we did both wish we had reordered the same from the other day, but the food was still delicious. \u00a0My pie tasted like Thanksgiving. \u00a0It was a little different than I expected. \u00a0It had chunked squash & onions but was very good. \u00a0Michael's special was also delicious, the potatoes were great and adding a little of that Colman's Mustard is the perfect touch. \u00a0Will definitely go back next time we are in town.",

We tried the steak and stout pie with mash. Filling was very flavorful, \u00a0with large chunks of tender steak in a stout gravy studded with sweet onion. The puff pastry was done perfectly -- not heavy at all. Mashed potatoes were buttery, smooth, and moist. The mini butternut squash and goat cheese pie surprised us with how well-balanced it was. We had expected the goat cheese to overpower the delicate squash, but the squash held its own and lent a delicious earthy sweetness to the savoury filling.

With plenty of choices, it would be hard not to find your true calling. Whichever you choose, the pie is truly filled with a generous amount of meat and - I pray you - do not expect this to be merely a snack because it could fill you up as a meal!Anyway, if you are around Covent Garden, definitely go downstairs and pick up a meat pie to eat!
