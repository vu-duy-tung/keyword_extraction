    "text": "After Tommi's Burger Joint closed its temporary shop a few months ago, the reopening in August 2013 at a permanent site nearby was awaited by many fans, including me. Finally, they opened just a few doors down of their first location and occupy a much bigger space to seat more burger lovers. I went to the new Tommi's Burger Joint branch last week to celebrate the booking of my upcoming Iceland holiday \u00a0as Tommi's Burger Joint is the UK outpost of an Icelandic business. Basically, not much changed \u00a0and that is good news. Because it was already a great place. As I wrote when I reviewed the initial branch, Tommi's Burger Joint is not a fancy burger restaurant, but a plain and down-to-earth burger joint that offers simple and simply tasty burgers for a reasonable price. When I went this time, there was a again mixed crowd as usual. With reference to Patty & Bun just a few meters away, be prepared to wait a few minutes here as well \u00a0but at least most likely you will not need to queue outside My burger was nicely cooked, somewhat juicy and easy to eat without causing a big mess. The bun coped well with the patty \u00a0probably because the burger is not too big. It was definitely big enough for me anyway. The fries do the job, taste good but are nothing to be excited about. I will soon be back at Tommi's Burger Joint for another Icelandic treat.",

    "text": "Tommi's Burger Joint is a busy no extras kind of place. Situated in the lively and fun Marylebone area it is a short walk from fun bars, shopping, and other burger joints. I went to Tommi's with a number of other bloggers from the London scene to taste their burgers. I asked for the best burger that they make and the recommendation was the Steakburger with cheese, bacon, and b\u00e9arnaise sauce. Other toppings on the burger included tomato, lettuce, and chopped onion. Upon my first bite I'll have to say that the b\u00e9arnaise and steak are what make this burger. My next few bites highlighted the bacon which was pre-cooked, and waiting in a bin. Ultimately, this bacon was not to my liking as it was too crispy and borderline burnt. I pulled out some bacon and focused on the hollandaise, cheese, and b\u00e9arnaise. My impressions were that this burger was quite good... really good. The soft bun, and creamy & rich b\u00e9arnaise made this burger. You could almost eat this burger without the beef; since the veggies, cheese, and b\u00e9arnaise were so flavorful. The tomato is a bit confused on this burger and it would probably be better off without it. The beef is semi-juicy with a loose pack and a good flame grilled char. Overall, this burger has some great elements but it also has a few misses like the bacon and tomato. I ordered the best they have and they served me up a few misses. If you go to Tommi's ditch the bacon and tomato and you'll definitely have one of the best burgers in London.",

    "text": "Re-opened as a permanent business, I visited on soft launch night (5th August) to give this place a whirl after reading rave reviews about their pop-up. Menu is very straightforward: 4 choices of burger (regular, cheese, veggie or steak), fries and 4 flavours of milkshake (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla or coffee). Everything is made to order, so after you queue up to place your food request you find a place to seat yourself while the staff weave their magic and present the results to you when completed. There is no formal seating arrangement, so all chairs and stools are snatched up on a first-come first-serve basis. Prices seem pretty reasonable - at \u00a35.90 for the regular, it's cheaper than most other gourmet burger vendors like Byron, GBK, Honest or 5 Guys. Tommi's seemed to be well staffed and the food was generated in brisk time - I received my milkshake within 5 minutes of placing my order and the burger appeared about 5-10 minutes afterwards. The shakes are purportedly made from Icelandic ice-cream - don't know what that entails, but mine was pretty scrummy. The steakburger was melt-in-your-mouth gorgeous - even the addition of lettuce seemed to enhance it. A nice touch was the ability to serve yourself condiments (relish, pickles, mustard etc) \u00a0from a tray on the serving counter.Overall an excellent burger vendor.",

    "text": "So after reading brilliant reviews of Tommi's on here, I decided that I needed to branch out from my usual burger fix and go here... which turned out to be a horrible decision and a huge regret! The burgers were so distasteful, mainly because the meat tasted like it was processed and similar to something you'd get in a school cafeteria- it was horrible. I couldn't even really finish my burger as the meat just had a gross taste to it. The chips were okay, nothing special. However, the only thing that saved Tommi's was their shakes! They do proper thick American shakes and to be quite honest, might just be the best shake I've found in London. So in conclusion... definitely NEVER coming back here for a burger (as I'd rather go hungry than have to eat a burger from here again) but I will definitely be back for a shake!",

They offer a selection of sauces that you grab yourselves including a house jar of pickles and jalapenos. Sliced for easier eating too.

    "text": "Tommi's is a real tiny burger joint with Icelandic roots, in fashionable Marylebone. The place only has seating for around 30 people, meaning at meal times, it's quite difficult to get a seat, let alone a standing table. The interior is generally nice, think wooden hipster shack. Upon arriving, I'd already memorised the menu and it was clear there would only be a choice between beef and a single choice of veggie burger. As a non-beed eater, I was okay with this, and ordered the Veggie Burger, with a portion of fries, some of the well reviewed Bernaise sauce and the Icelandic ice cream strawberry milkshake.The milkshake is immense. My fave part of the meal. It comes supplied with a straw, but forget that, throw it out and pick up a spoon from the condiments area. That's how you're going to drink the super thick shake. Whilst I ordered strawberry, there were ony hints of it, leaving me to assume the vanilla ice cream that made up the majority of the shake simply overpowered the small quantity of strawberry extract/sauce added. It was delicious nonetheless. The veggie burger was good, but less impressive. It's a veggie burger, that didn't taste like it was from the freezer (even tho it probably was), only because of the charred method of cooking. The fries too, were nothing special and actually quite pricey for pretty much frozen fries. The Bernaise sauce, excellent, but a little wasted on chips. I slathered some into my burger and that improved things.In all, the place is definitely overhyped...The veggie burger was not great, nor did the beef ones look much better. The milkshake was good, but doesn't make up for the main attraction (the burgers). To top it off, it was pretty pricey at around \u00a314+ for the lot. Especially since I wasn't seated either. Like others say, it's worth an initial try, but I probably won't be back, after all, there's only one item I can really eat here and plenty more burger places in London!",

    "text": "So I'm absolutely kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Tommi's has been on my radar since they were a pop-up, but living in the suburbs, I knew I'd have to make a special trip (and never made it). I even told my Icelandic friend about the place, and she raved about it, but yet I didn't make it out. Until last night. After a night of drinking in Westminster, we were figuring out dinner, and since my Icelandic friend was there, I suggested Tommi's, and she was totally on board.As I had never been, I wanted to try everything! Originally I was drawn to the \u00a310 deal: A burger, fries and a can of soda. It's a pretty good deal for a burger place like this I'd have to say. However, once I saw the milkshakes on the menu (made from Icelandic ice cream!), I knew that my order would be different. I also was HUNGRY so I opted for the double burger with cheese and bacon. The other half got the steak burger (alas they were out of Bearnaise sauce), and we split an order of fries and a vanilla milkshake. Add in some water and a bottle of beer, and we were good to go!The place was packed at about 8:30 on a Wednesday night, but by 9:30 it had emptied out, so if you don't like queues, come late! There's a surprising amount of seating in the place as well, and even though there was a fair number of us, most of us found seating by the time our burgers came out (as the previous people left before our orders were ready). There's also a few movie posters floating around on the walls, but the one that I appreciated the most was the poster for \"Dancer in the Dark\" (starring Bjork!) on the wall while heading downstairs to the toilets.So the milkshake came out first. And it was amazing. The vanilla was super tasty and the shake was really thick and creamy. Totally recommend one! The burgers and fries were next. We decided to split, so I ate half of my double burger. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy and it just melted in the mouth. The steak burger was really good as well (and also perfectly cooked), but after having such a mouthful of meat (yeah I went there) with the double burger, I wasn't as impressed. The other half preferred the steak. So much so that he decided we needed another steak burger and another order of fries! The fries are nicely crisp and hot, but not as interesting as some of the chips at other burger places (but who cares really?) After the second burger, I conceded that the steak is indeed better.So this may possibly be my favorite burger place in London so far (although I know I have more to go). The burgers are perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious. It can be reasonably priced (\u00a310 special!) or you can go crazy and spend a good amount of money (a double steak burger with Bearnaise and cheese will run you around \u00a315 just for the burger) so it's a good place for when you're out with people who are on a budget and you want something a bit nicer. I've always been told that Iceland is the place for hot dogs, but apparently they can pull off a fantastic burger as well!",

Maybe not one of those \"best I ever had\" burgers, but you just can't fault it. Although not many sides, the chips are good and they have a great selection of beers. They even had Icelandic X-mas beer!The piece de resistance, the sauces mentioned by other posters, are also great. Anything you want, get it from the counter.",

Our group of 5 got lucky... we arrived and there was a minimal queue and by the time our orders were fulfilled we got a table for all of us. Score! Good burger karma or something.I had a cheese burger with fries and a soft drink (aka the offer of the century) and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the steak burger and raves about it... says it's the best he's ever had (...Shake Shack included), take it or leave it. I tried some of his strawberry milkshake - so thick, it's like ice cream (almost) but pure and delicious. If you can fit it in along with your burger & fries, go for it.All in all, a great experience. Definitely one of the top burger destinations in London these days.",

The fries were also really, really good.Loved the run down (but very clean!) feel of the place and the sauce selection was pretty darn good too. Being a big burger fan, I am used to going to a lot of American style places... I therefore was pleasantly surprised that they had English Mustard (which is actually a rarity in some burger bars). All together a decadent and calorie fueled luncheon was enjoyed - would love to go back and see what it's like in the evening too!",

    "text": "It makes me sad that I have to write this review; if I had reviewed it last year, the Tommi's pop up Joint would have gotten an instant 5 stars. I travelled quite a long way to get to the new Marylebone site, and maybe it was the sky-high expectations set by Tommi's previous incarnation, but I was left a little disappointed. The menu is still the no nonsense I'll-have-this-this-and-this affair, which is good for people like me who have serious anxiety issues over making any form of choice. Cheese burger, vanilla shake, fries, boom. Simple. With such a pared down selection, each element needs to be pretty great, but this time around, none of them were quite there. The fries were a little underdone for my liking, and the milkshake was good, rich and thick, but nothing to ride home about. The burger was pretty delicious until the centre where there was an overwhelming burst of mustard. I know on the menu it does say all burgers come with mustard but this was overpowering and dominated what would have been a really great burger. The new location is definitely a lot more practical. You can actually find a place to sit (and breath). That being said I quite enjoyed the scuzziness of the old location, the hustling for seats, the sharing of tables, the crammed cabin-like feel. Maybe the discomfort was all part of the appeal - it set it apart and I remember it as an event culminating in the best burger I've ever had. Now it's surrounded by hoighty-toighty boutiques and expensive handbags, and it doesn't quite feel right. I will probably come back, the memories of that illusive heralded burger still causing my heart to beat a little faster. I hope they can hit that mark again.",

The meat was tender, sauces nicely balanced and I could actually taste the lettuce and tomatoes.We sat by the window on bar chairs byt the door. It was.

It is hard to get a seat at lunch time,yes, but the burgers are immense and well worth the relative hassle. If you don't want to be involved in the rush quite so much, come a little later, after 1pm, and you should be fine.Something I haven't tried yet as they are new additions for this new venue, is the milkshakes. They look incredible though, so it won't be long until I dive in.Another thing that has changed is that it is no longer a BYOB, they actually sell beer on site, which is fantastic when you sneak out for a cheeky Friday afternoon burger and beer.Welcome back Tommi, I missed you.",

Deep beating Hiphop of Outkast's 'So Fresh and so Clean' was rocking the joint at lunchtime making us throw a few shapes while waiting in line for our order of Steak burgers!What came were some of the most succulent juicy burgers that I've ever put into my mouth - and this is saying something as my Dads nickname for me as a kid was 'the Burgermeister' The fries were crispy and just what you'd expect from this place - their condiments selection was also off the chart and greatly appreciated by myself and my European chums. I think Tommi's is the sort of place you could go if you wanted a lunch time meal, a quick evening dining experience or maybe something to take away - pretty well priced at around \u00a37-9 a burger - not to be missed if you're in London (or even travelling from afar)",

    "text": "Over-hyped: Tommi's gets one star for not giving me food poisoning and another for its decor reminiscent of up and coming burger joints in NYC where the atmosphere is fun, relaxed and even inviting.The main event, however, was entirely disappointing: a medium cooked cheeseburger really lacked tenderness or any unique flavour. They were stingy on the lettuce and onions and the sauce was nothing to rave about (a mix of ketchup and mustard). It revels in its simplicity as apart from bacon, there are no other customisable toppings. It was probably the most average burger I've had in a while. Whilst chewing, I had a fleeting thought that even McDonald's could throw together a tastier one ...and I don't particularly like theirs!For me, if a burger joint can't deliver on its main premise, it has to be avoided, no matter how inviting the decor is. Give this a miss.",

As always, it's pretty easy for me: pick a couple of friends who already live there and are so lazy they are not moving out of W1, and go!And... I was disappointed. A lot.The place is nice, with the boards, the red phone (damn, I need to buy a red phone, then I can alternate between boston accent and russian accent, that would make me laugh for at least a couple of years), the waitress and the open-plan kitchen (I don't know whether this is correct word, anyway a kitchen customer can see!).The problem is actually the food: I can't get why grant and Hannah loved it so much, maybe the place changed its burger dealer or something because the food was really not that good.First, the burger: I love a nice chopped burger, that was almost pureed meat, which is bad, really bad. It was more on the dog food range rather than the human delicious burgers. Fries are just meh: crisp and hot of course, but very tiny, and that makes them basically flavorless, and very, very salty. it's just like licking a salt pillar, somebody likes it, me not. And it was not a mistake, as we ordered two portions in different times in order to understand whether it was just an error followed by lazyness or not. But they have Bearnaise sauce. Acid bearnaise sauce. bahStill have to try the milkshake, but I really don't want to enter in this place any more so..... I'm probably just avoiding the place!Moral of our story: went out of this place, reached tommy and bun just 200 metres after and had our proper, damn good burger.",

I have been here four times so far and have enjoyed every time, but have been hoping for an improvement in the burgers each time. What I like the most about the place is the fact that they offer a range of condiments for free, which is a nice touch to go on your clean cut fries. The place can get busy, so expect to wait a bit for a seat if you aren't lucky. Worth a visit, but nothing overly special (good if patty and bun down the road has an hour queue!)",

So after a fab yelp event, Alex S, Jane G, Ray C, Becky H and myself (among others) trotted over to Tommy's. This was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise slightly overly pretentious part of London. Cool, quirky, laid-back and good burgers. Stools were uncomfy but there was free coffee! Good price for a cheeseburger with bacon (\u00a37), the menu was written on haphazard bits of cardboard - I like that, bit of kookiness. Good burger with nicely toasted bun, only 3 stars cos in London you can find better at Grill Shack or Shake Shack. Normally I would love this place, but too much good competition. Shame",

    "text": "This place reminds me of \"Burger Joint\" hidden behind a heavy velvet curtain in the glossy lobby of Le Parker Meridien in midtown Manhattan. Likely that is also where the name comes from, or maybe I'm giving New York too much credit. Then again, the name. And the fact that it purports to be a greasy dive in a rather fancy neighborhood.The burgers are upgraded junk food; McDonald's 2.0. Good ingredients masquerading in paper wrappers and the kind of shiny flimsy bun that smushes so well into a burger patty. That makes it a fun experience - stand in line, order at the front where the menu is just randomly written on pieces of paper pinned above the cashier. Same theme with the milkshake which I got to try a little sample of (extras from the blender! right time, right place)... made with really thick amazing Icelandic ice cream, I almost bought one on the spot until I remembered that I was already going for the fries (if I were to do it again I'd choose the former... undersalted and underwhelming). Next to the grill they have a whole tray of random sauces ranging from Lea and Perrins to Heinz to Sriracha and a bunch of ruffle-cut pickles and sweet caramelized onions. Nice touch, but also somewhat necessary -- I felt like I had to accessorize a lot with these things to make the flavor of the burger worth it.",

    "text": "The London fast casual burger scene is one that is evolving for the better, so my expectations were high when I stumbled across the very positively rated Tommi's Burger Joint. While it was good, I wouldn't classify it as anything better than A-OK.Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Atmosphere is where Tommi's really shines. While you're smack dab in the middle of a pretty well off part of London, you'd honestly think you were in a trendy dive in the East Village. While I'll admit that the ~20 minutes that I waited for my Steak Burger was a bit much, but friendly service offset that. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?For London proper, my acceptable range for a burger that doesn't come from a chain is somewhere below \u00a310. At \u00a38.90, my steak burger from Tommi's was within this range, and while this was by nearly every definition a 'small' burger, it just squeaks by in the value category, especially when the standard burger is priced more along the lines of \u00a36. Have a look:yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?A good burger? Yes. The bun was fluffy and buttery in a day and age when burger buns have been neglected, and the cheese and lettuce were fair enough, although nothing special. Now, my burger was defined as a \"steak burger\", and while I'm not sure what that means, the patty here didn't taste any different from a regular burger. On top of that, there honestly wasn't a whole lot of flavor here, which was disappointing. I'd have loved some additional flavor in the patty, or some spice, but it seems as though Tommi's places a large emphasis on the topping that you can add yourself as opposed to the default flavor of the burger. I'm not a huge fan of that approach, but to each their own. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?The fast casual burger scene in London is so competitive that I simply can't recommend Tommi's incrementally over some of the alternatives in the area. No Star Granted.",

    "text": "Tommi's Burger Joint. Difficult, very difficult. I don't even know where to begin. Just too much yum to handle.This burger joint is very very very popular amongst the kids at my university. And I can understand why, the student night option is great and saves you money on beer.But the burgers. O' the burgers. They are cooked to perfection and you can build them any which way you want. The burger is smaller than what you'd expect if you compare it to other burger places in London. But for what it lacks in size, it makes up for in taste.I usually go for the single with bacon and cheese with fries. I always add some hot sauce goodness and BBQ deliciousness at their sauce counter, which is always STOCKED UP. They have other options, however I haven't tried any of them yet. The steak burger sounds amazing, while the double patty burger looks a bit too filling in my opinion, BUT HEY, that's just me.The one thing that's annoying is the place is pretty tiny. Even though they have seats outside, we all know what london's weather is like. But other than that, this place is amazing.",

    "text": "After meaning to go there ever since I read it was a favourite of the beckhams, today was finally the day! Not really being a big meat eater, the options were limited to either a veggie burger or the burger of he month - chargrilled chicken with avocado. After a careful deliberation, the mention of avocado swayed me for the chicken. At almost 9 pound it was on par with prices at other decent burger chains - meat liquor, patty & bun and honest, so couldn't quibble. The burger was delicious, the chicken was chargrilled to perfection and the salad and avocado complete a really lovely burger. I didn't try the fries as I'm not a massive fan of thin shoestring fries. If you're in the area, definitely call in for a burger and I'm told they have a special offer for students on a Monday.. Another plus point.",

    "text": "This was the final stop, #3, in our London hipster burger tour. \u00a0Tommi's was definitely as solid as Patty & Bun and Honest, but not strong enough to take the lead definitively from P&B. \u00a0They have a super simple menu which reduces decision anxiety, that was a plus. \u00a0Well, at least until you get to the fixin's area, definitely some decision anxiety there. From their menu, you have the choice of a burger, veggie burger, or steak burger. \u00a0That's it. \u00a0You can get cheese, bacon, and b\u00e9arnaise or cocktail sauce as optional toppings before you get your burger. \u00a0Easy, right? \u00a0Well, yes, until you get to the aforementioned (free) fixin's bar. \u00a0There you will find pickles, jalape\u00f1os, caramelized onions, horseradish and dozens of bottled sauces from Sriracha to A-1 steak sauce. \u00a0Lots of choices, looked like a Bloody Mary bar. \u00a0I chose a few jalape\u00f1os for my burger.The burger was very good but it was no P&B \u00a0invention; just a very well-rounded burger. \u00a0My wife's veggie burger was made of encrusted black beans and she said it was the best burger of that variety she's had. \u00a0Chips were standard, like Burger King fries to be honest. \u00a0Overall, recommended. I think it's a toss-up between Honest and Tommi's for #2.",

    "text": "OK, I must confess it took me quite a while to find the street this venue is at. I am not very good with directions. But when I finally found it and walked through the doors the huge queue did not scare me. A bunch of my friends kept saying: \"this is the best burger in town, you must have it\", and I was determined to try it, no matter what. The queue was big but it didn't take a lot of time to get my order, I think the biggest problem is finding a table, if you didn't save one before ordering. But let's talk about food! The burgers are indeed delicious, juicy and yummy. Basically you choose if you want a regular burger, a cheeseburger or a steak burger and add some toppings (like bacon or sauces) you might want with it. Are you a vegetarian? No problem, they have veggie option. Also, they are pretty flexible in changing the order or the ingredients inside the burger (which you may know is not very common in London), so if you want something different or want your burger cooked another way they encourage you to let them know, so your experience will be even better. Come and try, you will not regret it.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed all of the burgers within the burger triangle of Marylebone. \u00a0Even though Patty and Bun and Meatliquor have delicious burgers, Tommi's is my favourite. \u00a0The menu is simple, the process is easy to get a burger by ordering at the counter, the music is fun, and the burger and fries are just damn good. \u00a0There's nothing fancy about the burger and fries. \u00a0No secret sauce or added items. \u00a0They're simple and original - just the way a burger and fries should be. \u00a0I usually order the \"Offer of the Century\" which includes burger, fries and a soft drink for 9.90 GBP which is a great deal for London.Another thing I love about Tommi's is that it's self serve with all of the awesome extras. \u00a0They have pickles, jalape\u00f1os, mayo, mustards, ketchups, all kinds of hot sauces including sriracha and steak sauce. You name it - they have it. \u00a0This way you can make your burger to your liking.Keep in mind that it can get pretty busy at peak times for lunch and dinner so go early if you want to sit and enjoy your burger.Would I go back? \u00a0Hells YES! \u00a0It's on the favorites list.",

    "text": "It is not very often that I queue for food, especially at lunch time. \u00a0But, having decided to come here, queue we did. \u00a0It wasn't too bad a queue time and it gave you some time to review and think about what delight you might order.Burger (with cheese and bacon) and fries (with a free drink) came to around \u00a311. \u00a0This is typically more than I would usually spend on my lunch but given the reviews, was hopeful that it would be worth it. As you queue, if you want to eat in, there is the slight worry that you might not get a seat. \u00a0Inside was full but, as we stood queuing you realise that there is a reasonable turn over of tables and the diners do not usually stick around chatting too much once finished. \u00a0The speed in which they clear your basket possibly helps this as you don't want to be seen to be sitting at an empty table just chatting whilst diners queue for a a table.You order, grab a table and wait for your food. \u00a0Your name is called and you flag to say that it is yours and then your basket is brought to you. \u00a0I have to say, the basket of food was delicious. \u00a0Biting through the soft bun into a juicy burger was delightful. \u00a0The basket held a pile of chips. \u00a0Lots of chips. \u00a0This meal is one of those that you think 'never going to eat all of that' but, also the type of meal that you think 'that bite was lovely, I am going to chew slowly so I can savour the taste' whilst, at the same time thinking 'let's chew quickly so I can take another bite'! \u00a0Before you know it, the burger is gone.The chips are just as nice, they are good chips and what a pile. \u00a0Never going to eat all of that and at lunch time.......oh..... I ate them all!! \u00a0Gone. \u00a0I cleared that basket of food in record time.Just as well there is a little walk back to the office......",

    "text": "Tommi's Burger Joint is back...and I have to say me like it! I'm generally not the one who's always floating on the wave of the hip places, but given that this joint is in a rather unhip neighbourhood - aka corporately boring Marylebone - I am actually quite happy about this addition.I've been to Tommi's for lunch yesterday; I got there right around noon and that was a good thing as the lunch crowd started to pour in just after me. I ordered the \"Deal of the Century\", which includes a burger, fries and a drink. Although they have a couple of sauces on sale, I don't think they're necessary as they also offer a wide variety of free condiments, such as various ketchups, mayos, chilli sauce & my absolute favourite...the caramalised onion. (They are that good and I wouldn't be surprised if they started charging for them soon.)Like I said, I like Tommi's Burger Joint - especially for the fact that it's dared to come to a rather bland location. I just hope that they won't get this silly idea to expand their emporium in a Byron style fashion...as soon as I see another Burger Joint popping up, they will have lost me as a costumer. I plea you: stay unique!",

    "text": "What a great little burger joint!I'd like to give these guys 3.5 stars, I think 3 is too low, however, they're not the best in London, and a 4 is a bit to high when you compare to these!Recommended first by Yelp friends and then by some friends who are local to the area, you have to wonder what all the hype is about.If you know me I'm a great lover of burgers that aren't overcooked and these don't fail to disappoint, so if you order it rare, it'll come rare! Tommi's gets a few bonus points for that straight up.Tasty burgers, with a whole host of pickles, sauces, condiments and accompaniments that'll allow you to tailor your patty to exact personal preferences.Try the steak burger, it simply melts!I love the idea of free coffee to, but they always seem to be out when I'm there.The French fries are also pretty good, but note they need to be ordered separately, and once you start adding to your order, it's quite easy to run up the price of your meal.Limited seating, also means that sometimes you might need to wait too.",

Firstly, we were able to walk straight up to the counter and order - no wait! And you pay upfront so no need to spend the rest of the evening vainly attempting to wave down some hipster excuse for a server a la Meat Liquor.As for the burgers - the meat was excellent. Tasty, juicy, beautifully cooked. Extremely satisfying. Fries were good too. Don't make the mistake of shelling out \u00a31 for bearnaise sauce or whatever other weird condiment they have at the till. Just around the corner is the world's greatest selection of condiments, including horseradish, wholegrain mustard, caramelised onions and multiple types of BBQ sauce. I had them all! No need to be put off by the simplicity of the menu, therefore (which is basically: burger, or cheeseburger) as you can add all the flavours you need yourself. Highly recommended especially if you want something quick and casual that is decent value for money - \u00a310.50 gets you a burger, fries and soda.",
