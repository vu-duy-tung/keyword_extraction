Also they sell a huge selection of premium chocolates right outside which is a plus!",

The main thing I don't like about Burger & Lobster is that they don't take reservations its first come first serve and there is normally a long wait. If you want to avoid the line go to one of their less over crowded branches like knightsbridge (in Harvey Nichols) at 9.30 pm on a weekday. Also don't bring a vegetarian as there are only two options Burger & Lobster and they are both \u00a320. I would not recommend ordering a burger for \u00a320 as I find that overpriced but the lobster is well worth it. Also the side salad could use a little help, maybe a better salad dressing it is just an below average balsamic.",

I had read about the lobster roll trend but never managed to get to enjoy one so was pleasantly surprised when the person who met us at the top read the 3 item menu to us before seating us. The place was packed, we both opted for the lobster roll as opposed to the unshelled lobster or gourmet burger option. My fiance was a little hesitant at trying the lobster rolls but after some gentle persuasion she agreed to try it. The end result was that the delicious lobster meat was served in equally delicious brioche roll along with fries and a salad. The food was impecabble and well worth the price paid, we will definitely be going back for more of the same.",

Actually a good choice since the bartender who was also our waiter was very personable. There are three items on the menu, whole lobster, lobster roll and burger. We ordered all three. The food was served quickly and presentation was great. I had the lobster roll and there was plenty of meat in a mild dressing. The bread was disappointing, looked like a thick slice of regular bread sliced into a pocket but it was toasted (or fried) and had a spiced butter or oil on the outside. My colleague's lobster was meaty and good tasting (she said) and my other colleague's burger was huge and very juicy. We were very happy to try the place and will return if we get the chance.",

I suggest going for the lobster itself, as the lobster roll is, while yummy, quite small in comparison (and for the money). If anything, the desert menu could use a little upgrade, but there are plenty of places in the area to go for a desert afterwards. So just keep it simple and enjoy your lobster.The service is always impeccable. Just be ready for the inevitable wait (as there are no reservations) - but they do give you a buzzer so you can browse the store and look around until you're called for your table.",

Can't go wrong with either choice! We should know because I had a delicious lobster roll and my companion has a delicious burger, both served with yummy shoestring fries. Service was friendly and efficient. As a bonus, the restaurant is located inside Harvey Nichols department store, which is a whole lot better of a shopping environment than Harrod's.",

It also popped up on my newsfeed and I finally got to try it!There's only 3 main courses on the menu: burger, full lobster (steamed or grilled) or lobster roll which amount to \u00a320 each. We opted for the full lobster (steamed) and lobster roll.They are both to die for! So delicious since the full lobster was so juicy and full of meat, it was really fresh as well! I managed to get all the lobster out of its nooks and crannies (couldn't let it go to waste) and was fully satisfied after the meal.The lobster roll was served on a toasted brioche bread with lobster and mayonnaise inside, the dish is served cold, but the mixture of sweetness from the brioche bread and lobster alongside the saltiness of the mayonnaise made it a perfect combination! The chips were thin cut and crispy, it went well with both the lobster and lobster roll.The staff were all really friendly and you could tell they had a great synergy between them which created a good vibe in the restaurant.If you're in London or Manchester in the UK, you DEFINITELY have to give Burger and Lobster a try!",

I had to rectify this and so, off we went to this affordable lobster chain.This particular branch is just off the food hall of Harvey Nichols, on a quiet night in the store, the restaurant was buzzing. Could still get a table at 7.30pm on a Friday with minimum wait.They begin by telling you the 3 options, but not the 4th burger and half a lobster option. There's no starters or dessert menu, everything is rattled off by the waiter. There's a full drinks menu and we both had the rum, pineapple, jasmine and lime option which was excellent.Along came our lobster plates at break-neck speed. Impressive presentation and portions. Lobster was steamed and delicious in taste. The salad had unnecessary parmesan. They give you JUST enough butter sauce (but I'm a greedy girl) but the chips were undercooked, standard skinny fries.This place fails at customer service, only providing 1 meat-reaching device, not cutting all the shells so 2 people at 1 table had issues getting the meat out of the shells. Not filling up water, not bringing change, no thank you from reception as we left. I did appreciate the super thick napkins and the bibs though.Overall, I liked the lobster, the sauce and the price so I'll go back, just without expectations of service which is fine.

I read some great reviews on B & L while I was in my hotel room and decided the 30+ minute walk to get there might just be worth it. Once there, I found myself sitting at the bar. Immediately I was greeted by the bartender, Rikardo, who made me the most perfect Old Fashioned. I asked him about an item on the menu: a hamburger with melted brie, AND fresh lobster meat on top of that?? Insane, right? He said go for it. OMG! It was one of the most amazing, mind blowing experience, and (may I continue to say) it was orgasmic. It was a messy meal, but I had never been so happy as I was at that moment when I had burger grease slithering down my lower lip, melted brie hanging down my mouth, and lobster meat falling off my delicious burger. Rikardo happily provided me with a bib and extra napkins.I did not inhale. Quite the opposite. Took more than an hour to savor this dish with a couple of Old Fashioneds. The burger also came with a side salad and fries. B & L automatically adds a 12.5% service charge (it tells you that on the menu), which in my opinion was not enough for the excellent service I received. I was more than happy to add a few more \u00a3's. I was at the bar by myself and Rikardo really kept an eye on me. I appreciated that. 10 stars for service. 10 stars for the most mind blowing burger of my life. Side note: If any Boston chef is reading this, can you add this to your menu? Then PM me that you have it on your restaurant menu. I'll be right over. I am not kidding.",

    "text": "For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why I ate at Burger & Lobster multiple times during each visit to London. I can easily find better lobster rolls back home in the U.S. without being gouged by the painful pound-to-dollar exchange rate. But then it finally clicked: Burger & Lobster is the perfect place to people watch. This experience begins before you even decide to eat here. Maybe you're amongst actual Londoners, enjoying a stroll in nearby Hyde Park. Or maybe you're at Harrods down the street, mingling with other tourists, in awe of what must be the world's most extravagant department store. Maybe you've just gotten off a train at Victoria Station and push through hordes of commuters while realizing that you're absolutely starving.Don't worry, Burger & Lobster has got your back. Make your way to Harvey Nichols (again, mingling with locals and tourists alike), take the elevator up to the fifth floor, and get seated. if there's a wait, wander around on the fifth floor. There's a food hall here, and you can observe other visitors or flip through some reading material.Order the lobster roll. The lobster meat is fresh, succulent, and tender -- while I would have liked a bit more lobster, the garlic butter on the side is so good that it should be illegal. I was also surprised by how good the dressing on the side salad was.London is a melting pot of cultures and I love being reminded of this whenever I'm out and about. However, I didn't love being charged for tap water, but I guess that was just a reminder that I wasn't in the States anymore.",

We decided on the combo lobster and burger and wow oh wow were we glad we did. It was all cooked perfectly. We had a martini to start with and I must say it wasn't the best... but I think London town likes gin martini's over vodka so it is our fault for ordering a drink from our home town. I wish you would bring this restaurant to Dallas. We would be here all the time. Cheers!",

And the staff was pretty great, too.My choice was the lobster burger: 6oz burger topped with lobster meat, brie, truffle & tarragon mayo, fennel and Chinese cabbage. The flavors were great! Somehow lobster and beef marries well. I didn't taste the Chinese cabbage as much, but it was still delicious. The menu is limited and simple. I think this helps them succeed in executing consistently and quickly. We really don't need a hundred things on the menu and they offer what they say: burgers and lobster. You can get them together, or not and choose just a burger or just some lobster! (they also have a bean burger)I also loved my cider there which was local, Aspall Suffolk draught cyder.Just cause I was enjoying everything so much, I started chatting with the manager as he passed by about how good my experience was and how I can see how the execution is so well and understanding the concept, overall positive stuff - he was so kind and said, can I buy you (and your friend) another drink? Well, sir?! What -- I mean, yes! \u00a0He said it was a rough night with some complaints and I made his day by talking to him about good things. Now we were all happy! :) Yay!",

I do consider myself a lobster connoisseur, I've traveled and eaten great lobster from lobster well known States/country's but this lobster was absolutely amazing. Fresh Maine lobster is wonderful rich, sweet and luscious however I have a new favorite! I've never had such a delicious lobster, you can have it steamed or grilled, I choose grilled with a side of lemon garlic butter when it arrived I was speechless! It was a absolutely delicious experience. The burger was fantastic also great meat cooked to perfection, strange combo but it works! This is what enticed my friends and I to try it out. There are several locations we choose the Harvey Nichols location \"was the closest to us\" My friend had the lobster roll and was again the best roll I had sampled! Maine has nothing over lobster and burger London. Side not the lobster burger was equally delicious, Brie cheese tarragon mayo supurb! The good thing about going with friends is you get to sample everything! Appetizers was great also, but I recommend saving your appetite for the great lobster! Sorry Maine, London's got this one!",

Got a table after about 3 minutes which was great. You are paying for the location no doubt. There are burgers, lobsters and lobster rolls and combos. I had the Singapore Roll which was lobster and prawns with a spicy sauce. It was good. It was also 22 pounds. Burgers were good. Son had a burger lobster combo which he really enjoyed. Probably would be 4 stars if not so expensive. But worth it for the experience I suppose. Service was good. They added a service charge on the bill so no need to leave anything extra,",

They were juicy but lacking SO much seasoning. I had to douse it in salt, pepper, ketchup and mayo just for it to the some taste. As someone from Los Angeles, I would not recommend their burgers to anyone from America. Surprisingly, their NYC location is super popular... maybe they season their burgers there?",

I would say the garlic sauce hasn't been as good as previous years. While I was satisfied with my lobster meal, I'm starting to think that burger and lobster is becoming too commercialised and is starting to charge its customers at very steep prices. Service wasn't that great either - no smiles and long service. Overall, it's becoming a little overrated for a lobster meal.",

The \u00a325 lobster roll is jam packed with lobster -- definitely no skimping here. He chose a combo with the split lobster cooked two ways: grilled & steamed. I tried a forkful of the grilled & it was firm & delicious. Lovely butter sauce was sprinkled with chives & had a hint of garlic. Positive remarks for his burger, as well. It's no small triumph that they do both items named in their brand smashingly. Friendly waitress; nice vibe & bustling atmosphere; a good place to re-energize & be off your feet for a little while. Sidenote: their shell cracking apparatus, shaped like a lobster claw, required much strength & effort to use.",
