    "text": "I popped over to Borough Market this afternoon to buy some Jerusalem artichokes for a soup I'm planning to make this weekend (I thought it unwise to rely on our local Sainsburies and Tescos). I was very excited to spot a new chocolate cafe and shop just at the beginning os Stoney Street: Rabot Estate. Apparently, it is the Borough Market 'farm shop' of one of the oldest cocoa estates in St Lucia, dating to 1745. The founder of the Hotel Chocolat chain of shops (and website) bought the Estate a few years ago and have invested heavily in new cocao plants and upgrading equipment and systems. Rabot Estate is taking the lead in reviving the cocoa industry in St Lucia. The shop is pretty eye-catching and completely open to the street. It's decorated in lots of chocolate browns, with reclaimed woods, corrugated iron panels and simple stencil-style typography and manilla labels. However the pricing is anything but basic - \u00a38 for a bag of chocolate anyone? I decided to play to safe and bought myself a small bar of their 'Dash of Milk' range (mid-way between classic dark chocolate and milk chocolate) to try. The 35g bars come in at \u00a32.75 (however if you buy three they come at \u00a32.50 each). At the till I succumbed to temptation and had a hot chocolate (a more reasonable \u00a32.50 per cup). You can choose between a 70% cocoa or a 100% cocoa, which you can sweeten to personal taste. I went for the 70% option. This turned out to be very frothy and light - not particularly thick in texture but with a wonderfully thick chocolate flavour which coated my mouth and lasted a while. I think this might just become a Borough Market tradition for me. They also sell something called 'chocolate tea' which apparently was big in 18th-century London before hot chocolate caught on. I need to try that sometime. Also available are chocolate-themed savoury snacks. This place is a great addition to Borough market.",

    "text": "Rabot 1745 is trying to go back to basics to educate people on the cacao nut - its not chocolate, but its the nut that chocolate is made from. \u00a0And you can only call it chocolate when at least 4% sugar is added to it (a little tidbit that our waitress told us). \u00a0We started off the evening with cacao nut tasting and a short blurb from the waitress on the Ecuadorian nut. \u00a0Don't just pop it in your mouth like I did - make sure you crack the outside shell and eat the bean on the inside. \u00a0I've seen some TripAdvisor reviews who view the restaurant and stylish and innovative, I personally don't think the innovation side of it was executed that well as a whole. \u00a0On their desserts and hot chocolate - sure! \u00a0But on the appies + entrees, not so much. \u00a0Every single dish on the menu had cacao in it, and I was curious to know how the dishes would be enhanced. \u00a0But sadly, it didn't. \u00a0And I think the rest of the party felt the same way. \u00a0Some dishes were good - but I don't think cacao made a difference. \u00a0The beef carpaccio (\u00a39) was good but pricey - 3 slices of beef wrapped around some zesty celeriac and juniper dressing. \u00a0I would not recommend the guinea fowl (\u00a320), as it ended up being really dry and bland. \u00a0The jus was equally bland - I took a few sips from the little cup. \u00a0The fowl was served on an aubergine side which was tasty and tangy, so I had to include a bit of that in each bite. \u00a0Out of all the dishes, I think the best one was the roast lamb as it was very tender. \u00a0But again, even if the cacao was taken out of all the dishes, I felt that most of the dishes were just mediocre. \u00a0Come dessert - it seemed everyone was more interested in the chocolate desserts than the main entrees. \u00a0Our server said that the cacao experience is supposed to be more on the educational side, and not necessarily the highlight of their dishes, which will be \u00a0changed seasonally. \u00a0And while their dishes aren't too adventurous, it is meant to draw patrons to the restaurant - then when Rabot has a stronger reputation and foothold, they will probably branch out to create more adventurous dishes. My highlight of the evening? \u00a0The praline hot chocolate for \u00a33.50 is probably the best hot chocolate I've had. \u00a0Not crazy sugary sweet, I felt it tasted more like a praline drink with a hint of chocolate. \u00a0It was divine! \u00a0And this is coming from a person who doesn't regularly eat sweets / dessert or addicted to chocolate. \u00a0We bought a pouch of the hot chocolate (\u00a37.50), and while they do have a praline spread, I think there's a jar of Nutella at home that I will stir in. \u00a0Maybe I'm not the best person to be reviewing this restaurant, but I found cacao to just be a boring little nut. \u00a0It only added texture to the dishes, and didn't enhance anything. \u00a0I was wishing that they would have at least tried to make some savoury dishes using chocolate even, and this is coming from someone who's not a huge fan of chocolate.Anyway, the cacao nuts are roasted on site, and batches of chocolate are freshly made here. \u00a0But - I think my relationship with the cacao nut will only go as far as chocolate. \u00a0I'll come back on a cold day for a nice hot cup of chocolate, but that's it. \u00a0On the plus side, the diners all received 20% off on any purchases in their chocolate shop. \u00a0This is more of a 2.5 star rating for me. \u00a0I don't think I'd come back for the food, as I think I've definitely had better, though the carpaccio was delicious (but small =( )",

I have heard mixed opinions about their restaurant dishes but i never tried their main dishes myself so i cant really judge them on that.The Rabot Estate is in a great location (away from the noise of the main street) with a very enticing open front design. The only disadvantage of their design is that it can get a bit cold if you sit at the front tables during the winter.I have tried their normal hot chocolate, salted hot chocolate, coffee chocolate(mocha) and all of them are exceptional. I have also tried their chilli hot chocolate but i found the amount of chilli shadowing the great chocolate so i wont be taking that again.Of course If you visit you must also treat yourself to the amazing crepes they make (both with dark & milk chocolate) and also try the brownies.I heard they now opened a terrace so i will definitely going back during the summer to check it out & try the savory dishes.",

    "text": "Mmm.. I reserve to myself the right to edit the review at a second test.Following our event, we had dinner at Rabot 1745, and I was really looking forward to test some of their dishes.Following the advise from the maitre chocolatier, I chose the curry fish (cod) in chocolate nibs and yorkshire pudding topped with beef and chocolate gravy. Sounds delicious and difficult!First the starter, yorkshire pudding. Was it good? Yes it was, really. Nicely presented, flavorful and just well made, an optimal start The pudding was well made, while the beef is rare as written in the menu, and the chocolate gravy gives you that nice touch that tingles the back of your mouth and makes everything delicious. An optimal start.The cod. Now here comes the bad stuff. Ok I was unconvinced by the idea of the dish, I couldn't figure out how to put together cocoa with a fish curry without covering one flavor with the other, but because of the suggestion by the nice lady who led the chocolate lesson I went for it anyway. And the result was just as I expected: there is definitely too much curry inside the dish, which is ok if you are eating at a south indian restaurant and you are having a general fish curry, but here I want to have something a bit more raffinate on my dish, especially if you want to put together spicy and bitter tastes with white fish... I'm really sorry as I loved the place and the starter, but that main is a wrong step. The chips coming as a side were not great either, a bit soft. The sauces with chips were a bit too fat and buttery. I mean the whole could esasily be improved, for example if you leave the skin on the potatoes then you acquire a bit more of taste you need in order to go with the chocolate aioli, I mean it's not difficult, just think a bit about the dishes before you put them on the menu!In the end, I will try again this place as I think it's natural spot would be the lamb and the beef, hence I will update my review there, where it can gets a \u00b11!",

Then I realized that Rabot Estate only does one size of coffee. This is kind of a neat idea, because it makes things a lot simpler, but it's also tough because it takes away my choice in exactly how much of a caffeine overdose I want.The mocha itself was pretty good, though probably not worth the money I paid for it, since I didn't know what size I ordered when I paid.

I almost came back and ordered a second.If you are visiting Borough Market, this shop is definitely worth a stop in.",

    "text": "Went to the restaurant for brunch, sat in the very nice outside balcony seating area where they have heaters and blankets. I had the chocolate granola served with milk and maple syrup and it was delicious! It was a small portion that was quite expensive but you could tell the ingredients are high quality. Also had the peppermint and cocoa tea infusion which was perfect, much better than the disappointing hot chocolate that I've had previously at Rabot.The only downside was slow service- it took over 30 minutes to get a bowl of granola. Still, I will be visiting again.Concerning what is on offer downstairs in the cafe, I tried the chocolate brownie. Oh my goodness, it was a chocoholics dream. Massive chunk of gooey brownie packed with smooth chocolate lumps and with a drizzle of chocolate on top. Absolutely perfect. The hot chocolate, on the other hand, was a disappointment, could barely detect any chocolate in there at all, only frothy milk.",

    "text": "Like the mothership calling me home the Rabot Estate suddenly caught my attention while I was on my way out of Borough Market. The smell of fresh coffee wafted over and the sight of chocolate sealed the deal. Although a lover of the smell of coffee I've never really been one for the taste so I opted for a hot choc while my sister went for the latte. Wow, it was like a cup of melted chocolate, very rich but not too sweet. Perfection! I took a little wander around the store taking in the many slabs of chocolate ranging in flavours and cacao levels. They sell cacao nibs, now I'm not 100% sure what these are but it seemed to excite and please a group who had wandered in and from looking at previous reviews it looks as though they are popular in baking. They sell a chocolate cookbook too! I didn't purchase any choc on this occasion as I felt fatty enough from the hot chocolate and huge bratwurst I'd had in Borough Market but I do plan to return to try their 50% milk chocolate recommended by Tristan J and gingerbread-infused chocolate buttons. Mmm...some things are just worth being fat for!",

This meant I got a walk through of the store from one of the friendly members of staff; offered a sample of Chili Hot Chocolate, and then tried a Sweet Cocoa Crepe. The Crepe was superb, the batter infused with chocolate before being stuffed with a hazelnut chocolate sauce! Yummy. Apparently The Rabot Estate Cocoa Plantation in St Lucia is owned by Hotel Chocolat. The store in Borough Market is essentially a Hotel Chocolat outlet that also serves sweet snacks and drinks. Which is why you will find many Hotel Chocolat products also on offer here. I guess the rustic plantation feel of the place is more likely to appeal to a Borough Market audience, hence the rebrand for this outlet.",

And you nibble and savour it with relish, the great cacao connoisseur that you are. But where does that chocolate come from?Hot countries. Countries close to the Equator. That is to say, countries that are not in Europe. And how do they eat chocolate in these countries? Well, I can only imagine they eat it in large, broken slabs if the chocolate at Rabot Estate - the London shop of this West-Indies-based cacao plantation - is anything to go by.I condone eating chocolate by the slab.And the caf\u00e9 onsite seems the ideal place to get a hot chocolate or a mocha latte (if you're that way inclined).",

The foam was cold so I took a massive sip and the coffee was really unbelievable hot and the beans were burnt. The chocolate was ok but I guess I have been spoilt along the way and I think having burnt bean coffee and the chocolate together they didn't really compliment each other. Also I went to the wrong counter wasn't really spoken to all that nicely. Maybe the waitress needs a little holiday. On a positive note, the coffee part of the shop is nice and cosy and has a lot of places for singles or couples to sit and enjoy the atmosphere and people watch. Maybe check out their hot chocolates? Surely..?",

    "text": "Okay maybe I'm being a bit overzealous with the stars here, but I don't care. \u00a0A few weeks ago I was looking for cake recipes for my partner's birthday, and I found one that looked great! \u00a0Chocolate cake with white chocolate ganache. \u00a0The white chocolate ganache used cream that you infuse with cacao nibs, and while it seemed a bit complicated, it also sounded delicious. \u00a0Great! \u00a0One problem. \u00a0I couldn't find nibs anywhere. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0I went everywhere. \u00a0I found someone online, but it wasn't in enough time to get them in time for the birthday. \u00a0As an American transplant in the UK, it is a bit frustrating when attempting to find things that are commonplace in the US (unsweetened baking chocolate and nibs are two examples) when they are practically impossible to find in the UK. \u00a0I mean the cultures can't be THAT different can they? \u00a0Apparently so. \u00a0I had to change plans and bake a different chocolate cake (which called for unsweetened chocolate, and the best I could find was 90%... annoying). \u00a0Anyway, we were at the borough market the other day (picking up wine I believe because one of the wine merchants has amazing Sauternes), and we passed Rabot Estate. \u00a0On a whim, I ducked in, went up to someone and asked, \"Hey do you sell cacao nibs? \u00a0Not the chocolate covered ones, just the nibs?\" \u00a0Done and done. \u00a0They sell them by the espresso cupful. \u00a0For only two pounds a cupful. \u00a0I bought two for future use. \u00a0I also bought some chocolate bark with chili flakes which was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Not too spicy. \u00a0Anyway, they get 5/5 just for having cacao nibs. \u00a0I may be throwing stars around willy-nilly, but when it comes to finding the rare (in the UK) ingredients I need for baking, I don't take things lightly. \u00a0I'm planning a second birthday for myself this year just to make this cake.",

    "text": "London Bridge is simply one of my go/to places in London. It's situated on the modern yet hip south bank, very central and close enough to the city. Visiting Borough Market is just one of the many amazing places that makes food culture in London so extraordinary. The mix of appreciation of old and new, local and exotic and the amazing variety of cuisines from around the world. Though the restaurants on the edge of famous market are well catered to fit the requirements for locals and tourists. Fast service, efficient reception and professional manner. This certainly happened when I was claiming my gift voucher for afternoon tea at Rabbot 1745 with my other half. In corporation with Hotel Chocolate, the restaurants knowledgeable chocolate theme and specialisation in all things cocoa and chocolate was well in the spirit. The ambience with a small chocolate shop with cocoa and chocolate infused oils, pasta, confectioners and pastries with the warm pine-wood interior and brass details made the atmosphere very pleasant. Their selection of chocolate drinks and foods was mind-staggering. The hip wood stools and playful wooden patchwork in the wall of the restaurant makes it a perfect location for late lunch in a winter afternoon. In the middle of the busy bustle of London. A perfect place to meet a friend before heading grocery shopping and home. I have a weakness for white hot chocolates, and my boyfriend ordered the nutmeg hot chocolate. We received savoury sandwiches with chucked, ham, salmon and cucumber fillings. The scone don the second layer had a good airy consistency. The top layer of sweets were moderately nice, though I'd recommend they have a better selection of various chocolate pastries. As most of them had dark chocolate and nuts. Seeing how much of a chocolate mouse I am myself, this was never an issue. Though for the venue to portray their best selection of the varieties of chocolate, I'd say they should have included this on their sweet section for afternoon tea. As for some dark chocolate can be bitter. Overall an amazing place. The best for large warm hot chocolates. And for those chocolate lovers who want a bit more of an elaborate experience with an urban twist. And for those Heath enthusiasts wanting to go all out on their chest day.",

    "text": "We came here after reading about this restaurant in the evening paper and being in the area. \u00a0It was described as 'contemporary dishes influenced by the West Indies and Britain, with the savoury richness of cacao used as a subtle garnish, infusion and spice throughout'. \u00a0\"Great' we thought \"a Caribbean restaurant near where we are going for drinks, let's go\". \u00a0We managed to get a table booked for later on that night which, I thought remarkable given it was a sunny Friday evening after all!There is a small bar downstairs with a chocolate shop next door. \u00a0This restaurant is associated with Hotel Chocolat although you would not know this as it is rebranded to the restaurant.Upstairs there is another bar and the restaurant on the terrace overlooking Borough Market. \u00a0We were shown out little table and presented with the menus. They had very faint music in the background from a small speaker system. \u00a0You had to really tune in to hear it. \u00a0There was 'Caribbean' music in the modern sense. \u00a0To give the correct atmosphere, they could do with selecting more traditional music for the influence they were after.Whilst there was a good selection of foods to select from, we could not help wondering where the influence from the West Indies came into it more than the use of the Cacao bean with many of the dishes.We ordered salmon cakes and flat bread for starter. \u00a0The waitress came back to say sorry the salmon we ordered was not available but she had noted the wrong dish so we still got the cakes. \u00a0They were nothing remarkable, potato pieces could have been cooked a little further. \u00a0The dips with the flat bread were nice although could have skipped the chocolate one for a starter. \u00a0Although I love chocolate and almost a pudding person dream to have chocolate for starter, I really want to stick with savoury or sweet not mix.I ordered fish for main (the original fish on the menu was not available so they had a replacement). \u00a0This was nice served with a pumpkin mash. \u00a0The flavours worked well together and the fish nicely cooked.Now for dessert.....dessert please....??? Anyone?? \u00a0We waited for a good while then had to request the dessert menu. \u00a0Some yummy choices, with, of course the chocolate to accompany them. \u00a0Should be noted, this isn't the sweet manufactured chocolate many will know and love, but more the pure type so it can be a little bitter which may not be to everyones taste.I had sticky toffee pudding (that will be the British influence) which was OK. \u00a0I have had better I think.Service could have been a little better esp. as it wasn't that busy. \u00a0We poured our own wine most of the time with the waiters failing to top us up.The toilets seem to be in a secret door by the bar (which was busy so clearly a favourite here) and they are unisex.....! hmmm.They don't mention it but as I am a Hotel Chocolat member, I asked about their connection. \u00a0Then they let me know that you get 5% off the bill as a member just flash your card. \u00a05% isn't very much in the grand scheme of things but something is better than nothing I suppose.All in all it was OK here. I think the bar is more popular than the restaurant at this time but, I would come back if I was in the area and needed food and drink. \u00a0Definitely feel the 'West Indian' influence needed to be stronger. It doesn't have to be all Jerk this and Jerk that but there is more they could do with flavours and ingredients to pull this out more.",

The venison starter had a nice combination of flavour tho slightly towards the blend side.The sea bass and sweet potato main had really fresh fish and nice sweet potato inside, however the other side - spinach was completely off. It must be soaked in lemon juice and cacao overnight because it was so sour and too much cacao made my lips very numb. Both me and my friend tried the dish and we both agreed this dish was on the edge of being returned to the kitchen if it wasn't because fish being nice. The pork selection with cacao gravy had very nice gravy, flavour has a new twist but not overpowering. However the pork meat was disappointing. Two out of three pieces were super dry. We also ordered moose selection as dessert. It has grounded cacao bits on the surface which gives it a nice lift of flavour. I'd recommend this dish. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, staffs were friendly and fast. I got to try full 3-course with a taste of 2 different mains as \u00a317.45 each with a friend. However judging by the quality of food, I definitely wouldn't pay more than \u00a317 for a 3-course at this restaurant. Hope this helps!",

Reminded me a bit of a French ski lodge the interior also when you go to the bathroom you are surrounded amongst wooden walls with the noise of forest creatures before finding the door to the toilet. The staff are happy and very helpful. Food that we had me a beef pudding and my husband and hamburger was good size portions, hot and tasty. The chocolate that was used partially in our food was different and really did give our food a bit of a twist. I would deff eat at Rabot again especially is wanting a nice romantic meal as the lighting and the size of the restaurant is quaint. Just lovely.",

It was evening so everything was closed but I presume in the daytime this is a great spot to people watch. We went to start with a cocktail and they have a good list of unusual choices, however none took my fancy so I went for wine. For food, I had the aubergine curry which was good. Not very spicy and not a huge portion but nice fresh flavours. The best thing however was their signature-the molten chocolate pudding! Definitely have this if you go! Perfectly cooked and I would return for this alone!",

I originally came in wanting a latte with a shot of salted caramel vodka. However, since they are known for their chocolate, I decided to order a creamy hot chocolate with the shot of espresso and shot of salted caramel vodka. Overall, it was quite delicious and pretty unique because I don't know any place that adds alcohol to their cafe items in the states. The baristas were extremely friendly when my friends didn't like their drink and worked to make it more enjoyable for them. I overall enjoyed my experience here!",

    "text": "I came here last year, and totally forgot about it, I was in the kitchen making dessert, but then I had an opportunity to try their food.As you walk in, you are greeted by the big chocolate machine, showing you from bean to bar, which is pretty amazeballs! It is the roasting and conching method which is shown. Then you see that luscious chocolate pouring - mmmmmmmmmmmmm!Hotel Chocolat is the only chocolate shop in the UK that shows this method to those who walk into their shop. At least this way you know what you are buying, and how its made. Why is it called hotel chocolat, and does it really have a hotel? It sure does, in the caribbean, St.Lucia where their beautiful beans are grown!As for Rabot, they use the chocolate in every aspect of their food and drink, cocoa bitter cocktails, its even used in a burger that they make, like a chocolate ketchup almost. I had their drinking chocolate with salted caramel - talk about rich, thick and gulpy!!! Was not drinkable, had to remove the lid and sort of use a spoon with it! But it was very nice with the gingerbread - as I love gingerbread, but I think a balance of milk and chocolate is needed!I also had their molten chocolate lava pudding made from the cacao bean here on site, Rabot ice cream - nib infused. Was delicious!! Chocolate oozed out of the lava cake, wasn't a heavy pudding - relatively light which was surprising, worked really well with the nib infused ice cream. The contrast of sweet and bitter, as cocoa nibs aren't sweet at all! I'd happily go back just for that.It's good they sell chocolate, although they don't really have much of a selection, if you are looking for a vast collection - maybe try strand, covent garden etc. Also strand branch sells vegan chocolate which is pretty good!!!",

While this not always places you in the eye of the waitstaff, it more than makes up for the slight waits for their attention with its atmosphere. What's more is that this is enjoyable in winter too, as blankets are provided if you choose to sit on the terrace.The menu at Rabot 1745 is varied, with one element ever-present: cacao - whether your chicken is covered in a cocoa-rub, or cacao beans are sprinkled on top of your burger's brioche bun, the nod to the chocolatey heritage of the restaurant operated by the chain that owns Hotel Chocolat can be as subtle or loud in flavour, depending on your choice. As such no meal is ever off-putting in taste, and certainly not in appearance. With hot chocolate available as a pre-meal beverage, and great variety in cocktails there's something to whet your whistle at all times too, with plenty of non-dairy options if you were so inclined.",

    "text": "Hmmm I think this is a 2.5 rounded up to 3 review. The extra half a star is a bonus for trying to do something different and for the fantastic service from our server, MontyRabot have been spreading the gospel of good high end chocolate through their Hotel Chocolat chain. Their flagship shop has been in Borough Market for years but this has recently moved a short distance to new premisesThe ground floor still houses the retail shop and cafe but upstairs, you'll find their brand new restaurant. I was luck to be invited along by a friend in the first week that they were openThe restaurant is classy and well deorated. When we sat down, we found a little bowl of beans at each place setting. Being Yelpers, we were a little impatient and had a little nibble - ooh, very bitterBefore too long, Monty came along and seeing the evidence on trhe table, asked if we had enjoyed the cocoa beans. We confessed that they had been a little bitter. She then explained that the roasted beans weren't meant to be eaten whole. She taught us how to break open the shell, which is the bitter part, thereby revealing the inner cacao nibShe then gave us a little lesson about the origin of chocolate and how cacao nibs are savoury and it only turns into chocolate with the addition of sugar. Used in its natural state, cacao is a savoury product, almost tasteless but with a crunchThe USP of Rabot 1745 is that every dish on the menu contains cacao in some form. Between the 6 of us, we managed to try a good range of the dishes on the menuMy starter of fish carpaccio was nice but I'm not sure the few bits of crunchy cocoa nib added anything extra to the dish. That was the general concensus of the group - nice starters in flavour but the cocoa didn't really add anythingI was lucky in getting the best of main courses - a slow cooked piece of lamb, whcih was yummy. Unfortunately, my dining companions weren't as lucky. The other dishes, especially the sauces, lacked punchHowever, the cacao came alive in the desserts. A trio opf chocolate mousses showcased the different flavours of cocoa beans from different parts of the world - my favourite was the fruity Vietnamese. The chocolate tasting plate was also fun, giving a real variety of chocolate products including a 100% cocoa stick, which technically isn't chocolate as you need to add a minimum of 4% sugar to cacao to call it chocolateI take my hat off to the kitchen - the lovely plating reveals an ambition in the kitchen but I can't help feeling that using cacao in every dish is currently a bit of a gimmick. I can understand why Rabot wanted this USP but in many dishes, it served as a distraction and ultimate disappointment when it didn't really add anything to the dish. I'm not sure how they can solve this issue but perhaps to add dishes like Mexican mole, which does use chocolate to add depth to the sauce, may be a startA nice bonus was a card for a 20% discount in the retail store to be used that same eveningI wish them luck in their endeavour as I admire their bravery in trying to do something different",

The space is neatly designed to give a cozy feel and staff were pleasant. My husband and I both ordered the Coffee Chocolate which is the equivalent to a Mocha and it was delicious. It tasted so chocolately, unlike anything I have ever tasted before coffee-wise. The only negative is that they served this delicious drink in a white ceramic mug with no handle. It looked nice but it wasn't functional because the mug was hot hot hot causing us to wait for the coffee and mug to cool before we could sip down the liquid deliciousness. Also note that it looks like they recently opened a terrace which is probably cool.",

We were just so grateful to get a table, we didn't know we were in for such a fantastic experience. We were seated on the rooftop, which even on a chilly March evening was nice and cozy with heaters. This would be a great spot to eat lunch while the market is bustling!The food was some of the best we had in London. I'm sure everything would have been great, but our server was super confident in his recommendations when we asked \"this or that\" while ordering, and everything we ordered was fantastic. Service when we were first seated was a little slow (seemed to be a bit of confusion over who was serving our table) but once that was straightened out the service (by all) was warm and attentive.Rabot 1745 is at the top of my recommendation list for anybody visiting London!",

    "text": "Ok, so I ended up here my accident. My friends and I were originally supposed to go to a Padella, then tried to go somewhere else only to find it was closed, and thus lost our place in the ever-growing queue. Why do restaurants in the always-busy Borough Market close?? In any case, clearly Rabot has realised this issue because they were open at the awkward time of 4:30 pm when we wanted an early dinner. I've known about the restaurant because of the Hotel Chocolat brand, but it never really occurred to me that I would want to eat a full meal of chocolate-inspired dishes. If you don't spend too much time overthinking it, it's not like everything tastes like chocolate - they just try to use various derivatives of the cocoa bean. We sat outside on the terrace, where you can hear what's going on downstairs at the market, and also feel the trains going by every now and then. None of the mains spoke to me, so I ordered two starters - the pulled pork piton and a fried fish dish. They were both good, but very small, and served in very large plates. I'd say that Rabot styles itself in the more fine dining end of the spectrum. My friends got the hake, burger, and chicken mains, and I'd say they were all small except for the burger. Then again, I'm not sure how the burger fits in with the whole fine dining idea. I don't think I'd see myself coming back, except for the fact that they happened to serve food when not many other places did.",

    "text": "If you fancy yourself a chocolate connoisseur and a Snickers bar just won't do, you need to bring yourself to this slightly-pretentious chocolate shop/ restaurant/ cafe.I would say it's like the Max Brenner of London- think Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory for adults. They use only the most premium chocolate and ingredients in their drinks and food, and almost everything is chocolate-inspired, yet not necessarily sweet.The sweetness of their drinks is not overpowering, and the notes of whatever is in them come across perfectly-balanced; if it's a hazelnut latte, you can really taste the hazelnut without all the sugar, and if it's the spiced chocolate, you can really taste those spices. Some like the salted caramel are a bit sugary, but no less delicious, and if you have a chance to come back, always give their seasonal drinks a try. The Spooky Boo with salted caramel, spiced pumpkin, cocoa, and super-thick whipped cream during the Fall is amazing!They also have a cool little section where you can take away some packaged chocolate and boozy chocolate-inspired drinks from Hotel Chocolat that I guarantee are among the highest quality out there.If you decide to dine in their actual restaurant upstairs, get ready to shell out some serious dough for some dangerously-delicious cuisine. Yes, there is still chocolate, (or at least cacao), in most of their dishes, but it is there more to bring out the essence of whatever you're eating rather than overpower it. The Bois Bondais was perhaps my favorite meal there, as the chicken and vegetables are cooked to perfection and the sauce really serves to bring everything together with a simple, yet beautiful, presentation, to boot.The cocktails, are really something else. My absolute favorite is the Salted Caramel Soother made with a Salted Caramel vodka from Hotel Chocolat and sprinkled with crushed cacao bits for a bit of a crunch. It may be one of the more perfectly-balanced cocktails you will ever have in your life. They also serve chocolate-infused beers and fruity wines that just happen to be on the sweeter side.Oh, and did I mention that for an extra \u00a31.50 you can spike any of your coffees or hot chocolate drinks here with salted caramel vodka, even during the day? Yeah.",

    "text": "We came for a decadent dessert and cocktail... What we got was shoddy service, average cocktails and a dessert we didn't order.I was so unimpressed this time round and so very glad we had eaten salads from M&S before we came for dessert.I had bought 2 Timeout vouchers for the famous BAFTA award dessert, which was basically chocolate upon chocolate, and cocktail for \u00a315 (the dessert itself it just shy of this) and turned up at 9pm on a Thursday to enjoy after the cinema. The voucher states explicitly not to book sooo we didn't. It was fine anyways as there was plenty of room. We were seated. Our vouchers were taken. Our cocktails were ordered. We were then told the dessert would take an hour to prepare as they had stopped making them each day as they took so long. Also to be told that we should have rung ahead to let them know we were coming.... So rude. Instead of waiting we could order the desserts from their menu (\u00a38-10). Unfortunately we weren't planning on returning to the area before the vouchers ran out, and I definitely wasn't waiting an hour to be served dessert so we instead picked our dessert from the normal menu. These came out with the cocktails after 10/15 minutes. We opted for the White chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake. Neither were anything special. The cocktails were also okkkk but by then I just wanted to drink up and go home :(All in all a bad experience especially after I was so looking forward to going!",

Unfortunately, my experience started a little wobbly as I was given a Diet Coke in a dirty glass. The residue from some kind of milky chocolate drink was still clinging to sides and to my horror, did not start floating to the surface of MY drink until I'd drunk half of it. The waitress quickly brought me a new one but wasn't particularly apologetic.Starters arrived in good time (bearing in mind we only ordered one to share between us, the French onion soup)but we waited an hour for our main meal to arrive. This is despite the restaurant only running at 50-60% capacity.The robot burger was delicious and the fries were super crispy but I didn't manage to eat much as we only had 18 minutes to cram it all in, thanks to the long wait time and a show to get to in another location.The Cote Du Rhone wine was excellent but again, I couldn't finish an entire carafe of wine in the 18 minutes we had left. Another member of staff did come over to speak to us and very kindly apologised for the long wait time. He also took the cost of the drinks off the menu, which was nice but I'd rather just have a clean glass for my drink and enough time to finish my meal in the future, haha!Hopefully, I'll be back to try this place again the future.If I do, you can look forward to an update on the service!",

Which I guess that's also my only complaint, it's not exactly a neighbourhood area, so they make you work for your coffee (travelling there).",

This was, hands down, one of the most interesting food experiences I've ever had. Going into it, I was unsure of how well one could incorporate chocolate into savory dishes. I love food so much, but I'm not really a foodie in the traditional sense as I tend to steer clear of anything I find pretentious. Rabot 1745 does a really beautiful job at making something unique without making it annoyingly so. Sure, there's cacao in every dish, but it's so subtle that all it does is enhance the flavor of whatever you're eating. Sadly, I was so full that I did NOT get to try the dessert here. But it only gives me more to look forward to on my next visit!I would highly recommend the Yorkshire pudding stuffed with white chocolate mash & the burger. Be sure to make use of the cacao ketchup for your chips! If you're in the mood for something new, give this gorgeous place a try. Bonus: it's super romantic!",
