    "text": "The opulent (and obviously masculine) dining room feels designed to appeal to the international expenses crowd: without a view, you could easily be in Dubai, Chicago or Singapore instead of London. Deals are to be done here gentlemen... over steak, expensive wine and casual misogyny. That's a tad judgemental and almost certainly untrue but, being only a Rolex-throw from Mayfair, it is at least plausible.It has a vaguely Mid West American inspired opulence, though my descriptor is as lazy as the broad theming. Call it essence of robber baron... Thick, plush, arterial-red carpets? \"make 'em plusher\". Gilded, glowing fittings? \"make 'em golder\". Bulging list of rare American varietals in a leather-bound list? \"make 'em rarer, and add a zero on...\" The shock is that it's not American, but Danish. Despite channelling Smith & Wollensky or Chicago Cut, it comes from the land of stripped pine and Arne Jacobsen chairs. The only sign of this Scandinavian heritage on the menu came with a trio of Danish-origin 70 day dry-aged steaks. I'm not averse to the Stilton-like joys of aged steak, but a 45 day aged piece I had recently from the Ginger Pig bordered on overpowering at times, and anything getting close to 70 is going to be considerably and challengingly funky.Diving straight in, bypassing a relatively uninspiring starter list, we shared a surprisingly petit USDA Prime Porterhouse. It was wheeled up to be carved on a butcher's block. I was hoping for a lot from an expensive if troublesome cut. Advertised as fit for two or three, in truth it was probably only enough for one and a half or two with sides and starters. The problem with porterhouse is that you have two different cuts, sirloin and ribeye, separated by the thick T bone. Lesser chefs risk missing the balance and pushing the sirloin to a med/well, or leaving unforgiving ribeye fat un-rendered. As far as steaks go, this was a good 'un. Rich, buttery and with a decently deep flavour, it did everything a good steak should.Along with that hunk of prime meat, sides were measly for the price, and fine, generally just fine. Like supporting dancers in a meaty musical. Chilli fries came with a crunch and a crackle of heat, while a soothingly bland mac n cheese ticked our other carby box. You can't object to either, but at \u00a34.50 a pop, I want to have the best darned carbs in the city. With a cocktail before, a digestif and a one of the cheaper wines (the leathery New World spell book unsurprisingly offered little below \u00a340), we managed to splash \u00a3225 for two, certainly more than I'd expected.Tangentially, I remember being told by the International Man of Mystery, no stranger to the jet set, that this bland luxe internationalism is welcomed by many who spend half their lives in assorted high-end business hotels. \"They want reassuringly expensive stuff they recognise, with the odd plain local speciality, because it's impossible to know how an authentic, highly spiced x, y or z is going to go down when you don't know which continent you're on and your body thinks that it's 4am...\" With that in mind, MASH fits the bill perfectly. Just don't expect to see me back without the expense account.",

The food was again incredible but the place is like a morgue. there are far too many tables and partitions all over the place so you can't see anyone around you. If you wanted to have a raunchy session in between courses you'd probably get away with it! The more vibrant Balthazaar, more intimate Hawksmoor, sexier Le Relais de Venise or the much cheaper Flat iron are way better and serve the same quality food.

    "text": "The only reason why I hang around Andrew M so much is because he is always on top of the game when it comes to getting the inside scoop on restaurant launches, soft opening resos, special deals.. on the flip side, he's also the reason why my pants no longer fit (I'm Canadian, yes, I said pants). To celebrate MASH's 1 year anniversary, they had a 50% discount on their main dishes. \u00a0This was great news for me - I love a good steak but the regular pricetag here is a bit much for me. Andrew and I decided to share the American rib-eye (600 grams), and the Danish longbone (500 grams), both priced at round \u00a348 before discount. \u00a0I wasn't sure I wanted to go for the Danish cut since a few reviewers said not to bother, but Goetz said to try it, so I went with it.. and I'm so glad we did! \u00a0It was a favorite of the evening, aged 70-75 days, cooked rare, and there was definitely a stronger and meatier presence in the flavour. \u00a0I usually like having a bit of sauce on the side, but I didn't bother as I enjoyed the flavor of the longbone on its own.We had a few different starters and sides to share, including a steak tartare, shrimp linguine, sweet breads, foie gras (all at \u00a39.50 each), chili fries, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, green beans, and grilled chili peppers (at \u00a34.50 each). \u00a0My personal favorite was the steak tartare - it was my first time trying it, and it was velvety smooth, and I'm not too sure what else they put in it but it was excellent. \u00a0I think it was something bordering lemongrass or ginger. \u00a0I would personally skip over the shrimp linguine (nothing special), and foie gras, as it didn't have that rich and smooth melt-in-your-mouth texture. \u00a0The sweet breads - everyone seemed to like this, but I'm not crazy about the texture of it.. so I wouldn't order it again. \u00a0Also just to note - chili chips isn't referring to American meat chili on top of fries (booooo!!), its just chili spice on the chips, though I didn't sense much heat. \u00a0Mashed potatoes were nice, creamy and buttery! \u00a0For dessert, I ordered a scoop of the pear sorbet and coconut ice cream. \u00a0I love both coconuts and pears, and they were really tasty, but coconut seemed to be a fan favorite at the table. \u00a0The rest of the evening went off without a hitch, the service was excellent, everyone ordered a cocktail or two, we even ordered a bottle of Magnum wine to share. \u00a0With a few more desserts, the final split came to about \u00a370pp after discount. \u00a0Not bad considering all the food we got! \u00a0I'd definitely come back again (.. when I get a job..)",

Ordered American steak and chips for for kids to share at GBP 25 . Steak tiny and lots of fat and sinew. \u00a0Fries soggy and smelled of fish. 4. Shared a medium rare Omaha NY bone in strip, which came rare unseasoned and was cut end to end at the table. \u00a0Was claimed to be 600g. I have had this in the US and couldn't finish it, though here they claim a lot of the fat renders and the bone is 75g. Very small and very fatty. \u00a0Final note on the steak : if serving table side, cut in the center and ask customer if acceptable. Ours was cut end to end and rendered useless to fire for a few more minutes. 5. Onion rings great.6. Tomato salad, weird shallots and herb dressing, but fine.7. Mac and cheese like from a tin, though served (poured) in a skillet.8. Fries were re-done and fine with excuse that a fuse went in frier and oil wasn't hot. A terrible excuse for any restaurant, let alone a \u00a0GBP 42 (USD 80) steak. How can't a chef see a grease pool of soggy fries, let alone not taste and let it through the pass?9. Was offered a coffee (passed) and also was topped up a glass of wine.10. Claimed to be a Danish version of an American steak house. Well, I and my 2 adult and 2 child guests have eaten at many steak houses across the US and all that Mash currently emulates is the \"setting\" of a high end steakhouse. 11. Completely style over substance.12. Real shame, as it could be great if they to had chef and kitchen that understood how to use their quality ingredients to make good basic food. .13. Shocked at why investors would let a shambolic and truly poor kitchen allow their investment and great ingredients to go down the drain. It ain't rocket science to make a good steak and fries! (and I and many others would pay top dollar if they did it right)14. Amazing wine list15. Staff consisted of host and well trained and meaning waiters. Never saw a Manager or Maitre D, and amazed that the person dealing with the complaints was the poor waiter. 16. Great setting. \u00a0Disappointing food. \u00a0Good service. \u00a0Badly managed. \u00a0Unjustified and expensive pricing.",

    "text": "Friday night, no dinner reservation, 650pm, where can i go with clients?? MASH was seeming the only \"decent\" place I could find. We were greeted in style and from that moment on the service was impeccable. The staff are the best thing about this establishment. Situated in a basement with, what i am told, priceless interior fixtures and fittings from the start of the 1900's the place feels grand but to me this grandness made the place feel hollow and without soul. Its cavernous expanses were a little overbearing. We all stopped at the bar for a cocktail before being seated and there were no qualms about the tipples we were presented with. The bar had Soho-ista faux media types and their Panerai Luminor watches dripping off their wrists surrounding it so thankfully we were escorted to our tables before I had the chance to bump into Patrick Bateman. We had a lot of space and found the seating very comfortable and convivial to a decent evening then the wine got flowing and we ordered our starters: bland foie gras and mediocre carpaccio. We moved on to the steaks for mains and this is where I got MASH'ed off. No one enjoyed their steak. Don't get me wrong the steaks were cooked to order exactly but I was just very disappointed with the quality of the meat. For those prices, I expected to have my head blown off with by a bovine symphony. It felt more like a church hall than the Royal Albert Hall. We had dessert and coffees - the cheesecake and sorbet was very good and then then indigest... i mean the bill came. 450 smackers! Say whaaa. We all agreed by a country mile this was the most overly priced meal we'd ever attended in London. If we get Albert Hall we pay the Kings ransom, fair enough, but for this mediocrity, give me a break. Goodman's WIPES the floor with this place, easily. And Hawksmoor canters past it. I'd even choose Sophies steak house just for the value for money. Get real MASH and find better cuts.",

    "text": "From the outside, MASH doesn't really stand out as anything special. In fact, I walked past it a couple of times, before I realised that that was the place (which probably says more about my focussed dependency on Google Maps when walking around, than the restaurant itself).But then you wander inside, and venture down the spiral staircases into a large room which wouldn't look out of place as a hip Art-Deco ballroom (minus Can Can girls and Flaming Skittles Jugglers). The main room has high ceilings and wide spaces, and though it seems loud, you can have a conversation without needing to raise your voice.We were seated at the bar, where we ordered a couple of 'El Prado' cocktails (which considering my name is Prad, it would have been criminal not to have!) and they were very delish - El Prado comes Prad recommended!When seated, we picked out our favoured steaks from the menu (Bone in Rib-Eye for me please, Medium-Rare) as well as haricot-vert and the much talked about Mashed Potatoes.Ah yes - the Mashed Potatoes. Our waiter talked a big game about the Mashed Potatoes, ensuring us that it was \"The best in town\". Now I don't want to boast about my connoisseur-experience of Mashed Potatoes across this fine city of London, but I've had my fair share and I was more than up for this epic-battle of the Beaten Spuds.So my verdict?Yeah, their Mashed Potatoes are very good. Like, very very good.But clearly nobody goes to a Steakhouse to sample the Mashed Potatoes. Unfortunately, the same deference \u00a0didn't seem to be given to the Steak. Although it was good, it wasn't *fantastic* - it was rather on the chewy side, and didn't have the rich taste I'd have expected in this price range. Basically, I've had *better*. If you're going to charge \u00a360+, I expect to be carried out of the restaurant on a stretcher, in a meat coma.That said, it is several grades above those Gastropubs which are quietly cooking up Supermarket beef cuts, and doubling the price (Tut, tut).Overall, MASH is a great restaurant and a fine steakhouse if you're feeling particularly rich, or want a good place for a celebratory meal. And at the end of the meal, your bill will arrive in an envelope marked 'The Damage'.Quality.",

What self respecting Londoner wants to boast of having feasted on a fine steak in Piccadilly Circus? But maybe she can think of it as a Brewer Street institution rather than a Piccadilly hotspot? Of course, as she squirms her way into the not so labyrinthine sub terrestrial art deco space, she is greeted by this almost eerily formal, yet friendly atmosphere made up of happy, increasingly content diners.We ordered the foie gras, the smoked salmon and the steak tartare. Needless to say the steak tartare hit the spot. MASH has steak cuts from different countries, Uruguay, Denmark among others, and US and Australia. The steaks are exhibited in a fridge. there's a good choice of steak sauces to serve by the side.I had creamy mashed potatoes and bone marrow by the side of my Wagyu piece.Overall, while I will still give Hawksmoor half a star over MASH, I'm going to come back happily for more of that Wagyu and Uruguay steak.",

That shake was well-presented and tasty enough, though the paper straw proved a bit of a design flaw towards the end when its shake-logged structure made it difficult to finish off the last bitBut that's not what really impressed me here. Rather it was the space: the high ceilings, booths, low-lighting, and classic styling.

    "text": "If there was a way on Yelp to give this place a 3.5 rather than a 4, that's what I'd do... but in this case I decided to round up.Atmosphere: 5/5Bar/Drinks: 5/5Food: 3/5Service: 4/5Value: 3/5In short: this is a cool place, but it's a bit hit and miss. The bar is absolutely fantastic, and stores one of the largest collections of bourbons (known brands and small batch) that I've ever seen in London. The restaurant... well, the steak is good. Get the American Rib Eye, forget the Danish aged meats, and don't bother with any of the fancy sides, and avoid the steak tartare. Dessert go for the profiteroles. Everything else is meh. Read below for more details.If I could split this review into 2, one for the bar, and one for the restaurant, that's what I'd do. The bar is a 5/5 experience. Troels, the bar tender who was serving me, mixed me an amazing Old Fashioned using FEW Spirits Rye whiskey, one of my favorite spirits currently. It was perfectly balanced, and delectable; just enough bitter, and enough Rye to melt my liver. Plus, he's a good guy. We had a nice chat about Paul Hletko's cheeky line of FEW spirits, including a nice 'side bar' discussion on what goes well with their Barrel Aged Gin, which is absolutely fantastic and wonderfully aromatic. Thanks to Master of Malt and Ginuine Spirits for bringing such fine, lesser known spirits into the UK. Disruption at work, ladies and gentlemen.I then proceeded to have another with Bernheim Original Kentucky Straight Wheat Whiskey. Packs a bunch, but my god, is that smooth. I will definitely be going back to have drinks at the bar, especially since it wasn't overly crowded at 7pm on a Friday night. Busy, but not packed. Now for the restaurant... was really looking forward to a hopeful alternative to The Hawksmoor's clear domination of London's American Steakhouse landscape... despite having rolled out many more restaurants through out the city, including one conveniently located on Air Street of Piccadilly, Hawksmoor is extremely hard to book last minute... a good problem to have, but frustrating to the say the least. Ok, ok, this is not a review about Hawksmoor, so let's get back to MASH.The starters are decidedly meaty in nature, going from the ubiquitous beef carpaccio, to a foie gras terrine, and OH! What's that? Steak tartare? Droooool. I then proceed to interview our Danish server on the tartare, asking him if it's knife cut or made using a grinder (grinder, boo!!!!); what's in the seasoning (chili, pepper, etc....). It sounded promising, and I ordered it. Put simply, it wasn't great. So much so, that I didn't finish it. The meat might have been good, but it was really kind of mushy (grinder 'oblige'), the seasoning was bland, and it was served with crisps... hmmm.For steaks we ordered the Uruguayan fillet, the American rib eye, and the danish bone-in rib eye. All steaks were cooked to perfection (medium rare), and sliced for us to share, table side. Personally, I don't care much for the 20 month dry-aged version of the Danish steaks... yes, they have more flavor, but the lack of natural marbling makes me lean towards to American, corn fed versions that have a bit more render.My problem with MASH wasn't the booze, nor was it its flagship steaks. My problem with MASH is with regards to its sides, which were pretty disappointing. The bone marrow was spongy, not nicely seasoned, and very rubbery in texture. I know what you're thinking... it's bone marrow, what did you expect, Shy? But there's rubbery, and then there's silky smooth...The fries were mushy, and were left untouched. The cream spinach was smothered in cheese, which really wasn't necessary. The spicy chopped jalapenos weren't hot in the least.The bill came down to about 80\u00a3 per person (with wine and cocktails). Yes, it's pricey. But so are all the high end steak houses in London (and around the world... ). But for 80\u00a3 I'll get a better food experience at Hawksmoor or a fuller American experience at Balthazar. But, as a less crowded alternative to the American Bar, or the craptastic Bob Bob Ricard, the 1 hr queue at Pitt Cue Co. for cocktails in Soho, MASH is great. Will definitely come back for drinks, and just steak with green salad (probably a healthier course of action). Or just keep eating steak at Hawksmoor.",

    "text": "We booked for the pre/post theatre menu as we were seeing a show last night and arrived a little early so we were shown to the bar to wait for our table. It is an absolutely stunning restaurant and we couldn't believe all this was under the streets of Soho. At the bar I had a MASH Pilsner (fresh and clean as you'd expect) and my wife had the Cidre Breton which she very much enjoyed.We were shown to our table and had a very attentive waiter who provided us with menus and water. We ordered, American steak with mashed potato (sirloin) for my wife and the Uruguayan rib-eye with mac and cheese for myself. We also ordered 2 lemon meringue pies. This is where the disappointment started to set in. From the point we ordered to the point food arrived on our table it was about 40 minutes. It was not busy in the restaurant and it was the beginning of evening service so I would NEVER expect to have to wait 40 minutes for 2 steaks in these circumstances. To top it off, the couple on the table next to us arrived after us, ordered after us and received their food before us. (Not to mention the fact that they kept asking the waiting staff to take pictures of them and their food with us awkwardly trying to enjoy our evening in the background)The food, when it arrived, was very nice indeed. My wifes' steak was cooked to a perfect well done and mine, although a little rarer than I would normally have, was delicious. The sides and sauces were also very good. After the delightful main, we were excited for the lemon meringue pie which is one of our favourites. What arrived was not lemon meringue pie. Sure, it was a pie and there was some curd in it with the tiniest bit of meringue covering it, but it could barely be called lemon meringue pie. The pastry and the ice cream on the side were the best bits. The curd hardly tasted of lemons at all and the meringue was millimetres thick.This was a disappointing end to the meal which otherwise would've been fine.I would definitely return and try something off the a la carte menu and also take up the recommendation of a friend and try the bone marrow side.I'm sure the timing of the service was an aberration and that if I returned it would be better. I look forward to that return visit.",

    "text": "In short: Go there. Get some Danish prime beef. I had a sirloin steak and it was one of the best steaks ever. They also have wonderful wines. And do delicious desserts.Last Saturday I went down to take a look at this new London meat temple, MASH - Modern American Steak House. As I didn't know how busy the evening might be, I went there quite early. Nice smiling staff were greeting me when I entered the premises. Now comes a little surprise, as the restaurant is deep down below the surface. So I walked down the enormous and nicely styled stairs before I arrived at the second reception. Even more beautifully smiling staff were waiting to serve me. Quickly I was shown my table and got the menu to learn about their treats. First, the dining hall is huge. With a high ceiling and warm colours. It was not too busy, but I reckon even when it is busy, it is not as loud as some other well-known London steak restaurants. I have to admit, that I felt a bit awkward when I arrived and there were so many staff standing around and waiting for me (or any other guest coming down the stairs). But again, I was coming early, and they just opened a few weeks ago, probably they just play safe to be sure they really do well in the first weeks.So I looked at the wine list. It's a long and impressive list. Even if you're not planning to buy a bottle, you find a decent selection there. I only couldn't find the wines by the glass at first. Simply because they're not on the wine list, but on the regular menu. That solved, I could look for some pleasing drink. I was interested in two whites, one was the recommendation by the waiter - or sommelier - and the second was some US Riesling called \"Kung Fu Girl\". After I couldn't decide, I was offered to simply taste both and then decide. Great service! I sampled the Kung Fu Girl with it's cool name and the stylish label. It tasted interesting, but I liked the recommendation, Seresin, Sauvignon Blanc, NZ, much better. So I ended up with a few sips of the tantalising Kung Fu Girl, and then could indulge in this beautiful Seresin. Not surprisingly, the wine went down well with the tasty bread and butter. Again, very friendly and attentive service.Once the wine was sorted, the next challenge came up. Choosing the main. I knew, that I wanted some steak, but unfortunately that decision fell short of narrowing down the menu by much. Before I went there, I read that they are a Danish company, so I selected one of their Danish options - a sirloin steak. Usually I mostly go for fillet, but I just could not resist trying the \"up to 70 days\" aged Danish prime beef. I might be biased, as I have sort of a weak spot for most things Scandinavian, but this sirloin really beats most fillet steaks in tenderness and taste. Easily. It was very delicious and moist, with a great crust. I'm not a big fan of their bernaise sauce. The pepper sauce was nice, although it was no peppercorn sauce. The chips were good as well and crispy, but nothing spectacular. But the sirloin was just great. Best without sauce, then you taste much more of this great meat. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake with raspberry sorbet, and liked it almost as much as the steak. The coffee, well, it is okay, not too bad, but unfortunately not as good as the other offerings. Like at most other restaurants.In my opinion, MASH London is one of the best - if not the best - steak houses around. If they keep the service up like this, even when busy and once the first few months behind, they will definitely be a strong contender in the London meat competition. I'm already looking forward to going back to have another steak!",

It was evident that the grill top was not hot enough as the char marks were almost non-existent. The sides were nothing to write home about, as an example the Mac and Cheese, which has now become a steakhouse staple, showed up dry and tasteless. The harsh criticism comes from over the top prices with underwhelming steaks. Service was on par and the ambiance is quite nice but I would not recommend this as a top steakhouse in London.",

The lights are quite dim at night but you can still see the menu at least.We went there for the 50% off Japanese waygu steak deal and unfortunately this was sold out. We were offered the Australian waygu steak at 50% off instead and 4 of us diners ordered 800g of medium rare steak. The steak was really nicely cooked and melts in your mouth. I didn't like the fact that there were a bit of fat on some of my pieces of steak but this is personal preference. It was very nice that the waiter would offer to cut up your steaks for you (looks like flat iron steak at the end!).Sides were very good as well. Chilli fries was a huge portion. The cheesy spinach was also a hit for cheese lovers. I didn't like the bone marrow myself but then this is not a side I would normally order.Meal was pleasant, and it was perfect for a special occasion.Food and drink (1 bottle house wine, still water + 1 cocktail) came to approx \u00a340 per person with the 50% off wagyu steak offer.",

    "text": "West End steakhouse, centrally located near Piccadilly underground, serving deliciously cooked steaks from the usual sources and also from Denmark, which I would recommend trying. Oddly though mash isn't available on the menu although you can 'special' order it!Didn't get as far as deserts so can't comment. There is a reasonably priced selection of wines on offer but don't expect much change from \u00a3100 pp although that did include 2 pre lunch cocktails. On that note the service at the bar was very disappointing for such a stylish restaurant. Make sure you are fit enough to negotiate the long staircase to the basement rest from street level.",

    "text": "We popped into MASH for late night cocktails after dinner and a wander round Lumiere festival.Tucked away two floors below street level, and on a quietish Sunday night, MASH had quite a secretive & illicit vibe.The venue itself is majestic, with two flights of red carpeted stairs leading down to a bar and dining room. With dim atmospheric lighting and retro American style decor, it definitely had a stylish vibe and very much impressed. We sat in the bar area, and were presented with a cocktail menu consisting of a book of postcards, one for each cocktails. The friendly barman brought us a small bowl of tasty popcorn to nibble on while making our choice, and even bought out another bowl when we'd got through the first one!After much musing on fancy-sounding ingredients, I went for the Spanish Harlem Cocktail - featuring a sunny lineup of gin, saffron, orange marmalade, vanilla, elderflower and lemon. It was fantastically fruity without being overly sweet, and the cranberry wrap for the straw was a wonderful touch. My companion went for the West Side Apertivo, which definitely tasted like tequila but still very drinkable, its intriguing combination of ingredients (tequila, Kamm & Sons, rhubarb, apple, lemon, almond, pink peppercorn syrup) offering up an unusal but satisfying taste.I'd definitely like to go to MASH for steak at a later date, as the cocktails were very enjoyable and I loved the feel of the place.",

But once you get down there it's amazing - the bar is sensational and the actual dining room is vast and really just the finest looking steakhouse I've ever seen.We each had a steak, I enjoyed mine but my wife had a dry aged one and we both found it too game-y. But that's personal preference, as we know it was good steak, just not to our tastes. The one thing I adore here is the bearnaise sauce which is like flavoured butter that you can dip your steak into. Heck, you'd be able to dip pretty much anything into it and it'd be great.",

    "text": "Steak restaurants are one of my favourite types of restaurant in general, and I finally got to give MASH a try last week!It's certainly the most impressive Steak restaurant I have eaten at...it's huge! Really nicely laid out, and plenty of staff to cover it's vast area! You burn your steak off with the long walk to the toilet and back!In terms of the food, I was expecting big things! And it was awesome, however it wasn't as good as Goodman's (number 1 for me) or Gaucho.The Steak itself was lovely, I had the 400g American Ribeye Meidum Rare which was lovely. However I tried a couple of other cuts that people on the table has and wasn't as impressed. I actually could not eat the bone in RIbeye as it was very chewy. However the reason this isn't a 5* is the starters. We tried all of them (literally). Then only one I was really impressed by was the Steak tartare. The scallops were nice, but just average. Likewise with he Beef carpaccio-good but nothing special.This place is 100% a must do, just to admire the building itself more than anything, and the food is really good. But I think for places in the same price range, food wise you can do a bit better!",

    "text": "We'd been to MASH when it was newly opened for a Comic Relief benefit evening a couple of years ago, so we knew what to expect on our visit for my husband's birthday.While we enjoyed it the first time, it's just a bit expensive really. However, they were offering 50% off steaks in August Sunday-Thursday so we were excited to come back.The restaurant is in the basement and has loads of stairs (but there is a lift, of course). I really love the look of it - very retro American steak house. We were seated quickly by a nice waitress.We don't drink alcohol so just ordered Coke - which was mostly ice and a huge hunk of lemon.None of the starters appealed to us so we went right to mains. I had the Danish rib-eye and my husband had NY strip steak. We also had mashed potato and a caesar salad to share for our sides. Some yummy bread was brought to us while we waited.When I had ordered my steak, I asked for it medium. The waitress tried to convince me that I should get it medium rare they won't cook their dry aged beef more than medium. I persevered and said I wanted medium, but when it arrived, it was definitely medium rare - and the centre was only rare. I just ate what was a bit more cooked and left the rest, as we weren't checked on promptly enough to have the steak cooked more, and I'm also very loathe to send a steak back for more cooking as it usually gets really tough after cooking, resting, and re-cooking. Husband's NY strip was cooked as he requested.We both preferred the NY strip. My Danish ribeye had a very strong flavour and a dense texture. However, the NY strip didn't have a whole lot of flavour, really, and we should have gotten a sauce to go with it. Something in between the two would have been ideal.Our mashed potato and caesar salad were both tasty, but the mash especially was a small portion. It wasn't enough for one person, and definitely not enough for sharing. But at \u00a35 for some mash, we just each had our spoonful and didn't worry about it. Since I left most of my steak and we didn't have much in the side department, we decided to have dessert, but when the menu came, we just couldn't bring ourselves to spend \u00a310 on a panna cotta or some profiteroles.Our bill came and was around \u00a365; which seemed high, until I realised that \u00a313 of it was the optional service charge. 12.5% charged on the bill before the discount - insanity. We were there for 45 minutes. I had it removed and left a cash tip commiserate to the service we received. The waitress nearly knocked me over when we were leaving to get to the table to see how much cash we had left. I'd go back with an offer like we had, but unless you have an expense account, the premium they charge here for the location isn't quite appropriate for the food.",

    "text": "We're spoilt for choice for great steak restaurants in London but I love MASH (Modern American Steak House).I've been loads of times and the food and service has always been impeccable. The place is huge. The cloakroom is at street level when you walk in. Then you can either take the lift (yes there's a lift) or two flights of stairs into the bowels of the place. Inside the restaurant, what immediately hits you is the scale of the whole place. It's like you've walked into a scene in Titanic - a huge ballroom of 20s glitz.The impressive bar (and equally impressive bar staff) greet you immediately. It's definitely worth getting there in enough time to enjoy a cocktail. For any whiskey lovers, the selection of American Rye is among the best in London - as is the Sazerac here. Go past the bar and the huge chillers of hanging meat and the place opens up into three sections of tables and booths. There are also two private dining rooms. I've no idea how many covers this place does at capacity but it's a lot.As I've said, the food and service are impeccable. I always go for the 600g American bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and fries. It's a lot but it's all I have and is consistently cooked well.As well as U.S. beef, you can choose cuts from Uruguay, Australia, Japanese Wagyu, Danish dry-aged (the cuts hanging in the chillers) and a British ribeye.The wine list is also immense - again one of the largest selections of US wines available in London.As mentioned, we are spoilt for choice in London but MASH is up there with the best. It's great for large groups, small groups or intimate dining. I've even used the bar as a starting point for a boozy night out.",

The waiter was friendly and had a good sense of humour. Then headed to our table. Service was good and prompt. The waitress was helpful in giving advice on the best cut for us based on what we like. The dinner wine list is quite extensive but we decided to stick with the Malbec. I started with the tartare, my partner had the scallops and son had the tuna tartare. I had the American fillet which was medium rare and tender. Sides of chilli chips and spinach. Others had New York rib eye - well done and medium rare. They enjoyed it. Dessert was the key lime pie, strawberry sorbet and ice cream.",
