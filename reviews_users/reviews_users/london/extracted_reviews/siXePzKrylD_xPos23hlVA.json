    "text": "OK, maybe I'm a bit too curmudgeony for this place. The good things first: the coffee is exceptionally good. Proper coffee, \u00e0 la Dose or Flat White, and definitely needed this side of town. The brioche (and the fact that you can pork out on the Nutella) is also nice (and they give you a thick slice, as it should be. What's the point otherwise? What's the point of not using half the Nutella jar to submit said brioche to order? Really, it had to be done...)The bits I don't like? Well, it just looks a bit too pretentious to me. No doubt this will be a selling point for some, but you know, I just don't find it relaxing at all. The paninis looked a bit expensive for what they are. The outside space looks more like a shower cubicle than an outside space, and frankly, sitting at the front on the street is far more amusing than staring at a big wall. Of late, I think I can see a colonisation of this place by the panzer-sized pram community. Really... Haven't they got all Church Street to themselves?Anyway, my verdict on this is that I get my coffee and drink it either outside (it's South facing, so sunny in the morning), enjoying the 273 buses stopped in front of it, or just take it away. But as I said, it's worth going if only just for the coffee.",

I'm from Sydney, Australia (home to some of the best coffee in the world) and I have been staying in Islington for about a month. Upon arrival I hunted on Yelp for good coffee in the area and much to my disappointment, I didn't find a thing. I even ventured on the tube to London Bridge to get Monmouth which was a disappointment in itself as they didn't have soy milk.Unfortunately I only just found this place hidden behind the turning circle, opposite Highbury and Islington. I WISH I found it earlier and not 5 days before departing London as it really is the BEST coffee in the entire city.I have been here everyday since I have found it. Kim, the owner is a beautiful young Vietnamese/French born who greets you warmly as you enter the cafe and she really does have a love for the place which makes it that much more special.There is a little garden area outside and the wi-fi is free. Great music playing, fresh mint in the water jugs - the ambience is perfect...Just bliss and a welcome breath of fresh air to find a cute, boutique cafe that can actually make coffee. This is a 10 out of 10 for me. YUM!",

Recently I've noticed that in addition to the prices going up this year, the food is not as special as it used to be. In particular, the crumpets, which are a Maison staple, no longer include beetroot humous, which was what gave them the amazing bit of flavour and that extra kick that made them so much more than poached eggs and avocado on a crumpet. I've also noticed that the portions are getting a little smaller. This used to be my go to place to take my friends whenever someone wanted to try a great new brunch place but now I feel like the edge Maison used to have over other similar places is sliding, to the point where I no longer feel as excited to bring everyone I know there. The coffee is still delicious, but it would be great if Maison would spice up their menu and add some seasonal things every few weeks or months and really work on bringing back the special flavours that I adored them for.",

My favorite however is the granola with fruit and yoghurt. The decor makes me feel welcome, homely and the staff is really friendly.

Seating in the front area is tight; the backroom is like a conservatory, adds a bit of space, along with an extra touch of character and sunlight.The scones were recommended to me and I went straight for those. \u00a0I'm a sucker for all things vintage and anything that comes in mason jars so needless to say I made an effort to try all of the flavors of their homemade jams and loved all of them: a mix of gingers, rhubarbs, cinnamon, berries.... The scones themselves were delicious! \u00a0Scones preferences are subjective - some like them moist, others light or toasty. \u00a0These were perfect for me, moist and smooth (not necessarily on the light side), and certainly fresh.Scones aside, the menu offers a small selection of what you'd expect from a cozy small caf\u00e9: sandwiches, cakes, and pastries. \u00a0Fellow friends have said that other eats are hit or miss but for what it's worth, they look promising. \u00a0My flat white was solid as well.For a comforting cup of jo and scones alone, I would make the trek again. \u00a0For everything else, I'd classify it as a great neighbourhood caf\u00e9 if you happen to be in the Islington/Upper St. area.",

Flat whites with decent body, rounded and balanced with dense milk which is great.It's a small cafe with small tables perfect for one or two people and is calm and slightly urban rustic vibe, also slightly cramped for space when I come in for a coffee which is also why I take it out.Some good looking unfussy cakes, croissants and brioche adorn the counter. They have good looking chunky sandwiches too which I saw being served up to the seated punters. Next time I will have to stop for lunch.Staff are friendly and pleasant too which is always a good sign for a cafe.My local favourite coffee shop.",

Get on it please!). The coffee is strong without being too bitter, and the lattes and flat whites are rich and perfectly crafted. The only food I've ever gotten here is the scones, because I had one during my first visit and they were so good I never feel the need to order anything else. \u00a0Served with clotted cream and a choice of two types of artisanal (ugh, i hate that word, but i really do think its accurate here) jam, they are worth the trek up the hill from Clerkenwell. The staff is friendly and the customers all seem like locals. My favorite lazy sunny Sunday activity is to start the morning out with a book, a soya flat white or english breakfast tea, and aforementioned amazing scones at one of the few outdoor tables at Maison D'etre, and then meander down Upper Street popping into the shops. On a side note, this is also the first place I ever heard someone order a \"babyccino\" for their child - which, once I finished rolling my eyes so hard it hurt and Googled it I discovered is actually a \"thing\" in England - but I won't hold that against it.",

    "text": "Bruch-a-licious!My husband and I came here for some brunch (after seeing a ridiculously long line over at Sunday) We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table - which isn't too bad considering how amazing all the yelp reviews are!What we tried:- My smoothie was gorgeous and my husband liked his coffee- I had brioche with berries, bacon and maple syrup - it was good, although the brioche was much more cake-y than I am used to. It was so massive that I felt a bit sick afterwards, even though I could not quite finish it.- Marc had a croque monsieur with an egg on top and truffle oil. I am not keen on truffle oil if there is a lot of it, so I was less keen on his food. It must be good for truffle lovers though!As everything was a bit pricey, I think I'd like it more if they had an option for slightly smaller portions at a slightly reduced price. I DID like our meal here, but I don't think I'll rush back (hence 4 stars rather than 5)**I am an idiot, why not share it with yelp - cue blushes**My brioche came with honeycomb butter...which was basically a large slab of butter with lots of chunks of honeycomb. I totally forgot that this was mentioned on the menu, so took a small bite of the butter, to work out what this sweet-looking thing was. Urgh I am such a dummy. Butter on its own is not a pleasant sensation and my husband was laughing so hard at me that I tried really hard not to spit it out...but I just couldn't quite swallow it. So if you get the brioche here, that honey-tasting butter is gorgeous WHEN YOU SPREAD IT! Don't be an idiot and attempt to eat it on its own.",

We were greeted by lovely staff that made us feel welcome even though it was a busy Saturday. There are rustic wooden tables throughout, with a cozy backroom where there are tables for larger groups. There is a counter full of homemade cakes and treats, including several vegan options which I love. The menu changes often, and there were plenty of lovely sounding dishes for brunch. Including some vegetarian/vegan (but I wish there were a few more options). I had the Avocado on Sourdough, with added Halloumi. As far as avocado toast goes, this was lovely as they had added chili, lime and tomatoes which really brightened the dish. The Croque Madame with Gruyere Bechamel, Cotto Ham, Fried Egg and Truffle Oil sounds like one loaded brunch dish. It was actually not as heavy as it sounds and probably could have had a little more bechamel. The French Brioche Toast with Red Berries, Honey Syrup and Pancetta was a thing of beauty. Sweet, savoury and plenty of syrup. Nice large portion. The coffee was delicious and it is worth coming just for coffee and a piece of cake. I'm sure I will be back in the future.",

It's right by Highbury & Islington station, though across the roundabout so easy to miss. It gives me an Aussie vibe, but I'm not exactly sure of the official story. I came with a friend for brunch on the weekend without a reservation and we were seated in the back room at a sharing table with a woman dining by herself. There was also a table available in the front room, but the back room has a skylight and even on a dreary morning in London, it's nice to have natural light. We also started a conversation with the lady sharing our table, and it's really nice to be put in a position to meet new people, especially when they are from the neighbourhood!As for the food, I got a warm bowl of quinoa with a poached egg, roasted sweet potato, and avocado, and my friend got avocado on toast. The food is so good and healthy and there is actually a pretty comprehensive menu with both sweet and savory options. The coffee was great as well, and they serve tap water with mint, which was incredibly refreshing. I love this place and it's a standout for brunch options in the area, right up there with Sunday on Hemingford Road.",

It was so delicious, refreshing and healthy, the berry ice tea was just what I needed and served in kiln mason jars makes it even more authentic and quirky. Quite impressed, it's not expensive, the level of service received is outstanding. There's a back seating area with a conservatory which is also quite nice, you can sit, have a coffee and do some work. They won't try and kick you out, they actually encourage it :)",

    "text": "As a keen explorer of my local area, and after having heard so many good things about this place, I couldn't resist a visit. On my first visit, I only managed to try the coffee, as I was on the way to a meeting, but the coffee alone was superb. They serve bonsoy, which I'm told is the best soya milk and you can definitely taste the difference in the coffee. I managed to go back again this week and finally try the scones which Id been reading so much about. Wow, I'm not surprised Id read so much about them now. They were warm, homemade and crumbled as I ate them. Easily one of the best scones in London. They came with a choice of two jams - peach and rhubarb and a nice helping of clotted cream. So yummy! It's not the cheapest, which is why I didn't give it the full five stars, but it's so good, that if you're in the area, it'd be a shame not to stop by.",

I can't imagine how busy it might be in the morning as this was 5pm on a Tuesday and the place was decently full. However, I was still able to find a seat and they didnt seem to mind me doing some school work either!It is a nice place to work, but since it's quite small I felt bad taking up space for too long. The coffee is also decently priced and tasted AMAZING. In terms of straight coffee, this is probably one of the best Americanos--not too watery, but not too strong either! All around amazing!",

However, there is not much of the chai taste. Its quite creamy and milky here. So if you like a more milky and bland drink, this is the place for you!",

    "text": "I've been mildly interested in trying this place since it popped up on my radar screen some months ago, but, at the same time, thought it might be too 'oh-la-la' for my taste, if that even makes any sense. \u00a0Fortunately, a buddy of mine who works in the area was also keen on trying Maison, so, yesterday, we gave it a go. \u00a0I'm glad to say that it was a pleasant experience. \u00a0The cafe is immediately inviting. \u00a0And, with only five or six (mostly two-top) tables, it's also very cosy. \u00a0It was the perfect respite to the grey and drizzly day outside. \u00a0If the tables are full, there's a groovy bench at the front for those who wish to both watch the world and the #271 bus go by. \u00a0 The flat whites (I drank two) were creamy, not too hot, and made in the style of places I've come to appreciate in this town like Prufrock's and Kaffeine. \u00a0The pastries looked tasty and the scones were massive. \u00a0My friend, hungry for more than a biscuit, had a rather yummy-looking aubergine sandwich with a bit of rocket on the side. \u00a0Interestingly, the outer side of the bread was drizzled with olive oil which probably only made it taste better. \u00a0I declined a bite and the sandwich was gone within minutes! \u00a0Your English Nan's china may have been used for serving the lunch fare and cups and saucers a la Foxcroft and Ginger hung below a shelf on the wall behind the counter. \u00a0I was hoping for my flat white to be in an English Rose cup, but alas it wasn't. \u00a0Mayhap the chinaware is reserved for tea?Bonus: sat *this close* to a fab character actor whom I recently had the pleasure of watching in 'Tinker Tailor...'. \u00a0Like always, I played it cool.",

I've been here since the morning, started off with a scone with clotted cream and a very delicious black currant and pear jam as well as a tasty latte (not too sweet, just how I like it!) and had a fantastic sandwich for lunch later.The place is very cute with rustic tables and decorations. There's a second room at the back for some more seating, but it does get quite crowded as it seems to be a very popular spot.The staff is very friendly and efficient and I really enjoyed my time here. Their wi-fi is also very reliable, which is a huge factor for me.Will definitely be coming back here!",
