While we waited though it was mouthwatering watching the delicious dishes, salads and special meat platters being prepared right in front of our eyes. We were seated round the back with some lovely traditional Turkish style decor, but it would have been preferable to have a table in the front. Food was delicious and ready quickly, and you have to try the lamb chops - wow! I'll be going back soon!",

    "text": "Went to this bustling and excellent Turkish restaurant and takeaway on Harringay's Grand Parade with a group of 7 last Friday. It was absolutely full, which is generally a good sign, but within three minutes we had been found a table. As with most of the Turkish places in Harringay, the resto has a big charcoal trough at the front, over which shish kebabs are cooked, and two vertical spits with chicken and lamb doner. Lest anyone be thinking of the grey elephant leg which passes for doner in most chipshops nationwide, nothing could be further from the truth. Proper doner is made from marinated offcuts of lamb layered with fatty lamb tail. This melts as the spit rotates and runs through the meat, basting it into delicious tenderness. We had mixed meze to start with. Tons of piping-hot pillow-bread to dunk into potato salad, taramasalata, spinach with yoghurt, hummus and tomato and runnerbean dips. Most of us chose to follow up with one of the various shish options - from darkly spiced kofte (minced kebab) to tender marinaded lamb cubes - all cooked over charcoal. I had mixed doner, chicken and lamb mounded on top of stock-cooked rice, and a couple of us went for the Yoghurtlu kebabs - shish piled on chopped bread, soaked in sauce and topped with warm Turkish yoghurt. More bread kept on coming, along with a couple of brightly coloured plates of salad, and we washed the whole thing down with some bottles of Efes beer. The restaurant, obviously delighted to have a table of 7 in, laid on some complementary rice pudding for dessert. Although this sounds a bit like school dinners, it was sweet, vanilla-y and actually quite pleasant. We were stuffed by the time the bill arrived, and very happy to split the \u00a3100 (including tip) that our three course meal for 7 with drinks cost. Let me just repeat that. 3 course meal for 7 with drinks. \u00a3100. Amazing. G\u00f6ky\u00fcz\u00fc, for anyone who is interested, means heaven in Turkish. Which, if they continue to serve food like this, is about right.",

Unfortunately, it appears that the management put on a bit of a show following the refurbishment and have now slipped back to slapdash practices. On a recent visit, the service was poor and slow; several requests for drinks were either ignored or fulfilled halfway through the meal. The 'special mix grill' ' (\u00a319) we ordered was supposed to contain such delicacies as lamb cutlets and quail. What arrived was a large plate consisting mainly of chicken wings and diced doner-kebab on a bed of rice! When this was pointed out to the waiter, he simply shrugged his shoulders! Furthermore, you get stung \u00a33 for a small bottle of beer, and you can forget about the complimentary desserts and coffee they used to give - it's all gone by the wayside! It's all beginning to feel rather cynical.... Yes, it's sort of cheap, but I am afraid what you get is pretty poor.Better to try 'Hala Restaurant' a few doors away. At least you get a very decent meal and none of the aggravation.",

We went just after it was refurbished several months ago, with a group of about 8. That time, half of the party turned up 20 minutes after the rest, and the staff didn't bat an eyelid as they sorted out extra seating and places for us all, taking our orders without rushing us but happily offering recommendations all of which were served up fairly quickly, clearly made fresh and with great flavours. This time was even better - a group of 3, we turned up to find the queue out the door but the staff very friendly and efficient as they took our names, and found us a table in under 10 minutes (after warning us it might take up to 15). Friendly family atmosphere, a lot of tables groaning under massive mixed platters (I'm definitely ordering one of those next time!) Unlimited pita bread and salad to share (very simple but very well done, with a great dressing) made us pretty happy. I had the lamb ribs - juicy with just the right amount of fat sizzling around the edges, served with fabulous rice. My friend had the lamb shish which she enjoyed very much, and even a vegetarian friend was accommodated with the mixed mezze platter. Wait staff were quick on the mark when we were looking for them, but didn't hover, and everyone around us seemed to be really enjoying themselves. All in all, one of the best eating experiences I've had locally, we're planning to make it a regular fixture.",

Always expect queues, no matter what time it is, although we never waited for more than 5 minutes. The meat platters are massive, so think again before ordering that jumbo size. The smaller one is supposedly for 1-2 person(s) but it can easily feed up to four (especially if you order starters). IMHO their lahmacun is slightly average (definitely not bad, just nothing special), but the chicken beyti is indeed exceptional. I wouldn't go anywhere else for Turkish food in London.",

This place still doesn't disappoint and packs amazing flavour in all their dishes. You get a salad and bread free as standard when you order any kebabs. The portion sizes are ridiculously huge and if you're in a group you can even get large platters that are 3-4 but does actually feed 5-6. The best bit has to be that they dab the bread over the meat to soak up more of the deliciously meaty goodness, maybe avoid if you're a veggie. The only downside is that as its popularity has grown, so has its prices (slightly) and their bottles of homemade garlic and chilli sauces seem to be more commercial and I see this expanding into a nandos type chain. I hope this doesn't happen and it keeps it uniqueness through its growth. (Visit - 12/03/2015 Lunch)",

We also got some patlican soslu which is aubergine and green peppers in a tomatoey sauce, some bulgur wheat and lahmacun which is a kind of Turkish pizza.It was absolutely buzzing on Saturday night and it's certainly had a refurb in recent times. Half of the space is a restaurant and the other half is for takeaway, both sides were busy and there seemed to be a lot of Turkish people in there - always a good sign of authentic cuisine!The wrap was all kinds of delicious and what made is stand out for me was the chunks of cucumber here and there which were so cooling against the chilli sauce and gave the wrap a good bite.All of the dishes were as tasty as they looked and smelt, no wonder this place is so busy - really great Turkish cuisine, I'll definitely be back to try some more dishes (just don't tell Durum or Kilim!!)",

    "text": "This Turkish restaurant is located on the main street (Green Lanes), parking can be an issue, especially with the super efficient traffic wardens and the CCTV cameras! The restaurant does not look like much from the outside, but boy the food is simply delicious, it makes one of the best lahmacun i ever tried. For main we ordered a mix grill, when it arrived it was just so enticing, it consisted of meat & chicken cubes, kofte, chicken wings, etc. The quantity was enough for 3, it comes with salad & home made bread with a yogurt & cucumber sauce. Its was lovely, succulent and tasty.The service is great, really had a nice evening meal with the family. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Their website is gokyuzurestaurant.co.uk",

    "text": "Gokyuzu has undergone a makeover in recent months, taking over the neighbouring premises and modernising their decor and installing plain wooden furniture. Although popular for Saturday lunch, we were soon seated and orders were taken and completed quickly. Starting with a meze comprising four dishes including houmous, aubergine, and a creamy mix called haydari, only the prawn dish was a little under par. The children had chicken shish served with rice and salad which was eaten with gusto, a good sign, and hubby had a chicken dish which resembled a wrap chopped into slices which he said was good. My lamb shish was nice but could have been a little more tender perhaps. Too full to attempt desserts, but we did order some salty, frothy ayrans which went down quickly. Meal for 4 (no alcohol) was \u00a330 and we hardly needed to eat for the rest of the day. Very family friendly, highchairs available",

I've eaten in many Turkish restaurants, both here and in Istanbul, and this place is one of my favourites. when I first saw it I thought it was one of those cheap, awful food places, hunger drove me in and it was fantastic. It's never empty and sometimes you have to Que to get a table. The food is super and what I like about it the most is they offer you a free selection of Mezes and flat bread before you even order. Every time I'm in London I eat here. Even if I have to go out of my way and sit in that traffic.",

Would order again.Babaganush - This was one that was okay... it was a little creamy for me, I and my dining partners prefer more aubergine heavy BBG. \u00a0Would skip next time.Hellim - this grilled halloumi was to die for. \u00a0It came out hot and melty (in as much as halloumi could be melty). Would definitely order again.Muska Boregi - this was an off the cuff order, but was delicious! Would definitely order again.Mains:Chicken Wings - flavourful and moist. \u00a0Some people wanted sauce (which we got - spicy and mint), but I thought these were delicious without. \u00a0Would order again.Adana Kebab - this is my all time favourite turkish dish. \u00a0I can't say its the best minced lamb kebab I've ever had, but it was good. Spiced well and moist. \u00a0Would order again.Sea Bass - this was definitely the star of the night. It was moist and pulled right off the bone (heads up as it comes as a whole fish!). \u00a0The spice/chutney on top were amazing and complemented, but did not over power the fish itself. \u00a0A few complaints about bones, but really they were pretty easy to avoid/spot as you chew and is a side effect of whole fish plates! I would definitely order this again!",

The salad they provide is delicious and they also give you their yogurt and cucumber dip along with delicious home baked flat bread..ALL DELICIOUS already. Next the appetizers, the Baba ghanough was one of my favorite starters-it was so perfectly made and balanced, different and better than what I'm used to. The fried halloumi is fried cheese...def a win-I love halloumi cheese! The feta and melon was good; the feta is a mild feta cheese (which I actually liked). \u00a0We were already pretty full here, but then our orders came. We ordered the iskandar kabob, Adana kabob, and chicken doner...everyone was happy and ate almost all of their food (and there is a lot of food) We couldn't resist ordering dessert, considering how delicious the food was...it was a must! And WOW.....it's a must. The kunafa-#1 top kunafa I've ever had...served with cream/butter that is exceptionally tasty with the kunafa! The rice pudding-#2 favorite and delicious! Not too sweet, slight hint of rosewAter...tasty!The cheesecake-#3-fresh pomegranate on top of delicious not too sweet cheese. This was my sisters favorite. \u00a0She claimed it was one of the most unique and delicious cheesecakes she has ever had!The baklava:#4 the pistachios in the baklava were so delicious, but this wasn't our favorite balaclava ever!

This place is casual but clean with an airy feel.Service is just okay...our server was a bit impatient but this could have been a language barrier on both sides?Food was good and not-so-good.-- Salad was delicious. Loved everything about it. -- Lamb kabob was excellent according to my 10-year-old who devoured it.-- Vegetable stew wasn't really a stew at all but just dried mixed vegetables accompanied by rice. I didn't enjoy this much.-- Chicken kabob was undercooked - my husband had to send it back for additional cooking. Overall Gokyuzu was just okay for us. Since we're in the minority it could be that we just didn't order right? So if we're in the area we might give it another go.",

The missus and I were broadly down with this, figuring this was just customary for the restaurant; and we assumed that we would be charged for it at the end of the meal. We were incorrect. These two starters, both of which were great and far beyond anything I have ever had in the 'free starter' department.The mains (lamb grill for me, chicken soup for her) were both good, tasty and hearty. Generous portions, very good value.The service was attentive and matter-of-fact. I don't need servers to be my buddy - I prefer it when they are effective, and these folks definitely were. Attentive without being overbearing, and friendly enough so that I never felt like I was an imposition. It's hard to strike this balance, and the servers here did it well.The restaurant itself is reasonably large but it doesn't feel cavernous or anything, and the servers manage the space efficiently. On our visit, it was busy but we were seated quickly nonetheless. It's not a fancy setup, but it's all clean and light and quite comfortable. The clientele ranged broadly in terms of demographics, from teenagers to pensioners, families with their children, couples, groups of friends, many different races and ethnicities. Great to see so many people getting down with Turkish food.This place was excellent from top to bottom. Great food, excellent service and unbelievable value. I would highly recommend a visit.",

I could have inhaled the whole round plate, with dollops of olive oil and warm pita bread, but had to restrain myself. I also hot the halloumi pide with a sprinkling of red peppers (they were a bit stingy there, as more red peppers would have been good). Melted halloumi+ warm bread= winning.My husband got a lamb dish which was similarly enormous and he said quite flavorful.I got the house Turkish wine and it was bland, bland, but no fault of the restaurant. For two people, an app, two main dishes, a wine and diet coke (with leftovers to boot) for 51 quid was a steal. We would happily return and bring others!",

Underneath that in the greens, the slivered cabbage and the cucumbers were 20 to 25 fantastic olives - more than one gets in a dish of olives in some spanish restaurants.Lamb soup was simple hardy stuff - fine as it was straight from the kitchen - and even better when doctored with the generous array of condiments provided on the table. (A great Turkish hot sauce and a nice strong sumac powder were available and welcome.) Note - lamb soup without a drop of grease - a sign of attention in the cooking.Vegetable stew had strong tastes on each of the ingredients and every vegetable had its own flavor.(How many ratatouille variants have you had of eggplant/marrow/tomato/basil mush all cooked together to the point of being practically bolognese sauce?)Mint tea with about triple the mint leaves you get in some other places.And even though the lines to get in are humongous - the service never rushes anyone - and attentively offers you all sorts of goodies like a good host.This place is highly popular and that popularity is well deserved.",

Kebab dish that we ordered was pretty good, so were the mezes (arnavut cigeri bir harika!) but Lahmacun was the highlight of the dinner. It has the perfect blend of spices and crust, absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!",

Most men love it, as the meet is a hill on your plate, but all the meet tasted like the thing you light the charcoal with.... all the same white spirits taste.Still very good are the daily stews. This I recommend. If you come: there might be a long queue on the weekend and some evenings! But try yourself.Or stick to their veg and stew.Or go to Antepiler next door for a truly awesome and cheap fresh crunchy tasty Lahmacun :)",

    "text": "This is my top 5 place in London. If you read other reviews you'll already know why but here's a few pointers.- Turkish food gives HUGE portions. - Get the platter if in a group. The meat platter gives you every charcoal meat you can think of (doner, shish, ribs, wings, small pieces) along with a few peppers and some amazing rice. I honestly would take the hard work of looking through single dishes on menu and just get this. - The free salads and bread that come with the platter are exceptional. Turkish salad is great on it's own to be honest. - The starter mezes are lovely.- The free tea. Ah unlimited free tea. Just ask. - The service. They like most Turks are renowned for customer service.- Sometimes you even get free Baklava.- It's a buzzing place and is always packed. But this adds to the experience.- You can take away your food in a doggy bag. Meaning GET THE PLATTER. Then save some for the next day. It's just too good!Gokyuzu for me is THE place to go to on Green Lanes. The hub of a Turkish community where you will find many great restaurants in fact (Hala, Antepliler, Diyabakir). But Gokyuzu is the most popular for good reason. Come hungry and if you like tasty meat and the meat sweats that will come with it. Come here.",
