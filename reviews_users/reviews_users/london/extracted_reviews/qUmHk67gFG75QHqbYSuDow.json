It is just one of them places that really seems to speak for itself, the lighting as you go in is dull and just already seems to give it that really unwelcoming invitation. It is overpriced and the food is really horrible. The oval circualar shaped middle room opens it out and it is one part of this pub i don't actually mind. But i really don't ever see me going back even when i do pop in to greenwich. Again the ''early ushering in'' has also been noticed by myself and obviously others on here. Definately makes me angry as i'm a smoker and lets face it, i've already been pushed outside.i expect to be able to sit down in a area designated yet the gypsy moth just seems to ignore this and penalise the smokers and the other people enjoying the outdoors are made to come in as well. Bit of a joke really as i wouldn't expect my girlfriend to go outside onto the street of a night on her own to go for a smoke, and that obviously what other people are having to do..I just think its wrong.",

Roast meat with all the trimmings for under a tenner - significantly under in fact, at \u00a38.90. \u00a0There is a beer garden which is very nice in the summertime, perfect for relaxing with some Pimms or a delicious cocktail. I've never tried the beers here but its the usual big brewery suspects, I'm afraid. One thing I wish they would change is the music - bad lounge music seems to almost always be playing! Its quite popular too, so be prepared to wait for a table.",

These plusses are what saved it from a one star review from me. A pub by the river with a garden should really have more than one person serving on the bar on a hot sunny day. This led to a painfully slow wait for a pint of Brain's bitter that in the end was not worth itthe beer was not in good condition, unless it was meant to taste like vinegar in which case I apologise. The pub was very busy but somehow territory was annexed in the beer garden. Normally when you get a prime place in such a beer garden you don't really want to give it up but the prospect of a long wait for another pint of vinegary swill was the deciding factor in leaving after just the one drink.",

With a pretty garden out the back, it's a great place to go on a sunny day for a spritzer and nibbles with friends. That's if you can get a seat. You see, the Gipsy Moth has always been heaving whenever I've been there, and on each occasion I've only just managed to nab the last table, whether that be outside or inside. Outside is infinitely preferable, as the interior - although tasfefully decorated - is really rather dark. Not as dark as the ladies loos though, which are almost pitch black. Yes, the service at the bar could be quicker, but I was recently impressed when - on a packed bank holiday weekend afternoon - they served us our sharing food platter within about 30minutes. Worth a trip, but - be warned - you're well and truly on the tourist trail here.",

I'm not really impressed with the decor It seems like they've tried to keep up with the times but unsuccessfully, luckily they have plenty of comfy sofas and chairs! So can you rest your legs from all the plodding around Greenwich you've done with your shopping bags! :DWhat makes this a gem of a place is that you wouldn't of expected it to have such a large beer garden from what looks like a narrow part of Greenwich! They even have an area where they have outdoor heaters to keep you cozy n warm if you brave it out in the cold to get away from the stuffy air inside when it's too full and busy.I've only been here for drinks and haven't had the opportunity to eat there yet but will update this review when i do. They serve the regular pub food menu, changing specials and Sunday roast!On the negative side service can be slow and it does get quite busy towards the weekend so good idea to go mid week when its quieter or before the evening kicks in as it can get pretty packed on Fri and sat.Overall this place is great to meet up with friends or just relax with your partner as it has an unpretentious atmosphere and a wonder full beer garden to lounge around in the summer time.",

Plenty of seating is available but it does get busy so you will need to keep your eyes out for an opening outside. Inside is nice too with a selection of sofas, small tables for conversation and larger ones designed to cater for groups. The bar staff are polite and will talk to you if you engage them in conversation. They also acknowledge you if there's a queue and if there is some sort of problem with service they will sort it to the best of their abilities. Price wise I found it to be a little more expensive than your average pub but for fashionable places like this you have to expect that. I had a disappointing experience with some potato wedges which I did not feel were value for money due to the quantity of food but lesson learnt, I won't be ordering food again in a hurry.It may also interest some people to know that there is no big screen at the Gipsy Moth and it therefore provides a safe haven for those not into football and other sports.",

However, the night was ruined by music played so loud you literally could not have a conversation! We had to shout at the top of our voices just to get the person right next to yo yo hear! We gave up, it was just no fun and left to go home and watch the new year on TV rung in. Today, it being lovely, we decided yo go to the gypsy moth for lunch. We were surprised to get a table easily with the pub not too busy. After getting a drink we waited a good 20 minutes for someone to take our food order and then was told it would be at least an hour wait! What? The table next to us were complaining of having to wait ages fifty there food and had seen their dishes sitting on the pass for over 10 minutes. We finished up our drinks and left.",

The beer garden is pretty great, especially if you get a table in the sun but it's full of horrible rude people who think they're cooler than everyone else. Despite the fact that they're still students. Louise is right, the beer is always off - except the most expensive. You can pay nearly four quid for a pint in here. It cost my five quid for a vodka and orange and they poured the orange juice out of the same cartoons they use in Wetherspoons. Maybe they walked to Russia to get the vodka or something. It's a shame that this place has such an attitude. It's a nice looking pub. Tourists seem to like it and you'll often get people telling you they've been in on a recent trip to Greenwich. Aside from students and tourists, who else goes in here? I've never noticed the staff to be particularly rude, but they're not exactly pleasant either. The food is too expensive for me too. All this said, as I haven't been in a while it might have changed - it could be brilliant now for all I know. I'm not exactly keen to go back, but I MIGHT just do it just for Qype",

Gypsy Moth is one of those very first places I've visited in Greenwich and it could be the name that you often hear due to its fame.

It has a small lovely garden at the back but it would be easier to win a lotto than to grab a seat there - never mind. Last time I was there, my friend took his bike into the garden, suddenly someone who seemed to be some sort of management told him off.

It is probably one of the busiest pubs I have ever been to, and I doubt that's because the food, drink and service is bad. The only thing I could really say that is bad about the place is how busy it gets - it makes it quite uncomfortable, but there are many other bars in the area if this gets too much for people. I've often moved to another bar to find about 15 people there, compared to a full bar at the Gypsy. It may be a little expensive, but it's in the heart of Greenwich so I don't expect it to be cheap. The beer is good, but I've not tried the food. It's definitely nice to sit out in the beer garden on a Sunny day - just expect it to take a while to get served and to find a seat.",

The Beer is usually off and you have to keep picking something else. The wine i had was appauling and had no nice taste to it one little bit. When i asked for maybe a different bottle, as they had in fact reccommended it, i was told no. They obviously wanted to get rid of some unselling stock and so they reccommended it. As a publican myself i was disgusted that they obviously found this ok to do.The food i have also tried here and it was nasty. Cold and over cooked so i'm not even sure how they managed it.Seriously the chicken i had was dry yet cold so it must have sat on a pass while cooling down ready and waiting to come out to me.The service here was absolutely diabolical. I don't use that word often so when i do, i know i really had a bad time. I was sat somewhere near the back once when you could still smoke inside and me and four other friends were sat having a smoke when this guy who appeared to come from the kitchen who arrupted with shouting at us that we could not smoke there?!? There were ashtrays on the tables, which were infact dirty and hadn't been cleaned all night, plus ashtrays on the tables all in this section. Sowe moved. Apparently not quick enough. He then started shouting at us that either we moved or got out. Bare in mind i'm already up and have my belongings in my arms ready to move to another table.It is safe to say that when i pointed out that there were ashtrays on all of the tables, plus no signs up saying 'no smoking' and i really do mean none, he didn't actually want to know, said that it wasn't his problem and that we were to move at once. (well actually it was a problem obviously otherwise he wouldn't of kicked off in the first place!)Maybe just maybe he should've actually asked his staff who had putt them out in this area?It obviously didn't make any difference to him and he obviously enjoyed this and maybe saw it as part of a game as he retired back to his kitchen and left the ashtrays there.....Funnily enough some other people sat there and recieved the same treatment. I felt like getting up and saying something but was told not to by my friends. I wish i had but never mind.PLEASE please bare in mind i have been here just the once and all this happened in the same evening!",

Historic fact: The Gipsy Moth was the name of the boat in which Sir Francis Chichester sailed s around the world was once moored nearby. The Pub is named after this historic and renown boat. They make classic British fare. My daughter and I got a sausage smashed potatoes. The sausages were super yummy and potatoes were light and airy. My son got a hamburger that he loved and said was absolutely tasty and filling. My husband got the fish and chips. He said the fish and chips were superb and filled him up.Loved the British Pub ambiance and the kindness of the waitstaff. The guys at the bar portion of the pub let us sample their brews on tap as well as their cider. I got the cider and shared with my daughter. My husband got one of their on tap brews. Thanks so much to the bartenders and waitstaff for being so friendly!!",

It has a truly unique feel, halfway between an open-air bistro and a traditional pub. Once seated, we took a half second to look at the menu and ordered at the bar: a scotch egg to share (it was huge, warm, and very flavorful), the roast plate each (could easily have shared one - it was a lot of meat and the Yorkshire pudding was about 7\" diameter), and a toffee dessert thing that was rich but light but sweet but savory but OMG we ate the whole thing. They also did a brilliant job pacing the meal - I hate being rushed through courses and was able to enjoy all three.LOTS of bathrooms upstairs, so you're never waiting (nice!), Wifi (nice!), and comfy seats. After we finished, we moved from the dining room (all 4-tops so we felt guilty taking up space) to the front bar area to wait for our friend and enjoyed more cocktails.",

    "text": "As another Yelper points out - the pub is a short walk from the pier, right by the Cutty Sark (a dry docked sailing ship/museum), and convenient to the train stop. We stopped here after a day at the observatory. They have a large outdoor patio, a separate bar area inside, as well as a dining room. They did not have table service. You ordered drinks and food at the bar and a runner brought them to the table.Typical pub fare. My wife had the fish and chips and I had the sausages and mash. The fish and chips were good, but I thought the sausages were excellent. Reasonable beer selection.The pub had regular traffic of what looked to be a mix of locals and tourists.",

But my 3 friends were very unimpressed - and I Yelp for the group :( I had the fish and chips and it was really really good! Sabie had the chicken salad and asked for dressing on the side - it was not. Other members of the group all wanted items that were not available - multiple items were not available... I guess I got lucky ? Ambiance was good... We were seated relatively quickly ... So personally I don't have any complaints... But much like the Thai place I got food poisoning at and everyone else loved (they got 2 stars) I have to judge this based on the group experience",

Yea, the music was loud and made it hard to converse and you have to shout but I suppose if the weather is good and there's space in the garden, it's going to be real nice! On to the food, the onion rings was proper onion rings (if you get what I mean) and fish and chips was good! The batter was light and crispy and fish was fresh. Drinks are on the average London price range but it's cutty sark so you get the gist!",

Yes. Do they have decent food? Yes -- standard gastro-pubby type fare, burgers, steaks, fish and chips, pies, etc. I've eaten here a few times and it's all good but nothing knock out. A few of us even dined here on Christmas Day recently (as it was one of the few local places open), and I would \u00a0recommend it. \u00a0The staff were particularly cheery and service was good. \u00a0The mulled wine was delicious and potent.Generally, I think it's best to visit in Summer for the outside garden, or if you happen to be in the area, with people from out of town for the tourist location-wow factor.",

There was a table that was reserved for someone else, but was free to use until 3 PM. So we sat down. We ordered our food by the bar (because it seems that in pubs, people drink more than eat, and so the establishments can't keep track of what gets ordered, so they let the customers do the work for them by telling them to order at the bar). I find it surprising that it took them almost 45 minutes to deliver our food. Yes, I was watching my watch, after all, we only had the table until 3 PM. And when the food arrived, sorry, but I was not appeased. The burger (which I ordered with pulled pork) wasn't juicy at all, and the meat didn't taste palatable. I definitely have had better burgers than here. I suppose I can note that their fish and chips were not as greasy as the other one I tried in a different establishment. Needless to say, this place reinforces the stereotype that British pub food sucks. I would only come back here if all I want is a drink, and I want to drink it while gazing at the Cutty Sark.",
