Get the combo meal, it is plenty big for a meal and a solid value at 5 pds, with soft drink.Ketchup, tartar sauce etc will run you between 20 and 60 pence per pouch, which is insane. Also, be sure to check your order, because the counter woman has a tendency to \"forget\" to ad extras in. She will greet you with an Asian accented \"You here for some fish, big boy?\" that is worth a quid on its own.Ive only visited the a la carte side, the sit down looks to be a proper rip off.",

I was so excited to see Yelp in London and even more so when I found this fish & chips place right around the corner of my hotel! The place looks very cute - there's a sit-down restaurant side and a fast-food counter where you can get some grub to go. We had to drag our luggage with us since our hotel was charging an arm and a leg to hold our bags for us and the hostess was nice enough to allow us to bring it to the restaurant. We had the lunch special - fish and chips (along with a side of green peas and white untoasted bread) with tea and dessert. It was . . . just okay. The fish was fried nicely and not too oily - I dunno what I was expecting out of it, but it tasted like something I could get in the States. Nothing out of this world. Blimey!",

    "text": "Found this fish & chips shop when looking for a nice bite near Victoria train station. Was excited by the yelp reviews, but upon sitting down in the restaurant realized that the dine-in prices were WAY higher than for take out. Was ready to spend 7 or 8 quid on fish & chips and when I sat down and read the menu, I realized it was going to set me back about \u00a313! This is a huge difference and I would almost certainly order at the counter and take out next time. They even have a few stools and a narrow table along the front window where you can eat your take out.Happy to enjoy full table service, I decided on the Fish & Chips set menu: a medium cod or haddock, chips, peas, and bread and butter for \u00a312.90. Not too bad. Plus it came with fruit or 2 scoops of ice cream and coffee or tea. Pretty good value and loads of food!I tried the haddock and a friend got the cod. We both got the same set menu, so it was strange when the plates came out and the haddock was almost twice the size as the cod. That being said, the cod definitely tasted better, with a nice flaky texture. The haddock was just bland and needed tons of salt to taste like anything at all. Even with the smaller piece of cod, it was enough food to fill your belly.Service was very good and friendly. 10% service change was automatically added to the bill.Next time, I'll order the cod and get it to go!",

    "text": "We arrived before 5PM on a Sunday evening. The greeter was very nice, and we were able to pick our table because other dinners hadn't arrived. It is an average sized restaurant with simple wooded table and chairs. It seemed very clean and you could see partially into the kitchen and that they were very good about washing their hands. \u00a0There is a \"set menu\" of 2 or 3 courses included that can save you a bit of money over ordering al'a carte. When we ordered there was considerable difficulty communicating with the waitress, there was a definite language issue, and I'm not sure what her first language was but she had difficulty understanding me and vice versa. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I wasn't sure what would arrive at the table but it was close to what I tried to ask for, not sure why it was complicated, it just seemed like neither of us was sure that the other meant. \u00a0One item that was ordered was a prawn salad, which arrived as mostly lettuce with tiny prawns to give it a sense of being legitimate, but far too much Thousand Island dressing, it should have been on the side, but I think it was an effort to hide the parsimonious amount of shrimp. \u00a0The main dish was generous on the other items however and the fish (Halibut and Cod) were perfect.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However my husband did not order the batter covered style but we both got that in the end. \u00a0Who knows where communications broke down. \u00a0The peas seemed fresh and the chips were maybe a tad undercooked, but nothing terrible. \u00a0The staff is extremely friendly and check on you, but you are reluctant to say much because who knows what they will assume. \u00a0My husband asked for a glass of water and I swear I thought the waiter repeated \"Hot Water?\" but he did actually get a glass of water. \u00a0We asked for tea and got a ready made cup of milky tea. \u00a0It was fine but I thought it unusual to not be asked if we wanted milk (I didn't, but I drank it because it wasn't worth trying to explain). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another couple came in and seemed very familiar with the staff and was treated with great attention and consideration, their extended family arrived shortly, their daughter and two grandsons, about 4 and 3. \u00a0They knew the staff and were happy to see them. \u00a0It was impressive how kind the staff were. \u00a0However the kids were raucous to the point of being a disruption and I realized that they cater to families, so I wouldn't take a new date there, generally speaking. \u00a0I think it was a reasonable meal, but for me, without children of a certain age, I wouldn't go there except for take away.",

THE GOOD: Very pleasant staff, cordial and niceI was greeted straight away, no 'tude no krazee eyes Had so much hope for the place, thought it would be fly But I felt like my trip was a waste of time. THE BAD: Looked at the menu and ordered the number one Cod and chips with bread and a drink of choice, done and done. Looked at the eat in prices and nearly tripped my wallet imploded, bank account exploded and I did a backflip THE UGLY: I was starving, but took it to goBegan dining immediately when I reached homeBut sadly nothing could save this grand fish dishIt could not be resuscitated, limp, lifeless, tastelessand boy, oh boy i hate to say it, but felt like I was chewing on a rubber toy.and in it, I found three bones!Terrified, I screamed like that kid in the scene of Home AloneMy bread was okay, it was pre-butteredFor which I am grateful, I'm no diet nutter The fries tasted processed instead of fresh cutTo save them, a hearty dumping of ketchup. I know I'm outta line. But the best part of my meal was the Heinz.",

The standard cod or whatever and chips is decent enough, but a bit pricy compared to a more basic chippie where the quality may be as good or better. The upside is you can get a decent glass of wine with your meal, and the value seems to improve as you progress up the menu. Best choice in my view is the skate, either grilled or fried it's a good value option.Generally this place is good but it's not one of the best in town.",

The service was great and I felt well cared for which isn't always the case when you're dining alone. \u00a0I started with the prawn avocado appetizer which was very bland (with rose marie sauce which as I suspected is a mix of mayo and ketchup) but the shrimp were good. Then I had the crab linguine special and mushy peas (since those seem to be a thing). The linguine was OK and crab wasn't that flavorful. As for mushy peas, they tasted OK, but I think you must have to be raised with those to really crave them plus the side portion was HUGE, especially for \u00a32.80. I did have a lovely cup of tea so that was good. Maybe I would have been better off going with fried dishes.",

Martha sat us down and I must say, she surprised us with a smile and friendly service. We had been in london for 4 days by this point and each restaurant we went to received us with scowls and unfriendliness. Martha was very nice. Throughout our meal, she checked in to make sure we were enjoying our food without being too overbearing. I don't don't what to say but that Martha redeemed all of London for us! Now, let's talk about the food. I had salmon with a side of salad. Very good. My dining partner had tried the fish and chips at a different restaurants the other day but was quite disappointed. This time, he decided to try a different kind of fish--kind of an alternative to fish and chips. He ordered the deep fried scampi. It was delicious! We also ordered the Mediterranean Serving Platter for our appetizer (they call it a starter in England). That was delicious, too!All in all, I had a pleasurable experience. Well, to say that it was just \"pleasurable\" doesn't do it justice. The food was excellent and Martha's service was exquisite. If you go and Martha is working, you will receive the best night of your life! It's the professionalism and care that she puts into her job that truly made the night for us.",

    "text": "First time this American enjoyed a proper fish and chips while visiting London and we really enjoyed. The batter was so light and crispy; the cod was fluffy and dense as it should be. Nice flavor overall. Great portion. My husband had the ginormous order of plaice (flounder) and loved every bite he could handle. I forgot to mention our starter - calamari. Really fresh serving of calamari with the same crispy batter and amazing tartar sauce. We loved it all!! The best part of our visit? The service. Loved chatting it up with the guys there asking about the area, London food, etc. So glad our Air BNB host suggested this spot!",

    "text": "Mediocre service and food. \u00a0We ate here our last night in the UK expecting to get a really good meal and finish our trip with great British service. \u00a0It never happened. \u00a0The server barely understood English, which seems to be a reoccurring theme in England (this is not good irony when trying to get proper answers before ordering). \u00a0She couldn't understand nor answer our questions about the specials, and which wines paired well with them. \u00a0The manager or owner (he never identified himself) came out and then somewhat curtly responded to our questions. \u00a0After that, we waited and waited for service (I think the [only] wait staff there was afraid to approach us again). \u00a0Finally, the owner/manager noticed us staring at them for service, and (they) took our order. When the food arrived, it was mediocre- the fish and chips were somewhat chewy (too battered). \u00a0My salad wasn't very good (brown lettuce) and over-priced scallops weren't the freshest- geeze, this is England, where the most furthest point inland is 70 miles- why is it so hard to find fresh seafood?? \u00a0The asparagus side was properly done, but that and the wine recommendation were the only good things I can remember from this eatery, as we left after paying a hefty bill and feeling a bit let-down about our experience.",
