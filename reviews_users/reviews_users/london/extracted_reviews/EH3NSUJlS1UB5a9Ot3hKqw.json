That's not a word, I know. But Masala Zone makes u fuse words just coz their food is that good. Went with my darling aunt and we had a wonderfully satisfying meal. Nothing like spicy Indian food in dreary London weather. This place is always busy so don't expect booths or a romantic ambience. I don't even think they have booths. That's ok. The food makes up for it. The line moves pretty fast so you'll be seated pretty quick. Had the assorted tandoori and biryani and butter chicken and sweet and mango lassi. Divine. No, really, divine. Loved it so much, we trudged in the rain on 2 separate occasions to stuff our face with some good food. Will be a staple if i ever return to London!",

    "text": "I've got really mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, it's awesomely decorated, the prices are REALLY good for London/Covent Garden and some of the dishes are completely delicious. However there are just so many strange little niggly things that all add up to make eating here an oddly frustrating experience. Firstly, when my boyfriend popped in to enquire about booking a table for Saturday, he was told they didn't take bookings. However when we turned up to find a queue at the door, we were asked if we had a reservation! So apparently you can book? Then when my friend asked if she could have a certain curry with chicken instead of prawn, she was told they couldn't substitute. And when she asked for a different curry to be made mild, she was told they couldn't alter the strength. Since they supposedly cook everything fresh from scratch, why? Hmm. My enquiry about whether the peshwari naan has sultanas in (hate them!) was answered in the affirmative, yet when my friend's peshwari turned up (after a long wait - they'd forgotten it), there were none in there... so I missed out for no reason. I asked for poppadoms, but they can ONLY be ordered in a batch of four, and since no-one else wanted any and I didn't fancy eating that many, I had to go without. Finally, our food was all pretty lukewarm when it turned up.It's a shame really, because the thalis here are pretty special, and the food is much healthier than your standard curry house - no horrible greasy bloated feeling after the meal! I'd say give it a go on a weekday, get a Thali, be prepared to do things their way, and whatever you do, DON'T order the 'Masala Coke'. Trust me on that last one.",

The lassi here was good but not as good as at Dishoom. The thali was good as well, I had mine with the Mutton Vindaloo. My husband had Chicken Green curry. Both curries were good, mine was moderately spicy. The food overall was good, not amazing but I would come back as it's convenient to where we are staying. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The hanging marionettes are cool and the service was decent.",

Masala Zone is located in Covent garden and the restaurant has a tasteful nod to Indian culture with the colourful Rajasthan puppets suspended from the wall. The warm orange decor provides a cool contemporary setting to enjoy fabulous Indian food.The food is really good value and I normally go for the regular chicken or lamb thali. The thali is a traditional way of eating in India and is a steel platter of various dishes including vegetables, meat/ fish curry, chapati, chutney and rice. It is great to have so many different flavours in one meal and the prices range from \u00a37.80 to \u00a38.25. I also recommend the prawn malai which is a prawn coconut sauce served with rice- delicious!Masala Zone is excellent value for money and a great place for lunch and dinner.",

The restaurant itself is not intimidating and is very nicely decorated. My boyfriend and I were seated outside originally and ordered some staples like Chicken Tikka Masala. The waitress brought out several smaller dishes, which I couldn't identify but they were some of the best flavors I've ever tasted. There was definitely some cilantro sauce that was perfect. It began to rain and our waitress promptly moved us inside, which reflected great on their service. Very friendly place. I could not be happier with my experience here and have not stopped thinking about this place since I got back to the states. I would recommend this place for anyone who loves Indian and to people that haven't tried it before. They will never look back!! YUM!",

This past visit we both ordered regular thalis: myself with the Paneer Mukamwalla and my friend the Green curry chicken. It's a great variety of food: 2 vegetables, daal, the curry you pick, 2 chapatis or rice, pampadan with chuntneys. They're certainly not skimping on value for money.After the meal we ordered drinks: mint infusion and chai masala, both really nice. The chai isn't very spicy but it's nice and tasty. My only gripe with Masala Zone is that it clearly isn't made to order. The food comes out shockingly quickly. However, for a full dinner in Covent Garden with waiter service it was still under \u00a315 each. You can't complain at that (we didn't have drinks with the meal, just water). I'm sure I'll be back again and it's certainly worth a try if you're up for Indian in the Covent Garden area. The atmosphere is nice and intimate and we couldn't complain about the service!",

    "text": "Nice theme and approach that is different to most indian restaurants. The trouble with 'authentic' Indian cuisine is that there is such a wide variety of styles and tastes in the subcontinent that it's difficult to say that any region in particular really sums up Indian cooking. However, compared with my experience of India, it's not a bad resemblance of the food in Northern India. Chipattis where top, made with brown flower as was the Rogan Josh - lots of flavour and you could really taste the spices. Dahl was a little runny but rice was really good. To top if off they do real Indian desserts (not just Kulfi!!!), I had ice cream and Gulab Jamon which is a great way to finish a good Indian. Food came in a flash, it's clear they make everything en mass and serve it up to order. The quality is still great though. I even managed to get a photo of the dolls - nice touch. Can anyone spot which Hindu gods are represented on the ceiling for me? Oh yeah, bill came to \u00a322 inc drink which isn't too bad at all.",

    "text": "Having lived in Tooting for a period of time, there's a tendency to get spoilt by cheap and cheerful Indian restaurants, with even the most mediocre of the curry houses in SW17 providing a decent, affordable meal. I only mention this by way of comparison with Masala Zone, a chain of restaurants around London's more fashionable locations, because a mediocre curry in Tooting, or most other parts on London, is Michelin star quality compared to the food from here. We went in a group of six after wanting something nearby and reasonably quick and cheap. Masala Zone certainly looks appealing - bright lights, special Indian decorations hanging from the ceiling, and friendly service. If only the food was as good as the service. We were greeted with a smile, our waiter showed infinite patience with a chatty, indecisive group, and when the food arrived, the waitress took time to talk through the Thalis that we'd ordered. The quality of the Tahli was as mixed as the food itself. The Lentil Daal was surprisingly tasty with a nice kick to it, while the riata was a nice consistency. Potatoes covered in coconut were fine, and the pumpkins were a touch on the bland side, while an onion bhaji was unmemorable. But any curry house is judged on the staples and the flaccid poppadums and soggy chapati didn't inspire confidence. As for the lamb rogan josh, this was one very timid little lamb. There was some form of spice in here, but very little flavour. Bland doesn't quite do this dish justice. There was none of the punch or subtly a good rogan josh offers, just a big vacuum where the taste should be. At least it was edible. My friend asked me if I recognised the flavour in her paneer dish. It certainly wasn't spicy or traditionally Indian. \"It tastes like Heinz tomato soup,\" was her conclusion after a few bites. Tomato soup with a few spices and some spectacularly dry and tasteless paneer thrown in. It remained untouched. You could say with Masala Zone that you get what you pay for, especially given the location. But I've had cheaper, tastier curries in London, and equally decent meals in chains around Covent Garden. Michel Roux Jr is currently on TV pushing the virtues of good service and he'd no doubt approve of Masala Zone. But on the basis of this meal, I'd happily swap the unfailingly cheerful service for a local curry house where the indifferent waiter pushes a plate of freshly-cooked speciality full of flavour in front of you before retiring to the kitchen to read the paper.",

This night we found ourselves in London, England in pursuit of good, representative, and affordable Indian food. Masala Zone delivered on all three and could easily become a regular location if not for it being inconveniently located 5371 miles from my apartment. Masala Zone specializes in Thali style service, which means you order a curry of your choice and the rest of the meal is comprised of a little bowls of deliciousness selected by the kitchen. Diner in Crime (DINC) was able to identify each dish, but all I knew is each one was quit different from the other but all equally scrumptious. For the curry I ordered a spicy chicken and she ordered a lamb concoction, both of which were savored to the last bite.The one letdown would definitely have to be the naan, which wasn't very warm or tasty... just \"eh\" bread. It was the one thing I didn't finish on a platter /filled/ with food. DINC also believed the chapati had gone stale... though I'm unclear how a bread that is supposed to be crunchy can go stale.I see some of the reviews here take issue with the \"optional\" tip that is added to every bill. Not being very familiar with the tipping practices in England, I can't say how normal this is... but it's true that the service wasn't anything that would warrant an amazing tip. I suppose, in that respect, it is targeting more tourists than not. But as a tourist in a strange place, looking for good food, I really couldn't have been happier with that dinner.",

This probably is the best deal, especially when you don't know what exactly to have---- for less than 15 pounds, you can get a taste of everything!My friends had rotis, nams and rice together with different gravy dishes. They were good, but again, I think i'd had much better ones before. They taste...well \u00a0just typically restaurant-style (yeah, what do I expect at a restaurant anyway...?) \u00a0The lamb chop was good though, worth trying, but other than this and the thali, I wasn't really impressed to be honest. The 6 of us ended up spending over 110 pounds without drinks, which was pricy compared with the quality of the food.",

Their lunch deals are great value for money because you get a starter, and a your choice of curry for just about \u00a310. You can also choose a 3 course that includes dessert, but I have never felt the need to.I'm a creature of habit and tend to always gravitate towards the Butter Chicken. The flavors of the curry are spot on and the chicken is always tender and juicy. My only issue is that it could do with a bit more heat, but that's just me. Garlic Naan is amazing as is their samosas and pau bhaji. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I've been to this Covent Garden branch as well as the one in Carnaby Street. I think I prefer this one, just because I love the area as well as the decor in this particular restaurant. The hanging dolls just look so cool and work well with ambiance.",

So yes, it feels like a chain unlike many of London's restaurant chains which in fact, don't.The overall rating is at best, mediocre. First, the negatives. The food doesn't taste fresh and that's pretty much a deal killer. The street food bit is tempting, but to the Indian - street food must look like street food. Don't try to gourmet up Indian street food, never works. Soggy 'bhel' is a total no-no. So yeah, give me something to work on here. On a positive note though, the menu is surprisingly well done. There is an element of creativity and imagination in the menu. The street food element is refreshing, although it tastes nothing like street food. The afternoon platter is brilliant, albeit not because it is ingenious or delicious, but because I haven't found something similar in a restaurant setting. The deserts are not too bad either.Needs a lot more work on improving the quality of food.",

    "text": "Needing a quick dinner before catching a play (The Mousetrap) near Covent Garden we hastily bundled in to Masala Zone as the missus and I agreed that a curry was needed and Masala Zone could turn it over quickly enough. And they did. Hoorah!The service is brisk (are they on commission per customer served?) but with a smile, of sorts. The atmosphere is lively and there's plenty o' bustle in the seating gallies, Masala Zone thrive on turning over large numbers of customers. There may even be a queue for a table but this won't last. The menu isn't vast so this aids a quick selection which suited us and the staff and the meals arrived quicker than we expected too. Almost suspiciously quick.Everything was in order and the food was actually more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Unfortunately, less than an hour later in the theatre my bowels disagreed which may not have been entirely pleasant for the audience members in my immediate area. That meal did arrive suspiciously quickly.All things considered the experience was more or less what we wanted, a decent meal in a short time. In future, if I want a nice meal I probably wouldn't seek out Masala Zone but if I'm in the area and just need some dinner (especially a quick dinner), of course I'd go back.TTFN,Ian",

Wow! So glad I did. Great taste, spice, and a lot of food!Tables were perhaps slightly too close together.

It's nice for a bit though I couldn't finish it as the flavours got a little overwhelming towards the end.Everything was cooked well and tasty so if you're looking for an Indian that is a little different then this is probably a good place to try.It can get busy so choose your arrival time carefully.",

The thali food tastes good but nothing extra ordinary. The ambience and service very good and prompt. I love and prefer the food at tayyabs better (and since then found other restaurants that I like more than masala zone). It is worth coming here with family/friends...I you order a starter + drinks + thali + desert, it will come to \u00a320 ish/person...I did feel it's over hyped and my experience with the restaurant manager wasn't great... They as usual gave us a feedback form, so put down my comments there to convey that I did not find it truly authentic. Feedback is supposed to be appreciated and kept anonymous. But the manager actually stopped us on our way out and questions our judgement.. Arrogant! He sorta embarrassed himself by asking us among a bunch of others diners. We were certainly the only Indians at the restaurant, and I knew what I was talking about. Why did he take it so personally? Watch out for feedback forms and sensitive/arrogant managers! ;-)",

Veg mains virtually non-existent, only saw a paneer dish. Ordered a side of spinach with garlic, masala papad, side of dal makhani and paneer lababdar, chapattis, naans. Only dish worth a mention was the side of spinach. The worst being the paneer, all it reeked of was cream and sugar, like \u00a0dessert. The dal was very disappointing too. Chapatti dry and flavourless. \u00a0Never going back, there was a reason I stayed away. Restaurants that try to be everything to everyone, imo, are always strictly avoidable.",

This goes for the decor as well - no elephants and mirrors thankfully!\u00a0We decided to dine there on a whim; which meant waiting for 30 mins. on a weekday. Make reservations please! They have interesting starters and mains - though me and the husband regretted our starters. I went for Pav Bhaji - it was super tasty, but I ended up not finishing my mains. The husband ordered batter-fried prawns - a wrong choice and something that shouldn't be on the menu as it doesn't go with the overall feel of their food.Both the mains were good - lamb kolhapuri and the thali. I made a gluttonous mistake ordering a thali - but it was pretty good. The potatoes and the mangalore chicken curry were the stars! Many restaurants in India can't get the latter right, but these guys had the right consistency and taste. Bravo!\u00a0What I didn't like - they ran out of a dish for the thali, so just served the same dal in two bowls to compensate without informing us.\u00a0Service - OK. Although one lady got us a steamed hot glass for beer and then another one got us the wrong bill. The man who took our orders was friendly, courteous and keen to hear feedback.\u00a0The second time.rpund, service was terrible and painfully slow.Overall - I'll go again, but on an empty stomach.",

    "text": "This was the worst case of shady underhanded tactics I have ever witnessed at a restaurant. I ordered a grand thali. The quality of food was exceptionally bad for Indian food, but that's not the worst folly. The Grand Thali was supposed to have pea pualo and dahi pakodi as the main items.The server brought the thali out. The lachha paratha was rubbery as if it had been cooked way earlier and had just been reheated up. The server also didn't know what item was what, since they were not well trained. As I was eating, I noticed that the alleged dahi pakodi did not have any pakodi in it and was just plain yogurt. I asked the hostess who seated me and she said that she would go in and check. In the meantime, I started eating the rice only to find that it was plain steamed rice and not pea pulao. When the waitress came back, she told me that they had run out of dahi pakodi, so they had substituted plain yogurt (without asking me or even telling me after the fact). I asked about the peas pulao, she went back, and came back and said that they ran out of peas so they substituted steamed rice (again, without asking me or telling me afterwards. Probably hoping I would not notice the two major items replaced with plain rice and yogurt). See attached pictures to see what the grand thali should contain as per the menu, and what it actually ended up being.Now when I ordered the item, I was expecting to get what was on the menu. If it was not available, they should have come back and asked me if the substitutions were alright with me or would I like to change my order. What they did actually was substitute some of the main attractions with plain yogurt and steamed rice without even telling me and hoping that I would not notice. Eventually they brought some boiled chickpeas and said that they could put that in the rice. THAT IS NOT PEAS PULAO. That would be boiled peas with steamed rice, and not a peas pulao. That would be me you ordering a hamburger, and the restaurant bringing out some boiled beef and some raw bread and calling it a day.Even after bringing these up to the attention of the staff, no sincere effort was made to replace the items with the correct items, or make any amends. This is basically cheating and fraud/misrepresentation to some degree. I am very dissatisfied. I sent them two emails with this experience hoping that at least some manager will note these transgressions against whoever was responsible and take steps to prevent other patrons from having the same experience, but no one has gotten back to me for almost a month now. Terrible experience, and no customer service whatsoever.",

After wandering around Covent Garden, and literally running into the BAFTA's going on, we were ready for a hearty dinner and Masala Zone was perfect. We started with some vegetable samosa and naan, both of which were so fresh and chock full of flavor. We all got thali and it was the perfectly balanced and proportioned meal. The thali consists of two chutneys, two curries, rice/bread, and a spicy paste and it's a great way to sample different bits of the menu. I stuck to the spicy vegetarian curry and loved it! The restaurant is decorated with hanging Indian marionette puppets, which creates a cozy and very colorful atmosphere and is quite large. It would be a fun place for a large family/friends dinner. I am taking one star away from service as we had about four different people serve us and it became very confusing. Everyone was extremely helpful and kind but it was hard to keep everyone straight! I am sure there is other great Indian food in London, but if you are near Covent Garden Masala Zone is worth checking out.",

They told us that a platter would only feed one person but it is definitely large enough for two! Extremely flavorful and lots of great variety on the platters. I also ordered the drink with chili vodka (I forget what it's called but it was the second one on the menu, with the chili vodka and grenadine) and it was very good, albeit a little sweet.

As we were seated and brought menus and some water, we kept looking up at the several hundred puppets from Rajasthan suspended from the ceiling. It was quite a sight to see.Covent Garden being a fairly expensive area of London, we were happy to see that they offered lunch specials; we gladly took advantage of those and were able to get a combo for \u00a310 which included a starter and an entree.Ironically enough, because my sister lived so close and it was a great, go-to, cheap lunch, we ended up going there multiple times and were able to try quite a few dishes \u00a0- especially since their combos are offered up as thalis which are a selection of small dishes served up an an entree. From their tikka malasa to their chappati, the raita, the dal, the rice, everything was always good. Especially their butter chicken. I ever tried their very unique Masala Coke which is a Coca~Cola beverage sprinkled with some Indian spices and some mint. It was uniquely refreshing albeit a bit weird. Service there is always quick, efficient and pretty attentive. The place was also very clean, spacious and convenient located. We're fans.",

But the experience is worth a try for sure.",

Then I had the veggie curry and it was delicious although I would've liked some sort of protein, maybe tofu or seitan. However the sauce was delicious! I'll be back!",

For regular thali you can choose between rice or chapatiThe ambience is really pretty though with small rajasthani puppets suspended from the ceiling. It looks pretty in hereThe service is a little slow but since it is crowded it is acceptable. The servers are courteous though",

    "text": "\"Great location and decor with a good menu selection\"Date of Visit: 05.03.18Time: 12.48pmReview: I know the chain owns a number of restaurants not just the Masala Zone selection but others include Chutney Mary, Veeraswamy, Amaya and Masala Grill. Now I have tried Veeraswamy so few more yet to try. \u00a0A great location which soon fully filled up. Very friendly service and good portion sizes. Even though I arrived early and spent over 2 hours I had no hassle or stress and no sense I had to rush. I cannot say the same for all restaurants who should take a leaf out of this resturant's book. The food however I have a mixed thoughts about as I feel it is a little toned down to cater for the tourist trade which I guess is fine but I have eaten better and I think they may need to innovate a bit as there is a lot of competition. However it is a tried and tested taste and selection is good so cannot fault that you know what you will get and food should work for everyone even if a large group. Dress Code: No dress codeBooking Process: Very easy booking process and all my details to hand. Location: 48 Floral Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DA. Tel: 020 7379 0101. Cuisine Type: IndianParking: No parking that I am ware of but given the proximity to public transport this is a very convenient and easy to reach location. Decor & Lighting: A unique interior with a selection of dolls placed around the ceiling Decor is nice with people loving the puppets and taking photos. Lighting just right and feels intimate but big windows to watch the world go byHeating and Cooling: It was a bright and warm day but the temperature was just right inside. Ambience & Acoustics: Light background music playing but you can hardly hear it. The resturant soon filled up and nice mixture of people which I guess you would expect given the location. There is an open kitchen which is always good to see but not loud or distracting. Easy to speak and have conversations so some great acoustics. \u00a0DB Level: 68.3DBDrinks: Bollywood Beats a non-alcoholic drink which was very refreshing and I had to have two. Had the following: Papadams & Chutneys: Classic Papadams served with three home made chutneys as follows: Mango which was fresh and zingy, a Red sauce which was hot and spicy and a Green sauce little kick but also nice. I was very happy with all three. \u00a0Grand Thali (Non-Veg): This is a selection of items and you get to choose the main dish element (I had the butter chicken). The Chana dal nice but a little plain and very mild. Cobi Aloo was nice with a flavoursome sauce. Okra was served in a nice tomato sauce and I do not normally eat Okra so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this and the Raita was also nice but a taste as you would expect. Butter chicken was the real disappointment as it was mild and large pieces of chicken served which was not that tasty. Onion bhaji was crispy and fried and had a classic heavy onion taste. Rice was nice but could do with more and finally the Roti was nice and thin. The dishes were nice but nothing special and just a classic taste but no fusion and nothing special to report.Desert: Desert chocolate brownie masala. Nice ice cream with hint of cinnamon but the brownie was not hot (just a little warm) with crunchy parts inside. In summary the brownie was a bit dry. I have had a lot better so would skip dessert here in the future or try a different item. Bill / Cost: \u00a341.35 total with drinks and dessertConclusion: Great location and decor and somewhere you take a group or someone who likes Indian food but cannot cope with anything too spicy and is not an Indian foodie. I would go again if I just wanted something quick and would put this in the same range a fast food rather than fine dining or something you would remember or want to visit specially.",

    "text": "This was just okay - it's a large restaurant and I like the colourful decorations on the ceiling, but the dishes here were a little hit or miss for me. I love Dishoom and would rather wait an hour to eat at Dishoom than to dine here. This place specializes more in thalis, which is like a big platter with one main curry (chicken, lamb, prawn, vegetarian), small sides, dal, rice, and papadum. We were 2 people and shared one grand thali, added an extra curry, and got one appetizer, and that was enough food.We got there at 9 pm on a Friday, and were told it was a 30 min wait, but we were seated in 5 min. The host wasn't exactly the nicest or particularly helpful/friendly.Pao Bhaji - This is a spicy potato and vegetable mash with a warm buttered bread roll. At Dishoom, this is one of my favourite dishes. Here, this was disappointing to me. The mash was kind of just plopped down on the plate and was a pretty small portion - probably 1/3 or 1/2 of the mash that you get at Dishoom. and the bread didn't seem as soft and fresh as Dishoom. The bread was warm and buttered, but overall, having just eaten the Pao Bhaji the day before at Dishoom, this was really a letdown for me. I'd pass on this dish.Grand Thali - Comes with one curry (chicken, lamb, prawn, vegetarian), 2 vegetables side dishes (mainly potatoes), 1 dal/lentil, a papadum, raita, and rice. We also got an extra butter chicken curry which I liked - it was super creamy and the chicken was tender. I didn't care for the lamb, I could only taste cloves, like the sauce had an entire bag of cloves dumped in and then simmered for 10 hours. The meat itself was just okay. The vegetable dishes and dal were also just okay - nothing to write home about, as were the chapattis - they didn't seem terribly fresh or soft.All in all, I would pass on this place and won't be back. The service was just okay, the food was mediocre and not super cheap (Dishoom seems cheaper to me), and even though it's more traditional than Dishoom, I think there are probably better Indian restaurants in London if you're looking for more traditional food with curries and thalis.",

Management was very friendly and came by and chatted with us for a bit. \u00a0Our server was attentive and friendly as well. \u00a0Glad we found Masala Zone for a wonderful Indian dinner in London.",

It's a great location just behind the Covent Garden opera house and a convenient place to eat dinner if you're going to see an opera.

I'd recommend the chicken and mango curry: it sounds like a bizarre combination of sweet and sour, but there is so much spice in the dish that you can barely taste the mango. Maybe parents good give to children in an attempt to make them eat the fruit without realising it. I just wish I could they could produce a better selection of pickles for the poppadoms.",

Ok most importantly the food, it was delicious! When you order this combo kind of thing where you order 1 main curry and it comes with 3-4 different types of sauces to dip. It also comes with a little side of the chutney. It was such a dining experience being able to try 3-4 different kind of sauces.

    "text": "Hot on the heels of finding the Qype application for Android, I set about trying to find alternatives to the restaurants that I usually ended up at and this came highly recommended it seems. I don't know why. My friend and I arrived with anticipation of a good Indian meal and we left with the feeling of a mediocre Indian meal. The decor was interesting and functional, if not a little over-decorated (Especially with regards to the small legions of dolls on the ceiling!). The service was pleasant if not a little understaffed, and the price was definitely an agreeable one. The main problem however, was with the food. I admit that since moving down to London the bar has been raised as far as my expectations for restaurants is concerned, but I feel like the food simply doesn't measure up. The poppadums were room temperature and had a texture like they had been made a good long while ago (ie: Not crunchy). The main course, a Rogan Josh, came across as mediocre in flavour, with far too little meat and far too much sauce. In addition the meat was slightly dry and, again, of mediocre quality. The garlic Naan was nice, however it looked a lot more like a chapatti and tasted like it had been baked in an oven rather than cooked in a tandoor (Think a cross between tortilla and pitabread and you're on the right tracks). And it, like the main course, was inundated in coriander leaf. Coriander's nice, but it has a very soapy taste, especially when present in large quantities. On the other hand, the passion fruit sorbet was very nice and anywhere that does mango lassis can't be all bad in my books, but my experience with the poppadums and main course makes me think that this place likes to over-do it with pre-preparation and as a result loses the freshness, and with Indian cuisine (Or really ANY kind of cuisine) freshness is paramount to a good meal. Overall for the price I paid I don't mind the place, and it was a pleasant enough experience, but the food was mediocre at best. You may think I may be judging the place a bit too harshly, but the truth is I have had fantastic meals for a fiver more than this place (Which I believe is probably the reason why my bar is set so high!), and as a result I simply cannot recommend this place. Not when there's so much better for so little more out there.",

    "text": "I passed this place a few times when walking around Covent Garden, and thought it looked like a fab place to take my boyfriend for his birthday. WHAT A MISTAKE.We couldn't book a table so we joined the queue on a Friday evening - queues always make a place look good, so I was really hopeful and didn't mind waiting 10/15 minutes. The decor on the ground floor level is amazing - Indian puppets line the ceiling, filling the room with colour. To be honest that's ALL that impressed me through the entire evening.We finally made it to the front of the queue. Here's where it starts to go bad. We were offered a table around the corner, where no indian puppets hung, by the kitchen, and next to an electric fuse box that was letting off such an ear piercingly loud buzzing noise I didn't even sit down. I politely asked if we could have another table, and we were taken back to the front of the queue whilst they sorted out somewhere else for us to sit. To my amazement, they then tried to fob off the same buzzing table to the poor couple behind us! Lo & behold, that couple came back one minute later with the same complaint. Nice try.We were then taken downstairs (I didnt realise they even had a downstairs) to a large room with LOTS of empty tables, no decor at all compared to what was on the ground floor, and no ambience whatsoever - no music, no people, cold, bleak decor. Just awful.Again, I asked to have a table upstairs, as it had been the upstairs decor that lured us in. After another 10 minutes of waiting, we were finally seated at a table for two on the puppet floor. Thank God. We were STARVING at this point, having saved ourselves all day for this \"incredible Indian food\" we thought we'd be gorging on.We both ordered the platters of food, I think they're called Thalis. A big silver platter comes with tiny little bowls of food - basically like a trial & error testing dish. I hated all of it. My curry was meant to be mild & coconutty - it was bland, far too hot, and had no taste at all. My poor boyfriend, who's food was also disgusting, had lost his temper, anger got the better of him, and he decided he couldn't eat anymore. Poor guy, on his birthday too!To top it all off, the prices weren't great, so we forked out about \u00a330 for a bland tasteless dinner of tiny weeny dishes, none of them that we liked.Honestly guys, don't go there. Try your local Indian instead - bound to be far better.And if you're in Covent Garden and need someplace good to eat, walk to Wardour Street and go to Busaba instead - my love affair with Thai food began in this very restaurant!!",

They're just a step up from fast food; or perhaps the more accurate term would be street food, as you tend to get it in India. It's a bit like Imli (qype.co.uk/place/72917-I\u2026) , though cheaper. Check out the menu (PDF) (masalazone.com/downloads\u2026) . They have dozens of dishes,. Try the sev puri and clove-smoked lamb korma. Mmm. It's not luxurious or trying to be uber-authentic; it is honest about being an Anglicised Indian family restaurant, and honest about not being gourmet, but trying to aim for that reasonable middle ground. This location features north Indian specialities, and has hundreds of Rajasthani puppets hanging from the ceiling. Fun. There were also lots of Indian families eating here when I was last in, so take that hint. You can eat in the restaurant, obviously, or get takeaway or delivery (free over \u00a315).",

Its alright if you want a quick feed, but are not too bothered about the quality, but you wouldn't go there to impress anyone. I've been there a couple of times and the food is ok at best. The first time the food was lukewarm and the second is was boiling hot, which smacks of food prepared much earlier and reheated as ordered. If you want a decent curry, I would recommend Sartaj on Earlham St, Seven Dials.",

    "text": "Ok, so the food was.decent, the restaurant was clean, and the staff pretty attentive but something lacked. I went on saturday night and the place was busy. On looking at the very limited menu, it is immediately obvious that this is not a traditional Indian restaurant that the majority of us are used to. It is as far from the Brick Lane type restarant as you could get! Best way to describe it is to imagine a fast turnover americanised version and you've probably got the picture.Food is very reasonably priced where a main course with rice for \u00a39 is excellent BUT they are a rip-off for alcohol. I'm afraid any Indian restaurant that takes you for \u00a33.50 for a tiny 300ml of cobra loses my vote (should be a pint for that price). Hope this helps you decide.",

At Masala Zone the cuisine is not limited to boring traditional dishes like Prawn,Lamb or Chicken cooked in a hurried takeaway style,but offers more interesting and healthier varieties that depict changing trends in Indian restaurant cookery. As more and more young British Asians tend to eat out their palates have become more discerning and eating habits in Great Britain tend to reflect that. The menu is split between street food and the well balanced Thali Meal. Either way the high quality of ingredients used in the preparation of the dishes is very indicative of the more affulent taste of Britain. After perusing the Masala Zone menu over a thick Mango Lassi and a juicy Mango Bellini we began with a vegetarian and warm meat grazing platters of street food.This came with a delicious Bhel-crunchy salad with crushed peanuts,Sev Puri,Chutney,Dhai Puri. For the carnivores in us there were the minced Lamb patties stuffed with herbs,steaming hot Chicken Samosas and minced Lamb Kebabs. The flavours were light,fresh and balanced by a cooling yoghurt which was made with tempering spice. Indian food does not have to be Chilli hot to be tasty.The Thali offers a choice of 12 curries all accompanied by Poppadums,Chutneys,Dhal,Rice and vegetarian dishes of the day. Not particularly adventurous with fiery cuisines I opted for the mildly spiced Prawn Malai flavoured with Coconut while my partner chose the spicer Lamb Rogan Josh. Both dishes were accompanied by a superb Pumpkin and Aubergine side dish, as well as a helping of perfectly cooked Basmati rice.",

I have to admit that it has not a traditional indian design, but I like this modern touch about it.The restaurant offers all the usual indian dishes like beryani and daal, which taste very nice and over all it is reasonable priced.But i have to warn you with the dessert: some of these ones are just horrible. I ordred something that looked like and small whithe tennis ball unfortunatly it also tasted the same but hey no risk no fun.It is a good restaurant to go to, but I would recommend it more to the people that were already in every restaurant in Covent Garden and want to go for something different.",

    "text": "Excellent Indian restaurant in Covent Garden. We dined about 5pm so there were only another 4 tables in. The service from our main server was amazing. Very friendly and knowledgeable lady (think she was called Sharmila). She talked us all through the menu and different options and nothing seemed too much trouble. The food itself was very tasty and you got a lot of food for the money. We both had a grand thali and had trouble finishing them - and it was only \u00a39!! Think our waitress went on break just as we'd finished our mains and service was definitely slower. However, would definitely eat there again!",
