I wondered how long our plates had been sitting waiting for someone to serve. Service - its was only just ok. When they took away our main plates.... were were ignored for the next 1/2 hour- no question of did we want more drinks/dessert/bill. Just simply not acknowledged at all. I had to flag someone down to tell them we did actually want to see the dessert menu and order another round. With a service charge included at 12.5% and the fact the upstairs is the \"restaurant\" I actually expected to be waited on! For the prices, and reviews around I had definitely expected better.

I believe it was \u00a325 prix fixe for three meals.I ordered this pork belly dish that was one of the best pork belly I had ever tasted. It was so, so succulent and melted in your mouth, the way that braised meat should be. I don't remember what appetizer or dessert I ordered, so I guess they weren't as memorable, haha.The reason why I'm only giving it three stars is because first, they required a down payment (NOT a deposit). What?!? For a big group, I understand wanting some kind of security in the event of cancellation, but no restaurant I've eaten at has ever asked for money UP FRONT. Normally they take a credit card and apply some penalty charge if we don't show up. So strange. Secondly, one of our friends got stuck at work and couldn't make it to dinner, so we asked them to wrap up her steak so she could eat it later. They literally just rolled it in a ball of foil that later leaked all over the inside of her bag. We ordered her a side dish of greens which was never wrapped up. I know that asking to get food wrapped up at the end isn't as common in the UK and Europe as it is in America but... surely for a more upscale place like this, the request wasn't so rare that they wouldn't have takeaway containers on hand?",

The Roast was absolutely delightful! Raves all around. The service was quite exceptional as well. Very friendly, fun and swift from start to finish. My mother and I split the Guineafowl Roast (for 2) -- and at 25 quid, very reasonable. Everyone was picking off our plates, a very large portion and delicious. There were various mixed roasts, roast beef, duck and lentil salads, and the list goes on. End with Sticky Toffee with ice cream and a Rhubarb Custard Crumble. And rose champagne. And coffee. And...stuffed! The perfect Roast. So why only 4-stars? Well, it was a surefire 5 if not for a few issues with the private booking. But other than this, it was absolutely lovely and I'll surely return for another Roast. Not one complaint in the bunch. Just beautiful! Private Party Booking: *Tip -- make one for Sunday Roast, this place is busy. I made a booking for our large group, Sunday 4pm. For parties over 8 they require a 10 quid/pp deposit and a set menu. This was handled by Duncan, and all went very smoothly. Form is quite easy to fill out, deposit charged to my credit card, etc. A few missteps with the booking: Our party all arrived on time (nice!) and our table was ready upstairs in the dining room, but when our last remaining 3 came they were told it wasn't ready even though we were all upstairs and they gave our name. This delayed them a good 10 minutes as they waited and thought we were not there. The table was a bit crunched, despite the advanced booking and missing one place setting/chair, which had to be placed on the end. Then...no set menu? We asked and they were confused. \"Oh no, we only do that for dinner, you can do a la carte.\" Which, actually worked better for us, but after all the fuss with the private booking and the set menu (which was sent to me on PDF) -- this seemed strange. Finally, the 100GBP deposit was not taken off the bill. I had to ask for it to be subtracted. All in all, I wondered if anyone actually had even told them we were coming. For a booking where I had to do a fair bit of prep, form-filling, depositing, etc...I expected a bit more. I'll be back though, probably with just a smaller group!",

Now back to the 3 stars...,the food is very nice. We shared a smoked salmon starter and I followed with a ribeye steak cautiously ordered medium and it actually came out medium rather than me having to lasso the meat from the plate. But, and this is the small but, the servings were tiny. Pricey and tiny. The ribeye seemed as though it had been sliced through the middle to make two portions (it seemed as though I had one half and someone got the other), the home made \u00a0chips were maliciously cut chunks of potatoes deep fried and lightly garnished with some vegetable matter. The side of chard did not appeal to me. The wine was ok, but scarily overpriced when cross referenced against Vivino (\u00a37 average price versus \u00a338 restaurant price). The dessert, now required, was also petite. Calling the portion microscopic would be a little unfair. So better value found elsewhere with less of a climb to the meal.",

    "text": "This place is pretty out-of-the-way for me on any normal day, but we ventured in last night after work (in The City) and before jazz (in Dalston)... Shoreditch being sort of equidistant between the two. Like others have said, it gets really busy with post-workers from The City. Because the crowd was spilling out into the side street, we decided the best plan of attack was dinner in the much more civilized dining room upstairs. The menus are pretty much the same, though the pub grub (i.e. cottage pie, fish n' chips) are only served downstairs.Of course, this brilliant plan only worked for about thirty minutes before enormous groups of suits started appearing to commence 'work dinners.' It was a lovely half-hour, though. The space is subdued, open, and bright with a large fireplace on one end and the wrought iron spiral staircase at the other. And the food was just as lovely.I had the soup of the day, a pureed pea and ham number that was divine. My main of grilled sea bass in yellow pepper and tomato gazpacho was fab. It tasted just as delicious as the fish and gazpacho I love in southern Spain. The hubs' duck and chicken terrine was bland, but the steak and chips he had after were done beautifully. We washed it all down with a reasonably priced bottle of French rose. It was an excellent meal.The only real fault I could find was the fact that there is no toilet upstairs, which means you must navigate the (precarious after a couple drinks) staircase to use the one in the pub. On the upside, however, I noticed their advertisement on the back of the stall door for a pretty nice lunch deal (the dinner menu just with the lighter options) of 2-courses for 14 pounds or 3-courses for 18. Not a bad offering, especially if you work in The City and are looking for a lovely sit-down lunch.",

I quite agree that their Bloody Mary takes some beating - as does their rather extensive and reasonably priced wine list. I usually opt for the mixed roast as it has a bit of everything and everything is cooked well. The homemade condiments are a must, especially the homemade horseradish. I would recommend booking in advance as otherwise you will have to wait at least an hour for a table.",

It does succeed somewhat, it's very pretty but I am yet to feel it distinguishes itself from residing neighbours. However, it does not sell bottled water, one step further to reducing that carbon footprint.",

Our initial thought was that we'd stroll around and see the neighborhood before dinner, but the rain made us consider a pint or glass of wine instead. The place was packed and the only possible table was a large group that was clearing out as we arrived. When we started to take over, the GM (Dan) politely let us know the table was reserved for another expected group. We told him we were early for our dinner reservations and he quickly changed gears and invited us to sit at the vacant table while he notified the dining room we were early and prepared for the upcoming party. He provided wine and beer via table service and reset the table while we waited for the dining room to re-open. Soon, our table was ready and we ascended the spiral staircase and enjoyed a fantastic dinner. Very possibly the best lamb I've ever had. The dining room is a great contrast to the noisy/hip pub below and the service was refined, but not stuffy. If you are looking for a fantastic meal and experience while exploring London's hottest neighborhood, there's no need to look any further.",

I had the parsnip soup which was tasteless & under seasoned. I couldn't manage more than a couple of spoonfuls. Next I had the turkey. This was reasonably moist but very fatty.

Humbly tucked away down Paul street (turn right at the cow rubbish bins, straight on 'til morning...), it feels about as far away from Shoreditch as Hampstead's famed Holly Bush, which can be fantastic or tragic, based on your personal preferences. Although bit on the pricey side, this was certainly one of the finest Sunday Roasts I've had here in London. However as the meal was ending, we were asked to move tables... apparently to make room for a group of 5 who had walked in... \u00a0 ? It was very odd as the three of us had a reservation... and were literally half way through our \u00a390 meal. Perhaps this was a 5-star move for the folks waiting, but it was definitely a star detractor for me.",

My friend and I each ordered the Sunday roast; she had the sirloin and I had the lamb. To begin, the waitstaff was extremely friendly and we felt right at home. A few pints of cidre were served right away while my friend and I debated between the pork, lamb and beef. When the massive portions arrived in front of us, we were in awe. One of the waitstaff came over with a plate full of different sauces/accompaniments. For my lamb, I got the mint sauce which was amazing and my friend the mustard. The waiter was very helpful in making recommendations as to which we should pair with our proteins. The potatoes were incredible--delightfully crisp on the outside while light and creamy on the inside. The vegetables were perfectly cooked, the Yorkshire pudding was light and flaky and delicious and the gravy was great!We finished the meal with some classic sticky toffee pudding that was divine!Overall it was somewhat pricey, but DEFINITELY worth every penny.",

There was a VERY thick cut version and a thinner version more akin to McDonald's fries (please don't shoot daggers at me for mentioning Micky-Dees). I thought the thinner chips were tastier, but that's just my preference.The fish n chips come with mushy peas, which helped balance out the greasiness of the food. Loved loved loved the mayo sauce for dipping the chips in. I got a dry white wine that the bartender recommended. I told him that I prefer a dry white that's not sweet or sour.

Let me just say...I was slightly puzzled as to how to get to the second floor of the building because that's where the group was already seated. I saw the spiral staircase and the door to it...but I normally think that those doors are usually locked right? Anyway after wandering into the side entrance I inched my way through the VERY packed downstairs area...up to the second floor. This was an interesting feat because those spiral stairs are a bit tricky...especially with heels...Anyway the party was seated at the large table in the corner and thankfully I wasn't the last to arrive. NOW TO THE FOOD...they have a daily menu I believe and it looked pretty good!I ordered the 3 course menu meal...but at the time...I chose 2...The menu offered the following selections:2 courses for \u00a325 or 3 courses for \u00a330.50starters: Roasted golden beetroot soup, chives (v)Globe artichoke, smoked garlic mayo (v)Potted crab, avocado, mango salsa Rabbit rillettes, cornichons toastmains:Jerusalem artichoke, risotto, baby spinach, taleggio (v)slow roasted pork belly ,braised cheek, black pudding croquetteSole, saut\u00e9ed potatoes (something else)28 day aged sirloin, watercress, double dipped chips, red wine jusdesserts:caramelized peaches, homemade vanilla ice cream sticky toffee pudding, toffee sauce, homemade vanilla ice creamCheese platechocolate fondant, homemade vanilla ice creamI ordered the Potted Crab...it was small...but delicious (nothing to really complain or rave about) and then the slow roasted pork belly because the waiter suggested it...he said you can get delicious steak anywhere but you can't get really well cooked pork belly anywhere! Let me just say...it was GOOD! (so was the steak...but that's a different matter) and the caramelized peaches...those were meh...I am a fan of this place because they never really rush you for anything and we had a very nice dinner. My friends all loved their dishes and yes...THEY WERE GOOD! I think given another chance...i'd go again! :) (I have nothing really to say about the pub portion downstairs because...I didn't go...but like I said earlier, IT WAS PACKED so I'm assuming it was a great)",

    "text": "Very solid Sunday lunch in an area where I would not expect such a nice pub and dining room. Very nice lambRoast with a good mix of sides. Sticky toffee pudding was excellent. Good wine selection. Can be pricey but there was definitely some extra care over and above a regular pub. Six of us came in two hours early and the wait accommodated us.",

    "text": "I received word about The Princess from across the pond, dutifully bookmarking it for some later relevant date. Since that time I've tried reserving for Sunday lunch several times without success (I've said it before and I'll say it again: all good Sunday roasts in London must be booked in advance.)Then finally one Sunday, just as the clocks had sprung forward, I snagged a \u00a0table for three. Our roasts were bountiful, the meat tender - Yorkshire puds wet on the inside - \u00a0and arrived with lots of veg on the plate: beets, broccoli, carrots and parsnips.Both upstairs and down are bathed in light during the day and the service is pleasant. Guinness is on tap, if you're like me and enjoy a glass of the black stuff with your roast. And thus, The Princess of Shoreditch joins my regular Sunday lunch rotation.",

Great vibe and atmosphere for a chill night out with friends. We grabbed drinks at the bar and waited about 20 minutes for a table. We had the fish and chips, SO DELICIOUS! Our server was pretty attentive. Overall, great experience.",

    "text": "I came here for my work Christmas party this year. The menu sounded promising and so did the location. We had a table for twelve in the upstairs dining area.I had the duck rillettes, the venison and cheese for dessert. The rillettes were nice but not amazing. The venison was overcooked and the brussels sprouts that came with it were really underdone. The cheese was good, but it's hard to screw up cheese.I had a beer when I arrived, but wasn't impressed. We did end up ordering some nice wine to accompany our meal too. I guess my problem was everything was just nice, and not amazing. It was probably better than other pubs I go to and eat at, which is saying something. However, given the hefty \u00a340 pp price of the three course meal, I was really expecting something better. It's as if the chef really wants to be working someplace nicer and is trying to hard. Yes it's a gastropub, but really the flavor and level of cooking should come first, then trying to make it look pretty. And the plating wasn't really even that pretty. My friend ordered the salmon. And if there are cubes of beetroot stacked on a plate, that means it's gourmet right?",

    "text": "Popped in for a few beers with some mates, the downstairs bar is a really nice space with the right amount of chairs and tables. The bar has a decent amount of largers from all over the world (although nothing local!?!?) I wasn't really looking but I don't think the Ale choice is brilliant. There seemed to be a nice choice of spirits and mixers if that's your thing. I also treated the lads to some mixed nuts which were a great accompanyment to the beers. The bar staff were a nice bunch and offered table service..... I'm never too sure about this in London pubs, there's sonthing weird about being served beer at your table in a pub and I'm always suspicious they are going to add an annoying service charge, as we were 1 meter from the bar I played it safe and ordered there.I've eaten upstairs previously and its not bad, probably not as good as they would like to think but above standard pub grub.",

    "text": "If you are visiting from 'merica you must try a Sunday roast. No excuses. This was the most memorable meal I ate while in London. A very hearty meal, best shared with friends and family, will make you one happy person.Skip the Bloody Mary's especially the concoction with beets since its tough to chew a drink. They arrive in a short glass for around five pounds, no garnish, and seem like an afterthought. The Yorkshire pudding were so large my camera recognized it as a face. They are a great vessel for soaking up all the meaty juices left behind. The mixed roast came with pork, beef, and chicken. You can never go wrong with potatoes finished in duck fat. The veggies were perfectly cooked, sweet, and were not part of the dish you push to the side. Great service and a wonderful experience. The sticky toffee ice cream dessert was unnecessary but warranted. This was the tipping point to the inevitable food coma. I wish I had a place like this at home. Cheers to The Princess of Shoreditch.",

Not 10 minutes later, we had a table.The food was good but portions were a bit out of whack. The beef roast was a good-sized piece of meat accompanied by three large potatoes, a good amount of carrots and popover- type biscuit. The hake, had a tiny bit of potatoes, a sauce and nothing else. Hmmm...Wine prices were reasonable, no beer sampled.",
