How often do you see real butchers (with meat hanging up), real bread and cakes being made, real cafe food anymore? Downside is that it is expensive and not really close to any tube (Victoria is about 10 minutes walk).",

    "text": "This place looks beautiful and I had high hopes for the food, but the service was so terrible I'd never go back. To start, the seating system was totally disorganized. My boyfriend and I entered the shop downstairs but the man by the cash register refused to acknowledge our presence. Thinking we needed to go upstairs to be seated, we proceeded to the upper floor only to be completely ignored again. Finally, when we were approached by a server, we asked to sit at the end of one of the long communal tables so we could be adjacent, instead of across a wide table from each other. We were refused on the basis that the ends of tables were reserved for parties of 3 - fair enough. Only, when a second table end cleared right next to where we had been directed to sit and I tried to move over, the host swung by and crossly told me that another party of 3 was coming. Ok, still fair, but no need to be so rude. Then he proceeded to seat TWO people at the end of the table, adjacent to each other. When we pointed this out to him, he essentially said \"tough luck, shit happens\". When a window seat for just 2 people cleared and I asked the waitress if we could move, she told me she'd have to ask her manager, the host. I told her to forget it. I decided that delicious food could make up for it. I ended up ordering a beautiful raw slaw salad that three people around us had ordered. I was pretty excited to eat until, before my own salad arrived, the girl eating the same salad next to me found a SLUG in hers. Yes, all the greens are organic and they dont use any chemicals to keep bugs away. I love this aspect - I was raised by two environmentalists. But organic or not, it is not acceptable to serve people slugs. It is especially unacceptable to not apologize for this, and the waiter just shrugged it off. He offered the girl some free juice (free juice!? how about a free salad???), which was great, but that did not help me enjoy my meal once my own salad arrived. The eggs with salmon and toast that my boyfriend ordered was singularly unimpressive. The salmon was too warm from sitting in the pan it arrived in and the toast was dry. Not going back. Not recommended.",

    "text": "I live about a 2 minute walk from Daylesford and it has been an incredible addition to a neighbourhood which is surprisingly short of places to go for lunch and brunch. Breakfast here is my favourite indulgence, and it does a great varied menu that changes seasonally, relying on its own organic supplies. I would also highly recommend their afternoon tea with two scones which is very well priced. The tables are at the window in a bar form (recommended ) or on a large communal table - this can often be distracting as it's in the middle of the shop and you do have customers walking around constantly. They also do outside seating which is great for a summer's day brunch. Incredible range of fresh pastries and a salad bar, with a very well stocked cheese and meat counter to boot, alongside all their usual products. Upstairs is great for presents (teas, chocolates, organic cleaning products) while downstairs has the wine cellar. The two recent additions are the Daylesford butchers just over the road and their florist (which I find very overpriced) over the square. Great to pop by on a Saturday stroll through the area, always great service.",

It opens at 10 AM on Sunday, and there were a handful of seats open when we arrives ten minutes later. \u00a0We sat upstairs at a two-seater along the windows, next to a shelf of beautiful earthen pots that we eyed.The cafe deserves five starts because first and foremost the food was delicious. Started with a pain au chocolat and friend had croissant with amazing preserves. I had a ginger lemon tea, with fresh lemons and the best honey I've had in a long time (yes I was licking my spoon). I had scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and slices of toast. I never eat toast or eggs straight and both were just phenomenal.The space is bright and country-modern with great light and community feel without being too loud or tight. \u00a0I would have loved to spend time in their market, both with their home goods upstairs and the fresh and prepared foods downstairs.",

    "text": "Located on Pimlico Road near the quaint Orange Square in Chelsea, Daylesford Organic feels like a cozy local hangout. Part market, part cafe, fresh goodies are to be had. But what I think I like the best is it is healthy eating done right. It is not shoved down your throat at how wholesome it all is, it just is delicious food that happens to be good for you.Had a refreshing Saturday brunch on a hot summer afternoon. The place was busy, but the wait was not too long. Very much enjoyed my fluffy scrambled eggs on toast, and fresh squeezed orange juice. What was a little bit of a let down was that the waitstaff, at least upstairs where we sat, was a bit slow and seemed confused as to who was serving which table. We ordered a basket of bread which did not appear until we requested it again -2 more times. It showed up after we were well through half our main courses. Glasses of water were also slow in coming. Other then that the experience was enjoyable.Good wholesome food place.",

    "text": "Daylesford has absolutely the freshest and tastiest meals as well as a great little market downstairs for buying the very same ingredients they made your food with!.I first stopped by here a while back for groceries. The food items, as you would expect, is a little bit pricier than what you'd find in Sainsbury's - but because I was so lazy, I usually stopped by the latter. However, if you're okay with spending a little more cash and buying fresh and locally grown veggies and fruits, delectable cheese, home-baked bread, and grassfed meat, Daylesford Organic is the place to go. It's like a farmer's market sucked into one glorious and vast three-floored food heaven.And as I write this review, I regret not coming here more often to eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, and they even serve food to go at the counter on the ground floor! For that one time I did visit, I ordered a juicy piece of salmon on a bed of squash salad with cranberries. Sounds healthy? You betcha it was! It was a huge bowl so totally worth the value and it just tasted so fresh. I also had the seasonal green which was a tiny little cup with some cooked kale leaves - expensive 4 quids for the little guy but you pay for the quality. My friend had the corn beef with egg, and the mixed greens. Mixed greens was a huge bowl of salad and a yummy light dressing to top it off (more worth it than the seasonal green. His cornbeef meal was cooked in cast iron so woohoo for added iron (it was pretty tasty too albeit not as healthy as my salmon!) To top it all off, we had ginger and honey tea. I had whole bits of stringy ginger in my teapot and a saucer with really fresh honey at the side. The tea itself was all right, not the most flavorful despite the chunk of ginger but I kept nomming on the honey at the side.Also, free wi-fi if you wanted to loiter with your computer over your meal.Arghhhhh why didn't I come here more often before I left London?!",

If you are looking for a sit down meal there are a number of indoor and outdoor seating options. For a light breakfast the tea and bread service of a \u00a0crusty baguette with raspberry preserves and butter is delightful. While I didn't try the eggs Benedict myself, my dining partner thoroughly enjoyed it. For a satisfying lunch meal the three salad option is excellent. Not only is it beautifully presented, depending on the salads selected it will be colorful and unexpected at times with flavor fusion. We had beets, lots of exotic greens, raw veggies, goat cheese and amazing grilled butternut squash...and if its on the menu TRY the Asian inspired salad - its amazing!The soup of the day is always a good option, most recently I had the butternut squash soup and coupled with a baguette it is a meal on its own.Finally, the market for take away cant be beat. The sandwiches are wonderful, the coronation chicken focaccia is divine and the tart or quiche of the day is always a winner. All and all I will keep going back and I think this is a must try stop if you are near Sloan Square",

It's a place you can eat regularly and still enjoy. I would recommend to go there for Saturday lunch as you also get to enjoy the lovely Pimlico Road market. Some of my favourites: their coffee, honey cake, chocolate raspberry tart, pecan tart, grilled meats, eggs benedict or florentine, toast with jam (love thier jam!), they have great streaky bacon, fish dishes.You can get some pretty good premade foods(jn the meal deal) as well, they make really great meatballs, beet soup, cabbage and mash...

When the butter from a local pub in Cambridge blows away the butter from the \"organic natural\" shop there is a small issue.When we ate outside for lunch the food was ok. The breakfast was fine, but there are better options elsewhere in the neighborhood. The coffee was not really that great.We also purchased a few items like milk and meat products from the shop. It was pretty much the same, nothing wrong, but nothing right either.Would not say it is not worth visiting, but I honestly can't recommend highly either.",

If you have been to the original Daylesford Organic farm shop which is in the middle of nowhere (in the Cotswolds, nearest train station Kingham, worth a visit if you have endless supplies of time and money) then to find this cafe in London is like a little countryside haven in itself.However, it is pricey and is a yuppy hide out. I mean, jesus I couldn't count the amount of yummy mummys in white jeans in there, pecking at their food and laughing raucously. I am a big fan of delicious, organic food and you can jolly well indulge in that here. But at a price.I had the lambs liver and mash. That was amazing. Absolutely delicious, I thought the portion looked a bit small but it was so filling and flavoursome and delicious. And then I had the black forest gateau for puds and that just topped everything off. I couldn't move. They have very nice blended teas in here, the Earl grey was veru delicate and finished the meal off nicely. I also once had the mackerel on the summer menu and that was much lighter and very healthy!If you are a fan of good food but don't mind very posh people gaffouing then come here. A meal will set you back \u00a315-20, but it is worth the treat. And as I said, if you are ever in Kingham then go to the real one, they have a deli, a butchers a cheese counter. Amazing.",

So far I am a frequent visitor of organic markets and rather buy organic products and prepare them at home than eat at places serving organic food, because the total price for a family meal gets too high.Last weekend, when I was taking my grandchildren for a Sunday brunch, I decided to treat them with a nice meal at the Daylesford at Pimlico Rd and I was happy that I did it. We splurged on the super green eggs benedict and scrambled eggs with smoked salmon for my grandson and myself and a protein porridgemade from cacao, coconut, walnuts, dates and fresh fruits for my granddaughter. We were very very impressed by the quality of the food, so as the service we received and if we decide we want a quality treat again we would definitely come back. The only reason why Im not giving a five star is the final bill I had to pay and it was not that cheap, but I know that organic farmed and locally-sourced food doesn't come cheap!",

The company's passion for organic, pesticide-free, hormone-free food. The seasonal deli salad was delicious. We loved the home goods market area and items for sale. I would love to take a cooking course. A visit to the farm would also be amazing. They offer a frequent-purchase card for purchases made in the shop over \u00a320. daylesford.com",

It's a wonderful place to grab a cup of coffee, green juice, pastry or food-to-go if you don't have time to dine-in. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would shop and dine there regularly. The breadth and quality of the meat, cheeses, breads and packaged goods was impressive. I wish I'd brought a larger suitcase as I would have filled it full with goods to bring home. I'll always try and stay close to one of their locations when in London so that I can stop in daily.",

Out came the LARGEST bowl of beetroot I have ever seen. Enough for table sharing. It was ENORMOUS. I was not happy and spoke with another wait staff, this time a woman of Eastern European background who was so rude. It's on the menu was all she repeated when I pointed out the \u00a320 was ridiculous. She continued to argue with me that 'it is on the menu'. What is on the menu???? The fact that your waitstaff can't advise someone who isn't that hungry to order something else? Are they in need of money so badly that they ignore having a normal conversation with a patron to steer away from the equivalent of 10 beetroots?? I was told I could take it home. Really? Wow that makes me feel so much better about your crappy staff. They should do better. They should know better. Never giving them my money again. Lousy staff.

I'd never been to Daylesford Organic and as a store, will definitely be going back to pick up some new things. It was white, clean and beautiful with an amazing selection of products.Now the food was beautifully presented and my sister and myself had a lovely evening. However I had higher expectations with the taste of the food - I mean it was good, it was ok but.. the sashimi wasn't very tasteful, the chicken was dry (after they had been talking about how moist it was going to be) and I wasn't gagging to eat more of the dessert. But the supper club was so well done and everything was so beautiful and I mean .. it WAS healthy.. which was the entire point of going there (although I know a lot of places that do healthy REALLY well), so if there was another one I guess I would go back. But then again I'd be excited to try others above this one.I love how all the food is organic and made from their farm. Given their due, it was their first supper club and the chef even said he had never cooked for this many people before. Everyone was very sweet. This is defiantly one to watch! Looking forward to better things to come!",

To be clear; I'm talking about the cafe upstairs, not the shop.The furnishing of the place is nice, sort of akin to one of those furniture shops that has white beds with pink sheets and vintage shabby chic wardrobes with chicken-wire doors. We needed a table for three, and were seated among other people on a long thin table a la Wagamama, I quite like that but it means you need to hope for good eating neighbours. In terms of pricing the food isn't that bad, with smoked salmon, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce on sourdough coming in at \u00a311 or thereabouts, so not awful. That is, until, you get your portion.This place is all about the presentation, and though I appreciate it, it's disappointing when portion size gives way completely to presentation. I ordered scrambled eggs on toast and literally received one long slim slice of toasted sourdough with a pile of scrambled eggs, no butter, no trimmings. Seriously no butter?!Also, to add to my irritation, our, and everyone else's drinks arrived without spoons. Unhelpful if you put sugar in your coffee, or to stir your milk into your tea. I asked a server about spoons, I was told they're coming as they're all in the wash. Ten mins later they checked on our food and we were told again, spoons will be here soon, they're still in the wash. They never arrived. We stirred the drinks with our knives.Overall, this place has great potential but it lacked the attention to detail needed and the substance to make it worthy of the prices.",

Since we arrived at 12 PM, the breakfast stuff had already mostly stopped, so we each ordered a salad, which sets you back 11.50 each. I also had wanted chicken with mine, which the waiter totally forgot, but it was a blessing in disguise because it would have been another 10 pounds for that. The panzanella salad I had was also so awful. The bread was completely soggy, and all the vegetables looked and felt wilted. It was nowhere near enough food, and we both still felt peckish, so I ordered a fresh juice, and that was 6 pounds. During this whole time, I didn't manage to get any water, because the staff were never around and hadn't brought it around in the first instance. I can't think of a single enjoyable thing about this meal. The bright, airy interior looks like an Ottolenghi, but the food and service fail to even hold a candle.",

    "text": "Let's start with this: the food here is really, really tasty. It is. It's well-seasoned, it's clearly of a great quality, and the ingredients are top-notch.Let's end with this: after we got our appetisers, we waited /one hour/ because our order for burgers was forgotten. Twice. At that point, we were more angry than hungry, especially as we got to watch table after table be seated, eat, and go while we waited, yet again, in the hopes of eating something. In the end, we managed to snag the manager and, about twenty minutes later, actually got our burgers, but 1.5 hours and that much bungling really doesn't make either of us eager to return.",
