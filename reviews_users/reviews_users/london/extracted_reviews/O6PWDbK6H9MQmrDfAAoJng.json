The menu is stylistically like that of its sister Arbutus and just as competently executed: fresh, simple fare, daintily presented, creative but not remotely eccentric. There's a lot more atmosphere and intimacy than Arbutus, thanks to the wood panelled, dark interior. The cheeseboard is first-rate. We had impeccable service. The waiter showed enthusiasm, real expertise about cheese and a clear passion for it, and his appearances at the table were timely. The wine list is thoughtful and interesting, and the prices very reasonable considering what they're like in London. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "My mother and I came straight from a weekend in Paris to lunch at Wild Honey, toting luggage and in casual travel clothes. \u00a0Two concerns should be immediately apparent. \u00a0First, would we be judged for looking a proper mess? \u00a0Second, would the food be palatable after all the divine eats Paris had to offer?Thankfully, the answers were no, and yes, in that order. \u00a0The ambience, at least for lunch, was relaxed, and the service was helpful and courteous throughout. \u00a0The food managed to please our spoiled taste buds as well.The space is charming, very classic and dark-wood, but with whimsical artwork lightening up the walls and atmosphere. \u00a0I was afraid I would feel unrelaxed based on reviews, but it felt casual and leisurely enough. \u00a0I can see how the personality of the place might change with sundown, though, so maybe hold the denim shorts for dinner.Wild Honey offers a prix fixe 3-course lunch for \u00a318.95 with two options for each course. \u00a0My mother and I went with prix fixe and a la carte and shared, as I was set on trying a specific dessert.We ordered the gazpacho appetizer, the risotto of smoked eel, and the classic custard tart from the prix fixe menu, and the organic salmon and wild honey ice cream a la carte.The gazpacho was a zesty refreshing bowl of orange-red interspersed with green peas and alfalfa sprouts. \u00a0The soup itself was a balanced blend of red pepper and tomato with a nice dice of onion, very flavorful and very good. \u00a0The \"Loch Duart\" salmon with Jersey Royal potatoes and young market vegetables (peas, fava beans, carrots, beets, leeks, purslane) was simply cooked and gently sauced with pleasant results. \u00a0The bright green risotto of smoked eel with sorrel and sour cream, on the other hand, was not good. \u00a0The menu as written suffered from something of a lack of detail, and it failed to mention that the entire dish was drowned in pork fat. \u00a0My mother doesn't eat pork and said she wanted to spit out the first bite. \u00a0I love pork in all its forms, though, and even I found the stench overwhelming. \u00a0The eel didn't help much, as it was oversmoked to the point of acridity, somehow emphasizing the general aura of bacon in the dish. \u00a0If this sounds good to you, trust me, I heart bacon. \u00a0This was too much.Dessert was another story and deserves its own paragraph. \u00a0The classic custard tart that sounded so boring on the prix fixe menu was absolutely fantastic. \u00a0The first thing we noticed was its seductive wiggle as our server put it down on the table. \u00a0It came on a thin crust served with plump juicy soaked raisins. \u00a0The taste impressed with flavors of gingerbread mixed with the light cold creaminess of the custard, enhanced all the more by the raisins. \u00a0The wild honey ice cream with crushed honeycomb lit up every tasting nerve in my head. \u00a0Three shapely quenelles on a small bed of crunchy honeycomb - simple, elegant, phenomenal. \u00a0This was one of the best desserts of our London trip, and one of the best I've ever had. \u00a0The fact that my mother actually preferred the custard tart should indicate its high caliber as well. \u00a0Do not skip dessert at this restaurant.I left Wild Honey happy with the sweet bold taste of honey playing on my tongue. \u00a0Even with the misstep of the fat-drenched risotto, the meal was great. \u00a0For a Michelin-starred restaurant, prices were also reasonable, especially the prix fixe. \u00a0I would highly recommend this place to anyone living nearby, and might even consider going back for that ice cream on a future trip.",

I chose the fish appetiser and the fish main, which came with the delicious green risotto. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly; very flavorful. I think the risotto had quite a bit of cream, but it was good and hey, you have to splurge on the calories once in a while. The cheese course was nice and the jam very tasty.

The interior of Wild Honey is simple but stylish, with sleek polished wooden tables and soft upholstered seating.  Like Arbutus, a key objective is the use of the freshest ingredients according to season to produce high quality, well planned out dishes, but at a good price. The menu is constantly changing according to the availability of the ingredients. Anything they cook with pork I tend to order. I just can not resist, especially when pork belly is on the menu as they cook it slowly, ensuring the meat is succulent and simply melts into your mouth with every bite.Also, like Arbutus, you can have any wine you want served in 250ml carafes, which means you don't have to indulge in a whole bottle each time you want to try out \u00a0different wine.They do a delicious 3 course lunch menu for \u00a316.95 and a 3 course set dinner for \u00a318.95.

The decor is not very welcoming though as the place is quite dark and the wood panels make the room more reminiscent of a library in Cambridge than a contemporary restaurant in Mayfair. Not much buzz, the place is quiet but lacks atmosphere I thought. They have a small set menu at \u00a316.5 which sounds like good value, otherwise lunch with 2 courses plus water plus coffee is around \u00a335. In summary a decent venue for a business lunch but I am not sure I will be back as I cant think of a really good reason to do so.",

    "text": "I do love a bit of fine dining but don't go too often, mainly because the cost is so prohibitive. I love the food and wine but do baulk a bit at paying \u00a380/\u00a3100/... a head too frequently. There are more cost effective ways to eat at such establishments though as most provide set lunches of some description, handy for ladies that lunch but not ideal if you have to work office hours as I do. We needed somewhere to dine yesterday though as a colleague is leaving and so decided to give one a go. Being based in Mayfair the choice is fairly large but we decided upon Wild Honey, a Michelin starred establishment from the same stable as Arbutus, a Soho establishment known for great value fine dining. At \u00a318.95 for 3 courses for lunch it seemed a bargain, even if drinking was obviously going to have a fairly negative effect upon the bill. You have to sacrifice a bit for these set lunches with a reduced choice (two options per course) and a reduced portion size too, not that it was too obvious with the dessert. Our choices were potato soup or pork slices with apple puree for starter, Cornish mullet with potato gnocchi or lasagna of veal shoulder for main and a pain perdu with seville marmalade or a portion of Brie de Meaux for dessert. Starting off we all went for pork, as nice as I'm sure their potato soup would be it was just never going to compete with four men at the table. The dish was rolled belly pork, braised and then sliced very thinly. Apple puree provided some tart sweetness and the baby herbs some pepperiness. As much as there things to like about this dish, such as the beautiful texture and the apple puree, I was a little disappointed all told. The meat was bland in parts with the seasoning concentrated in spots, one mouthful was woefully underseasoned with the next an explosion of salt in the mouth. It was nice, don't get me wrong, but nothing too special. Again the meat won for the second course with four orders of the lasagna of veal shoulder. Whilst more a ragu between two sheets of pasta, constructed post cooking rather than baked, this was nothing short of amazing. Without a doubt the finest ragu and pasta to ever pass my lips. The pasta was delicately thin but still toothsome. The ragu was rich, meaty and seasoned to perfection, melt in the mouth veal with cubes of vegetables which at first resisted the squash of the tongue against the palate (there was really no need to go so far as chewing) before giving way in a little burst of sweetness. Superlative. No one was too keen on brie, de Meaux or not, so we made a pact to share a proper cheeseboard after our dessert and kept up the theme by all ordering the pain perdu, seville marmalade. The pain perdu (eggy bread) was good but not perfect. Everything stuffed in the mouth at once Masterchef judge style made for a pleasant dessert, the sweet ice cream and bread being a good foil to the bitter seville orange. The pain perdu on its own though had a bit of a bitter taste, as if over caramelised I think. A slightly tough bottom edge suggested a little overcooking on one side too. There wasn't a scrap left on any of our plates by the end though which says something. The cheeseboard was an on display affair, sat proudly in the middle of the restaurant right behind us and I got the pleasure of choosing. We had a bleu d'Auvergne, a Montgomery's cheddar, Epoisse and then another blue and another washed rind whose names completely evade me now. All were fine examples, nutty for the washed rind, fantastically mature for the cheddar and smooth and salty for the blue. Throughout the meal we were also given masses of very good sourdough bread, so much that I had to stop taking it after a while. With two bottles of wine between four and cheese it came in about \u00a340 a head, a step up from the \u00a316 food bill but not bad for food like this, when they got it right that is. It has definitely made me want to go back and give the a la carte menu a go, something I think would only add maybe \u00a320 a head to the bill, which thinking how impressive some of the mains around us were looking doesn't sound too bad at all.

The beef was tough to the point of also being inedible - it struck me that the cut of beef needed to be cooked longer and in a very different manner to help break it down. \u00a0I mentioned the veal to the waiter when he was running the credit card (and asked how the meal was for the first time). The manger did follow up as we left.Shame really, nice interior and great location. I will stick with Bellamy's (they were closed).",

    "text": "Wild Honey was the first place I went upon arriving in London. After seeing that it had received a Michelin star in the past, and it's sinfully yummy-looking menu, I was sold. Between the not-so-friendly hostess and completely unorganized/inexperienced servers behind the bar, I would say that they could probably stand to improve a bit in the service realm. But the food was delicious, and very flavorful across the board. I did the prix fixe with a glass of red recommended by the staff. Though I couldn't tell you what the wine was, I do know he chose well for my food selections. To start, I had the eel and chicken terrine with a fruit relish to balance the saltiness -- it was absolutely delicious. So tasty, and definitely my favorite part of the meal. I was curious to try the ox tongue with polenta, and upon first bite was pleasantly surprised. As I continued eating though, I realized after the first few bites that the greens were terribly over-salted, and the creaminess of the ox and polenta left my tongue screaming for something to cut the richness a bit. Very tasty, but just too much, and my main reason for not giving a full 5 stars. And to finish, the meringue with custard could only be facetiously described by an American as a marshmallow flavored soup. Good, but not my usual cup of tea for dessert. As far as ambiance, I did enjoy the establishment itself, though the bar is situated along the main, narrow walkway into the back dining room, which is bothersome. I was also noticeably in the minority, as the only female patron I saw for a good while. Interesting, though not unsettling. Clearly a great place for business lunches. I wouldn't make it a priority to return, personally.",

The servers were not very attentive so for example we had to chase the bread and we were asked multiple times as to whether we were looking to order drinks. The place wasn't that busy but the service lacked the joined up-ness that you would expect at these prices. The dessert selection of petit fours were delicious as was the honeycomb ice cream. The wine list offered not a great deal at the more reasonable end of the spectrum - in the case of the reds just a few wines at \u00a330 before ascending to aGeorgian wine and a Romanian wine that many would know nothing about, before hitting the near \u00a360 price bracket. It is not for a second that we had a bad meal, more that I was possibly expecting more and didn't get it.",

Not sure why this place has a Michelin star the food was cold (3 courses, the pork belly starter, the plaice and the cod) and undercooked (artichoke).The main redeeming feature was the service, the host was very apologetic and took money off the bill. Whilst she was very keen to try and persuade us to come back the clincher was when she finished by saying come back when 2 specific chefs were working as that is when we would have a better food experience. Sorry but if you are a Michelin starred restaurant shouldn't all your chefs be able to cook?",

I for one was happy to find wild honey ice cream on honey crumble on the dessert menu after a delicious meal of game.

I'm used to my restaurants being a bit more scruffy, and I am a bit of a scruff-bag anyway so when I walked into this grownup, sophisticated room I felt a bit out of place for a second, but the staff were all very welcoming and friendly. Our table wasn't ready so we sat at the bar, ordered champagne and people watched. I took a look around and decided that this was a very elegant place. The walls are all dark oak panelled, and modern art is dotted around. There are a few dark comfy booths, which due to the size of our party, we were able to take. The food was modern British eclectic, definitely haute cuisine. Because I am a penniless little scruff-bag, I was relieved to see that there is a 3 course set menu for 16.95. I had a carrot veloute for a starter which came with toasted hazelnuts \u00a0and olives, and a smoked eel risotto for a main. The portions certainly aren't large, but I made up for that by diving for the bread basket a couple of times. Dessert was cheese from the large cheeseboard which makes up the centre of the room. I thought my meal was delicious, but I wish the menu was slightly more affordable so that I could check out the other dishes. Or I wish I was richer, one or the other would be good.",

My dad had veal with caramelized onions and spelt, and he also really loved his entree. My last note is that the Wild Honey Ice Cream with crushed honeycomb is divine.

    "text": "I took my Mama here for Mother's Day dinner. The way I feel I can sum up this restaurant is through song lyrics. The song that plays in 'Pulp Fiction' of \"Girl, you'll be a woman soon\". This is the best way to design the cuisine of Wild Honey. It is going through puberty and is working past the feelings of being embarrassed if someone says the word \"mastication\" but meets more of an eye roll and the wanting to feel more grown up. Yet there is still a slight infantile element to how things are expressed. Yet a desire to be viewed as a grown up, but one with spots and braces. I felt the service in this place was a disappointment and not what you would expect from a Michelin starred establishment. Firstly they were a bit vague about my reservation so already we were off to a slightly clunky start. Next point of issue was asking for drinks. I felt we were being rushed a bit and there wasn't the greatest sense of hospitality in place and a rushed feeling for us to have decided what we wanted to eat within seconds of looking at the menu. The third thing that annoyed me was the way the bread was presented and served. It was literally big slightly asymmetrical slices of either white or brown sour dough that you grabbed from a basket they offered you. There was no nice spoon and fork way of serving the bread. Maybe I sound a bit of a pedant but in a Michelin starred place I like there to be a nice way to greet people and a slightly more eloquent way of presenting and serving the bread. If it means I am a bread bully then so be it. There also wasn't an amuse bouche but an emerging unamused boy. I know which one I would opt for. To start with I had a guinea fowl and foie gras boudin blanc. This was served with a small salad and some intensely and delicately cut vegetables. I loved it. There was a nice mixture of textures, all the flavours balanced and I felt myself wanting more. It was also reasonably priced. My beloved had the smoked eel with a smoked turnip and alphonso mango puree Mother had the pork belly with snails. Both of their dishes displayed some wonderful technical skills, great flavours, fantastic seasoning but it wasn't anything that left me feeling that there was a great culinary flare in place. This gut instinct was confirmed when we had our mains. My Mother and I had the rabbit which was served two ways which consisted of two discs of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and cooked with rabbit liver on the inside. This lacked a certain sweetness and left me with a rather bitter aftertaste which over powered the delicacy of the rabbit. The vegetables were wonderful as well as the saddle of rabbit that was slow cooked with this. There was also interesting flavour and texture offered from having olives and hazelnuts cooked with them. The sauce had a good depth of flavour too but was a bit greasy. It was almost split yet tasted nice so I will forgive that. But there were some technical errors such as one of the two discs being slightly undercooked and a slight lack of umami. There would be no foodgasm for me tonight. My partner ordered the rose veal which was served with soft polenta and some slightly unidentifiable cabbage/kale. It was nicely cooked but just bland. She found it uninspiring. I found looking at it to be a bit depressing. It was like Monday morning on a plate. Mother wasn't overly impressed with hers nor was I with mine. I also found the way the waiting staff leaned over us a bit excessive and it lacked a finesse. Perhaps they need to watch Albert Roux Jr's programme 'Service' to learn a trick or two...failing that a whole new staff training manual. That would be my suggestion. There was a wonderful wine list but a slight lack of sommelier. But I will give Wild Honey some credit and that is you can buy wine by the carafe as well as bottle and the prices aren't too much of a smack in the mouth. The selection available is very comprehensive and there is something on there to suit every taste and budget. We decided with dessert to sample a little of what they had to offer. I opted for a glass of Ice Cider and my partner chose some Tokaji in a taster size. Well that's what we ordered. The waiter seemed a bit perplexed that we were ordering in such a way but at the same time if you have those types of options available to customers on the menu then be prepared for such a request. When it arrived we realised how generous the dessert wine 'taster' size was. Take Note: Order taster size if you are having dessert wine there as you will save cash and have the right amount of the wine to have with your dessert. There was a slight error initially in the fact that we had all the same wine but to their credit they rectified it promptly. For desserts we shared the wild honey ice cream and honeycomb as well as a pear clafoutis with custard. The ice cream was delicately made and had a gentle flavour. Only that mixed with honeycomb in theory",

After all a professional inspector gave the place a prestigious award after numerous visits. But then I remind myself to rate within its category. The category Wild Honey is in is restaurants awarded one Michelin Star. Long story short, Wild Honey is great and presents my kind of menu and I'd love to come back here on any occasion. The menu features locally sourced food obtained in what appears to be a sustainable manner. I enjoyed the line caught mackerel but thought the presentation and other components on the dish were a bit off. How dressed up can mackerel served cold be? Norfolk hare was wild and came with a warning that it, along with the other game could contain shot in it. There is something intriguing about thinking how the animal you are about to eat was hunted in the wild as opposed to raised on a farm. I could definitely taste the difference between this rabbit and the farm raised variety; so much more flavor. The hare was cooked perfectly and spaetzle with veg in it accompanied the protein well. The only disappointment was the wild honey comb ice cream. Somehow the honey combs were crisped. The combs and ice cream left a bad taste on my pallet. At Wild Honey its all about the food on the plate and the food is what I enjoy most.",

No words can properly describe it - and that's coming from an ice cream connoisseur!I had the beef, which was delicious. My parents each had fish - cod and sea bass - and both were also well presented and tasty. Our appetizers - a mix of salads and soups were all nice portions and worthy of the price/Michelin star.My only gripe is that the service is a bit slow, but you are in Britain after all!

    "text": "What a delightful little restaurant. Anthony Demetre's cosy venture, tucked away at the east-end of Mayfair is a refreshing change to the often pretentious chique of French establishments in this part of London. Instead of pompous, stiff waiters who you normally pay to look down on you throughout the meal, the front of house at Wild Honey are friendly, relaxed yet sufficiently attentive. Wild Honey feels very British from the moment you enter the dark Oak-panelled dining room. It looks like the club house of a gentlemen's shooting club. Come to think of it, hanging carcasses wouldn't look out of place here (and would be a welcome replacement to the questionable modern-art on the walls). We opted for the set menu, which at \u00a318 for three courses is surely one of the best-value Michelin lunches in the capital. The a la carte is also reasonably priced but all set-menu dishes appealed on this visit. A starter of sliced pork and apple puree with capers was light and refreshing and a main of roast chicken with gnocchi and chanterelles was packed with flavour and accompanied by a deliciously rich sauce. To finish, a classic Pain Perdu was cooked perfectly with tasty, light bread and the right balance of sweetness in the sauce. Coffee here was excellent but does not come with petit fours. In fact no freebies were offered throughout the meal which was slightly disappointing but not surprising given the price.The wine selection is relatively small but well-priced with mark-ups around 100%. Chakana Torrontes from Argentina for example was \u00a319.50 instead of \u00a38-\u00a39 in most shops. Overall, this was a very enjoyable meal and I shall be back soon to try the famous Bouillabaisse.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant on Yelp, not reading any of its history. I made a reservation for one, since I was traveling solo and needed motivation to leave my hotel :) This is French-European style cooking, so there's lots of butter. I sat down and was served green olives, my absolute favorite food. I knew I wanted a wine, and I couldn't decide. The bartender was more than happy to help with my decision, and in fact helped me to pick one of the best wines I've ever had. Then the bread and butter came - of course this did not disappoint.For my main course, I ordered the Turbot. It had a pureed broccoli spread on the side that was so innovated and tasty. The portion was just enough for me, but if you have a bigger appetite, you may want a starter or a heartier entree.I always have room for dessert, so I ordered the raspberry souffle with lemon gelato. \u00a0It was so light and fluffy, with just the right hint of flavor and sweetness. I had to beg the waitress to take it away so I wouldn't finish it.I would come back here over and over again. The fact that it had a Michelin star previously made me wonder why they still don't! Service, Food, Decor, Drinks, and overall Experience were all impeccable.",

The waiter struck just the right balance of being attentive without suffocating. The food was delicious and creative. They've found novel ways to kick traditional fare up a notch. The wine list is exceptional (although several bottles were well beyond our budget). The space has a window at the front, which lends a bit of light to the moody, charming interior. I was truly touched by the small samples the waiter brought from the kitchen too. When I joked in passing I couldn't fit any dessert, he brought a small plate of chocolate treats anyway.

Before coming to the restaurant I spent a week around the area and almost thought British food is only about fish and chips - wrong. This place offers impeccable sophisticated food.We ordered salmon as an appetizer. It was melting in my mouth. I only wish the portion would be endless. As main entrees we ordered roast saddle and braised shoulder of rabbit, white beans, aubergine and Bouillabaisse 'traditional Marseille style. The rabbit was so juicy and so tasteful. It came with French style baked potatoes and that \u00a0one was probably \u00a0the best in my life.Bouillabaisse 'traditional Marseille style had really fresh fish and the portion was generous. What was special about this entree is that they bring you fish and vegetables on one plate and souses and soup separately and you can make it how you prefer.Not to mention that the selection of wine they offer is tremendous. You can get a bottle of nice French/Spanish wine starting at $30 or about 18 pounds. The also have a great selection of cheese.We finished our night with their out of control honey ice cream and raspberry warm cake with ice cream. I was in heaven after trying both.I recommend going \u00a0for their special, which is \u00a322.50 and you get one appetizer, entree and dessert. That deal is great and I only wish I would see it before we ordered food:)The only reason why the place is getting 4 stars is the service. Our waiter was not warm at all and would never follow up with us on our orders. However, there was another nice waiter who was so kind to offer free cheese and crackers to our daughter. If you want to go for some good food in London this place is definitely one of them.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I plan to go back to Wild Honey as I feel I might have just hit it on a bad day. My expectations were very very high when I walked in for lunch and was greeted by the friendly hostess. I am a HUGE fan of Arbutus, its Boho chic sister restaurant in Soho. Wild Honey feels like the successful older brother with the office job. The Mayfair space is more on the traditional side, yet not stuffy, perhaps a sort of more youthful take on classic. I loved the brasserie style bar you pass as you walk in on your way to the tables in the back. The tables were very close together, and I think here is where I started to feel a bit put off. Once you squeeze in (nearly knocking the drink of person at the table next to you), you realize you are practically sitting with the people next to you. You can hear their entire conversation, try as you might to block out the fact that they can't decide whether to go on holiday in Australia or go skiing in Switzerland and whether or not the children's nanny should come along too and if so is it OK for her to fly economy while the family is in Club class. Oh dear. If that wasn't enough they had to have a lengthy discuss between themselves whether or not it would be ok to have a glass of wine with lunch or if that might upset the pre holiday diet. I found the menu a similar continental flair, yet a bit more fussy, to the one at Arbutus. I ordered a starter that was unremarkable, and then a fish dish which was quite good, yet somehow lacking. I might have ordered wrong in the sense that I was probably more in the mood for meat since when I saw the plate of the person across from me it looked incredibly tantalizing. On that note I will say, go check it out as I plan to go again. Watch this space for an update...",
