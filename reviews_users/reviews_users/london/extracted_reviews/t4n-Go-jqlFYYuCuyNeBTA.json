    "text": "This was the first pub I hit on my first trip to London. It was one of the more inviting looking places and in a great location right in the heart of Shepherd Market. I naturally had to try the fish and chips, especially since their sign out front talked up a big game when it came to that particular meal. It was a pretty mellow place that night but the food was good and they had a TV with sports on it which made it nice for the solo diner. The service was slightly above average when compared to some of the surrounding pubs, not the best but definitely not the worst. Rather than writing a review on my first British pub on my first night in town, I decided to hit several others first to get some context and I'm glad I did. I probably would have been overly generous had I not done it that way but at the same time, it held its ground against pretty much any of the other pubs I hit so while I cannot rave about it being the greatest place in the world, it also did not disappoint. I would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "Bucket List: London Pub - CheckLast night in London so we wanted to check out a good solid London Pub. Great find!After Dinner and some drinks at Mr. Kong (Best Chinese food ever had), we decided to hit up a pub for some more drinks. Great Idea on clear , crisp night. Kings Arm is located close to the Green Park Underground station (2-3 blocks away). It is down a back ally, which is kinda scary, but it is exactly what you think of when you think of the London Streets, dark, kinda scary, but lined with inviting food and drink places!Kings Arm is a small place, not sure if there is an upstairs, but the Pub is downstairs (ground floor). You def get the warm and cozy feeling when you walk in, everyone was talking, having a good time, even the bartenders. They were nice and courteous, even to two American tourists. They had about 4 beers on draft and several wine selections on top of the full bar. Selection wise Not over the top but decent. The beer, mixed drinks and wine were all good and fresh tasting. The crowd was great too, a whole mix of students, tourists and locals. \u00a0We arrived after the kitchen had closed so I cant speak to the food, but the beers, atmosphere and location were killer. I would def. go back in a heart beat. Note: Alot of bars close at 11pm during the week. For Americans that's crazy, but just beware. Dong Dong! Was that Big Ben or Last call... either way another round on me! See you at the bar.",

Saying this place is a solid English pub is like visiting a Starbucks and saying you've been to a solid, authentic coffee house or Chipotle and saying you've been to an authentic taqueria. It's a Taylor Walker and if you spend more than an hour in London you'll quickly realize that they're a big chain who seem to have a pub on every corner. The beer selection was fairly modest with Doom being perhaps the most interesting offering on tap (and that's no saying much). The food was pretty uninspired. Really, the decor is the only thing going for this place.",

The punchbowl (my 1st choice) was closed, Lion was packed with same reception group, ended up walking down the street and found Kings Arms. The service was very friendly, though the kichen was super slow. Maybe because they were closing kichen in 15 minutes, but could be faster. Our waitress was very friendly and fun to chat with, drink was served very fast. The location is in the Mayfair, not too near or far from all touristy things. Also the area is packed with many food venues who stay open late, so if you were like me, missing the kichen close at Kings, then head over to a pizza place, have a lice, and come back for another round of happy time. I will go back there again for raid back time.",

My friend and I stopped by a few places in the area, but since it was a Sunday night, the neighborhood was quite, and we being tourists and all, didn't want to intrude.We ended up at Kings Arms because there was a decent crowd in there, mostly locals but I'd say one table of European tourists. Although there were not more seats left on the first floor, we decided to stay in the warm and lively bar area and study the menu. The bar-tenders and the manager (or some kind of owner/supervisor person) were very friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere was nice.As we finally sat down, we decided to go with the cliche and order a large fish n chips to share and some bread and butter on the side. Maybe I just like food so much that I'd fall for anything, but the huge piece of fried cod had me convinced. It was fresh and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Although it wasn't my first time in London, Kings Arms definitely felt like a warm neighborhood welcome.",

I certainly didn't come from LA to eat burgers or burritos in a local pub. The lager was cold and tasty and the berry cider was a unique twist and very good. We had fish and chips and they were pretty average (which may be a function of fish and chips, so....) and steak and ale pie. The pie was about what I'd expected, very hard, tasteless crust around a bit of beef stew- again, nothing special (again, that might just be what a steak and ale pie is). Every other meat pie I've had has been very bland and tasteless, too.If you want to eat at a traditional British pub, I'm pretty sure you won't find any that distinguishes themselves from the others as far as the pub comfort food goes. At $40GBP for two meals and a beer and a cider, it's about what should be expected in central London.Shepherds Market is a fun little pocket in Mayfair that begs more exploration.",

We left a returned about 20 mins to get a table for my family. Order at the bar for your drinks. Menu varied. Enjoyed the chicken mushroom pie, fish and chips and jacket potato. In the US we call that baked potato. Friendly service. Freshly prepared food. Average prices for the Mayfair area. Would return. Place emptied out once football over. And by football I mean soccer.",

Anyway, since I could only pick one of them I decided that I would pick this one and, well, it was okay but I can't say that it was hugely inspiring. Like many of the London pubs it doesn't have a beer garden (or a rooftop deck) so you basically have to walk past all the smokers congregating at the front door. Also the ground floor bar was pretty crowded when I was here, but fortunately they do have a second floor, and for some reason, when I went up there, it was basically empty, even though the bar was staffed. Okay, there was a good range of beers on tap, including some craft beers (or ales to be more precise) however it wasn't anything that I could say was hugely fantastic.",

Service is non-existent which means you go to the bartender, place your order and they bring your food to you, no follow up if you need anything else. \u00a0This requires some adjusting and learning local customs especially coming from the US where we take customer service seriously.So we ordered a plate of Fish & Chips and a local ale to try. \u00a0The fish was tasty, nothing spectacular and the chips were average. \u00a0The food wasn't mind blowing, didn't tantalize the taste buds.....just okay.",
