It was nice seeing the owner with his red headcloth standing at the door as well!Karage is a good item to order, juicy, succulent fried chicken. They don't serve this in the first branch on St Giles. 3 pieces of chicken per dish.Green tea comes in little red or black teapots (one pot per person)Charshu Men comes with so much pork and is for those who likes a non spicy soup base.I got the Gekikara which is pretty spicy, comes with charshu and also minced meat. Eggs must be ordered separately for Charshu Men and Gekikara and they are worth the order. Went for hard noodles but the star of the show here aren't the ramen, but the meat and eggs :)Service is pretty good. Happy days.",

    "text": "This is some of the best Tonkotsu-based Ramen I had in my life. It had very deep flavor and almost palpable thickness to it, the pork slices were silky-soft, and the egg was just cooked while still being runny. If it needs to be translated to Bay Area dialect, on the level of Ramen Dojo minus the long lines. I would still give a nod to Orenchi, but there one could as well wait for the title character from Becket's play. As for the price - this part of London is not exactly known for bargains, so my advice is either to clench one's teeth and pay, or go to Pret-a-Manger and \u00a0(almost) not pay. If there a way to get both quality and price, please post it on Yelp or call your doctor, because it may lead to an unsafe drop in blood pressure",

Fyi: i traveled to japan annually for a while and have a good reference point. Pork was hard, again, not using proper technique. It should be melt in your mouth, but this needed chewing. Broth was actually pretty decent, i got the spicy one. The truffle edamame was really bad. I enjoy edamame to the point i make it at home (super easy). These were overcooked which meant the skin doesnt stay in form and the beans are way too soft so overall texture very bad. Truffle salt was uneven. I actually didnt even finish this. Coke with ice was the highlight, as was the service. They were cheerful and attentive.",

The v-shape of the bowl was deceiving as to how much it held. I was surprised that it had more than I thought. I liked it a lot but I thought it could be better if the broth was served steaming hot and the slices of pork belly were not cold. spicy yuzu ramen \u00a312.00 (with regular noodles) - this was my favourite, not least because I do like spicy food. While the original tonkutsu can be porky, the citrus tang of the yuzu cuts through the porkiness of this broth and as you plough through the bowl, it gets spicier and spicier. The heat is gentle but slowly kicking in and though it is spicy, it does not numb the tastebuds. The meat served in this bowl has less fat but again the meat was cold and the broth could have been a tad warmer.chicken karaage \u00a34.00 - boneless crispy chicken that is not too oily, not too greasy and not dried out from the frying. The mayonnaise on the side was a nice touch - although the fried chicken did not need it - but just not quite enough for all the pieces. matcha swirl ice-cream \u00a34.00 - after a bowlful of noodles with one side dish, this portion of matcha ice-cream was just right to share between two but I stongly urge you not to. It was delicious; not too sweet and did not quickly melt away. Rated my second best matcha ice-cream in London so you would understand why I was so selfish as to not share. Kanada-ya does holds the spot as my favourite ramen place in London. It was a good, satisfying meal at a reasonable price. With the dessert, I felt that my meal in Kanada-ya was complete and wholesome. Looking forward to going back soon!",

We booked a table easily online (which is great because so many places just make you queue!). The staff was friendly and nice throughout the meal and we never lacked for anything (water, condiments...).Now, the interesting part, the one you are all waiting for... The food! Truffle ramen (\u00a314) smells like truffle even from across the table. Very apetising! Both my flatmates chose to have it with an egg as a topping - it was delicious (yes I did taste it). The egg especially was amazing apparently (I did not taste it sadly, but they ordered an extra one so I guess it was worth it!). I ate a Gekikara (\u00a313). Spicy, flavourful, with hard noodles (you can choose if you want the noodles hard, extra hard, medium or soft). The special thing with the Gekikara is the tantan minced pork (the ball you see on my bowl), which is soft and nice and spicy and tasty. Very good food. Tiny bit expensive for ramen, but that's the case (almost) everywhere in London and was to be expected so close to the centre. Also portions not huge - we had kaedama (extra noodles for \u00a32).",

We chose a booth but you need to be careful, some of them are a little uneven when it comes to how much space between table and bench seat back, my coworker had plenty of room on her side, me? Not so much...However, we weren't here for the seats, we were here for the noodles and the noodles were great! No offer of thick or thin noodles, just how hard they are cooked. But the Tonkotsu ramen is great. Not that happy that egg is an additional extra but you do need to get it. Most places have it as standard unless you are getting a lunch special. Here, it's an optional extra. However the broth and noodles themselves are beautiful.We got the chicken karaage as well and this was a lot larger than expected. Hot succulent fried chicken served in a little metal bucket. We had to wait for it as the first one ended up on the floor while being delivered to us, but accidents happen. No big deal, they let us know immediately and everything was fine.I'd go again, it's a little expensive for lunch and there are SO many ramen shops around now (two in this little street alone). Maybe dinner, but like the other branch this gets SO busy.",

More importantly, the manager and staff were extremely rude and patronising. \u00a0When we were seated, they bluntly told us you are just going to have to share a table (with two other guests) as if we were a nuisance. \u00a0When we enquired later if we would have a friend join us (as there were two other empty tables), instead of simply saying no they told us they were cancelling our order and asked us to leave to table to stand outside - my friend being 8 months pregnant (!). \u00a0We said we'd stay instead and the manager look put out. In all my years of dining I've never experienced such appalling service. I'm afraid we will never return; there are much better ramen options in London.",

    "text": "Wish I could give it 4.5. It's one of the best (if not the best) bowls of ramen in London so I've rounded it up to 5. I've eaten at Bone Daddies, Shoryu and Ippudo and only Ippudo can even come close. Love that you can request noodle hardness based on personal preference and that they have little help yourself dishes of mustard greens and pickled ginger at every table, reminds me of Japan. With the opening of this second branch of Kanada-Ya 6 months ago, it helps to alleviate the burden on their flagship (never not seen a line in front of it). The great thing about this one being so new, is that most people don't know about it. So, we were able to stroll in on a rainy Saturday at 7pm with no wait to get a booth large enough for 4, for the two of us. The seating is across two floors with some tables in the basement for approximately 20-30 and another 30 upstairs in square and round booths as well as counter seating. We had a look at the menu and decided to have the sake (salmon) onigiri (2 pieces for \u00a34.25) along with our ramen. They came to the table warm (definite plus) and the rice was nicely cooked and the furikake added some additional umami to the onigiri. The salmon was good and I just wished there was more of it. Balanced ratio of rice to salmon for an onigiri, but I'm just greedy :)I decided to order the Gekikara (\u00a313) which was served with spicy 'tan tan' style minced pork, pork belly chashu, wood ear fungus, seaweed and fresh spring onion. I also opted to add on a Hanjuku Egg (\u00a32). Adam decided to get the Tonkotsu X (\u00a310.50) which was promoted as only available in London and was a mix of their famous pork broth with a chicken broth and was served with pork belly chashu, wood ear fungus, seaweed and fresh spring onion. He ordered the addition of the egg as well. Service was quick and soon after we ordered, the bowls were in front of us. Great depth of flavor in the broth (key to any excellent ramen) and noodles cooked perfectly al dente (helps that you can pick based on your personal noodle firmness). I really enjoyed the addition of the minced pork in mine and the added kick from the spice. The egg was excellent, beautifully cooked with a slightly soft yolk. One of the most flavorful eggs I've had. I should have ordered two... or five. The chashu was cooked well with a good ratio of fat to meat. The pickled ginger was a nice addition to help cut the fat. We don't usually order dessert but the matcha soft serve was calling our names. It was a great way to end the meal - not overly sweet with an intense matcha flavor that I loved. Compared to what you get and pay at the other ramen places in London, Kanada-Ya is completely worth it. When I'm in the mood for ramen, here or Ippudo will be my only options worth considering.",

Ordered the classic tonkotsu ramen, as it comes. The stock is thick and rich and not too salty which is good. The flavours I got from the broth were very unami, mushroomy with a porky base, even slightly truffle like.The noodles however were very fine diameter so a little insubstantial and the pork slices tender but a bit on the skimpy side.Portion size medium, not huge but the soup is pretty rich and so it was satisfying enough.Prices a bit on the steep side as they always are for ramen.Service was good and friendly.Overall good but not wowed is my summary. I like Bone Daddies better.",

Even the rice was bland, the salty filling didn't help balance the flavour.Overall the ramen and broth waa good.

We ordered the salmon rice ball, toneki and truffle ramen. Toppings such as eggs are extra and you can choose your ramen firmness. Tonkatsu - super creamy broth!! The London version (Tonkatsu X) is less creamy. It was great and not super salty. Truffle Ramen - It came with a spoonful of truffle that you mix into the broth. It's so strong but absolutely amazing!! You can taste the truffle but it still keeps the flavor of your typical ramen broth. Noodles were great (hard) and decent portions. Rice balls - just alright. Salmon wasn't flavored at al it seemed like but the rice was good. It really lacked in comparison to the ramen. Would have loved to come back again just for this truffle ramen.",

We were seated by 6:30pm and our orders were taken shortly after we sat down. For starters, we shared a karaage. This was alright. I felt that there was too much batter but the chicken was really tender. For my ramen, I usually go for the tonkotsu but wanted to try something different this time. I decided on the truffle tonkotsu and my friend got the regular tonkotsu and an egg (extra) for both of us. You can choose the level of firmness for your noodles and we both picked \"hard\" as recommended by the restaurant. The truffle tonkotsu definitely did not disappoint. The truffle flavor and scent were strong but I could still taste the creaminess of the tonkotsu broth. The pork was flavorful and had just the right amount of fattiness though I wished each piece was thicker! What I loved most was the heaping serve of scallions and the yolks of the tamago. They were flavorful and cooked perfectly - even though the egg is extra I highly recommend getting it! The only thing I wish could be better was the thickness and the texture of the noodles - the noodles were pretty thin even though we got \"hard\" noodles it still felt less than al dente.In terms of taste, Kanadaya is definitely my favorite ramen joint in London. I'll be back frequently!",

    "text": "My favourite tonkotsu ramen place in London so far.Their broth is rich and thick, which is why I prefer the spicy pork meatball or the yuzu spicy versions which have spice and sourness to cut the creaminess.I heavily recommend the tori karaage (Japanese fried chicken) the hot crispiness contrasts well with the velvety broth.Our surprise discovery was the truffle edamame. The cheapest truffle treat I've seen in London, but packed with fragrance and flavour. I was very impressed with the combination. The truffles pair very well with the mild beans.We ordered the matcha green tea and the special ice cream. On this visit, the special was sesame and I must say I hugely preferred it over the matcha Ice cream.",

    "text": "On my first night in London, I was looking for some comfort food and Kanada-Ya was close to where I was staying. There wasn't a queue as I went around 8pm and was quickly greeted and seated. The menu had a few unique items like Tonkotsu X and Truffle ramen, but I ultimately chose the Tonkotsu X as it was a \"London exclusive\". A cool feature was customizing the hardness/chewiness of the noodles, and I went with hard as they suggested. The soup was quite flavourful and hot enough, and the 3 pieces of meat were a perfect size. The only thing missing was the egg. However, all the flavours blended together beautifully and made it an enjoyable and authentic ramen eating experience. The shop is small, but there are 2 levels of seating. I would definitely eat here again, even if there was a queue.",

Too much pork fat that I wish they have some fruit tea on the menu to wash it down. However all they have are ramen and rice balls.Maybe a good place for others who enjoy heavy broth, but definitely not me.",

It *is* really rich and I realise that I couldn't eat that much oily goodness every day BUT I love it.- They'll cook your noodles how you like them. (Go hard.)- The eggs cost extra, but you need them! Seriously. The eggs are so, so good. I should probably have copied Ali C and ordered two eggs - although I am not sure I'd be able to eat that much.- I could write a whole extra review about the matcha soft serve. It has a really good, strong matcha flavour, and yet somehow manages to be refreshing at the same time. - You can book a table! It's all the noodle-joy without the wait! \u00a0A while ago my friends in the boozy bunch (boozybunch.com/tag/ramen\u2026) reviewed all of London's best ramen joints in #ramenwars and they voted Bone Daddies as the best ramen, with Kanada-ya as an honourable mention. I think they all need to come back and re-try their noodles as I am pretty sure Kanada-ya is better.",

    "text": "On Panton Street sits Kanada-Ya, a cosy authentic Japanese Ramen bar.My experience:My love of Japanese food never seems to ends, so last year when I was invited to review Kanada-Ya ramen bar I quickly accepted. Kanada-Ya sits in the heart of Piccadilly and is a well-known ramen bar.Upon arrival, I traditionally ordered a sake sampler, which one is supposed to consume from left to right, and the sakes became sweeter and stronger as I drank on. Firstly, was the 'Jewel brocade'- (Dewazakura Omachi Junmai Ginjo). A premium chilled sake, which is extremely flavoured with honey and sweet rice. For me, it was extremely sweet but in a distinctive way. Second from the sampler was the 'Heart of Oak' (Tamagawa Junmai)- Which is a masterpiece made by the genius British sales master Philip Harper, it was nutty and deep Umami and is to be served at room temperature. \u00a0For me, this was better than the Jewel Brocade, it was rich in sweetness but does not leave a bitter aftertaste. Finally, the Yuzu (Umenoyado Yuzu liqueur)- a refreshing Japanese and fruit sake. For me this was the best of all sakes, as the alcohol was prominent, but was sweet and cooling, this definitely was my favourite.Although Kanada-Ya is predominately known for their Ramen, I was feeling extra hungry and thought I would try out some of their small plates. Karaage is Japanese fried chicken, served with mayo. I was pleasantly surprised with the first bite as the fried chicken is soft, supple and gently breaks off in the mouth. The chicken is well seasoned and full of flavour and is served in four pieces, although I only ended up eating one piece as the Karaage is quite filling.I also tried the Kanada-Ya's Aburi Chashu, which is seared Chashu pork belly with yakiniku tare. I am a big lover of pork; especially pork belly and I could not wait to try this! The pork belly melted in my mouth and the musky but sweet taste enhanced once dipped in the provided sauce. The only issue is that some of the pork pieces were hard. I was advised to try the Tonkotsu X or Tonkotsu, which are the most popular Ramen choices at Kanada-Ya, however, I was coming down with a cold and the best way to cure a cold is with spice. Therefore, I chose the spicy Yuzu ramen; with spicy Yuzu, pork, corn-fed chicken broth, Chashu pork collar, wood ear fungus, seaweed and spring onion. The menu recommends choosing hard ramen noodles, so I went ahead with this recommendation I was worried about the wood ear fungus because I had no clue what ear fungus actually is, but all the ingredients in the dish worked well together. The ramen was full of flavour, as the taste of the spicy chicken broth has a potent taste, and is just the right amount of spice, which enabled me to still enjoy the dish. The seaweed added a more salty/savoury aftertaste to the ramen. I still had some Aburi Chashu left from my starters, so I added this to the ramen and let it soak in the broth, which aided in softening up the pork. I felt that there was not enough pork in the dish, but that is because I am a heavy meat eater, so I would advise adding extra meat as a topping.After most of the content of the ramen was gone, I shamelessly sipped on the chicken broth, which was delicious and I do believe it aided in getting rid of my cold, which is a bonus! As it was my second time trying ramen, I really enjoyed this experience and I would love to go back and try the Tonkotsu X.To refresh my palette I had a full large glass of Yuzu sake, which is very refreshing after the ramen. However, you are warned, for this sake is a silent creeper for the sake is so sweet that I did not realise the amount of alcohol I was consuming! Overall, this was a great experience for me as my second time eating ramen. Kanada-Ya is ideal if popping in on a lunch break from work, or casually eating with friends.Price: \u00a3(However, the sakes can get pricey)What to wear: Smart casual(I wore a blazer, top and trainers)Ambience: Cosy restaurant with knowledgeable staff",

Usually, I would say go straight for the ramen as I find that the sides were not worth it. \u00a0However, the matcha soft serve ice cream here is extremely good. \u00a0The matcha flavour is very strong and they really do not hold back on it. \u00a0It is extremely expensive for the matcha powder and I am glad they make it as they do. \u00a0Finally, please order more of the hanjuku eggs. \u00a0I have always ordered 2 eggs. \u00a0If I have my way, I would order about 4 or 5 eggs. \u00a0But it would most prob not fit that well in my bowl and I'm sure I will be embarassed when my neighbour stares at me. \u00a0 Oh god, marinated so well and its definitely more orgasmic than se*.",

    "text": "There is a reason they have won the Top 50 Ramen of Japan award. This is superior ramen, so only come here if you can appreciate it and won't settle for just any cheap bowl of dirty water.It's all about the broth and noodles, both they have mastered. Go with their recommendation for hard noodles as they will be the perfect consistency. The broth is thick and hearty but not overwhelming. I've had the truffle which is basically a mushroom soup strong in flavour so prepare yourself. I've also enjoyed the Tonkatsu X, \u00a0the pork and chicken combo that pairs nicely. My favourite is the spicy and powerful Geikkan, tanten men which has a pork broth, minced pork with a load of spice and pork slices. Mix it cautiously so you only get the right amount of spice at a time.Toppings are all on point, having tried the black garlic oil which is a great flavour addition to the base and the delicious egg is a must, prepared well to provide the best flavour and consistency of yolk to egg white ratio.Side dishes like karaage and edamame are tasty as well but you really want to come and enjoy the ramen. They even have a yuzu cold ramen if you want something different. Whatever you get will be excellent and I dare you not to return, no matter how scary the queue may be!",
