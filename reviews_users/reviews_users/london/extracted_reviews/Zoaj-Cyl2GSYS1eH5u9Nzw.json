    "text": "Nice, over-priced gastro-pub. Really nice cocktails, but so expensive that I couldn't really allow myself to get to the level of inebriation that makes me forget how much I hate spending too much time in Belgravia. Would highly recommend the 'Fallen Leaves' cocktail. I also had the fish and chips because I was told it was the best fish and chips ever, and it really wasn't. It was good, but I could have just gone to a chipper and saved about \u00a310, because it wasn't the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. That said, it was pretty high-end fish and chips, for example, they wrapped the lemon in cheesecloth so you wouldn't get any pulp on your fish. Get in early if you want a table, it's big with the apres-work crowd. Good place to go with co-workers, grandmothers, or clients. Avoid if you are a bohemian or enjoy hanging in Camden.",

They have dinning at the bar, which is very noisy, and an upstairs dinning room that has a very ceremonious air to it. The service is ok, and they have a wine list that can dizzy you if you are not a connoisseur. It's usually full on Sundays for they serve a truly delicious Sunday Roast. They also have organic roasts for those who expect eco-friendly food. My advice is to leave some space for dessert they have amazing apple tarte tatin with winter spiced ice cream.",

    "text": "Look, this isn't a neighborhood pub. Anyone reviewers who seem shocked that it was expensive and posh, must be blind. The Cubitt is a great gastropub, with a great atmosphere. It is squarely in Belgravia, and so obviously the crowd/decor matches the neighborhood. Putting that aside, the food is solid and I've always had a great time here. We live a few blocks away, and so the Cubitt fills our nice dinner without trekking across town category. I am not sure I'd make a special trip from across town to eat here, but if you live nearby or have post dinner plans in Sloane Square, why not give it a try?One thing worth noting, it can be quite loud inside at dinner, so I wouldn't have a romantic date planned here. If you are looking for an alternative nearby, check out The Ebury, similar menu with a slightly younger crowd.",

I think I will dream about the fish and chips here....they were amazing. My sister and I went on a Saturday night, were seated promptly and had beers in front of us within 5 minutes. However, I would agree with some of the other reviews here that the general pace of service for food here is leisurely (at best). But it was kind of that was across the board in London, so perhaps that is just how they do it. Very cool atmosphere, the crowd was mostly 30's yuppie types. Good looking staff and nicely appointed bar/dining room with all wood interior - and the neighborhood was very nice for walking around in, it is on a street lined with cute shops, the famous milliner Phillip Tracey has a spot across the street. An overall very satisfying dinner that I was fine with paying 24pounds for.",

Sure, he had his reasons ... and i guess there are many who agree with him since the place was packed with people at sunday lunch time in an area where it would otherwise be difficult to find someone outdoors. The queue extended onto the street (this was a common feature to all my subsequent visits). It really deserves a mention for its food ... and if they concentrated more on it they can turn into a good proper restaurant. The pies here are some of the best i have had in London. But the prices are not pub-like ... they are steep. They are good ... but i wouldn't wait half an hour to be served expensive british food at \u00a0a public house ... however good it might be ... the feeling just isn't right.",

Once you find the little staircase that takes you up to the dining room however, any uncertainty floats away into one of the most pleasurable dining experiences I've had in a while. The atmosphere is classical, and simple. The dining tables are big and well separated allowing that wonderful feeling of privacy in a busy room without having to shout your way into someone's ear. The staff attentive, have a tendency to appear only when needed and do not require instructions to be repeated - a luxury which tends to be reserved for Michelin rated restaurants. The food is great traditional upmarket restaurant fare - racks of lamb, scallops - that sort of thing, and is executed remarkably well. And the best bit is the bill - at 40 quid for a 3 course meal you could easily end up paying twice this for a much shoddier experience. If only there were more places like this..",

At the Cubitt it's all dining). This is intensely frustrating if you want to organise a work do, or even a simple weekday lunch for a few friends from the office. It's not cheap, the food is pretty good but I've had better for the price, and the service can be pretty hit and miss. Also, don't confuse the downstaris Cubitt with the upstairs Cubitt - different menu upstairs, and even more expensive. They're always full by 1pm, which is, I'm sure, why they don't bother with bookings, but these policies win them no friends, adn they should watch ou tin the economic downturn - there are plenty of cheaper places to eat in the area.",

Sadly we were disapointed with the service we recieved. The waiter got us drinks very quickly. But after I had ordered I asked the waitress after 30 mins to check on our order. She informed me that the kitchen had not recieved it! When it did eventually arrive I was disapointed with my Veggie Burger. It had very little character and was served witha few chips in a small container. Not what we were expecting from a Belgravia establishment! Now the place was very busy and I suspect this may have been an isolated mistake. We did get free wine however. But the apolagy was pretty poorly delivered. I may go again.

Good mix between those eating and those just drinking. Prices are standard of a gastropub. They have a good seasonal menu, which does change frequently. While I'm not a huge fan of their current selection, their salt and pepper squid was fantastic and their burger is always a good staple. They also offer a changing selection of cocktails (although not a huge selection). Service however has been getting increasingly sloppy, especially at busy periods, and I have waited longer than one should to be served. Good sunday lunch roast selection.",

This place is typical Belgravia.If it wasn't trying so hard I probably wouldn't hate it so much. But it is, and I do.Ubiquitous silver walls, purposefully worn woodwork, elegant flowers. You know the deal. This place SCREAMS 'understated'.All the serving staff are good looking. I don't mind that but I would much prefer to be served by someone ugly who had tasted the dishes on offer. I want food not a lap dance. When one of the party wanted some help in choosing between one dish and another, the waiter shrugged and said he had never tasted either. Gimme an Anne Widdecome or Jeremy Clarkson any day of the week, so long as they can remember what's in the specials without having to refer to their note book 5 times. Normally that sort of thing wouldn't bother me in the slightest but when a place reckons itself so much, why hold back? This lot should just relax. Dole out reasonably priced food in a nice bright room with waiters of all shapes and sizes and faces. Then turn down the shitty 'chill out' music. In fact turn it off. I didn't come here to nod my head and come down. And tell the waiter to stop putting silly coloured dots of sauce on the plate to make it look like haute cuisine. It tastes horrible. The orange gunk that came with my duck was rank. In fact so was the duck. Tougher than Run DMC. And they were tougher than leather. If they did all that, I might come back, and it might get 3 or 4 stars. Because the bread was nice, and my scallop starter was decent too.",

He knew about my phobia of British restaurants, as I'm visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area - I've had horrid experiences with restaurants in London. We sat downstairs in the bar on a busy Saturday night - they had a few tables available so there was no wait. I would call the service leisurely, but we weren't in a hurry so it fit our mood fine. I had the special pan-fried bream, which came with smoked salmon mashed potatoes, a beurre blanc sauce, and broccolini, along with three shelled mussels distributed on the plate. It was very good! The taste combinations were very nice - not haute cuisine level, more \u00a0advanced comfort food. Partly this was because, although the bream, smoked salmon, and mussels attempted to create a unifying theme, from that standpoint, though delicious, they were just a bit gimmicky.My friend had a cheeseburger and chips. He originally ordered it with blue cheese, rather than cheddar, but that would have been \u00a33 extra, so he stuck with the basics. It was fine, but nothing to write home about, he said. We finished with their Burnt Orange Marmalade pudding and the apple crumble. Both were very good, plates basically licked clean. Total bill per person, with main, dessert, and two drinks (beer and port for me, two beers for him) was \u00a338. I thought it was high but reasonable. (When in Europe, when something only costs the same in \u00a3s as it does in $s at home, I figure it's reasonable.) If we had the same restaurant with the food *I* had in Menlo Park, where I live, I'd go often. Minuses: The servings were a little smaller than I'd like (but on the other hand I didn't leave hungry). It was quite loud in the bar, although we were in a quieter area so didn't have to shout.",

It's almost claustrophobic and I began looking for hidden cameras because it felt like a movie set. However, downstairs (can get a seat? are you willing to fight the masses?), you will find fantastic opportunity for people watching. Pretty and sweet server (the boys at my table were drooling). I was drooling over the red wine list \u00a0and since our server knew a lot about this, I let her choose. Again, diggin' the London gastro pubs because Gluten Free is not a problem there. They never have to ask twice or return sweating over your table.",

    "text": "We went here for a friend's 30th birthday. She had hired the private dining room at the top of the pub and had a Sunday roast feasting menu. Everyone chose their starter and then we shared platters of meats and veg and then there was a cake for dessert. My starter of chicken, tarragon and leek verrine was absolutely delicious with nice chunks of meat on on the top. The sourdough bread it came with was fine - not the best sourdough I've ever had but a good accompaniment. Just wish there had been more of it. As much as I like terrines and pates, I don't really like to eat them on their own like it's rice pudding or something. They're much better on bread. The Sunday roast was definitely one of the better ones I've had in a pub. I made sure to get a nice piece of rare roast beef. The roast potatoes were outstanding - properly crispy on the outside. They also served cauliflower cheese which was a bit heavy on one of the hottest days of the year, and also they gave us two full dishes of this and only one of the vegetables so there was loads left over. The cheesy topping was fantastic though and I had to make sure it wasn't near me or I'd have kept eating more. The honey-glazed carrots were lovely - I wish there had been much more of those. The pork was a little odd - slightly undercooked, though one of my friends said the trend these days is for rarer pork so perhaps they were being fashionable rather than not having cooked it properly. For dessert, as it was a birthday, there was a huge cake to share. This was nice and light, which befit a summer's day, but oddly flavourless. Was it sponge? Mousse? Cheesecake? None of us could really tell and there were weird bits of jelly in it. Not unpleasant but not one to linger over either. We went for some drinks downstairs which were pleasant, although there was something slightly off about the staff. We were told we had to go downstairs as our time in the private area was up, but when we went down they clearly didn't want us to make an afternoon of it, saying they would probably get busy in a couple of hours. It's obviously a place to eat, rather than a drinking establishment. Ultimately I thought it was nice though and would go back, though a little pricey (as you'd expect from the area).",

Have been to Pantechnicon, another Cubitt pub, many times, and wanted to try something new. \u00a0It was 3pm on a sunny Saturday and the sidewalk patio and dining room in the front of the restaurant were full...except for one perfect table! All the doors were open and it was just a really nice atmosphere. \u00a0A bit more exciting and trendy than the Pantechnicon, but same good quality food and general feel. \u00a0Started with fried squid to share which is a fave from Pantchnicon and didn't disappoint. Had the burger which was fantastic, and came with about 8 thick cut fries. Always love a thick fry over a skinny so was pleased with that. \u00a0Had the blackcurrant (i think) cider at the recommendation of the waitress and it was yummy too. \u00a0Finished off with the berry crumble for dessert but would skip it next time. It looked better than it tasted. \u00a0The \"crumble\" on top was actually just a layer of dry oats \u00a0that seemed like they had been added after cooking the berries (generally i expect the crumble to be a bit crispy with some brown sugar and butter possibly melted in...)

It looked very airy and spacious from the street, so we decided to give it a go. We sat next to the bar in the passageway between the front and the back, but it wasn't crowded or cramped at all. We had a glass skylight above us and the floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the open restaurant let in so much light and a lovely breeze. The menu had so much to choose from that it was hard to make a decision. We both ended up going for the cod special that was served on a couscous and mint salad. I had baked beetroot as a side and my friend had the peas. The cod was delicious, and the salad was perfect. I thought that the beetroot could have been a touch more flavoursome - it comes with horseradish, but even that didn't give quite the kick I was looking for. The cod more than made up for it though. We were cajoled into having pudding and shared the apple and cherry crumble with ginger ice cream. Heavenly concoction! Really lovely. Definitely enough to share too - it was enormous! I would highly recommend this restaurant, the service and food were great and I think it was really good value for money - the ingredients are all fresh and THEY HAVE SKIMMED MILK!!! \u00a0:-)",

The potatoes are crispy on the outside and fluffy--yet substantial-- on the inside. The veggies are presented beautifully with, what I think, is a buerre monte to add shine and flavor. I request a pot of gravy just for myself to dip my Yorkshire pudding. With a glass of Billecarte-Salmon, I cannot imagine a better way to spend a leisurely Sunday with friends and family.If you're lucky to catch a warm summer day (there are so few of them) the wide open French doors let you enjoy the weather on charming Elizabeth Street. But if the weather is dismal, the cozy pub warms you before your food and drink even arrive.",

    "text": "This is a decent-sized gastro-pub in the heart of Belgravia, not far from Victoria station. The interior has been modernised with trendy pale green 'distressed' wooden panelling downstairs, and a more formal dining room upstairs. It's actually one of the better places to drink in the area, though, as others have said, most go there to eat. But it's a good to know place given the dearth of decent drinking venues around Victoria. They have a couple of hand-pumps (one serving nice Deucars) and also serve a Suffolk cider (\"cyder\") which is very refreshing. Beer is about \u00a33.50 a pint - but, then, you are in Belgravia... On nice days the frontage screens are rolled back and there's a lot of pavement table seating which makes for a nice sunny day venue. There's table service throughout, which can be a bit hit and miss when they're busy, and it does get quite busy at lunchtimes and after work. I've not eaten upstairs, but reports are good: again, eating downstairs in the 'pub' part gets more mixed reviews, particularly about speed of service. But if you've got the time, it's a fairly relaxed venue.",

Staff is very friendly, and the food good. The only down side was the slow service which made no sense as we arrived after the lunch rush hour. I would recommend this place is you are near Victoria and looking for a nice place to go.",

    "text": "A whole lotta 'meh'.This place was highly recommended in my guide book, so we gave it a shot this evening on a whim.At the time we stumbled across this place, I happened to be walking around with a piping hot and fresh cup of Starbucks that I had picked up 5 minutes earlier on Buckingham Palace Road. When I got there, I was told they had to ditch it because it wouldn't look nice on the table.There's always a pretty good chance I'll have a cup of coffee in my hand when I'm walking around. And anytime I may have gone into a pub with one, they have never really cared so long as I ordered something. It's not like i was going to come into Thomas Cubitt, drink my Starbucks and go. So what's the problem? Well, they're not really a true pub, are they? It's more of a wannabe upscale place masquerading as a pub. Any true neighborhood pub could care less if you had a cup of coffee so long as you're dropping some Sterling. Guess this place is too fancy for my shenanigans. Heaven forbid someone sees a cup of coffee on the table.Anyway, we got the fish and chips and Diet Coke which came to 20 pounds, not inclusive of a 12.5% tip which they added on. Pretty pricey for what you get. The food was mediocre at best. The chips were a bit on the undercooked side, and the fish was average.As for the service, it was spotty, snobby, and underwhelming. It's also the kind of staff that waits in the shadows ready at any moment to grab your plate and get you out of there as fast as possible. Impatient waitstaff are the worst. Let me enjoy my meal!Definitely not worth a second visit, or even a first really.",

Definitely glad we chose this restaurant because both the roast lamb and roast beef were excellent. We sat upstairs and there were only a few other tables being sat so it was nice and quiet, as opposed to downstairs which is much more energetic. I think next time we'd sit downstairs just because the atmosphere was more lively. Both meats were cooked well, though the beef was the better of the two. Fantastically cooked and seasoned very well. The yorkshire pudding, which is actually a popover was amazing as were the roasted vegetables. Total cost for both roasts and four glasses of wine was 71.94.",

We ended up here for dinner on our last night in London and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, from delicious food and drinks to a fun atmosphere. Many diners were glued to a TV playing a high-stakes Wimbledon match and the front floor-to-ceiling windows facing the street were thrown open in the summer weather. The restaurant is located on a charming, quiet block in the Belgravia neighborhood. We ordered from the bar menu. The seasonal gin and tonic with strawberry and lemongrass, octopus appetizer, scotch egg and fish and chips were standouts. I'd love to go for their Sunday roast.We came on a weeknight and it was busy but easy to get a table; we walked by on a weekend evening, however, and there was a huge crowd outside and line to get in.",

    "text": "+ Great food+ Nice ambience in a lovely neighbourhood + Both classical British food and inventive dishes + Always busy + Therefore, it can be a bit noisy and crowdedOverall: The pub was already packed with people celebrating the end of week when we got there just before 6 for an early dinner. The area at the front of pub was SO noisy as people (mostly post work drinkers) were practically shouting to each other to make themselves heard over excessively loud music from the speakers. But they found a table for us in a smallish dining room at the back. The back room was much quieter. In contrast to the bar area, the customers in the back room consisted mostly of families and couples with hairy dogs (like the ones rich people have). My seat was a little tight as the tables are laid out quite closely to each other. But I didn't mind. I only care about food. Thomas Cubitt is a great gastro pub that serves great modern British food. The dining bar with warm wooden furniture has abundant of natural light from large windows that look out to Elisabeth Street. \u00a0I've only eaten downstairs but they also have a formal dining room upstairs for posh people. They have separate menu there. I've only looked at their website but the upstairs room seem a little too formal and stuffy for my taste. Food: I ordered pumpkin, quinoa and green apple salad. The salad was great. Red quinoa and pumpkin add a pleasant texture to the fresh spinach laves. Red cabbage and the yogurt based mustard dressing help combine all the individual ingredients. However, the star of this dish is the green apple. The firm and fresh apples introduce the nature zing and delightful juiciness to this salad. The fish and chips my friend ordered was great too.",

They do share some of their dishes with the orange but what we took was not on the menu when visited the orange a week before. We had to start the terrine and the black pudding, delicious. Nice servings so beware of you do not wish to eat to much. Nice specially breads with it and a long list of wines to choose from. We went for a not too too fancy burgundy wine from France to pair along those dishes. For mains we went for the special pork belly served with some haggis, Mushy green peas. It was perfectly cooked. Crackly, greasy (it is pork belly), but not too much, haggis tasty and not overwhelming because it is served as tiny side portions. Very well paired I thought and it makes a great combo to try some local foods if visiting the UK. Overall nice place to have dinner and for the bar review see my other review. Good times as well.",

    "text": "Went there on a Friday night with our five year old daughter and a case of jet lag from a 9 hour flight. The entire staff was super nice and went out of their way to explain the menu and talk with us. My fish and chips were awesome! \u00a0My husbands steak was a little tough. I also ordered the watermelon with mint and pistachios, but it wasn't my favorite. It was a bit expensive, $65 for two people and that's without any drinks. As we squeezed out of the restaurant with our stroller and kid, the entire staff said thank you and good night, which I thought was super cool. I would definitely go back for the fish and chips.",

    "text": "As a family friendly bar this place is great!Atmosphere and Location: (Rating 5) Love the location and look and feel of this place. It's a little loud, so be ready for that. It's also a little tight with regards to table and chair placement, so be ready to meet your neighbors. ;) But the overall look, decor and large windows looking outside create a fun bar / upscale cafe friendly feel.Fish and Chips (Rating 2) With regards to the fish and chips I had high hopes as this place was recommended to me. I wasn't overly impressed however. While the entree looked great plated, the fish was not that great (overly oily from frying) and maybe not that good to start with. The breading wasn't as crisp as I would have liked as well and even the flavor was a bit dull IMO. Sorry guys.",
