Well, in all honesty, I can safely say that the Island Queen is in my top 3 pubs in the whole of the country (the Sole Bay Inn in Southwold and the Fat Cat in Norwich are my other two). This pub has it all. Great beers, beautiful decor, nice staff, space to settle in, and decent enough food. It is the best in summer, when the light streams in through the enormous front windows and the crackle of summer joy is in the air. What a lovely place. Go go go go go (there)!",

Beware the pickpockets - two friends lost wallets during a birthday party - and often the ales seem to be strange or off - but somehow this place makes up for it with the atmosphere and the Fruli. Food is only decent, but it does the job when you've been there longer than expected and need something to eat.",

    "text": "I have been a long term patron of The Island Queen and have often recommended it to people looking for a good pub in Islington. However, the treatment I received at the hands of its present manager, Antonia Orpen, whose customer care skills are beyond appalling and more in the realms of a horrific car crash, simply have to be given as a warning to anyone thinking of using the place. I have never, ever been treated so disgracefully as I have been by this woman, and if the problems others have reported vis a vis bad service are to be believed, then it is little surprise given the atrocious attitude of the person in charge. If I was the owner of this pub I would be horrified to find out that someone as awful at dealing with customers was supposedly the representative of my business.The other day I rang the pub on behalf of my girlfriend to find out if she had left her black scarf in the pub and if it had been found. Ms Orpen reported that it had been but managed to hang up the phone before I had a chance to tell her my name, when the scarf would be retrieved and the name of the person collecting it. I had to ring back, and when I pointed out that she had hung up the phone before I had had the chance to pass on the information, she proceed to scream denials and blue murder down the phone at me. The following day my girlfriend took an hour out to go and retrieve her scarf, but on arrival it had bizarrely gone missing and no such item was to be found. However, when I called the pub back to find out what the story was, there was actually a scarf, but it had turned pink overnight. Ms Orpen proceeded once more to shout down the phone at me and hang up again. I phoned a final time to try and give her a chance to sort this situation out but once again I was shouted at, abused and hung up on.Such epically bad behaviour would usually see an employee fired, but to see it from a manager beggars belief. Such individuals do a disservice to the good pubs we have and eventually will start deservedly impacting on business. Antonia Orpen should think long and hard about her chosen career as she simply is not suited to working with people. Similarly, pub owners Mitchells and Butlers would do well do dispose of her questionable and limited talents before they cost a good pub not just money but also its reputation.",

Fortunately a friend of mine was friends with the female bar tender. We went back to the bar and then I noticed that the pump clip on the Landlord had been turned round. I'd been given the very last pint in the barrel. Which explains why the ale tasted so unlike the Landlord I'd had elsewhere previously.The barmaid offered to give me a new pint, of Black Sheep, but by then I really couldn't be bothered any more. Not with the barman looking like I just insulted his mother. And it was just a bit too crowded for my liking too - despite them serving two or three cask ales they seemed to be mostly lager drinkers. There are plenty of other, better, pubs in the area so the management really ought to arrange some staff training. Or employ staff who actually want to do a good job.",

I live in London!!!!\" The first time I walked into the Island Queen was also one of those \"wheeeee\" moments. The interior is breathtaking, and looks just like I imagined British pubs to look...antique dark wood, comfy couches, really high ceilings and even a fireplace! The whole place screams \"cosy\" and it most definitely is. As it's nearby my office, I've only ever come here at lunchtime but have not yet been disappointed with my meals. Though it's pretty standard pub fare, the chips are fresh and delicious and the sandwiches are a good value. With a variety of beverages and fantastic specials, this is one of my \"go-to\" places, especially when I know Upper Street will be too busy or if I'm too lazy to walk up there. I like that it's off the beaten path too - means that it's never been too crowded, which I like!",

    "text": "It's a game of two halves pub landlordery... And the owners / managers of the Island Queen have got it at least partly right. There are some lovely little touches in this recently converted old boozer in a quiet little road just off the hubub of Angel's Upper Street. Decor is lovely, a touch of the Farrow and Ball round the central bar in the middle of the building. Large windows, comfy sofas and boardgames to borrow. The food is excellent. We last went on a Sunday and the large, well cooked roasts came quickly and vanished quicker. Pub staples, sausage and mash, homemade pies etc littered the lower echelons of the short but succinct menu. There's a decent wine list, a good range of lagers and a handful of handpulls including the great Timothy Tailors Landlord. But, and there's a but... the staff don't make it easy to truly take the place to heart. I'm sure there's a simple lesson to be learnt in Bar Skills class - 'know who's next' - turning round to a crowded bar with a clueless, \"who was next?\" is only going to lead to problems among a bar three deep who have had to watch countless of your colleagues ignore them on the way to something more pressing. Oh, and try to treat people like humans too and give them the benefit of the doubt. Sure, some of your customers will be ar*eholes, you work in a bar in Islington after all, but not all of them will be, so save the attitude until you know one way or another. Sample exchange (with another customer)\"There's a wait on all food mate, 40 minutes, and you'll have to come back in a minute cos I'm not going to take food orders til they've caught up\" Customer \"Um, ok, is that on everything, or would a hummus starter come quicker\" \"That's food isn't it? So the wait's the same, what do you think?\" Case closed...",

As I was hungry went for it, the chicken was okay, but I couldn't work out whether the potatoes it came with were supposed to be roast but severely undercooked or just undercooked boiled. Either way most of them were rock hard and could have been used as an offensive weapon in a bar brawl if I had a spare sock. My plate was taken away without me even being asked if I had finished. One of the party had a pie and said it was more pastry than anything else. Not worth the price by any imagination or large amount of beer.",

I was disappointed to see 2 of the 3 ales on offer were off, but they redeemed themselves somewhat by having Kuppers Kolsch on, which I can't recall seeing before, outside of K\u00f6ln.

It stands out as a relatively rare find in a neighbourhood that has gone from affordably up-and-coming to expensively up-and-came. The menu is relatively broad and occasionally, modestly, adventurous (mushrooms AND beef on a burger!) and, most importantly, not unreasonably priced. The choice of real ales is attractive, also. I've found it a really good choice for evenings that start early and end up going late, as well as for evenings that start late and end comfortably early. You will hear no football chants; you will see no jostling; you will see no university students pounding back the pints. Surely all of these are selling points?Access wise, it's situated on a posh side street away from Angel and just north of the canal, thus easy walking distance from many canal-side locales as well as being easily reached by those who rely on tube, bus and bicycle.La classe!",

Large Victorian mirrors decorate the walls and add a bit of bling to the dark wood of the bar and chunky furniture.

    "text": "Lovely, lovely local pub. Based in Islington, just by one of London's prime waterways, Island Queen is a great starting or finishing point if you fancy a stroll along Regents Canal. The pub credits itself with having some of the world's best beers on tap, accredited real ales and a mixture of upstairs, downstairs and alfresco spaces to enjoy your tipple. All that said, one thing it excels at is its cosyness and local feel. Islington is not the biggest commercial centre, but many of the pubs on the high street can be filled with after work noisy drinkers. As this is a bit off the beaten track, it's clientele was a small group of locals and those in the know. The staff are also a selling point, good with the banter, smiley and relaxed in service style. This is the perfect place to enjoy your ale or opt for a glass from the decent wine selection. On our visit, we decided to have some food as well. This is where the compliments end. At \u00a314.50 for sirloin steak in a pub, you would have expected it to be less tough and fatty. The dish was served with fries, no greens or salad anywhere to be seen as a side, although on the menu it did reference watercress. It was a Monday when we visited and maybe food is not where their passion is with the great wet offering, but for a what is a fair amount of cashola, you do expect a little bit more. Even at restaurants which pride themselves firstly and foremost on selling steak as a feature item, you get similarly priced sirloin which tastes epic and is money well spent. My advice is that it's great for drinks and hanging with friends. However, be careful with the main food. Perhaps the small pates are a better options to soak up the booze. Looking at some of the tripadvisor reviews, it seems to be the general consensus that food is not the way to go :(.",

Excellent choice of beer and ales, complimented by friendly staff. Love the high ceilings and olde Victorian decor create an airy, lofty ambience. \u00a0I didn't order any food but scanning the joint, the plates from other patrons looked mighty tasty. \u00a0Looking forward to checking it out again.",

    "text": "A really lovely Victorian pub right on the canal in Angel. I came here with my group of housemates for our Christmas dinner and it was absolutely wonderful. We had to pay a deposit and preorder our food beforehand which actually worked really well. We were sat next to the Christmas tree which was lovely and the staff were very attentive. I wasn't wild about the fact we still had to go up to the bar to get drinks though they were nice enough to offer table service for the drinks on two occasions. The food was delicious - I had a carrot soup which was really nice, and then the turkey, which was ever so slightly dry but still tasted great. I followed that with the lemon and coconut cheesecake which was very sweet but really nice. We had a great time and the staff were brilliant. The pub is reasonably small but very comfortable and would be a perfect place for a Sunday lunch!",

    "text": "All I seem to do is review pubs recently... Huh. Well, The Island Queen is right by my place, I think I've gone past it while out on a run but it's never occurred to me to go in for a drink. My friend wanted a quiet bottle of wine somewhere late on a Wednesday night so we popped in. I really liked the 'local' vibe. Lots of comfy tables and places to just hang out with no wanky Islington types to bother you. I guess that's the appeal of it being tucked away down these side streets. It wasn't busy but it was buzzing enough to be lively and quiet enough that we easily grabbed a table. The downside is that the bartender knew nothing about the wines on offer, argued a bit with us over that and then suggested a bottle that was actually terrible. The wine isn't cheap either, so maybe just order by the glass. The pub food on offer here seems pretty decent so I'm looking forward to trying it out as my future local! We ended up so late here that they had to boot us out!",

The kind of place you want to step into for a cheeky one (or two) on a drizzly autumn night. Reading the reviews here I was actually a little wary of what I was up for, but I need not have been - staff were great. It was busy (Tuesday is quiz night btw) and service was fine. Really good, even.There was one small glitch where the bar was left completely unattended for a little bit but I only really noticed because I was keen to get to my dinner which had just been served.Dinner was the ox cheek pie - it was decent. Get it if it's available. Looking forward to a return visit and more than happy to have the Island Queen on my starting line-up of locals.",

It was quirky and had slighty macabre giant old marionettes hanging from the ceiling and I think there was some red paint involved in the decor...It was quirky and good and just weird enough.Things have moved on, of course. The marionettes have been done away with, maybe a victim of health and safety rules or gastrofication, or an attempt to attract a different clientele perhaps.The pub is a bit plainer now but still a bit funky with the central semi circular bar and quite small inside and does food (others have reviewed). There's a room upstairs too since it gets crowded but the room wasn't an inviting pub space to hang out in.Overall nice enough but didn't have anything special to want me to make it a regular of mine.",
