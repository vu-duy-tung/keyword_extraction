It has to be seen. The burger was all right, pretty good even. The look of the room isn't exactly jawdropping, but nothing to whine about. CASK is flirting with five stars, and I will try to get back there soon to give them a chance to fight for it!",

The staff is kind enough to allow one to try a shot before ordering a pint to make sure it is something you'll like.The food menu is very British pub food, and while I wasn't in the mood that day, it all looked great at nearby tables. It should be noted, there are only a few options for vegetarians - but there are some options.The space is very open, which means it is also very loud. Not a major issue, but certainly something to think about if you're planning to have a conversation.",

Chief amongst its attractions is its extraordinary range of beer (in the region of 350 different types), including some leftfield choices you're extremely unlikely to encounter in your typical boozer (I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast) and which you can takeaway. Their food is also reasonable and though a popular Pimlico hangout, it's usually possible to get a table. The only criticism I've heard of it is from wine-lovers unimpressed with their viticultural offerings, but then this is a beer house first and foremost. My favourite pub in Victoria/Pimlico.",

The chips were amazing and I wasn't even drunk! But I like a good thick chip that is hot out of the fryer. The nachos started off ok, but if they aren't eaten fast get congealed under the weight of the chili, cheese and refried beans. Maybe if there had been 5 of us vs. 3 this would have been a good pick. We will be going back, my husband has assured me of that! And hopefully this time I will try one of the many beers!",

Their condiments were amazing: Bloody Mary ketchup and several delicious mustards (and I'm usually not very fond of British mustards but their honey mustard was spot on). We both got bacon & cheese burgers, which were lovely (just the right amount of cheese and not too salty). The sweet potato fries and the regular fries were both good and crunchy. They kept the food very simple and enjoyable.Their ginger beer is very good, not too sweet and very gingery. They have a great selection of ales and lagers and if you feel a bit lost (like I did!) the staff is helpful and gives good advice.In total I think we paid about \u00a330 for the two of us, and had a lovely time and good meal.

Biggest beer menu I've ever seen, some of the tastiest ones as well. I ordered the \"Elvis\", which was great. The peanut butter was a little overwhelming, though. Flavour was spot on though. Maybe they could use just a little bit less..? ANYwho, the food was great, the beers were better, and the environment was cozy yet open enough. They have a bluegrass band that plays every night at 1630-1930, which is amazingly entertaining. Overall, I love this place.",

Oh, and the French fries? Top 5 French fries I've ever eaten. So damn crispy. How do they do that?Many cask beers on tap as well as bottles. I had two of their Bitter style brew. And, it wasn't just your regular old brew. Very tasty with a great finish. Unfortunately, I'm only in town for the night. \u00a0I'd recommend this to any friend and hide it from all enemies. I'd like to see a slightly enlarged menu. It's pretty limited. I get it, I get it. It's about the beer and burgers. Nonetheless, more menu items would be good.",

You could easily spend a whole evening here trying different beers you've never heard of and not even make a dent in the menu. And that's only \u00a0the drinks. It's worth the trip over to Cask for their burgers too. I had a simple cheeseburger (topped with cheddar) and it was delish, perfectly cooked burger on a nice brioche bun with a side of chips - I cleaned my plate. Also, must mention the fantastic array of sauces! Alongside your usual tomato ketchup, mayonnaise and bbq sauce, also sat a bloody mary ketchup and honey mustard! Not just mustard, honey mustard.. I haven't been able to find that anywhere else in London yet. Just to note, Cask seems to get really busy for after-work drinks on Friday and also on the weekends, but it's pretty manageable during the week.",

I think it was raspberry flavor and I don't remember the name :( but you'll have to trust me on that one if you enjoy fruity beer like I do. Just ask the bartender! As for the food, it is definitely a tiny selection for the noms but that's because you're supposed to come for the beer and why expect a gourmet food menu in a pub when all you need is a good selection of burgers? I had the veggie burger (halloumi and mushrooms) and I really enjoyed it. It's like I went to an actual burger joint and not a pub! Also, they have chips with BACON DUST! Yep, I was pretty mind-blown too! These were pretty good but watch out for your clothing - because it's bacon \"dust\" you may be fooled by how tasty and fluffy looking it is, but get some on your blouse and b-a-m, you realize you're literally eating bacon..in dust form. Crazy.For a non-beer enthusiast, I was content that I was able to find a drink I liked and the food to satiate my hunger but I do think it's more worth the visit if you're here for the drinks and not the food (that is unless you're into the idea of bacon dust. Really. How come I can't find this in San Francisco.)",

Lots of locals....fun to hear all the English accents - definitely adds to the charm. They also have a few spots outside to sit. Put it on your crawl list!",

It looks like a corner store. The atmosphere really isn't that cosy, it feel more like a Wetherspoons. Along with the type of people that attends such places. The seat are hard and the decor is rather boring. They also do not serve ANY hot drinks. No coffee, tea, etc. BUT, what makes this place great is the beer and the burgers. They have SO many beers and great staff that will tell you all about them :-) I had a sweeter on that was aged in a white wine barrel. The burgers, are okay. They're more fun than great. Thus my 4 stars. Overall, this is a fun place to go to for a very chilled afternoon. I would not recommended this place for a business meeting or a romantic night out. I would recommended it for a group of good friends that is looking for something different and to enjoy great beer with decent food :-)",

I had the Pheasant Plucker cider and it was everything I ever wanted (and more). It was sweet and just really easy to drink. I also had the Heat burger which was good but not amazing. They also give you a huge tray of condiments... Which blew my mind (the honey mustard mayo especially). If I were rating the burger alone, I'd give it 3 stars. I didn't like the texture of the patty. It was too dense for my liking. \u00a0The delicious blue cheese and buffalo sauce almost made up for the weird patty. Overall, great pub with amazing beer selection.

The place also has a good selection of bottled beers, including Cantillon and Hanssens sours (winning!). They also have a pretty solid list of American beers, if you're looking for that. Since we're also about trying local beers, we had a couple from Neptune Brewing, all of which were good. They do half-pours as well?Good service with a local crowd. The burgers looked good, but didn't eat so not sure taste.Seating might be hard to come by during busy times. They have a live band on Sunday evenings! Must visit for any beer fan in London!",

There was an extensive bottle list with options easily perused in the stand-alone refrigerators. The keg and cask selection was nicely curated with probably 20 choices, all from top breweries. Beers were served in correct glassware, at the correct temperature, and tasted fresh and well cared for. Pint prices were a touch high, but you are getting a better product. I did not try the food, but it looked great. If you are a beer enthuisanst, put this at the top of your list!",

The fries were good and could be served alone as snacks beside of the beers. The burger was terrible. Like one of the worst I have ever had. We ordered cheeseburgers and there was almost no cheese in either of them. The beefs were drier than a dessert in the summertime. Nothing was great about it.

I may come back and try again, and I personally don't need every beer ever brewed to be in the same room as me for me to be happy, but Cask will have to prove itself furher to me before it earns that 5th star.",

I've been wanting a decent pub in Victoria for so long, but I always end up in the rubbish ones. This one is only five minutes away from the station, but it's FANTASTIC. They have a mix of real ale and Belgian beers on, both of which are good. Not too pricey either. I had an ale which was very hoppy so decided to switch (one more and I'd have fallen on the floor). My friend was instructed to get me a light ale that was less hoppy than that one. He came back with something that looked like Engine Oil. A nice enough pint, but not to my tastes. Still, we swapped drinks and all was good. There's an outdoor seating area for the smokies. a friendly local vibe and I think they do food too. The barmen were also pleased when I told them that the ladies loos were a bit of a mess. But then I wondered if they thought I'd messed them up... If you're in the area, you should come here. It's a great little boozer, full of local charm and happy vibes. And strong beers that will get you really really tipsy.",

Sadly they did not have the beer I sought, however, they told me about this little gem tucked away on an inconspicuous corner in Pimlico - walk past and you might just miss it.The selection of beers is phenomenal and the friendly staff make selecting a beer an easy task. They also do solid nosh. Plan to have one or two here in the summer as there is (limited) outside seating.",

So - boys \u00a0(and girls) into their speciality \u00a0beers will love it.I feel it falls down on the atmosphere. You can see they've put effort into giving the place a makeover but the space is just not very cosy or conducive to settling in for more than one drink. But, that's just my very subjective opinion. Give it a go as you might find different and there's no doubt they're putting in 100% to making this place a success",

Since the pub was not far away from our hotel, we went there to have our drink, and we were surprised. The pub is comfortable and furnished in comtemporary style. The seats have pillows and the tables are not too close together. Enough space to talk to each other. They did not only have Ale. We also found German and Belgian beer. They have got beer from all over the world, and the best: beer from my Bavarian home ;-) The meals were simple and good. Because the kitchen was being refurbished, only sandwiches and burgers were available at that time, but then! We had a Scottish burger and it was one of the the best burgers I've ever had. (Meat even better than at Space Burger in D\u00fcsseldorf/Germany). The service is very friendly and so are the guests. Next year I am visiting this place again, when we go to London!",

My wife and I both had a pint of \u00a0Rothaus wheat beer, which was delish, and a fat burger with swiss cheese. The gentlemen behind the bar were welcoming and patient with our slow American ways. :)We definitely will return to enjoy some of their wonderful liquid fare.",

I wish I could've spent more time here but I had a meeting to go to, otherwise I could've spent hours in here. There's extremely friendly service, in a spacious and comfortable interior. You can chat to the landlord about the beer and get beers recommended to you. There's a good range of beers- not an exhaustive range but a variety that puts most London pubs to shame. The beer's not cheap, but you pay for quality. There's a limited and straightforward food menu, which I didn't try. (After a quick Google it seems that this pub was formerly known as the Pimlico Tram and was rebranded in 2008.)",

There is a huge bottle list but these beers tend to be on the pricey side. The draught stuff is reasonably priced, though. The food looks good and is also a bit pricey; I haven't had any. A very clean, sleek bar with lots of tables inside and a few out. Overall a great place to get some good beers.",

    "text": "I came here on a recommendation from a beer-enthusiast/nascent pub proprietor while we were both drinking at Euston Tap. The Cask Pub and Kitchen is on a quiet street in Pimlico. The atmosphere seems a classic pub atmosphere that manages to avoid feeling totally generic. There's ample seating, from small tables to stools. I went on a Thursday evening and it was bustling, but not packed, and the clientele was mixed: \u00a0everyone from business professionals still in their suits to a younger and snappier crowd, plus a group of what looked to be some serious ale-drinkers. The beer selection is incredible. Their printed \"menu\" is more like a book, and with five tall refrigerators full of bottles and eleven (if I remember correctly) beers on draught it is no surprise that The Cask Pub is a beer-lover's kind of place. They do, however, also have a full bar serving liquors. I think five of the draught ales were BrewDog and three were Dark Star. Most of the rest were some wild looking German beers, too. I had two guest ales by Dark Star: \u00a0the Six Hop Ale and the Sussex Extra Stout, and was pleased by both. The Six Hop Ale is a stiff beer: \u00a0tons of hops dominate the flavors while enough malt is there to serve as a reference point. 6.5% ABV doesn't hurt either. According to Dark Star's website, it's February's monthly special, so get to The Cask and get it while you can. I think most of their ales rotate fairly regularly. My ale was reasonably-priced at \u00a33.40 per pint, a price that it hurts me to say I once paid for a pint of Red Stripe in a shitty club in Shoreditch. Oh, and the chips were good, too. And the music was inoffensive.\u00a310 minimum for cards.",
