Happened to be walking by, there was an employee standing outside offering crisps and salsa, so I sampled. Seemed good and decided to give the place a try. Two tacos, a burrito and a bag of crisps, I was sold. Chilango makes my list of Mexican places that I actually like. So far, it is only rivaled by one other place (Wahaca). The service was quick and friendly and they make everything to order, right in front of you! My only complaint was that regardless how good their salsas and guacamole are, the crisps I had were extremely stale. Wasn't sure what to think when they gave them out in a pre-packaged bag. However, they fully redeemed their selves by having Pacifico available, which is my absolute favorite Mexican beer.",

Having tried brands like Chipotle in the US it was about time that the UK got an equivalent. Chilango does amazing burritos made with fresh ingredients. Walking down a conveyor belt system, you get to choose how your burrito is made from the type of chilli sauce, to whether you want added extras like guacamole. The burritos are stuffed full and eating them can get quite messy, but then that's all part of the fun! The place is licensed so you can choose to have Mexican beer and margaritas with you meal, but the bottomless hibiscus juice is equally tempting.",

    "text": "Surprisingly...not awful. In fact, actually pretty good. I was initially turned off by the shiny bright Alice-in-neon-anime-wonderland colors since I'm used to a style of taqueria that's basically the grimier and dirtier the tastier and the more likely to be open at 2am to stumble after a drunken Mission bar hopping bender. Those neon pinks and greens would burn your eyes out after a bleary night of tequila shots and the smiling people behind the counter might give you the evil eye if you pass out with your face in a bowl of tortilla chips. Not that I would ever do that. However, after sampling a marinated pork burrito, I'm pleasantly happy with the outcome. We waited for the sauteed veggies to be cooked up fresh, so I stood and eyed the tins of food for a while. I was tempted by the actual pinkness in the medium-rare steak but ended up going for the really good quality pork, which was soft and tender if not impressively flavorful. I noticed real hand-mashed Haas guacamole with avocado chunks (not the pureed green mushy-peas-esque drivel from some other spots), and enjoyed an actually lip-tingling spicy green salsa as well. \u00a0Cilantro rice, sour cream, good cheese, salsa fresca and a steamed tortilla all melded quite well in my book.I'd like to give 3.5 stars, since I think I gave El Burrito 3 and this was waayyy better. But hey, I'm a fan. Chilango, you're just a little too shiny but your food is an enjoyable surprise.",

That said, Chilango probably make the best burrito I've had in London. I like how they've got the multiple flavour thing going on in their food, what with the marinated meat (veggie options too), choices of beans (pinto or black), salsas (mild -hot), options of salads and guacamole (how can you not include it?). They are licensed so you get to have your Modelo Especial with your meal, which is pretty cool, I thought. They've designed the place quite interestingly. Kind of \"hip\" Mexican, playing off that wrestling type theme. I should stress that this is doesn't compare to the likes of Mestizo or Mercado, two proper Mexican restaurants (where you'd better NOT be ordering a burrito!), but it does Tex-Mex fantastically. Pros- great tasting food- licensed- nicely designed- better than Mexi-Cali to my tastebuds Cons- is a chain store (so much for supporting independent stores)- bit more pricey than similar type Tex-Mex's (Mexicali)",

Price wise Chilango is comparable with it's two main competitors here in London, which means it isn't exactly super cheap.Only minus with this place would be that if you come relatively late they might be out of shrimps, or guacamole (which happens at Chipotle too).

    "text": "A craze for burritos is sweeping through London town. 2010 may have been the year of the underground burrito (albeit with numerous front page articles about how underground and unknown it all was) but 2011 is the year when the masses will gobble up burritos like they were kebabs. Anyway, my burrito order: Chicken please (cheapest at just below \u00a37), salsa, no guacamole(yuck) and both cheese and sour cream (of course). Wrapped up and plonked rather unceremoniously into a paper lined plastic basket, it didn't stun me with its size, as I was expecting from other's comments. However, once I started unwrapping my prize from its foil coverings I realised why it was known as a beast. Almost too big to fit my mouth around, I think it may well be impossible to eat without making a mess. But if you can ignore the rice and beans landing on your dry clean only dress at regular intervals, then the burrito itself isn't too bad. But, when the focus is on devouring food without causing some kind of structural fault to occur, the foods flavour itself becomes a sideshow.  I went for the mildest option, which hopefully explains the lack of strong flavour from any part of the burrito. The chicken was nice, as were the beans. The tortilla was warm and moist. In all it was very nice. Nice of course, being a word which damns with faint praise. It hasn't put me off burritos for life, but, combined with a rather steep price for what is essentially a wrap wrapped in foil, I wouldn't make the journey to Upper Street purely for it. I have been since to the new Chancery Lane Chilangos, and had a steak burrito, which was better, but I still don't think it's worth the price.",

Chilango is a modern twist to the Mexican restaurant, when it comes to design. The color pallet is that of lime green, bright pinks and blue and flowers climbing up the walls with their heads as light fixtures. Pretty cool really! More importantly though, is the food. After you want into this bright, modern eatery you just don't know if the food will be what you expected either. MY GOODNESS! It is even better than anticipated! All the food is put together right in front of you. You have a variety of choices from beans to sauces. They wrap it up tight and you are taken aback at the cost as it seems a little expensive for fast food and you are not even sure that 1 burrito will fill you up. Again, another surprise, because you can't even finish the thing! It is quality Mexican food!! The Grilled Chicken burrito is worth the \u00a35.90 and the loaded Nachos are incredible! Also, seriously one of the best guacamole dips I have ever had!! If you are craving Mexican (like I often do!) you have to head to Chilango on Upper Street in Angel or Fleet Street!

This means nothing to me. All I know is that when I bit into the thing and those flavours hit my taste buds, I clamped my lips together to suppress the soul wrenching moan of pleasure that was erupting within. It was good. It was real good.For the less hank you can get smaller taco's for around \u00a31.80, or tortilla chips and salsa. But for me it will always be a stacked buritto, drenched in Chilula. Next time I may order a Corona with it too.",

    "text": "After reading many of the reviews, it seems pretty clear that anybody giving this place more than 3 stars is only basing it on the fact that you really can't find good Mexican food in London (so this place kinda just has to do). Anybody who is PROPERLY reviewing this place most likely is basing it off of PROPER Mexican food and acknowledging that this is simply NOT Mexican food. When you come from Southern California and lived within a half hour drive of the Mexican border, it's just not right to rate such a place with anything higher than 3 stars. I would be wronging all the Cali restaurants ending in -bertos that I've come to love.I do think it's interesting how there are loads of 'Mexican' joints popping up all over London, but I wonder if they're actually owned by any Mexicans?? As another Yelper put it, this is basically Chipotle, which can be good if you're itchin' for a gringo-ized version of Mexican food. (which actually sometimes, I do...and that is why I didn't give this place any lower than 3 stars)",

When we said it was my wife's birthday, several staff members jumped in and not only wished her a happy one but also showed incredible generosity with our order. What was just an offhand meal turned into a really enjoyable one. You always like to feel that the food that's being prepared for you is being done so with love. And yes, the burritos were awesome.

    "text": "I was always a little dishonest with myself when it came to burritos. Sure, I loved them. Sometimes I had them for lunch, then again for dinner. I've certainly had weeks in which I consumed at least one every single day. But I could live without them. Right?After all, I had no choice: I was moving to London. Hardly the world's burrito capital. Burritos would have to be replaced by mushy peas. Otherwise I'd never survive.Well, it turns out that the no-burritos plan was an arrogant fantasy. I need burritos. I can't imagine being without them. When I'm not eating one, I'm certainly thinking about eating one. They consume me, just as I consume them.Fortunately, London is now teeming with burrito options. Sure, they may be the equivalent of methadone to SF's heroin, but there is a reason methadone exists: because it is a perfectly satisfactory fix.Thus, this may seem to be a backhanded compliment, but here goes anyways: as far as London burritos go, this is just about the top of the line. All ingredients appear and taste incredibly fresh. Good tomatoes, guacamole, meat, etc. They certainly feel healthier than burritos from home. Consistency is high, which is important considering how often I eat here. Finally, I've noticed more than a few times that the service is particularly friendly in a relaxed, unforced sort of way. Good vibes all around.So thank the good Lord that this place is just down the street from me, as I'm not sure I could survive the upcoming winter without it.",

    "text": "'Fresh Mex' you say? Yes, Chilango is fresh mexican rather than dodgy deep-fried tack-fests. It's a refreshing change to enjoy 'proper food' from a type of Taco Bell-Chiquito fast food theme-monster of a restaurant. Ditch the dodgy theme cantina with cheap sombreros and get to a Chilango to eat proper fresh, great quality food that can be eaten in a hurry (or sometimes enjoyed with a chilled cerveza). The burritos here are spectacular, especially the chicken and steak. Also the staff are surprisingly joyous which is a nice treat as you queue school-dinners style to pick out your dream burrito combo. The Chilango guys who run things seem to be really into their customers and I went down to one of their 'tasting' nights which was a genuine opportunity to try a new recipe for their tacos. I sat at the table last May and tried 12cm and 15cm corn tacos (these guys are very precise about getting it just right). They had some proper old-school Mexicans grind up corn (not flour) to make these special soft tortillas by going through a traditional production process called 'nixtamalization'. Here's a pic from wikipedia of the production process involved upload.wikimedia.org/wik\u2026Yeah, nixtamalization hombre, stick that in your taco! The corn tacos were fab, as have been the standard flour tortillas that i've eaten at Chilango since (quite a lot). I'm also a massive fan of their guacamole that they mash-up fresh every few hours (It's even better than mine: that makes me mad). The Chilango guys are always doing crazy stuff and keep entertaining things going on their little corners of the web, in fact they introduced me to a mariachi cover song that I sometimes finish my DJ sets with. Seems appropriate for you to listen to at the end of my review of Chilango: the burrito champions.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=_If7\u2026",

Whether it's real down-to-earth Mexico-Mexican, slightly Americanized Tex-Mex or California-Mex, or just random burrito houses that just throw things in a tortilla, roll it up, and call it done Mexican, I'm a snob. I can't help it. I lived far too long in New Mexico.Anyway, I stopped by Chilango before heading to Karaoke to meet some friends. Ashley V. had the same idea as she was already there working on her burrito when I came in. I went up, ordered a burrito and joined her! I had the pork belly with beans, \"hot\" salsa, and cheese and guac. First of all, the pork was slightly chewy. Tasty, but chewy. Second, the \"hot\" salsa is not hot. Why advertise something has hot if it's not. I get that people have different levels of tolerance, and they like different things, but that's why you also have a mild and medium salsa, yes? So make your hot salsa HOT. As I ate my burrito, I started putting their habanero sauce on it as well. I watched Ashley look shocked at the amount I put on. I think she thought I was crazy. Or as it turns out, their \"very hot\" habanero sauce isn't really very hot at all. It's definitely spicy and added a great flavor and some heat, but it wasn't very hot.I'd probably go back and try it again or if I needed something quick in the area. Personally, I don't understand what the excitement is about. It's a pretty standard burrito. I'm sure there are worse out there, but I know I've had a whole lot better.",

An eating area seemed to be inspired by Sergeant Pepper and the Kaleidoscope left taste and touch as the only principal sensations to potentially bugger up.The yelpers are always going on about how there is nothing Mexican in London of any value and yet more and more burrito places keep popping up. This is probably the most convenient for me and the psychedelic decor makes it the most \u00a0memorable. The food is fresh and reasonably priced as takeaway food with excellent, great and friendly service. The grilled chicken burrito was a bit of a tardis, small and shiny on the outside but cavernous on the inside. It was also far tastier than the alternatives in the area. The only downsides were that the tortilla chips were a little expensive and when we went there was no guacamole.I would definitely return and this time time I won't be confused by the decor....I promise",

Instead of slush puppies they have frozen maragarita, and instead of really junky food they have burritos, which is much better for you than a burger. It's a complete meal in a roll, and pimp it up with some salsa and guacamole and you're laughing! Chilango is the perfect place to go to with a bunch of friends and have a few drinks whilst being able to eat somewhere really cheap. The prices are rock bottom and you are paying for really nice food. Nothing is deep fried and swimming in oil which for cheap eats is pretty hard. I think Chilango is going to prove a hard act to follow.",

While their burritos are good, and much better than what you will get from a street vendor and using very tasty ingredients, the price is quite high considering it really is fast food, served to you McDonalds style on a plastic tray, with the burrito wrapped in kitchen foil. The Aqua Fresca as well was somewhat artificial tasting, reminding me of a regular sugar laden colouring saturated drink. Whilst they've occupied a niche market for themselves (how many fast food burrito places in London do you see?) they're somewhat exploiting the hype of something new by not really giving much for charging quite a bit for it. I'm hoping more competitors open up to provide some more choice in London! Reviewed byThe London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk/200\u2026",

    "text": "My favourite joint for lunch on the go during a busy workday. I normally have the Grilled Chicken salad primarily because I find it easier to eat! \u00a0For a regular salad under \u00a36 is good value for money. Double meat costs \u00a32.50 extra. Go big only if you have a huge appetite. They do Chicken, Steak, Pork and Prawns. Cost vary but mostly around six quid mark for a meal. It could be a Burrito, Nudo (or naked burrito), Salad or Tacos.The set up is that standard Mexican joint like the Chipotle or Tortilla but the flavours just burst through every bite you take. Conveyor belt model with multiple persons servicing. Spice Rice, Black or Pinto Beans, Grilled Bell Peppers, Three sauces of varying \u00a0heat factor is perfect match for your food. I personally go for a mix of mild (salsa) and hot. The chicken (and presumably other meats as well) is seasoned and cooked to perfection. A dash of sour cream and cheese and their own proprietary dressing makes my salad perfect. I skip the Guacamole as it is charged \u00a31 and is a shame. Having said that is quite good and is better tasting then others out there.Decent selection of drinks including home made Lemonade and beers and some interesting lunch combos. They experiment new recipes from time to time and they are currently doing a slow cooked shoulder of pork which I got to taste today and it was pretty good.If you have been to the other standard Mexican on the go places you will know what to expect however the flavours will blow you away and the Islington branch will transport you to Mexico the way it is decked up, check out the seating upstairs which is creatively done! Last but not least the happy smiling welcoming staff complete the experience!Highly recommended!",

On a hungry afternoon, I passed by and ordered the supposedly best burrito they have: the surf and turf \u00a37.95) - steak and prawns. Steak was reheated pieces of precooked, hard bits of meat; prawns were cooked on the spot. The other typical burrito ingredients, like the rice and beans, were very plain and didn't taste authentic. The toppings, from the veggies, to a tired pico de gallo, to the cheddar, were also just barely okay for me. Inside the burrito, the reheated \"steak\" was hard and way too chewy. The prawns were passable. I didn't find myself looking forward to the next bite and just got through it out of hunger.A side of Guacamole was plain. The salsas were actually really good. The chips were solid too. Service is friendly. Sorry Chilango, I wanted to like you more but the ingredients are just not good enough for me, even for a bite at a fast food joint.",

    "text": "With all the hype, I thought it was time to break out of my Tortilla trance and try Chilango. This was a mistake.First things first, burrito shops are not Mexican food. Burrito shops are in a category of themselves creatively called 'burrito shops.' Perhaps one day this will be understood of the great people of Britain and further afield.Keeping in line with what I order at Tortilla (and what I ordered at Chipotle the day prior), I ordered a naked burrito or burrito bowl or, as it is called at Chilango, a lunchbox, or something like that. It actually took me a bit of time searching the electronic flashing menu to find what I was looking for which is a problem in itself.Side note: Also, I don't know what it is about shops located on this part of Upper Street but Chilango and Starbucks have the layouts backwards. Consumers have to walk past the tills to get to the ordering counter and then backtrack to get to the tills.For \u00a35.99, the legendary lunchbox included a 'naked burrito' and a cup of homemade lemonade. I didn't need the lemonade but I didn't see any way of ordering sans lemonade, so lemonade it was.Now, I order the naked burrito to save on calories, so I was a bit surprised when ~10 tortilla chips were thrown on top of my naked burrito. They were thrown so fast that I did not have time to stop them! Also, I suppose if you are a person who likes both cheese and sour cream on your naked or loaded burrito, then \u00a35.99 is probably a deal because Tortilla has an extra charge if you want both cheese and sour cream. I don't eat sour cream so, no benefit for me.Anyway, I paid and made my way over to the long communal table to fetch my straw, plasticware and a napkin. Hot sauce bottles were located on the table with tiny plastic cups to fill with said hot sauce. This setup reminded me of Taco Cabana in the US and it was a bit strange to be reaching over other diners to grab a hot sauce bottle.So, the food. Well, the chicken is the fattiest chicken I've ever consumed at a burrito shop. Every single piece had a blob of fat attached to it which I had to pick off. The fatty chicken killed the meal for me. The chicken was also spicy - more spicy than Chipotle or Tortilla and far too spicy for a young child to eat, so parents take note.The packaging, or lunchbox, was great. It was compostable and was easy to eat out of. I noticed that the lid could easily be ripped off and used as a plate, so that's what I did. I piled on the fatty chicken blobs and tortilla chips onto the lid to be discarded later.The lemonade was still lemonade and was good but tasted a whole-helluva-lot like supermarket still lemonade. Also, lemonade should always be served over lots of ice, so I think they should offer to add ice to the cup. I admired that the till dude referred to me as a senorita but it was sort of corny at the same time and also burrito shops do not equal Mexican food, so no need for Spanish lingo.Will not return.",

Always have full ingredients hot and at the ready. \u00a0The 'burrito artist' was going to scoop the last of the chicken into my burrito before I caught him. \u00a02. The black beans were sticky and undercooked, closer to re-fried. \u00a03. The guacamole (which costs extra) was fairly bland. 4. Tap water containers were empty. \u00a0So, all seems fixable with a little hustle and someone watching over the whole operation.",

This place is pretty great and I know of no other similar enterprise. It really offers something no one else really does here -- fast, fresh and delicious burritos that are as big as your forearm.This time I tried the braised pork and FAR preferred it to the steak. It was juicy and marinated to perfection. I would also like to update everyone that I can now finish an entire burrito in one sitting. Huzzah!",

    "text": "As much as I love London, the Mexican food here makes me want to take the first Virgin Atlantic flight back to California. Contrary to what a disturbingly popular chain would lead you to believe (ahem, Wahaca), Lancashire cheese, new potatoes, feta, English peas, and savoy cabbage DO NOT belong in tacos, burritos, or quesadillas. After months of trying different \"Mexican\" establishments here only to find the offerings too bland, too greasy, too sweet (Benito's Hat's beef), or just too incorrigibly wrong, I was elated to discover Chilango in Angel. The first time I tentatively ordered a chicken burrito with black beans and guacamole here, I grimaced when I saw how carelessly the burrito was wrapped. Despite this shortcoming in technique, however, Chilango makes one fine burrito. The grilled chicken is juicy and flavourful, and the guacamole is the best I have had in London (outside of my own kitchen, of course ;)). With liberal dousings of hot sauce, the Chilango burrito is the closest you can get to the exceptional burritos found in San Francisco's Mission district. If you are in the mood for something lighter, the salad with grilled chicken and guacamole is also a winning combination that you can eat for lunch or dinner without worry of contracting a food baby.I would love to give Chilango five stars, but there are just a few minor issues they need to sort out first:1) The arrangement of ingredients inside the burrito: the ingredients are not well dispersed across the tortilla, so it might take 10 bites of pure chicken before reaching any guacamole. 2) The wrapping of the burrito: they could take a lesson from Bombay Burrito on how to tightly wrap a burrito so that the bottom is not a soggy, sloppy mess that inevitably ends up running down your hands. Maybe this post would help? thekitchn.com/how-to-wra\u20263) The consistency in their seasonings: recently I had the chicken salad with guacamole and black beans twice within a week (don't judge), and the second time was considerably less flavourful than the first. The first salad was purchased on a Thursday evening, and the second on a Tuesday for lunch. Tuesday's lunch was the first time I noticed the inconsistency, so hopefully it was just a fluke.Overall, I am so happy to have found Chilango in London. As long as they never compromise on their ingredients and recipes, I will remain a loyal customer.(Most recent visit in October 2013)",

Sure it has a seating area upstairs but that room is so cramped and the chairs so uncomfortable that its not worth going up.Having said all these bad words, the food here is simply awesome. They don't serve a great variety of dishes. You have a chicken burrito, a veg one, a steak burrito and one made of pork. I have tried all the 3 meats ... and i have no complaints ... each one of them is good. The quantity is pretty good. One will usually suffice for dinner ... if you are very hungry, then you might need 1.5. They serve unlimited coke for a fixed price ... which is an added attraction for a coke addict like me :)A filling, wonderful meal for less than \u00a37 ... what more do you want from a snack joint ?",

Anyway, YUMMMM burrito! I wasn't very impressed with the guacamole...it wasn't bad, just not great.

The nice thing about the tasting session was I got to find out about lots of ways to customize your burrito e.g. did you know that you can have half and half of the different fillings such as half chicken and half pork. And that you can mix the salsas together so you can get the fresh tang of the mild with its chunky tomatoes plus an extra hit of heat from the hot? It's hard to not just pick from the available options when you can feel the death rays from the rest of the queue boring into the back of your head but I'm assured there will be secret off menu items coming soon so don't forget to ask next time you're in but shh don't say I told you!",

We'd heard nothing but good things about this place from friends and family so we went with high hopes. And we weren't disappointed. Good burritos, reasonable service, free refills. Winning combination. It's also a good sign that they had agua fresca. My chicken burrito was tasty and well made, and Deanne clearly enjoyed her carnitas burrito. Rounded off with chips and salsa fresca and it was well worth the trek. Best burrito I've had in London to date. When the cashier rang up the total, I thought wow, that's pretty steep! but as we ploughed through our burritos, I broke it down: \u00a316 for 2 burritos, so sodas with free refills and chips and salsa ain't bad. Not great but not bad, especially for London. Few pieces of (very minor) feedback for the Chilango team: - I don't think sour cream and cheese are mutually exclusive. Don't discourage people from having both. - maybe create a salsa bar so people can try the three (excellent) salsas you have on offer. - We may have had the Sunday crew but the team behind the counter could afford to smile from time to time.",

    "text": "The restaurant: A veritable colour sensation that left my eyes suitably entertained and my belly full of medium rare steak dolloped in guacamole and sour cream. These Mexican quirky eateries are popping up all over the capital, it was not so long ago Qype had a fandango at Benito's Hat and this restaurant was equally as impressive. Of course, a huge thank you to tikichris for putting on such a show, where we were robustly fed and watered with Jose Cuervo, after a lovely demonstration by a company member who dispelled the myth that tequila is only ever served in plastic cups at student bars. It was an insightful education indeed, as we were offered many different types of the universal brand.

    "text": "My first try in a Mexican restaurant in London (and maybe in Europe?) and it was a success: a huge chicken burrito as a dinner make me full until the day after 12.00 ! Exclusively fresh ingredients and hand made wrap. The guacamole is made with the avocado as FIRST ingredient !!! which make it so tasty and smooth! I'd really really enjoy eating there and staff turn the experience even better thanks to their smile !+: Chips/Burrito with Corrona, Tequila & Margarita: definitly enjoyable! Decoration change from the typical and traditional sombreros. The place is COLORFUL and very modern. Chilango made some events this months to get notoriety, my friends know this place and talk about it as well ! word of mouth is working ;) If you are hungry and need fresh & consistent food: GO FOR IT !",

The restaurant has an air of fast food about it but that only explains the time it takes for you to get served as nothing else can be associated with such a term.The food is of very high quality and the portions are massive, I am sure I ate my own body weight in one Burrito!! I liked the fact that I could choose how spicy I wanted it, I went for medium and was glad I had an iced Margarita to wash it down as it was fairly hot.By the way the Margarita's are also fab, not too strong which for me is perfect.Finally, the staff were the icing on the cake, a very helful smiley bunch!If Mexican is your thing, then you must give this place a go!",

A fast-food concept, but with better food and premises than your normal fast-food experience - the \u00a35.90 for a big chicken burrito seemed reasonable to me. Next time I'm in the Angel area and peckish for a quick but substantial bite to eat, I think I know where I'll be going.",

    "text": "The second Chilango's I've been too, the first was in Fleet Street. This one also follows the winning recipe of fast, but extremely tasty food, made right in front of you as you choose the yummy fillings to go into your giant sized burrito. Once again I had roast pork as my base and once again I wasn't disappointed. I held back on the cheese and sour cream and instead chose salsa, medium hot sauce and guacomole. Very good value food, at just under six quid for an almost too large burrito. Speedy service, great mexican primary colours and so fresh you'd think you were on a street in Mexico City rather than Upper Street. I wish them well with their new venture and bet the people on Upper Street will soon be flocking to their door.",

It appears the Chilango team have revamped the place, but in essence it is the same place. More colourful, better PR. They kickstarted the the new launch with a free burrito day, which was much appreciated by many credit crunch hit londoners! Sercice was quick, and the food was excellent. I fully recommend this place for a quick, filling and cheap meal before a movie. Maybe they should create a movie special menu?",

    "text": "Used to be Mucho Mas, recently re-branded and re-opened as Chilango. I think it fills a much-needed middle-of-the-road Mexican food gap in London: it's fast food, but not too cheap. Walk up to the counter and they'll make your burrito or nachos or whatever you like right there in front of you. Steak burrito for \u00a35.90 might sound like a lot at first, but this thing was huge. And much tastier than I expected, to be honest - you can pick your fillings, even down to the type of beans. Warm earth-toned walls, fun Lucha Libre wall art, eat in or takeaway. If you need a quick bite in Islington I think this is a great choice.",

So don't go there for a romantic night with your new girl! That said I like the place and the food. Their chicken burrito is just yummy and seems very fresh. I love their guacamole. And the fact that they use fresh coriander in my burrito. Whenever I have had one of their burritos it feels like I'm going to overdose on protein due to the huge amount of meat, beans, cheese and sour cream. My kind of comfort food!They have cheap Margaritas and Mexican beer to.",

    "text": "This restaurant really plays with your senses. Your sense of sight is on overload when you are walking up this place from the street, because it is the brightest building in the area, so it is very hard to miss. As well, once inside, the bright pinks, greens, yellows and lets not forget the Luchador masks, are quite the sight. Your ears are in for a party because the place is very busy, and very loud, which is always a good thing for business, showing they must be doing something right. Finally, and most importantly, your mouth, which is in for a fiesta with flavour. I had a pork burrito, and at first glance, i thought a burrito could not fill a man of my size, but it is surprisingly filling, considering i eat like a person suffering from obesity or tape worms. The pork was soft and juicy, the medium heat brown/black bean sauce (pardon my lack of culinary terminology) was incredible. Furthermore, the cafeteria experience, lining up and receiving food like a child receiving a school dinner, is quite fun. Overall, the price is about right for the quality of meal, and if i am ever in the area of this wonderful establishment, i will allow my senses to have another experience in flavour country.",

However, the steak burrito I had was one of the best burritos I have ever had. The meat was perfect, just the right amount of spice, the rice was nice and light and the guacamole was very fresh. So tasty! And the nachos on the table? I was struggling to grab chips as there was a mountain of toppings on it. Mm. And this was all before the tequila had hit me, so none of that any food you have when drunk is awesome here! ;-) I'll be sure to take my friends round next time we're in Angel. In fact, I might organize a trip of it. :-)",

    "text": "Chilango kind of falls somewhere between being a restaurant and a fast food joint. The prices are higher than your average burger flipper's but the food is also of a much better quality. I arrived at the burrito-making production line and did what I always do when I don't quite know the score - I asked the staff to give me what they would choose. It always works for me. The cheery peeps merrily filled a floury wrap with tasty chicken, rice, lettuce, sour cream and freshly-made guacamole. And it was so big, I couldn't finish it. This wouldn't be an everyday lunch haunt for me if I worked in the area - but it would be the place I would go for a weekly treat. I now wish I'd taken the leftovers away with me. Just writing about the place is making me a bit peckish.",

That said, I have never eaten one of their burritos other than struggling on the short walk between Chilango and Angel Station, but I most definitely would NOT stay in the quirky premise itself to eat my nice Burrito. But from my experiences, they have always been very good.The ingredients are very fresh. I usually go for their hot salsa, which is fantastic. Portions are substantial and food is tasteful. There is a branch of Tortilla just down the road, and I used to opt for that earlier, as Chilango just looks so odd from outside. I was told that this serves much better than Tortilla, and I now agree.",
