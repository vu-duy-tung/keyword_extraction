    "text": "Monopoly Pub Crawl - Stop #16 - Fleet Street (Red)Time to break into the red color group and what better place than Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese? This is my favourite pub on this crawl and is definitely not one to be missed. This is one of the oldest pubs in London, and as Ben Y said, it's in fact older than the USA. Yet despite its age, the Cheshire Cheese isn't a stodgy pub stuck in a different era, but rather a fairly vibrant seductive pub hidden in central London.The interior is segregated into a number of bars and seating areas which gives you quite a variety to choose from. We crowded into the beer bar area which offers a in house brew \u00a0that is light and hoppy (think Leffe) and quite delicious. You can also get your full range of Belgian and other top range beers. There are also some fruitier options for those that aren't partial to the bitter stuff.Dark wood panels cover the walls and are decorated with random bits that seem to be have been collected over the years. It gives you a feeling of calm and provides an oasis to relax after a busy day. Unfortunately, we had no such time and were off to the next one! But I'll definitely be back one day to really enjoy Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese as it deserves to be.",

I think what made this place unique is when we had to use the restroom that's in the basement and saw more stairs to head lower for more bar areas, and then it goes even lower and we are now drinking in a cave like area. This is the second oldest bar in London, so I figured it would be very touristy, but this to me, was my favorite relax spot for a pint or two or three.",

    "text": "#513 Having dined at plenty of old and historic establishments, I wasn't blown away by the antiquated architecture of the Cheshire Cheese. Instead, I found that the short ceilings and tiny steps kick-started my vertigo. Seriously, walking down to the cellar, I was slightly concerned that I might tip over and fall straight down the stairs! But, of course, that's a personal problem that the Cheshire Cheese can't help. Regardless, I was surprised that food was only served down in the cellar during the lunch hour. But, Adam B. and I had no problems with that. We actually went straight for the largest table just because we were in need of some sprawling time. We had to wait a little while for the rest of our party to show up, but I got myself a nice, bottled ginger ale to sip on and enjoyed soaking in the authentic British aura that the bar oozed all over. Once we were ready to order, I walked over to the bar to get myself a Scampi entree. Unfortunately, they tack on a 1-2% card fee to cover the credit card company's charge. So, I ended up paying about 12gbp for the Scampi and a side order of Calamari. The bartenders were nice enough to bring our orders directly to us since we were sitting right in front of the bar and it didn't take too long. My Scampi was absolutely delicious. It was fresh and fried to the perfect crisp. I couldn't even finish all of it! The chips were also a crispy delight, but the salad left a little to be wanted. You had the usual tossings, but they added too much vinaigrette and I ended up picking around most of it. I wouldn't say no to a second order of the Scampi though. There were hardly any parties when we first got there, but over time the place started to fill up. People were clearly eyeing our table, so we finished up quickly and headed out. I say that this place is worth the visit for the historical factor, but otherwise, it's just your usual pub!",

For the most part they are very similar.First and foremost, their beer is great and very reasonably priced. My wife loved the Teddy Lager (she is more of Blue Moon type). I got the Extra Stout and it was excellent. I can see why the English drink so much.Second, we fell in love with a dessert called Sticky Toffee Pudding. The locals get the pudding topping but we went with the ice cream. The size of the scoop of the ice cream did vary from pub to pub.Third, was the food. We tried different items each time (except we did order the Fisherman's pie and Bangers & Mash twice). The food was ok. Nothing special. The fish on the Fish & Chips were good but the Chips were not crisp. I would recommend getting regular peas instead of the Mushy Peas. I thought they would taste similar but they don't.In all the pubs you order at the bar and sometimes you pick up your own food and sometimes they bring it to you. Could be it depends on how busy it is.The service in all the places were very good and the female bar keepers were very friendly.",

But I thought this place was quite solid, and central to many of the offices in the City.Per the other reviews, I went down to the basement bar (down some series of levels and twists and turns -- at least two floors below street level) to grab dinner and beers. Sure, many of the accents I heard were American or otherwise foreign -- but London is a global financial hub, after all. I ordered a Shepherd's Pie, which came with fries and veggies, and a pint of the extra stout house beer. Both were quite good, and the total for both was GBP 9.65. Not bad, for this area of the city. I went back for a chocolate pudding and a pint of cider, and the total for that was GBP 6.95 (mainly due to the higher price of cider vs. stout). The chocolate pudding with custard was actually really awesome -- quite memorable, and a great deal at GBP 2.70. The bar is unpretentious, the service decent, the decor interesting, and the buzz is quite nice. I'm sure I'll be back before I leave London.",

    "text": "In light of the 2012 Olympics, I've decided to review some places in London that I've tried out to help our fellow travelers find places to eat with that traditional British flair. I found Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese Pub on Yelp, as a devoted follower I was happy to see that this place had a lot of character to it. It is one of the oldest pubs in England rebuilt in 1667 as it burned down in the London Fire so you can trust you will really get a feel of cultural England in this place. Dark and kind of dimly lit with wood that has warped through the ages this pub, like The Blue Anchor, is a pub out of time. A pub that has been frequented by old English author Samuel Johnson, and perhaps more famously Charles Dickens, this pub gives you a feel and taste of old English HistoryThe food here is relatively good, staying true to the traditional British foods, there are plenty of helpings of traditional roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, lamb shank, and roast pheasant. The food is excellently prepared with a heaping helping of potatoes on the side. The food was well cooked, most came with a lovely gravy. The man serving us was an elderly man who seemed to be very happy to help and incredibly knowledgeable about the pub itself. Overall, not a bad choice. I, myself, am not a fan of traditional British food but if you're looking for a cultural experience and a pub with character I would recommend Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese. It is small and the dining room is a bit small and cramped. There are several rooms separated for the pub and a eating area, and a restaurant so make sure you're in the right place. It is a Samuel Smith Pub so it only serves that specific brand of Beer and Cider. All in all, a good restaurant with a Doctor Who time traveling feel. It is, a pub that truly has stood through the ages and earns the albeit hokey title of \"Ye Olde.\"",

This pub deserves it because it represents a time capsule of an era really long lost, of an easy going culture, with a dark and dingy atmosphere of the Victorian times and before, which although doesn't seem like not something to be romanticised about in our electronic age, but yet is something we search for all the time - to be secluded in a hole engrossed in our own thoughts without being barged in upon constantly by notifications. That very feeling is there in this pub, unchanged in its dark wooden surroundings, an almost Gothic feel captured like a photograph, and all this, even though it has fewer seats than one would like, making it quite frustrating to visit it on a sunny afternoon. The beer/ales are good, and on future visits, will try out the food as well.",

Another famous celeb is the parrot from \"Polly want a cracker\" fame...he can be found stuffed and on a shelf in the first room after entering the place. Also loved that there were a few fireplaces with coals burning warmly in some of the rooms. All in all a very neat, very cool pub.

    "text": "Literature nerd alert!! One of the oldest pubs in London, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was the drinking establishment of choice for famous writers. Legend has it that Charles Dickens wrote A Tale of Two Cities here, W. B. Yeats threw down some poetry, and even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was inspired by a proper pint of Ale. The very environment of the pub arouses one's creativity. With dim lights, low entryways, and a fascinating labyrinth-like layout it is no wonder authors were driven to write. Although they don't really have a great selection of pints, their ales were creamy and tasty and certainly offered a greater variety of Samuel Smith beers than we're used to in the states. As a good little tourist I had the fish and chips with mushy peas, and my wife had the steak and ale pie. As my first meal in London, it did not disappoint! The fish was crispy, tarter sauce tangy, and the pie was meaty and flavorful.A truly magnificent place with friendly bartenders and a rich history.",

Located on Fleet Street, keep your eyes peeled when looking for this place. It's tucked away in an alley and can be easily missed. We walked right past the alley a few times before finally finding it. There are three levels, you have to take a flight of really tricky stairs to go to each. You literally have to hunch down to get through - I hit my head going back up when we were leaving, so be extra careful. We went down to the 2nd level and found some seats. The place is really charming. Loved the ambiance - it's dark and candle-lit, but still very lively. Definitely felt historic. As we sat down, there was a huge group of Brits trickling in for what seemed like a family reunion; they were having an awesome time. It kind of felt like we were watching a British movie, haha! You seat yourself and to grab drinks and food, you have to go down to the basement level, which was my absolute favorite. Sadly, it was way too packed, so we couldn't find a seat down there. Their fish & chips were DELICIOUS! Just what I had been searching for. Definitely the best I had during my trip and believe me, I tried it at several popular places.",

We were seated in the cozy corner, which was this really cute little corner surrounded by curtains. Service was fine. We had the cheese plate and the goat cheese salad (had to go with cheese, given the name). The salad was just ok - small serving & not much of a salad to speak of, just some lettuce surrounding the cheese. Cheese plate was also quite small, but the cheese selection was ok. The cider, however, was lovely. Would recommend this place for its ambiance and drinks selection, but would not order food again.",

Rebuilt in 1667 after the Great Fire, this historic pub can claim Charles Dickens and Mark Twain among its former patrons. Everything from the alleyway entrance to the winding stairs leading to multiple basement levels gives you the sense that Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is from a different era.We settled in the basement, which resembled more of a dungeon, for lunch. Wanting to get a taste of traditional pub fare, I couldn't turn down trying ye famous steak and kidney pie. The flavor of kidney overpowered the steak and pretty much anything else on the plate. It was then that I realized that I'm not a fan of kidney. On the other hand, the fish & chips were outstanding. But, it would have been nice to see them have some homemade tartar sauce rather than have them in packets. All the specials are \u00a38 and most of the main courses are \u00a35-6, which makes this pub quite the affordable place to eat. The portions are also quite large so the half pints of beer or cider are perfect with the meals.",

I came here on a rainy day when I was wandering around London by myself. I had gone to a couple of places early in the morning and managed to check off a ton of things on my list including an awesome little coffee spot that I found near this area to have a sit down, legitimate, cup of joe - complete with latte art and all.When I showed up here, it was tipping 11:30am. I was pretty much the only person in here because they had opened at 11am. The lunch service was not available until 12, and I had other places to be on my crazy whirlwind tour. So of course, I sat down at the bar, and ordered a beer.Yup. 11:30am. On a Monday. I did that. And guess what, IT WAS AWESOME.The beer was actually quite delicious, and sort of refreshing as I gazed outwards on this rainy day in London. The inside had this musty but comforting smell to it, like something familiar and safe. There was a nice fire place, but unfortunately it wasn't that warm. The bartender was more than happy to make conversation while I took DSLR shots of my single little beer, but alas I was done in less than 10 minutes. Still, great place, I wish I could come back when it was more happening!",

The \"new\" bar, only 110 years old, is in the cellar.A place like this would be worth checking out just for the history, but to have a place like this on Fleet Street that was NOT setting out to gouge tourists made our visit even more special. Prices were actually quite reasonable, the staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the kidney pie and local ale made for a nice stop in London. We saw enough locals in the cellar bar playing cards, chatting and drinking, that I could almost see another life if ancestors hundreds of years back hadn't bailed.A fantastic place to visit and grab a pint.",

Being a Samuel Smith's pub it has a limited range of drinks, but one pint of the Alpine larger at a very cheap price, and you will not mind. The dark and dank interior is something not too dissimilar to a Harry Potter film, and really gives an excellent old world ambience to this pub. Truly my favourite pub in London.",

These days, it's a tight squeeze, but get your elbows in, and find a place at one of the bars, and you'll get served soon enough. When you get sick of the being hemmed in/too hot, walk down to The Old Bank of England, a Fuller's ale and pie house a short hop from here and get yourself a pint of Discovery to freshen up.",

As you can imagine, this pub is straight out of an episode of Blackadder or the pages of Dickens, who I'm sure drank here since all the writers did, including, famously, Dr Johnson. This is a Samuel Smiths pub, so the beer is the cheapest and best in London. Their cheapest pint is \u00a31.80 (yorkshire bitter)and the most expensive bottle is \u00a33.50 (oatmeal stout i think). There is brilliant food served in every bar (steak and kidney pud will finish you off) and if you can manage to get a seat in the tiny restaurant (no bookings) you can enjoy pheasant for a tenner! Mind you don't chomp on a bit of shot though. Smiths make their own spirits, so their shorts and mixers are cheap as well. The upstairs bits are reserved for private bookings, and are very nice indeed, and the fantastic cellar bar is closed on the weekends, but after a couple of pints, which should cost less than a fiver (in central London!) you won't care. Particularly if you're sat next to the real coal fire.",

The pies are great and for \u00a35.50 you can make a meal of it which includes a potato side (chips or mash), and either mushy peas, beans or salad. Although good value, it can be a bit hit and miss, with the last time I was there just under a month ago, there were huge lumps of partially cooked potato that had not been mashed properly - really put me offbut then again at least they are using real potato and not that packet mash I suppose.

The first thing you can imagine as you enter the unassuming door in the side alley off Fleet Street, is that this is a very traditional pub, with one excellent facet to it. However - if that's all you imagine, you're aiming too low. This pub has so many facets it's a veritable engagement rock. The key to this pub is that there is an element to satisfy nearly all types of pub clientele. There is a small snug to the right of the entrance that feels like it was designed for village regulars. To the left, there is a pub restaurant area. Straight ahead, and it's a standard pub - mostly standing room only, long bar running along one wall. But it doesn't stop there. Upstairs there is a cosy boothed restaurant area that puts you in mind of Noel Coward's Still Life (latterly the movie Brief Encounter). Each booth has coat hooks on the outside, and you could almost imagine yourself conducting an illicit liaison on the Orient Express. Downstairs and you are back in time again, as the Cheese has converted some of it's old cellars into more seating area - with low, arched ceilings and warm lighting. Descend further and you are in the lowest bar, with long benches, stone flooring and whitewashed walls. I'm a big fan of Sam Smiths - and while I haven't had any issues with short pints - I can't recall the bar staff being particularly friendly or attentive. In fact, on one occasion it felt like I was being ignored. That aside - it is a lovely pub - and the staff problems are all fixable. I'll give this place 4 stars - only to encourage folk to visit here at least once. It's a bit of history, and an awesome place to be able to tell folk Yup - I know that pub..",

The food was really good too, very unexpected. It's pretty traditional fare so don't go ording a pizza or cheeseburger. My wife ordered the fish & chips and I got the kidney pudding, which was outstanding. The ambience is delightful and rich of history, you can literally feel the history of this place. Gorgeous woodwork and original stained glass windows are located throughout. This place has multiple levels so be sure to take a little tour. Besides having good food, great ambiance, and having a pint with Dr. Samuel Johnson, this place is OLDE school. They still heat the dining room with coal, which accounts for the smokey atmosphere.

I have enjoyed multiple university parties in here, and many more quiet pints with a friend.

Staff are friendly and efficient, and the Alpine beer is exactly what you'd expect: Cheap and refreshing. The food isn't all that, just your typical pub fare, fish and chips and some pies; but the atmosphere is so snug and happy that although you come for the cheer, you will stay for the food.

It wasn't bad, but I felt that the flavors could have been a little more pronounced. I have had better English food, but I suppose most English food is somewhere along the same line of excitement. Not horrible, but I wouldn't be back for the food.The environment was very nice and cozy though! We sat in a booth with walls that went up pretty high so we got a lot of privacy and it was a unique experience.",

    "text": "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was our first pub stop in London and it delivered as promised. \u00a0Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666, is one of the oldest pubs in London. There are several famous literary figures associated with the place: Oliver Goldsmith, Mark Twain, Alfred Tennyson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and G.K. Chesterton are all said to have been 'regulars'. \u00a0Ye Olde Cheshire \u00a0is absolutely charming and crammed with tons of history. \u00a0The low door entries and tiny steps give you an idea of how short people used to be! \u00a0It took us a few moments to locate the dining area. Initially we thought the stand up bar area was the entire pub! \u00a0If you walk downstairs, towards the bathrooms, you will see two levels of dining areas. \u00a0We lucked out and were able to grab the last table as a group was leaving. \u00a0Since our table seated 8-10 we decided to be neighborly and invited another couple to join our table.The atmosphere is very casual. \u00a0Order drinks and food at the bar and the bartender will give you a pager while you wait for your food order. \u00a0Whoever said English food sucks is absolutely nuts! \u00a0Our fish and chips and Shepherd's Pie were awesome!!! \u00a0I did skip eating the lackluster peas and carrots on the plates, but overall I was very impressed with our \"pub grub\"! \u00a0The prices for our meals were also very resonable.It was tempting to spend the rest of the night here, but we had other plans in Hampstead and eventually had to leave. \u00a0I highly recommend checking out this pub if you are visitng London and want to experience an old fashioned English Pub!",

It has a list of all the past and present kings and queens of England that have reigned during its time open which is quite an impressive list to say the leastA few mod cons have gone in since it opened with electric lights and plumbing being the major ones! The architecture has remained the same with the low ceilings and doorways so mind your headsThe brick work is fascinating with the arches and the old style wooden stools and table certainly don't take up much space but there isn't much room to swing a cat between the walls. There are a few sections which give it a feeling of space.Not bad food and a standard selection of ales available. I was there with a friend when it was quiet so no idea what the crowd is like at peak timesBy the way it's hidden away down a lane off the Main Street so you need to keep an eye out or you will simply walk straight on byWorth a visit if you are looking for a quirky tourist pub steeped in history, if only the walls could talk in this pub!",

It's great to imagine that this pub has been around when straws probably lined the road, and Lamb Street actually was a marketplace for sheep rather than home to investment firms. Visiting this tucked away pub is great for the imagination. There is an upstairs dining area which you need to book, but downstairs is a fairly roomy and atmospheric basement where you can tuck into a selection of traditional pub grub, washed down with a pint of ale, cider, or stout. The selection of food and drinks may not be extensive as the everyday modern pubs we are accustomed to, but that just adds to the whole experience. The food itself was good and came in large portion, so definitely worth coming back with friends who have never been. And despite its rather touristy status, the food was fairly priced - a main and half a pint was less than a tenner.",

I know it's an old building, but for me I still feel it lacks character.I've also always found it hard to find a place to sit. However I have only been with large groups and at night.This is a Sam Smith's pub so it's very cheap, but then I don't really like the taste of Sam Smith's products.Don't get me wrong, I think if I wanted to get drunk for cheap this might be the place to go, or maybe in the day it is quieter, but for me whilst I usually really like pubs with history, this just feels a bit gimmicky.I have not tried the food so cannot comment on this.",

Again, I'm not a \"pub\" kind of girl, so I probably didn't appreciate this as much as the next girl, but I was fascinated with the dark, almost \"shrunken\" decor! I mean i'm not what you would consider tall, but seriously you have to watch your head everywhere you go because the ceilings are so low and the hallways are so narrow!! We went all the way down to the basement. I had some sort of \"pot pie\" with meat and mushrooms. it came with fries and it was good. I'd suggest this place, if for no other reason, then the novelty of saying you went to the OLDEST pub in London!",

I like the sawdust spread over the floor.The pub is very old, and you get that impression from the coolness and calmess of the inside. It makes me feel like I'm curled up in a Dickens novel. This has the overall effect of giving the place a dim and sleepy feel, although it can get rather busy after 5pm.The smoking area is slightly removed from the entrance and doesn't really fit the feel of the venue, but it's still better than most 'stand on the street' options available at other pubs on Fleet Street.In general, as I've already mentioned..

This place still rocks. It doesn't try to sell you t-shirts despite being a historic and popular pub (can you tell I'm American?). Prices are more than reasonable since they serve Sam Smith's. Awesome photo ops for the ladies under the entryway to the formerly men's only bar right inside the entrance. If you're a lit fan, you'll have heard about Dickens referencing this place, and other legends slinking around. I am never sad to be here. Ever.

The only downside is the fact it closes early on the weekends. Aside from that, we had a great time exploring and taking in the history!",

In fact, I still do like the place, but the novelty has worn off slightly. It is still a nice place to come and drink, especially in the winter when coming in from the cold streets somehow accentuates the warmth and cosiness of the venue. I like the innovative solution they have found to serving food in a pub with so many hidey holes. They give you a beeper, so that you know when to come and pick up your meal. Of course everyone prefers their food brought to them, but that would be tricky here.So for drinks there is the usual cheap Sam Smith's selection, which I like as a change, but get a bit bored of if I visit their pubs too regularly. I don't go that often recently anyway...especially since I learned what jerks they are - oldham-chronicle.co.uk/n\u2026.The vaulted cellars may date back to the 13th Century, the rest of the pub was rebuilt after the great fire of London reduced it to fondue. It also has its fair share of famous patrons if you care to look it up.",

It is cool to eat in a table that you know could've been seating Charles Dickens back in the day. It is a little hidden and you must go behind an alley to find it. The food was okay, I think people are overrating the fish 'n chips because they honestly weren't that great. The chips are served warm and were the best part but the fish is scaley and don't even bother asking for tartar sauce. It came with no sauce and I see why. I ordered some tartar sauce to go with and it tasted like old mayonnaise so don't bother. They do have many different unique and organic drinks though which I heard they are pretty good. Don't bother ordering them if you aren't 18 though, this place is strict.",

    "text": "After reading about this pub in one of JK Rowling's books, i had really wanted to come check it out. The opportunity came when my friends from Toronto came to visit and we wanted to take them to a traditional English pub where people stand around and order drinks and food directly at the bar. This place was more than we bargained for. Not only are there more than rooms of bars, there are also two dining rooms so it got a bit confusing.As soon as you walk in, there's a small standing bar in one room, then a dining room on the other side. Keep walking past the stairs, another room with a big bar and plenty of seating. Down the stairs, there are two half levels with short cave-like ceilings for dining, and one more floor down is a giant room with a big bar and picnic tables. We did not venture to the upper floors.Food-wise, it was alright. My boyfriend had a steak and ale pie that was absolutely delicious, while my fish and chip was plain. No tartar sauce available so you gotta stick with the vinegar (or mustard if you like it that way). The Chicken pie was decent, but nothing mind-blowing.If you are just there to check out a really old pub in london where a lot of old famous Londoners used to hang, this is a great place for you to grab a pint - the only issue might be that every bar in this pub might have a slightly different selection of booze (they have a relatively wide selection).",

Old wood bar counters, alot of wood and bricks, low ceilings where at times it has a sign to watch your head, tiny clean toilets. Such a cozy place. Little coat racks around to hang your coat. Quite a few beers on tap and by the bottle. They seem to have some wine and a couple of hard liquors but not mixed cocktails. Some of the different bars served different drinks. We also ate here which was great for bar food. Got the fish and chips, the fish was tender, outside flaky & not too fishy. Plenty of fries and side of mashed peas. Really great prices all around.

First, they have a weird system where you order the food in the basement and when the buzzer buzzes, you have to carry it to your table, even if you're seated on the upper levels. Second, the food is just horrible. The fish and chips I ordered was sad. A big filet fried in thick tasteless batter. My wife's mushroom stroganoff was equally tasteless with nothing other than cream and lukewarm, dried up rice to go with. The food overall was almost cold by the time we got it. The beer is also a disappointment. The bartenders are quiet, don't really engage with you and you just don't feel like you're in a pub. Hardly any locals here either.

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I have to give Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese a 3 star rating. This pub has been one of my favourites in London for the last 2 years however until this week I had never eaten in their restaurant or spent longer than an hour or so in there - sadly this week I did just that and the service really let the pub down.We were seated in the restaurant and straight away the problems started. We had to ask to be given the menus, we had to ask to order drinks, we even had to ask to have our order taken (twice) and this continued throughout the evening with further drinks, desserts, the bill etc etc. I realise it was Christmas and they were busy but I do think that if we didn't continue to ask we would have been sat there for hours on end and never received anything.Now for the food. I was VERY excited to see that steak and kidney pudding was on the menu (it's the northern in me) but when I went to order it the waitress informed me that they'd run out. I really felt like we should have been notified of this before hand as we then had to take a further 5 minutes to decide what we wanted and amend our orders. So, I eventually opted for the roast beef. The beef was cooked well and the gravy flavoursome however there definitely wasn't enough of it and you had to order additional vegetables and gravy if needed (which we felt was needed). Overall it was a slightly disappointing evening but what I will say is that this hasn't put me off Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, it was just a bit of a let down. I will definitely head back when it's quieter and give the pudding a try.",

Every time I have a guest over from the other side of the pond, I conclude my Fleet Street tour with a sojourn up and down the many stairways and levels of this fabulous pub. The best part? It's older than at least a few dozen countries, mine being one of them!Walking into Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese feels like walking into a hobbit's house in the best possible sense. Turn down a Dickensian alleyway to enter the wooden panelled interior, with dim lighting and curved ceilings that make you feel as if it was carved into a hollowed-out tree. The tight entryways and cavernous bottom floor give this pub even more character. The good beer selection and its prized location means it's almost always packed. However, it is surprisingly expansive so you can usually find a place among its many drinking areas. \u00a0Absolutely a must visit for every true Londoner. I am definitely a devoted fan. The fact that it is literally a three minute walk from work (doesn't) helps!",

Less than a 10 min walk from the Blackfriars stop, located in an alleyway with a big round sign stating its presence. The top floor is for proper meals like steak and the such while the bottom two floors are designated more for drinking and bar food. We opted for the latter so we made our way down the creaky staircase into a room that looked like a wine cellar with little alcoves that held about 6 small tables in total which led to a bigger room with cafeteria style seating where the bar was located. Cool old pub vibe, it felt like I was being transported back in time. According to the hubby, the beer is on point and damn cheap at about \u00a32 a pint. Can't beat that in the U.S. even after the exchange rate. I tried the alpine lager and I usually can't handle much beer bc it makes me feel bloated but it was surprisingly refreshing and light. Food is ok, tried the chicken & mushroom pie and bangers and mash. Expect your typical bar food - decent/edible but by no means worth trekking out here for. Would definitely visit again for the beer and old school pub vibe if I had the chance",

We actually ate here twice on our 7 day stay in London. The Bangers and Mash with onion gravy is amazing. Great cider on tap too. You cant find cider like that in the states. The pub is a dark multi-level labrynth. The chop house in the ground floor. I never went to the upper levels, but down below are 3 split levels with more dining space and a bar in the cellar. The cool cellar was welcoming on a hot day in June (it was in the 90's Fahrenheit and humid when we were there!). The cellar had large bench tables perfect for bug groups. I also had their fish n chips, which was good, but the bangers are my go-to dish. Prices are reasonable. A pint is pretty cheap and dishes go for around 10\u00a3. The loo was surprisingly modern in this 400 year old pub. Charles Dickens was a regular here and has a favorite table in the chop house. A great way to experience a very traditional British pub.",

You walk in and its almost like a maze - it has small adjoining rooms where you can sit, eat or drink. Its really fun - but always watch your head! They had a good selection on draft and in bottles. Well rounded menu and kind staff. We got the fish & chips with mushy peas. Unfortunately it wasn't very good - probably a 2 star. I like my fish without skin on, this came with skin on, which caused the breading to not really attach. The chips were little cold/soggy and the mushy peas were so bland.

There are several floors but the basement is the neatest, as long as you're not claustrophobic. In the basement, you'll see pics of how the bar used to look back in the day which is pretty cool as you compare the area you're sitting in with the pic.I think it's super cool the notion that this has been around since the Great Fire and people still flock here after work to get a pint or two and try the meat pies. We are, after all, on Fleet Street (Yes, I really like Sweeney Todd). The food is actually pretty good (I LOVED the mushroom beef pie) and of course they have chips galore which goes splendidly with all the beer they have on tap.Be forewarned, the place is standing room and elbow room only. We happened to snag a table and some grateful locals shared it with us. Others, who were sitting or standing on steps that rainy day, weren't as fortunate.This pub is just NEATO and AWESOME AND AUTHENTIC, and why you go to London pubs in the first place.",

    "text": "Out on a Saturday evening's pub-skylarking with a friend we found ourselves in Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, and I have to say - I was very impressed! Initially the heat from the fireplace seemed oppressive, but that was possibly in contrast from the frigid chill we'd come in from. As our eyes adjusted to the stygian darkness of the front bar we managed to find a couple of chairs and thought \"Ah well, this is a tourist pub - we'll just grab one and then be on our way\". 2 hours later we were still there, having shifted to pints of ale with port chasers & chatting to a few punters who'd rocked up - we met a couple of lawyers from Lancashire, and a couple of tourists who had romanced across 4 continents. Maybe it was the fact that the pub - erected in 1667 - claims to have played host to a couple of hundred years' worth of literati, such as Dickens, Twain, Voltaire, and Dr Johnson, and so visitors entered eager for it to present a memorable trip and experience, rather than just another nice old building to stand in, look at, and walk out of again. As we sat, sipped & extemporised more than one new group of tourists ingressed - typically a shivering & slightly dejected looking gaggle led by an excited young man in front clutching a guidebook: and all of whom warmed up nicely, put away at least a swift half, before returning to the arctic Fleet-Streetian wastelands. I can't comment on the quality of food, as we only supped of the hop & vine. The pristineness of the toilets was remarkable - we suspected a recent renovation, but in contrast to the ancient smoke-stained walls upstairs, the loos were almost hospital-like! Having read other reviews here complaining about short pints & whatnot - the \"standard\" beers are dirt cheap (as Sam Smith's pubs always are), so getting 1/4 of an inch more head on your pint than you'd like isn't the end of the world... either let them know the tide's out, or quit whining. Realistically, the joy in this pub's in sitting back soaking up the atmosphere & ambience and enjoying a snug fireside chat - so get to it! It's a treasure. The only regret I've got is that the darkness in there was so impenetrable that I wasn't able to get a decent photo of the front room. And it had nothing to do with all the beer I'd drunk, honest.",

So the inside is dark and dingy, small rooms partitioned off, with steep creaky stairs leading to each floor. We sat upstairs on a table and I had a MASSIVE steak and kidney pudding with a pint of Bitter ('we only have the one, Sir') It was lovely but I wasn't hungry for two days afterwards!!

This was one of the places I came across and so a group of us decided to venture out and give it a try. It was a little bit hard to find but it is a little bit of a hidden gem. There are sort of two floor which sort of threw us off guard. There is a top floor which is a little more upscale. Then, you venture down several windey staircases into a lower basement which is a dim lit area. It gives off a very old school vibe and you definitely feel like you are in a pub many years ago. I ordered some sort of pie that had mushrooms in it along with a snakebite to drink. I know some of the people I was with ordered the fish & chips but I can't remember any of the other entrees. My pie was quite good and I remember my friend saying his fish and chips was good as well.This place has a very nice little ambiance to it. It is definitely not fancy by any means but if you are looking for a traditional pub this is an awesome place that really gives you that old school pub vibe with some great food and drink as well!!",

We drank and mused that it is particularly odd to be sat in a building that is older than every Western-influenced thing in your entire country. Strange.Ah, but this is a Sam Smith pub. We can pick up some of the Samuel Smith brews back here in Crapland, but they don't export their organic fruit beers. Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry Beer is my favourite beer of all time. Screw every other beer, this one tastes like cherry soda and I love it. Downstairs in the cellar was about the only place my very tall friend could sit without hitting his head (constant reminders to mind his head never help), but down there on a weeknight we got attentive bar service and were able to eat our fish and chip baskets in comfort.

The toilets are totally modern. Check out the writing in the old books on the way to the loos upstairs too. Can someone tell me what the double-decker tables are for? Empties? Candles? What?Oh, we had nibbles in here. The mushroom soup was very warming on a snowy winter afternoon and the fried cheese tasty.

It's a lovely pub while great little cubby holes and nooks and crannies (although does it have more nooks than it's sister pub The Princess Louise? Probably not). It's a Sam Smiths pub so you'd expect the rounds to be cheap, right? Nope. Not if you order anything other than the draught beer. I was feeling hungover so ordered a cheery beer and a soda water. The bill was \u00a35.10. EXCUSE ME? \u00a35.10?! Apparently charging \u00a31.20 for soda water is normal. Their tap water is free - so they've just charged me over a pound for bubbles. But they'd already poured it and I had to pay for it. Not impressed. \u00a34 for cherry beer means that it's not a cheap drink - you only get a bottle. My cheap (hungover) night out was somewhat marred by this. But dammit the cherry beer is really yummy. But if you're looking for a cheap night out, best stick to the draught beer. Had I done that, this place would have got five stars.",

Atmosphere was for sure \"old world\". You come into the main bar and if you want something to eat, you wind your way down stairs to the three rooms where they serve food. Ofcourse, no one from the establishment tells you this, you have to ask the patrons. They don't have wait staff, and don't bus tables. When we got there we found a table free so we waited for someone to come by a clean it. After ten minutes, I couldn't find anyone and a lady nearby told us to pile the dishes aside and order at the bar in the next floor down. We did, and got fish and chips and the meat pie. Both were really lacking in everything. I don't understand why in England the chips are not crisp, and the peas are mushy but, this was the same just about every single place we went to. I would say that if you want a pint and maybe a n appetizer in a really old pub, this is the one. If you want to go for a meal, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This pub oozes character. And I will admit, I had walked past the alley entranceway about 20 times before realizing (through Yelp) that it's actually a pub. Inside, the place is classic: wood everywhere, lots of different seating options, staircases, big rooms, little rooms, dining rooms. For ambience this place gets five stars, no question. On the night I visited (Friday, 8pm) the place was full but not crowded. There was only one bartender preparing drinks, though, and I think there should have been two. Not a huge deal, but we did have to wait about seven minutes for a beer. And as far as drink selection goes, this pub is about average. I do like Sam Smith, so as far as tied houses go, I would rank Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese above, say, a Youngs or a Fullers house. But compared against a free house with decent selection, Ye Olde earns runner-up status. Although, to Mr. Smith's credit, he does charge bargain prices for his pints; there's almost nowhere in this city where you can find a pint for \u00a31.99.So to sum, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is a good pub with that old-world, historical vibe. For the discerning beer drinker the beer selection is average, but for the average drinker (or tourist, or cost-conscious dude) the Sam Smith range will meet their needs. I would bring a guest here and will probably return at some point as the pub is about one block from my lady's place of work. Overall a nice pub that everyone in London should check out at least once.",

    "text": "My wife, who is Texan, was awed by the fact of it being rebuilt in 1667 just after the great fire. About 65 years before George Washington was a twinkle in his father's eye. The atmosphere was welcoming with friendly staff and happy diners. The menu was festooned with potentially repugnant old English delights for me along with the less adventurous traditional roast meats and puddings for my wife and our 9 year old daughter. We were a little concerned at first as the wine list consisted of Red or White but our fears were unfounded as the red turned out to be very good indeed. The food was good honest unpretentious English grub. My wife enjoying the roast beef, Yorkshire puddings with trimmings, which was well prepared and the meat nicely rare, My daughter had some of the best bangers and roast potatoes, they mercifully allow substitutions, I have ever tasted and I had the steak & kidney pudding although neither of them wanted to try mine for some unknown reason. My steak & kidney pud was indeed traditional. It had a mildly worrying ripe flavor and it contained more kidney than steak which was crowned with a thick stodgy suet crust (absolutely delicious). The presentation of the meals would have sent Gordon Ramsay into apoplexy but this went well with the surroundings & I don't think Charles Dickens would have complained. My bum started to hurt about thirty minutes into the meal as the benches are hardwood. However I think this may be a Dickensian way of getting the diners to finish their food quickly & move along. In the spirit of the place I endured this discomfort as I am sure these benches have been shined by more auspicious bums than my own. We went for a couple of the English puddings and tried the Welsh rarebit out of curiosity all of which were reminiscent of school dinners. The sticky toffee pudding was great but I would advise you to give the bread & butter pudding and anything with custard a miss as it was watery & tasteless. Good fun, interesting and cheap food, nice staff, bring a cushion.",

And the dark, heavy wood panels and tables take you back to a much browner period of history.The sausages are good, as is the rarebit.The beer is good, I thought a bit pricey, but that's to be expected from a pub right on the Strand.I love the historical info next to the stuffed parrot too. It was a pub pet famous for its proficiency in swearing, which, when it died, received obituaries in hundreds of papers worldwide. Utterly bizarre.",

That's right, as in, there was another pub here even before this one, a mere 343 years ago. Great atmosphere, reasonably priced Samuel Smith beers (amongst others) on tap, and they even serve bar food, which is of decent quality if you've had a few pints. Authentically charming, which is a rarity, I think.",

It's massive! Multiple different rooms and bars, a huge cellar bar, restaurants, saloon bar etc.The staff all seemed nice and being a Samuel Smith pub the drinks are very well priced too!A mate of mine recommended a new iPhone pub-finder app called \"Smith Finder\" bit.ly/TxB5ki that features this pub in it and loads more like it.

And it's the best bit of the day.Tucked away from Fleet Street, this not-so-secret secret is a real treat. A pub with huge character, the cosy interior, dim lighting and log fire set the mood for a long night of boozy story-telling and, if it takes your fancy, a game of hide and seek. Unless you're as mature as the Cheese and don't do childish games anymore.The downstairs area has its own bar and with a good selection of tipples as well as the usual bar snacks, you can easily wile away the hours without even realising where the time has gone.Time for another trip to the Cheese.

They have a not so subtle gift shop right by the front entrance. \u00a0But who cares? \u00a0After all, it is the oldest and possibly the most interesting pub in London and you just have to check it out (like Disneyland). Right outside the entrance is a sign chronicling its 400 years of history with the ruling kings. \u00a0(It puts the McDonald's \"billion served\" sign to shame.) It is rumored that Shakespeare hung out here. \u00a0To think all the drunks, scandals, and pub fights that occurred there over the hundreds of years, it's amazing that Ye Olde is still in business. \u00a0Beyond it's history, the pub also has an interesting floor plan. \u00a0It has multiple floors which are below ground. \u00a0(It must have been a conveniently cool place to hang during the air raids of WWII.) \u00a0each floor has tables and benches. \u00a0The pub also serves food but my local friends tell me it's expensive and not great. \u00a0Ye Olde also has its own beers too, but I wouldn't trek to Fleet Street just for their brew. \u00a0I would, however, go for the history and the ambiance. \u00a0Cheers!",

Truly an amazing place, located on London's famed Fleet Street, just a half mile from St. Paul's Cathedral. \u00a0Originally opened as a pub in 1538, it burned down in 1666 during the great fire of London, and then reopened in 1667, as it has since remained. \u00a0Where else can you sit among the ghosts of such notable regulars as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alfred Tennyson, \u00a0W. B. Yeats, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Johnson, Mark Twain and Charles Dickens, \u00a0to name just a few.The interior consists of a maze of different rooms, a chop house, numerous bars, \u00a0spiral staircases, narrow passageways, coal fireplaces and a variety of antique grandfather clocks throughout. \u00a0One of the most interesting rooms is the cellar, with its vaulted white ceilings \u00a0and white stone floors. \u00a0It is believed that this was originally a guest house belonging to a 13th century Carmelite Monastery which used to occupy this site. It is amazing how big this place is once inside, as it seems unassumingly small from the main entrance. \u00a0 \u00a0Part of the charm of the Cheshire is that it lacks natural lighting, giving it that gloomy aura of centuries past.The food and drink offered is better than average 'pub fare', \u00a0but the reason to visit is for the history and charm of the Cheshire. \u00a0It really is a mandatory stop for all who visit London. \u00a0Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese gets my patented 4 thumbs up!!!",

Upon entry, you are in a very small room; very low lighting and very rustic. \u00a0You can order here or go down the stairs where there are two more counters to order from in two separate rooms. \u00a0We ordered drinks first and then explored.The server in the first room was great. \u00a0 I wanted to try something new and local to England. \u00a0 He was very patient and explained and suggested something that was towards my taste. \u00a0Our next task was to find a place to sit. \u00a0The inside is arranged into small and medium rooms with tables for 2, 4, 6, or 8. The atmosphere is rustic and lots of stairs to get you to different levels. \u00a0I thought it was unique in how you could chose how private you want your setting.The beer was very good and produced by a local brewery. \u00a0They serve food but unfortunately, \u00a0I did not have time to order. \u00a0I loved the history and character of this pub and will definitely set a return trip when I find myself back in London.",

It's said that Charles Dickens wrote the Tale of Two cities here...It was the best of times....'it was the worst of times.'If you are a tall person, over 5'5\", you will bang your head on the low ceiling while negotiating the stairs.This is owned by the Samuel Smith brewing company, noteworthy for being one of the oldestbrewers in the UK from Yorkshire since 1758..As such you will find they have ample supplies of stouts and ales.This is where I discovered their Organic Chocolate Stout. If you like a Guinness you must try this beer. It can be found at most Total Wine stores.Very casual but you won't find a pool table or cell signal here and the menu is limited.",

    "text": "This is my absolute favourite pub in all of London. A treasured place since my 2006 study abroad, the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is sure to delight anyone or everyone with the historical atmosphere. If you come for a visit this is the first place I'll bring you. It's known as being a pub from the 1400's but it burnt down during the great fire of 1666, therefore it was rebuilt in 1667 and has been that way ever since. It boast that Mark Twain and Charles DIckens wrote here, enough for any writer to want to grab a seat to think where and what they penned over a pint of ale. It's got a great selection of beer and ales. The best part is that they are cheap with great quality. In celebration of completing my dissertation for my Master's, myself and a fellow colleague had dinner over our favourite pint Alpine. She had the soup of the day (mushroom and vegetable) while I had the three cheese mac and cheese. Although fairly priced, we both were hesitate about ordering the mac and cheese. She hails from the South and as American's we've taken notice to how different the English make our comfort foods over here. Before I ordered I asked the staff if they honestly would eat the mac and cheese with them reassuring me they usually pick what they would only eat themselves on the menu. (it is possible they just gave me a line but I appreciated the humor) We were able to sit in my favourite section, in between the lower dinning room and below basement banquet seating bar. With our buzzers waiting to vibrate letting us know our food was ready we enjoyed the slightly echoey cave like clean dungeon setting with original lighting that wasn't too dim nor very bright. (if you've been here you know what area I'm trying to describe)Upon first glance at the mac and cheese it appeared to be a kind of casserole rather than what I was expecting. Nevertheless it was absolutely fabulous! The cheeses were all melted together, pasta perfectly cooked, and icing on the mac was this mixture of bread crumbs, pepper and garlic toping. It was the perfect size complete with butter for the roll and a light salad with a pleasant dressing made it more filling than the under \u00a36 would have suggested. My friend's buzzer happened to be broken but the staff were able to bring her food out without letting it get cold due to the malfunction. It does get very busy in after work hours, but the beauty of this pub is that there are so many different places to sit and enjoy that it shouldn't be a problem. If you're tall you have to make sure to watch your head, it's over 400 hundred years old, before being able to accommodate everyone. It's a must visit pub whether you've lived all your life or are just passing through. It's also situated a couple of blocks above where The Black Friar is meaning it's a little out of the way to get too as Blackfriars station is closed for renovation. Enjoy it now before the Olympic rush will pack it to the point where you won't be able to breathe.",

    "text": "This justifies the 'Olde' in its name, as there has been a pub at this location since the 13th Century, although the present building dates from 1667. The date gives a clue why: the original was a victim of the Great Fire of London in 1666. Mark Twain and Dickens certainly drank here, and Samuel Johnson lived close by, so he probably did too. The building is a wonderful warren of small, wood-panelled interconnecting rooms, all on different levels. It's tourist heaven, but it gets a mixed clientele of lawyers and office workers as well. There are two bar areas, with the main entrance, on one of Fleet Street's little side lanes, adding to the sense of atmosphere. The pub is tied to Yorkshire brewery Sam Smiths, and when I went recently they only had Best Bitter on tap, though it seemed well kept.. It ought to get four or five stars. But they really need to train their staff better: I was served pints with the largest heads I've ever seen (over two inches). This was largely because the sparklers on the pump were too tight (even though Yorkshire beer is normally served through fairly tight sparklers). When a friend (who is a head brewer at a different brewery) pointed this out, the barmaid said, 'what's a sparkler?'. That said, the staff were very willing to top the pints up to a reasonable level, when asked, and were generally very friendly. But an unknowing tourist would have received two very short pints. Sorting this out would deliver four stars, which it really ought to be able to earn, on account of its history.",

Basically, it's amazing. Back to my earlier tangent, I can't tell you why or how granny could always make two syllables out of monosyllabic words like \"AuLD\" (or would it be \"Owl-ed\"?)

As I expect the others will yelp about their own experience I'll only write about my enjoyment. From the downstairs bar I ordered a Cola. It came from a unique brew bottle and it was rather delicious. There is nothing better than a nice soda brew.I had a rather large breakfast and so I was in no mood for too much for lunch. I ordered from the fried section the battered calamari. I have a slight tendency to order calamari when I can, I just love the stuff. I've had good, I've had bad. This was some of the best I've ever had. It tasted as if they had caught the squid within the last hour. Fresh, the perfect tenderness, with excellent flavour. Even the batter was delicious, light yet crisp.If I lived in London I would frequent the Cheshire Cheese just for the calamari.",

It's positively gloomy inside. \u00a0But, I say, the atmosphere is just perfect for some afternoon drinking on a miserable, rainy London day.",

You definitely want to see some history, you want to eat some fish n' chips and you want some good beers. Ye olde Cheshire has all of that, it's charming in a way that transports you to a different time. Once you walk in it's dimly lit along with candles on the table. The pub itself has portraits of old patrons and has shiny black painted walls. We were seated right away near the portrait of a patron that favored that particular part of the bar. Do go downstairs, it looks as if it used to be a speakeasy down there. The service is amazing, our waitress was sweet and informative. We ordered their organic line of fruit beers, the cherry was my favorite. Then we ordered the fish and chips, which came with mushy peas and scraps. She was nice enough to inform us that scraps are the pieces of the fish fry that fall off. Once eaten as a snack with salt & malted vinegar but was banned for being detrimental to ones health. Although the fish as so many have commented was under salted, we didn't mind adjusting it to our liking. Squeeze some lemon, add some salt and don't skimp on the malt vinegar. It was delicious, moderately priced and exactly what we wanted.",

I think more than anything, one would go for the experience and for the ambiance, knowing that this is a place that has catered to people for hundreds of years. This is kind of an amazing thing, if you really stop and think about it. However, the beers themselves weren't phenomenal (though traditional) and the food was just ok. It can get crowded (with tourists) so finding a spot to eat and drink might be difficult. I stood awkwardly along the edges until I sat down at a table and made friends with the people (tourists) already there. I would say: go for the historical aspect. Revel in the fact that you're in an establishment that far exceeds you and your existence.",

    "text": "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is one of London's most iconic pubs. This ancient establishment located on a tiny alley off of Fleet Street has played host to the famous, infamous, not-famous, and me! \u00a0 Samuel Johnson who lived around the corner was a frequent imbiber here as was Charles Dickens who lived a few streets to the north. Mark Twain stopped in when he was in London - you get the picture - it has many associations with more than a few literary greats. \u00a0Tourists do find this spot or perhaps I should say their tour guides find it for them but there is still room for Londoners and frequent travelers to London as well. If you want to eat in their restaurant room, think reservation only. \u00a0But don't despair if you have no reservation .... it's cooler to eat at the self-service downstairs. You order at the bar two levels beneath the ground level and you will be given a beeper that will flash red to pick up your food when it is ready. \u00a0The pub food can be very tasty and don't forget to help yourself to the condiments. \u00a0I had a very good steak and kidney pudding accompanied by veggies and potato slices. \u00a0Naturally you would expect some good beers to be on draught and they were - I especially like the house ale. My only recommendation is that bubble and squeak is on the restaurant menu but not the pub menu. Aww guys - put it on your pub menu as well.The prices are very fair and the staff are friendly. \u00a0Sir Arthur Conan Doyle devised some of his Sherlock Holmes mystery plots here. \u00a0After a few beers at the Olde Cheshire Cheese, you might just come up with their solutions!",

The building has multiple different room and the layout can be confusing to figure out where to go to get food.We ended up all the way downstairs in the cellar bar. The bartender was equity with all the history about one of London's oldest bars so you got a full show with your pint and bite.The meat pie that I had here was AMAZING and I believe this is a dish they change up. My plus 1 had the bangers and mash and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's pretty cool to sit in one of the favorite pubs of Charles Dickens. Perfect for lunch or stopping for a snack during your London pub crawl.",

Being 6'3 I find myself doing gymnastics just trying to get through the low hanging walls and small crevice-like doorways.This being said - my colleague Mark S. gave me a shout one afternoon after work and told me to come meet him at this 17th Century locale. It was a cool spot with mucho historical ambiance fuming from its walls. I became quite enamored when I discovered that it was a Samuel Smiths pub - - which immediatly drew praise and made the cheap pints flow much quicker. Cool place to hang out and enjoy a pint in the heart of St. Paul's. If you are into London historical locales - you have found the pub for you. If you are into having a cheeky pint with friends - you have for the pub for you. Go here and enjoy yourself, just please watch your head & step when moving about.",

There has been a pub on the location since 1538, being rebuilt after the Great Fire of London. Additionally it is mentioned in Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities'. The decor is as one would expect from somewhere with this heritage. There is lots of wood paneling, pokey little rooms, and a slightly dangerous stair case. My favourite place to sit is the lower most room which has its own bar and looks like a cellar. As a Sam Smith's bar the drinks selection is very good value if a little limited. The clientele is a mix of businessmen, tourists and students. The staff are personable and efficient.A good pub with lots of character and a wonderful sense of history. If you're a tourist visiting London I'd particularly recommend.",

My London college life mainly consisted of studying and drinking, so pub drinking inevitably formed a very VERY important part of my weekly (almost daily) agenda. Cheshire Cheese is absolutely charming and is conveniently located only a 5 minutes from my college library, so it was a regular meet up spot after lectures/classes. The atmosphere is adorable, and the vibe encapsulates London pub culture. Walking inside is like entering a wooden maze of low doorways and winding stairwells (definitely not a spot for the claustrophobic)....and nights are usually filled with local banker/lawyer types. The drinks are pretty standard (usually I just go for beer or cider) and according to my friends, the food is decent enough. Wanna re-live your Dickens/Sherlock Holmes fantasy? Come visit! And thank you Cheese, for all the memories and for providing me the warmth and solace of booze when I'm depressed from either the London gloominess or the fact that I have a 20 page essay due the next day.",

Mature, full of character and never lets you down.It provides full on good grub (Steak & Kidney pie is delish) and a pint (or three) of Sam Smiths will see you right. I had not been here for yonks and was not surprised to see that nothing, abso-bloody-lutely nothing had changed. Awwe Bless. It's like a home from home and you get the usual eclectic mix of locals and tourists wandering in. We always used to use the Cheese as our 'meet up' spot. Rule was ... 6PM in the Cellar bar on any given Thursday or Friday night whenever you happened to be in town and it is setup such that, even when the place is packed, you feel like you have your own 'ickle' private niche. We have had some brilliant pissupz in here, you just can't knock it for that 'Feels like a proper Pub' effect. I also think this particular boozer was formative in my fascination with ceilings. Take a look up whilst you're there ... see the charring on the Oak beams? Could that have been from the Great Fire of London 1666 ?.. take a look outside and see the sign that says \"rebuilt in 1667\" Nuff said. This place puts the 'Story' in historyAs a side note .. many moons ago I worked at the John Smiths brewery in Tadcaster and the story behind the two brothers, Sam & John is fascinating stuff. Go WIKI it and, if you get the chance ...go to Tadcaster and do the brewery trip. Trust me.",

It's old. Very old.. an ideal place to take Americans in London.The food isn't up to much. Cheap and fried for the main.

    "text": "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (what kind of name is this) was on our checklist of pubs to check out before leaving our four month stay in England, and we finally hit it up this week!It's cool to grab a pint in a place that predates the country you're from, I can only say I've done that a couple of times. This place is clearly covered in history and that is definitely part of its appeal. Its charm lies in a very worn, classic environment. The stairs are chewed away and the whole place is a little raggedy, but in the cool way. This is a great tourist location if you're trying to experience a classic London pub while you're here. Honestly, there are ironically very few like this still remaining in London. Everything is owned my Taylor Walker, Wetherspoons, or Sam Smiths it seems. This, however, is a thoroughbred original London pub and should be visited just for the novelty of its originality!!It's enormous once you get inside and there are many places to sit on its multiple levels. There are multiple bars too, so that's a great way to control traffic.Definitely visit Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese while rolling through, it is not an old cheese factory as you mistakenly may have thought. Also a quick tip, don't pronounce it \"YEE Olde...,\" pronounce it \"THE Olde....,\" something I picked up while in England.",

There has been a pub on this site since 1538, although the vaulted cellars may have belonged to a 13th-century Carmelite monastery. I would estimate that the shepherd's pie I had here certainly dated back a few centuries.... It's a wonderful place to go and have a drink - loads of small dark wooden panelled rooms on several different floors that seem to change location every time you turn around. I'd suggest dropping breadcrumbs when venturing to the loo, but the sawdust everywhere would mask them. My gripes are this: I was too cold in here (it was winter and we were in a room that did not have an open fire, as we wanted something more substantial to eat.) I was uncomfortable (they may look amazing, but 14th century wooden pews were not designed for bottom-luxury). The food was not brilliant (think school dinners). I would strongly suggest that if you have not been here before, then go and hang out where Dickens once drank, but don't eat here, and don't expect too much other than history, a sore bottom and a chilly draft.",

And the downstairs isn't a grimy dirty bar that you might expect. It had a great casual atmosphere and we had a great time without even buying alcohol!Fish and chips were pretty good. The pheasant was so so. Lemonades and dessert from the bar downstairs hit the spot. The building is pretty cool to check out. The first floor is pretty formal, but then super narrow spiral staircase brings you down to several table areas on different levels before you end up at the main open area. It's a little overpriced, but go for the experience (and then spend the rest of your trip eating somewhere else).",

Enter the Cheshire Cheese, just down the road, and a must do on my touristy list. Perfect.I love an old pub, and Cheshire Cheese is definitely that. Maybe the oldest in London, maybe not, but this place oozes history. And tourism, but as a tourist myself, I'll overlook that and just soak up the history. My sun-dazzled eyes couldn't take in most of the upper floor, as it was much darker inside than out, but in short order we were directed down the stairs and into the cellar area. As others have mentioned, watch the stairs and the ceiling. It's a miracle that my klutzy self didn't get a concussion or fall down the stairs! Ah, atmosphere. (Honestly, I did love it.)The cellar area is the very oldest part of the pub, so it was officially my favorite. Plus, it was nice and cool down there! We ordered a glass of wine, a beer, the Fisherman's pie (me) and the Cottage pie (my husband). The tables in that area are pretty much communal, so be prepared to share. The food came out relatively quickly, and while I'm somewhat suspicious that the mashed potatoes came out of a box, we were starving and the food filled the hole nicely. It wasn't gourmet by any stretch, but it was pretty solid pub food, and a good portion for the price, which is exactly what I expected.I probably wouldn't head back to the Cheshire Cheese for food, but would certainly come back for a drink and some more historical atmosphere if/when I'm in the area again.",

Once burned, shame on them; twice shame on me; I got tired of waiting,left and went to a more customer friendly pub that was open. Disappointing... they should post hours correctly and state whether or not, when they open, it is for bar drinks only.",

Add on the fact that it was only a 7 minute walk from the hotel equals myself trying the place. The entrance is sort of hidden off to the side, kind of giving it a mystery element. As you enter and walk downstairs, because the ceiling becomes super low, almost guaranteeing that you will bump your head. There is about 3 levels to this place and I'll say about 10 beers (including one organic one which was good by the way) on tap. For food I tried their wings with sweet chili sauce (only 4 pieces but was good) and the cottage pie (can't remember the difference, but is similar to Shepards pie and was actually good). Overall a good pub to come to while in London.",

It's set back from the main street and once inside, it's a maze of rooms and staircases, which gives it real charm. I had a burger and it was accompanied with a salad and chips and all were quite good - fresh and filling. And I had an organic wheat beer (can't recall the name) that helped to wash it down. The staff I encountered were friendly and it's a place you could easily just go grab a drink if you aren't in the mood for food or just pop in and visit the various alcoves below ground.",

There's been a pub in this location continuously since 1538 - although it had to be rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666. Don't miss out on this illustrious gem when you're wandering around the inner confines of the walled City. Frequented by Mark Twain and Tennyson amongst many other literary greats, referred to by Charles Dickens, Wodehouse and many others, the history here is quietly astounding. The ceilings are low, the air smells musty, the light is scarce. Nowadays on weekday afternoons you'll find somewhat smart-looking men with untucked shirts and guilty smiles knocking back a few beverages - trying to hide from the hamster wheel of corporate London. The fireplaces, mouldings and original fixtures are simply spectacular. Why only 4 stars? Samuel Smith Brewery owns the damn thing!!! No!!!! Most of the beers here are from the brewery and my insides just sag when I think of a lovely place like this being taken over by a large company. But such is life and change. What remains still charms.",

A pub has sat at this spot since the 16th century, and the current edition was built shortly after the fire of 1666. There are a number of older pubs in the same area, but ya know, this one is called \"Ye Olde\". It really is beautiful! And huge. Lots of floors and little rooms. When you first walk in there is just a tiny little room to the right which is PACKED. Keep walking, there are plenty of other seats to be found. We sat down in the lowest level, which was really quite beautiful. We had dinner and a few pints. They serve Sam Smith beers, so predictable offerings. The menu is confusing in that it just lists all their beers, and not the ones they currently have on tap. Clean bathrooms, and great ambiance. The food was lackluster, probably some of the worst I have had at a Pub in London, but I'd still go back for a few pints.",

Now I hit my head on the low beams and ceilings fairly regularly but even that hasn't tarnished my view of this place.

The original pub was built in the early 1500s and was rebuilt after the Great Fire in the mid 1600s. Very quaint, all dark wood, upstairs and downstairs. Duck your head when you head downstairs, there are signs, but I cant tell you how many times I have smacked my head, you would think you would learn. The downstairs part of the pub is cellar like and there are booths built into the rock. If you are planning on meeting people and are sat downstairs be wary that the signal is really poor. The food is standard pub fare, fish and chips, pies, scampi. However, I have never found it disappointing always flavorful and hot. It is a Sam Smiths pub so there is not a huge choice, but I dont mind Sam Smiths beers so its never been an issue. Very cool pub, that has a very Dickens feel with solid food and cold drinks.",

Not knowing what we should be looking for, we noticed the pub on the right side as one enters was full, so we went in the back and had a pie and a pint. On the way out, we discovered the room on the right (which was Dr. Johnson's room, and had a nice fire and available seating). Bottom line: Ask somebody about the rooms in this place when you enter. It's worth the visit, not so much for the food, but for the history and the atmosphere.",

And a place to bring visitors and impress them with lots of facts. I can't believe how good the prices are, too. An excellent City/Fleet St pub that should be better known. But I'd rather keep it to myself!",

    "text": "My one star is for everything bar the building itself. I would probably give the building four stars. But I wasn't there for the building.My gripe is this:There is only one ale on offer - Samuel Smith's Bitter. The only lager for sale is Samuel Smith's Lager (lager from Yorkshire?). If you want cider..you guessed it, Samuel Smith's cider.There is no Fosters, Stella, Carlsberg, Carling, Guinness, London Pride, in fact none of the familiar named ales or lagers or ciders, no guest ales, no Lambs, Captain Morgan, Bacardi, Teachers, Gordon's, Southern Comfort, none of the familiarly named spirits at all. It's so weird. They don't even sell Coke, or Sprite or any of those soft drinks we are familiar with. Everything is a cheap inferior substitute of the drink which you might have asked for in any normally run pub.I asked the girl behind the bar why, and she said it was to keep the prices down. Personally, I would be prepared to pay the extra and have my usual choice. Running a pub in this way is corporate suicide, surely.This is one of the oldest pubs in the country and a beautiful pub it is too, although extremely drab, and yet there is no choice for the drinker when they get inside. It may as well be a museum - after all it does feel like one.I came out of the Cheshire Cheese and crossed the road to Ye Olde Cock, where I was met with a selection of six different real ales and all the familiar stuff you would expect from an 'olde worlde' pub. The atmosphere was an improvement on the Cheshire Cheese simply because they seemed to care about their drinkers and what they want. Somebody had thought about the decor too. It was bright and welcoming and it felt good to be in there, which is everything the Cheshire Cheese wasn't.In summary, not a good place to go unless you're a teetotal historian interested in architecture. If you're in the area for the beer, try somewhere else.A bad experience.",
