    "text": "I love the Japanese style cabbage pancake mix that is Okonomiyaki and that Abeno do very well. The novelty of having something cooked in front of you and that you break off to eat on your plate is definitely worth visiting and experiencing at least once for yourself. They have plenty of different variations that is best thought of a very savoury pancake with different sets of meats and vegetables that is both fairly quick and easy to cook and eat. The best bit is when they ask if you want additional toppings, add the okonomiyaki sauce, japanese mayonnaise, and then the bonito flakes that literally dance from the heat on the grill. It's both amusing and slightly disturbing if it's the first time you've seen it and you have no idea what it is. I've been in summer before and if it gets too hot, they can cook it away from the table though I think that takes some of the experience away. Abeno also do a variety of other traditional dishes (I've had their noodle omelette) and they do them all very well if you don't feel like okonomiyaki.",

Abeno has a great selection of premium/organic ingredients more suited to the english market and their wide range of dishes are delicious and served fresh. Dinner is expensive, but it is one of the only places to enjoy this Japanese speciality and the staff and service is great.",

    "text": "japanese restaurant which specialises in okonomiyaki, which is like the japanase version of a pancake. Wikipedia has a page on okonomiyaki. They also do other foods, like Om-soba, tempura onigiri and so on. The food is ok, not like a culinary experience but very nice. It is probably on the side of more contemporary easy going japanese food, i was surprised for example that the okonomiyaki comes with sauces like ketchup, mayonnaise or barbecue sauce (japanese version). It is very convenient if you are at the British Museum, and one million time better than the cafes inside the museum. Apparently a booking is recommended: turning up at 18.00 on a saturday, we were given a table only for 1.5 hrs because it was otherwise fully booked. It's quite cheap and the food is nice, so it is definitely recommended; if you are visiting london it's nearby a major attraction so if you are into japanese food or would like to try, don't miss it. you will be sitting at a table with a grill in the middle (which is part of the table, so be careful) and they will cook the okonomiyaki in front of you. Service is, it goes without saying, of the highest quality in the typical japanese style.",

The only downside is the price - If they want to charge such high price, it should be twice as big. Location is really great for tourists heading to British Museum, it's just around the corner!",

Once you've chosen the combination of meat, fish and vegetables you want from the menu, the food is cooked in front of you on a hotplate on the table which is a fun extra touch and also ensures it is served to you piping hot. It tastes really good too, meaning Abeno is a welcome addition to the London dining scene.",

It serves okonomiyaki, a sort of omelette-slash-pancake affair that you can have customised with lots of toppings. They are very tasty and watching them cook them on a hotplate built into your table is fun. Quite expensive for what they are, though. But certainly worth trying; and if you do, try them in this branch.",

And a rather above average wine list as well with several really first class bottles. Lots of inexpensive nibbles and a good choice of the 'cabbage pankake' (Okonomi Yaki) and Om-Sorba -Noodles \u00a0all of really high quality and very flavoursome.Everything is very fresh and of highest quality. A bit smoky with the cooking right in front of you so don't go in your finest though the after-smell dissapears in a day. Really nice Japanese staff, though remember that their english may require you to speak carefully. Be sure to schedule more than one visit so you get used to the menu. Once you have found how it works, then you will have the nice feeling of a place that calls you to dine there regularly. Recent visit confirms still on song. Look also to second, slightly different version in Great Newport St. Still going strong at latest visit!",

You can top your pancake with an endless list of choices. \u00a0 It took us a while to decide what to order but finally selected. \u00a0I had prawns and squid and my husband chose the Kobe beef. \u00a0Both were cooked on a flat top in the middle of our table by our very experienced \u00a0waitress. \u00a0Each one was topped with two sauces, fish flake and dried seaweed flake. \u00a0It was one of the best things I've eaten in a very long time. \u00a0The service, food and overall experience was one of the food highlights of our London trip.",

It may not be flash or two-hat dining, but the food is almost impossible to beat.Fresh ingredients (you have to try the salmon sashimi) pierce your nostrils as you sit down. The staff come and cook many of the meals on hot plates which are in the middle of your table, facilitating a very friendly back-and-forth between diners and waitstaff. I phoned up and was told by one of the staff that the place was fully booked but that he would call me back if anything came free. 20 minutes later he called back and got me a table.If you like Japanese food--or if you just like really well-cooked fresh food--you need to come here. Just a stone's throw from West End theatres, the perfect way to end a night.",

The first thing I noticed about this place was the very authentic decor, and the beautiful Japanese paper on the menus - different on each one - is a lovely touch. But best of all are the 'Okonomi' pancakes which are cooked for you on a hot-plate at your table, as these are delicious and quite unlike anything I've had elsewhere. The desserts are also well worth a try, and they vary according to season. Make sure you pick one with the delicious macha green tea powder for a memorable finish to your meal!

The seating is unique - each little table has a heated panel in the centre of it upon which, after you've deliberated over the slightly bewildering array of options on offer - a member of staff will cook your omlette right under your nose! I must say, for this reason I would strongly advise that you think twice before going there on very hot days. However, with that caveat out of the way, Abeno is a great experience of a type of food you are unlikely to see in many places in London. While you're there try their sashimi beef and the \"Geisha\" cocktail. Verrrr niiice. hic",

Your meals definitely speaks for itself, and though vegetarians properly unearth their choice quite limited, it's a carnivore's bliss. Numerous business-types here on a week day lunch break, but the surroundings was still being fairly casual.Service was warm, attentive and thought to be without getting pushy or stuffy.

    "text": "Fact: Japan is my favorite travel destination. Fact: I love okonomiyakiFact: I love that I can get some made in London OK, so it's a little pricey for what it should be, but it's London and you saw what this city did to the burrito, right? You'll be central, you'll be paying for the table-entertainment of your server mixing, grilling, flipping and juuszing on your grill. I have to say, I really wish more places in London would embrace this style of table-cooking and service. It's a lot more social, ceremonial if you will, it makes eating a bit more interactive and the food becomes more of an occasion than just a function. The deluxe size was ok if you're not super hungry, you can top them with noodles or go larger. There's other sides and dishes of course but when in Abeno, do as the Osakans do. (order okonomiyaki).It's better than a couple of other ones I've had around town, give it a try!",

Okonomiyakis are cooked for you on your table, using that big heated surface in the middle. The staff will come with the different ingredients, mix them and cook in front of you. It's a great experience, and I'd recommend it if you like Japanese cuisine.There is a good number of choice on the menu, with different types of meat and whatnot. I went for an okonomiyaki with cheese and pork; which turned out to be particularly filling because of the cheese. But fear not, I am a small eater, so it is a good size portion. You can't really taste the cheese either, but you can tell it's there by the texture.Also, it's worth trying the Avocado & Tofu Gyoza. Not a common combination, but I found it delicious and surprising.",

    "text": "While in London, we went on an adventure to Abeno for lunch after I'd asked Alex S about okonomiyaki. He assured me this was the place to go, so off we went. Abeno is a smallish place, with nice Japanese decor (but not too over the top) and friendly staff. We were seated at a table for 4 but with the extra exciting addition of a grill right in the middle. We ordered some nigiri rice as well as our okonomiyaki, all opting to go for the London mix of bacon, cheese, pork and salmon. Weird combination, I know. The okonomiyaki is cooked right in front of you on the grill by the chef. It is really awesome to watch and adds a real element of fun to your meal. After checking the Abeno website, I see there are 7 steps to okonomiyaki enlightenment, which I will share with you: 1. The arrival. A trolley with the ingredients arrives for you to gaze at. 2. The mixing. The chef will mix together the batter right there are the table in a mesmerizing fashion. 3. The pouring. The batter is poured onto a very lightly oiled grill. 4. The shaping. It is pushed into a nice round shape. 5. The cooking. Well, that's kind of happening from stage 3 to be honest, but you get to hear the satisfying sizzle of the batter cooking away. 6. The flipping. Right before it's flipped, the bacon is added so that it is nicely cooked when it it flipped over. 7. The decoration. Once the okonomiyaki is done, it is decorated with Kewpie mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce (a little bit like a BBQ sauce). So, what was the taste verdict? Exceptional, it was absolutely perfect and I loved every bite of it. The strange combination of ingredients worked, and it was really a lovely lunch. We unfortunately had to dash off but the staff packed up our partly eaten okonomiyaki into boxes for us to finish later on that day. I'm glad to say even a few hours later it was still just as tasty.

Our server came out with a bowl of ingredients, whisked them all together, and poured it onto the stove-table in front of us. Took about 10 minutes to cook and then added a number of mysterious sauces and flakes (two of which seemed to be a Japanese mayonnaise and seaweed flakes. In the end, it was yummy and so I ate it.

Wagamama is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but it's not TRUE Japanese food, is it? More so commercialized goodness for a bunch of white people. It's not that it's bad, it's just a bit blaaaah. Secondly, thank you for fulfilling a dream of mine and finally having okonomiyaki. And by God, it was delicious. The wait was horrendous for our party of four, but hey, we are newbies. I'll remember to make a reservation next time: PINKY SWEAR. Thank you kind hostess chick for making the googly-eyes with one friend and getting us a table. You're the bestest! The okonomiyaki was divine. You prepared it, fresh, in front of me, much to my delight. I almost spilled my ginger hot toddy, I was so giddy! Fresh eggs, mushrooms, veggies, quail eggs, and various spices/herbs/oils I can't even begin to remember. I do remember the Japanese mayo though. That was just WEIRD. No, Japan. Just ... no. Great experience. I added it to my \"places that are bad ass and must frequent again\" list. Because, you know, you rock. Although I am tempted to try the dim sum which is super close by as well .... decisions!!",

I've been wanting to try it for ages but for some reason just never got around to getting to a Japanese restaurant that served it, but tonight was the night.The process is mesmerizing. The waiter comes to your table with a bowl full of the ingredients - egg, cabbage, 'tempura batter' and fillings, mixes them right up and pours it slowly on the grill built into your table, forming a nice little circle. As the first side fries up, he starts to cook the pork and lays it neatly on top of the batter mixture covering the surface. He places a lid on it and leaves it to cook. Then after a few flips here and there, he brings out an array of sauces and toppings to adorn the pancake in more deliciousness. We had the Inaka mix of pork, corn and Konnyaku, which is a mixture of yam and seaweed. Delicious! We also had the Om-soba with chicken, which is basically fried noodles wrapped in an omelette - a great choice, and then topped the meal off with a refreshing mango sorbet. I'll be back!",

I said it. Everyone who wrote a review seems to think okonomiyaki is the best thing ever, but really I just thought it was a giant ball of stir fry. I mean, yes, in essence okonomiyaki is just that, right? They mix all of your ingredients in a bowl and fry it all in front of you. Lots of oil to grease up the grill as it doesn't all cook in one go; they cook some of the mix, then cover it, then fry it a few times more while adding a little bit more ingredients every time. I decided to forfeit an extra 4 pounds to add noodles too as I wasn't sure if it would be filling enough..It was definitely more than filling! But I think it was all the oil and it tasted like most of my stir fry asian food but put together more uniquely. Granted, I chose a pretty standard order with pretty standard Asian ingredients you'd find in stir fry. It was their special dish for the day which had some organic pork (emphasis on organic, my guess is that's why it was the special), quail egg, some onions, cabbage, carrots, dough, etc. The waitress recommended that I try an okonomiyaki with cheese and I played it safe and ordered the mediocre! I just thought there'd be too much Western fusion by getting a cheese dish, but I know better now. So, I'm not going to give the place 3 stars just cause I made a poor choice, my tip is to try something more unique and go for the crazy mixes. Other than my okonomiyaki choice though, I thought the service was quite lovely. The kind waitress explained to me exactly what she was doing as she made me my dish and I thought that was really nice of her. She also gave me good recommendations, if only I had listened :) I think I'll also ask if I can try frying the batter myself next time as it looks really fun to cook and I can portion my sizes better without it being a giant greasy pancake the size of my head.",

It was delicious, but the portion sizes are also a little small. Luckily we had ordered the delicious pork appetizer (Buta Shoga-Yaki)We got the Shinshu and the Tokyo mix okonomiyaki - both were good and I was surprised to find that cheese does work with okonomiyaki. Be sure to get extra mayo and okonomiyaki sauce; it's delicious! Yes I would come back but again most repeat that portion sizes are small and this place can get a little pricey.",

I'm giving it 4 stars is because the air circulation inside the restaurant is really bad. All the stinky greasy smell stuck on our clothes....",

We waited there for 35 minutes until we got our ONE okonomiyaki. Now if it was a good okonomiyaki, maybe I'd give it some slack but really there was nothing special about it. They were frugal about the toppings, it was soggy and there were barely and pieces of pork belly in it. Okonomiyaki is one of the easiest things to make and somehow they've managed to make it average. Oh and they charged an outrageous amount for one tiny little piece - about the size of my hand.",

    "text": "Uh oooh... another new food love. I feel I need to start frequenting oxygen bars instead of restaurants... They would be so much better for the waistline. Okonomo-yaki.A kind of Japanese pancake. Of sorts. Made out batter, cabbage and onions as a base, with fillings of your choice added. I got a 'London special' (when in Rome, ye know!) with salmon, bacon, pork (mixed into the batter), and cheese. There's a hot plate in the middle of the table (I guess they get made by the same dude who makes the Korean BBQ tables!) and a staff member comes over and makes the pancakes right there in front of you. There's a bit of ceremony to it so it's a seriously fun way of eating lunch.You get a &*$%load of sauces then to go on top - chili, Japanese mayo, shredded seaweed etc. All artfully placed by your star waiter. To wash down all that savoury goodness, I got an apricot juice. An. Apricot. Juice. A juice. Made out of apricots! Ok not quite. I just wanted to get you excited. It was some type soda water with an apricot down at the bottom which had completely flavoured the drink. There may have been some sugar added too as it was pretty sweet, but goddamit, it was so refreshing I did not want it to end. The pancakes come in two sizes - delux and super delux. I was absolutely stuffed to the brim after the delux, so the super is probably for the hardcore amongst us. Or those who want to eat it again later on (which I so would!) As far as I'm aware, you need to make reservations for this one, although it was relatively quiet when I was there. So there you have it. Another five star review. Sure where would ye get it!",

On one hand I like that they cook the okonomiyaki in front of you. It's certainly a plus if you're introducing people to okonomiyaki. I also thought the okonomiyaki itself was pretty good. However, okonomiyaki is street food in Japan. And \u00a313 for a lunch special? I had to deduct a star for that. Especially because the okonomiyaki didn't exactly blow my mind. I even tried their London style okonomiyaki. I might be a little spoiled since I do get very good okonomiyaki for cheap back in NY but I was speaking with another friend who has lived in London and he is in agreement. So in conclusion I can only rate Abeno 3 stars.",

The side dish they had was gyoza with avocado and tofu filling. It's my first time having avocado gyoza and I'm not sure if I liked that taste... It seems a very odd combination to meNow for the main course of the meal: okonomiyaki. The server brings the mix to your table and makes it on the grill in front of you. It's pbbly a fun thing to watch for most ppl but I've seen it quite a few times before and made okonomiyaki on my own as well. The portion was smaller than expected but oh well it's london. The okonomiyaki tasted pretty good (okonomiyaki sauce and japanese mayo combined makes everything tastes good), quite authentic. I do wish there could be a little more shrimp in it.",

So I suppose the criteria was met.If you do not know what they serve here, the best way I can describe the Okonomiyaki style dinner is like a custom-made omelette/pancake with any of the ingredients that you should wish to include.Best of all, it is cooked at your table! It certainly adds to the entertainment. However, if like me you are perpetually hungry, the tantalising smells and sites that emanate from in front of you while you are required to summon all of your internal patients to hold on for just a few minutes more for it to cook - agonising!Once it is cooked, they provide it with your option of sauce or not. I went with the sauce. It was tremendous.So all in all a great experience in this small but refined restaurant. Make sure you put aside the time to dine here, it is definitely not a grab and go type place. It was not too expensive either, fairly reasonable.If you want something different. While you are out and about in this part of town, go kit check it out. I'm sure you will not be disappointed.",

Unique, unequivocally delicious, full of flavour, creative ingredients and so much fun to watch being made right at your table. If you have never had Okonomiyaki, basically, well, um... ok, it's kind of like a big Japanese omelet that is fried up on a grill at your table. You can choose from a load of different options - I had the London which has pork, bacon, cheese and salmon in it (I added corn 'cuz I loooove sweet corn!) Hubby had the Tokyo with squid and prawns in it. Then they bring your ingredients to the table in a bowl, crack and egg in it, whip it up and then start to fry it on the table... it takes about 15 minutes to cook, then when it is done, a sweet bbq(ish) sauce along with a Japanese mayo is swirled on, topped with seaweed powder and those fish flakes that come alive when sprinkled on anything hot. Viola! And the best part, you eat it right off the hot grill, so every bite to the very end it hot, crispy and as delicious as the first bit. I can't wait to go back again.

Those who have been to Japan will recognise that it's a very common street food there...but here in London it's kind of a real delicacy!Why is it such an experience? -Well, because of the way your food is being prepared...right in front of you. The waiter brings all the pancake ingredients to the table and then mixes them together and spreads them out on the table grill...and at that point you cannot stop but salivating excessively. Once the pancakes are done, they are being decorated with Japanese Mayonnaise and other treats such as tuna flakes and seaweed-sprinkles...yummy!A few tips: first, if you want to go on the weekend, make sure you have a reservation as they are very busy; second, this is not fast food, and the whole dinner might go well beyond the 2hrs mark; third, if you plan on going here before going clubbing or so - don't! Because you might not be the most-attractive smelling person once you leave the restaurant!Guten Appetit!",

    "text": "Abeno's concept is okonomiyaki made in front of you. Not all that impressive but the food was really decent.My friend and I came mid-afternoon on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty packed. Luckily we didn't have to wait. The menu features a variety of okonomiyaki that come in a deluxe size (recommended 1-2 people) and a super deluxe size (recommended 3-4 people). The base is all the same (batter, cabbage, spring onions, egg, etc) and you choose your toppings.We decided to share the agedashi tofu and the Tokyo Mix okonomiyaki, which comes with prawn, squid and pork as the toppings in the deluxe size. The agedashi tofu was on point but nothing mind blowing. The ingredients for the okonomiyaki were then brought to our table and cooked on the stove in front of us. The cooking wasn't that impressive and was a little awkward to be honest but the okonomiyaki tasted pretty good. The batter was flavorful and tasted pretty authentic. I thought the squid was going to be chewy but it turned out really tender and the prawns were big and tasted fresh too.Overall, I didn't care much for the cooking but the food was really decent. The waiters are really patient and helpful too. I'd come back if I was craving Okonomiyaki again.",

Amazing okonomiyaki, very good sashimi (first time trying it, but I've been told it's pretty good from a knowledgeable friend). They make the okonomiyaki next to you so no stress involved and you can see that they're honest. Service is also happy to give recommendations. Just be careful with the big option. I ate sashimi and 80% of the big okonomiyaki. Was heartbroken to leave some behind.Tried to go there for an occasion and couldn't book a table for two (on a Tuesday) with 3 days heads up. Book early.",

This place is delicious, has a large variety of dishes, and it doesn't get much fresher than this, because they make the okonomiyaki in front of you on the grill.Come with a party of 2-4 (but not more, because the tables are not very large). If you come for lunch, ask for the lunch menu. I was a little annoyed because I wasn't given one, and then charged the a la carte prices, when I had really ordered almost exactly what was on the (cheaper) lunch menu.Agedashi-dofu - Freshly deep-fried, without excess batter on the tofu, this was exactly how agedashi-dofu should be like. Decent portion size and easily sharable with 2-3 people. I think there were 4-5 pieces total.Tokyo Mix (Deluxe Size \u00a312.95; Deluxe Super \u00a314.95) - Pork, Squid & Prawn - I liked this combo of flavors - not too many things mixed together so that you couldn't enjoy the individual flavors. There was squid and prawn mixed into the batter, and cooked right in front of us at the table/on the grill, and then strips of bacon are layered on top. We also got the noodles on top because we're fatties like that, and it was so delicious, especially since it got crispy on the grill. The deluxe super is more than enough for 2 people and would probably feed 3 (but the 2 of us ate the whole thing)So many different combinations of flavors to choose from, and super authentic and fresh. I'd definitely come back here on another trip to London. If you like Japanese food, don't miss this place!",

I have had this more then once in Japan and I can tell you it's just as good here in London as it is in the land of the rising sun, The only difference being someone cooks it for you rather then you cook it your self as you do in Japan. As always the Japanese staff fall over them selfs to make you feel welcome and comfortable, Customer service is brilliant... The food is super fresh and very tasty and to top it off it's a very good experience and would go down well if on a first date or just taking the other half out for some browny points :-) Can be a littlePricey but eating in London generally is, don't let this place pass you by.",
