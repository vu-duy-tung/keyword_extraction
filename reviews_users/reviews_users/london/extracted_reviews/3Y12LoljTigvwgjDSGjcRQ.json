    "text": "Wowee this place is good. We were warned to expect good things. So keen were we to eat here, we shunned the many other fine establishments to trek here after the pub on a Friday night. The staff were lovely enough to stay open just a little later than they would have liked to accommodate a big group of us.The starters were mostly just ok - typical thai fried efforts, but on the tastier side of those I've had before. Should have had the soup. But the mains were fantastic. Can highly recommend the duck with shallots - so very different to what I've had before but unmistakeably thai. Fresh, tasty and fragrant. YUM. And yes, the rumours are true, the coconut rice is amazing. A meal in its own right. From the slurps of delight all around, I can confidently say that Rabeing serves up some delicious fare. The surrounds are pleasant enough. Nothing too ornate - especiallly the slightly dingy toilets downstairs. But that shouldn't put you off, hell no. Not as charming as Isarn down the road, but ideal for a group dinner.",

Skip all the other nearby spots, this was without a doubt the best Thai in the area.It was an eat-in night, a night where I couldn't be bothered to put on a face... or trousers for that matter. So take-away it was! I called in a basic order of coconut rice, tom yum soup, green gurry and sweet & sour chicken, and not only was it ready for me in 15 minutes, but each dish had lovely, vibrant and remarkably different flavours. (You wouldn't believe the places I've gone where every dish manages to taste the same!) This was certainly some of the most flavourful tom yum I've ever had, the beautiful green curry had huge slices of chicken breast with quite a nice kick, and the sweet and sour chicken had just the right consistency of sauce with large grilled pineapple. The highlight? The coconut rice. It was perfection. Oh, and they slipped some complimentary prawn crackers in my take away bag. It was a crunchy treat while I waited for my fresh food to cool. \u00a0It's open late, the staff is super friendly, plus you can take 10% off your bill if you're willing to pick it up yourself! Do it. Do it now.",

It's a bit more cosy and dimly lit \u00a0these days, none of that harsh fluoro lighting and bare walls. Service was friendly enough. Had the fish cakes, prawn rolls, jungle curry and pad kee mow (speling?) - all pretty spicy and not bad flavours...but I've definitely had better...like down the road, literally! i won't name names but there's a fab thai place on the exact same street towards angel for about the same prices with lovely service too. On balance, i'd have to pick the other one. But if you live next door to here, this is completely acceptable. You can never go too wrong with Thai food.",

    "text": "Two stars. Mainly two, simply because the waitress was extremely polite and accommodating, with the supplementary gesture of refilling water which not many do these days. Honestly, the food was sad. Truly, truly sad. From appetizers, to main courses. This was a Sunday afternoon. It should be one of the peak points of the food industry to gauge when traffic will be at a high and therefore make sure you can attract repeat customers, let alone satisfied ones...anyway let me expand. Vegetable spring rolls- Honestly, the flavor was dismal, and I know where it's from. These are store bought spring rolls, and sadly even worse than that is that they are smaller than your average chapstick. So flavor is off. Quantity is disappointing. Massaman curry- Given that this is a key seller for almost any thai restaurant, you'd be remiss to fail at this hurdle. Before spooning out the chicken it had a slightly reddish tint that made me worry it was undercooked...and that would have been better than the reality. The hue was purely from the fact that the meat had been sitting there and probably heated and reheated in a bulk microwave round that charred and turned the meat crispy. How is chicken in a stew crispy when it isn't cooked separately??? \u00a0Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles)- Truly. How is baby corn in a flash fried wok dish limp and soaked to the point that it is wilting from over-saturation of oil...or water in an even more daunting scenario. The overpowering flavor of basil in this instance was the saving grace that kept you unaware of the sub par level of this dish. Beyond which the beef that accompanied it was sauteed briefly just as well to accommodate the palette of anyone that had a confused look on their Chevy Chase. Rice- \u00a0The best part of the meal. Was cooked not that long before ingesting. Would like to give it a second chance, but to be fair, why? People may rate this place, and you could say that it was an off day...but for all the misses...I don't know.",

The pad thai and green curry we ordered were both tasty. Nothing was the best Thai I've had in Thailand or Toronto but it was authentic. Not a Chinese style restaurant.

It turned out that they were only happy to honour this for one person per table (which seemed like kind of a weird approach, given that tables could be any size, and the more of us there, the more we're spending - plus of course this isn't clear in the offer itself - suspect it was just the case in the moment). I had crispy squid starter, which was delicious and succulent and not a bad size. I then had Tom Kha with prawns, which is a coconut soup. It was very tasty - BUT it was laughably small, which would be ok I suppose if it was a cheap starter, but it was about \u00a37, so more like \u00a310 with rice - not cool. My boyfriend's prawn dish (can't remember what it was) was greatly enjoyed by him but also a bit overpriced at \u00a314 excluding any sides. Food and other service came quite slowly and we had to ask twice for tap water. There was then some palaver with the bill, as my boyfriend and I paid together, then our friend tried to pay for her (cheaper) meal by card and found out it was a \u00a310 minimum, so asked to pay \u00a310 on card and get change, which was totally misconstrued by the staff...it eventually worked out, but there definitely wasn't a friendly, conciliatory vibe from the staff - think the 12.5% service charge was pushing it a lot.",

Everywhere is heaving but we manage to get a table on Rabieng.It looks nice and smells delicious as we head in, so that's a good sign.We're seated in the back section of the restaurant which is a shame as it's empty and all the other diners and atmosphere are at the front of the restaurant. Awkward.Anyway, we order the mixed starter platter, everything is yummy and we have various (complimentary) prawn crackers to eat whilst we wait.It's a Thai place but it also has some Malaysian dishes on the menu. I opted for beef rendang and the boy ordered weeping tiger steak. My dish was delicious - piles of slow cooked flavours one beef in a tasty sauce. It was enough meat for two but I polished it off.I ordered sticky rice and really didn't like it - it wasn't like the sticky rice I ate in Thailand.My boyfriends dish was okay. The steak was really tasty and it came with a tamarind dip, but it was accompanied by baby vegetables which I didn't think was very authentic, and made for quite a dry dish with rice.We washed our meals down with decently priced cocktails and left stuffed.Sadly upon leaving I remembered to check in only to find id missed out on redeeming a free glass of wine offer, damn it! Lesson learned... Always check in on arrival.Upon paying the bill we were given a \u00a35 off a \u00a350 spend voucher for next time.It was a little pricey for Thai food, so you'd easily spend \u00a350. Our mixed starter, two mains, rice and two cocktails cost us roughly \u00a365. I enjoyed it but I don't think id head back any time soon. Thai food at it's best has always been in a street market for me and mega cheap.",

Servers are not the nicest, but they are efficient and get the job done.Pad Kra Prow (basil) - only veggies, no tofu, so there was a great variety. Broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, onions, cauliflower, string beans, cabbage. Stir-fried basil is already a spicy dish (two chilis), but I asked for it extra spicy and they actually accommodated it. So many places will not make it spicy even though I make clear I want it spicier! It's like they don't believe me or think they know what I want better that I do. They don't. And this place actually listened. Sauce was great, spices were right, no complaints.Pad Med Mamuang (cashew) - also got all veggies. This sauce was blander and sweeter, so we mixed it with the basil sauce. It's not too flavorful and it's mild, so I wouldn't particularly recommend it or I might suggest adding some heat to bring out more of its flavor. Good amount of cashews, though.Rice portions are small, so we ended up ordering 3 for two of us, which added greatly to the total of the bill. It was nearly as much as the main entrees.Thai iced tea was good.I'd recommend this place and would be back if I were in the area.",

    "text": "Rabieng definitely satisfies that Thai craving when it hits you, it may not change your life, but it deserves a spot in your rotation, or at least a visit if you're in the neighborhood.The Vibe:A little classier than most Thai places, but all in all, pretty typical settings. Service was incredibly friendly, and reasonably attentive. The Food:Solid food with quality ingredients and attention to detail. We ordered pretty standard fare, the Pad Thai and the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao), and both were great. Each ingredient in the dishes was seasoned, cooked well, and thought through. It lacked that special something to really stand out, but it definitely hit the spot. Yelp check in got us each a glass of the house wine, which was a nice plus, but they weren't anything I would drink if it wasn't free. Try the chili sauce on the table, it's got good body and I think it's house made.",

My spice craving got the better of me and I asked them to make a chicken chilli (same recipe as seafood chilli) and to throw in some extra green peppercorns. \u00a0It was executed to perfection - the heat was there but did not tear into the palette like a hungry barbarian. Instead it gently lilted in almost in harmony with the music and built up to a crescendo before disappearing to leave a clean finish.",

Don't remember having this good food in ages. The place is very cozy, very tasteful decor with a bit of antique feel in it. Just lovely place for couples to sit by the windows. The last star was not earned due to place being a bit expensive: rice 3 GBP extra for a small pot? Try halving the price and we're talking matching quality and price ratio. Otherwise perfect.",

The smell of the place was making my mouth water.I'll have to come back, not sure if my dish was so excellent cause I was starving, it was just dam good.

Don't get me wrong, they're not that small but the food surely is not filling and you have to order a lot if you want to fill up. However, the guys compensate with some quite delicious food and lovely attitude. There was a thing that to me personally was more than brilliant - they replaced my order in just a couple of minutes when I told them it was mixed up. I even received complimentary chili sauce when they admitted to the mistake.The prawns and curries are awesome and can make up for an excellent last minute dinner option.",

The rice is always properly cooked and aromatic. The \"drunken noodles\" are some of the best I've ever had (and I've had many). I could go on and on about how delicious the food is at Rabieng! The service is always stellar, too. I'm well into Thai food, and I just keep going back for more even though there are so many places I haven't tried yet.I highly recommend the Tom Ka soup, Drunken Noodles (or Pad Thai if you don't do spicy- theirs is phenomenal), and Chicken Satay as gateway dishes for those new to Thai food. There's something for everyone, even picky eaters and vegetarians! I haven't been in on a busy weekend evening, so I don't know how they do when they're hopping, but when I want a tasty meal mid-week, I head on over.Admittedly, the atmosphere is a bit OTT, but it's rather cosy in the evening when the candles are all lit and the lights are dimmed. It could do with a little redecorating, but so long as the food stays good, I'm there.",

I also ordered a \u00a0Chicken Pad Thai which had, egg, beansprouts, spring onion and grounded peanuts. This meal was truly delicious, but I wish the portion size was bigger, I mean all that singing starved me out, and needed more food, but hey it was standard portion, I'am just being a pig.The staff was pleasant. The price's reasonble.On their home deliveries, they do a lot of special offers. They also do a set lunch/evening meals.Very rare for me to be in this side of town, but if I'am here again I shall pop in.",

We went there for lunch over the Easter weekend - and despite us being the first and only customers there for the duration of the meal, our food took forever to arrive. On the good points - the Thai ice tea was pretty good. I have no idea what went into it, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but it was something unique and interesting. Foodwise - I was disappointed by the spicyness levels. Even the dishes on the menu with 3 chillies (most hot) was very mild. The dishes were OK - not the best I've had, but by no means the worst I've had either. The rice was a bit of a disappointment though. For Thai food, one expects to have soft, but dry rice - in order to soak up the curries and sauces. We were given extremely sticky and wet rice - a bit more and it would be congee. Pricewise - standard. Surprisingly not too expensive given its Upper Street location. The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",
