Case in point, my boyfriend who took a lot of convincing to eat sunday breakfast there is most definitely a meat and potatoes type of guy and he walked away full and satisfied. In the 2.5 years we've been together I have never seen him eat a raw tomato except here. What a feat! Delicious looking treats including muffins and scones. I didn't try them but next time I will. I have tried the porridge, which seemed like the never ending bowl. I barely made a dent in it. It could easily feed 2 people, and it comes with all the fix-ins. The Cheesy bread with bacon was delicious. Not too heavy and the bacon cooked to perfection. The Avo and tomato salad with bacon again, was unforgettable. Really tasty meals here. Go for breakfast, stay for lunch and find yourself wandering there for dinner.",

My hotel happened to be right round the corner from this cafe so yelp told me, and the reviews encouraged me to head on round. When I got in I instantly liked the place. It has the contemporary chalk on the walls and rustic wooden furniture thing going on, and the food they offer looked absolutely amazing. Ill definitely be going back to try the food out, but yesterday all I wanted was something healthy that would wake me up. I can't remember the exact ingredients of my smoothie, but I'm positive it was blackcurrant, raspberry and ginger. Regardless of what was in it fruit wise, it was deliciously fruity and the ginger gave it a strange but pleasant kick. The staff were chatting away to a couple of regulars, which made me like the place more. Rapport with customers is always a great thing to see. Highly recommended place!",

I would generally forgive the grumpy staff shuffling around from table to table (it's busy, it's early, I get it) because the food is still pretty decent, but not this time. We arrived and luckily found a table immediately, must've been in between rushes. Ordered 2 coffees and 2 meals. Our coffees came out within 5/10 minutes as usual, no problem. But then we noticed that our food was taking a while. People who arrived about 15 minutes after us were served their food first. So after about 30/40 min, I went up to the counter and inquired about our meals. The response was, \"Oh ok, I'll check in the back.\" Great. 15 minutes later, and still nothing. So I went up a second time and asked again. She said she'd check again. A few minutes later our food appeared - the waitress was curt and not apologetic at all that we waited nearly an hour for our meal.I understand it's busy and that these things happen, but would've expected a more prompt response and better service once we complained. I doubt I'll be returning here. There are better places for brunch.",

    "text": "Probably one of my best meals thus far in London. A group of 6 of us came here seeking brunch food (eggs, french toast, etc.) at 1PM. The place was packed, and we had a 20 min wait ahead of us. The woman at the counter suggested we place our orders ahead of time so that our food would be delivered promptly when we sat down. Most of us ordered the eggs on toast, and one friend ordered the caramelized banana french toast.The six of us decided to squeeze at a 4-person table to avoid the wait (there are probably 25-30 seats in total at Pimlico), and sure enough, our food came out pretty quickly!!! I had the scrambled eggs with salmon served on toast, and it was both generous and absolutely delicious. There were two large slices of sourdough topped with large slices of lox and heaps of scrambled eggs. The green onion and freshly cracked pepper garnish topped everything off. I was stuffed before I finished half of the plate, and my friends loved their dishes too. I probably wouldn't get the oatmeal, as one friend did. Great presentation but it looked kind of small (was served in a large cappuccino cup). Lattes were large and satisfying.Tl;dr - wonderful brunch food; long queues, so come early or come late! Will definitely be back.",

Ah... Now that's a good quiche. \u00a0A light flaky crust embraces the pie w nothing less than love. \u00a0Delicious.I can't help but to notice that the sun has arrived at the horizon landing itself onto a table of two. \u00a0Yes, although the grass is greener here, I have this urge to leave these green pastures for a brighter setting. \u00a0I don't have the courage for it might be possible I'd lay waste to all that I have over the greed of my very eyes. \u00a0Portions are big. \u00a0What lies on the other side of the horizon is the most lovely golden soft scrambles over toast that makes my mouth water like that of a damsel in need. \u00a0Each bite they take makes me wish it was me sitting where they are. \u00a0I'm afraid I will never get the chance to encounter such a beautiful scramble here at Pimlico Fresh. \u00a0If and when I'm in London again. \u00a0I will surely pay another visit. \u00a0Experience tells me that next time, my side will be greener and brighter. \u00a0A place w such good fresh food and a warm friendly helpful staff, this place will be missed and at one of my top faves for an amazing brunch. \u00a0For now, it's one last sip of my warm Darjeeling, and it is off to the Gatwick Airport to return to my homeland. \u00a0Farewell London. \u00a0My stay was short, but these fond memories are forever.",

The pie crust was flaky but it didn't collapse when I cut through it. The stuffing was moist and warm. The Spanish omelette was surprisingly big, but we finished all of it. They also serve many different flavours fresh smoothies that seem very popular. I can't wait to go back and try some. It's one of those cafes that no one will go across the town to visit, but you'd feel absolutely blessed if you've got one on your block.",

How did I reach my 4 stars rating? 1 star for location, 1 star for menu, 1 star for food taste, 1 star for service. The last star I give for a truly life changing food experience and this is great food but not amazing.

This place had a good feeling to it and it was brunch o'clock, so we ventured in.Your attention is drawn to the far wall which is prepared as a blackboard and has the menu. This is a plus for me for this style of restaurant. There is a communal table in the middle which is also something I like. You order at the counter, indicate where you plan to sit and they will bring it over to you when it's ready.There are options covering most tastes, but I went for the traditional bacon and eggs on toast. My wife had the sausages and eggs. Strangely, hers came with two pieces of toast while mine had one, but she gifted me the toast later so I didn't really miss out. For mine the scrambled eggs were overcooked, but the meal was fine.For drinks, I had a flat white and my wife had one of their freshly prepared juices: carrot and orange. These were ok, but I have had better coffee elsewhere.",

Located in a good location close to Westminster without being touristy. We ordered salmon and avocado on toast, bacon and avocado on toast and some coffee and tea. The staff was really really nice and everything came really quick. The whole atmosphere is lovely and the whole cafe is really nice designed. Most of their food is savoury but they do a couple of sweet cake options too. Our food was amazing, the bread was actual bread and so good! The portions were a bit small for the price but location wise that's what to expect. One star down as there's no toilet and the coffee didn't meet my expectations. I love coffee but had to put sugar into this one as it was too bitter. All in all a lovely little spot where I'll definitely return too!",

It was my first time trying one, and I must say I found love. For my second visit, I say down with my friends and I must say all of the food looks good! The make you want to drool type of good.

    "text": "Pimlico is one of these areas that try to convey elitism, at the same time, not having a lot to offer besides beautiful terraced houses. Bordering with other grander locations of London it faces extreme competition from them, lacking a distinctive character of its own that could be some sort of counterweight.Pimlico Fresh on the other hand brings a new wave of freshness to this a bit tedious district. It's a very small venue and it can be challenging to find a free seat. I believe this speaks itself about its reputation. So if you are planning to come here with a party of 10 people make sure you reserve the whole place beforehand :)If you are patient enough to wait for a seat like we did on that one Saturday afternoon you will be rewarded. Hearty food made straight from the heart. I went for steak and mushroom pie. Home made pastry, salad made with love and attention (you could see from chunks it was completely made from scratch). On top of that, you can get a freshly squeezed orange juice.As a frequent runner, I would suggest this place for a fulfilling healthy and nutritious post-workout brunch whenever you end up in the Victoria/Pimlico area.On the day, this meal followed my earlier swimming workout and that also worked equally well.If you sit at the big table and forget about London conventions you might even be able to have an odd banter with the regulars!I will definitely be back here. I was discussing food with one of the guests and quickly realized that French Savoury Toast looked to die for.This place also works as a great money saver, but that's besides the point. For me, it has already earned 5 stars.",

We went twice last weekend, and won't be going back. They've substituted volume for quality in their egg dishes, and they are very slow. Yesterday was the capper: we waited 25 minutes for our eggs, even though there were only four customers in the restaurant. When we checked on them, the staff apologized and brought them within a couple of minutes (they'd obviously forgotten them), but the fried eggs were massively overcooked.We'll just go to the Pret around the corner next time. At least it's cheap.",

We arrived at around 10 am in the morning and it didn't seem too packed, but the place is pretty small so just a few tables available therefore we opt to sit outside on the little table (which made for a beautiful photo though). I can't remember what my sister ordered but something with sunny side up eggs on top (photo will be posted) and i order the salmon and avocado toast! both were really delicious!! we also ordered the chicken salad and i'm not sure whether i was hungry or not but it was the best salad i've ever had!! i wish i was there again to try their other dishes! the only downside was when we ate outside we were getting attacked by bees!! it just kept flying towards us and our food!! not sure if there's like a hive nearby or just nature but regardless i know it isn't their fault. unfortunately it did make eating outside unpleasant so we had to move inside after the non-stop attack!",

We were sitting next to friendly folks and didn't mind crowding up to fit more, but if you get there late lunch hour you might end up with nowhere to sit. The staff was friendly and laid back. Overall, my impression was that this was quite a no fuzz eating space where you found men in suits and hipsters alike.The food was simple and fresh but still interesting. I had the chicken pastilla to which I could choose various salads from their salad bar. The coffee was excellent and the treats as well.",

It was delicious, but next time I might order what my friend had which was also very good. She let me have a bite- chilli eggs on toast. Yum. They have an interesting breakfast/brunch menu.

For lunch today they had on the chalk board steak and mushroom pie with a salad which my hubby got and I went for the not on the chalk wall but in the case and looking amazing Tuna Nicoise salad.We were both thrilled with our choices. His came with a heaping salad of beets, feta, peas, butternut squash and greens in a nice light dressing. The pie was full with steak, mushrooms and a nice sauce.My salad was exactly what I wanted. The green beans were firm, the eggs properly hard boiled and a nice balance of tomatoes and capers. The tuna was just the right amount. I did add a bit of balsamic and oil at home, but I am wondering if they would have had a dressing on hand. I also added half a baguette at home since it didn't come with any bread. But had we eaten in they had loads of breads to choose from to add on for a price.All in all this is a great spot to grab a quick bite. As I waited for the takeaway I saw people of all kinds come in and order and everyone looked satisfied.",

The kitchen takes up way too much floor space which means there is no room seats and tables.2. Rather than putting chairs and tables in, which can be pushed together for larger groups, they have gone for uber trendy and highly unpractical big wooden dining tables. This means if there is space to sit, you are usually sat far too close for comfort to random strangers. And given that this is in prime yummy mummy territory - good luck tackling the buggies!p.s - the fruit toast is fantastic!",

    "text": "Whenever I move to a new neighborhood or city, part of my ritual is to find a decent caf\u00e9 with comfy seating, yummy treats and most importantly good coffee. In London, that place has become Pimlico Fresh for me. I seriously heart Pimlico Fresh so much that I kina wish I could fold it up and take it back to SF in my suitcase, but for now I'll settle for it being my little Pimlico outpost. When I found out the neighborhood we'd be living in was kind of removed from the city center and a bit bougie, I was worried that there wouldn't be great veg options, but Pimlico Fresh has come to the rescue. They fulfill all three of my requirements and then some:1. Cute communal seating (a great way to have a nice conversation with someone new or just chill and read a book)2. Delicious fresh food including amazing vegan soups (Thai lentil the other day was rich and tangy), yummy vegan brownies (this is a hard one to perfect, I know I've tried!), and other assorted salads and muffins for veggie peeps.3. Very good soy latt\u00e9s (very important for the functionality of my brain). All that being said it has its quirks. One is that there is no public bathroom, which can be a bit of a pain if you want to settle in for a nice afternoon of reading with a cup of tea. Second, they seriously need some wifi up in there. Is this not a thing in London? Other than that P-fresh (yah, I said it!) rocks my socks. I definitely recommend it for veggie peeps and omnis alike and it will certainly be missed when I return to the states.",

For example, I was sitting at an intentionally unvarnished wooden table. Why not varnish the table? Because it feels older that way! The food was absolutely delicious here... I had baked eggs, and it was very solid. I could say it was some of the best baked eggs I've ever had, but it wasn't that much better than any other good baked eggs I've had. There were bits of chorizo in there, which I find awesome. I wouldn't mind if all my food came with bits of chorizo. They told me it would take 20 minutes to bring out the baked eggs, but it took about 14. It also came with toast that was perfectly buttered. Like the butter was already melted and distributed through the toast. And the nearest jar of Vegemite was just a few feet away. Booyah. I am coming back to you Pimlico Fresh.",
