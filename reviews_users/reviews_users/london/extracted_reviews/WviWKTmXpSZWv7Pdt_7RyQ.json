As it was close to Euston & the British Library we thought we'd give it a go.There's something lovely about it's no frills attitude, just an honest cafe doing full English breakfasts, sandwiches and lovely tea in a relaxed manner. I plumped for the scrambled eggs with a side of hash browns and Early Grey tea which hit the spot nicely.It was always busy but the staff took it all in their stride and we didn't feel as if we were being rushed to finish our meal quickly.",

I had a lox bagel and mocha for under \u20ac7. I enjoyed my time there so much I came back the next morning for avocado toast and tea. Would recommend to anyone.",

I'm an LA native, so I'm afraid I won't get to be a regular, but I totally would if I lived in London.BTW-- if you're into chai lattes, I have to say mine was pretty good. They have various flavors, but I just got a regular w/ soy milk. Next time I go, I may try their bubble tea as they say they've just started serving it!P.S.

    "text": "OMG this place is amazing!!! My first visit, I followed the advice of the fellow yelpers and got the Chai tea! The second time, I brought my friend from out of town, who asked how the tea would go with a shot of expresso. The guy behind the counter, Sam, goes \"well it depends if you like the taste of coffee- I have it all the time though.\" We do like the taste of coffee, and chai, so we braved it- oh, and what an excellent decision this turned out to be! You could barely (if at all) taste the espresso, and you get all the benefits of coffee espresso, combined with the delicious taste of chai tea! Delicious!!!I also got the sandwich with escarole, brie, tomatoes on the focaccia bread once (delicious), as well as the one with mixed veggies and spicy chicken that's always behind the counter (also delicious).Only two downsides to this place: they don't accept credit cards (but when I asked where the nearest ATM was, he said he could prepare it while I went 2 minutes across the road to grab some cash--quite nice), and it doesn't have wifi (SUCH a shame- this place would otherwise have been my new hangout! Sam was sweet and tried to be helpful-he said \"we don't have wifi, but if you go to Starbucks, they do I believe!\" Bless him). All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this place! Just make sure to bring some cash and a dongle and you could sit here all day while drinking coffee, getting some work done, and eating delicious sandwiches they prepare right in front of you! Delicious food, delicious coffee/tea, friendly staff, a nice place to sit and do some work-what more could you ask for??",

It's very clean in here and the savory food always tastes like pretty good quality even though from the outside the cafe really doesn't look like anything special. They also do a soya alternative to all the hot drinks which is a plus. One odd thing though, are their highly priced slices of cake that are rubbish and very cheap tasting. I've tried the so-called carrot cake and it was just a sponge cake with yellowy icing and a mini carrot made of icing on top, a definite no-no!The only real complaint I do have is that they play the radio far too loudly behind the counter which can be off putting whilst you eat, but for a snappy lunch here's OK to pop into.",

    "text": "What a great place to get a breakfast or a tea break near Kings Cross! After staying in the KIngs Cross area for three nights, I noticed that the station is surrounded with only chain stores - until I found Pompidou Cafe, which is a nice local cafe owned by two brothers and their father. Not only do they have a nice selection of drinks and pastry display, the menu is also enticing. The best part is that despite being so close to the main crossroad of central London transport, the price here is very reasonable - I got a breakfast plate and tea for only around \u00a310!Anyway, I recommend swinging by here if you are in need to eat or drink something or take a break when you are around Kings Cross!",
