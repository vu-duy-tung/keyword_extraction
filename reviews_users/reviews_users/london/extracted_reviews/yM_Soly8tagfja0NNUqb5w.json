Called chutney's after the vast choice of chutney's on offer with your meal, the food is delicious & the Cobra beers ice cold (Needed if you go for the hotter dishes/chutney's) I can't recommend the unbelievably cheap Sunday buffet highly, enough, the choice of dishes are vast & very varied, from mild to red hot, with a choice of breads & salads & if you have any room left, dessert. Anyone who thinks vegetarian food is boring & all the same, should take an advantage of a all day Sunday, or one of their weekday lunch time buffets, and sample what your missing!! (Might be best to wear elasticated waistband trousers tho, as you might bust a zip or button!!)

Most noteworthy, though, is their lunchtime and Sunday buffet. The range is incredible! It is full of healthy choices - vegetables somehow made to taste wonderful, fruits, chutney, of course - as well as curries and wonderful deserts.

Everything on the menu seemed delicious and they had a great vegetarian selection. My friend asked for the least spicy dish, which the waiter said would be the channa masala, so she ordered that and I ordered the Bombay Aloo, which was supposed to be very hot potato curry. But we realised after we started eating that her dish was actually spicier than mine, so we just split both of them. The waiter also gave my friend a complimentary side of yogurt to counteract the spiciness, which was very nice of him (and the yogurt was delicious). I enjoyed the channa masala more than the potatoes, because the potatoes were very large and I didn't think the dish had quite enough curry. I ordered coconut rice with my meal, which I didn't expect to finish, but I enjoyed it so much that I ate the whole serving. We also split garlic naan, which was very large and complimented the curries very well. The great service continued: After we finished dinner, the waiter brought us complimentary ice cream to share, telling us they they were about to officially start selling it the next day. We guessed the flavours were ginger, mango, and pistachio, and agreed that the pistachio was our favourite. It was a very refreshing end to a lovely meal, and only cost both of us about \u00a310. We came very hungry and left very satisfied, and we'll definitely be back for another dinner or for the lunch buffet.",

    "text": "This place was awesome! I got the Thali which came with 4 curries, 2 rotis, a gulab jamun dessert, and some raita yoghurt. I thought the food was amazing, and I had just studied abroad in India last semester, and this place had food almost nearly as good as I had eaten in western India. It was just more pricey than I was expecting (29 dollars/ 20 pounds). All in all, I would recommend this place. When I asked for the check/ cheque, however, the guy seemed annoyed that I did not use manners and say the words \"May I please have...\" Haha I guess that's not a thing we do in America. Normally in the U.S., the waiter brings us the check/ cheque the second after you finish your meal.",

I am a great fan of the arrangement in place on Sundays, when for the entire day they operate an all-you-can-eat buffet deal for a fixed price. Really delicious food: I've no idea what half of it is, but I pile it up on my plate and then return for a second helping of a similar amount. Highly recommended.",

They had this moist sponge cake like dessert with powdered sugar on top which was pretty good. \u00a36.95 for all you can eat and we saw people waiting outside at 11:50 right before they opened. Tons of locals which probably means it's one of the better places to try!;)",

The lunch buffet is under \u00a37 and comes with a large array of different dishes, each one delicious. I wish the bread they offered was a bit softer but that was my only real gripe about the food. The daal was delicious, my friend saying it was just like the ones she had when she spent a year in Sri Lanka. The dinner choices are great too and similarly cheap. I really enjoyed the saag paneer I had here. The service was pretty much what I'd expect, I've never had a bad experience with them.It's definitely a good choice if you're in the area, especially if you're veggie or have veggie friends you need to feed!",

    "text": "Oh Chutneys. I always leave you feeling uncomfortably full and sorely in need of a 4-hour nap. Drummond Street is lined with fantastic little Indian restaurants like this one. They do a vegetarian lunch buffet for \u00a37. They rotate the dishes, but there's usually a selection of 7-8 hot dishes and 4-5 cold salads, plus the usual sides of naan, rice, and lots of sauces.I'm not a vegetarian but every time I come here, the concept of moderation completely goes out the window. It's quick, delicious, and cheap -- what else could you want?",

    "text": "I came here for lunch one day with a bunch of co-workers because one of them was leaving and we were having a farewell lunch. In case you haven't figured it out, Chutneys is an vegetarian Indian buffet, and for lunch, it's a great deal as it's only \u00a36.95pp. Surprisingly, the food was pretty good. There were a few dishes that I thought were quite spectacular (the onion bhajis, the taro leaves and the cauliflower dish), but the curries themselves were just kinda average. I do prefer my curries a bit hotter. But they were quite nice. The desserts were actually quite good, and I'm a huge fan of Gulab Jamun. The only downside is the service. You're pretty much ignored once you give them your drink order. I did have to ask for water several times. But for less than a tenner and unlimited vegetarian curry, perhaps you have to make do.",

    "text": "Wouldn't recommend. I am surprised to read great reviews because I regret my visit. We ordered dahi bhalla chat. The vada was hard and didn't seem fresh at all. I suspect the imli chutney came from a jar from the spice shop next door. We also got a rava dosa which was actually great but was ruined by terrible chutneys and sambhar. What they called coconut chutney was a watery mix of coconut flakes, I have even used the same to make chutney at home because my blender can't grate well but even that comes out better than whatever this was. It also had a yogurty tanginess so only the cook knows what it was but wasn't coconut chutney. The sambhar was average. The masala tea was watery. Not sure if this is one of those places catering to mainly British crowd, if you are looking for authentic- don't waste your time and money.",

I came with my flatmate, and they didn't check with us once the entire time - we had to flag a server down to order, and then after they brought us our food, we waited a long time and flagged them down again for the bill. Good thing we were feeling chatty and not in a hurry.But the food was good enough that I almost went with 4 stars just for that. It's all vegetarian, which I love. The Chutney's Special dosa was especially delicious - a type of flatbread with a tasty dipping sauce. The price is also very reasonable, especially for London. I'd like to come back for the lunch buffet sometime, when I don't have to worry about the service!",

    "text": "This little gem is tucked away at the back of Euston Station, perfect as I was having lunch with as friend just before catching a train. I had one eye on the time so was relieved to find there was a buffet, eliminating the need to wait to be served (I imagine that may have taken as while as it was pretty busy) whilst offering a great selection of dishes to choose from, and all at the bargain price of \u00a36.95. The entirely veggie offerings included several curries, bhajis, bread, popadoms and a wonderful choice of salads. I sampled most of the dishes and whilst they were by no means the most mind-blowing Indian food I've tasted, they were all hearty, well spiced and not too greasy. For desert I was treated to a big plate of melon as well as some more traditional Indian sweets, perfect after the large main course. Although it was a little chaotic with the tightly packed tables full to capacity, the service was friendly and the atmosphere relaxed and pleasant. What a great find!",
