About to cross the street, the heavens opened up and gave us unrelenting rain...luckily for us we had worn our trainers and sprinted safely into Gallipolis inviting doorway. From the second we entered, we were greeted with warm smiles and atmospheric lighting. None of the staff batted an eyelash at our choosiness over sitting in the 'perfect table' and we had menus and water within moments. \u00a0Although all the tables surrounding us appeared to have ordered the 2 course set menu for 8.95, we opted for taking our chances and were not disappointed. I ordered the meat moussaka (7.45) and it was gorgeous, served piping hot and full of flavour. An unexpected plate of rice and salad followed and Turkish Apple tea was far tastier than Leon C. or I could have expected. \u00a0 Leon ordered the mixed kebap and found it surprisingly filling. The perfect end to our meal was the baklava but judging from the front window dessert display, there are many more decadent options. I would highly recommend giving Gallipoli a try, you will get more than your monies worth in service, atmosphere and quality.",

    "text": "Islington's Upper Street has a penchant for producing polished restaurants of Gallipoli's type. By this I don't refer to the two other Middle-eastern spots named Gallipoli in close proximity but to the type of experience one gets when visiting a successful and busy commercial restaurant like this. The staff are well-trained and courteous, the drinks are geared towards larger groups, and the menu is of a consistent quality, if not ground-breaking, and is priced competitively. In short, when you eat somewhere like Gallipoli, you are pretty much guaranteeing yourself a decent night out, if not a spectacular one. But I doubt whether this is anyone's favourite restaurant. The tables on the street, belly dancing, pitchers of cocktails, delicately spiced vegetable tagines, couscous with dates and lamb koftes are all very well, but I generally prefer to eat somewhere with a little more soul.",

    "text": "One of the plethora of restaurants on Upper Street in Islington, Gallipoli Again offers Turkish food in a heavily decorous atmosphere with the scent of incense burning in the background. With the decour being what drew me in, in the first instance, I was eager to give the food a try. After having my complimentary olives (which are on all of the tables), I was looking forward to my appetiser of hummus. I was kind of surprised that my hummus didn't come with pita bread, which I had to order separately. This kind of put me off to start with as it seemed a bit cheap, but I was well rewarded with my main course, which was a special of the night of a very large fillet of salmon on top of rice and roast vegetables. The main course was much larger than I was expecting, but it tasted fresh and delicious and I was very pleased. My partner's beautifully presented plate of spicy sausages and other accoutrements was equally pleasing to him so overall the food, on the extensive menu, seems to have a lot going for it. I think I would definitely try this place again if only to try more items off of the large menu. It was definitely a good choice for a pre-gig dinner.",

I had the portobello mushrooms with spinach and mozzarella, which was bursting with flavour and very tender mushroom. My main course was the lamb with some kind of potato/corn mush and rice and yoghurt, topped with a green pepper. The only thing I can fault with the place was that the service was really slow. The staff were very courteous and helpful, but the dishes took a long time to arrive, this despite the fact that it was a Sunday afternoon and half full when we sat down. Overall, not a bad place to eat, and pretty cheap, compared to the more expensive restaurants along Upper Street. Review by The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",

I had hummus and pitta bread to start. There was enough hummus for two! For the main I had the Harem Kebab, which is grilled chicken, surrounding a large bed of pitta pieces covered in some sort of yoghurt/cream.

I think there were five juicy king prawns grilled to perfection and a lovely crunchy, fresh side salad - certainly no scrimping on the portions here! for my main course i had the chicken shish kebab, which was an insane amount of lovely, perfectly flavoured, juicy grilled chicken and crunchy vegetables, crack rice (seriously this rice was SO good, i could have ate it forever - what do they put in here?!?!?!), and again a lovely, fresh side salad. YUM! i had baklava for dessert, as a baklava fan, this was a lovely way to round off the meal. I also thought they perfectly paced the food, leaving us enough room in between courses to actually be ready for the next (huge) portion of food we'd be shuffling down our faces.our waiter was great also as my dad ordered the profiteroles for his dessert - he came to say he only had one left, and as they served them in threes, he couldn't have that as his dessert. my dad said he would have the chocolate brownie, but when he came back to give my brother his (already pre ordered dessert), he informed my dad that this was the last one so he couldn't have that either. uh oh, dessert disaster for daddy!! he settled for the baklava, and when he was brought it our waiter happily announced \"i have something special for you!\" and put down his plate of baklava but also the one pesky remaining profiterole, which was a really nice touch!this is definitely a wonderful place to bring a group of people for a fun weekend treat, and i know i will be returning again and again. the menu had changed since the last time i came to one of the gallipoli restaurants, which is excellent as it means it's likely that i will be forced into trying something different each time i come. it is a bit troublesome though, as before i arrived i had my heart set on the chicken tagine with fruits that my mum had last time - and i couldn't get it! but in the end i was very happy with my new choice so all's well that ends well!",

This was the first time we were in this area, and I can assure it will not be our last. After a small amount of debate we landed at Gallipoli Again and we were NOT disappointed.To start this place has plenty of seating and being seated immediately on a Saturday night definitely enhanced our experience. Once seated we were greeted right away with a bowl of olives and given plenty of time to browse the menu and place our order.We opted to share selections off the 3 item fixed price menu and add on an extra main meal. What an tremendous amount of food we got! To start we had the mezze platter which was a beautiful and tempting display of hummus, potato and other salads with a bountiful bowl of bread. Everything was delicious and some flavors were new and unexpected. \u00a0If we had only ordered this we would have left full and content. But next up were the mains, my husband had the chicken shish and I had the falafel. Both were outstanding and way more then we could finish. But the icing on the cake, so to speak, was the baklava at the end. Served up on a plate with a bit of chocolate and raspberry sauce to dip - they were amazing! I would go back just for baklava and coffee sometime. The only reason I \u00a0didn't give 5 stars is the noise level. I understand it was a Saturday night and when its a birthday celebration they crank the music...but sitting out back on the porch it almost blew me off my seat and at times I actually covered my ears. All in all we will be returning to Upper Street and I can see Gallipoli Again in our future.",

There are another two Gallipoli's on Upper St, but they will be hard pushed to better this one.Great place for lunch or dinner.",

The food is reasonable, whilst not outstanding (and would have been better had it not arrived on freezing cold plates). The staff were very friendly and helpful, with a good sense of humour, and the whole place has a good fun feel about it. I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet romantic meal, but if you're looking for reasonably-priced Turkish food with a lively atmosphere on Upper Street, you could do a lot worse.",

From the moment we arrived, each and every staff member was friendly and welcoming- literally everyone said hello and welcome, with a huge smile! The Turkish/Mediterranean menu had a variety of meat grills, veggie options and tasty looking starters or mezes. As we were in a big group, quite a few of us opted for the group menu- this came with 6 mezes to share including falafel, feta parcels, hummus, broad beans and a mouthwatering aubergine and carrot dish with a spiced tomato sauce (best dish!). I selected the vegetarian moussaka for my main, which was delicious, but plate was cold- though in this case I'll allow the exception since we were a big group! Now the entertainment. This is THE place to come on your birthday...so long as you are comfortable with public dancing while standing on a chair! Our birthday girl was given a belly dance style wrap to wear, and soon enough our whole group was up and dancing to the cheers and hooting from the whole restaurant! Such a fun atmosphere, and the staff were just brilliant! Food was delicious, and incredibly reasonable prices. Three course meal plus wine and coffee for about \u00a330? Yes please! Perhaps my birthday dinner in 11 months is already decided??",

It was crowded, but they have a back garden with a retractable roof, so it only looks small from the outside. They have several combination specials on their menu (with different amounts of mezes and entrees). We did one with 6 mezes, which included hummus, eggplant (aubergines), chickpea salad, falafel, potato salad, and some other sauces. It was an excellent starter and not too heavy. We washed it down with glasses of the house red wine, which was smooth and despite the price, didn't taste cheap. For my entree, I had the Upper Street Special, which had lamb, chicken and beef skewered meats. I found it to be a great way to taste out the various foods they had available. My favorite was the lamb, though the beef patties were also good. Our meal package also came with dessert (three courses for around 20 GBP/person). I had the funky pie, which had a nutty exterior and a creamy interior. Very sweet. Our table also had an order of Turkish coffee, which wasn't great.By far, the most memorable part of our dining experience was the service. Our waitress was great to speak to, and was the designated belly dancer whenever someone decided it was their birthday or bachelor party. Throughout the duration of our meal, we witnessed the lights turn down, music turn up, and our waitress dancing on chairs at least 4 separate times. To be fair, she also gave me a flaming shot and made me dance with her after I told her it was recently my birthday. There are videos of that somewhere...",

    "text": "I was very pleasantly surprised by this place and would definitely recommend a visit.First, the manager and wait staff are actually Turkish, which is usually a plus in terms of authenticity.On a Saturday night around 8:30 it was packed. It had been clearly been packed for at least an hour before that as well and was still packed by the time we left around 10. Definitely make reservations in advance or you will struggle. What's interesting about this place is that it's the second one of the group. Gallipoli is the original restaurant, just a few doors down, and it became so popular they opened up this restaurant. I was very sceptical because usually the original is the best and the second iteration declines in calibre. I will admit, I haven't been to the original, but I have no complaints about this place, so I'm not sure how that one would be better.Beyti Sarma - this is essentially adana kebab (minced lamb on a skewer) wrapped in a lavash and cut up into individual pieces (maybe 10 pieces or so). It's topped with a yoghurt and tomato sauce. It's definitely a more unique kebab and less common than the adana or the iskender and worth a try if you're in the mood for something different. Great dish, but the texture of the lamb could've been a bit better. Lavash was great as were the sauces.Mix Salad - even though this is a side order, the portion was still pretty good. This wasn't the classic shepherd salad, but close. It had tomatoes, cucumbers, red and green peppers, and parsley.Turkish Bread and Pitta Bread mix - you can order full baskets of just one, but you can also opt to do half and half. The pitta bread is the clear winner for me, but some people prefer what they call Turkish bread. The pitta is a soft, thin, not-dry, good quality pitta. The \"Turkish Bread\" is a round, spongey bread chopped into pieces.The ambiance is nice, the wait staff is nice, the food is great, I would highly recommend this place.",

Then I moved once again to South London... and you guessed it - I still come here for the Gallipoli Special Grill.What makes Gallipoli so worth coming back to? Quality and consistency. The food is amazing, and I always get the Special Grill because I can't decide on which kind of meat to go for (Special Grill has lamb, chicken, kofte, lamb chop and chicken wing). Everything is prepared very well, and never once have I been disappointed - which is saying something because I believe I've built up a pretty high expectation over my visits. Every time it delivers - and it will be a sad sad day when it doesn't, but I don't think it will happen.The decor is what others would describe as \"fab\" and the service is always friendly. Do yourself a favor and go for a meal here. It might have you consistently traveling across the city when the craving calls.",

The staff was cheerful and welcoming. I didn't \u00a0have chance to visit again but love to go back soon.",

    "text": "Delicious ! Nice deco ! Amazing menu !Great wine list as well !The only \"down\" point is the space: it's so narrow between the tables that you get squeezed everytime someone wants to sit anywhere near you...Waiters could also be more responsive and better coordinated (i.e. a waitress came to ask for our orders right after her colleague came, and we had to ask several times for addtional glasses for the water...).Everytime a good time, though ;o)",

    "text": "Eating here is like Deja Vu for the Stomach. \u00a0Because you are eating the same food as the other Gallipoli locations on Upper street, but just in a different setting with different decor, and different people. \u00a0I was not disappointed. This time I tried one of the many teas highlighted on the menu. \u00a0It is fresh loose leaf tea, just like I like it, and as fantastic as everything else here.",
