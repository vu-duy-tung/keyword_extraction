    "text": "I would like this place a lot better if I hadn't tried the food. The pub is conveniently located inside King's Cross so you can grab a pint while you wait for the train. It's got an old-timey Victorian feel which I'm guessing is replicated and not genuine, but even so they've done a good job of it and it feels really cozy and atmospheric inside. Even the toilets have old-fashioned pull handles on the top.However, the food is not as interesting as everything else. I got the fish and chips and hubby got a chicken and leek pie. Both were okay standard pub food. Not bad but nothing special - probably not home made but reheated from whatever central location they send stuff out to the Fullers chain pubs. The fish/chips came with tartar sauce but no salt or vinegar. We even had to snag someone to get some ketchup. The fish was pretty heavily breaded and little oily. Like I said, what you'd expect from mediocre fish/chips. The chicken/leek pie came with mashed potatoes but no gravy. Very dry potatoes. Not enough liquid in the pie to make up for it. Why would you send out mashed potatoes without gravy? Not impressed.Like I said, drinks only - 4 stars, food - 2 stars.",

We saw a server but she ignored us and didn't return, so we walked back to the bar and asked if there was somewhere we should be waiting or if we should seat ourselves. The reply was, \"If you want.\" So we sat down and waited. The same server passed us several more times but never greeted or acknowledged us at all, even when I made an effort to politely catch her eye. We sat there for about 20 minutes with no service or greeting until we finally gave up and left. We went to the wine bar across the street and they served us immediately. I see that this restaurant gets good reviews, so maybe this was an off day? It wasn't just bad service, it was *no* service. We won't be returning.",

For someone who has spent their formative years in New Street's dingey Shakespeare and Euston's pokey Doric Arch, the airy atrium, abundance of seating and decent beer choice were an unexpected breath of fresh air. So as I walked in I was set on 5* but oh the service...At 3pm bar staff outnumbered punters 5 to 1, so being ignored for 5 mins wasn't the greatest. It's not the first time that's ever happened to me but it was the first time I've ever been ignored while being served. It is a rare skill to be able to communicate without looking at someone and only using 7 words, but this guy managed it with aplomb. The beer was tasty but at \u00a35.40 a pint was just expensive enough to make this a 3* review.My advice would be to give this place a go and hope that the poor service was a one off...but don't bank on it.",

Serves a decent range of 'pub grub' done right, including a Sunday Roast. A favourite is the chicken, ham & leek pie but I've found all the food to be above standard (even the husband, who avoids 'gastropubs' at all costs likes it here)There's a number of different seating areas, so I've always been able to find a table when going in, but it's a fairly popular place and busy (noisy) at standard meal times. Some areas appear to have table service (at least the area we sat in one Sunday did), and this services proved friendly, if a teeny bit haphazard. The prices aren't the cheapest, but then in London where is? (No seriously, if you know somewhere cheap and good, tell me!)I would happily return here as it's convenient, but it's not necessarily somewhere I would go far out of my way to visit.",

It's located right next to platforms 9-11 (which is great for me as that is usually where my trains leave from). You may now know it's there as you have to go up some stairs.I expected The Parcel Yard to be small and lame. Boy was I wrong. There's a huge pub there with \"outdoor\" seating. There are a bunch of small rooms to hang out for a bit of privacy as well. There is also a digital display showing when the trains are leaving so you don't miss your train.The decor looks kind of classic British pub. Everything is made of wood! They also had six(!!!) cask ales on draught to choose from. While most of them were Fullers (as it is a Fullers pub), there were some guest ales as well. But it's not often you find that many cask ales available! We only got one pint as we only had a half an hour to kill and they actually were closing up around 11:30 as well.I was thoroughly pleased and surprised at my visit to the Parcel Yard and will definitely come back! Maybe if I have enough to drink I can go downstairs and make a fool out of myself at the nearby Platform 9 3/4...",

The menus are seasonal but stick to the English gastro-pub theme making it well worth coming back to try something new.It's such a nice pub that we don't rush for trains any more as we'll rather pop in for a swift-half, take our time, and get the next one.",

A pub lunch of potted shrimps, salt beef sandwich, Cornish crab baked with a salad, roast beef and a roast pork sandwich...all for about 25 quid!!!The food was sensational, the setting unique, the toilets well kept, creatively designed and CLEAN...the staff chatty and helpful. This was not how I remembered Kings Cross station from the 1980's with it's stale sandwiches and weak British rail tea......the new design of the station building is to use the most overused 'Americanisim'....AWESOME!

Lots of wood, big comfy leather chairs and the odd wooden stool and low table, industrial-style light fixtures and big windows. Range of beers is great, and as the venue itself is big you don't feel so packed in like sweaty sardines, which is the norm in a lot of pubs in the Kings Cross area. The location is also fantastic when you need to meet up with people who commute to London: they can quickly stumble downstairs to the nearby train platforms, thereby lengthening total available drinking time.Now for the food: I've eaten once from the restaurant menu and once from the bar menu. I recommend the restaurant over the bar as the menu changes frequently, representing seasonal availability. I've had the butternut squash salad which was very good, but the portion was a bit small. I find choices on the bar menu far too fatty overall and provided in overpriced, small portions. I was very disappointed by the calamari rings, which were fried to death in a very heavy onion-ring batter which was greasy and overpowered the calamari entirely. My advice: Stick with the beer and have no fear.",

It was nice to finally sit down and enjoy our last English meal before we traveled on to our next destination. Had a great experience and that was all by chance I suppose; you see we were just at kings cross station to jump through platform 9 3/4 & check out the Harry Potter shop, but we needed to get some fish & chips as our last meal in London. So I searched for the closest Fish & Chips to us & thus The Parcel Yard popped up! Really, get the Battered Cod & Chips! It's HUGE",

On the evening we went there was a football game on and the mood was very fun and exciting! I could see myself spending many evenings here relaxing. Beer selection was awesome, great variety of different Fullers beers and I liked them all. I know we tried the honeydew (I wanted a little more flavor out of it), the seafarers, London Pride, and olivers island. My favorites were the London pride and olivers island. The food was also phenomenal! \u00a0I had the chicken, ham and leek pie. This was both of our favorites. The sauce was super yummy and had a lot of flavor. I could drink a pint of that sauce! Their fish and chips were also very solid and didn't taste like it had been frozen and thawed like it does at some pubs. Highly recommend for a fun time with a young crowd.",

Set at the back of the station, mean that you would not just pass it.Spread over two floors it has views across the King's Cross station platforms. It also has a really attractive indoor courtyard with a glass ceiling. It is tastefully furnished and retains the feel of being part of a station, as opposed to just a pub. There are lots of little rooms, as well as a seperate dining area, the atrium court, and the main bar. The Parcel Yard has a large selection of real ales, as you would normally find in a Fullers pub. It also serves up the standard pub menu with a mixture of gastropub type dishes. There are so any good places to eat in the area, I don't think I would make a point of eating here.If your at Kings Cross and looking for a pint, this place would be a good place to enjoy a drink. It's not the sort of place I would go out of my way for though, or somewhere I would look to enjoy an evening out.",

I wouldn't say that they have the most amazing drinks and food, but they definitely punch above what I had expected. It's actually quite nice inside (and clean!), and doesn't carry any of the station pub stigma that can come with such a place... highly recommended if you have a bit of time to kill in the station and would prefer a pub to the other offerings. There's normally plenty of room as well as the place is deceptively large. Depending on the time I had I would typically wander to somewhere a bit local, but now it's here... nice and close(ish) to the platforms, no need to venture further for a pint.",

The staff were fantastic, we sat upstairs and when they saw me head for the downstairs bar, which has the larger selection of beer, they offered to have my order sent up for me! I didn't eat here but I will next time I need a bite at Kings Cross station. They'll have a hard job beating Honest Burger which is just around the corner...

Especially after I recently had the most filling butternut squash fritter salad with pomegranate seeds and avocado - delicious - so delicious I went back again for dinner with another friend just so I could have it again. Any place that has a good veggie option is a plus for me but from what I have seen of others food they seemed to like what they got. All looked like good pub food to me but not super dooper gastro pub stylie!! \u00a0The Parcel Yard is very close to home for me and I have popped in with friends for a quick drink, popped in for a quick meal with significant others and even booked an area to host a fancy dress Un-birthday party. The atmosphere is very classic waiting room style. there are little booths with sofas and tables, a bigger dining room area with various tables and chairs, quite low lighting but not low enough that you can't see, and you can look out from the windows down on to the trains too. There is also an upstairs with good floor space. Various chairs and tables and room for a small gathering!!On tap you will find an array of pints, a number from local brewers and speciality brewers too which is a bonus. Food prices are pretty reasonable and all in all it has always been a pleasant affair when I have visited. Staff are kind, we got a free drink when they thought they had taken too long with our dinner, which we didn't feel was a long time to wait but they offered so that was nice. There is table service in the dining room but you often have to grab the waiters attention to order quickly so if you are in a rush and a waiter hasn't seen you I would suggest going to the bar. All in all, definitely recommended whether you are killing time or are in the area for a quick visit. And it is next to Platform 9 3/4!!Enjoyxyz",
