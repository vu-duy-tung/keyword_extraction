I'm obsessed! I don't know if it was the delicately flavoured coriander-lime rice, the comforting mushy beans, the crisp salad or the chunky guacamole, the fact there was no leakage out of the substantial wrap or perhaps all of those things in combination, but I haven't been able to shut up about the place since. If someone offered me a days work doing something really crap near Fleet Street I'd probably say yes just so I could get lunch at Chilango's. Apparently they're closed at the weekend though - boo! Vegetarian options: veggie burritos / tacos / saladVegan options: as above minus sour cream / cheese (the rice and guacamole are dairy free)",

Chilango is the closest thing to a Norcal burrito, not in the El Faro or Mission taqueria way, but more like the chainy Chipotle / La Salsa/ Baja Fresh / leaning towards Tex Mex kinda way... Which is still good because it does the trick. It satisfies. \u00a0And, you get a nice, fat, flavor filled burrito. \u00a0If you're looking for something slightly more \" authentic\" like the killer LA / SD burritos, you're not gonna find it here. \u00a0What you will find is a good, solid Tex Mex-y burrito. Personally, I dig their steak and veggie burritos. They hit the spot. \u00a0I definitely recommend this place is you need a burrito fix.",

To start with, the staff mixed up my order at the start (wrong beans) but the woman who did it apologized right away and I really didn't mind and just went with it anyway. I just wish that the horrible blond woman at the 'hot sauce and lettuce' area at the end of the counter had showed the same concern! She outright ignored me and spoke instead to the bald chappie beside her that yells out the orders. Even though I asked several times for hot sauce she continued talking to her colleague. When she finally made eye contact with me she had already rolled my burrito. When I politely asked again 'could I have hot sauce' she stopped, stared at me and then rolled her eyes. The bald guy asked her again reluctantly 'could we get some hot sauce on that', and she obviously annoyed unrolled it and then COVERED IT IN HOT SAUCE! She wouldn't stop when I was saying repeatedly 'Stop! That's enough!\" It was pretty much rendered inedible! Then to add insult to injury, the bald guy handed my husband one of their printed order forms and told us it would be much easier if we just filled the form out in advance! As if WE were the problem! The RUDEST service ever. \u00a0I love burritos but \u00a0could not ever bring myself to drop another dime in a place that allows staff to show outright contempt for their customers. AVOID!!!",

I came here because Tortilla wasn't open on Sunday evening, and after checking the Yelp reviews on my mobile I decided what the hell. The reason I was so prejudiced against this place to begin with is that the bright neon decor is very cheesy and offputting. When I think of mexican fast food I think cheap looking, slightly dirty/sketchy, metal chairs (which is something El Burrito in Bloomsbury captures well). Chilango, on the other hand, looks like a douchey Miami nightclub... so I figured this would be totally inauthentic.Well, the food probably was a bit inauthentic, but in a way that's comparable to a lot of American burrito joints like Baja Fresh and Chipotle. So really pretty good for if you hold it to that kind of standard! And apparently there is/was a promotion where if you add them on Twitter you get a coupon for a free burrito.p.s. Whoops I meant to review the one in Islington, my bad! They're probably similar anyway.",

I hope they're well paid because Chilango has some of the best customer service I've seen in London. They also have no problem throwing in little extras.

Were it not for the fact that I don't quite work close enough to go there regularly, I could easily eat here every day. Suffice to say that he burritos and tacos are excellent. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is vibrant, even when the place is full of bankers on a weekday lunchtime. I love that the entire kitchen is visible through a glass wall, and the whole operation is efficient and friendly.

Their burrito rollers could also improve their technique, as mine tend to fall apart (maybe get bigger tortillas so they can be longer and less fat?). Still, the taste and feeling are right on the money, you'll feel pretty much like you're on the west coast/california at a better than average mexican joint, though not quite the kind of place real mexicans would go to (better than chipotle la salsa etc., not as good as a real mexican place).",

Much fanfare, FREE FOOD. Free beer, long queues etc etc. The people cheered, reviews flew in, people talked but now the dust has settles I see 5 members of staff looking bored out onto the street with 3 or less customers in branch. Maybe things are going well and they just made a batch for the delivery boys to take to offices high up in sky, or maybe like I fear, even good places seem expensive for people trying to spend less at lunch except for that Friday team extrangance. I loved my first taste of Chilingos, they totally took me back to California with a lovely beef chilli burruito and a stunning bottle of Pacifico beer. Simply stunning importing that one, it is a great beer. The food has been discussed here and I would say it was really spot on, but the portion size itself was a bit wrong as all the cheese was in one corner bite for me. I will go back, just to give those people something to do. Like get me some munch and a Pacifico fro the fridge. One thing they might have got wrong is the opening hoursit is open from lunchtime to late at night, but closed weekends. Tourists still walk that street at weekends, they should take advantage.",

Quoting Wikipedia:'Chilango is a Mexican slang demonym for a person from or living in Mexico City or its surrounding areas. It may have a negative connotation when used by someone in one of the 31 States of Mexico...Those from the city also consider that any non-Chilango who uses the term does it in a derogatory fashion.'Basically, the restaurant is named after a Mexican slur that is viewed as negative when used by outsiders. I remember looking at the decorations at this branch and reading the captions making light of this fact and outright enjoying employing this name that is offensive to a certain group. I left astounded and haven't been back.Yeah, I suppose some people would say I'm nit-picking, but I'm really just looking out for American's southern neighbors. And I don't want them to get offended because they make REALLLY good food. And that's my beef with Chilango.",

    "text": "On the hunt for burritos for lunch from work, I spotted Chilangos on Google Maps. I am somewhat of a \"burrito lover\" and so was intrigued to go and check out it. Having arrived I was impressed by what looked like a short queue outside, that was until I got inside and realised it was 5 times as long. That being said it moved along quickly enough and I was at the counter in about 5 minutes or so of waiting. The counter was stuffed full of the usual options black-pinto-refried, no surprise there, but I was shocked to see the ridiculous prices. Nearly 6 pounds for a chicken burrito and 80p for additional guac??? I know I heard a fellow burrito-buyer squawking about how the place is stuffed full of Goldman Sachs employees, and probably explains the high concentration of Americans, but really? \u00a36.60 for a burrito with guac? Having been used to 5 dollar burritos in the US, the price of London-burritos is definitely something i find hard to swallow. To me Chilango is just another burrito joint with extortionate prices, and I will no doubt be heading to Whitecross street or some other direction in future when I feel like I need to douse that inner devil in me! All round good flavour, quick service, just lousy prices and no substantial advantage for them.",

    "text": "I'm from Texas and have been in London (which I love) for 5 years. But I've tried all over town, and no matter how hard I've searched, I've not been able to fill the burrito-shaped hole in my heart/stomach. There are \"mexican\" and \"tex-mex\" places dotted around the capital but one thing they typically have in common is sub-par fake mexican cooking. Then Chilanogs came. The burrito gods smiled kindly on me the day Chilangos threw open its doors 2 minutes from my work. The steak is well marinated and couldn't be more tender - charred on the outside and pink in the center (re). The pulled pork is simmered to perfection. Every time I go in, the pulled pork and steak battle in my head for a place in my stomach - I try to give them both equal opportunities (both always get the job done). In an attempt at a healthy eating plan for 2010, I'm trying to get the burrito salad more than the burrito. This plan typically fails me when I get to the register as I always feel deserving of the chips and salsa as well. But you've got to treat yourself, or you could go crazy. My one (big) complaint is that Chilangos used to sell a 250ml bottle of Hardy's Cab Sav (with its own plastic cup) - which my work colleagues and I would drink at our desks when working late. Amazing. Apparently, though, we were the only people to buy the wine and Chilangos has stopped selling it. If they ever bring it back, please try it (its hard to get any work done at night w/out this). At least they have a good beer selection. To Recap:Taste = fantasticStaff = friendly, professional (and they smile)Location = couldn't be betterPrice = it's fine and you're going to be full Suggestions:- Please bring back the wine COME TRY IT!",

When I came across this restaurant (which was hard to miss, it's poppy and bright decor is magnetic and fun) it sounded like a fun concept to me and a rather cheap lunch.I tried a Conchito (shredded pork) Burrito without the rice but extra cream and cheese for around \u00a36. You can watch it being made by a Mexican chef along the assembly line, and somehow the final result is always bigger than you anticipate, the eyes are always bigger than the stomach, are they not? The food was great, but the real clincher was the Mexican Pacifico beer that I washed it down with - hands down my favourite drink in the world.",

Their chips/guac and lemonade to be avoided though, in my opinion.The other week I got here really early and leisurely stuffed my face in front of an ever growing queue, which was awesome. The queue itself is also a highlight though, because you get to see them doing things in the kitchen, like slicing medium rare juicy steak.Top tip: get more than one type of salsa!

They use chicken breasts with the skins on so there is always a nice crispiness in your burrito.The usual selection of pinto beans and rice are always hot, and the salsas are delicious. I opt for a combination of medium and mild, the mild tomato salsa is juicy and crunchy with good coriander flavours. Guacamole is extra (standard for London) but delicious. Last time I went I also sampled the tacos which were fresh flour tacos as opposed to traditional corn.The decor is quirky and fun with lucha libre masks on mannequin heads and a large avocado and burrito themed graffiti mural the length of one wall.The queues can be long but the friendly and efficient staff mean the wait is never long.",

    "text": "Having lived in San Francisco for some time last summer I've been absolutely desperate to seek out a burrito place in London that does anything even remotely similar to Gordo's mind-numbingly good burritos. This place is certainly the best I've found. I was wandering around Ludgate Hill feeling hungry today when I stuck my head in the door, there was a bit of a queue (this being around 2pm on a weekday) but plenty of places to sit. The d\u00e9cor was modern and stylish and clean too. I queued up and was a bit miffed to find the staff treat you a bit like they do in Subway, they expect you to know the process, luckily I do but I felt a bit sorry for someone who didn't. I had a beef steak burrito with mild salsa, pinto beans and cheese. Oh my god. It was so tasty. Wrapped in tin foil just like in San Francisco and fat as my arm. I have one or two gripes though, the rice was white rice with some herbs in it not Spanish rice like in the Mission. The tortilla chips were not free and it wasn't served in a basket with the wax paper but .. meh who am I to complain? The beef was amazing, it was juicy and there was tonnes of it, the whole thing stayed together fairly well (although a bigger tortilla could have prevented the spilitting that happened towards the end). When I asked for a glass of tap water there was some confusion but I got it eventually and for \u00a35.90 it made a fairly cheap lunch well, just as expensive as a Pret or McDonalds would have been. If I worked near here I honestly doubt I'd eat anything else. I wouldn't go waaay out of my way to eat here but I'd certainly go a bit out of my way.",

Normally having to queue for things drives me mad, however at Chilango for some reason all it served to do was heighten my anticipation for the arrival of the parcel of meaty, ricey goodness. Especially mouthwatering was having to queue past the large windows of the kitchen, where the staff were preparing the next bins full of gorgeous marinated meat. It's a very tough gig to try to explain why something's great when there's no one particular thing that stands out about it, other than that it's... well, great! The amount of each burrito ingredient was fine, it was rolled right so when you bit it you got a good mixed mouthful, the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and the assembly was such that it didn't fall apart in your hands. This is a textbook example of a great burrito, and the only thing preventing me from going there more often is the fact that I've got to go past several other great burrito places to get there. However I'm looking forward to the next time I do!",

I used to stick to tacos which actually weren't too special but satisfied my Mexican food craving. Now I've switched to naked burritos - they leave me feeling less guilty afterward and are actually pretty good. Recommended.",
