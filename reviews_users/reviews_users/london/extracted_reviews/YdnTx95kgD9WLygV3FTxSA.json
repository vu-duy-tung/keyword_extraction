    "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes this place is absolutely amazing! From reading the only other review of The Port House, I'm assuming it's not been open very long, but it's already a winning formula for me. I came in here last night for dinner because it was right next to the Adelphi Theatre which is where I was heading afterwards! Upon arrival I loved the place. Candlelight, leather seating, bare stone walls, and fantastic staff. My waiter Eric was not only smouldering Spanish in an Enrique Iglesias way, he was also a fantastic server. Upon arrival I was handed the drinks menu, a special gin menu, and a large glass bottle of water. I love some complimentary table water. I ordered a Hendricks and tonic off the gin menu, which came in a huge fish bowl type wine glass, and was delicious. From the menu I ordered Patatas Bravas, deep fried cubes of potato in a fiery tomato sauce and garlic mayo, Confitado de Pato, confit duck leg served with a membrillo sauce, and Lubina, pan fried sea bass on a bed of lentils with a cream reduction. After ordering, the 3 small dishes came out within 20 minutes. I love tapas food on a normal day, but this was the best without a doubt I've ever had. The duck was slow cooked to perfection, and the quince paste that came with it was sticky and sweet and gorgeous. The potatoes were soft and the sauces were lovely, and the sea bass was cooked exceptionally well and fell apart into the beautifully cooked lentils and cream reduction. I was probably making inappropriate noises whilst eating this magnificent food. I rounded my meal off with a raspberry sorbet, which was a bit tangy but the raspberry flavour was intense and delicious. My bill came to a phenomenally cheap \u00a330, which I couldn't believe. Normally excellent food is expensive, no? Definitely get in here, I will be coming back.",

There were 7 of us and we each chose two dishes but we just shared everything between us. I can't remember all of the dishes that we chose but mine were the plato de carne caliente (hot spanish black pudding, chorizo & pancetta) which turned out to be a HUGE portion and the Brochetas de Gambas al Ajillo (prawn skewers with garlic and chilli) which were absolutely astounding. Special mention also goes to the asparagus and calamari too!As it was lunch no alcohol was involved but the wine list here is pretty impressive so there's definitely something to please everyone!",

The first thing we noticed when walking in was everyone having a gin and tonic in large bubble glasses. They were delicious! We ordered several different plates and loved them all. The cheese and meat plates allow you to try each type offered by the restaurant. \u00a0The fried pepper with sea salt was the perfect amount of salt. We also loved the papas in a spicy tomato sauce and garlic aioli. The service was very good when we first arrived. As the restaurant got busier it was a little slower, but that was to be expected.We spent a few hours here enjoying drinks, food and friendship. The lighting and atmosphere make you forget about what's going on outside the doors. Highly recommend checking this place out!",

After a mistake on my part in booking a restaurant, we tried to look around for somewhere good to eat, and even though the place is tiny, it really is a gem.The cured meats are delicious, and they give you crackers and pickled peppers that compliment them very well. For those that aren't very familiar with cured meats, you might wanna start slow since the flavor is strong. Unless you're an adventurous foodie, then just go for it.But for something more filling, we went for the lamb stew. It is quite rustic, as you'd expect, but it was truly delicious. It was seasoned beautifully and tender.We then went for more exciting dishes, getting the salmon and foie gras. The foie wasn't nearly as rich as I normally expect from foie, but nonetheless it was delicious. Can't go wrong with foie and apples. The salmon was draped on top of a light yet rich mayo with a kick of what I think is wasabi and/or dill. These two were probably the highlights of the meal, and these particular dishes we went back for seconds and even thirds.Feeling fantastic about these first couple of dishes we started to have the confidence, mood, and appetite to order a lot more. On top of these were the scallops, baby squid, sea bass, and duck, all of which were done with technical excellence and a great attention to detail, such as seasoning the garnishes.This place really is fantastic, and I would no doubt visit more often, and with a friend or two, if we didn't live across the Atlantic ocean.",

Atmosphere was lively and relaxed. Walk past the bar to the reception area, and saw there's a dining area on the other side. Very intimate feel with nice warm hues of candles lighting up the space. Service is friendly. Got seated when estimated time was reached. Everyone was busy, but helpful. I asked for recommendations and the server was great.Ordered the the Pisto with Fried Egg, Chipirones a la Plancha, and Spanish Tortilla with a glass of wine from Portugal. I asked the server if it would be too much, she initially said it would be fine. Later came back and told me she didn't put in the Spanish Tortilla order in case the food was too much, but would be more than happy to place the order once I saw the dishes come out. I thought it was super great of her to do that.Overall food was flavorful, vibe was nice and intimate, suitable even for a party of one. Looking forward to trying the other dishes on the menu.",

We had many different tapas and loved them all. Here are some of our choices - deep fried prawns, slow cooked duck confit leg, a trio of croquettes, duck canelloni, and some other items I can't recall. Everything was fabulous! We sat at the bar and helped ourselves to delicious roasted and salted marcona almonds. I don't know if we were supposed to help ourselves, but no one was there to stop us! Yummy!

It's quite unassuming from the outside, but inside the wine cellar vibe/decor was very welcoming and appealing. We stepped in at about 7:30 on a Thursday night to see a few groups waiting for tables. To avoid the wait (which actually ended up being quite short ) we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. Then we opened a tab, and leisurely drank and sampled various tapas. Though they specialize in wines/ports/sherries from Spain and Portugal, they have a good selection of other adult beverages as well. The tapas menu has a large variety of choices to suit whatever your tastebuds are currently craving, including vegetarian. Everything we had was good. A few favorites, though, were Patatas Bravas con Alioli, Albondigas, and for dessert- Crema Catalana.All of the bartenders and servers we dealt with were very nice and helpful. They seemed to enjoy their jobs, their coworkers, and their customers, which is quite refreshing!This was probably our favorite restaurant of the many we visited in London. So enjoyable! It will be a must visit when we come back!",

We also had the Tostas de Habitat y Feta which were veggies and feta served on toast. It was very tasty. The wine selection was great and the service was very good.",

We've eaten at many fine dining, tapas, and wine bars across the US. The Port House tops them all. Sorry Julian Serrano. Because of our Texan accent, the waitress misunderstood one of the dishes we ordered. They took care of it without question. Don't miss The Port House whether you're traveling here from abroad or a local.",

The inside will make you think you've been transported to an old wine bar somewhere in Portugal or Spain. With plenty of tapas to choose from, tastings of Port, a pretty extensive wine list, and even a menu of different types of gin and tonic, I'm sure you'll find something to eat, drink, and be merry about.We started with some peppers, a cheese plate, and some jamon, and didn't need anything else after that, but we were convinced to take a look at the dessert menu. Sure, why not. It's totally ok to split something, right?The Portuguese pie (Pastel De Natas) was incredible, although the waiter said next time to definitely try the Churros Con Chocolate - not sure I'll be able to resist!",

The servers were a bit rushed taking orders but I'm sure that's because of how busy they were late in the evening. We started with a couple glasses of wine and a gin+tonic (one of their specialities). Drinks were delivered promptly and they took our orders. The food started arriving shortly there after and the entire table agreed on just how delicious the food was. The pork belly I'll highlight was awesome. Crispy outside and amazing taste. The seafood and other meat dishes are equally as tasty. We ordered a second round of tapas. And finally desert, the churros and creme bruele. All around a most enjoyable evening and a great value including the 5 drinks and cocktails, food and desert. Would recommend without hesitation.",
