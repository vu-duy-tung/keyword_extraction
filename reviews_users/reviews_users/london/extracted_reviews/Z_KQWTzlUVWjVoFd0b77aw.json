You will notice easily the cup of hot choc/ coffee this shop served is like no others, as the richness of the chocolate oozes out from the cup and beautifully cascades on the side of the cup, making the drink look choco-sexy! That day, I decided to go for this \"fatoption\". Once inside, it is like a little Rome in London, cozy environment instantly sweeps off your weariness of city life. And I instantly felt lighter. I sat down next to the toasty fireplace, mesmerised by the not-burning-the-makeshift-wood-fireplace, and the shiny metal chocolate moulds adorned on the wall in the shop.I ordered a hot chocolate , medium size, and a strawberry cheesecake. I told you guys I went for the FAT OPTION, didnt i ! lol anyways, somehow, I made my medium chocolate... with triple chocolate... (god knows what that means, I just saw it later on my bill), it was delightful, high quality, thick , but believe it or not, not sickly sweet AT ALL! I was spooning it constantly in my mouth, and alternate it with a mouthful of the creamy strawberry cheesecake. I was over the moon. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at SAID and just wish I have had it before my workout, and not after.This IS the place if you are in need of a sugar fix.",

They still made us wait outside in the cold before we could go in to buy them.Once in we were ignored a while and finally got the attention of someone to take us through what the chocolates were as the labels were not visible. We went for 4 chocolates which came to \u00a33.20 - this does sound pricey but we had been to several others through the day and this was actually reasonably priced! We didn't eat in (although I have had a hot chocolate and chocolate tart from here before and can highly recommend - the cakes are quite pricey though). The dark chocolate truffle didn't really have much cocoa flavour, the peanut wafer chocolate was nice but again wasn't powerful enough, the salted caramel was good - rich and salty, and I can't remember the last one we got soooo can't have been all that good? Not a bad chocolate shop but seeing as this is what this place is meant to be all about I wasn't so impressed. I would recommend it more for an eat in cake and drink and head over to Paul A Youngs round the corner for some amazing (but very very expensive) chocolates.",

    "text": "As I write this, two days after my visit, I am still thinking about the hot chocolate. I am even considering if it would be too extravagant to plan a trip to the capital solely so I can visit Said again. This review is a little different to my usual reviews. \u00a0Usually, I like to build up a scene and give you, the reader, way too much information than you really need. But with this place, I felt I had to start with the main story of this review. \u00a0The scene setting can start now.....So, I spent a long weekend with my mum and step-dad. \u00a0On my route back up north, I had arranged to meet a friend after he finished work, and because I had bought a cheap ticket from the south coast, I had a few hours to kill in London. \u00a0Usually I would find a bar to sit in and have a glass or two of wine. \u00a0But since I am trying to cut down on my alcohol consumption, I needed another option. \u00a0As my train was approaching London Victoria, my mind wandered back to a conversation I had with a colleague from our London office a couple of months ago about hot chocolate. \u00a0More precisely, that our continental cousins seem to do a better job of a proper, chocolate-y hot chocolate than the British milk-y product. \u00a0My colleague told me about an Italian place in Soho which was, apparently, divine.It didn't take too much to find out the cafe and where it is. \u00a0I know my way around London so I found it fairly easily after my customary window shop around Bond Street. \u00a0I think if you're not familiar with Soho, you may find that you need a map, but it is pretty easy to find.When I arrived, it seemed fairly full, but being a loner, I found a spare seat at the end of a table, where the kind couple on the end said I could perch. \u00a0I chose the dark hot chocolate. And boy was my colleague correct on their description of this as 'divine'. It not often these words will leave my lips, but I am glad that I'm on am alcohol detox because otherwise I would not have come to this wonderful place. \u00a0As I said at the start of this review, I am still thinking of it. \u00a0Last night, I even had a dream that I bathed in it. That is pretty bad. To accompany the chocolate, I went for a raspberry cheesecake, as it sounded healthy. \u00a0Well, I was wrong, as nothing healthy tastes that good. It was a great accompaniment to the hot chocolate. \u00a0It was \u00a38.50 , which to my adopted-Northerner brain, seemed a lot but actually worth it for the pleasure gained. And what is life if you can't have utterly divine pleasure every now and again.They also sell products in their shop and on the shelf next to my table were jars upon jars of a chocolate sauce/spread. I regret not buying some, though if I had, I don't think it would have made it to Manchester. I can pretty much guarantee that I will be back here. \u00a0Even if I only have time for a quick visit. \u00a0I noticed that they do takeaway, which is great to note. \u00a0They also do coffee and tea but I'm not sure why anyone would ever go for anything other than the utterly divine hot chocolate.",

There were some people outside, we approached the door and one of the waitresses blocked our way in and put a cord across the door. Not a single word to explain what was happening or to acknowledge us. We stood there waiting thinking that it might be a few minutes to wait as it seemed quite busy and maybe they needed some time to clear the tables. Tables were cleared and people left and we were still kept waiting outside. We would have left already, but we had already been waiting for a while so we stayed. Finally we were let in and sat down. Waited for the menu and had to call the waitresses twice to ask them to take our orders. Eventually she came over and when we ordered hot chocolate she said they had run out. Seriously? You couldn't say that from the beginning? People come here for the hot chocolate and it doesn't cross your mind to tell that you have no hot chocolate? Funny enough the cups were adorned with chocolate poured down the side, which can only be hot chocolate... But they had run out. Poor managerial skills, poor customer service. Tiny table to fit two slices of cake (huge and tasty but also dry and not fresh) and two teas with their respective teapots.The whole cord blocking the entrance to create expectation is just pathetic and mean, keeping people waiting outside in winter for no reason, just to attract attention.",

We walked in and it was very crowded, we thought we would have to wait or order for take away, but one of the waiters was able to set up a table for us right by the window. The service is very quick. We ordered a blended coffee which was really just an expresso shaken with ice, a piece of carrot cake and a small hot chocolate. GET THE HOT CHOCOLATE! It was rim covered by white, milk and dark chocolate. If you've ever had hot chocolate in Italy then you may have a flashback! I've had hot chocolate very similar but never spot on like in Italy.... until now!! They have a TON of chocolates, if you're a chocolate lover then this is a must. I personally didn't care too much for the carrot cake, the filling was delicious but the cake part was not that great. The \"blended\" coffee was nothing special but very good if you like expresso, which I do. Not great for parties larger than 5, cute for a first date, dates, girl time, or small group meetups.",

For the cost of this about 5 pounds for a medium cup I would not get it again.. but this is just an FYI for all my Americans out there that might be expecting what I expected as well. The service here was great, the ambiance of it was amazing (European street-like), and they have a variety of pastries, coffee, and food as well. Just wasn't my cup of chocolate.",

One sip was delicious, two was too much, three was a definite mistake, and the fourth had us longing to get it up by any means necessary. Even the chocolate croissant, a simple and delicious pastry elsewhere, was covered in chocolate so that it over flowed the plate, making it sickeningly sweet and inedible after a bite or two. I get the novelty of it, but I don't understand why this place has return customers. The real problem was the manager/owner. She was rude to us, getting angry when we didn't understand what she was saying and we watched her yell at customers, forcing them to move tables after they had already settled. The shop was half empty so I can only assume she was saving the better table for someone else? She was abusive to the one server too, scolding him for inexplicable reasons and gesturing angrily from across the room. It was awkward and unpleasant to be around, especially as we tried to eek out our money's worth from pastry and drinks that none of us enjoyed. Happy to never return to this place!",

Small is \u00a32.50, with whip it's another 50p, and the chocolate layer, I believe is an additional \u00a31, for an eat-in price of \u00a34.80--not sure the sipping chocolate is worth that much, but it's definitely fun to see it served up so festive. Great for a dessert, it's so thick you have to eat it with a spoon and so rich it could even be shared with another person.The interior of the place is adorable, has a rustic feel with chocolate molds lining the side of the wall, confections like malt balls and chocolate covered almonds in large glass jars in the window, and a countertop decorated with cakes, brownies, and their handmade chocolates for sale at varying prices. Some they sell individually, others are purchased in increments of 100g. A great place to have a business meeting, a light lunch (there are sammies), an afternoon coffee, or an evening sweet treat. They are open late, which is convenient for those late night chocolate cravings.",

This was some of the best chocolate I have ever had! What an indulgence. The shop was adorable, but tiny. The chocolate though! Did I mention the chocolate? Superb!",

I came here on a weekday, maybe around 11, so it wasn't busy at all. There were multiple seating options and I sat at the end of a long table with a comfy bar seat. We ordered the hot chocolate and it was my first time to have hot chocolate like this! Thick! Creamy! Delicious! Beautiful! And the whipped cream came in a separate baby glass. Heheheh. Too cute.",

The hot chocolate was more like chocolate cake batter or brownie batter in that IT WAS SO THICK! I read a previous review that mentioned that you need a spoon to drink it and I thought they were exaggerating until I tried it myself and that's a very accurate statement! Too thick and too rich, I could only take a couple of sips before throwing it away.",

A break from breakfast in a chocolate shop (Italian) brought samples of dark chocolate, some with salt, some with hazelnut. Next \u00a0taste was a chocolate similar to Nutella but 100 times tastier. Yum! And finally a hot chocolate like I've never tasted. Once we finished our tour we back tracked to purchase chocolate to bring home.",
