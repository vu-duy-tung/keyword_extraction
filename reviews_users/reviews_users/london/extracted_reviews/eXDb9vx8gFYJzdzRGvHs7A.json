My friend had the garlic bread with cheese as his starter and that filled him up pretty quickly.It \u00a0was quiet busy and the staff were very friendly. The guy who served us got abit excited after my friend tipped him and his collegue ask 'how much they they tip you...'? 'nooo way dude' 'you share you share' lol",

Had the tomatoes pesto bread for appetizer and the Prawn Linguine and Chicken mushroom risotto .... the Linguine was pretty good and the risotto is AWESOME. The atmosphere was nice and very comtemporary and the staff are relatively friendly (in comparison to most other restaurant I have been to in London). And the price was really good ... with appetizer, main course and a wine, only \u00a315 per person ... cannot beat that.",

My main was a deliciously tender braised lamb shank, but I was too stuffed to have dessert but enjoyed a cup of good coffee to finish.Friendly and attentive service, in a clean environment. My neighbors had enjoyed their pizza from the wood burning oven located prominently as the centerpiece of the open space.A little pricier than your Olive Garbage (oh sorry, Olive Garden) but definitely worth it for the outstanding quality and service.",

But that in itself is testament to its winning formula of competently cooked pizzas (with extra points for rolling the dough in semolina, which gives their bases a crispier texture) and pasta dishes, excellent and friendly service and a pleasant decor. Most of all though I like the positive vibe exuded by the staff: unlike many other restaurants one gets the feeling that the staff here like their jobs and that there is a good 'team feeling' at this Zizzis. I'm almost willing to patronise this restaurant for this reason alone. Recommended.",

The restaurant was packed on arrival and we thought we may have difficulty getting a table but we were quickly shown to a very small table close to the VERY hot Pizza ovens!! Because it was so busy and almost every table was full it felt very claustraphobic and we were able to hear the fellow diners conversations with ease, infact at times our elbows were touching the next table. On a good note the service was both quick and professional and even though it was busy our meal arrived about 15 minutes after our order was taken. I ordered a Pasta meal and my partner ordered chicken, both were OK and for the price good value but they were a little tasteless and bland. The side dish of Garlic Bread topped with caramelised onion however was very tasty and a lovely addition to our meal. An ideal place for a quick pre-theatre meal or an after-work get together with friends or work collegues.",

Even though there were a couple of clean tables, we waited about ten minutes until we were seated at one by the window. (Which gave me a moment to visit the Men's room, which was clean.) Two regular chairs facing a two-seat sofa, it was uncomfortable and very low. If offered, take a table with regular chairs.An Italian restaurant, so the beer choice was of course Peroni, available in 330 or 600 ml bottles. I would have hoped to have other options, or even draft, but this was all. Lots and lots of wine was on display in massive back-lit shelves behind the bar.We started with the marinated olives and a plate of the garlic bread. Both were quite good, though I prefer my olives pitted before enjoying. The bread was topped with big pieces of roasted garlic, which set my appetite on high.My colleagues went with the Spaghetti Bolognese and the Mushroom Risotto. The Bolognese looked a little oily and rather a small portion. The Risotto was well enjoyed and very filling, so I was told. I decided on the Trentino pizza, which I thought needed a lot more cheese but it did have good flavor. I'm also not a big fan of the British practice of whole pies. Slicing it up with a knife and fork is a pain and entirely too much work.For dessert, I had the Torta Zizzi, a slice of tart with plum, almond, fig and pistachio. With a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream, absolutely heavenly. I was sorely tempted to lick the plate.We did a reasonable job of engaging our waitress and teasing her the entire evening. She put up with our hilarity and in doing so, earned a good tip. I would absolutely return.",

I wasn't expecting much - I recall a particularly stodgy and bland lasagne from the early noughties - but I really fancied a pizza and I was at work so my options were limited. We had an antipasti platter which featured some very delectable soft mozarella and delicious sun dried tomatoes. If I had to criticise I'd say it was a little pricey for what it was, but it was fresh and tasty. My pizza - fiorentina so as to get my 5 a day in - was huge and utterly delicious. I cou;dn't finish it but it wasn't for want of trying. Again everything tasted really fresh - and what they called 'bechamel' was good, though it was more like sour cream. In fact, I think it might have been sour cream. The boy had one of their new salads and I got food envy. Then we had some ice cream - absolutely tons of it - tough the pistachio was disappointly unpistachio-y. But that was the only bum note in what was actually an excellent meal for what I tend to assume is a mediocre restaurant chain. It certainly beats pizza express and the like, and I'll definitely visit again. Because of its location it gets extremely busy - it's not a place for a date.",

    "text": "Everything was delicious. After a week of pub food, we were grateful to sink our teeth into some bread and pasta... We sat outside on a beautiful patio in the middle of Victoria that wasn't overly crowded but just the right amount of foot traffic to keep my people watching in check... Since we decided to pre-game with some appetizers (and be really fat), we obviously went for the bread with not 1, not 2, but 3 different dipping options-- Garlic butter, Creamy pesto Rosso and Lemon & Rosemary aioli... How do you say no to any of those choices. They were all fabulous, but I think my favorite was the Garlic butter, obviously. We also opted for some calamari... so all health conscious options.For dinner, I had the Ravioli di Capra, which was SO good... It was made with goat cheese and spinach, served in a tomato sauce, topped with green pesto and pine nuts. Amazing!My little brother had a summer special pizza that had mozz, spianata piccante salami, red chillies, buffalo mozz, tomatoes, topped with lemon and herb salsa. His meal also kicked ass. All other meals around the table had zero leftovers ;) For dessert Brock and I shared our favorite, the classic Affogato-- gelato topped with an espresso shot... We obviously prefer slugging back a few espresso martinis but this was a close second. Great service as well! They had originally told us it would be about 45 minutes for food since they were working on a \u00a32000 order (holy crap!) and we barely waited 10 minutes from the time we ordered between courses. Now, come to America Zizzi!!",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with hanging meats and vegetables, different lighting and wood floors. The service was very friendly although our server was very busy running around. I had to ask multiple times for water. The wrong food was delivered to our table. All minor things that didn't really bother me. The wine was excellent. They have some great reds from Sicily. Be sure to try at least 1! The food was excellent. The crust on the pizza was perfect- chewy, but crispy. The buffalo mozzarella on the spaghetti pomodoro was the best part of the dish. \u00a0Everything was fairly priced. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

Our waiter arrived at our table after a while of us being seated and just simply stared at us, no hello or introduction of any kind. My husband and I ordered calamari (very basic dish to prepare) and it was completely flavorless including the sauce it was served with which tasted like mayonnaise from the jar. We then proceeded to order margarita pizza. Our lovely waiter brought it to us uncut so we had to slice it ourselves. He also didn't bring us any plates which was annoying. The pizza was ok, by that I mean if there is a fast food pizza chain such as Pizza Hut that would have probably tasted so much better. I over heard the waiter tell another customer the chef was Italian. What a damn shame.",

I ordered the Penne Della Casa, which is a penne with chicken and creamy mushroom sauce, which had absolutely NO FLAVOR. I had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to make it taste somewhat decent.The service was subpar - our waitress at first was pretty friendly but then she disappeared for our entire meal and no one came to check up on us at all. My boyfriend asked another waiter for some more water and it never came until we asked again. And when we asked again, the waiter had attitude and was like \"I'm bringing it to you now!\" I definitely would not return to this establishment as the service and food weren't great.

It was packed on the inside as well as in their outside seating, where we waited just a few minutes to be seated. I loved the outside seating because of the view of Westminster Cathedral across the street at sunset. We ordered cheesy garlic bread & calamari as appetizers and a ravioli di capra dish and lasagna dish for our meals. The food was wonderful though it took some time to come out, likely because of the number of people being served. The Peroni wasn't very cold, neither were the waters we asked for. We figured that may be a British custom, so we didn't think anything of it. All in all the place was wonderful. Great food, great relaxed ambiance and wonderful energy, and that's all I can ask for. I'd certainly visit again.Visited July 2013",
