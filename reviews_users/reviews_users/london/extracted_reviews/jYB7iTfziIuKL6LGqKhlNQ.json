    "text": "i am really no expert on mexican food. i try again and again to like it, but mostly it just leaves me underwhelmed. i guess it's cos i like margaritas so much that i keep on trying, but maybe it is time for me to give up! (i will never give up on margaritas though...)accidentally came here on cinco de mayo (i have accidentally ended up eating mexican every cinco de mayo for the last four years, honestly don't know how i have done that!) with my boyfriend. i ordered the margarita of the month, which was a pineapple type affair. it was good, but small, and didn't taste particually potent. my next one was the classic margarita to gauge exactly how good they are - it was really sweet, not the best, and at \u00a37.70 each, not cheap either.the food we got was good, but not mindblowing, and when the bill came, i was kinda disappointed that we had came and spent that money on food that wasn't amazing. we each ordered the pescado tacos, and i had the camarones (garlicky prawns and avocado), and my boyfriend some chorizo and cheese type taco. he's more into mexican food than i am, and even he was pretty underwhelmed.even though there seemed to be a lot of wait staff for a pretty small room, they were a tad inefficient. i had to ask twice for tap water, and they took forever clearing my first margarita glass, and then the plates from the table. i didn't think the atmosphere was amazing either.i was going to give this place 3 stars, but then reading back on my review it seems that there really isn't that much i actually enjoyed about it...so personally i wouldn't go again, but then mexican isn't really my thing. it may be yours and this place might work out better for you!",

I even got to indulge in a fish taco with my very excited friend Lizzie. I have been told on good faith by my knowledgeable America bud Laura, that this is the most authentic Mexican food we have tried so far in London.The prices seemed reasonable, the service sketchy, and the atmosphere pretty non-existent, but the food was highly enjoyable if not quite making the mark of excellence.Oh yeah... If you are a tequila fan, you definitely need to go. They have a fabulous selection Jalisco goodness.",

Everything I've tasted here has been good, probably because the kitchen seems to be staffed with Mexican cooks. Strangely, though, most of the wait staff seem to be from Spain.The only \"corn tortillas\" usually available in grocery stores in London are gummy wheat flour-corn meal melanges so I was very excited to find out that I could buy some of Taqueria's genuine corn tortillas to take home for all my enchilada-making needs. Speaking of enchiladas, Taqueria also sells big bags of New Mexico chilies if you are inclined to make your own enchilada sauce.",

    "text": "There are two possibilities: 1) my expectations for Mexican food in London are so low that any place that is halfway good will make me happy, or 2) Taqueria has genuine potential. I got chicken enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce and a side of refried black beans. The chicken inside my enchiladas was not as flavorful as I would have liked, and the cheese on top -- which their menu promised as \"queso fresco\" -- was totally fine, but definitely not queso fresco. The beans were okay, but both the beans and enchiladas were screaming for a lot of salt.The tomatillo sauce, however, was wonderful -- very similar to the stuff I grew up on in Arizona and California. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. At one point, I was trying to ask if the beans were cooked in lard and I could see that the waitress didn't understand me, so I asked if she spoke Spanish. She did, we switched over to Spanish, talked about the beans (no lard!), and she continued to speak to me in Spanish for the rest of the meal. It made me feel very comfortable and at home :-) I would definitely give Taqueria a second shot, especially because good Mexican food in London is so woefully unavailable. There was enough promise in that tomatillo sauce to make me think there might be some other little gems on that menu!",

I can prove that the place is legit, corn tortillas tasted like the ones at home; the only thing is the portions are too small, and if you know how much a taco really cost in Mexico like me, you'd think you are eating tacos filled with caviar.

It's sort of a Mexican Tapas bar, complete with Spanish music and ambiance. The Cerviche is wonderful and so is the pork taco with a citrus kick. If you get one of the small plates, it's a snack. Two of the smaller plates, a meal. One big plate 3/4 of a meal. This place is a great deal. They give you the sunflower seeds with spice no matter what you order and do a guacamole with a consistency to die for,",

    "text": "So maybe I have been in London too long because I know that I am probably being more forgiving than I normally would about a Mexican food place, but I thought this place was REALLY good for London. Maybe I don't remember what \"real\" Mexican food is like, but the second I walked in the front door the smells let me know that I was in the right place.This is not your \"dirty mexican\" sold at a drive through joint at 2 am like I know all of us Californians are craving, but it was more like one of those lil taco restaurants that you have to sit down in and eat like a human being, not a drunk/hungover mess of amazingness. This includes small portions, the plates usually consist of 2 or 3 tacos, so we had to get a few sides. which included refried and \"the other kind\" of beans that AREN'T refried. But for me, one of the biggest differences was the chips! I don't mean fries you brits! i mean tortilla chips! they weren't those fake, grainy corn chips that you can get at sainsburys for 25 p for a bag. these were those smooth oily chips made from something that once resembled a tortilla. and they had REAL mexican ingredients! things on the Menu that reminded me of a distant time when i used to eat mexican every day. things that have become forgotten from my dialect because I stopped saying them. like Jamaica, or totopos (not potatoes).I got camarones al ajillo, but someone at the table next to me ordered a fish taco, and i wanted to eat theirs too... so we got plantains and an extra avocado and it was HEAVENLY.I heard that they make their own tortillas at the restaurant and it really makes a difference.I will definitely be going back. Preferably on a thursday, b/c they have margarita specials for \u00a32 off the reg price. and next time I am getting the Fish taco and the Tortilla soup. don't even TRY to talk me out of it. ok?

When I first saw this film after peeing in my pants while giggling to \"I seend it, I seend it!\" the Fish Tacos quote had me on the floor holding my sides. What was this crazy person talking about putting fish in a taco. Anyway, when I was informed that this was actually a proper traditional Mexican thing I just had to hunt it out and try it.Laura N thank you for taking me here and thank you for pointing this out on the menu, with it being in Spanish i would have passed over this without a second glance. And what was so great about this is that when it arrived I really like it. Like a fish finger wrap only better because they called it a Fish Taco.Now this place could be a top eating spot for me, the only problem was that it was a week night and pretty early and the place was so empty that it lacked a little atmosphere. Lovely food though, and awesome cocktails. I don't know if I mentioned it but the Fish Tacos are pretty friggin' awesome to.Ha ha ha, Fish Tacos!",

(Just the fact that they don't use some overly sugared marg-mix is a step up from the closest competition.) These were both very very very good signs! However the tacos were a bit off and exorbitantly expensive. The ingredients were there -- corn tortillas, fresh chilies, dried herbs, black beans -- but the sour cream and salsa were disappointing at best, and stand-ins for mayo and ketchup at worst. The atmosphere was far too sterile and service (other than the fantastic manager who originally sat us) was non-existent. \u00a0However I will give some bonus points for hearing Spanish being spoken by all the servers as well as the kitchen staff, which again, is a huge step above the closest competition. Seriously, at least one star was given from hearing the correct pronunciation of \"Taaah-co\" vs. \"TacK-o.\" So the search continues...",

With that out of the way, let's get to the real review.I don't have Gwynnie's kind of dividends, so no... I wouldn't necessarily return to Taqueria if I was after some delicious tacos. I couldn't justify the cost.It is a beautiful restaurant though and the window seats are perfect for people watching. All those beautiful Westbourne Grove folks in their designer clothes. I LOVE IT THERE.Suzanne H and I took full advantage of their margarita madness - it was a very nice take on the beverage, served in a martini glass with a salted rim. Classy.Something else that caught my eye was the giant selection of special spices and chilis to buy. They even have bags of handmade tortillas for sale. That's nice - you can't find this stuff very easily in London.Fried plantains = best part of the meal.",

The service wasn't bad, but the food was just not what I heard it was and definitely didn't meet even a minuscule degree of quality Mexican food. I've had better carne asada tacos made by some guy on a hibachi in the trunk of his car in TJ (Tiajuana). Again, the food wasn't bad, it was just disappointing. And by disappointing, I mean disappointing in the way when your parents have that talk with you and say they aren't mad you stole the car and crashed it, they are just disappointed in you; which is WAY worse. Plus side of this smallish little restaurant in the Notting Hill Gate area is their selection of Mexican beers and tequila. They had some good choices, not plentiful, but good. I savored Pacifico and enjoyed several. One thing you don't really see in many Mexican places in Mexico or the States is they offer you your beer \"chilada\" style, which is served in a glass with lime juice (not a lime), salt on the rim and ice. Okay, I get it. I like Margaritas too, but I don't want the equivalent of a beer margarita. I want my lovely Pacifico sans glass with a slice of lime in it. Done. Simple, easy, clean, tasty. Also, this place does take reservations, just not on the weekends. Get there before 8:30pm or it begins to queue up.",

I can't pin point exactly why they miss the mark but perhaps it's that entrees in the US are served with a side of rice and beans. Perhaps it's the salsa, perhaps the tortillas. All of which were excellent at Taqueria, but not the same. I guess some things just can't be replicated. New Yorkers will say the same thing about bagels (its the water). They have a little business selling their own chips and jarred salsas with a lovely display on one wall. Anyway, lovely little place and ironically, after dinner, a walk down the street revealed two more Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood.

    "text": "This is a rating for a London Mexican food. :-)There are a number of Mexican places that have popped up in London to try to offer good Mexican food, and this place does well. It is somehow missing some sort of spiciness, roughness or earthiness that I tend to like in a taco, but you are in Notting Hill.The tacos Al Pastor were okay, but the sauce is not quite correct from what I'm used to. The chicken Tinga tacos were not a flavor I was familiar with, though they seemed a bit bland.The two standouts were the baked cheese appetizer and the Puntas Alba\u00f1il, which was sort of like a fajita in a taco. With the hot sauce, these were great.This is pretty close to where I live, so there's a good chance I'll be back the next time the taco craving hits.Gluten-free notes: Their corn tortillas are just corn. They're happy to tell you what does or doesn't have wheat, and mark a few wheaty items on the menu. Beware of one beer-batter-fried taco filling.",

The ratio of tasty filling to tortilla ratio is perfect. My favourites tacos are Vampiro and Huaraches (although I note that they've stopped using blue corn and are just using regular white or yellow corn for the slipper tortilla -- bring back the blue!!) but they're all very good.The margaritas are also not half bad!Service is variable (unsurprisingly correlated to to the presence of the manager) hence the four stars.

Immediately after receiving our food, she immediately asked \"Is there something wrong with your food?\" out of nowhere, leaving us all uncomfortable and speechless. The table was constantly being cleared without even being asked if we were finished with the remainder of the food or our drinks (clearing the glasses with a significant amount of alcohol left in the glass). After all of this, the waitress put the bill on the table without our request for any bill. This was ignored, as we continued to finish our drinks, only to have the waitress return with a card machine asking us how we wish to pay (AS IF WE WERE AT AN APPLEBEES IN MIDDLE AMERICA). Because of this, my experience was completely thrown off and constantly interrupted. Very disappointed in this waitresses' lack of table etiquette at an actually very potentially enjoyable restaurant. Disappointing.",

I was hugely impressed that Taqueria is a member of the SRA (Sustainable Restaurant Association) and actively do their best to reduce energy consumption in the restaurant, and support sustainable fishing. Also, they only use free range eggs, chicken and pork. The carnitas were out of this world. The margaritas were strong (and pricey) and well made. The Camarones al mojo de ajo were fantastic. Definitely order a couple of dishes each off the menu, the portions weren't too big and it's worth it to be a little greedy.The service was sweet and helpful, but a little slow. We didn't get much attention after we'd finished our meal and were waiting for a dessert menu. Not bad at all, just not perfect. I will definitely be going back!",

I have no idea really how authentic it all is but at least 10% of the menu is written in Spanish - a good sign - and they serve up really good Margaritas to go with them - a very good sign. It's got a little bit of an American diner style, with quite a bit of chrome and a big glass front window. When I was there the staff were mostly Mexican - another good sign - and the food was really nice. There were four of us so we ordered lots of different little dishes to share which seems to be the best option, frijoles, enchilidas, tacos obviously: they have a really good mix.

The night we went (a group of about 10 of us), it was packed despite being a Thursday night.The food that we received was good, fresh, tasty but it was not cheap. Ok, it's Notting Hill, I can let that slide. My one big criticism is that the tortillas they serve the food in are just ok - certainly not the best and it wouldn't hurt if they were warm. The margaritas (I think \u00a36?) were pretty good.What really let this place down was the service. We were 10 people - that's not a huge table and shouldn't be a problem for waitstaff (speaking as a 3 year veteran of the field). One of my friends waited 45 minutes for fish tacos only to be told that it wasn't ordered (which involved the waitstaff showing us that the only fish taco that had been ordered was delivered to the table because it was checked off their list...ok?). I had to ask 3 times (over 25 minutes) for some tap water to go along with my margaritas (margaritas served promptly, tap water not). This was particularly frustrating given that a lot of the waitstaff was standing around while we weren't getting what we needed.All in all, I wouldn't suggest this place for meeting up (I didn't feel that safe on the walk from Notting Hill Gate but that's my issue!) but I wouldn't refuse if others wanted to go here. I would be prepared to spend quite a bit and wait, though!",

The tacos and enchiladas served there are proper tacos and enchiladas / not just some tacos crisps served with mediocre salsa and basics) - proper small round tortillas with a variety of delicious warm fillings including pork, beef and many more in a combination with amazing flavours. This place serves authentic Mexican drinks and is usually quite busy.The decor is slightly overlooked but despite this.. It's the first place that comes to my mind when I think 'proper authentic, delicious Mexican food' :) outside Mexico.",

    "text": "This has been my best Mexican restaurant experience yet, and it's been a long, long search. The food was absolutely delicious. I judge a Mexican restaurant on the quality of its rice and its guacamole and both were top notch. I also really enjoyed the fried plantains, which aren't served in many Mexican restaurants surprisingly enough.The portions here are not huge, but still I think it's reasonably priced. I had the carne asada tacos (which came as two 'large' tacos) and the arroz mexicana with plantains. I found this to be sufficient. I felt full but not stuffed. The margaritas are also nice and strong... can't go wrong with that!In my experience, the service was standard. We had no complaints. It was fairly easy to get the waitress's attention and they were nice and friendly. Also, at 7pm on a Saturday night, it was fairly easy to get a table for 3 (there were about 2 or 3 open at the time). Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This isn't simply one of those \"it's good Mexican food...for London\" type of places. \u00a0This is simply GREAT Mexican food. \u00a0And not Cali-Mex or Tex-Mex food - real authentic Mexican food. \u00a0The name would suggest that it's the type of place that serves quesadilla suizas, has a jukebox and Chivas de Guadalajara posters on the wall, but it's not. \u00a0This is really high-end Mexican comfort food.For a gringo, I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob. \u00a0I lived in San Francisco's predominantly-Mexican Mission District for 12 years, I studied Spanish in Guanajuato for a month, I got engaged in Guanajuato, I got married in Puerto Vallarta, and I've been to Mexico at least half a dozen other times. \u00a0I don't claim to be an expert on Mexican food, but I will say that this place is as good as any Mexican restaurant I've ever been to - including places in Mexico.Ok, maybe it's because I've been in London for 2 months and this is only the second time I've tried Mexican food here, the first being some bizarre Mexican-Italian place in Chelsea that we were satisfied with simply because it didn't completely suck. \u00a0Taqueria not only doesn't suck, it's the complete opposite of suck. \u00a0They have tacos al pastor garnished with pineapple - that wins huge points for authenticity right there. They make delicious and fresh chilitos rellenos. \u00a0They serve churros con cajeta. \u00a0That's right - they have cajeta.And what Mexican meal would be complete without drinks? \u00a0They have Pacifico, Negra Modelo, Bohemia, Dos Equis Lager AND Amber, plus they make both cheladas and micheladas. \u00a0Really good cheladas. \u00a0Their tequila selection is outstanding, and if that wasn't enough, Corralejo Reposado (the one in the tall blue bottle) is their default top-shelf tequila for fancy margaritas. \u00a0I freaking love Corralejo Reposado.I'm going to find it very difficult to not eat here at least once a week. \u00a0I can't wait to go back just to get a poloma and the pozole.Plus it's decently priced. \u00a0We splurged on 4 drinks, 3 orders of tacos, 2 appetizers and 2 desserts and the bill came to a relatively reasonable \u00a354 with tip. \u00a0That's obviously not cheap, but I've spent at least that much on far lesser Mexican meals at restaurants of this caliber in San Francisco. \u00a0If you were more price-conscious then you could still easily get out of here for \u00a315-20/person including a (really good) drink and tip.",

    "text": "For Mexican food in London, this place is pretty good, and closer to authentic Mexican then other places I have tried in the city. But my amigos, it needs a dash more chile, and much more tequila. I am not trying to be a taco snob here, but when Mexican is done right, it is AMAZING! You have not lived until you have had proper tacos al pastor. Spiced pork cooked on a rotisserie like a shwarma, with spicy seasonings. It is then cut in small slices right off the rotisserie as it cooks, and the meat put into tortillas with pineapple chunks, chopped onion and cilantro to taste. It is soft and crunchy at the same time and one of life's great culinary delights. So with this craving I went to Taqueria and yes, it wasn't what I expected. I think these were beef instead of pork and sauce was added to make it seem like the real thing, but it missed the mark. In saying that, for London Mexican, it was pretty darn good, and the place had a fun cantina feel. The other tacos I tried were tasty as were the quesadillas. I would definitely go back. Colorful and festive, a bright spot on a rainy day.",

    "text": "Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Luckily, my group wasn't the good people whom bad things happened to when we went to Taqueria, but the group whose table we were given were pretty pissed by the whole thing and ended up leaving. The confusion in a reservation that left two large parties and only one large table could have gotten quite nasty -- after all, having some lady come up and accuse you of stealing her table, when you came in on time and were seated by the hostess, can generally leave one feeling as though they have a right to the table they are at. The restaurant did their best to diffuse the situation, though of course not everyone could be pleased. I will say that it was good luck for the restaurant that they didn't kick us out, as our party kept growing, spending, and little did they know that both Tequila Tuesday and a Yelper were at the table. That can go really poorly if you put those people out of the restaurant, especially when they were timely and indulgent patrons.There are other things though, that unfortunately weren't perfect. My friend is gluten free, and if you can believe it, they have no corn tortilla dishes. EVERYTHING has flour, except for the tortilla chips, which she was forced to have for dinner. That's just disappointing, especially since so many restaurants know how many people can't eat gluten, and so many Mexican restaurants are realizing the value of corn tortilla both in taste and customer satisfaction.Additionally, they were a bit overwhelmed by us, despite having planned on a big party. Dishes came out quite haphazardly and we spent a lot of time trying to figure out who ordered what and where, etc. In the end, the drinks were great, and the food tasty, and it all worked out, but it's still tough when it's not a strong performance for the serving staff. Nonetheless, as Tequila Tuesdays go, it's definitely not the worst I've had. A solid middle score restaurant, I'd say.",

A fried oyster that took several bites with a yummy sauce went down easy. The cheesy grilled corn was a delight.Then came the giant tacos. These are no tiny Mexican street tacos, they are super sized. For the price they needed to be but worth every pence! The pork belly was thick cut and tender, great bbq sauce and crunchy sweet potato topping. The fish tacos took it to a new level. Creamy sauce atop perfectly cooked fish with cabbage.

    "text": "Just home from this place.The good:- the carnitas tacos. they were really delicious. some of the best I've had in Europe (which isn't a high bar, but still...)The bad:- portion sizes. I agree with the chica who said \"tacos come with two tortillas and give me three, not two\"- the chips - they were staleThe ugly - the bartender. We had our meal at the bar because the tables were full. The guy was way more concerned with trying to seduce female waitstaff than with helping customers. \u00a0We ordered wine, which apparently was our first mistake. This guy clearly love to do his little shaker dance when making cocktails, and we outrageously deprived him of that opportunity. He also gave my boyfriend a totally machismo and condescending look as if to say, \"real men don't order wine.\" Then he proceeded to bring me the wrong wine (red instead of white) and when I pointed it out, he blamed me for saying it wrong, when in fact I had read it directly from the menu. (And as you can see from the volume of (mostly positive) yelp reviews I've done, it wasn't my first wine ordering rodeo. When I pointed on the menu to the wine I had correctly ordered, and highlighted the fact that it was in the \"white wine column\" he said nothing and disdainfully replaced the wine, and any chance we had at having a positive experience was over. He then ignored us until our dinner was over (someone else brought the tacos). When I noticed that there was a discretionary service charge included in the bill, I asked to have it removed. This is something I never do. As a generously tipping Californian, I always leave at least 15%, even for bad service. Something about this guy just really got under my skin, so I asked to have the discretionary tip removed. I paid the bill in cash and asked for change back, he proceeded to give me 8 dollars change, in change, after slamming some things around and taking his sweet time and claiming they only had tens. He really ruined the dinner for us.No bueno!",

First thing you notice when you walk in is the very grilly grill smell. And just so you know that smell will follow you home as well. Other than that all good by the look of the place and the waiters welcomed us politely and with a smile. All the waitors also spoke both english and spanish which was very cool in my opinion. I ordered 2 scallops, a ceviche and a fish taco. They were actually all very tasty and I got my tummy full but I wasn't very hungry to start with. So the portions were quite small especially for the prices. The two scallops set me back like 3,5 pounds, the ceviche was 7,5 and the fish taco was like 6. So a little bit pricy if you want to eat a lot. Also I couldn't resist the churros for dessert as the lovely waitress gave them such high praise and she was totally right - they were divine. For a drink I had a nice Mexican bottled beer (which was brought in a chilled glass and was heavenly). So if you don't mind smelling like a grill and overpaying a little bit for your meal then I recommend Taquer\u00eda, because it was definitely delicious and a nice visit overall.",

I am originally from California and my parents live in Arizona which both border Mexico so I know a little about proper Mexican food. Sorry to say but most \"Mexican\" places in London just don't cut it.Here they serve authentic tacos and other fabulous creations. I always order the carne asada tacos, the marinated pork tacos with pineapple, and the classic margaritas. The meat is always fresh and they use proper corn tortillas. The plantains are also fantastic and are served slightly squishy not fried hard which personally I prefer. Whenever I leave here I am happily stuffed and satisfied.All the drinks here are very good. They are strong and not overly sweet with syrups and other artificial sweetners. Just good old fashioned mixed drinks. They also have a decent beer selection.The prices are very decent for what you get and especially for this part of town. It's usually pretty busy but even without a reservation I have never waited too long to be seated and served. The ambiance isn't exactly date night worthy, you won't find table cloths and dimmed lighting here. But you will find amazing food that gets everyone talking. Its great for groups since the portions are small everyone can get something different and try everything together.I should also mention they sell tortillas, spices and cheese!!!",

None of them were mind blowing in their filling selection but still better than a Wahaca or some other chain. We ordered up a starter of guac and chips and ceviche. The ceviche was small as London usually serves it but very fresh, sharp and delicious. We ordered a fish tacos and a pork carnitas as well. The fish tacos were fantastically moreish, with the right amount of crispyness and saucy. My favourite. The pork was a bit uninspired for me and not very visually appealing either, so I let my boyfriend finish the whole plate. We had a great meal here. It's not cheap as each tacos plate is about \u00a37-8 so you will end up spending. Pretty ironic as Mexican should be a cheap food. I'd definitely go back if I was in the area.",

Simple, Mexican rather than American Tex Mex. The drinks seem to be where they make their margins so order with care. Its something about the location, decoration and nice waiters that have me returning there. I like the carnitas, the avocado with sweet onion salt and coriander, the black beans with cheese. On a sour note, last time I went there for lunch on the weekend, they had employed a new manager, a pint sized young woman, who strutted around with a clip-board the whole time and did nothing to alleviate the busy waiters (because, you know, she is the manager...!) She kept dissuading people from staying by saying they would have to wait over an hour. It turned out to be more like 20 minutes! Why are they paying this little person a salary exactly?",

I recommend at least two plates of tacos per person if you have a good appetite. The best thing is to go with a group of friends so you can order many different dishes and try them all. The only thing I would say is that it can get a bit busy (and noisy) in the evenings, so if you want a quiet meal, come here at lunchtime instead.",

Attached to it, it is worth noting, is a deli with a good assortment of chilies to buy, and I certainly grabbed a few on my way out! Taqueria, like most if not all Mexicans in London, will not satisfy those of you (like me) who have a bit of American in them and are out seeking that TexMex style hard shell taco, but if you like the tacos at Wahaca, then this place is for you. To sum it up, indeed, it's like Wahaca but has just the taco part of the menu, and a much more extensive one at that. And the decoration and atmosphere are much more like a small deli than Wahaca's bustle. It serves good softshell tacos, made with quality ingredients, and each table has a bottle of hot sauce to help you spice it up to your personal taste nirvana. Still, I had 3 tacos and it came to 25 pounds so it's hardly the cheapest place to hit if you are truly hungry.",

    "text": "Gringos who love Mexican food split into two factions: those who love the small el DF-style corn tortillas and those who love the large, flour tortillas of Tex-Mex. I belong to the former camp, and the only place in London that comes close to satisfying my cravings for soft corn tacos filled with prawns, fish, bistec, carne asada, carnitas, you name it, is Taqueria in Notting Hill. The corn meal is a different variety from the kind you find in Mexico, and the tacos al pastor don't match the savoury sweet-tart kick of El Tizoncito in Mexico City, but this place (along with the El Azteca Mexican food store in Elephant & Castle, which delivers!) has some of the best, freshest tortillas in London. Taqueria offers a good range of seafood/meat tacos with a good balance of chopped onions and cilantro. If you are feeling desperate for real flavour after having tried the mildy spicy ready meals at Tesco and Sainsbury, go to Taqueria; squeeze some lime; and pour on the hot sauce. I also recommend getting the flor de jamaica or watermelon juice with your tacos. There is a fair selection of non-taco dishes as well, but if you want moles or other more complex dishes, my Mexican friends prefer Mestizo. The bill at Taqueria will run between \u00a325 to \u00a335 per person, including a couple of drinks.",

Try haveing a soup as a starter then a couple of tacos and you will be full. Not keen on the side salad as it is just iceberg lettuce with a few cucmbers, go for the corn which has melted cheese on it....delicious. Can't wait to go back.",
