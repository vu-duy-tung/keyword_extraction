At the moment that is a happy relationship - perhaps I will update later. I use Barrafina as the benchmark for any Spanish tapas joint in London. I think I have just found Barrafina's very good looking twin sister. The portions of Jabugo ham were very healthy, or perhaps not that healthy for my waistline. The rioja that I used to wash down the dried porcine was very accessible and reasonably priced - it didn't have that dangerous edge that other cheaper Riojas can have. Croquettas were so good they would make any Spanish grandmother cry. Fried white bait - yum! So, I am going to alternate between here and Barrafina - I like both so much. Viva my intestines!",

    "text": "We went there recently for a work-related dinner with a very diverse group of people. The great thing about tapas is that there is something in it for everyone. I like it because it's a very social way of eating and sharing food, and that also worked out at our dinner. The food at Iberica was delicious and the service excellent. Since we were a larger group, we had made a reservation in advance and settled on one of the menus. That was a good choice, and we were not disappointed by the never-ending stream of dishes that arrrived at our table. My personal favourites were the potato omelette (\"Spanish Omelette with onions\") and the tuna-pepper cakes (\"Roasted Piquillos with bonito tuna and caramelized onions\"), but others obviously had a different taste. I was not so much convinced by the desserts (almond sponge with chocolate mousse and berries, caramelized spanish rice pudding), but again, that will be very much up to your own taste and expectations. Given the central location, it is definitely a bit more on the pricey side. However, we had a great evening and would certainly come again.",

Spanish restaurant and cultural centre, Iberica (195 Great Portland Street, W1W 5PS), has recently launched a new mini desgustacion menu available Monday through Saturday from noon to 3pm. Served only at the bar (and a long, lovely bar at that), this mini desgustacion menu is an attractive arrangement of hot and cold (and deliciously innovative) tapas served with a crisp cold glass of Tio Pepe. At \u00a316 and promised to be under your chin within 10 to 15 minutes of ordering, it's the best culinary representation in London of what's gorgeous and current (without being all molecular and chi-chi) about modern Spanish cooking.I can only imagine the rest of the menu is awesome here as well. I am dying to go back and to share this marvel with my foodie friends. Just wonderful. Why aren't I there right now?",

    "text": "I have just returned from a wonderful trip in Europe that included cuisine from Amsterdam, Paris and London. So imagine my surprise when my absolute favourite place we ate on this entire trip turned out to be a Spainish tapas restaurant in London!  \u00a0My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a recommendation from a friend we had made on the euroStar and we had some high expectations to fill because we came hungry and full of hopes. And Iberica overdelivered! We liked it so much that we made a reservation for the following Saturday for dinner and neither experience left anything to be desired! \u00a0Firstly, the service is wonderful! It was some of the best we had are whole trip - everyone was so warm and helpful and made some wonderful recommendations for food and wine. I really appreciate a good server, because I realize it can be a tough industry to work in and it's always nice to feel wecome when eating a meal. Iberica goes a step beyond and makes you feel like you are dining with old friends. Secondly, the ambiance is fresh and open. It doubles as a delicatessan (you mean I can bring the wine HOME WITH ME -YAY!!), but manages to maintain a feeling of quiet elegance, refreshment and warmth. Thirdly, the Price: Our whole meal for dinner (for two) was about 80 euro or so, to me this was a fantastic bargain to eat so well, but I'll let you be the judge. Now, onto the food and beverages! Beverages:Being a fan of Mocastel, I decided to have a glass and right away our server made a fantastic recommendation that was sweet, complex and went well with our meal. They also gave us a complimentary hazelnut liquor with our dessert that was just phenomenal (extra perks b/c it was free - I don't know who liked us so much, but thank you!)! As we were doing a lot of walking on this trip we decided not to sample from their excellent wine list, but the selection looked fabulous and our lunch mates one table over made several nice comments about the Mencia they had ordered.Lunch: \u00a0 For lunch we had olive, bread & olive oil (so good, it came out fresh and still warm!), the traditional Spanish omlette (the texture of this dish alone would send me back), seared monkfish, pork belly with new potatoes, and a salad to share. \u00a0Everything was sensational and we decided to make a dinner reservation immediately following our lunch because it was so tasty.Later that week... Our dinner fare included:Half & Half which gave us a lovely selection of cured Iberico jamon serrano, chorizo and pork loin and three different cheeses with quince and an fruit spread which was delicious! \u00a0Bread & olive oil - still delicious and helpful with sauces, but unfortunately the olive oil fell to the wayside the more food was bestowed upon us!Fried artichokes with pear aioli & the Iberica ham croquettes - two of the highlights of the meal for meSeared scallops on a bed of cauliflower puree - this is a favourite dish of my EXTREMELY picky boyfriend and he loved it so much I thought I might not even get to sample this exquisite dish!Segovian lamb chops - which were succulant and full of flavours!The suckling pig (small order) - by the time this dish was ready I was in a happy little food coma, so I just remember moaning a lot and tasting something wonderful in my mouth. Boyfriend claims the pig was \"juicy, but I just want more of those scallops!\"For dessert (which we almost didn't order because we were SO full by the end of this glorious meal!) we got the whiskey cake which knocked out socks off!  \u00a0 \u00a0I went to Spain on an excursion two years ago and eating at Iberica magically transported me back. I loved eating amongst other happy diners and, for me, to have such a grand meal at a relaxed pace with good conversation is one of the best things in life. My only regret is that I don't live in London (preferrably in the same flat as Laura N.), so I can go back again and again!",

I wanted to go in but never did until recently when I organised a night out with the girls.On arrival at 7pm on a Sat night, it was really quiet. I was worried that there won't be any ambience on a Sat night as I've been looking forward to going to Iberica for a very long time. However by 8pm, there were a crowd of people and the restaurant was buzzing! So it was a bit difficult to get the waiter's attention as they were busy running around, trying to serve different tables at a time. So the service was a bit slow. As there were many of us, we tried various many dishes and I can safely say that their suckling pig, the ham croquettes, fried chorizo lollipops and the black rice cuttlefish were one of my fav dishes. Thinking about it is making me so hungry! \u00a0But the only dish that I wouldn't want to order again is the slow stewed cockerel rice as the taste was way too strong for my liking!This is one of my fav Spanish restaurant in London as I have had many bad experiences... so I would recommend this place if you fancy some delicious mouth watering tapas and if you have the money to splash on pay day, this is your place to go! ;)",

    "text": "For two days, we passed by, peering in at their sleek, modern decor. The bar was packed and the tables along the windows filled with women in stilettos, silky tops and skinny jeans and men in crisp dress shirts and gold chain necklaces. Before the theater one night, we ventured in. It was early and we had our choice of window tables. Tapas, we agreed, was a delicious way to sample a lot of dishes. Sure, you sometimes hit a pothole, a clunker, but we agreed, it's a relatively safe way to tour a menu. A perfectly salty trio of olives kick started our adventure followed by a platter of succulent hams and cheeses on a wood board. And then along came their \"Ensaladilla,\" potato, tuna and vegetable salad. Warning! Detour! Watery mayonnaise dressing with no flavor. Quickly though, we got back on track with their slow stewed beef with red wine that melted in our mouths. And the fried chorizo lollypops with pear aioli? Inventive and memorable. And then a plate of prawns arrived. Prepared in their shells, they appeared photo worthy. Each of us took a bite and instantly cast our votes: \"Mushy.\"\"Old!\" \"I hope I don't get sick!\" After the waiter returned with our credit card, he asked about our meal. \u00a0I gave him a quick rundown of our faves as well as the watery salad and inedible prawns.\"Really?\" he said.\"They're not good. Not fresh. I think the chef should be told.\"\"Sorry,\" he said. \"Have a nice evening.\"Looking back, the salad was just a bump in a good meal but the prawns? They're like the flat tire no one ever expects nor forgets.",

    "text": "We called same day to inquire about the paella and make a reservation. Online it said they needed a 12 hour in advance notice in order to prepare it on a weekday, but over the phone the staff said that they could do it no problem. The only thing was that they couldn't offer us the seafood & chicken paella but instead said they could offer seafood paella and a separate order of the slow stewed chicken and rice. We thought this was somewhat odd, but decided to schedule the reservation anyways. Once we arrived, we were informed at the door that we were only able to sit at our table for 2 hours. This also sounded somewhat odd and also slightly rude, but at this point we were already there, meeting a friend, and had placed our order for paella and the chicken and rice, so we stayed.:: Onto the food & drinks ::Tapas: Best thing here and honestly very good. We had the fried chorizo lollipops which were pretty delicious. As well, we ordered the Corn torto fritter with Cabrales cheese egg scramble. It was also surprisingly good. Sangria: Over the course of the evening we ordered both the red and white sangria. They were both tasty but mediocre at best.Paella: This is where the low rating comes in. The Seafood paella was made up of only prawns and very small diced up squid (which several of us had originally mistaken for corn). It was pretty pathetic. Not a single clam, mussel, lobster, etc. It was honestly just prawn paella and it was pretty bland. The dish was also a little too moist. Chicken & Rice: This was the worst thing we had. The rice was super moist and the flavor was overall gross. Very overpowered with saffron and it was just a goop of brown rice and a chicken thigh (which also made it ridiculous to share).Finally, as we finished up the second pitcher of sangria, we were reminded that our time was up and that it was time for us to leave. This felt pretty rude to be rushed out of a restaurant and it would've been nice if they mentioned this when taking our reservation. In addition, we had ordered an entire pitcher no more that 15-20 minutes before this, but I think it was clear that we were unhappy with the main entrees. All in all, if you want tasty tapas and have no intention of spending time chatting with friends and family then this place is alright. The sangria is mediocre, the paella is subpar, and the chicken and rice is downright awful.",

At first glance, it looked like a fancy stuffy establishment, but upon arriving, the service was friendly and attentive. The Spanish wine choices are great. I've been recommended a few of them and haven't been disappointed. The food is fantastic. I recommend coming in a large group (4+) so that you can order many plates to share. If it's an intimate date place you're looking for, Iberica works. If you have a large group (12+), Iberica works also. Just about everything on the menu is great, so be adventurous.

The olive bread served at the start was so good, and two types of olive oil were offered for tasting. There were quite a few exotic and adventurous dishes on the menu. All the food we chose was delicious, but my favourites were the black squid rice and the octopus and potato dish.The dessert menu was delectable. We shared a selection of sweets, including a fried cheese, which had a unique but amazing taste. To finish the evening we all had glasses of a dessert wine called Phachara which I would be sure not to miss.When I left the restaurant we popped in to a little wine and cheese bar downstairs, which was amazing.

The chorizo lollipops in light batter with a tasty dip, and yours sincerely even had a go on the cod fritters (I am not a fish person)...damned good fun even though it was a quiet afternoon.

    "text": "One remains an eternal learner when it comes to food, and all the better for it. That lets you go and try again and again and again.Nevertheless, I feel the need to disclose that there's a rather long list of Spanish restaurants in my Foursquare account - my version of the Iberian pilgrimage.And thus, let me rate Iberica with a view on how it performs relative to its brothers and sisters and friends and foes here in London. In brief: quite well, albeit clearly on the rustic side of things.Don't expect overly delicate food. Here's some proper Spanish character in play; lots of frying, lots of pig, big chunks of bread. Nothing poncey going on here - and it shows, given that the entire crowd at the bar appeared to be conversing in espagnol.Nosh report: tender fried monkfish parcels with a lemon slice; sardines in a tomato gazpacho; fried and spicy rabbit with aioli (btw, garlic is quite a staple at Iberica - date alert); artichokes which were, you guessed it, fried and served with aioli. A caramel dessert must have been prepared with a dozen eggs; good I had a PX to wash it down.So my verdict: great place, more authentic than other Tapas bars in London, but probably not my favourite. Tapas Brindisa or El Parador make the race, with Dehesa and Fino on their heels.",

I longed for one of the many bulging glasses of red wine I saw poured time and time again, I craved a mouthful of their charcuterie repertoire, I yearned to smear their cheese all over my face (some would invariably end up in my mouth, right?)So while you're probably reading this thinking I'm some sort of strange Oliver Twistiflie, I can assure you this is not the case. (Erm, well, not entirely.) I actually lived right across the street with a direct window view into this fab Spanish inspired eatery, so it was only a matter of time before I made my fantasy a reality.Twice.In one week. There's a lot to be said when a restaurant leaves you wanting more and more and more... especially after a three month peeping Tom build up!",

The last two times I made a Top Table reservation they mysteriously lost it. \u00a0Ask to be in the main room by the windows (better atmosphere and it's less stuffy). -They don't do cocktails, really only wine (but they have a fantastic Spanish wine list). \u00a0If pressed they will make mojitos, but seriously stick to the wine. -Order the black rice - it's like paella with squid ink. \u00a0Fantastic!",

Best thing we ordered was the traditional tortilla (omlette) just perfect, made to order. My personal highlight although was that didn't feel rushed.

As in many restaurants, waiters share tables, so this is not a criticism of all, just the first waiter who took our order. He kept steering us to the most expensive items whether they met our preferences or not. Also, I'm pretty sure he heard us order tap water, but brought bottled still water and proceeded to open it before we could object. It was stressful to deal with him. The meal improved when he no longer waited on us. The other waiters were polite and efficient.",

It is so tasty and melts in your mouth! I could have eaten a whole other portionWe also got a sangria and for dessert we got churros which came with a small bowl of melted chocolate. The churros were so fresh and the chocolate wasn't too sweet - absolutely perfect!The only reason I would have not given it a full 5 stars and only a 4.5 is because the servers seemed not really to come to us unless we called them over.

Perhaps us Americans have a different set of standards in what we expect from service staff because we tip ours for great service, but the two gentleman working the main dining room during our visit were laughably slow and less than competent. Perhaps it was an off night but it was bad enough to potentially deter me from a return visit on my next trip.",

There were 8 of us and my guests ate everything.We all ordered some Cava and beers to accompany our feast. We started with Tr\u00edo de Ib\u00e9ricos, Cured Meat Selection, Ib\u00e9rico de Bellota Pork Loin and the Cheese SelectionBoard. All charcuterie were salty preserved perfection. The cheese was nutty and a great accompaniment.We moved on to the Tapas, Padron Peppers, Twice Cooked Lamb, Octopus a la Gallega, Garlic Prawns (we ordered 2), Black Rice (we ordered 2 - this was so wonderful but our teeth were black from the squid ink so it was quite a scene at our table).I also ordered some mushrooms, mackerel, and cod. My dinner guests were a little worried about the mackerel, it was quite strong, but I love it.They were busy and our server got a little lost throughout our meal. We had to repeatedly flag down other servers to help him out. When you sit upstairs, maybe service can be a challenge.The tables downstairs seemed lovely and intimate.I'll be back.",

    "text": "Some of the best Spanish food I have had outside of Spain, right here in London! Iberica Marylebone, a restaurant with a unique take on traditional Spanish cuisine, utilizing the dynamic flavors of the season to shape a menu that offers regional specialties and culinary adaptations of the best of Spanish food. The first thing I have to say about Iberica Marylebone is how stunning the restaurant design is. Floor to ceiling windows light the place up with sunshine from outside, which looks beautiful against the neutral colors of the restaurant's interiors. The balconies, mixed with the railings and the gorgeous light fixtures over the huge bar really give it an authentic Spanish feel. During our dining experience we enjoyed a selection of traditional tapas, such as the spring onion tempura, which was lightly battered and seasoned, so as to not overpower the rich flavor of the onion, and the sliced cooked beef with a flavorful dressing. We shared the \"Trio of Ibericos\", a selection of three Iberico hams from different regions of Spain. Ham is ham, right? Nope. Each piece had a distinct taste, robust flavor, with varying levels of saltiness and sweetness. \u00a0They also exceeded my expectations when it came to my favorite part of the meal: dessert. I fell in love with the Gloria cheesecake, an exquisite mix of density and airiness in the richness of the cake, and the salty parmesan and dried strawberries complemented the dessert wonderfully. Our food arrived at a great pace, and our server was right on top of filling our drinks and attending to our needs. I can't say enough great things about Iberica Marylebone. The atmosphere, the design, the service, and most importantly, the food is all incredible! I highly recommend this restaurant for excellence in Spanish cuisine, and I can't wait to go back for more, myself!",

We ordered 6 tapas and a main to share among three people, which turned out to be just nice. My favorite dish was definitely the chicken rice, which turned out to be more like a paella dish! It was absolutely yummy. My friends who came along with me too enjoyed the other tapas dishes. The vegetarian options though were disappointingly scarce, if there is any suggestion I can give, it would be to include more vegetarian options. Nonetheless, the beetroot and apple salad, and the cauliflower and bakchoi tapas tasted quite okay as well.",

    "text": "Fitzrovia is a veritable hub of great restaurant options, however Iberica has to be one of my favourite of the bunch. It doesn't help that it frequently tempts, being just across from my office, being too convenient to resist! Closer to Great Portland Street than most (literally about 2 minutes' walk) this lovely Spanish tapas style restaurant has never disappointed me. Think; lots of tasty, flavour rich plates, great for sharing and savouring. The creamy black rice with squid, prawns and \u00a0alioli sauce is always a must and a firm staple - which is fantastic as it's also on the \u00a315 lunch menu. Although you're going to need to be careful, this black ambrosia will stain! The \u00a315 lunch menu is a fantastic deal, you get three dishes from a selection, the express lunch is also good. I would recommend their chorizo lollipops with pear alioli sauce and tr\u00edo of Ib\u00e9ricos - although having been to Spain, I am obsessed with this Spanish cured meat treat! However I haven't had anything bad from the menu, although I found the aubergine with honey to be an 'interesting' try, but too sweet to be a repeat order. The atmosphere inside is also lovely, it feels warm, comfortable (even when I have to sit at the bar, which is frequently, having not made a reservation), and I love the white and blue tiles and beautiful hanging lanterns. The house style mezzanine, provides a homely, established feel. It comes with a good sized price tag, so definitely a treat rather than everyday option - however perfect for a nice laid back leisurely lunch, and equally a 'impress them' date. I also like the quality of the red wine, I can't recall what I've drunk before, but I've had a bit of a selection from the menu, and have never been disappointed.",
