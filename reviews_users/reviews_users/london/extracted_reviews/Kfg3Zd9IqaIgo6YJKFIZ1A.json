However it is different from many of the Indian restaurants out there. Definitely to be considered an upmarket dining experience.We opted to get a selection of small (2 piece) and larger (4 piece dishes) to share between four - a bit like Indian tapas but I think the vegetarian tasting menus might actually be better value once you add it all up. The stand out dish for me was a fish dish which was delightfully coconutty and left me wishing I didn't have to share itThe restaurant comes from the owners of Masala Zone of all places, and also Veeraswamy, one of the oldest Indian restaurants in London.",

As has been reported before, this is not your typical Indian restaurant or curry house. Amaya offers a very high-end, modern, well-crafted, and inspired interpretation of Indian food. Spices are incredibly well balanced, ensuring that no single flavor will overwhelm or mask others.We chose to go with the gourmet tasting menu. While expensive, it was quite a worthwhile experience. The seared foie gras was unlike anything I'd tasted before (and I am a fan of foie gras, in moderation, of course!)The tandoori prawns and lobster masala were excellent. The biryani chicken was beautifully presented, and tasted even better than it looked. We finished the meal with the dessert sampler, which was intricately composed and arranged, and offered a nice range of flavors and textures. My favorite items were the amazing (and incredibly rich) chocolate rasmalai, and, on the other end of the richness scale, the very light and satisfying gramolata.If you know of anyone who appreciates high-end food but doesn't particularly care for Indian cuisine, Amaya will make a convert out of them.",

If you're the kind that likes to see doodles & decorations on your plate that take up valuable real estate, this would be the place to visit. The food tends to be fairy bland (non-spicy) but tastes good. When we ate there, the waiters sniffed out our mild surprise & kept asking if we wanted 'naan' with our platters. I imagine most Indians like me are mildly surprised at how non-Indian the presentation is.Worth going to once just to see what the fuss is all about. For the most part I'll be sticking to my regular favs. If you're Indian or have eaten enough Indian food to have formed a strong opinion about it, be sure to read all the 3 star reviews before you go eat here since it is an expensive place.The 'glamour prep' area is visible, clean & fairly entertaining. The toilets are downstairs. NOT good if you're in a wheelchair.Also, this was the first Indian joint I've eaten at in London where the waiters didn't seem 100% friendly. I don't remember being smiled at & that's why this review has one less star than it could have had.",

We were utterly disappointed with this place. The decor was modern, not much character. I really loved Masala Zone in Covent Garden which was decorated in the Rajasthani dolls theme. The service was terrible, we had a French waiter who had no idea what any Indian dish meant. Most disappointing was their vegetarian selection, I guess the idea of vegetables on the grill and calling it kabab simply does not work. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the manager and he said that they simply don't cater into this market. Well, I wholeheartedly agree!",

We tried the chefs gourmet menu at 80\u00a3 per person. The menu may look like there's a lot of food (around 12 courses) but bear in mind some are only \"one bite\" like one oyster & one shrimp & one scallop. That's considered three courses already.Verdict...not worth the price. This is not an Indian restaurant per se, they are more of an Indian grill / fusion fine dining restaurant. If you're looking for authentic spicy kind of Indian food, go somewhere. But if you're celebrating an occasion or trying to impress your date, come here.Food is mild in taste with a hint of Indian spices. Most items are freshly grilled in the open kitchen.Service is very good. We had some issues & the restaurant manager corrected it immediately & accommodated our requests. Don't forget the dessert bowl for 2 person. The presentation will blow your mind! Nice ending to the meal. One upsetting thing is they don't allow flash photography. RRRAAHHHH !",

The food is creative, rich in flavors, and perfectly prepared. They do some traditional Indian dishes (and those are typically better than what you'd get at your favorite local Indian restaurant), but then there is a level of creativity on the menu that I have never seen in an Indian restaurant before. The delivery style is unique in that you select different dishes based on how long they take to cook so that the dishes just continue to flow out throughout the meal. This is a concept that I wish other restaurants adopted. You can order small or large portions. We ordered the small portion for all of the dishes and our meal was the equivalent of Indian tapas - how can you beat that? I wish there was an Amaya in NYC! I would be a regular!",

Trying to book a table here is near impossible, and for the life of me I don't know why. It is popular but not in that way that everyone knows about it. I feel that they hold a lot of tables back because when I have been able to book a table, it is always at times I didn't want -6:45pm or 9:30pm! And there are many available tables before and after my arrival. But whoever the hostess is taking bookings, her attitude is very much a Little Britain: 'the computer says nawoooo...' Whatever it is and whoever she is, I have yet to be be able to get a table at at a 7:30pm/8pm time even a couple weeks in advance. Though should you manage to get a table, this is very exciting Indian cuisine. The decor is a very posh oasis, and the cuisine is cosmopolitan while still maintaining the flavors of all that one loves about Indian food. Many of the dishes are served tapas size so it makes it nice to mix and share at the table, or to try a variety of dishes. I personally love anything they make with their green curry, and the most amazing starter of a fig mixture that has been diced and slightly spiced so you have the sweetness of the fruit mixed with the heat of the spice. Really, really tasty. I have never had anything I did not like here.One important note here is that the space is noisy and makes it difficult for conversation. Don't go on a romantic dinner here, and don't go if you want to catch up chatting with a mate as at some point during the course of the evening, trying to hear the person across from you is very difficult over the roar of the room. Now if only I could bypass the velvet rope... I'd go there much more often...",

    "text": "Don't you hate reviews that have some random axe to grind with a restaurant, and so give them a bad rating? So do I, but I have finally had an experience that has prompted me to join that lowly fraternity.The food and the service (from our waiter, anyway) at Amaya warrant more than a 1-star rating (probably a 3-4 star level), but the management of Amaya managed to completely knock all of that out of our minds. A quick background - we sometimes make reservations with OpenTable, a service to which Amaya subscribes as well. After (at least) 100 completed reservations, you can get a dining cheque good for \u00a375 at any OpenTable restaurant (and the terms clearly state *any* OpenTable restaurant). We recently redeemed for such a cheque, made our reservation for Amaya through OpenTable, and happily skipped off to dine there, anticipating a smooth and delicious experience.However, when the bill came, the manager absolutely refused to accept the cheque. Moreover, he did so in a completely humiliating manner, implying strongly that we were trying to put one over him, so to speak. He also implied that Amaya wasn't an OpenTable restaurant, despite the fact that we had made our reservation through OpenTable, and I can clearly still see them listed on that website.I don't think that I can adequately convey how upsetting this experience was. I was embarrassed in front of my guest, stared at by other patrons in the restaurant, and, frankly, had to end up spending \u00a375 more than I had planned. Not really the level of service that I expect from a 1-star Michelin restaurant, to say the least, especially considering that they had our credit card for the remaining \u00a360+ of the bill (above the \u00a375), and could have charged us the balance if there had been a problem. I left the restaurant with a very bad taste in my mouth (so to speak!), and will urge my friends and family not to go there. Yummy food is one thing, but bad management can easily take all of that away. If I want Michelin-quality Indian food, I will take my business to Rasoi or Tamarind in the future, where I have experienced good food, good service, and competent management. Bleah.",

Period. \u00a0Full stop.15 words or more: \u00a0This place does not pretend to be a mom-and-pop or zonky Indian restaurant. \u00a0This place tries to be a a Michelin quality restaurant competing against every high-end restaurant in town regardless of cuisine. \u00a0And this restaurant delivers with a depth of dishes to match the depth of flavors. \u00a0When looking for Indian food done at a high level and in a contemporary way, this is the place to go. \u00a0I have been twice and would keep going back. \u00a0The concept is simple -- small plates that are meant to be shared. The dishes come out from three different kitchens and come out when ready. \u00a0As such, the restaurant has smartly divided the menu into groups, so you have a sense of when a dish may come out (sooner, later, much later). \u00a0On this visit, we (2 of us) had the following (the server recommended 6-8 dishes for 2 people):Tandoori black pepper chicken tikka -- tender lumps of boneless chicken coated in black peppercorns. \u00a0The chicken is perfectly cooked and the pepper does offer a little kick of spice.Grilled asparagus with onion chutney -- large spears perfectly cooked. \u00a0The dish offers a nice mix of slightly crunchy with a slightly sweet glaze. \u00a0A nice vegetable offering on the menu.Tandoori quail with apricot glaze spices and herbs -- the quail was just great. \u00a0The apricot glaze is of course on the sweeter side. \u00a0I would recommend using the sauces dabbed on the plate to the side of the quail to provide a great enhancement of spice and flavor. \u00a0Tandoori monk fish with turmeric and fenugreek -- tremendous chunks of meaty fish that are cooked to tender perfection. \u00a0This is a great dish and a must.Grilled lamb chops with ginger lime and coriander -- awesome. \u00a0The chops are so perfectly tender that we were picking them up and eating every last bit of lamb from the bone.Tandoori organic paneer tikka -- holy cow indeed. \u00a0What a dish. \u00a0The paneer was just so fluffy and tasty. Warm crispy apple brioche with cinnamon milk foam -- this was the one dish I could have passed on. \u00a0The foam was out of control good, but the brioche was just okay.",

We had an early reservation - 6:30 - and arrived at 6:25 - though we couldn't sit until 6:30 because that was when the restaurant opened. I cant remember the specifics of what we ordered because the menu is not available online - but some mushroom appetizer, the tandoor broccoli \u00a0(FANTASTIC), mango lassi (actually disappointing--especially since it was 7 pounds), and the chicken curry. The chicken curry was delicious, but not mind blowing. Also, they told us it would take 45 minutes to make, but then it came out 15 minutes later... not sure what happened. The service was excellent, prompt, attentive. I think they do try to turn over the tables, which is understandable given how popular the place is. The food was interesting and delicious, and there are SO many items on the menu you could come here 20 times and have a different meal every time.",

Without a reservation, the restaurant gets quite crowded and we had to wait a bit for a table. Their waiting area has plush cushions that are nice. The ambiance is dimly lit, very trendy decor inside, and spacious seating areas. Once we were seated, the waiters were attentive and friendly. Their recommendations were on the money. I ordered the chicken biryani; it came in a clay pot and was delicious. The waiter warned me beforehand that the biryani takes a longer time to cook, but I said we were in a hurry and they sped up the preparation for me. Really great service here! I loved the food, but the drinks fell flat. With that being said, this place is quite pricey.",

It's not a cheap place though--instead of a mound of food like you would get at most restaurants, each portion comes as 4 large bites. And some of the nicer meats cost upwards of \u00a320 for those 4 large bites. They have a tasting menu too, though it seemed a bit overpriced at \u00a338 pp (I think it would be cheaper to order individual dishes, but it depends on the size of your party). We had 5 meat eaters at the table, so we had to cut everything up so that everyone could have a share. Non food stuff: The coat check was fairly quick for coats, but they took over 5 minutes to find my backpack! Most of the clientele looked like early middle-aged Mayfair/Knightsbridge types, but you have the occasional young uber trendy couples there too. I dont know if they were famous, or just wanted to look like they were.

The concept is to share (like tapa) so when you order Black Pepper Chicken Tikka Masala (about \u00a312), you get 4 bite size pieces of chicken. If there more than 4 at a table, they recommend ordering 2 plates of the same item.Since we didn't know the portions, we ordered what we thought was a reasonable amount. Unfortunately, we didn't order enough to asked for more food. Our meat dishes came quickly but had to wait a long time for our sweet potato side dish. We even asked if it was possible to cancel the order. When the dish finally arrived, everything else was gone. A slightly disappointing ending just eating sweet potatoes on its own. TIP: Ask for rice and naan to arrive when dishes arrive. Ours came first, so went cold by the time the other dishes arrived.",

    "text": "We went to Amaya for my brother's Birthday lunch, and I regret to say that it completely ruined the day. The restaurant is stylish and the food itself is tasty, although VERY small in portion. However, this was overshadowed by the complete incompetence of the staff coupled with a somewhat incomprehensible rudeness of attitude, which would not be expected given the location, the price range and presumably also the desired clientele of this establishment. Our visit went off to a bad start when my brother's partner had her cocktail spilled not once, but twice, without a word of apology or an offer of a substitute drink on the house. This was made worse by the attitude of the waitress who, rather than trying to deal with this shortcoming and the exceedingly long waiting times, briefly informed us that they were understaffed and put any shortcomings down to insufficient training. To our dismay, she however felt very confident in telling us in no subtle terms that we \"need one more meal\" and that this meal should be bigger, as the portions were small. Other hick-ups aside, our main grievance was caused by a waiter who, when putting our main course on the table, broke my cocktail glass which sent splinters flying across the table, including my brother's water and wine glass. Without uttering one word of apology, he took my broken cocktail glass and left, leaving the table covered in splinters. It was only through our insistance that my brother's glasses were taken away. The least we would have expected from such an 'up-market' establishment was to offer a complimentary drink as a way of apology, however this was not forthcoming, and neither was a new set of glasses for my brother to use. While the waitress eventually remedied this after our repeated insistence, she put the whole incident down to the already mentioned understaffing, and did not engage with us any further. My cocktail only appeared after our repeated reminders about 45mins later. As such the only area where Amaya showed admirable speed was in alerting us to the closing of the kitchen and in bringing us the bill. A restaurant so disengaged with customers' expectations and so devoid of manners in case of clear staff shortcomings has in our view no place in such an upmarket area.",

    "text": "For starters the menu was beyond confusing - not sure what they were trying to accomplish. We were a hungry table of 6 and were very frustrated as to what to order. The delivery of food didn't make sense (e.g. The bread and rice were missing when we needed it) and no mint yoghurt on the table. The meat entrees were not great mostly because I felt the meats were not high quality and they were rather flavorless. We had three chicken and two lamb dishes. The lamb curry was inedible and the chicken lettuce wraps were soaked with sauce. The Vegetarian food was tasty- but nothing special. The green beans were very good and the fried tofu was yummy. The dessert - \"passion in a box\" was very good. The mint yogurt was very tasty....surprisingly. Very yogurt-y and spices the way I like it. However we had to ask for it 3 times and they only brought a tiny cup of it for a table of 6 and we had to request more. The atmosphere was beautiful and the service was very good... which is the only reason I would give Amaya a 3 and not a 2. I love Indian food but sadly I would not go to this restuarant again.",

When you make your reservation, Ask for a table close to the chefs who are in the open cooking using 3 clay tandoor, a coal grill and a griddle. Food is served tapas style. 2 to 3 dishes should be ordered per person. Recommend the chicken Lolly pops, the char grilled Madagascan prawn (largest prawn I have ever had in my life) and the lobster. Don't forget some incredible Naan ( garlic, butter, seasoned ) and the spices and chutney tray. Everything had extraordinary spices and flavours. Incredible food presentation and service. Dessert was different but I will pass next time. I had never been asked in all my dining experiences by a manager at the end: is there anything we could have done to make this dining experience better? Enough said. When in London and you are looking for an Indian fix and you are willing to pay for the experience \u00a0Amaya it is.",

We started at the bar where we had some wild cocktails. \u00a0Mine had chile spice and papaya in it, YUM!We had the gourmet tasting menu, several courses. \u00a0Every single course was inspired by Indian cuisine which is to say that it used some kind of Indian-based spice or herb or flavor, but every single course was beautifully prepared and inventive.I'll try to remember each:1. Cheese, fruit, herbs in a bitter lettuce cup2. oysters, scallops, shrimp done 3 different ways, including a lime coriander and a red chile sauce \u00a03.roasted broccoli with a spiced yogurt on top, we mixed it all in4. chicken skewers with black peppercorns and a dipping sauce5. lamb chops with minced spiced lamb wrapped in caul fat, this was incredible6. Canadian lobster with a masala sauce, absolutely incredible, perfectly cooked, not rubbery7. biranye in a pot with a crust on top8. 3 dessertsMy only disappointment with this meal was the lack of vegetables, but that is not uncommon when you order a tasting menu in just about any restaurant. \u00a0If I had to eat vegetarian for the rest of my life, I would lean heavily on Indian cuisine, because they do such great things with vegetables!",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Amaya on the last night of a 10-day whirlwind tour of Europe. After an evening flight into Heathrow, we rushed-rushed-rushed to Paddington Station, and then rushed-rushed-rushed again to make our 10:30 p.m. Sunday reservation at Amaya.We made it to Amaya at 10:32, and were cautioned that the kitchen was getting ready to close any minute, but if we made our orders quickly, we'd be able to dine there that evening. A bit odd, we thought, considering they accepted online reservations for 10:30 p.m., but we obliged.Boy, am I glad we did, and were wholeheartedly impressed with this modern take on Indian food. Unfortunately, we were probably a bit too rushed to fully enjoy the decor and ambiance, but food-wise it was a perfect ending to, and typified, our European adventure.We tried the black pepper chicken tikka skewers, tandoori roasted broccoli with yoghurt, naan, basmati rice, and a mango lassi. The mango lassi was OK, and a little on the room temperature side, and a bit steep at \u00a37. However, the naan was likely the best I've ever eaten, and the tandoori broccoli with yoghurt was like a dream. Creamy, flavorful, spicy and tantalizing. It was one of the finest vegetable dishes I ever tasted. The pepper chicken tikka had nice, but not aggressive spice, and made us wish we had doubled our order.We also tried a tasty salad side, but I cannot remember many details other than it had grapes, goat cheese, and crispy raman noodles, and wonderful crunch and citrus notes.If and when I return to London, I can't wait to explore more of this menu, unrushed. I won't be sharing my tandoori broccoli, however. It will all be for me!",

We loved it and I think some if the reviews below are totally unreasonable.There's a run of great places to eat on Motcomb Street, namely Ottolenghi, and this one goes on my list.Beautifully designed, the first thing to mention is the atmosphere. With an open kitchen showing the three grills off in their full glory, there's a definite sense that you're somewhere special.The menu is unusual; divided into three sections according to the time dishes take to arrive at the table from the grills. All of the waiters are fantastic, very attentive and providing good direction on what to order. Their recommendation is to pick 6-8 dishes from the three sections, then end with a larger curry to share. We chose to do this over the tasting menu, as we liked the menu so much we wanted to pick & choose.We had the black pepper chicken (a must have), sirloin boti (incredible), tandoori broccoli with ginger & yoghurt, Madagascan prawn with lime and then a lamb osso-bucco curry with brown rice & naan.Truly one of the best Indian meals I've ever had in my life. Not cheap by any means, but well worth it for a special occasion or a treat.",

    "text": "Amaya is a fun One Michelin Starred restaurant to visit if you are in London and in the mood for solid modern Indian cuisine. We made a very last minute reservation just minutes before the last seating which turned into us being one of the last patrons of the restaurant. Once you find this place, you enter a really cool modern vibed restaurant. They sat us at a table near their open tandoor station and in front of their vegetable station. We got to watch our food being made, it added to the great experience.They give you a menu that is broken up into 3 categories for both Vegetarian and Nonveg eaters - a quick menu that can be brought out first (smaller dishes), a medium menu and a longer to make (curries and bigger portions) menu - the idea being that you can order a few small dishes which come out first, then the medium then longer dishes come out efficiently in order with no time wasted in waiting for food. It takes a fair amount of time reading through the menu to figure out what you want.The food flavors were great, we loved all tandoor and vegetable dishes.Their fruit cocktails were terrible. We tried 3 different kinds with each tasting like it was made with chemicals instead of fruits. Service was slow and even though the menu was made to be time-efficient, I feel like we still did a lot of waiting. We ended up being in the restaurant for two and a half hours, most of that time spent waiting for the longer to make dishes which we could have done without.We left the restaurant feeling very full but we were satisfied. I would recommend this place for a great and very different dining experience.",

Instead, Amaya uses three core Indian grilling styles: Tandoor (hot clay oven), Sigri (over a coal flame) and Tawa (searing and griddling on a hot plate).Dishes change through the seasons. We ordered coconut crusted mackerel, tamarind aubergine, a spicy quail dish and black pepper chicken tikka. The black pepper chicken tikka seems like it's a menu regular. Each dish was uniquely spiced and perfectly tender. The naan was also some of the best I've ever had.Service is friendly and efficient.One Michelin star.I will definitely come back and try their sister restaurants, Chutney Mary and Veeraswarmy, which the hostess said served broader fare, including curries, etc.",

    "text": "Punchline: food was amazing, service was better than we've seen in London, and we left with full bellies. Our favorites were the lamb shank, the tandoori chicken chops, and noodle salad. For a person who doesn't typically like noodles this dish was great - lots of texture. Also good was the chicken kebab (with yummy green chutney). Ranked lower, for us personally, was the chicken lollipops, which were sweeter than I expected, and chicken biryani, which my boyfriend really liked, but I found to be plain (I was looking forward to nuts and raisins to which it didn't have any). Overall, the food was delicious. This restaurant came recommended, but it was booked solid on Open Table for four days out. We tried our luck and walked in at 7:30pm. We were offered a table at the \"long table\" that they needed back at 9:30pm, which was perfect. Since we sat at the long, share table, our seats didn't really have a back and it was more of high top style which isn't my favorite. But again, happy they were able to accommodate us. We skipped dessert, but had a glass of Pinot Noir and a beer.",

    "text": "First Impression... WoW this is a very nice, fancy place. I'm excited for my Indian meal in London! (My friend said Indian food in London is great so I looked up on on Yelp and landed upon this place.)Strike One: No photographs allowed in the restaurant. WTF. Seriously? I'm going to pay a bajillion pounds for the food and I can't take pics of the food? You've gotta be kidding me. Stuck up snobs. Strike Two: You can't order just one tasting menu. Apparently you have to have at least 2... which was a problem for us since 2 of us wanted the vegetarian tasting menu and one of us, who could eat meat, wanted the regular tasting menu. So... the one who could eat meat just order chicken curry... which was a lot less expensive than the tasting menu. Fail on the restaurant part... you could've made more money had you allowed the 1 portion tasting menu. Strike Three: I wanted to get the full experience so I order one of the more expensive drinks.. a 14 pounds ($22) drink. However the glass it came in made it super difficult to drink since the lip curves in. Um... hello? I want the liquid to go into my mouth, not back into the glass. Idiots. Oh... and just in case 3 strikes wasn't enough. They highly discourage you to order the curry. They say, \"I'm sorry it's going to take 45 minutes to make.\" As if they are asking you, \"Are you sure you want to order that? It's going to take forever to get to your table. Maybe you should order something else.\"Anyways... the good thing was that the chicken curry was good... and it did not take 45 mintues... and the bokchoy w/ the corn was good. 169 pounds ($253) later... totally NOT worth it. I do not recommend this restaurant and will not return. P.S. I sniped some photos even though I wasn't allowed to... and they are terrible because I had to snipe them but that's ok... it's their fault for not allowing people to take pretty photos to make their food look good.",

They recommend you order 6 dishes because it is family style and meant to be shared. Don't be alarmed if you are not full with the first few plates. If you ordered rice and curry, you will leave stuffed. Trust me. We ordered:-Chicken Parcels (lettuce wraps basically)-Chicken Tikka-Spicy Prawns-Broccoli-Naan-Chicken Curry-Chicken Biryani-Rose Kulfi-Lime TartEverything was so delicious and clean tasting. This was definitely a modern Indian restaurant. We ordered too much food before the rice and curry dishes arrived so that was a mistake. But everything was so delicious it was unbelievable. We recommend doing the same thing by ordering a bunch of different plates but keeping in mind the rice will fill you up so much. But definitely worth the try. Our waitress was a bit monotone and pushy but that could be the atmosphere there. Overall, everything was outstanding. The rose kulfi was the best dessert and the shrimp and chicken parcels were the standouts. It is rather trendy so dress for a nice dinner out.",

We just love Indian food and can appreciate the different flavors and levels of sophistication ranging from street food like samosas to more elegant fusion type cuisine. Our mind was made up when our friend, who travels frequently to the UK and is quite a foodie himself, verified that our research on the conde naste and yelp sites got it right when they touted Amaya. We were not disappointed. The space itself is contemporary with high ceilings, simple wood top tables many of them with a close up view of the open kitchen. Our server who initially thought we looked like regulars, was very attentive and made several recommendations. The owner also stopped by to make sure we were enjoying which was a lovely touch. I asked for a sample of two different red wines before committing to the Italian Barolo. The wine by the glass list was very nice. My husband sipped on a cocktail which he seemed to enjoy. We ordered several small plates and finished with a shrimp curry and some garlic Naan. We started with the tandoor grilled prawns, the Bronzino, the arugula pomegranate salad, chicken tikka and the broccoli small plate. All were just delicious and many of them prepared on their grills. The plating was pretty, if not over the top. The flavor profiles really worked. We didn't opt for dessert because we were so full. But we did enjoy our tea service. Although this is not your average curry row or brick lane joint, and the prices reflect the sophisticated location, decor and food, we felt it was really worth it. The food is very good and the dining experience very pleasant.",

Normally that is not a desirable table but here the preparation observation is part of the experience. I had a signature martini that had just the right amount of Chili, it was very well balanced. The four of us ordered the Gourmet Menu, which lays out the menu for the evening. FYI the whole table must order the same tasting menu.

    "text": "Last week I was with my friend visiting London for the first time so we decided to try the best restaurants in town. My friend being Indian and me not knowing anything about the culture or its food we decided to make reservations at this amazing restaurant. Hands down on of the best gastronomic experiences I've ever had. We wanted to try their prix fixe menu but unfortunately we made the reservation too late and the kitchen was no longer serving it (make sure to book reservations before 10:30pm if you want the prix fixe menu), so we went ahead and follow the waiter's suggestions! At first I was a little hesitant knowing that Indians tend to put a lot of species on their dishes but once the first dish arrived the explosion of flavors blew my mind. Every single dish had its own special magic and colors. As I mentioned before it was one of the best gastronomic experiences I've ever had. Last but not least I want to mention the amazing staff and our waiter who went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I were completely satisfied with the food and service.",

    "text": "Hip restaurant that presents Indian food like you've never seen it and in some cases never tasted but overall it didn't live up to expectations. The most annoying part of the dining experience was that they wouldn't let you get the tasting menu unless you had 2 or more people. I understand why you can't do it if the whole table doesn't do it but if you're a lone diner, it feels unfair you can't get the tasting menu -- maybe doubly unfair because normally you rely on the tasting menu to get a little taste of everything. Because of this, maybe I just couldn't sample enough to really find the hidden gems.The best dishes were the sea bass and the chicken with peanut sauce starters. The seabass had an incredible sauce and the chicken was super tender and juicy yet nicely charred. Those did blow my mind.It went downhill from there.The eggplant (aubergine) was a disappointment. It was half a thin eggplant that wasn't particularly transformed into anything that marvelous or at least delicious. The venison ended up being much more tubular than I had imagined with an interesting sauce shoved inside. \u00a0It was okay. The naan was perfectly cooked so I'll give them that.The lamb curry though was good but not great -- but had been built up a lot by the waiter to be the best thing to finish with.I felt a bit nickel and dimed by having to pay for rice and the chutney sauces. The service was great -- fast, attentive, and friendly. I just think it could have indeed been the best (or among the best at least) Indian food I've ever had (in London, NYC or SF which are my comparison set), but it didn't overall transform my impression of good Indian food the way I expected it -- plus the price was way higher, which I understand as a michelin restaurant it can justify on prestige alone, but I just didn't think it was good value. Maybe I'm just bitter I couldn't get it all on the tasting menu for less! But, please don't think me a complainer just cause of costs as I've had Noma, Joel Robuchon, etc. and I found those worth the price. I just think this was okay for a Michelin experience and good Indian food, but not something I'd look to repeat again.",

It's an Indian Restaurant but ultra modern and the food is consistently creative while never ever loosing touch of its authenticity and heritage. The grilled meats in particular are a fine example of this and they also do one of the best tasting menus I've ever had. There's also a bar in one section of the restaurant and although I'm not a huge fan of the cocktails and curry combination it feels much more natural here. Nothing is done purely for the sake of following trend and the setting does complete the occasion. And most occasions are suited to this place, especially those that fall just after payday - Amaya doesn't come cheap.",

The food wasn't quite as good the second time round, and for the price tag you'd really expect the best. The food is Indian tapas which is a pretty neat concept. This of course means you're driven to ordering a bit of everything. Some of the highlights are the lamb cutlets, the broccoli and yoghurt, the tandoori chicken and the chicken biryani (which was amazing the first time round, not so good the second time). The cocktails are amazing. I would highly recommend getting there a bit early and sampling one or two. They do a great chilli Martini (or they did the last time I went). The ambiance is decadent (as you'd expect for the area). I like the fact you can see what's gong on in the kitchen, it adds a buzz and energy to a place that could be stiff in other circumstances. Will I go back? Well it really is pricey, so pricey that you need to be prepared to have a big hole in your wallet when you leave, especially if you go to town on the 'tapas' and cocktails. Perhaps I will if I win the lottery. I kind of wish they hadn't changed their chef though.",

The staff was nicely dressed, polite and sure knew what they were doing. We even got a very entertaining lecture on champagne. The food was absolutely spot on. Not the usual 'curry' but a tapas style way of eating which means you really get an experience rather than a meal. We all ordered something and ended up eating our way through the whole range of food from the venison to the grouper. And don't get me started on the lamb what a feast. I am not one to use a lot of superlatives, but this was definitely the best food experience of 2010. I sure hope they can keep up the high expectations and we'll come back for more.",

    "text": "Amaya is one of London's top newish restaurants (2004). The creation of Amaya exemplifies the typical British mentality of appreciating cultures from a far and marketing them as much as possible. Many British are also known as having an adventure instinct, maybe because they once explored the world as much as anyone founded all dem colonies and shizzle, or maybe its simply because British people are a very curious bunch... maybe I shouldn't make the Brits into an anthropology project...Anyway, London's advancements lead to an upscale Indian restaurant as progressive as Obama's plans. \u00a0As you have read, Amaya is officially a tapas restaurant but if you are the type of Brit who hangs out in Knighsbridge, and goes to Amaya on a business meeting you are probably having the company write it off.Therefore, you certainly do not order tapas style as someone who doesn't want to spend \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 would (only get one appetizer sized dish each). No, you order as the waitress recommends:A full meal for everyone at your table. That means a great amount of dishes. Just a blur and swirl of the most exotic food that may ever be put in front of you in your life. Amaya's policy is that you order what you want when you want but whatever comes out first, they will serve it then and there. Now, Erase every perception in your mind of Indian food: a plate of rice, a little container of a chicken dish with some sauce, a basket of naan. Right, throw that all in a rubbish bin when you walk in to Amaya and except: Tiger Prawns on a kabob stick, the most sizzling sauces, a blend of masala you've never had, all sorts of naan breads. It's the mecca of that thin line between Brits being British London being London and Indian food at its impeccable prime to the taste buds of people living in London. Find yourself there? You must try Amaya! The Beautiful People Ranking: 8/10As I said, expect a lot of business men but a certain swankier London businessmen type who wears a fitted suite and drives a BMW. Girls who aren't especially dressed to the nines but are European beautiful, you'll see couples, fancies, and misc",

Think multi-course, delicate plates and excellent pairing. \u00a0The ambiance is nice, but not 'the coolest place ever' like a Hakesaan or Zuma, but the open-kitchen is a great touch and you can see all the food being prepared, which is quite a show as it is all meticulously done.If you're looking for traditional sag paneer, dal, naan and curries, this is not the place to go -- you can go to any one of the countless, fantastic run-of-the mill Indian places. \u00a0Amaya is different. \u00a0Every spice, leaf, nut and garnish is perfectly placed and calculated so that each bite is a complete piece of the dish.I wanted to go for the veg tasting menu, but the waiter said it would take 4 hours to complete! \u00a0If you have the time, this is always the best way to go at a place like this. \u00a0They have 3 or 4 tasting menus: meat, vegetarian and fish, and maybe a chef's choice but I can't remember. \u00a0I can't remember exactly what I had as it was a while back and I must have been in a sensory-overload haze, but I remember it all to be amazing. \u00a0Plus, great cocktails too! \u00a0If you love Indian, or have never had Indian outside a north-Indian curry restaurant, please give this place a shot and I promise you will be enlightened.",

In Knightsbridge !!! Are you kidding me ?But i understood, within minutes after walking in,why they could make this statement. Their menu does not have a single dish with gravy. An Indian restaurant totally devoid of curry. How many times have you seen that ? The only liquid item in the menu was dal.This is a grill house par excellence. The kebabs are at least as good as anywhere else in London, and to give Amaya the edge, it has a number of starters in their menu that you won't find anywhere else. Which other Indian restaurant serves venison kebab ? (strongly recommended btw). I tried the ground peanut and rose petal powders with the food ... it really amplified the taste.The wine list is good. Though i am not an expert, but i think i chose something that goes well with dry meat :)The place is expensive, but totally worth every pound of the bill.

It's a large restaurant, with a nice warm bar by the door, lots of natural light and cooking happening on the far walls. There is also an extensive specialty drink list, both alcoholic and non--I'll have to go back to try some out--and everything on the menu looked so good, I ended up getting a veritable veggie feast. My meal started with a slightly spicy green mango and papaya salad, which I really enjoyed. Once I was done with the salad, though, it seemed like the dishes just kept coming out! There was some paneer tikka, which is always one of my favorites, and a great fig and vegetable patty and some sweet potatoes with sauce. There was also some broccoli with a yogurt sauce, which was my least favorite dish \u00a0the broccoli was a bit overcooked and it was a much larger quantity than any of the other dishes, which was just incongruous and unappetizing to look at. There were some stuffed little chilies that I really liked, which were surprisingly sweet, no hot, and there was a veggie roll of some sort. The dishes were all served with a side of chutneys--one rhubarb and one tomato, which were both really delicious, and a peanutty spice powder and a rose and lavender powder, which was wonderful. All the dishes were presented really beautifully as well, on plates of various shapes in white ceramic and glass. There was also some grilled mango and a sort of passionfruit smoothie for dessert, which were nice and refreshing. Overall, a very extravagant lunch, but a fantastic, relaxing experience. It was nice to feel welcomed and taken care of as a single diner. I can't wait to go back for dinner and to bring friends along to share.",

WHAT!!!We spoke to the manager and he reiteritated the same sentiment! \u00a0We thought he'd prefer the \u00a0feedback personally however, he urged us to go online and once again was indifferent to our disposition. \u00a0It was very obvious that our experience was irrelevant to his need for sending the staff home. \u00a0Interestingly enough, what would they have done if I had accepted the 11:15 or even 11:30 reservation?In addition, our overall food service was quite mediocre. \u00a0Half the time we didn't know who the waiter was. \u00a0We asked for some spice to heat things up, and were given quite a bland sauce - isn't this an indian restaurant??Given the prices, inconsistency in serving great food, and much to be desired in terms of service, it is incredibly surprising to see the restaurant has received a Michelin star.If you have one night in London, a place known for it's incredible culinary options, DON\"T WASTE IT AT AMAYA!!",

I typically insist on having the tasting menus at new restaurants just to be able to get in as many of the specialities as I can and taste their range of dishes. Amaya makes this possible by serving most of the dishes tapas style. I went with a regular to Amaya who wasn't a very big eater. We chose 8 plates, 1 piece of naan each, and no rice, which turned out to be suitably filling. Had it just been my wife and I, we probably would have been satisfied with 10 dishes. We're fairly voluminous eaters (when no one else is around, then we scale in back a teeny bit!)The most memorable dishes were the Venison Seekh kebab (succulent, beautifully spiced, the guy I was with hadn't eaten meat in 10 years, but he still tried it and loved it), the Scallops on the half shell (in an absolutely delicious green curry), the pepper chicken tikka, the grilled jumbo prawns with I think a marsala marinade, the aubergine grilled with a tamarind type marinade (I may have got that wrong, but it tasted delicious) and the chicken joint. The green mango and raw papaya salad was also very very good.Followed by another couple of their martinis made for a superb lunch. I didn't pay so I can't comment on the prices but I can't wait to go back with my wife and really tackle the menu!",

All the items on the pre-fixe sampler plate were very flavorful and unique, exactly what I was searching for. \u00a0Even my jaded bf was very satisfied with the different options. \u00a0I could not tell you what exactly I was served, as details are never really important to me when trying something new, I just want to have an experience, and this was a very enjoyable experience. \u00a0The ambiance and service was first class, as well as the food and presentation. And despite the seemingly small portions, we were both very full by the end of the meal.The only problem I had was finding the restaurant. \u00a0Being a London virgin, it had completely slipped my mind that 'arcade' was in fact not a street name, but a pedestrian alley. So we circled around the block 3 times, even asking a policeman for help, to no avail. \u00a0Part of the problem is that the map on my iPod (even the cop got out his iPhone to help us out) shows the restaurant on the wrong side of the street. \u00a0I see that the address listed on Yelp is right, but the one I got from the restaurant week booking site was slightly different (15 Haikin Arcade-which google places on the wrong side of Motcomb Street). \u00a0There is an entrance to Haikin Arcade across the street from Waitrose, on Motcomb Street, as well as another entrance on Lowndes Street. \u00a0Just don't be an idiot like me, looking for street sign that says 'arcade', and use the address on Yelp, not '15 Haikin Arcade'.",

    "text": "This was really good, unusual Indian food. \u00a0Think more grilled than saucy, although they do have a couple dishes that we tried that had delicious sauces.My slight hesitation comes from the fact that we had a person in our group who is allergic to peanuts and gluten. \u00a0We chose Indian food because typically Indian food does not use a lot of peanuts or gluten. \u00a0Unfortunately, when we mentioned those allergies to our waiter a lot of consternation ensued because apparently they use peanuts and gluten in a LOT of their dishes. \u00a0I guess they use flour to thicken sauces and put peanuts in a lot of their spices. \u00a0So if you have any allergies, be sure to let them know - maybe even ask before you make your reservation.They eventually produced a menu that indicated which dishes worked and which didn't, but it was a little stressful getting to that point.But if you don't have any food allergies, and have some money to burn on some good Indian food, by all means head to Amaya!",

    "text": "Being Indian, being able to cook Indian food and being experimental about different cuisines, I am not that keen to go to an Indian restaurant when I am eating out. That's the reason I had always been sceptical of going to Amaya. It was expensive and it was Indian food. I used to think - why go there when I can cook curry myself for a fraction of what I would have to shell out at this restaurant?! Boy, how WRONG was I!!!Having lived in London for more than 3yrs now, I can only feel ashamed that yesterday was the first time I went to Amaya. How do I describe it?! Mmmm. Let me try.My friend and I went there for dinner last night (Thursday). The ambience is nice, and upmarket. Well, it being in Knightsbrige, what else can one expect. We were lead to our tables, and given a pretty elaborate drinks and wine menu. I chose Mimosa (Champagne and Orange juice, for the uninitiated) and my friend ordered a glass of rose wine. My drink was very smooth, but wasn't too dilute as well. Next came the dinner menu. We ordered a bunch of stuff - from Venison Kebabs to Fish Tikkas to Lamb. What is surprising about this place is that there isn't much when it comes to gravy-based stuff, and that is a GOOD thing! We also ordered some standard items like daal, rice and bread (naan). With every meal, you also get something called 'Amaya Chutney'. It is basically 4-different items, which are essentially toppings for the stuff you order. These consist of a Plum Chutney, a Tomato Chutney, and two other dry 'powders' - one made of ground roasted peanuts and the other of rose petals and some spices. Trust me, these were one of the best and unique parts about this place. These are so frikkin tasty that it is indescribable!! The food items arrived and man! they were finger-licking delicious!! All the meat-based items melted in your mouth! They had been marinated so well!! All the items were very unique in their tastes, like nothing I had tried before. Even the standard item (daal) tasted very different. Loved the food, and the service was impeccable as well.And I can't finish this never-ending review by not describing the second drink I had. I don't remember what it was called - but it was described as Mojito and Berries in the menu. I am usually not a Mojito person, but I have never tasted a drink like this before. In one word, it was Perfect!! And it had magic pops in it as well!!! These are small crackery substances that 'pop' in your mouth! Phew! I could have drunk a hundred of those Mojitos. You gotta try this Berry Mojito when you go to Amaya!! Anyhow, to sum up, this place IS NOT TO BE MISSED!! The best Indian food I have had in London!",
