Well...the same applies to Pizzeria Santa Maria, which is by far the best Neapolitan Pizza in London! For those who appreciate a cosy environment, where the freshness of the ingredients and the attention to details (i.e. the temperature of the oven, cooking time, the softness of the dough) is paramount, this is the place to be. For those who don't, and probably don't even know the difference between fiordilatte and buffalo mozzarella, well...go to Pizza Express!? :)As a genuine Neapolitan and a great pizza fan, I can tell with no doubts this is the closer to perfection you can get, outside Napoli.",

The Santa Maria guys know what good pizza tastes like because they grew up with it and they're making sure that Londoners now can too. The d\u00e9cor is clean and simple, with art and photos evoking Napoli and a super stylised depiction of a venerated Madonna icon (the Santa Maria di Merino from Vieste, a village near Napoli). Service is warm, friendly and very welcoming. Get here early if you want a table or opt for take-away in one of their cool customised pizza boxes.

If there was a bottle of Lambrusco on the table I probably would have believed I actually was in Naples and not Ealing Broadway. The range of desserts was small, no fuss Italian staples such as gelato and tiramisu, but made up for it by being delicious. The staff were friendly and engaging going around singing and chatting to the customers. These people clearly love what they do and are very good at it. This is one of those places that makes you happy you moved to West London. Well worth the trip out. We have vowed to make it a regular excursion.",

    "text": "As sure as you can be after eating one pizza (and a couple of starters), this place is worth the hype. A tiny little restaurant that doesn't take reservations so can be hard to get seated at peak times. Lots of choice in the menu but all pizzas are kept fairly simple and not overtopped like most takeaways pizza. At 9.95 a pizza, it's a pretty good deal for definitely one of the best pizzas in London.",

    "text": "Santa Maria Pizzeria has long been on my list of pizza joints to try - especially after making the news first for tossing out a couple of girls looking for just a salad (standard.co.uk/news/orde\u2026) and then again when TimeOut and Evening Standard named it the best pizza in London. Santa Maria bills itself as an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria and, with ingredients flown in from Italy, it seems to be just that. The small 16 cover spot usually commands waits of over an hour (it does offer takeaway as an option) and cultivates a cosy caf\u00e9 atmosphere. While it ticks all the boxes for authentic pizza, is it worthy of the best pizza in London? Nope, not for me, as the low prices weren't enough to make up for the relatively plain pizza. I'd prefer to pay a little extra and get a pie from Homeslice or Pizza Lupo.The key thing to note when choosing your pizza is the type of sauce. We opted for a Sant'Anna (a tomato-sauce based pizza) and the San Daniele (a sauce-less pie drizzled with olive oil instead) and there was a marked difference in the taste and experience. The San Daniele was generously topped with parma ham, wild rocket, and shavings of parmesan cheese on a soft pizza base which lends itself to being folded for easy eating. The bold flavours of the ingredients complemented each other although the halved cherry tomatoes seemed a bit of an odd add-on as they didn't stay on the pizza and turned into more of a side dish.In comparison, the Sant'Anna turned into a soggy mess of carbs and flavourless tomato sauce topped with julienned ham. Basically it was a mess to eat and any flavour from the ingredients seemed washed out. A little bit of Google searching later than night resulted in strong recommendations against takeaway for sauce based Neapolitan pizza as the thin pizza wilts quickly in the steamy conditions created by a takeaway box. It would have been nice if Santa Maria had at least warned us about the risk.For \u00a310.95, the San Daniele was a good value option that I'd be happy to go for again. It didn't knock my socks off, but I'd happily have it for a takeaway dinner. The Sant'Anna at \u00a38.95 seemed like a good deal but for takeaway it failed miserably and I'd have been happier with a Tesco sandwich. The tiramisu at \u00a34.25 seemed strangely expensive given the low priced menu and I wouldn't have bothered in hindsight.",

Voted best pizza in London last year by Time Out, I would be shocked to find a better pizza here. Run by Italians, frequented by more Italians. And like in Italy, pizza served with knife and fork. I discovered it Sunday, went back on Tuesday, and again on Friday. I had to put my food down and say not to a request to go there today for fear I'd turn into a pizza. Pretty sure I gained a pound a day last week and so worth it!!The garlic cheese focaccia is excellent, be warned, it's practically a pizza. The aubergine starter, delish. The bruschetta, delish. The tiramisu, do I need to repeat myself? The prices reasonable for the quality and portions. If you were in Italy you'd pay less, but you're in London.The service excellent all 3 times, friendly and prompt. They are pretty serious about their seating but don't believe the pizza nazi hype. Just order a damn pizza and you won't have a problem. If you don't order a pizza you deserve to be scolded!Who knew this very very West suburb of London would be swimming in great restaurants! Lucky me :) Do yourself a favor, pay Ealing a visit and enjoy a pie, you will forget how far you came and wonder why you waited so long.",

    "text": "Way out west in Ealing on St.Mary's is Santa Maria Pizzeria (get the name?). It's the ickle little pizza joint that has the whole of London talking. Time Out's best pizza for 2010? This I had to try.Santa Maria is a pretty place, in a nice part of Ealing with room for about 12 or 14 diners inside and another 8 or so on street tables. Being crowned TO's best pizza means you will often see a queue on the street, and while we were lucky enough to be seated first time, we were hearing other people being told to come back in an hour. Fortunately there's a nice pub next door.So the big question is - how does Santa Maria stack-up against the old London No.1, Franco Manca? Well, in terms of digs - Santa Maria's is much smaller but prettier than FM's Chiswick flagship. Their house wine by the carafe is much better and damn cheap too. Plus they have gorgeous Gelato from Oddonos. But the pizza. THE PIZZA. Oh yes, it's gorgeous, Italian and authentic. A million miles above most London pizzas. But sorry, Franco Manca's still better. It's their sourdough that wins it for FM - just makes the base unstoppably addictive. Plus Santa Maria don't do a capers, olives and anchovy pizza - why not? It's a classic!So Santa Maria: almost as good pizza as Franco Manca, better wine and cuter digs. So close to as good as it gets, and bloody hard to get a table.But not the best pizza in London.",

They do takeaway as well, that can justify the big crew of staff.I went for San Gennaro pizza with anchovies, black olives and capers and also tried my friend's Calzone San Salvatore with prosciutto, mozzarella and ricotta. Both were delicious and juicy with a good portion of tomato sauce spread across the thin dough. Definitely recommended!",

The only 2 negatives I would have to say are that they do not do any bookings & therefore may be waiting a while for a table as it gets very busy. And last thing is that they do not have good quality wine.",

    "text": "This should have been a better experience based on the reviews. It bills itself as authentic Neopolitan pizza, but sadly, does not come close to measuring up. It may be one of the best pizza restaurants in Ealing, but in a blind world, a one-eyed person is king. Waiting is too long. The restaurant makes no effort to move people off once they've finished eating. We waited 45 minutes and watched a precious table of 4 outside get served. \u00a0After our wait and dining -- another 40 min, the foursome was still seated as we left, despite the fact that there was still a line to get in. Management seemed to tolerate their inconsiderate lingering. Service is not very good. We ordered a salad to start, then two appetizers and one pizza. \u00a0The salad never came out. They forgot and apologized. The eggplant app was good, but the 4 meatballs were just ok, and they were the size of marbles. We specifically requested our pizza be baked well-done. What we received was not even close to cooked. It was very doughy, and the cheese was barely melted. So to net it out: \u00a0service & overall experience was not good. \u00a0 Ambiance is crowded, hot and noisy. Food is so-so. Very undeserving of the rating it has.",

I had been keeping my eye on this place through the refurbishment period and to definitely go before I left for the states...glad I did and I might go again!This little charm is perfect in every way...charming knowledgable Italian server, cute and cozy interior, good selection of wine, and the fresh, amazing, delicious pizzas! I had the San Mattia with truffle. Note that there is no red tomato sauce, but who cares!! It's as moist and fresh as it gets!Dessert, homemade Tiramisu of course and to really spruce up your espresso, have it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in it, such a delight!For me, it's not just the food that makes a great dining experience, it's the whole atmosphere and here-you just feel like you are in Italy having divine food!PS- Be prepared to wait up to an hour, but don't let that deter you...go have some wine/beer at the pub next door to wet your appetite, DONE!",

The owners here are extremely proud of their pizza and so they should be. I love the quaintness of the restaurant as well. They could get a bigger place easily judging by the lines for a table outside the door every night but no they want to keep it small and intimate with just enough covers to make the atmosphere great!The only negative I a have is sometime the clientele to hang a little long on these tables. But hey that is the Italian way!Definitely one of the top 5 in London.",

    "text": "Rated by Timeout and London Evening Standard as \"The Best Pizza in London\", we figured we had to give this a try since we were in the area. \u00a0And we needed to know: whats all the buzz surrounding Neapolitan pizza? \u00a0Guess we just don't understand it.. wasn't for me :/ \u00a0A few notes about Neapolitan pizza (for those who don't really know):- usually 1 size, roughly 12\" - base is thin, and the crispy crust has layers of poofiness- served uncut- cooks in a wood oven in about 2 minutes- best enjoyed by eating in. \u00a0Take out will cool the pizza down quickly, steam within the box, and make it soggy- the center is usually a bit soggy / wet- basic / minimal toppings, with a balanced ratio of crust to toppings- toppings are kept simple: fresh mozzarella, basil, oregano, crushed tomatoes, salami.. pretty much back to basics (ie: not Americanized)We did do takeout b/c it was going to be a 45-min wait.. so we broke one of the cardinal rules! \u00a0The pizza definitely was cold after a 5 minute drive. \u00a0The pizza did meet all of the above rules, but maybe the cold pizza dampened the experience. \u00a0But I think even if it was hot, a Neapolitan pizza isn't for me. \u00a0Simple and delicious toppings, yes, but I really can't stand a soggy center, even if the outer crust is beautifully puffy and crispy. \u00a0We also ordered garlic bread, which wasn't garlicky at all. \u00a0I think they might have used garlic powder or a garlic-infused butter / oil for it. \u00a0But either way, it just tasted like salty oregano bread.On the plus side, the price is right for an entire pizza to feed one person, roughly \u00a39.",

    "text": "That's More Like it. After an awful experience at another Ealing independent Pizza restaurant ( Pizza on the Green -http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/pizza-on-the-green-london#query:Pizza%20On%20The%20Green) after not being able to get seated at Santa Maria last month - we made sure we got here early. Even for around 6.30/7pm on a Friday evening, this tiny (and I mean teeny-tiny) restaurant was very lively. It's certainly not a place you would come to for a quiet meal, but a place to come with a (small) group of friends.There were only two waiters, both classically Italian with the lingo, but without the attitude. They coped well, but were very preoccupied. The restaurant is full of rustic old boxes on the walls and hanging garlic and what not - but not too cluttered. Overall it is a very clean and relaxed atmosphere which was great. The Menu is simple. Pizzas, a few starters, good descriptions and there's lots of vegetarian choices. I say that - the V marked pizzas have Parmesan Cheese on them - when I asked if it was 'veggie Parmesan' they said no. So, watch out veggies. Also, if you assume all pizzas come with a tomato based sauce, then you're wrong. They're happy to put it on, but not all pizzas have the classic sauce. I ordered the pizza with courgettes and artichokes and mozzarella. They ingredients were of good quality and the dough was lush. Thin, but not sloppy or too moist. \u00a0 Overall the flavors were very subtle which was great, but I prefer a more powerful taste. Still, a great classic pizza and a nice restaurant. I would give this place 3.5 stars. It is so small (and popular) it's hard to guess when a good time to go would be - and I'm not patient enough to wait. Plus, they do unfortunately lose an entire star for me for not having coke on the menu. I've never been anywhere where I couldn't get a coke with my meal and I was desperate for one (coca cola addict).I'm not saying it's the best pizza in London, but a must in Ealing.",

Nice enough.Service was good, quite alot of staff for such a small room though!We tried the bruschetta, which was good and highly disappointing at the same time: the bread was crunchy and garlicky, but slightly burnt, the tomatoes had boring oregano which did nothing and were blander than bland (good bruschetta does exist!)The pizza was good, soft, chewy, doughy crust, generous toppings, we all agreed there were alot of toppings for your money, just the way it should be. I had the San Mattia which was mushrooms, mountains of Parmesan and truffle oil on a white base. I got extra ham with it, which was thrown into the middle, I think if it was spread out, then it would have got abit crispy in the oven. I ate the lot, I think this is a good representation of a decent pizza from this side of Italy. Tiramisu was good, lots of layers, bit too much alcoholic sponge and not quite enough cream.Overall, I had a good time, would love to see more interesting pizza topping combos though. Worth 50% of the hype but I would love to go again.",
