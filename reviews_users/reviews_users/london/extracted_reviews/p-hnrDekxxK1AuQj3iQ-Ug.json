    "text": "Summary: an English interpretation of a French interpretation of American BBQ.The positives:London needs more BBQ restaurants. So thank you to the proprietors for giving it a go. In fact, just because it's BBQ, I will increase my rating from 2 to 3 stars. Done. The layout and design of the bar area is great: lots of small seating areas, hidden nooks and corners, big windows. All drinks are served \u00a0with a mix of nuts and olives. Call me crazy but I prefer not to mix the sweet and salty nuts in the same jar, but for the \"mix-desert-and-main-course-crowd\" out there it might be appealing. The food:I was part of a very large, very hungry group so we tried a significant portion of the items on the menu. Easily the best thing on the menu were the ribs. An order comes with a combination of large chunky ribs which are a bit chewy and some smaller ribs at the bottom of the jar. The smaller ribs were much more flavourful and benefited from the excess sauce from it's larger brothers. However compared to good southern BBQ style ribs, these ribs deserve a 4.5 out of 10, at best.The pulled pork, lamb, goat (hidden behind the label \"Somerset Kid\") all tasted basically the same and were served with an easily missable side of BBQ sauce. Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were a greasy and flavourless. The Pork chops and rib eye got poor reviews from a fellow diner, chewiness being the main complaint for the steak. The only BBQ-related sauce on the menu was the BBQ sauce mentioned earlier. Any self-respecting BBQ restaurant must offer a variety of tomato and vinegar-based BBQ and hot sauces. If I wanted Bernaise and Peppercorn sauce I could and would go to any standard steak restaurant in London. The Conclusion:Go to the bar, have some free nuts and order some ribs, and you will have covered Blue Boar's best aspects.",

It's a very nice, upscale bar, with a good atmosphere for chatting, but it's incredibly expensive for drinks. I'm not a huge fan of some of the decor, though, like the lamps made of cowboy boots. But some areas aren't too bad; you'll find a lot of nooks and crannies in the various tables and seating available. Go for it if you don't mind the price and it's your taste.",

Our meal was FANTASTIC and was only surpassed by OUTSTANDING service from Ian. Our table had: the ribs appetizer, the sea bass, the fried chicken (2), the kids cheeseburger, the ribeye steak and we shared some asparagus. We all loved our food. The ribs were so very tasty. Ian brought us finger bowels and lots of napkins for the ribs. He even accommodated my iced tea request as well as my son's request for a Caesar salad even though neither was on the menu. Ian was an endearing conversationalist and made us feel so welcome. We were so delighted at the quality of our meal and the attentiveness of our service that I asked to speak to the manager. This place is connected to the InterContinental Hotel but is far from boring tasteless overpriced hotel food. This will rank as one of our best meals.",

    "text": "This is one of those places that makes me wish I could give a zero star review. It was surreal. We were just looking for a comfortable place for our family of five to grab an early dinner...happened upon the Blue Boar on our way back to the hotel. There was a large sign out in front of the restaurant announcing a Sunday Roast available that night. That sounded pretty good so we went in to order. First of all, they acted like they didn't know what to do when a customer actually came in. We were ignored for the longest time. Then when the waiter finally showed up he looked at me as if I had three eyes when I asked for the Sunday Roast. He'd never heard of it, didn't know what it was and announced they didn't have anything like that. I mentioned there was a sign in front of his restaurant promoting it, and he ignored me. We then ordered hummus for the kids from the menu. He said, what is that? FOR REAL. He said they didn't have anything like that. We showed him the menu where it plainly stated Hummus. It all went downhill from there. Very mediocre to down right awful food, horrendous service, WEIRD staff -- it was like we were from another planet. Please stay away from this poor excuse for a restaurant. The only silver lining is that the whole family still is having a good laugh at the expense of the Blue Boar -- when considering a new restaurant now we always say, \"Well, it can't be as bad as the Blue Boar!\" And it is true, nothing can compare to this craphole.",

We both fancied the old fashioned and boy do they do a mighty fine one! It was more orangey than I'm used to, but I really liked it, especially with the cherry which sat on the top of the ice!

Service was good, and the prices were good considering it was in the hotel.

I had the burger, and the best part of it was the toasted bun (brioche). The burger meat reminded me of something like GBK, not cheap but cheerful. The chips were thin-cut and sparse, served in a metal dish which conducted away their heat. There wasn't anything to complain about, but nothing to shout about either. One of my companions had the sea bass, which got better feedback.I ended on sticky toffee pudding, and found it very rich (but not overwhelmingly so), and the honeycomb ice cream went well with it.In all, the food was perfectly edible, but for the price and the availability of the Caxton Grill 2 minutes up the road, not somewhere I can recommend.",

My date finished off most of his burger.. I tried a bite, but to be honest, I was too full to pay much attention to it! \u00a0I like my patties cooked medium rare so its nice and juicy, but I *think* the patty was well done..? \u00a0If burgers are your thing, then by all means you should try it, but I think there are several other burger establishments which serve up a meaner burger.With whatever room we had left, we rolled on over to the dessert table, which was splashed with 3-4 different types of macarons, cakes, tarts, elderflower creme brulee, strawberry mousse, GIANT meringues with assorted fruits... I can't remember it all, but there's something for everyone, especially if you have a sweet tooth. Overall, I had a fantastic time at the restaurant, the servers were nice, but the highlight really was the guy playing his guitar and singing at the entrance of the restaurant. \u00a0It was seriously a nice surprise, and I kept getting distracted by all the songs he kept playing. \u00a0He takes requests too!At \u00a335/person for an unlimited boozy brunch with some great music on the side, I say this is a win.",

It was just the after work crowd. We were greeted warmly and given a prime table near the front windows. This is a very nicely decorated place. Looks very new, bright and the front is all windows. I had a very good homemade soup of the day and braised Ox cheek. My girlfriend had the chicken in a basket. Which is a half fried chicken and chips. It was cooked perfectly. A little warning though, it was quite spicy. My girlfriend said that her lips were burning. My Ox cheek was very good and so tender. They gave me a steak knife to cut it with but I just pulled it apart with my fork. It tasted better than the best pot roast that I have ever had.I can highly recommend this restaurant. Something to keep in mind is, that culturally they are not quick to bring you the bill even if they \u00a0know that you have finished. They don't want anyone to think that they are rushing you out of the restaurant. So you may have to flag them down and specifically ask for the check. They are not trying to be rude.",

    "text": "For me brunch means breakfast and lunch foods mixed with copious amounts of booze. So when I find a place that advertises brunch with unlimited Bloody Marys and Mimosas (that's Buck's Fizz to you Brits), I'm willing to give it a go.When I booked it, it was \u00a350 per person, but they lowered the price recently to \u00a335. Which was really an added bonus. I don't know if it's a permanent change, but it's well worth the price either way. We were slightly concerned showing up that the \"unlimited\" wouldn't be as unlimited as we often like (you know, so you're drinking enough for two), but we were pleasantly surprised when we saw the drinks were sitting near the buffet to be picked up whenever you wanted another one. That's a +1 star right there! Also on the way in there was a man playing soft rock and hits from Glee on his guitar which really added a special feeling to the day (especially when you've had enough booze to start singing along).How it works: There is a buffet set up with salads, shellfish and meats. There were five pre-made salads and a \"make-your-own\" caesar salad station. (Which sounds and looks cool, but it's a lot of work, I'd probably prefer having a premade caesar for ease.) Most of the stuff on the buffet was pretty awesome, especially the sliced meats available. There were also plenty of prawns and cold shellfish to go around.Once you're full up on the buffet, they bring you rmains around. You've ordered these when you've arrived with a few sides to share. Now you're quite full, but you tuck in anyway because the food is fantastic. I had the trio of eggs. Basically three different egg benedicts. And they were all tasty. But I couldn't finish. The smokehouse does barbeque, so two people ordered that. There was a pulled pork (which looked fantastic) and these amazingly delicious smoked pork ribs served in a silver bucket (I tried one, and they were luscious.) The next table over had the roast (which that day was beef) and it was served perfectly medium rare and also looked fantastic.At this point you've had a lot to drink and eat and you're stuffed. But there's an entire table of desserts as well. With things ranging from macarons to cheesecakes to chocolate pots and creme brulee. There are so many desserts and they look so amazing that you want to try them all. But you're stuffed. But you try anyway. And many of them are good. They weren't all amazing (even if they look it) which is probably why it only gets four stars.Will I be back? Yes most definitely. I might even try it for dinner. The barbeque was amazing, even if it was served in a place that looked way too upscale to be serving ribs and pulled pork.",

    "text": "Fantastic location, even better drinks. Had the opportunity to try the Blue Boar while staying at the Conrad on vacation. The inside was new and refreshing. The wait staff were superb. The Blue Boar caters to the after work crowd and is decorated with various political caricatures. We brought our daughter for a glass of lemonade while we waited for our taxi to Paddington (she was the only child in the location). Carlos, the manager, drew pictures with my daughter and magically appeared with a box of crayons to color in the pictures. If you want to impress a five year old bring her a box of crayons. This is a great location and I highly recommend it to anyone that is fortunate enough to find themselves in Westminster.",

I was put off when the restaurant called me asking for a credit card to confirm and stated we would have to pay \u00a340 each if we cancelled. \u00a0Normally that is stated on most websites and by Open Table but I went with it. \u00a0When we showed up to the restaurant we were shocked and disappointed to hear it was buffet only. \u00a0Not a fan of buffets!The buffet was horrendous! \u00a0Everything was cold and dried out. \u00a0Nothing was representative from their menu. \u00a0It was like the horrible family buffet I've dreaded all my life...bland turkey, over cooked ham, chunky potatoes that could have been used as hockey pucks. \u00a0Very disappointing! \u00a0We choked down of few pieces, closed our tab and moved to their separate bar. \u00a0The bartenders nearly made up for the horrible dinner.I might give them a chance next time I am in London to see if their regular menu is worth the decent reviews they have on Yelp.",

A new BBQ restaurant that I'd never heard of?! Hmmm. I was a bit unsure, after reading some reviews trashing their service but decided to give it a go.The service, I can safely say, was wonderful. Our servers were all lovely. The quality of the food...well, there was nothing WRONG with it, it was fine, but I'd say overpriced for what was definitely \u00a0not authentic American BBQ, as advertised. I had the pulled lamb, my co-diners had pulled pork and the pork belly. The pork and lamb just weren't spicy enough and the pork belly was over salty with not a lot of other flavours prevalent. \u00a0It's also officially the first time I've eaten BBQ from pure silver serving bowls and trays--my family would undoubtedly get a kick out of seeing such an informal food being served in such a formal way.You can get much better BBQ for a lot less of the price at other places. The only redeeming feature, aside from the service, was the fact that the hotel was absolutely lovely.",

We checked out the menu outside and decided to give Blue Boar a try. The inside is super cute and modern. The bathrooms are luxurious. I didn't realize it was attached to a hotel, but everything inside was great! The reason we were confused was because the fanciness and upscale feel did not match menu prices at all, so we felt like we struck gold. My friend and I decided to share their \"British sampler\" (can't remember the exact name) which is made for two people. It came in a picnic basket displayed absolutely beautifully. It came with a scotch egg, pickled veggies, tuna, bread, apples, finger sandwiches, ham, a whole fruit/cheese/cracker plate AND a berry pudding dessert. We were super impressed and everything tasted great. The best part is it was only 25 pounds, or about $30 USD, which is not bad at all for two people and the amount of food we got. My ONLY complaint was service was slow. Would definitely come back here if I find myself in London again!",

We ordered water to drink and it took them 11 minutes to bring that over, and it was only after we asked them again for it. May I add we were one of three tables in the entire place. We ordered the ham and cheese toastie and roast beef sandwich. Toastie came out with greasy cheese and rubbery- like it had been sitting out for a while, and they forgot the crisps (had to ask for them). Roast beef was okay, nothing special.

How is it discretionary if it's already printed on my bill? So, I was forced to tip them for a sub-standard meal and average service. oh, but if you're in the holiday spirit and want to tip them more than the mandatory 12.5%, they graciously leave a giant line on the bill for you to write in an additional tip. Ridiculous. Avoid this place.",

I showed up at 6:30 and got a table right away. The atmosphere is amazing. You're not dining on top of other people, there is a ton of space. It's super clean and the service was amazing. A little pricy but all things considering I'm surprised it's not more expensive. I got their signature burger which came with fries. Honestly, it was a good burger. Thick with fresh toppings and was cooked perfectly. They brought it to me hot hot hot. My first bit I nearly had to spit back out cuz it was so hot. The bun may have been the best thing about the burger. Again, I can't say enough about this place. It's quiet so conversations are enjoyable.",

    "text": "Went here for Christmas Lunch. The meal was a five course meal and we also ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate. Overall the meal quality was disappointing for the price. Some of the chefs creations (particularly this beef thing rolled in some sort of chalky vegetable to simulate a Yule log I believe) were inappropriate pairings that didn't make sense. Pros: The desserts on the other hand that they had prepared were beautiful. In fact, I've never seen a desert table quite like the one they had prepared. So much beautiful food, taste was still okay, but it was beautiful. Cons: In addition to the items above, the service was actually overly attentive. In fact it was on the intrusive side. Countless times mid conversation we were interrupted.",

Even the manager just looked at us. Then we had to grab someone who seemed annoyed to have to take our drink order. Another 10 minutes for it to be brought over. Then my drink was a single bourbon which they insisted was a double. Not even close. For 11 euros. Had no intention of making sure I was a satisfied customer. So the service was rotten and I won't go back.",
