The reason I give the mains only 3.5 stars is that the salads both had fairly bland dressings and needed something tangier to finish them. \u00a0I found myself adding more salt and pepper than I normally would, to bring out more flavor.The bottle of Languedoc red was very good.Dessert - I was glad for my decision to have two salads and save room for dessert! \u00a0I actually ordered poached pears with ginger ice cream. \u00a0They were delicious and the ice cream was just right. \u00a0Since we were sharing a bit, I asked for a bite of my companions cheesecake. \u00a0OK, if you like bananas, caramel and peanut flavors together, this is a genuine mouth orgasm-producing dessert. \u00a0So very very yummy. \u00a0I would go back just for this (And thank you Fred for letting me have two extra bites).Will definitely return on another trip across the pond.",

Overall, the place has potential. \u00a0It's a touch Sloaney, so I hope that gets toned down with time. \u00a0Otherwise, the food was definitely the redeeming factor, albeit a little overpriced. \u00a0They're debuting Sunday roast and breakfast in January. \u00a0I pray the breakfast is decent, and that the fireplace works. \u00a0I could definitely make this a neighborhood standard.",

Atmosphere was great, with what looks like an old feel with what looks like new wooden bar and weathered tables, as well as my favorite old-school Edison lighting. We went for Sunday roast, and the roast was delicious! The cocktails were superb, expertly recommended by an attentive staff, who were not in your business the entire meal, but right on top of it if you needed another drink. We got the chili squid which was perfectly cooked; my pork chop was amazing, and my husband's roast beef was a good portion with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. I would've gone back again and again if we had stayed in town longer. We went on a Sunday evening without reservations and were ale to be seated without issue. Highly recommended!!",

I originally considered getting the Rioja, and the waitress gave me a bit to try, which I thought very generous. They also have a variety of beers on tap and behind the bar, as the happy hour crowds can attest to. For eats, I had a really great plate of fish and chips with mushy peas. Perhaps it's not an original, but it was very well-executed. Actually, the same can be said for the entire restaurant. Good, solid, tasty food.",

From the country-chic charming ambience to friendly and attentive wait staff, it completely changed my mind about English cuisine.We had a beetroot starter, cured scallop dish, crayfish salad and fish & chips. Everything was fresh and delicately prepared- seasoned and dressed perfectly with layers of textures. Fish and chips were excellent- they were a posh version of the classic, served with a lemon wedge, tartar sauce and mashed green peas- might be the best we've had in London. The cocktails (pilco sour, G&T) were unique, also made with fresh ingredients and not with mixers. We'll definitely come back on our next visit to London.",

I am torn between the classic gravy and the red wine reduction sauces as my favorite. \u00a0 They also have a great selection of cocktails, wine, beer, and whiskey. My recommendations are the mint julep or the mojito if your seeking something fresh. Also, let's be honest one can't go wrong with a good bourbon or rum cocktail. I recommend making reservations in advance. They get packed quickly in the evening between 6-8pm. Of the two meals I have had there, I am yet to have room for dessert so stay tuned for an update.

    "text": "WARNING - BEWARE, I would avoid at all costs!! \u00a0I dined and stayed at their hotel. \u00a0I'd give this place zero stars if I could. \u00a0To sum it up, I got violently ill after dining here and the process and the final resolution was absolutely appalling. \u00a0Arriving at Heathrow in the evening and starving, we came directly to the hotel to check-in. \u00a0To keep things simple, we decided to dine in the restaurant as well. \u00a0The food was ok, not great, but I was too hungry to care, it was just sustenance at this point. \u00a0I did however, feel the rabbit dish was a bit off; the rhubarb and the rabbit loin - seemed off (went bad kind of off) and texture as well, so much so that I stopped eating it. \u00a0And to note, if you are wondering, I did not drink one drop of alcohol. \u00a0Before even finishing our dessert, I was feeling a bit unwell soon after the last course and left to go upstairs to the room as my husband handled the check. \u00a0I attributed it to just being tired from having a super early morning and a long flight from New York, but now in reflection, I think it was an immediate reaction to the food.I cleaned up, felt off, but forced myself to bed. \u00a0I woke an hour or so later in a cold sweat and felt extremely nauseated. \u00a0I could feel my stomach rolling as if an alien being had invaded my body, but wanting to get out. \u00a0I was moaning and having a hard time breathing; I felt so ill, at one point if I didn't feel better soon, I was going to ask my husband to take me to the ER; I felt like I was going to die. \u00a0Then suddenly and violently, my body shot straight up from a lying position and I involuntarily let out a giant dry heave. \u00a0I promptly got up and I was in the bathroom throwing up for 4 to 5 times, with periods in between dry heaving and crying in pain as my body was trying to get rid of whatever toxic thing I ingested. \u00a0This went on for several hours, then came a point where I finally felt some relief as if I went through an exorcism and stumbled back to bed. \u00a0 My husband was also sick from the food, but did not go through anything compared to what happened to me. \u00a0This was how my first day of our two week vacation began in Europe. \u00a0Days after, I was still nauseated and could only eat bland food (i.e. crackers/bread) and only a nibble here and there. \u00a0It was hard to even put down water. \u00a0It wasn't how I expected our vacation to begin. \u00a0My husband discussed what happened to the person that assisted us during check out, and as a starting point, mentioned that the rabbit dish seemed a bit off and possibly the culprit. \u00a0He seemed ambivalent and answered,\"we will investigate and email you.\" \u00a0Two days later, we get another email from the manager stating that he was away the past two days and he will also \"investigate and email later.\" \u00a0A week from the incident, the response was merely evidence to defend that the rabbit was cooked properly, stating the date of arrival of the rabbit, the method of cooking and the different temperatures it was cooked at. \u00a0So, basically, sorry not sorry. \u00a0We mentioned the rabbit dish as a starting point for them to look into the matter, but that was their only focus. \u00a0There is more to what temperature the rabbit is cooked at that can cause issues; poor handling, a dirty plate/utensil/cup, poorly washed vegetables (we had several salads and vegetable sides as well - people have gotten sick from spinach, lettuce, I could go on), dirty hands from cooks, servers etc., e. coli and other nasty bacteria, you name it - if things are not handled well or there are issues with the produce/meat vendors - people can get sick and violently sick. The consolation prize, he wanted to offer a bottle of champagne upon our return. \u00a0WTF?! \u00a0You think I would come back after this happened to me, no f'ing way. \u00a0We had a two night stay here after our return from France and I cancelled it right after that night. \u00a0There was no way I would EVER EVER EVER return to this establishment.From their slow and clearly lack of concern and accountability on how someone that dined at their establishment got violently ill, I'd recommend avoiding this place. \u00a0Since they didn't really \"investigate,\" this could happen again. \u00a0Whatever is going on is still going on and inevitably someone else will get sick. \u00a0As for their hotel, it looks cute from first glance, but it's all show and doesn't deliver.1. We found brown stained sheets on the bed with bits of brown debris, which at first we thought were bugs - gross. 2. Noisy - thin walls/floors/windows plus construction across the street at the time we were there.3. Lumpy bed and pillows.4. Toothpaste splatter all over the wood walls in the bathroom.5. No AC (ceiling fan and plug-in fan to keep the room cool) - I can't imagine staying here during the summer.6. Tiny sink - when you wash your hands or try washing your face, water gets all over the floor.7. Safe didn't work - it was broken, locked up and we were given a physical key to lock and unlock it.",

    "text": "Our first night in town, jet lagged and trying our hardest to stay awake, we managed to find this adorable gastropub. We had previously made reservations online, so we were slightly dismayed when we were taken away from the hustle and bustle of the first floor bar and taken to the more sedate upstairs. Regardless, the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. Rustic decor (think antler chandeliers) and great smells emanated throughout the restaurant.Our server was a small, sassy man who seemed initially friendly, but when he found out I wouldn't be drinking due to pregnancy, he was distinctly brusque towards me for the remainder of our dinner. \u00a0He literally tried to upsell us on an additional course or drink every time he came to our table, though he didn't refill my water very often. Loved my drinking husband, though!We started with a half-dozen colchester oysters for my husband and the salt and pepper squid for me. Both were absolutely delicious. The aioli that came with the squid was flavorful and the citrus on the squid was noticeable. For mains, I had the chicken and Jerusalem artichoke salad while my husband had the pork chop off the grill. We also split the Brussel sprouts for a side - these were the star of the dinner. Everything was exactly what we wanted - I did think it was strange that the soft-boiled egg on my salad was cold, but it all worked perfectly. The sprouts actually put us into the \"massively full\" range, so no need for dessert.The food was fun, tasty, and trendy. We would eat at The Grazing Goat again in a heartbeat, though I would ask to sit in a different server's section - more food, less snark!",

We had questions and she \"patiently\" answered all of our queries with a smile. I ordered the market fish with a side salad and a glass of wine.

Atmosphere was very nice.....and yes it does get noisy as the evening goes on. Guess that proved that EVERYONE was happy!!",

This British Sunday staple - roast beef, potatoes, mashed turnips, carrots and Yorkshire pudding, drizzled with gravy - was superb! I've seen other reviews complaining about slow service. If you are from the US, it may seem slow, but it's not. Slow down, and enjoy a drink and good company, make new friends, and your meal will be served before you know it. My servers were attentive and very friendly. \u00a0The Goat is located in the are just north of Marble Arch, very near the western end of the Oxford Street shopping area. The atmosphere here, however, is quieter and more low key. Surrounded by boutique shops and upscale homes, this is a hidden gem.

All perfectly fine. Portions are very generous so you won't leave hungry and would be fine with one or two courses. Not a great fan of the desserts. The coffee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e did not come with the requisite crispy, sugary lid although the accompanying shortbread biscuits and honeycomb ice-cream were good (example of how generous the portions are!). The caramelised apple tart is oddly deconstructed: a small, caramelised apple sitting atop a disc of pastry. Jury's out on whether it classifies as a 'tart'Service seems to be more friendly downstairs in the pub area -- where tables are available to eat at, same menu -- then upstairs in the restaurant area.I prefer the food at the Thomas Cubbitt, sister pub in Belgravia.",

I can't believe how smooth and creamy the goat curd was. The combination of flavors was so nice. I ordered the pork chop with mashed potatoes which was just good. The apple sauce was like chutney and the crackling (?) was first for me. It seemed really hard, thin bacon. Me mates had two different pies . The vegetarian was okay, but the chicken pie was really good. That was my first choice but I decided to go with the pork chop to compare with Great Queen Street. For dessert we had the cake with pears, caramel and ice cream. So tiny yet so delicious. All four are served separate on the same plate. But if you take a bit of each at once, it can be oh so heavenly. We got the board of cheeses as well. Really, really small with some grapes, apple slices, crackers, fig, and apple jelly. I can't remember what wine we had it with, but it was nice. We closed down the place at 11:40 PM. Last meal order is at 10:00, last dessert order at 10:30 PM, and last drink order at 10:45 PM.

Not to mention, a very cool name, totally fits the ambiance! We started with the battered squid served with sweet chili sauce. Now this is a classic you can get at a million different places a million different ways, but let me tell you, this one blew my mind. the squid was tender, the batter was perfect and not greasy, seasoned lightly, and the sweet chili sauce was absolutely on point. But the fun doesn't stop there! I got the saddle of rabbit as my main course, and holy smokes, what a treat. Not only was the plate beautiful, with a perfect balance of sauce, meat, veggies, and garnish, but the flavours and textures were incredible. The meat was juicy and tender, served as a bacon wrapped saddle and also as a \"leg meat croquette\", with a delicious squash? based sauce and fresh vegetables. In fact it was so delicious I don't even remember what my friend had (well, I do, it was fish and chips, but I that's boring so I won't talk about it). To wrap things up we shared a cheese platter, which was absolutely on point with variety and flavor profile. While this meal was certainly expensive, the food stood for itself and in comparison to the rest of London, it fits appropriately. I would definitely come here again!",

The waiters were very nice and attentive. If you are into whiskey or scout they have a good selection. By my surprise the made a decent margarita. Just one tip: margaritas belong in a tall glass. Let's talk fish-n-chips: The fish was cooked and battered perfectly. Not soggy at all and a good batter to fish ratio. The chips were a little thinker than I would like but with ketchup they are fine. I like this place.",

It was minutes from Oxford street and it seemed like many locals dined here.We started off with dinner-a dozen of Dungarvan oysters which were delish. We then shared an entr\u00e9e of fish and chips and a dried rubbed ribeye, mushy peas, rosemary mashed potatoes and a bone marrow a jus. Everything was tasty and the bone marrow a jus was outstanding. I enjoyed my English meal with a pint of Guinness which was surprisingly good. For dessert, we indulged in the Sticky ginger pudding, pears and ice cream which was awesome!Service from our waitress who was from Spain was friendly and I really enjoyed her English accent! I would certainly return here again or recommend the Grazing Goat which also has hotel rooms upstairs to rent by the night!",

A gastro pub, this place does a fine job of carrying a decent but underwhelming selection of ales, beers, ciders, wines and spirits. The menu isn't for everyone but if the mains don't inspire you, starters like salted squid and French fries might do the trick. The place is clean and doesn't smell like a traditional pub, which is of course because it isn't one. I can recommend it for meeting up with friends but it can get a bit loud as they fit a lot of tables in a tight space. Last comment, this is an expensive place for what you get. A pint and a bowl of nuts will run you almost \u00a38.",

The salt squid was very good in terms of seasoning but the scallops as a starter was a bit disappointing, only 2 tiny scallops, bit of a rip off.Ordered the large ribeye with triple cooked chips and peppercorn sauce. The steak was actually cooked well but it was served with some BBQ sauce. When the right sauce finally came, there was no more steak. And the chips; triple cooked? More like 1/2 cooked.For dessert, the baked Alaska, good attempt at the dessert but the ratio of meringue to ice cream was slightly off, so you had plenty of super sweet meringue.All in all it was a pleasant experience but I can't say I'll be rushing back for the food anytime soon.",

The Grazing Goat fit the bill perfectly. It's probably the first time I've been in a pub at 9am, but this was definitely on the gastro side of pubs, so didn't feel weird. There were plenty of other people at 9am, but it wasn't so rammed that we had any trouble finding a seat. The menu is pretty typical London breakfast at the minute-- fancy granola, avocado on toast, English breakfast. Didn't have a listing for a veggie version of English breakfast, or I'd have been tempted. I got the yogurt and granola, another person got the smoked salmon on rye toast. In terms of value, I think I won, with a huge portion of really thick yogurt and tasty granola, where he had a pretty small piece of toast with some salmon. Food was decent, service was OK, if you're in the area and need a breakfast option, this is solid.",

I had been recommended this venue by some colleagues and the name sounded really light-hearted and fun, so thought I'd give it a go.We opted for mains and deserts. I had the butternut dumplings which I thought would be a rustic take on gnocchi but looked wonderfully elegant and was delicately flavoured. I'd definitely order this again. My friend's burger was presented on a wooden board (how very gastro-pub!) and tasted good too. You can't really go wrong with a cheeseburger and chunky fries.The crumble, which is the desert I really wanted, was apparently also very yummy, but due to being allergic to most of the deserts menu, I had to settle for the Eton mess myself. However, it wasn't messy at all - the fruit was hidden under one perfectly shaped dome of meringue and it was a very high-class take on a British classic. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Photographs are probably necessary to convey how great the food was but we couldn't wait to tuck in.The bill (including service) came to \u00a368 for two people for two courses and a glass of wine each. You could have a similar meal elsewhere for cheaper, but each course was absolutely lovely and I was very happy to pay at those price points for what we received. A star comes off for the slow service (the waiters were lovely when we caught their attention, but it was difficult to do so) and the limited desert options for nut allergy sufferers. Taste-wise it was perfect though.",

I was tired at the time, so I thoroughly enjoyed being sat upstairs. If you're into the party social scene, definitely sit downstairs.The food was incredible, and the beer list seemed legit. I think the reason for the service mishap was the fact that I was alone, and there was another party who was unhappy with their meal, and then more tables were sat with bigger parties.

As former London residents, we can say that this is one of the best meals we've had in the city full stop. There is an inordinate amount of attention paid to flavors and quality of food, and the meals are creative and interesting without being pretentious or inaccessible. We had the buratta to start, which was lovely and complex. From there, my husband had the burger (a solid A-), and I had the chicken and bacon pie, which was a total showstopper. I'm generally not even really a fan of meat pies, but decided to take a gamble on this one and it paid off. Eating it was basically a religious experience. Paired with a glass of chianti, it was a perfect meal. Absolutely on our list when the next time we're here!",

Great.About 20 minutes later, a bunless burger comes out. The brioche bun had milk in it, and so it had been removed, along with the cheese.It would have been nice to be told this before the food came out - I would have probably picked something else.I was offered some rye toast on the side instead, which I accepted. The waiter then asked if I wanted any butter on it...The burger itself was nothing special. There was 2 or 3 large bits of gristle which actually felt like I was crunching on bone. Cue the graceful removal from my mouth to the side of my plate.In all, not the best experience, especially for anyone with a food intolerance! It also took about ten minutes after I'd finished eating to grab the attention of a waiter for the bill, despite there being only about 8 people dining.Finally, the Yelp two \u00a3\u00a3's made me think this place was cheaper than it actually was. In all with tip it came to \u00a320 for a burger and a Coke which is pretty pricey for a simple lunch which isn't too special!",

Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was visiting Britain for the first time... so... FOOD- All I wanted was something comforting. I think I was chanting those words over and over as we walked to this spot. After 5 weeks abroad eating strange foods, I just wanted something simple and delicious and comforting. AND I GOT IT. Ahhhh man. The food here was perfect. I had the meat pie and it was perfect for me. I also had a pea and ham soup that brought tears to my eyes. The apple pie dessert felt like I was close to my mother's house and anyway, yeah. Maybe it's cause I was in Italy for 5 weeks and so fed up with pasta, but this place hit the spot. We came twice in three nights and ordered the same items both times.DRINKS- The cocktails were pretty good. I wouldn't write home about any except the London Cup which was refreshing and pleasant. The rest were worth what we paid and we left satisfied and boozed up.SERVICE- A bit hit or miss, but never too bad. We came once at 8PM and service was flawless. Then we came once at 6PM and it was rushed and not very attentive but we didn't worry about it too much.AMBIANCE- Look, I don't know what other London pubs are like, but this place was nice. Our \"british pubs\" where I live are divey as hell. This was upper scale but comfy.We will come back and definitely make a stop here. Absolutely loved it.",

Even though we know London is a big place with plenty of options, we found this particular restaurant appealing to us. Especially because of their Sunday roasts.When we arrived, the hostess asked us if we had a reservation. We didn't, but she was kind enough to get us a table rather quickly. Once we were seated we got menus immediately. Notably, it took a while for our server to make first contact (which he acknowledged and apologized for).With a recommendation on which Sunday roast is best we placed our orders. The first thing we got pretty quickly was our cocktails (the Posh Goat). The cocktails were very good!Maybe 10 minutes after, we got our appetizer of Cornish mussels. Those were good, although a few didn't open. Then, maybe 10 minutes after that, we got both our order of rib beef and pork Sunday roast main dishes. The pork, with the apple sauce, was delicious, but the pork skin was very tough to chew (I had to leave most of it). The rib beef sauce was great, but the beef itself was a bit dry. We ordered a dessert, the Bramely apple pie that was very delicious.Overall, great service and cocktails. Just good enough on the Sunday roast.",

The flavors were good but the price was exorbitant to me \u00a0We each got a version of the Sunday Roast. I got the beef version. The portion was reasonable and with the veggies and Yorkshire pudding, a reasonable meal. \u00a0Probably about right at 22 pounds each. The service was friendly and loved the atmosphere despite it being a bit warm. Would recommend the place but it is spendy for what you get.",

I had been there so long at this point I had already decided on everything I wanted to eat, although I was still without any service. I ordered a beer with my meal. 23 minutes later (for real) my soup came, but still no beer. I could see my beer on the bar for at least 10 minutes with the waiter just walking back and forth, ignoring me, but taking the time to flirt repeatedly with a table of young women. when the soup came, brought by the host (owner?) I said I was still waiting for my beer and he found it on the bar and brought itthe soup was okay. potato leek with fish and bacon. a little bland, I added a lot of pepper. for the main I ordered the chicken and ham hock pie which was okay. just okay.I couldn't wait to leave since, at this point, I had been there over an hour. prices were \u00a0reasonable.oh, and there are 8 or so outdoor tables, which are nice. but, the windows to the dining room were large and opened, so all the cigarette smoke from the people outside blew into the restaurant. I was seated by the window and there was a guy sitting at the table directly outside smoking. he might have well been inside sitting next to me. it would have been the same experience.so...never going back",

    "text": "3 of us just had dinner here and it was the best meal of our trip to London so far. Two of us both ordered the 1/2 roast chicken with wild mushroom gravy (you have a choice of 4 or 5 gravies), bacon and sage stuffing, and sour cream/chive mashed potatoes. The chicken was great all by itself - crispy skin, tender juicy meat, great flavor. \u00a0With the addition of the wild mushroom gravy, heaven!! The mashed potatoes had great flavor and texture, but the highlight may have been the stuffing. Rather than just a lump of soggy bread, these were formed into small pancakes and pan sauteed until crisp on the outside and tender in the middle.Our third diner chose the veal served with polenta, spinach, and artichokes. Beautifully presented, the veal was melt-in-your-mouth tender and full of flavor. All of the sides were equally good. We highly recommend both of these dishes.Everyone's favorite dessert was the plum and almond cake. A wonderful little almond cake topped with a plum sauce, served with some vanilla custard and a small scoop of chocolate sorbet. Again, a beautiful presentation that tasted every bit as good as it looked.I was so focused on the food that I nearly forgot to mention the excellent service, friendly staff, and attractive dining room.",

Heard the name rattled about at work a few times so thought I'd try given I was sort of nearby. The place was fairly quiet when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. Started out just as drinks but ended up staying for dinner.. Had the chilli squid for starter and the seared beef salad as a main. Partner had the burger, friends had the fish n chips, scallops and mackerel salad. All pretty standard fare, although my friend thought the scallops were fab. Overall, it was ok...but just ok. Think if I'd stumbled upon it randomly, I might be more inclined to be more favorable, but it being called a gastopub is a bit generous I thought. It was just a nice pub to me.",

It took a while for us to get our bill and we felt a bit taken for granted. \u00a0Overall passable, but there are other Sunday roasts in London which we prefer.",

We didn't have room or dessert, so we'll need to save that for next time.",

So when BFF told me they had a sister venue in Marble Arch, I was all ears (and stomach...). It was one of those chillax Saturdays, the weather was great, we were looking for a nice terrace to rest our feet, get healthy food and a glass of wine. The placed aced all of the requirements... Unfortunately, we arrived too late for breakfast (and that's a thing that could probably be improved, as 11.30 remains quite early to stop serving breakfast on a Saturday...) so we decided to go for a salad (prawn for her, chicken for me), yummy yummy! We had a lovely Cote de Provence (in the sun, what else??) to go with it and service was as impeccable as friendly... My heart stays with the Orange, but little sister is on a very good way!",

And the pork belly was the best app. I am already dying for another trip across the pond and we hope to stay at the adjoining hotel in order to be even closer to the best food in town. You can not go wrong at this restaurant and the service was great, even on super busy nights! I highly recommend.",

It's a pleasant warming d\u00e9cor, and the staff are generally very nice. I had a very late Sunday Lunch here and Breakfast the next day.First experience was very positive; we booked a table about an hour before hand and went to dump our stuff at the nearby residence. When we returned they remembered and welcomed us with a smile. Downstairs area is first come first served, and they only take reservations for upstairs - it was a Sunday, but we didn't want to take the risk so we booked.The menu is half gastro pub half brasserie, but we couldn't see past the Sunday Roast - Two Roast Beef please! We were served by the supervisor who was knowledgeable about his wines and the property and we enjoyed talking to him about the company. Part of a small group of 4 properties, they seem to have got the formula spot on!We had a bottle of Bordeaux, which was lighter than we would have hoped for, but still a nice drop. And the food came quickly, nice and pink in the middle - Yorkies had obviously been cooked some time ago as they were dry and hard, but otherwise the food was good. Coffee and Chocolate Cake to share and we were complete! I should add that the service throughout was very attentive and non obtrusive.Breakfast was fine, I had 2 eggs benny, a double espresso and freshly squeezed OJ, came to around \u00a315. \u00a0Service was prompt, but the guy was another one of those great London waiters who can't do eye contact - I think these guys must all have very dark histories... Though it was a beautiful day and it was a very good start to another day full of adventure!",

Beautiful place, oldy worldy with a touch of modernism (yes, that is the technical interior decorators term for it) and boy did that room fill up quickly.Quick tip: Book or turn up early in order to get a table!The food is a little on the pricey side for a working lunch, around \u00a316 a main, but the quality is well worth it.

The guests were looking at me wondering out loud why I was eating fish and chips here. That made me feel very self conscious and more uncomfortable. I was wrapping up my meal and the waitress could not understand that I was asking to pay for my meal so I can leave as quickly as possible. Eventually everything worked out and I left. If it wasn't so crowded and stiffling and if the waitress could understand when I told her I want to pay and leave I would have given a 4 star review.
