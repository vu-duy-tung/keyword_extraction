Two fried eggs, spanish chorizo style sausage, lightly fried potatoes, bacon and toast. The service was a little slow, but the waitress apologised so much afterwards and the food was definitely worth the wait. This would be a great place to hang out for a lazy brunch. There's lot of space and because it's away from the main King's Cross drag & off the beaten track from tourists, I imagine it would be reasonably easy to get a seat at weekends.",

    "text": "\"Camino\" ... this word sounds like the Hindi word meaning rascals ... :) ... so i had a chuckle when i first heard where we would be going for the Spanish dinner ... the third stop in our world tour.The place is very large and well decorated ... with a long bar. But they didn't have a table big enough for the 12 of us and so we had to split into two groups.The table i was in decided to order just alcohol and tapas ... many of them. So we tried a blend of very different food items interspaced with gulps of some great sangria. I especially liked the potato, the small sausages and the prawn. Since i had come late, i ordered late ... and my order was the most weird looking dish that i could find in my short perusal of the menu. So the last item to arrive on the table was black rice with cuttlefish and squid ink (no idea what that is). But it tasted really good. The cuttlefish looked like mussels (or were they mussels ... don't know for sure :p). We rounded up the meal with dessert, with me having 3 scoops of some delicious vanilla. At \u00a318 / head excluding the drinks, it is a very reasonable place to go to in an area pretty much devoid of good eateries.",

Well located in King's Cross this is a popular spot for the office workers of the locality who are after post-work drinking without a bus fare to Islington; it serves the purpose tolerably well with lots of space and an appealing vibe. The \u00a315 house ros\u00e9 we sampled was a bit below par (even house wines should be tasty) and although the d\u00e9cor is lively and fun it does feel pretty chain-y and not exclusive enough to justify the prices in the next-door restaurant. Staff were tolerably helpful and there's a buzzy atmosphere. Camino's convenient but not highly commended by me.",

Ok, the food is very good, and not too pricey for the quality, there is also a good choice of Spanish wines that won't break the bank and I can have absolutey no complaints over the service. The d\u00e9cor is well done, a little rustic, a little Spanish and not too cheesy. This is certainly a good place to go for a nice meal. What it definitely isn't is a place to go for a few (cheap) beers. They don't serve pints; it's either a jug or a glass of beer (in a nice frosted glass). The glass (which must be about a half pint) is the price of a pint in most places, so the equivalent of a pint will cost well over \u00a35. Some people might be fine with this, but not me.",

Despite the poor customer service, the food is of excellent quality. The menu itself is of classy graphic design, a line representing a journey through spain. I had a cravat of very light, fruity white wine, squid-ink rice, and something intensely chocolatey, melted, molten, fudgey, for dessert. Delicious. Almost justifies the pricey-ness.",

King's Cross has been an absolute dive fo years with only a few things to keep you there of an evening if really pushed. But what with all the 'regeneration' and the truck loads of cash that have been poured into the area, there are a few things emerging from the rubble. There's King's Place, a new cultural centre and of course the requisite Starbucks amongst other things. But hidden away from the straying eyes of the general mish mash of people is Caminos. And Cominos is brilliant!! I'm hoping the ever so slightly naff crowd was due to the Festive season... but even so, we had a great time and stayed til we were asked to leave. Within moments you forget you're in King's Cross, forget you are in London and instead fall into the heart warming sense that you are in the middle of Barcelona. The tapas is great.... plentiful and moreish. The spanish beer is on tap, the house wine is super dry and super tasty and the staff are all Spanish. And not too mean on the eye neither. Oh... and the very very best bit is the table football!!! uh huh, you heard me right. Get your behinds down there.",

Like I said, the restaurant ambience is unremarkable, except for the huge domed ceiling... it was totally a gastro-pub in earlier days. Huge menu with loads of authentic sounding tapas dishes, fish and meats. We ordered a variety of tapas to share, meh.. they were okay, nothing blew me away. I felt the vegetarian platter could have been more adventurous and the meat platter seemed low on actual meat and used chillis as a big filler portion. Carnivores will not get their kicks off ordering this, believe me, I could have eaten it and I'm a vegetarian. The dessert was good, almond tart with warmed cream. Their sangria is gooood.

A strong taste of smoked paprika adds to the subtlety of the ingredients. Loved it.If the food wasn't so nice, I'd hate this place.

The result is still the Kings Cross we know and loathe, with places like Camino tacked on or hidden away inside it. At face value, Camino doesn't seem so bad. It's large, clean, sports exposed brickwork and plenty of faux-Spanish paraphernalia. What it lacks, sadly, is personality or accomplishment. I tend to avoid Spanish wine, so asking the staff for a little advice off the exclusively Iberian wine list seemed in order. No one knew what I was talking about or how to help. In the end, we had a beer. I didn't try the food, so I can't really comment. Perhaps it's wonderful. Perhaps it's not. There's nothing really wrong with Camino. It just lacks character, charm or competence, but there's nothing unusual about that in London - or indeed any other big city. It's just sort of there, possibly the only clean aspirer to bar status in the area, which will make it plenty of people's choice by default. That's ok. If you're in the area, I suppose it's probably as good as you're going to get.",

Despite the throngs of people and the resulting crowd noise (a little bit excessive, perhaps, but the food was worth it), our service was excellent: attentive, friendly, and best of all, blazingly fast. Everything we ordered was excellent and rivaled the quality that I've had in Spain. Out of everything we ordered, most notable were the Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp that arrives bubbly and simmering in wine, garlic, and other spices), and the Presa Iberica, which is roast pork served medium rare. I'll admit, eating undercooked pork made me nervous, having grown up with stories about trichinosis and whatnot, but OMG. You have to try this. It'll blow your mind. \u00a0Also, I love the wine list. The Rioja I ended up choosing was the among the best I've ever had. If I were in London longer, I'd be eating here once a week.",

It's easily the best bar in the King's Cross area (not hard I know) and its location in the Regent Quarter development will take you far away from the grimy streets of the Cross. The food is above par too - you can either order tapas at the bar or dine in the restaurant where they serve an excellent value set lunch (\u00a315 for 3 courses). But what I really like about this place is its cracking selection of affordable Spanish wine (especially the red). Oh and they have 'proper' table footy where you can re-enact Barcelona v Real Madrid.",

It's popular and the yard it is sequestered in is certainly a nice location, lots of space outside for smokers or for claustrophobics but it's just not my cup of tea. The choice of beers is very limited and the one's that are there are not so good. Resorted to buying cider in a bottle but that led to an unexpected visit to the cashpoint later in the evening, so expensive was that round! I didn't try the food so I cannot comment on that I guess I can see why some people could like this bar and at least its not part of a soulless chain, but I'd be very surprised to find myself",

So it is easy to end up thinking that there is no nice \u00a0place to go out in that area, which by the way, would be quite true.After work the place is packed with men in suits but don't let this fool you as it still manages to remain its Latin influenced relaxed atmosphere. So works especially during the summers when \u00a0you can hang around outside. I think the place is best \u00a0to go just for a drink, or maybe for a laid back meal.

It was tucked into a new build so it's not that noticeable on the high street.On arrival on a Sat night, it was very quiet & empty. But I trust my friend that she wouldn't choose a dead restaurant. As the night went on, it got a bit busier. Pretty happy that we weren't the only diners. However the bar seems to be more busy than the restaurant.Our waiter was very attentive, or maybe a bit too much. Although I can't complain much as he was very friendly and tried to make some jokes. I've had Spanish food at various restaurants and this restaurant seems to be ok. As there were a number of us, we had to go for the set menu. A reasonable price for a good variety of choices. Some dishes are better than others but one thing we all agreed on was the dessert. It was a mixture of a variety of cakes/ice cream etc and some melted and none of them taste good. I had a look at their menu recently and I don't think they are serving the same deserts as what we had. I would recommend people to go to Camino but you don't need to sweat yourself to rush to have a meal there. There are other plenty of great Spanish restaurant!",

The food is, if you're after bar snacks and light meals, realty really good. We sampled the mixed platter with some extra chorizo.

What is not to love? The barstaff, that is what! Was absolutely flabbergasted the last time I went here. The barmaid didn't even give me a chance to open my mouth before she was rolling her eyes and shrugging her shoulders at me. It was like I was he ex husband of 20 years who'd come to ask her to clean his shoes after cheating on her, taking all their money and having ten kids with a Russian supermodel. Seriously! She didn't even give me a chance to do anything wrong! She treated all my friends the same, and so we thought maybe she didn't like other women? But then she treated male customers the same! I later saw her laughing and chatting with a workmate, so I can only assume she HATES CUSTOMERS! I hope the management sort this problem out, the staff seem kind of tired and unhappy and like they hate life, which the customers do their best to ignore. Still, the food IS good, and the breakfast is cheap and amazing!",

    "text": "Can't seem to spend a weekend in London without coming here at some point.Happened upon Camino when I came down for an Arsenal match. Glad I did as I'm sure, for the fly-by visitor, this might be a venue easily missed, located quite deep off Caledonian Road, down in Varnishers Yard (which, in itself, is a fantastic little find, with the likes of Bar Pepito across the way.). But given it's proximity to Kings Cross station, no tourist should pass up either a bite to eat or a few social drinks here.My first couple of visits have primarily consisted of the latter. The vibe in Camino is very after-office-crowd-meets-bohemian-student; laid back tunes from the DJ coupled with the stylish warehouse-brick interior, laden with funky memorabilia offer a relaxing, social atmosphere. And for those who are not native to London, this is an excellent venue to quash those inevitable \"inhospitable\" labels.On my last visit to Camino I sampled a quick lunch of Carrillera: pan-fried beef cheek with Malaga Virgen wine sauce and baby onions. With a little help from some salt, this dish was just what I needed after a long morning of flights and trains. And at \u00a35.95, also good value. The restaurant is Spanish so the menu is full of similar dishes, many of which I'd never heard of but look forward to sampling on future visits.Staff are almost a little too cool for school. I say almost because, although they exude the moody Spanish look necessary for the role, they are more attentive to staff than a certain number of pretentious Edinburgh cocktail bars who employ mixologists that think they're B-list celebs and don't have to pay you, the paying customer, very much attention...!For me this is the jewel in the Varnisher's Yard crown that makes Kings Cross an excellent pre-lash destination.",

Not sure why I'm giving it three stars (I'm a tough marker), but i think I was expecting a lot less given it's location. I mean, can you blame me?We were 5 adults and a 3 mo old. There were two other occupied tables and the place was eerily quiet for being next to Kings Cross. My friend who was visiting from New York said that \"churros\" taste like french fries. OK, so he had never had churros, but why would say that? I'm going to count that as a negative from a patron. \u00a0The food was all good, but no points for creativity on the mixed and vegetarian platters (maybe I need to go back and try some of the real food, since we couldn't order many because there were two vegetarians on the table). Service was OK. It's London, and on top of that, Kings Cross. Don't expect a red carpet.Overall, good pick if you HAVE to dine at Kings Cross.",

Also, the service was friendly and relatively quick. For our meal, we ordered chorizo, fried eggs over potato and a large bruschette with roasted red peppers and eggplant. The chorizo was surprisingly tasty and authentic, especially since I had just returned from Spain. The two other dishes were cooked along the same vein, with bright and fresh flavors.

Regents Quarter means nothing to me and Varnishers Yard is not much of a help either. Why not admit it's on the corner of Caledonian and Pentonville? Having eventually found the place, the meal itself was lovely; the restaurant area is nice an airy with different sized sky lights. Not many tables were taking with most people congregating in the bar area on a Friday afternoon.The menu had a genuine Spanish feel to it and next time I will definitely try some of the tapas. Our chicken and scallop main courses were beautifully presented and tasty.Unfortunately, it all ended with a bit of a disappointment again as we were completely ignored by staff when it was time to pay up and leave. By that point only one other table was still occupied and staff milled about pointlessly. A bit more attention would have been welcome.",

The atmosphere was so dull. Walking in we were greeted by an indifferent woman who was seating people for meals, and when we asked about the Baile Funk night she had no idea what we were talking about - she eventually pointed us vaguely to the bar area past the restaurant. No problem I thought now it's about to get interesting... I was really looking forward to this! oh dear.... It was like walking into any bland old pub in the banking district, not a hint of the latin heat that the flyer implied/promised. Very disappointing. The dance floor area (not a designated area) was sort of near the DJ and if you were thinking about having a boogie you were constantly bumped into by the very harrassed looking staff who had to walk across the dance floor area to get the glasses back to the bar. They just have not thought this through, the layout the feel - and considering this is run by the same guys who run the VERY excellent Big Chill House just a few yards up the road I was mighty disappointed and thought it was a huge let down. Can't say i'll be back again though I loved the music (the 1 star is for the DJ!) - what's the point of good music when you can't enjoy it and have a good old baile/ dance without looking around wondering if you hadn't been better off listening to your iPod in your front room with your mates!!",

    "text": "I had lunch here today with a client. First the location: it's sort of inside a courtyard in a complex of renovated warehouses. It's quite hard to find from the outside but it's only a few minutes from Kings Cross station and it's quite a trendy media-ish sort of area near there. Wolff Olins is just up the road, for example. The place is in two barely-connected parts. One is a bar and it is obviously pretty lively in the evening. There's a DJ booth and a big, long bar. The other area is more restaurant-y and, at lunchtime anyway, quiet. There's a pleasant outdoor courtyard in the summer.The food was good. We had a set menu that wasn't tapas but Spanish food. In my case, a lovely vegetable soup and a potato/artichoke salad thing then an almond tart and coffee. The whole thing, including water, two coffees and two set three-course meals was around \u00a345 which isn't bad. The service was quick but the place was fairly quiet. I've been here before and found the tapas a bit hit and miss. Sometimes very tasty and generous. Othertimes, tepid and meanly portioned. The coffees were particularly good.",

Because of this I a.) have very select friends I eat with and b.)love sharing food places like Tapas joints. What's yours in mine and what's mine is my own if you didn't know already!Now Camino is a little bit of a glorified La Tasca but the food is less greasy, the service friendlier, if a little too friendly and their sangria strong. All winning points I'll add! So yes the waitress was slow and they did sit our large group on 2 tables because apparently if you have more than 8 at a table you MUST have their set menu which will cost your granny. Actually, at this point in the review I removed a star from 4 to 5. My granny is worth a star!So yes, come here eat, share food, get the prawns they are lovely, as is the squid ink risotto, and you are sure to have a lovely evening out.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time yesterday after reading a review of the place in a February edition of London Lite recommending the breakfast and coffee. Set back away from the hustle and bustle of King's Cross, this place is enormous and perfect for after work drinks. The venue itself is divided into a restaurant and several more casual areas with tables, stools, bars and sofas, as well as free wifi. House red decent, as was the draught Cruzcampo beer, served in frozen glasses. Not bad for February (when it was snowing), even better in July where they appear to have the use of a decent-sized open air area. Also of interest was the 'Cafe Bonbom, an expresso coffee with very sweet and syrupy cream - I like sweet things, so this was perfect for me, although perhaps not to everyone's taste. Before leaving, I also sampled some of the tapas: the acorn fed, Iberian ham was excellent (and described in the menu as the world's best), the spinach croquettes were very good and an onion-style bruchetta was delicious, but probably not a good idea before a first date! Before I left at about 6pm, the place had really livened up and was heaving with after work types. I can see why as it had a really nice atmosphere and ticked lots of boxes: food, tick. Drinks, tick. Atmosphere, tick. According to several sources, the breakfasts (which go on until 4pm at the weekend) are an absolute must, so that'll be next on my list. Come here and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The bar was open when we passed this place on a bank holiday monday however we decided to come back another day when the restaurant was open. Good decision.Camino is a cool spanish tapas style food which makes a great stop for something light but filling. A great place to eat with some friends in a relaxed laid back but still classy environment.The cheese/figs wrapped in parma ham is a must-try. Everything else was good, well cooked but for asian tastebuds can be a little bland. This is fine for those watching their blood pressure I guess, but be ready to add salt particularly to the tuber/marrow family of foods. The quality of everything was cooked fantastically. Potatoes were saut\u00e9ed to perfection. The squid sauce was lacking but no complaints about the creaminess of the squid (yep a feature I would never have associated with that piece of seafood). Ordering a few dishes and sharing is the winningest way to eat here.Price was, for the quantities and simplicity of what you're getting a little pricey. Expect \u00a320-30 per head. However in the context of the great environment, superb service and general satisfaction of each dish, this place is a great introduction to Spanish style tapas and there are plenty more interesting things I'd like to try on the menu.Make sure to pick up the membership card at the end of your meal. Points will rack up pretty slowly, but registering it online will give you instantly 500 points or \u00a35 off your next meal here.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Camino since a weekend trip in 2009, when I was working for 10 weeks in Altrincham. I took the Virgin Train down from Manchester, and stayed at a hotel near King's Cross. A quick search for tapas places within walking distance came back with Camino, and now I try to include it into every trip to London or Slough I make.Even though I've never had an issue walking up and getting a table at Camino, I decided to use their online booking. What with all that's going on in London this summer, I figured it was the safe bet. The place was busy, but there were a few seats at the bar, so I would've been OK as a single. The number of tables each server worked was a bit high, but the attitude of staff was good even if response time was a bit slow.Wine flights! While perusing the menu, I really had no idea what I wanted to eat, so I went back to the wines first. When I saw the wine flight listings, I thought that would be a good change of pace from getting just a bottle of something cheap (since I don't usually buy a good wine all for myself). I decided to start with the dry sherry flight. Clockwise from front, Amontillado, Manzanilla, and Fino.I paired the sherry flight with the \"Tabla de Quesos,\" which was three lovely cheeses and various sweets, nuts, and crackers. I started with the Amontillado first, going to the Fino, then the Manzanilla last, comparing the wines with the cheeses. More research is required here; all the combinations were enjoyable. Because of the big shift between a sherry flight and a red wine flight, I decided to have a glass of Camino's sangria while waiting for the second set of tapas to come out. So, this meal became more of a starter-and-main sort of affair than just a bunch of small platesFor the \"main\" -- Conchinillo con Morcilla - Roasted suckling pig from Aragon with Burgos morcilla, apple puree and thyme. Morcilla is Spanish blood sausage...boudin to you New Orleanians, \"black pudding\" to you lot in the UK. The morcilla is underneath a generous slice of roast pork, which had a great skin and a lovely sauce. The applesauce was such a great addition, as well. Add some great brown bread to these two, and it was a real winner. I added Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce as a veggie, and were they ever wonderful!To accompany the pork and asparagus--Red Wine Flight! Three Tempranillos, from Castilla y Leon, Rioja and Ribera. Lovely wines, all.Dessert: Postel de Chocolate, a flourless individual cake with a \"molten\" chocolate pudding filling, ginger ice cream, and a bit of raspberry sauce. The wine is a all de Xal&oacute; Mistela, a Spanish fortified wine.Service: this trip, a bit slow. Not sure if that's because of the crowd that evening or if there was a problem in the kitchen, but things didn't come out as fast as they have in the past. Gave me time to let all this food settle, but still, problematic.Overall, however, this meal was a winner, continuing my appreciation for Camino.",

Didn't look at the wine list, but the \u00a330 Garnacha could've been quite a bit better for the price point. Sat at the bar to eat. Prob one of best places (for a duo!) in restaurant, apart from if you manage to snag a table by the windows facing the inner courtyard. Great thing about being at the bar is the ultra-quick service, being able to see through to the other side, and being able to have an a lot more private conversation.So what's good about this place? The bar set-up was comfortable (nothing like 10 Greek Street's butt-sleep-inducing, elbow-your-neighbours bar area) and the service pretty good. Not sure I'll be running back. The food is not a pull at all. This is more like a back-up option place, if you are hungry and your options are few. Turns out the jury's back in!",

Sounds simple, but isn't.I ordered the meat medium well, the you can skip the sauce, because the meat overwhelmes (did i just make up this word?)everything!It s grilled on (of course) a special Spanish grill. And it's well worth the investment. The atmosphere was great, the bartender and the waiters were very nice (like in Spain). So an overall 5* experience.

Very nice and attentive without you realising they were there. Even tap water was topped up regularly! Look/atmosphere: Restaurant exterior is tucked away neatly and very quiet clean alley, you don't realise you are in the centre of kings cross. Interior is pleasing to the eye, clean, modern wood design and tables spaced apart nicely. Music is different on each night - sometimes live or dj but might be a little loud for some (I didnt mind though) Table for 2 is smallish if you wanted lots of tapas buts not hard to eat quicker as food tasted great!Price: Great quality food and totally value for money, about \u00a320 per head. If you become a regular there is a loyalty card scheme and you can get points and free bits now and again. Overall: 5/5 - I had a great experience there.

I went there on a first date and it was perfect- just loud enough so you'd have to sit close, but just busy enough to be distracted if your partner isn't entertaining.In terms of food, it was just okay. Nothing wowed me. As for drinks- really interesting menu, and very tasty (hence the 4 stars)!I would totally go back and recommend it to others.",

    "text": "Definitely on my list of my favorite places in London! Went here with my family for dinner as we're big fans of traditional Spanish tapas. It seemed pretty busy when we went, but it was easy to grab a table for four without a reservation. We got a pretty nice spread: tomato bread (simple, but tasty!), embutidos, jamon, arroz negro (probably one of my favorite things to eat there), the rib eye, and the Iberico meatballs. Everything was very tasty - I don't have a bad thing to say about anything we had.This place is great for groups and overall a very friendly atmosphere. Our server had quite the load as they seemed a little short-staffed when we went, but he was very attentive to our needs and made some excellent recommendations. Will definitely be back!",

Say they close at midnight but decided to close early at 10. Let us order food 10 mins till 10...never mentioned they were closing early. Still brought our food in a rush, potato's bravas a bit undercooked because of the hurry. Went to go get another drink said the bar was closed and never did last call. Said they rang the bell for last call- not one of us out of 3 of us ever heard a bell. Normally when you ring a bell you yell 'last call.' Yet 2 minutes later they let 2 people order beer and said that the one guy worked there. Very rude and disrespectful after they made a huge deal to not serve us. If you're going to serve your employees free beer once you \"shut it down\" how bout you wait until your customers leave the establishment...and side note...please don't rush us out of there and spray cleaning agent on the tables next to us as we are still eating dinner.

It was not too crowded for a Friday - we probably didn't need our reservation.I was pleasantly surprised by all the vegetarian options. Loved the cheese platter, but it's quite small. We definitely needed 2 for a group of 6. The arzua ulloa was really good, although not what I expected - I was imagining stringy cheese like in a mozzarella stick, but it's an airy, crisp experience. At the waitress' suggestion, we got the spinach salad - I think you can skip it.Overall I enjoyed it, but the price was a little high for many return visits.",

Its made with watermelon marinated in sangria and served with slices of safran cured cod. An absolute delight and a must order if available. I was impressed and would comeback!!!",

    "text": "I've worked in this area for years but never made it to Camino, but today I was walking by and noticed the Express Lunch - 2 tapas for \u00a36.95 so decided to give it a go.It's tucked away in a quiet little courtyard but there's a sign on the main road to help you find your way. Inside, the restaurant is really big - and today at 1pm, pretty empty and also really quite warm (much warmer than outside).The express menu has 8-10 things on it. I went for the ham & cheese croquetas and the huevos rotos (I wanted patatas bravas but they weren't on the express menu - odd, as I'd think it'd cost them less and be quicker than frying eggs!) Complimentary olives are brought - nice but not great.Even though I only had the 2 things, they came out at different times, with the croquettas appearing first. You get 4 and they're the size of a ping pong ball. I enjoyed them \u00a0- I found them \u00a0pretty much the same as the ones from Brindisa. Then the huevos rotos came out. Having learned how to make this dish from Omar Allibhoy directly in a private lesson (I'm not above name-dropping), I knew what to expect - broken eggs (hence the same) mixed with sauteed potatoes with maybe some onions and peppers (I didn't want to spend the extra \u00a32 for chorizo). Oddly though it was 2 fried eggs on top of some fried potato rounds - a huge portion, but odd. The potatoes were nice but the eggs were overcooked, and didn't ooze at all (the waiter offered to 'cut the huevos' for me. As I've been using cutlery for over 30 years, I declined and managed it all on my own). The bill was actually nearly \u00a312, because of the Coke and the service charge. Too much for lunch that's 2 tapas plates, to be honest. They use the Zapper app and if you've never used it, download it and when the bill comes, open it and scan the QR code. You can pay via your phone and get \u00a35 off your first time.",

    "text": "A small chain serving Spanish tapas for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's quite a reliable chain, no fancy affair but just expect to find the classic dishes and usually done quite well. I do enjoy the restaurant hidden in a quiet courtyard away from the hustle and bustle of King's Cross. Yet is makes it very convenient to get to. The restaurant is very spacious, made to look modern and clean. The large windows also allows a lot of natural light in. It was a really comfortable place to settle in to. Bacon rollStarting with a lovely bacon roll with coffee for just \u00a34.00. A lovely soft white toasted bun filled with crispy bacon, rocket, tomatoes and added cheese. The flavours were all very balanced with the rocket adding a nice earthiness to the cured bacon and tomato providing moisture. Highly recommend adding the lovely stretchy cheese to add depth, also to keep in the heat and binding all the ingredients together.Tortilla de patata This was a lot better than it looks. The potato slices were beautifully soft and tender, rich in yolk making it nice and creamy in between and seasoned beautifully. Full Spanish breakfast Genuiely suprised at how delicious this was and all very well composed. The morcilla was lovely, fluffy and bringing in a lot of flavours. Chorizo was one of the softest ones I've had and a very welcomed new texture to enjoy pairing well with the other soft textures in the dish. The flavours were nice bringing in sweet and spicy notes. Bacon was crispy and greaseless. Roasted piquilla peppers were cut thin, melting soft and really juicy and sweet. Refreshing! Potatoes were reasonable in taste, crispy and fluffy inside and a fried egg and bread is always welcomed on any dish for me.Omelette of Serrano ham and arz\u00faa cheese This was nice and simple. Cooked firm yet still remaining its moisture and bounce. Lovely chunks of ham to give flavour and enough cheese for that creamy comforting feel. Served with toasted breadChurros + chocolate Pretty good if you ask me. It was nice and crispy yet doughy as you chew on it. They were very satisfying just on its own, sprinkled with powered sugar and of course if you like a little more indulgence than you can always dip it in the rich thick milky chocolate dip. Delicious.For a chain that expanded a lot since the last few years I am very impressed at how the quality of food is still consistently good. Pricing is also very reasonable and affordable, especially for breakfast. Much more variety than the usual cafes and breakfast places in King's Cross which makes it refreshing and exciting. Staff were friendly and smiley which contributed a lot to the relaxing airy atmosphere. We could have stayed here all day but sadly we had other plans.",

We all had the lunch tapas formula. It was cheap and portions were satisfying. And most importantly, it tasted very good. I don't know about the prices of the other dishes, but we were on the run and this formula was convenient both for price and efficiency. We were almost the only ones in the restaurant because we showed up at the end of the service. We were served fast as required and with pleasantness. The place looks nice, and I could spot their bar, in the next room. It is situated in a little cul-de-sac where you'll find other bars. I was told that at night it's like a big party, all the customers from Camino's bar and the other 2 mingling in the hidden patio.",

    "text": "I've been going to Camino for a number of years now and it's good both as a restaurant and as a bar. Most recently we were here for a drink and shared a bottle of wine, a very drinkable red at a good price, the place was busy but we managed to get a couch and catch up. The place is well designed so that the restaurant and bar remain separate from one another so that it doesn't become a conflict between those dining and those drinking. The bar extends quite far into the building so finding space isn't normally an issue, the outdoor area and the table football add the area. On the restaurant side, although maybe a little pricy, the tapas and larger courses are brilliant, share a platter as you won't be disappointed!",

The hostess was intent on having me sit by the \u00a0server station or in a corner where I could not use my left arm. The restaurant was only 1/3 full at 10 pm but she wouldn't budge. If service and comfort is important id skip this place unless you come in nice even numbers. Look across the street on the corner there's a few gems there.",

You can book a table, but if you get there for 7:30ish, it's likely you'll get a table.Why does this place make me happy? It's a mixture of great music with occasional Latin tunes and old-school classics, a cool outdoor courtyard which is just as packed as inside and the party is going on both inside and out! What's also nice about this place is that it never feels too crowded and there's a cool mix of people here too. The tapas are good, but a tad overpriced for the portions you get. The final thing that makes me merry? Their sangria is DAMN GOOD ;)",

    "text": "Nice food. Friendly service. Odd table location choice.I met a friend here for lunch and had to follow my nose a bit - it is a little hidden away in a courtyard. My friend was already at the table, and out of a sea of many many empty tables, the host had placed us in between the only two occupied tables in the place. I found this a little odd, but didn't (unusually) make a fuss! I was facing the kitchen and it was quite interesting to see all the preparation and goings on there anyway. Plus the couple to the right of us were clearly having a very quiet row and that was quite entertaining! We ordered a few things to share, thinking that we would see how we went and then order some more. We actually didn't end up ordering any more as the plates are fairly generous portions and, well it was only lunchtime! We ordered a mixed cheese plate, ham croquettes, chorizo, a special salad with cheese and pears and patatas bravas. Everything was delicious - but the salad blew me away. I rather hogged that plate and bargained the chorizo and potatoes for it! It never really got very busy - so I'm not sure what the policy of cramming everyone into one corner was about, perhaps the waiter preferred not to walk so far...? It was a good overall experience though. I understand that Camino also has restaurants in Blackfriars and Monument, which I shall certainly be trying at some point soon.",
