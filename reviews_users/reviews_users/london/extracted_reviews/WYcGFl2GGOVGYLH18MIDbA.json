They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own (thus cutting costs further!) We got the mezze sample plate to start, which was a little of everything, all very good. I particularly loved the dill yogurt dip. And they were very generous with bread. Then we ordered a bunch of kabobs (not doner, I'm a little skittish about doner) and I can't remember the names of anything but the standouts for me were the chicken and the spicy lamb mince. I LOVE lamb mince. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.Update: My dad, after six weeks in England and France, believes his meals here were the best of the whole trip.",

Turkish BBQ at it's very best - If you fancy a posh kebab cooked in front of you at a reasonable price then check this place out. It gets very busy so might be worth calling in advance for a table. One point to make is that they really lay on the salt when cooking the kebabs so make sure you ask for no salt....It's really does make a difference. One other great thing is that you can bring you own booze as they have no yet got an alcohol license - a cheap night all round!",

The lamb shish was golden and flavorful, ungreasy, non-chewy. Drizzled with the yogurt and spicy sauces at the table, I was scooping every last bit off the plate by the end.Only complaint is the curse of all good places. It's obviously popular for the above-par quality of food, which means the service is spotty during the manic dinner hour. Waitresses are squeezing around the tiny space with baskets of warm bread, dips, and heaping piles of meat coming off the grill like a factory. If you're not in a rush, the randomness of the service won't bother you: it's BYOB, so it's really not hard to be patient: you'll want a little downtime to get through that bottle (or two) of cheap wine from the convenience store up the street!",

We were touring from California and didn't know the area very well and from the review on yelp, the restaurant looked like a shady hole in the wall. Upon arrival, however, we came to find a gigantic crowd around the small entrance. We pushed through and they got to us right away, seating us within twenty minutes because of all of the people. The wall decor had chillies hanging in the window and you could see and smell that magical grill where the most aromatic lamb was sizzling. Though it took a while for the order to come in, the eggplant salad was cooked perfectly and seasoned even better, and it melted in your mouth. Everything was soooo fresh and wonderful. Honestly, it almost made me be a vegetarian how incredible the Greek and Aubergine salads tasted. That is, until the meat came. OMG the combo kebab made me want to have a bottomless stomach so I could keep eating forever!! The meat was so juicy and tender and bursting with flavor. Every bite was a bite of heaven! This place is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, and I HIGHLY recommend it to both tourists and locals, vegetarians and meat-lovers, and anyone else who appreciates good food!",

    "text": "'Fez Mangal' is a fairly recent but VERY popular Turkish BBQ restaurant in Ladbroke Grove.I opted for a mixed doner which is only available in large for \u00a35.50. A medium of either chicken or lamb will set you back only \u00a34.The lamb was obviously good quality. Juicy, tender and not too fatty. It was a tad mild to my liking but some may prefer the subtler spicing. The chicken was also top notch. The wrap was paper thin and a little too stiff.The salad consisted of red cabbage, onions & diced cucumber. It was nice but loses marks for lack of variety.The garlic sauce was a good one.The chilli sauce was OK but despite asking for \"lots\" there was not enough of it.The service was fast, even though the place was very busy on this Wednesday evening in September.Most of the other take-away customers were opting for the skewered kebabs.This fine establishment lacks some of the greatness that make 'Best Mangal' my all time favourite ocakbasi and is also a little behind 'Ottoman' & 'Woody Grill' in my personal opinion.However, don't get me wrong, 'Fez Mangal' is the best thing to happen to Ladbroke Grove in a long time.The locals are understandably flocking to this place and unlike North End Road or Stoke Newington there is only ONE Turkish Grill in the area.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

    "text": "Welcome to Turkey!......Or so one might think once they step into this authentic Turkish restaurant. After returning from Istanbul earlier this year, I desperately sought out a place to feed my need for authentic kebabs filled with all natural products, enticing meza platers, and yummy yogurt drinks. I was delighted to find that Fez Mangal satisfies all of these needs.Upon entering into this food haven, one might think that its 'hole in the wall' persona lessens its authenticity and quality. You would be sorely wrong my dear friends. For those of you who have visited Istanbul, you'll know that a manic atmosphere, more times than not, makes for a fantastic gastronomical experience. Fez Mangal follows through on all accounts. With limited seating and even fewer places to stand for takeaway, you'll be hard to find this place not packed to the rim (no matter what day of the week). While this can often spur unfriendly staff, the employees here are friendly none the less. The food, as mentioned earlier, is as authentic as one can get without standing in the middle of the Grand Baazaar. Fresh BBQ, made right in front of you, with fresh ingredients, makes for a definite healthy option to feed any late night kebab craving. I highly suggest the Lamb Shish as this is my personal favourite and sharing (if there are two of you) the meza plate for two as a starter. The portions are quite large (most of the time I leave unable to finish my meal), but are certainly worth it (the prices are exceptionally low for the amount of food offered in one meal).",

We shared a mixed grill which was served on rice and with a generous serving of salad on the side, as well as delicious garlic and chillie sauces. For a sporadic meat eater like me, this was perfect, lots of different flavours, perfectly cooked. All the meat is piled up behind a glass counter as you walk in. Carnivore heaven - veggie hell! The don't have a licence but invite BYO which would make this a very affordable dinner option. The fresh mint tea (fresh leaves sharing the water with a tea bag - free top ups!) was perfect for daytime.",

There's only one toilet so there was constantly people waiting in line and trying to get around the table, a little annoying.Besides that issue the food and service is good!",

I absolutely loved the tender and juicy lamb blocks. I also did try the baklavas, and it was wonderfully fresh and tasty. The baklavas arrived even warm still. I highly recommend this place around London. Have to come visit. I for sure will be returning a second time if not more!",

I picked every tender piece of white flesh off and wished I had more. It was perfectly grilled on the outside and soft and moist inside. Just a tiny splash of lemon and bam...all sorts of deliciousness!Kebabs as expected..also delicious.When you walk in you see the grill fired up and kebabs ready to be devoured. Very cool place.",
