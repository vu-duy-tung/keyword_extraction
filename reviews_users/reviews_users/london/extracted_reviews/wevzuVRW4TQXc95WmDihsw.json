Like most London delis the prices are not cheap however and I got a little stung when settling down for some brunch. For me del Aziz is a great little place to visit as a treat but is too pricey for a regular pit-stop. The cafe area gets very busy which is teastament to the popularity of the place but the staff will try to squeeze you onto a bench with other people which meakes it not the most private of places to have a catch up. Go next door for the restaurant where there is a full menu and much more seating if you are prepared to pay more again.",

    "text": "Upon entering Del'aziz in Fulham Broadway, one is hit with a visual sensory overload of delectable cakes and delights. The walls of this mediterranean delicatessen & brasserie are lined with an assortment of olive oils, chocolates, hand painted ceramics and mint tea glasses just to name a few and once you've found yourself a seat amongst the communal tables you'll be finding yourself uncontrollably getting another glance at the cake display in the window before checking out the menu. Right, must not look, we came in for brunch. The menu included typical brunch fare with mediterranean twist. The serving sizes were rather generous and while the poached eggs were cooked to perfection, I was little disappointed with the lack of flavour of the white beans which I was expecting to have a little spice or oompf. I would definitely visit again as I distinctly remember the Berber Pancakes (Moroccan Spongy Semolina Pancake) calling my name.",

But, the best thing is their breads! Wow, the best fresh, crusty, yet light and airy and rustic, loaves of bread are baked here daily. \u00a0They do several different types. And all of their dishes whether it be sandwiches (the best looking I've ever seen, by the way) or meze, salad or soup they serve on or with one of their specially baked bundles of goodness. They also do an array of very fresh salads, but that's not all they do; they have a generous menu with a wide variety of choices to choose from. Their cakes (beautiful) are also baked right there. They serve mint tea in charming Turkish pots and have decorated the place quite sweetly. Tables are inside and out - perfect place for a leisurely lunch, especially during great weather! this place is yummy!",

You can choose from your typical brunch dishes (eggs, pancakes, English fry-up) or lunchy main courses. The portions are enormous, so it's a good value for money if you need to fill up.It's loosely Mediterranean, and there are some pretty tasty-looking Moroccan-style pancakes. I had a fry-up of cheese with sausage, potatoes, and veggies and a Moroccaned-up lamb roast. Their use of Moroccan-influenced spices and herbs made the lamb a memorable dish. It's solid but didn't knock any socks off. Perhaps there's a way to order better?It's also a shop, where you can stock up on middle eastern essentials like lokum (Turkish delight) and halva.Gluten-free notes: You can look at all of the cakes, but you can't touch. Nothing is gluten-free. Sorry. Don't cry, you've got Ottolenghi, which is probably better anyway. Many of the dishes on the menu are gluten-y and beware -- your food may show up with an unexpected slice of bread plopped on the top even if the waitress says it doesn't come with toast.",

I didn't even mind when I dropped a blob of the hollandaise on my white top. I had been planning to finish breakfast with one of the tasty cakes in the window. They really are the best looking, and probably hugest, cakes and pastries that I have EVER seen. Alas, I was defeated but shall return another day to see what I missed. The only minor blip was the waitress who didn't understand what we wanted and had to fetch a colleague to take our order. Maybe she was new? I can overlook this, just this one time.. and only because the eggs were so perfectly cooked (nothing worse than an overcooked poached egg) and the rest of everything was scrummy. And I mean everything. Lay-out, menu, cute salt and pepper bowls, music, food.. the whole shebang!We were there early at around 8.45, but when we walked past around 10 later that morning, it was busy busy busy! Seems the rest of Fulham area agrees with me that this place is a little bit brilliant!",

Del'aziz, you will always get a mixed review from me for that lamb kebab, but thank you for saving us from our dark and scary new apartment when Foxtons messed up so badly.",

Del Aziz don't go the whole 9 yards but all their amazing looking cakes and pastries do sit by the window and certainly seem to attract a good deal of attention. I have had plenty of different ones, the flapjacks most recently and honestly, they're some of the best around. They don't just do cakes though. It's also a deli and a restaurant. Mediterranean they say but it's more North African Mediterranean than Greek or Italian. They do this awesome 'frying pan' breakfast which is great after a heavy night and there are loads of great salads and sandwiches filled up right to the edges of gluttony. Loads of fresh juices and smoothies too plus the usual coffees, teas and other suitably warming drinks designed mostly for the good of the soul. Top place.",

We were both very pleasantly surprised.Del Aziz played music that was loud but calming (I think they played some Italian opera at one point) and there was tons of space inside (I love the large tables). They also have some outdoor seating on a nice little road (no cars allowed) which is very nice in summer.The food was also surprisingly good. I order the Lobster Royal which was basically a very large Eggs Benedict with extra small lobster bits and sun-dried tomatoes. Be warned... it's very rich and I didn't manage to eat it all. I think this is partly because I stopped eating for a bit after being told off for eating too quickly! So yummy.My girlfriend ordered a fruit salad with toast and greek yogurt and also seemed to enjoy it. The yogurt comes very thick and looks kind of like ice-cream, but it's very good. I do recommend it.They could definitely get a 5 stars from me one day if they sharpened up the services. It seemed that they had plenty of staff but we didn't received much attention. Additionally, patrons kept on leaving the door slightly ajar as they left which let cold air blow in my direction. I got up a few times to close it and the staff noticed and apologized. Obviously it wasn't their fault but it would have been nice if they started ensuring the door was properly closed after realizing it was bothering me. There were other small issues too such as having to ask a few times for a saucer to put our tea bags on (we didn't want to stain their tables).That being said, the staff were friendly and we did see them chat with their patrons.Del Aziz had some signs up about deals and events so we'll probably be back for them. I think they had a 3 course meal (including a glass or wine or beer) on Sundays for 10 GBP and belly dancing (interesting) on Fridays and Saturdays.They also have a large selection of cakes that looked really good!",

I got the sea bass which came at the recommendation of the server but I was a little disappointed at it was difficult to eat and came on a small chopping board which meant that some of the food spilled over onto the table. One of my friends tried to order wine but was told they didn't have that particular kind and was recommended some paint stripper instead. No one was really impressed with what they had.They also had a belly dancer going around the tables which seemed a little out of place and made me feel like putting a \u00a31 in a pint pot. I don't think that I would come back again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lazy Sunday brunch and left full and happy! It wasn't very crowded, the vibe was relaxed, and the menu looked interesting, but the pastries and cakes in the window are what caught my attention walking by in the first place. My boyfriend ordered the portobello and goat cheese burger (which was delicious), and I ordered the vegetarian breakfast. I assumed it would come out as a normal full English breakfast but I was very pleasantly surprise when my mountain of deliciousness came out. The thickest cut of brioche I've ever had topped with hummus, roasted tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, spinach, pine nuts, pesto, and poached duck egg. Are you kidding me? So good. Unfortunately I was so full I didn't get to try any cakes, but I will be back for that and some Turkish coffee. Overall I would recommend this place for an easy lunch with a few friends, but they have larger tables that could accommodate large groups! Also great spot to get some work done alone.",

    "text": "The softer end of generic North African / Levantine food, meets gastro pub standards, meets quite nice cafe, it's difficult to precisely categorise the Del Aziz chain. You could do a lot worse than order the merguez and couscous. Similarly, the cakes are good, albeit occasionally hit and miss ( red velvet cake was pronounced \"bland\" and \"fake -tasting\" on our last visit, although the apple sharlotka was superb). This particular branch has great, attentive staff- I didn't for one second begrudge the service charge added to the bill.",

I went here a month ago and I'm still fuming from how badly we were treated and how poor the quality of the food and service was. \u00a0The only thing I liked about this place was the venue. \u00a0Can someone please buy out this owner, fire all the staff and make this into the amazing venue it has the potential to be! \u00a0Saddest part is that Del'Aziz is a chain and because of my experiences here I won't be visiting or recommending any of the other venues. Extremely disappointed!!!",

Tomorrow. We took a seat at a hunk-a-wood communal table, between the imported sugars and homemade hampers. Enjoying strong coffee was just the beginning, and after browsing the delicatessen and brasserie offerings, we were soon picking away at a rich pastry crust filled with roasted feta, tomatoes and basil. But we watched as thick slices of decadent cake was served all around us, drooling over every one. Somehow our discipline prevailed, but I'm sure that won't last for long for me. Especially since they have free wi-fi and easily accessible plugs! Cakelandia, here I come!",

I have however been to the restaurant and I enjoyed it. Not a great fan of this type of food, basically because I am not a huge fan of haloumi , couscous etc. But I do like kebab and chicken and this majors on the menu. Slightly cramped inside but you soon get used to and the belly dancers generally take you mind of the people sat next to you. They certainly put on a show here and the food was good and not expensive (circa \u00a312 for a main). I had a great night here, food was good but not really my thing and the belly dancers were great !!",

We weren't exactly hunting for the restaurant in London that sounded most like Scottish oldman rock band 'Del Amitri' (although if we were this would have been a great success).So what's the big draw? Is it the massive-sized cake slices, strudels and muffins in the window that must near 1000 calories each and can weigh in at \u00a35+ a slice? Is it the communal bench seating dotted around deli purchasables? Is it the good strong coffee that is very reasonably priced?No, it's simply Eggs Benedict, Omelettes and Pancakes. Nothing exactly Moroccan or particularly special, but still some solid good if pricey brunch food served in a vibrant room. If you can bear the crowds, the wooden block stools and the ensuing Elbow Olympics then it's not a bad choice.",

Oh yes, and I always get a glass of wine - the list is pretty good.The dessert 'bar' is a bonus. \u00a0You can wander over and choose something to fulfill the sweetest of sweet tooths or opt for the selection of pastries (like baklava) for something slightly less sinful. \u00a0I'm always sucked into the shelves of gourmet foods from around the world personally.If I had a friend with a kitchen like this in real life, that friend would probably tire of my company!",
