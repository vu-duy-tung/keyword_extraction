There is a selection of smaller cornbread dishes and all day breakfasts consisting of eggs, black beans, cheese and a choice of cornbread (the eponymous arepa) / corn pancakes, and shredded beef or shredded chicken. The place is just busy enough - we've always been able to get a seat. They also serve a large selection of drinks and cocktails. A rare place worth a visit day or night",

Only downer is they only come with just the wrap, you have to order side dishes separately. If you want a traditional comida Latina, then head over and check them out. The place didn't pick up until after 8 oddly though, and the drinks were borderline expensive. Added bonus, they're right on the canal, so you get a nice view even though it was freezing out there today in particular. I'm sure summer will come soon ;)",

    "text": "I'm a repeat customer at Arepa - if not for their downright delicious arepas and cachapas, then for the fantastic views over the canal (especially when the sun's out!). I love that it's a family-owned restaurant that started out as a market stall. That home-made feeling and the passion for their food is still apparent in the restaurant today.On the weekdays, they do a terrific deal which consists of a hot drink (tea or coffee) and an arepa of your choice for \u00a36. On weekends, however, it's my brunch place of choice. The perico (Venezuelan scrambled eggs) and shredded chicken with guacamole is heaven on a plate. I'm not a huge fan of plantains so I usually ask for these to be removed and they always offer me some extra eggs or chicken to compensate. Staff are friendly, though service can be a little slow sometimes. I don't really notice because I'm too busy enjoying what's going on around me. Child friendly and a great place to grab a coffee with a friend. Make sure you arrive early on the weekend at peak brunch hours though: you won't get a seat otherwise.",

The pancake didn't have much flavour, but the cheese was lovely and there was heaps of it. However, there was nothing with it except four tiny tiny pieces of cress?! I needed something else with it, maybe something green or just about anything really! Also they didn't have any red wine left which was a shame. My friends enjoyed their meals, but didn't seem to get overly excited by them either. I would quite like to try some of the other food, but I won't be rushing back.",

    "text": "So sad. This place looks cool, sounds tasty. Nope.Fair enough it was a busy Sunday. But we got seated right away. Then it went downhill from there.We came in to have a late-ish breakfast. Three people. Ordered coffees. Took forever to come, one of which took twice as long.Ordered a starter (cassava fingers) and two plates and one a la carte taco thing. TWO other tables who had sat down AFTER us were served their food first. Coffee was long gone by now, wanted to get another one but didn't want to give them more money or possibly wait that long again.Our friends a la carte came first, she almost finished hers by the time we got our plates. Which was not as much food as I would have expected from a place that serves traditional simple food. All oddly separated, not touching. The flavors were ok. It's just crazy to me because a majority of the items on our plates are things that were probably precooked and kept warm (or were just shredded fucking cheese) and just needed to be plated while the corn tortilla things and plantains fried.The starter never showed. We had to stop the waitress a few times to ask about the food in general and even about the starter. She got them to make it at the end, which we were only ok with because we were still hungry. The dipping sauce was something creamy and garlic but it had a bad bitter aftertaste to me. blech.There were a few apologies, no real explanation, and just bad bad service. Ugh, makes me shutter just thinking about it. I just don't even want to go back and try again. I've lost hope.",

    "text": "This amazing new hang out has the vibe!The masterminds behind the famous Arepa & Co Camden market stall (who in fact unofficially first brought Venezuelan cuisine to this fair city) have finally opened up a gorgeous little cafe right on the canal. Perched above the water just west of the Haggerston bridge, this makes for the best people watching spot for all the activity on the tow path and in the water itself!If you haven't had Venezuelan food before you should definitely check it out here. They boast an all-day breakfast and brunch menu on the weekends with the likes of Venezuelan scrambled eggs, arepas or cachapas (corn bread pocket or sweet corn pancake) \u00a0filled with chicken, guacamole, black beans, shredded beef, cheese... In fact if you like cheese in general you'll love almost anything on the menu. Cheese filled pastries, cheese topped plantains...Tasty starters include yuca wedges with garlic mayo dipping sauce and little fried plantain discs toped with coleslaw and spicy mayo. Most of the dishes on the menu come from different regions within Venezuela, so there is a good range of things to try.To drink they have delicious mango, passion fruit or guava milkshakes, real Venezuelan cacao hot chocolate (very rich but made without sugar so this is for serious real chocolate lovers) and wait for it... they make incredible coffee with nude espresso beans. Coffee is so good that it would be worth coming here just as a coffee option, let alone all the other tempting culinary delights. The small array of sugary baked goods on the counter as you enter is very tantalising, especially the look of the raspberry and white chocolate chip brownie, but sadly I'll have to leave this for next time as I was too full from the rest of out meal to squeeze in any more!Everything is crafted with so much love and care here. You can tell the owners are really passionate about their food and delivering good service to their customers. Also, I'm not sure if they are waiting for a liquor license, but you can BYOB for a small corkage fee.In short, this place has it all - great food, amazing coffee, friendly staff, cool interior, perfect location... the only thing they are waiting on is their credit card paying machine, so for now it is cash only but they are installing their card machine asap.",

The fillings are delicious and very generous, I always have a huge appetite and I'm full after about an arepa and a half (my friends who like more normal portions seem to be happy with one arepa and maybe a shares starter). Recommended: Arepa pabell\u00f3n, yuca fries, patacones en canaima.Prices are fair, cocktails are pretty good, atmosphere is fun. Decor is like a South American backpacker hostel, colourful hammock chairs included. The service can be a bit patchy - it takes forever to get anyone's attention. They will ignore you, whether there's one of you or eight. To be fair, they're often very busy. Just bring some patience with you and you'll enjoy the experience.",

My husband loved the beef arepa and thought it delicious.We started with the tajadas, fried plaintain with grated cheese. Whilst I loooooooove plantains, these were just OK. I think I just like them charred a bit more so there is a greater caramel flavour. The cheese could have been more generous. Then we got the yucca fries, which are arranged very interestingly: like a Jenga set. The fries and accompanying garlic and parsley sauce are delicious.I ordered the veg arepa and was very disappointed. The roasted veg was SO bland; the goat cheese addition was the only flavour enhancer beside the arepa. I also ordered a side of the telita cheese. It was fine, nothing to rave about. I've had better cheese in Bulgaria.My friend got the caipirinha and it has so much sugar she had to dilute it lol.",

This was THE BEST meal I can remember having for a long time. Everything was so flavorful and fresh! \u00a0Very bold and complex flavors but nothing we had was too heavy or filling, perfection. I ordered the chicken and plantain arepa. It was similar to a chicken salad, as in the best chicken salad ever, tucked into a little hand made bread and stuffed with cooked plantain. My husband had the traditional meal selection, it was similar to a beef brisket with rice and beans. Both were fabulous! We finished the meal with tres leche cake and some pastries filled with a spicy chocolate. The service was more than friendly and attentive. Great selection of fresh juice, coffee drinks and craft cocktails. If I lived in London, this would most definitely be my haunt.",

    "text": "Really liked this place, which, as far as I can tell, is one of very few places in London which does arepas, which are a Venezuelan dish and are delicious(/delicioso). Pick the window seat and you can watch all the ducks going by. I recommend choosing some mains and sharing two or three with a friend as there are lots of good options (including lots of good options for vegetarians) and you will get a nice variety if you mix it up a bit. \u00a0We shared a dessert and that worked well too.Sauce-wise, the mains come with a nice orangey sweet and thick homemade sauce in a squeezy bottle, as well as a little pot of chilli sauce.For most main course options, you can choose to have either an arepa (sort of corn-fried bread Venezuelan version of a pita pocket, something along those lines), or a cachapa, which is more like a pancake. \u00a0Both are good (mix it up and get at least one of each).There's so much variety here on the menu, I think we'll be back to try some other stuff out. \u00a0Good cocktail menu and coffee options too.My one slight reservation was: in the 'Miss Venezuela' arepa, which contained mozzarella and tomato, the ingredients felt a bit substandard and non-authentic, like the sort of sandwich elements you would get in a Sainsbury's sandwich, transported into an arepa! \u00a0But, on the other hand, I did know what was in it when I ordered, so I only have myself to blame!",

    "text": "As a Venezuelan myself this place has the true taste of our homeland. The food is fresh, well prepared and filling!. We went for brunch Sunday for the first time and it was an interesting experience. Now coming from west London, it's not necessarily the closest location but we decided it was worth trying out. The food and ambiance was great but the service was seriously lacking. The staff was disorganised and all over the place. Even ordering a drink or the bill took some time. The place itself is really cozy and colorful, a mix of modernity and Latin vibe. Space wise, they could replace the hanging hammock chairs as they take up too much space and put in more tables. It seemed that it was super busy all day and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes. The food took too long and some drink and food order were messed up or forgotten. I had to have my salad after the meal was done.Anyways the food was worth all the wait and the disorganisation. The teque\u00f1os were nicely fried and served with a sauce. The \"desayuno\" special was excellent, with good portions of beans, cheese, eggs and plantains. The arepas were a good size too!.To finish it off I had a cold glass of the sugarcane lemonade Some suggestions for the place itself:- get rid of the iPad as a point of sale system, it's seemed slow and not able to handle many orders- keep someone at the door to greet, inform and control the flow of traffic- make the cachapas bigger!, they're tiny and I only got two - make the cups for milkshakes, lemonade a bit bigger, don't serve then in whiskey glasses with cocktail strawsThe food is what will make me return, the service on a Sunday, not so much!. Best of luck to Arepa and co!",

    "text": "Arepa and Co is in one of those rare old parts of English towns that are commercialised more because of the nearby waterway than any road. \u00a0It can be found to the West of Kingsland Road along with a small group of sibling cafes and workspaces, and is most easily arrived at via the Regent's Canal towpath. \u00a0It probably has actual road access somewhere but it's hard to tell and there's definitely some fun to be had eating somewhere more easily accessible by canal than by car.Their caipirinha is made with Venezualan rum (Santa Teresa) instead of Brazilian cachaca, for which the menu gives a sort-of apology. \u00a0This is a Venezualan restaurant, and they'll forgive you for wanting Brazil's drink as long as you have it their way. \u00a0It's good.The arepas, traditional grilled Venezualan maize-bread sandwiches, are large and served extremely hot. \u00a0These aren't snack arepas: you only need one for a filling meal. \u00a0My previous arepa experience required ordering arepas in pairs so it was a bit embarrassing having to take down a pair of Arepa and Co's lunch-size arepas in one sitting. \u00a0Not insurmountable and it did mean that by the end of my first lunch the second lunch had cooled down to edible temperature.I had a pelua arepa (pulled beef and cheddar) and pernil arepa (pork shoulder) both of which I covered in the provided salsa rosa, which is like a Hellmanns and ketchup marie rose only house-made and much tastier, with garlic.There's a small amount of outside seating, and inside there are large windows overlooking the canal. \u00a0Both are good places to watch the towpath, which caters to many different classes of foot and pedal traffic. \u00a0Most people are just out for a casual stroll but there are also some joggers as well as bicycles operating at all speeds from tourist to Lycra. \u00a0Every few minutes someone nearly knocks someone else into the canal which provides much entertainment during evening commuter hours and if you are sat inside you can enjoy it all without having to also hear the colourful oathing.",

Everything was amazing, but the beef deserves special mention: soft and juicy with a little bit of real guacamole on top. Seriously delicious. My partner tried the guarapito cocktail, which was also very nice: the passion fruit was sweet but well balanced with strong pirate's rum. The bottom line: I'll be a regular costumer and you should give it a try.",

However, if you're not suffering death by a thousand gin and tonics, then it's a very fun place to eat. The menu is offers various meats, cheese and eggs served either on an arepa or a cachapa. They also have amazing looking little sliders that kind of seem like tiny bites of delicious taco-goodness. My friends ordered the beef breakfast plate and the chicken breakfast. They come served with an arepa cornbread, beans, cheese, eggs and guac and looked insanely tasty. You should pile that cornbread up with goodness and dive in!Again, I was dying of booze so I had the heart of palm salad. I assumed it would be a crappy salad but it was fresh and light and full of flavour. I've never had heart of palm before and it was a great dish. The staff are cheery and very friendly so I definitely recommend a visit. But go hungry, not hungover!",

An arepa is essentially a sandwich but the bread is cornbread which is apparently gluten free and wheat free. It's also ridiculously tasty and the fillings are rich, hearty and delicious. Not your average egg mayo fare....There are a great range of cocktails, juices and milkshake - just reading the drinks \u00a0menu transports you to a warm, sunny place.Staff are from South America, so it feels really authentic - this is not some place set up by a gap year student who loved the food. This is a place made by traditional Venezuelans and their passion for their cuisine shows in the cooking. This is a great place to take a date (they're open for brunch if the dates gone very well) to impress them with your knowledge of London and it's awesome hidden places. Arepa is off the beaten track and it's worth making an effort to get there.On the day we visited they'd run out of all dessert so this is why I'm giving it four not five. Dessert is important!",

I love adventuring and searching out new places, so it's quite rare that I become complacent with somewhere and keep returning time and time again.However you just have to love Arepa! This little Peruvian corner of the ever so popular and trendy Haggerston.I love their favour combinations, their unique corn pockets, use of extremely fresh and traditional ingredients, but also their enthusiasm and overall joy in what they are doing.I love plantain - can't get enough of it, try it with white cheese here for a treat. And their Cassava chips? I can't get enough of these. I suspect they might inject these with some sort of crack designed specifically to my genetic code!They love their rum, and the house red is worth a pop, although I have yet to try the cocktails.Whilst few brave the hammocks, I've spent a few lazy visits here with a plate of tasty food, or hunched over a mind blowing hot chocolate (yes chocolate how it should be), watching the river outside and time go past.If you speak to the people working their, you'll find out just how new this place is, it only opened at the later end of last year by a couple, and a few of the staff are personal friends and one even explained to me 'more like family'.The only downside is that it's not cheap. But then for that rare something hearty and wholesome meal, I'm happy to shell out the extra bucks. Although don't get me wrong, it's not going to break the bank too! It's not unreasonably priced for area.Expect a lovely 'Mexican D\u00eda de Muertos' in soft focus feel, with some lovely artwork on the walls that I do believe that they are selling (although I will be sad to see it go, in all it's golden tinged glory).A very firm favourite and a short walk along the canal from the ever poplar Broadway market, that's well worth the venture.",

We came for dinner and had the yuca fries, two kinds of arepas and a cachapa with butter. The yuca fries were lovely, a nice starter portion for two people to share with the obviously hand-cut fries stacked in log-cabin style. They were crispy, just salty enough and came with a creamy garlicky sauce for dipping, then double-dipping, then triple-dipping because the sauce was that good. The arepa with pulled pork was awesome, with a yummy barbecue sauce. The one with the chicken and avocado wasn't really to our taste - it was good, but reminiscent of chicken salad with more of a mild, mayonnaise-y flavour that became a bit cloying after a few bites. It should be said, though, that the portions are HUGE. These are enough for a main, and should you just stop in for a snack, would more than fill you up. We didn't try any of the cocktails (bit pricey for canalside, but that's the way the wind is blowing in that area), though the staff gave us a big jug of tap water for the table. All in all, love the low-key vibe and huge portions, and would return to try the brunch on a sunny day. The food alone isn't mind-blowing or the main draw here, but combined with the atmosphere and location, it's a good spot for a casual and satisfying meal.",
