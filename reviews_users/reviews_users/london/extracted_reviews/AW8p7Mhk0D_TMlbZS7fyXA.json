    "text": "Organised a work function at Bounce a while back and have to say that their reservations team were great. They were available for questions and ensured everything was clear to me. I chose to pre-order drinks and food rather than a tab initially. They don't do any deals on food and drinks for corporate parties, which is a bit annoying seeing as we'll spending all this money, why not offer a discount or deal!!! Also meant it involved a lot of guess work as to how much food and drink to order for around 40 people. I probably overordered on the food and under on the drinks. Everything came out at once though, which I was not expecting and there wasn't nearly enough room for it all around the two tables we had reserved. Not only that but it meant that the hot pizzas then went cold quickly and food was lying around for a while. It is a good laugh and the food was delicious don't get me wrong, but improvements could be made considering the prices they charge.",

They have several ping pong tables that are reserved until the wee hours of the night in a regular basis. Best known for their pizzas, they also have a great selection of starters and other main dishes which you must try. Service always comes with a smile, and drinks are served cold. I recommend the local pale ale from Meantime! However, it can get a bit loud at times, and they often have a live DJ spinning tunes for the ones playing games...so, be prepared for that. I wouldn't come here expecting a quiet evening out. Otherwise, come here, and plan to have fun and enjoy the food, service and a game of ping pong where it originally started.",

The place is crammed with full size ping pong tables with seating all around them. I like the feeling of mild peril you get knowing that at any moment a ping pong ball may fall into your overly priced drink or bonk you on the head.Although there is an attached restaurant, we ordered bar food to our table on the ping pong parlour floor. Portion sizes are tiny. We were disappointed by the pizza strips. There weren't many and they tasted pretty bland. Food platters were a rip off for the amount of food we got. We played a few games and left hungry.Cocktails were good and decently priced. I had A Shrubbery (Rum, port, lemon, sugar syrup, raspberry vinegar and soda) lovely. Many in the party had Tipping Points (basically everything from the drinks cupboard in a glass) and they loved them. Other drinks were extortionate. In my opinion \u00a35 a pint is _very_ excessive (I am not a Londoner)I would recommend drinking and eating elsewhere and then going to Bounce for a bit of ping pong.If playing the ping pong hadn't been so fun this would definitely have been a 2 star review.",

    "text": "I do love a bar that's different. I normally hate a sports bar. Which of these will win out?! Well the former (judging by my star rating) because the USP for this bar was pretty cool indeed. And if you're not a well-toned athlete (like me) it really doesn't matter because you can drink!Boune, aptly named as Holborn's foremost in ping-pong bars, was a short descent below High Holborn. I met up with some friends here to try it out. There was only 4 of us so we couldn't book on the website, which was quite confusing to navigate I have to say. But they keep tables free for on the night so we went to counter and luckily got a slot for 30 minutes around a table in an hour from when we arrived. Perfect time for a drink at the bar then! \u00a313 for 30 minutes may sounds steep, but that \u00a33.25 each so all in all I'm not complaining.This place seems really busy when you first enter and it's because the bar is next to the entrance. But push past those people that stand in throughfares drinking and you can easily find a booth or some space nearer the tables to sit whilst you wait. We split some white wine (\u00a320 for house white is stupid because it wasn't that nice) and caught up until our time came to play. Thankfully I realised that 1) I remember hot to play ping pong, 2) that we were all of a similarly low standard and 3) running round a table for 30 minutes is knackering! Plus points, you can a bucket of balls (ooh err missus) and the staff are constantly picking up dropped balls to replenish you with, so you don't have to worry if you 'accidentally' smash the ball to the other side of the bar. Expect to get hit with someone's else's ball though, they do tend to fly around the place!All in all, a cool and different evening. I can see that companies bring people here for teambuilding type days, that's it's main market for sure",

    "text": "Discreetly situated next to a Boots shop on Holborn circus, Bounce is a hidden getaway for the suits crowd searching for some after-hours fun outside of the standard pub session. Descending the staircase into the cavernous space below, one feels that one is entering a gentleman's sports club/smoking den, only updated to the hipsterdom of 21st-century London and decidedly unisex. Anointed by a blue plaque declaring the unlikely space the site where the game was invented and patented, Bounce is a veritable temple to that most frivolous of frivolities, ping pong.On a recent visit for our team's Christmas dinner, we were told to arrive at 17:00 sharp for the pong session, which we were only able to book for a half hour at the start of the evening. Bounce is run like a Chinese ping pong camp, with players designated half-hour slots strictly adhered to by the iPad-wielding staff who hone in on a team within seconds of the session expiration. Bounce subscribes to the Benthamian principle 'the greatest pong action for the greatest number', which is admirable if frustrating for a server at match point suddenly tapped on the shoulder by the red-clad staff. It is understandable, though, why they must be so strict in managing a pong-crazy crowd engaging in post-work therapy landing smashes and getting smashed. Everyone wants a turn, and on our visit, the place was rammed.Bounce does one thing and it does it well, offering well over a dozen tables with buckets of balls and 5-6 racquets per table. It has a freewheeling, loose atmosphere, with staff sweeping the floors between tables with pool nets for scattered balls, resembling Dick Van Dyke chimney sweeps grooving to the well-selected tunes. Everyone seemed in good spirits, even those situated at booths in between courts, \u00a0who were sitting ducks for errant strikes, gamely plucking the balls from their hair and tossing them back to the players. Generous space between tables also allowed for some butterfly floating and bee stinging, with smashes liberally sought and rarely landed by a boozy crowd.After our time at pong camp ended, we shuffled off to the side and ordered a drink while we waited for our dinner table. Bounce has a decent selection of lagers at to-be-expected prices. Unfortunately we did not sample their cocktails, but the fraternal atmosphere encouraged beer drinking anyhow.Thankfully Bounce's restaurant area is set above the chaos, which offered a nice respite from the gym-and-gin atmosphere below. Still, I would not recommend coming to Bounce for a nice dinner. The menu is comprised of unexciting Italian fare, catering to the Strada and Pizza Express crowd. Although we had to choose from a set Christmas menu, most if not all of the dishes appear on the standard menu. The dinner started well enough, with tasty starters accompanied by a glass of prosecco. The mains, however, were a bit of a mixed bag, and were served with subpar bottles of wine. The biggest disappointment proved to be the Eton mess, which was all mess, no Eton, having been served with no merengue at all.Still, at \u00a344.50 a head, the dinner served its purpose on a work-sponsored event, where a modicum of meat is mandatory for avoiding \u00a0a drunken meltdown before the boss. The main qualm we had was with Bounce's service, which was wobblier than our own service game by the end of the night. The servers were downright confused by the size and complexity of our group, even with the set menu. They had mixed up the number of each dish requested, but instead of tackling each diner's request on an ad hoc basis, unleashed their harried servers on our group, circumnavigating the table multiple times trying to find a place to set down the misordered items, despite our protestations. It appears there may have been a mix-up with the ordering by email, but even so, the waitress should have redressed the issue by quickly taking stock of each order and sending out new tickets, rather than supplicating us to take the dishes at hand. Unfortunately the poor service extended to the ping pong camp counsellors as well, who short-changed us twice on the pong table bookings (shaving off 5 minutes each time) and rebuffed our entreaties with the gruffness of a gulag guard.On the whole, then, Bounce is a quirky venue suitable for large groups looking for a mid-week diversion outside of the Weatherspoons crawl. At \u00a313 for a half-hour table's booking at peak time, I would not recommend it as an outing for the cash-strapped, which perhaps explains its shrewd City location. For a casual game with a few friends, I would recommend any number of good bars across the city with free ping pong tables, including the Book Club in Shoreditch and Doodle Bar in Battersea. Still, we all had an enjoyable evening and would happily be scooped up by Bounce's floor-sweeping staff to go back in the bucket for another round -- provided the company continues to pay for the privilege.",

I just loved the atmosphere (the gin probably helped with that) - the place is huge and heaving and everyone seems to be having a great time whether they're on a table or not.I have particular love for the DJ who I wanted to hi-five for the excellent old school tunes they were playing, and also whoever it is that flips the on the UV lights later in the eve. As if it wasn't tricky enough playing table tennis when you can see the ball! I have to say I actually surprised everyone (mostly myself) by being pretty good on my first go. My later performance at the table showed it was a bit of a fluke though!I didn't think much of the cocktail I ordered but switching to (strong!) G&Ts was a good decision. A couple of us also shared a goat's cheese and caramelised onion pizza later in the eve to line the stomach which was delicious - I'd eat goat's cheese off just about anything but I especially enjoyed this lovely light dough.Your only issue is going to be getting a table - make sure to book ahead to avoid disappointment, and I recommend a later slot in the evening than you think you'll need in order for everyone to get warmed up at the bar. Other than that, my tips would be to use the cloakroom (it's free, hurrah!), watch out for flying balls heading into your drink and avoid white underwear for when the UV lights come on. Enjoy!",

You can book the table for 1/2 hour slots at a time and bats and balls are provided with the rental of the table. But the best is yet to come...the staff come around every now and then to check you are well stocked up with alcohol. They take your debit/credit card, but don't worry, they keep it behind the bar and give you a token/key just so you don't run away without paying ;)Do try the restaurant if you go to Bounce. They offer a wide range of starters, sharers, mains and deserts for any number of people. From what I've seen its great for parties.Make sure you book well in advance as this place can get busy, very quickly!",

    "text": "Excellent fun in a very large location. There are loads of tables here. Whether you'd like to eat, play or just watch, there is an activity for everyone. We were here for a corporate event which was structured by splitting us into two groups competing against each other. Whilst not entirely appealing to those who like table tennis it did help to balance enjoyment for those that were new to the game and others who had played more than a few games.Food was brought out and was pretty good. We had tapas style initially followed by pizza and the usual bar food. The great thing is that there are millions of balls so you never need to go far to hunt for one. Plus the staff have these excellent tools to simply scoop all the balls up into a net saving you and them the trouble!I did look at normal prices and it can get a bit pricey. If you're playing doubles that can bring the cost down quite a bit.In all I would recommend this place for the cool atmosphere and vibe, good food and fun staff, and most importantly it's proper ping pong on tables that aren't falling apart. The only real downside are the prices, but given the location and the crowd it's to be expected.",

It was table tennis but better as you didn't even have to chase after the balls! You're given a little bucket of balls and they're filled up by the people walking round scooping up all the stray ones. A word of warning though. An hour goes too fast in this place. Blink and your time is up as you're just having too much fun. I'd say four people is probably ideal for one table for an hour. Many more and you wouldn't get to play much. The reason this place lost a star from me is because I do think it's a little pricey and they didn't make it easy for us to use the voucher. They did let us eventually but it did take a bit of hassle.If there's an offer on here in the future I'd definitely be up for another visit. It's reignited my table tennis passion!",

Great place to lose your breath trying to bat the ping pong ball every which way and the waitresses were lovely. Plus, Bounce entices you with the smell of food and prospect of pizza sharing its space with a restaurant section (which also happens to mask your lingering sweaty odours.) I'd definitely recommend it for a rainy day or any day really.My two tips would be:1) If you're counting the pennies, round up about four friends as opposed to two to bring the cost of hiring a table down.2) Get there EARLY as they're VERY punctual and you'll lose out on some precious ping pong time allotted to you.",

Having spent an hour in the car, curtesy of an extensive scenic route gifted to us by our cab driver, we were getting more than a little tetchy about getting to our destination. Pulling up outside a tiny doorway, still not knowing what we were going to be doing, we headed downstairs into Bounce. \u00a0By the time I hit the second flight of stairs, I knew I hated everything about it. A heaving, crowded,noisy sea of people, swirling around the bar, ping pong tables and mini tables covered with pitchers, cocktails and beers; all set against a pounding 'musical' bassline.In fact, that bassline was so loud and distorted, that you were forced to shout at even your closest buddy.We had a booked at the back of Bounce, on a raised stair platform, that faced onto the \u00a0restaurant which was just starting to get busy. Right about now, in one of my regular Yelp reviews, \u00a0I'd usually run you through the decor, food and drinks, but as I stayed precisely 30 minutes before leaving, so repelled was I by the people sardine/boom box effect, I don't have much else to say about the place.If you're a 20something who wants a great lively joint to hangout with friends or meet your buddies after work, then Bounce is just for you. If you're over 30 and want a chilled beer or three in fun surroundings, that allow you to hear what your buddies are sayng, then unless you like shouting, I'd give Bounce a miss.",

Check, check and checkThis is an awesome space in the often empty Holborn Circus area of London. It's entrance sandwiched between a Boots and the entrance to an office block (and behind a pillar) it can be easily missed. However, head downstairs and you find yourself in a large open room with lots of ping pong balls flying, a restaurant and a large bar. Book a table and it's yours, with your ping pong ball bucket helpfully refilled by various staff members running around with nets. I gather from those sitting at some of the tables (there are some amongst the the tables themselves) that the orientation of the ping pong tables could be improved, having the seats at the end of the tables meant that balls would quite often hit people when someone got a little over exuberant with their strokes... They serve Blue Moon on tap, which is one of my favourite US craft beers and the food is generally very good, we ordered various different pizzas and flatbread which all arrive very quickly and went down a treat!",
