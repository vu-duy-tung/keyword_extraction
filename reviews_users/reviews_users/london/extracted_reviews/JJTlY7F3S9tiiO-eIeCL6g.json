    "text": "This is a top notch old school fish & chip shop (surprisingly hard to find in London) much loved by the folk who have the good fortune to live or work in the area.It's very popular for a take away at lunch time with queues out the door most of the time but don't let that put you off \u00a0these guys are quick and efficient so you will rarely wait more than 10 minutes for your fishy feast. If you don't fancy eating fish & chips in the street, the nearby park or at a desk in the office there is a sit down option in the restaurant at the back of the shop which has plenty of seating (walk in past the queue outside and you will be found somewhere to perch).The fish is fresh and has plenty of flavour. The crisp golden batter keeps it nice and moist and when teamed up with a small portion of perfectly cooked chips this is a British classic which will leave you stuffed and well satisfied for under \u00a37 (if you are not famished a portion between two might suffice). I'm a haddock man myself but if you want something a little more adventurous there is skate and calamari on the menu as well as an array of chicken, burgers, sausages and pies.If you are hungry in the Westminster area and fancy a taste of quality traditional British street food then you could do a lot worse than join the queue at The Laughing Halibut.",

The name itself caught our attention. The distinct smell of fried chips filled the street. We knew we were in the right place. The establishment was simple and functional. The free WiFi was a very nice touch. We ordered the standard fish and chips and coca-cola. Our drinks arrived chilled without any ice in a large glass. The fish and chips followed shortly. The serving portions were spot on. The chips was perfectly fried and the fish was a nice balance of crispy and soft. The table had the standard tartar sauce, HP sauce, and packets of ketchup. The meal was reasonably priced at \u00a319.10 for two fish and chips with cokes. I will definitely pay this place a visit again when I return to London.",

When I visited, there was a line out the door, but the staff moved quickly. They do have a sit down area, but the to-go is what most people do. The fish options are dependent on the day. They were out of halibut so I got cod which was terrific. For London, I got a huge portion for a very reasonable price. It was all made fresh, and the staff was quick and efficient taking my order and money. I would recommend most people sharing a full order. It truly is quite large. The chips/fries/whatever were quite meh. They got soggy rather quickly and they were under-seasoned. The fish itself was very well breaded and the salt and vinegar was perfect despite just being sort of tossed on. I will note that because it is so freshly made, it is hot. I wish I could have just let it sit and cool for awhile, but I was in a hurry at the time. Also, it's a bit hard to eat. It's all in a paper bag and greasy as hell. Of course, that is to be expected, but just be aware to get some napkins or utensils. There is a park just down around the corner where a bunch of business men and I sat down to munch down on our meals. The food definitely attracted some pigeons, and I was glad that I had wet wipes for cleanup. Overall, I would say this is a great stop for anybody. It's not the best meal in the world, but so far as cheap good food, it's hard to beat. Just watch your cholesterol.",

My hubby ordered halibut and chips that's also very delicious. The chicken wings are okay though not as good as the fish and chips. I recommend this place to get your fish and chips crave fixed.

    "text": "Saw that this place had some good reviews and we wanted to try some Fish and Chips while we were in London as many of the other reviewers here did. As far as food goes, we got the Haddock and a Chicken and Mushroom Pie, both came with chips or fries to Americans. The Pie was pretty decent, the fish and chips were nothing to write home about. The only thing that made the fish and chips decent was the tartare sauce. Service was poor and inattentive. Only time they came around was to try to whisk away the plates before we were quite done with our chips. \u00a0Before entering, we asked to make sure if they take credit. The employee turned to who I thought was probably the manager or owner of the establishment who said yes, it works, but no American Express. He urged us to sit down and we immediately saw signs saying that they are not accepting credit because their machine is broken. We thought this was a bit weird, but figured not only did the employee ask a superior, they also specified which card would not be accepted.When it came time to pay, I pulled out a visa credit card, to which the waitress pointed to a sign saying they cant take credit. I replied that I checked before ordering and we were assured we could pay with credit. They asked the same manager who rolls his eyes before telling her to try to run the card, during which, unsurprisingly the machine fails to connect. I ended up having to go find an ATM to pay (something I was trying to avoid since I would only be in town shortly). \u00a0I would not waste my time here for the food for a second time and I certainly would recommend people stay away from here for the business practice alone. Don't knowingly force people into a situation they don't want to be in when they are trying to handle business in a considerate manner to begin with. As we left, the poor business ethics left a worse taste in our mouths than the food did.",

    "text": "For my first visit to England, Laughing Halibut definitely showed me how delicious fish and chips could be. There are so many different types of fish to choose from, and for the price, anything on the menu is an amazing deal. Especially looking at some of the other restaurants in London, the price point of the Laughing Halibut was so refreshing - anyone can get a deliciously filling meal for less than 10 pounds!Regular is definitely enough of a portion to fill a normal person's stomach, but if you feel like you have a monstrous appetite, go for the Large, and see if you can handle it. My whole family ordered the Regular size, and we wound up taking a lot of food back home. The fish just tasted so, so fresh. I've had some mediocre fish and chips back home in America, and it just does not compare at all. I adored my haddock - I definitely recommend the haddock if you're going for a traditional fish and chips meal. My dad had the cod, and it was a little drier and not as tasty in my opinion. I was worried that the chips would be too dry (because I looked at the Yelp photos beforehand), but I was very pleasantly surprised. The chips were crispy and not too oily and were a delightful accompaniment to my fish. I will say though that though the fish tastes fresh, it is coated with batter and deep fried to perfection. Obviously, if you're not into fried foods, this place would not be the place for you (but neither will any fish and chips place be ideal for you). Just at the Laughing Halibut in particular, you can definitely taste the oil and the crunch of the fried batter before you get to the fish. It was wonderful for me for the first few bites but got admittedly a little overwhelming as I was working my way through the dish.Service is super friendly as well. They joke around and made me and my family feel at home and welcome since they probably could spot that we were not from the area. Lots of other reviews mentioned that it would be crowded, but we came on a weekday evening an hour before closing time, and it was not crowded at all - plenty of room! I guess we just got lucky. Oh, and there's also free wi-fi, which is fantastic.I absolutely loved my trip to Laughing Halibut. I definitely recommend a visit here for anyone who wants a taste of what real fish and chips are all about.",

This no-frills eatery allows you to dine in or take out. Tried the halibut (of course) and it did not disappoint! Just the right amount of crispy fried crust surrounding a beautiful flaky white fish. The fish is locally sourced from Billingsgate Market, so you know it's excellent. They make everything to order, so it's fresh and piping hot when it comes to you. The thick-cut \"chips\" are great, especially when paired with the gravy. Their mushy peas are interesting, with a traditional creamy texture--definitely a must-try.

    "text": "\"Fish & chips\" is an interesting cuisine option - it's almost universally invoked with a modicum of enthusiasm, and is very much regarded as an English cultural cornerstone - and though it's ostensibly a simple meal, there's definitely a huge variation in quality. One thing that's always puzzled me, in fact, is how people maintain their enthusiasm for fish & chips from their local chippy when it's obviously terrible. Having walked past The Laughing Halibut many-a lunchtime to see a queue stretching out the door and towards the corner of the street I was keen to give them a try and see what the fuss was about. With so many nice places to choose from in the immediate area, why on earth would you line up for 15 to 20 valuable minutes for a meal which flies in the face of popular health wisdom, with an eager look on your face!? Turns out - I discovered, making a special weekend trip in - it's because these guys really know their way around a piece of cod. Crispy golden battered fish sits amid a sizeable pile of chips which, once I'd gotten them back to the office, were suitably crunchy (without being crispy) and tasty as well! (My chip vocab is a little lacking) They weren't the sad anaemic looking excuses you sometimes discover next to your fish. Similarly, the fish was tasty, with just the right thickness & texture of batter, and - perhaps it was coincidence - not a single bone. The whole thing seemed quite well-priced for the amount of food you got - probably a serve of chips & 2 bits of cod could satisfy 2 people, and set you back somewhere in the region of 10 or 11 quid. There's other types of fish there, but I've not had the chance to get anywhere near the menu since that day, so you'll have to go find out yourself. There's a good reason why The Laughing Halibut's a local point of reference when giving directions - it's been there a good few years now, and judging by the following they've got it'll be there a few more yet.",

The food is fabulous in that deep-fried-I-want-to-kill-myself sort of way, well worth it.The chips are fantastic, though if you're American one must ask for vinegar (how do they know? Is it the accent?). The large chips are enough to feed about 8 people really, so consider that if you're getting anything other than chips. I had to toss about half the output of Ireland - McDonald's supersize has nothing on these chips.All in all, a big win for a nice little spot from which I will gorge myself time and time again.",

They give a big piece of fish but the chips are not crisp (I'm finding that must be the norm in England).The help is friendly. Their credit card machine was not working.

It was our first meal of the day and we ended up eating the fish but was unable to finish the fries. The cod was delicious, tender and juicy. The paddock was a different type of fish, a bit more dry and fishy than cod but not bad if you like that type of fish. Prices were reasonable as well. I picked it due to its location, close to Buckingham and Westminister Abbey and didn't regret it. I would recommend to others.",

The fish was delicious, flakey, and the crust was not as dried and thick as most fish and chips spots that I've tried. I also could not stop eating the fries. I was able to finish my whole meal and wanted another (however, I had to stop myself).My only complaint would be with the surge of tourists visiting this joint, I could tell that the waiters was not too keen on serving us. I wish there was more hospitality in their service or at least made me feel a little more welcomed. Would I come here again? Probably not.

The quantity was decent and there was quite a lot of fish, but I overall didn't find the flavors to be that great and the meal felt relatively heavy.Also note: I have a very high standard for fish and chips because I've gotten it so many times from so many places. For a place in London, I was expecting a bit better, but it definitely wasn't a bad meal by any means. I'd probably just look for a place that can offer you fish and chips for a little bit cheaper.",

Flying from Hawaii to London was lengthy, so we were looking for a place that served up authentic and tasty London yums to curb the jet lag. For the record, I am no fish-n-chips officiant, and I have only been to London one other time before this back in 2011. So to find a good restaurant in the middle of the bustling city, I used none other than my trusty Yelp app and sought out TLH just a couple blocks away from us! The restaurant was easy to find on the map, but it is a small eatery so keep your eyes open! The dining room can probably fit no more than ten tables, but the areas are clean. The restaurant is operated by a very nice family! I was able to meet the father, son and daughter and chat with them for a bit. Turns out they spoke Turkish and started their restaurant in London in hopes of a better life.Our group of four tried the haddock and halibut. Both fish were tasty-- the haddock was flaky and the halibut was moist. The batter was nice on both fish; not too oily or thick so the flavor of the fish meat was well received. Portion sizes are good and even the big boys got full off their meal! For what it's worth, I enjoyed TLH and the service we received from the staff. Thank You for starting our journey off on the right foot!",

The stars are strictly for the halibut. Being American we over season everything and they don't really season in Europe so the fries were bland. But just for the halibut alone it's worth the visit here for sure. My wife had the southern chicken and said it was pretty good and had a little kick to it. Get the halibut!",

I don't have a lot of compare to, but this place seems pretty decent.Located on an alleyway with several food stands, this place is very casual. You walk in, sit down, order a fish dish off their menu. Very simple. Friendly workers too.We ordered the large halibut & chips for 15 euro...a tad pricey, however, the piece of fish was humongous....one order was able to make 2 people content, especially with the amount of freshly cut chips (fries) they supplied. The fresh and flaky chunk of fish came with tartar sauce, but I opted for ranch instead. Batter was light & crispy...not too thick at all. Oh yes, they were also nice enough to find me a huge bottle of the ranch which I kept all to myself for the duration of my meal ;) BTW they take credit cards!",

This place was very clean so don't let outside appearances sway you. We came here after a walking tour that ended relatively close by. There was a full lunch crowd, mostly local it seemed. My only complaint would be pricing- a little steep compared to a (IMO) chippy I also visited that had similar quality product. And by no frills I mean tarter and mayonnaise in packets- yeah not fancy. But I will say the haddock I received was a tremendous portion and was crispy on the outside while being flakey on the inside. The chips were piping hot, but, flavorless, which I found at other London joints-definitely not like the Netherlands and Belgium. My husband had a breakfast dish- an over medium egg, pork sausage, and chips. The pork sausage was good- flavorful, cooked well. The hot lemon tea was warming on the gloomy London day. Pay at the register after you're finished. I'd definitely return here again if I wanted a good meal in London.",

The halibut is 50% more expensive than the other fishes, yet I prefer the cod which is more moist. They cook your fish on order, so the wait was incredibly long.",

    "text": "This is a top notch \"old school\" fish & chip shop (surprisingly hard to find in London) much loved by the folk who have the good fortune to live or work in the area.It's very popular for a take away at lunch time with queues out the door most of the time but don't let that put you off - these guys are quick and efficient so you will rarely wait more than 10 minutes for your fishy feast. If you don't fancy eating fish & chips in the street, the nearby park or at a desk in the office there is a sit down option in the \"restaurant\" at the back of the shop which has plenty of seating (walk in past the queue outside and you will be found somewhere to perch).The fish is fresh and has plenty of flavour. The crisp golden batter keeps it nice and moist and when teamed up with a small portion of perfectly cooked chips this is a British classic which will leave you stuffed and well satisfied for under \u00a37 (if you are not famished a portion between two might suffice). I'm a haddock man myself but if you want something a little more adventurous there is skate and calamari on the menu as well as an array of chicken, burgers, sausages and pies.If you are hungry in the Westminster area and fancy a taste of quality traditional British \"street\" food then you could do a lot worse than join the queue at The Laughing Halibut.",

She's not really a pie fan either (she was just going along), but she wiped out the whole thing. She's still not a huge fan of the pie concept, though maybe she's being won over.Real fish and chips shops that don't seem to prefer to traffic in kabobs are difficult to find in London, these days, so The Laughing Halibut is a great destination for sampling the form.",

When taking a bite, the batter was more obvious than the fish itself. This is not a good indicator. It felt too oily and I discarded it before I had had half of it. The fish itself was too flaky and had little substance. It may be because it was overcooked, or it may be the nature of my choice of fish (I had the plaice).The chips that came with the fish were fine and you got plenty for the price you paid. A school kid looking for an after school treat could do worse. However, I overheard there being a minimum charge of \u00a35, so you wouldn't be getting chips on their own.",

Every week on Wednesday my father would pick me up and I'd jump out of the car to get a quick takeaway of chips.I've been going for many years and I honestly think it's the best fish and chips shop I've ever been to.They also refurbished the restaurant a couple of years ago so the whole shop is much more appealing than before.It is a must!",

The 2 waiters weren't very friendly but I think that's somewhat normal in the UK. They were out of halibut but we got cod and chips. The food was good (and greasy!). It's not something I could eat everyday but it seemed pretty authentic!",

You know it's good when the Coffee place next door has a sign in front to not form a queue to block their entrance. \u00a0As a novice, I formed the queue not realizing that you can just go directly inside if you are not doing take away. My bad. Our friendly server recommended the haddock and cod. The women working here are awesome. Efficient and willing to cover each other to meet needs of the dining area. Genuinely smiling and hospitable. Fish was hot and crispy and once I squeezed the lemon wedge across the fish, our family dove right in. Mushy peas and gravy seemed to be a traditional favorite here so I jumped on that band wagon and added it to our Friday Fish Fry. I loved dipping my chips in the gravy which was thick and savory. Great place for the best fish and chips in London, if you are like me checking off a foodie list.",

    "text": "I know nothing about British food but I am lucky enough to be here on business and while stumbling around in a nauseated jet-lagged state, I realized part of my problem was hunger. It was probably fate that when I looked up, from my cell phone map, I was standing in front of this shop. I was suspicious at first since I was close to tourist ground zero but upon ducking inside, the place was full of locals (or at least a lot of people faking really good British accents) which I took as a good sign. Service is friendly and it seems to be run by a family with the patriarch manning the fryolator in a pristine white chef jacket. I was feeling better already. A plate of fried scampi and chips with a side of mushy peas later and all was right in the world. To be fair, this place gets 4 stars for what it is...an inexpensive chip shoppe with persons skilled in the art of frying food at a fair price with fast and friendly service. The 5th star is a miss for me at a place like this because the mayo and tartar sauces come in small packets from an industrial supplier (too generic) and their traditional pies are prepackaged from another industrial supplier. If they could make these things on premises, the 5th star would have been a given. Now if only they had a license to serve a proper pint, that would put them totally over the top!",
