It's quite a dark place but with the atmosphere of being in a cave a la Aladdin I'm sure. The chef was a bit of a genie, conjuring up a huge portion of rice and lamb kebab with a yoghurt sauce to taste - all for the low price of only six pounds. They are very nice in there also, the service is good and they enjoy a laugh. I saw some of the other customers meals and they looked great too. It's definitely a place where I will be going back for more",

After visiting Le Porte De Indes a couple of weeks ago and having an absolutely appalling time i wanted to go somewhere that was renowned for good food. I was amazed at this place. My friend and I visited last night and we had GREAT food at a VERY reasonable price. We ordered two different mains, 3 drinks and a side of rice and it only came to \u00a322 in comparison to the \u00a380 we paid at Le Porte De Indes. The food was cooked to perfection and was absolutely fab, mouth wateringly succulent. The bread is amazing, it takes up the whole table, it is soft and covered in sesame seeds, you have to try it. We will definitely be going back to this gem of a restaurant, whether we eat in or get a takeout this is going to become one of our fave haunts!! Admittedly the decor is mediocre and the restaurant itself is tiny, but the food and the value far outweighs all of this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

This place oozes authenticity (for most of our meal, we were the only white folks in the place), and the food is stellar. We had simple kebabs, but the flavor of the meat was spot-on. I also started with a platter of pickles while my friend had the hummous with house bread, which was enormous (and she ordered the small size!). I also had the yogurt drink, which was different from anything I'd had before but complemented the meal well. One downside: I picked Patogh because it was supposedly baby-friendly, and we were traveling with our 15-month-old. They didn't have ANY high chairs, which was bad since our little one was antsy. Instead, I held her in our sling and she napped during dinner. Oh well.",

It's tucked down a side street in the 'Persian Quarter' of London, and is really small. It only seats about 20 people max, with only space for 10 downstairs. it's really cramped, and the staff are quite happy to shove you right against a wall to make space. However, the food makes up for it. They do these giant breads, which are like thinner naan, but with a slightly different flavour. I recommend getting one to share. I usually go for the chicken with saffron rice, which is really well cooked and flavoured. I've been with friends who've had the baby chicken, and the lamb kebab, and everyone raved about them. There's a couple of really nice pubs nearby, which are a great place to go to after gorging on Persian food. I've been to Patoghs with friends, and on my own, and have seen many couples there as well. Patoghs is truely an unsung gem.",

This small family owned restaurant features extraordinary sized special bread. It tastes a little bit different from Naan but delicious nonetheless with some hummus and taziki. They don't serve wine, but here's the kicker there is no corkage fee! Waitrose and Somerfield are but 2 min away to supply you with your alcoholic beverage(s) for the night. Mains are 6-7 quid. I recommend the Lamb kebab which is stunningly simple coupled with a roasted tomato and rice. Word to the Wise this place is very small so a big group would not be ideal. But it would be perfect for 4 people. Total price for a meal will run you about \u00a39 to \u00a310. I implore anyone to eat here!",

    "text": "OK - I used to be a big fan of yelp. Lately, however, I've grown disillusioned because the recommendations have consistently not lived up to my expectations. I'm writing this review JUST because I saw that this place is ranked the best Persian/Iranian restaurant in London. It most definitely is not!!!! I used to be a big fan of Patogh, but it was never my favorite (and I am Iranian, so I know what I am talking about). It's not even the best Iranian restaurant on Edgware Road. However, the standards have been slipping in my opinion.First of all, the restaurant is extremely small - literally 5 or 6 tables in the entire place, with maybe 20 patrons in total being able to squeeze themselves in at any given moment. Second, The only outstanding thing about this place is the bread. The meat and chicken are distinctly average, and more than once have I gotten a takeaway from here and found the chicken to be burnt to a crisp and completely unacceptable. Third, the menu is very, very limited. No kashkeh bademjan, mirza ghasemi, khoresht of any kind (that I can remember). Conclusion: this is definitely not the best Iranian fare in London. If you find yourself craving a chelo-kabab in the area, go to Kandoo (much better food and a more authentically Iranian menu). Mohsen, Yas, Al Borz, \u00a0Alounak are also all vastly superior to Patogh - and that's just a start. Do not waste your time here.",

Superbly seasoned with just the right amount of spices and cooked to perfection, the lamb meat was crispy on the outside and tender and moist inside. \u00a0Don't forget to try the hot sauce (seemed to be a harissa) on the table and ask for some of their yogurt on the side.

    "text": "To step in to this place is to walk into a wonderful, olde worlde little cavern of bronze coloured walls ,wooden benches, oil filled lanterns amidst several beautiful paintings depicting 17th century ishafan landscapes. You can imagine 17th century ottoman knights visiting such a place at the end of a hard days battle and resting their trusty shields and swords on the heavy duty wooden tables before sinking their teeth into the meats on offer here.I have been visiting this hidden gem for 5 years now and nothing ever changes.Reading some of the reviews of Patogh on here it is to the credit of us as discerning consumers that at a time of national calamity \u00a0our economy in ruins, half the population in negative equity and the other half on Facebook,our youth rioting and lying drunk in the gutters, and our elderly lookig for a salubrious gutter in which to reside, it is to the credit of our spirit as a nation of restaraunt goers that at such a time so many on here can find the energy to complain the food was great but the waiters didnt tallk to me!Such people miss the essence of this place. There is only 1 waiter , there are 2 elderly cooks, making food iwith meticulous care and pride in a open plan kitchen/counter area the size of the average suburban semi detached living room with seating for ten downstairs and the same upstairs. Yet despite this the food and premises are unscropously hygienic and fresh and the food amongst the best value in the West End.The menu has not changed in the time i have been going there, service is always very fast, it can be difficult to get tables at peak times, and when u do u will be served your food fresh off the grill within 6-7 minutes and will probably have eaten it and left within 25 minutes. But you will be rewarded with the biggest nan bread in london quaintly listed on the menu as big bread, glazed with olive oil and encrusted with sesame seeds , or alternatively saffron rice and a choice of either chicken or lamb minced meat skewers, or baby chicken., the adventurous u can buy a side of grilled chillies or okra.and that is basically the food menu! For drinks there is pepsi/fanta/water and a drink called Dog which is a refreshing yoghurt and coriander beverage.Prices for either rice or one of these huge breads with your meat of choice is an incredible \u00a36! Your salad will be freshly cut and consist of baked tomato, onions,cabbage,mint,green chillie,lemon,and radishes. Dont be misled by others descriptions, to sit in this place for even 5 minutes is to be taken to another world, perhaps a small downtown iranian cafe off the beaten track with its wooden bench tables and quite ambience. And for the record, the 2 cooks always say hello and goodbye! Just understand the culture.. this is a persian joint run by 2 older gentleman who are cooking non stop yet go about it so quietly and calmly! It isnt suitable for tuxedoed partygoers looking for a long raucous night out, and isnt suitable for screaming kids and pushchair toting bingo winged soccer moms.For perhaps a couple or a party of 3-4 connosseurs seeking a quick teleportation into a far away land and its delicious street cuisine try Patogh! If you want a more extensive selection of Iranian food and the full night out dining experience try one of the iranians on edgeware road.",

    "text": "The first opinion of this restaurant may sound snobbish due to the rugged interior design of plain mud-coloured walls, narrow stairs leading to the first floor of laid out wooden tables and benches and a rather quirky manner of service offered. Otherwise, this lovely Persian restaurant is a true hidden but humble gem. Kebab is the main food served here with fresh ingredient and very tasty rice dishes. I went for the chicken kebab, which was deliciously cooked with lemon marinade and some other ingredients I probably don't know! Totally just under \u00a310, bargain! Talking about quirky service: food is served in tin dishes and interestingly no alcohol is served in this restaurant, so for all those who like a bottle of beer with their meal,be careful! don't know if you can sneak it in. If you are up for taste and not design, then this restaurant would meet your expectation or maybe you just want to impress your friends. Good service even though the waiters hardly make any conversation with you, if that's not your cup of tea then you should be fine. My verdict: cheap, but tasty.",

I did not give this place 5 stars because I realise not everyone is looking to be squeezed in a small upstairs room, rubbing elbows with strangers. But, if a restaurant is to be judged by the sheer goodness of food alone, this is truly a 5-star spot. For very reasonable prices, you can relish fine Persian fare, ranging from their huge fluggy flatbread, grilled chillies and onions, hummus, chicken and lamb grills on rice and spicy sauces. This place is highly recommended for those who can appreciate amazing food without the ambience to match. Also, go in a small group (less than 4 people) given the space of the place, expect the service to be quick and don't expect to linger after wrapping up your meal. It's a BYOB place with no corkage and if I remember correctly, they operate only on cash.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place based on the good reviews on Yelp and the fact that it was reasonably close to the hotel. It's a tiny little place, at least the downstairs, with a tiny little busy kitchen that we got a table right next to after a 20 min wait (that was spent at the lovely bar just a bit further down the street, Lord Wargrave/Wargrave Arms). Great ambiance, busy, lots of people came in for take out. The food was good (and I loved the huge bread!), but it was not amazing. No alcohol on the menu but noticed that people brought their own. The one big minus for me was that I noticed that the guy who prepared most of the food that left the kitchen, handled money then used his unwashed hands to put salad on plates, etc. This didn't just happen once by accident but several times just while we were in. Without this experience I would have given them a 4/5, so when reading this know that I may have been biased by my germaphobic tendencies...",

Charcoal and a little like a high end kebab place.Service is pleasant enough, though the menu is a little thin. I came here because of a craving for Persian food, and came away disappointed. There large bread which you must get with dips, was great, as was the minced chicken dish with rice. But nothing was shout our \"Persian\". It could easily have passed for Turkish/Mediterranean. The lamb stew dish I ordered was pretty watery and lacked any flavour at all really. Even when lamb is supposed to be one of those stronger meats.In all, the highlight was that the place was cheap, but not cheap enough to warrant a second visit. The minced chicken was good, but there are plenty other charcoal/grilled meat restaurants that do this well.The place is really tiny, so it can be problematic getting a table, but we were here during Ramadan so it was pretty quiet.",

    "text": "I'd read the reviews for Patogh on Yelp and Google and had seen that they were quite mixed. However it came up as Yelp's No. 1 Middle Eastern restaurant around Edgeware Road, so I thought I'd give it a go.I've been to Iran, and I thought that this looked like quite an authentic place to bring a friend who's not been himself...The atmosphere of the place is great, really reminiscent of an Iranian place. A bit cramped though, so they would squeeze three people around a table for two. Upstairs was also quite cold. All this could be forgiven though, if the food tasted as good as it looked.... However I must concur with the other reviews below. The humous lacked any sort of flavour and the meet was insufficiently marinated/seasoned. We had a minced lamb kebab and a boneless chicken kebab... The latter didn't really have any sumac flavour (the spice that would give it the Iranian flavour). The salad vegetables were anaemic even by British standards. As other people have mentioned, the only redeeming factor was the Special Iranian Bread. Very authentic and HUGE (\u00a35), get the small one if you're only a couple. Price wise, it isn't very expensive, but I would still say it's overpriced for the quality of the food on offer. There are much better Iranian places in London, I'm sure....",

The venue is very small spread over two floors, so expect a queue if you are visiting especially for dinner. You are put where there is space, so you may be sharing with another couple or a family. The waiting staff has a great memory; my friend has frequented this restaurant at least 3 times, and the waiter has recognised him and gave us a free starter of houmous and bread, which is absolutely ginormous. The houmous isn't particularly flavoursome, as other reviewers might have noted, but it seems to be a tradition to add salt to it judging by the actions of other patrons. Perhaps that's just the Peruvian / Iranian way...?I had the lamb cutlet and it was tender and well seasoned, while my friend had the lamb shish kebab which was juicy and tasty.

The kids weren't hungry so we ordered for three adults but were told that we had to order for them as their policy is if 5 are seated then you must order 5 main meals. So I asked, \"would you rather have three orders or none?\" Their answer.....\"none\". Stupid is an understatement. Business acumen = 0. But then the owner being from Afghanistan says a lot. No common sense and money grabbing bastards.",

Was taken aback by the everyone has to have a main course and the money having to be cash but we got through that. Water is going to be bottled which is another charge. But the bill was reasonable overall. The biggest drawback of the place is that it is very small, dated, and cramped. Worth a shot for the experience",

There is chili sauce and chili powder (neither is very spicy) if you want to give it a bit of a kick. It came with an Iranian version of tzatziki, which went well with anything: the bread, the salad, or the lamb. Despite them calling it a \"small\" bread, it is huge - much too large for one person, but I can't complain as they're only charging \u00a32 for it.",

I haven't had lamb in a long time and it reminded me why I loved it so much. When we sat down, they gave us hummus and giant bread to start, on the house. It was yummy! We couldn't finish the bread but I would have if I could! Our dishes were delicious, of course! It's a no-nonsense place and we loved it. I'd definitely go back when I go back to London!",
