To start, of course, I have to order ceviche since this is a Peruvian restaurant, and I am biased toward simple fish ceviche. I let the waiter talk me into ordering Corvina with truffles. It sounded like a great idea, but the taste said otherwise. The taste of truffle was too overwhelming and I couldn't taste the freshness of the fish, not to mention there were that many pieces for me to really taste it. My friend and I also shared a few other small dishes, including a crab salad, which was the only thing that was memorable. Chilean seabass is my favorite fish and I usually stop reading any further when I see it on the menu. The waiter raved about the Chilean Seabass lime rice, and I listened to him, yet again. Well, this time the result was a bit better. The dish was good, but certainly not 32 pound good. I thought the rice was on the raw side. I have to say I have had much better Peruvian food for much less.",

We arrived prior to opening 5:40pm on a Sunday. We had a couple of cocktails (my Manhattan sucked, high alcohol-low flavor; don't trust that the bartender knows what he is doing) and sat down shortly after 6pm. They presented the menus, including the \u00a380 per person tasting menu- which we opted for. We were having such a great time (as old friends do) when, just prior to the dessert course, one of the Coya employees comes by to tell us of their policy on how much time one can take up for a table. A policy we were not told of previously. Mind you, this is while there are at least two two-person tables within eyesight that are completely empty, as well as several other larger tables that are completely empty. (It is a cavernous space with LOTS of tables). He interrupts us at least two more times but does not even bring the check (which, if they were in such a rush you would think they would bring by...). This guy finally comes around and wants us to move to the bar- and still has not brought the check! So, horrid service for overpriced food....that I have had far tastier versions of at less than half the cost of Coya at smaller Peruvian mom-and-pop restaurants whose level of service is an infinite improvement upon Coya. Don't bother with this place.",

It has a Zuma-esque feel to it but the Peruvian menu, designed by Head chef Sanjay, one is transported right to Peru. If thats not enough, the full Pisco bar will certainly do the trick.The staff is attentive and everything looks amazing, i have to say. I also know there is a small members club upstairs, but i had the chance to have a sneak peak and it is breath taking. I would highly recommend Coya for large parties as well as a romantic dinner. I was even more excited when I heard it is also open for lunch.Go, treat yourself. I know i will be going back there very soon",

I actually came here twice during my short stay as two different groups of friends just happened to pick the same spot, it was definitely a much more happening spot on Friday night than it was on a Sunday.The dishes were meant to be shared but the portions are pretty tiny. The ceviche was fantastic, we tried both the lubina and the atun chifa and kept wavering between which one was better! The sea bass was done perfectly, and the spicy beef fillet stood out from the rest of the dishes. The best part is definitely the dessert, I had the chance to sample pretty much the entire dessert menu and was not disappointed with any! I do recommend the chocolate cake and the popcorn one!Oh and one last note, their pisco sours are pretty divine!The only thing is, the price is PRETTY STEEP! As I already said, portions are tiny so come here with a corporate card if you want to be fed properly!",

It has an attached bar so small groups or romantic dates can lengthen the dinner by drinking some excellent Pisco Sours before or after. The dishes are small but yummy, especially the raw fish-based Tiraditos and Ceviches (although the white corn in my ceviche was not as \"poppy\" as it should have been). The meat dishes were also very good, I can recommend the chicken, lamb chops and the spicy beef. The pork chops were a little bland. It is definitely a great night out and it is nice to see a \"trendy\" restaurant that is not Asian.They have three sittings of two hours each, but we were not asked to leave and ended up staying for over three hours at the table. Maybe we got lucky. In any case, two hours is enough as the dishes come quickly.I do wonder if the whole \"sharing\" concept works as well for this food as it does for Asian food. Chop stick are great for picking food off various plates, but using forks to do so felt like lunch at school. \u00a0I thought it was awkward, I would prefer to have had at least the main course being a \"proper\" individual meal. It all felt a little too much like \"tapas\" for me and it reveals that the \"sharing\" concept is just an excuse for not having to organise the kitchen. But the jury is still out. I will certainly go back often.",

I confess that I drank quite a bit, so cannot remember a great deal about the meal... except that everything was delicious, the flavours of the ceviche were excellent... and little else. Oh dear - it just means I must make another trip. 4 stars as we were hearded from our table to a rather soulless bar after 2.5 hours.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, we experienced the worst service in London here. The food was not super amazing but nice. We reserved here on the recommendation of the staff at The Ritz where we are staying. First, the tables are way to close together. I get they want to maximize space/ revenue but the restaurant was not full and we were on top of the other table. Not even a foot in between. This would not have been that huge of a deal if the server (not our server) wasn't friends with the people at the table next to us. She kept sliding in between the tables and putting her bottom inches from my plate and uncomfortably close to my face. I swear she almost sat on our table at one point. Some might find this appetizing, I did not. The first time it was mildly annoying but I waited for her to leave and continued with my meal. After the fourth or fifth time my patience was gone and I asked her to move so I could get out. I did mention this to a man I assumed to be in management and the waitress as they happend to be standing together by me and they apologized in a defensive way saying it had already been addressed. Well if it was addressed how come no one apologized before I mentioned it. Also, really how can a waitress have so little common sense to begin with? Additionally, we ordered drinks with call liquor at a cost as described in the menu. We asked for this liquor to be prepared as a cocktail and we're subsequently charged to make the liquor into cocktail. On the bill it appeared to be rung up like it was an additional drink. They told us the charge was accurate because they made it a cocktail. I have not seen this anywhere else and there was not a notation in the menu that if you want the liquor mixed or as a cocktail it is extra. Is the glass extra because if so perhaps just take the bottle and pour it in my mouth. Really??!!! Honestly, it's not the money. We have a very short time here and just wanted a nice meal/experience and were more than happy to pay for it but spending 200 pounds and being disappointed is just that disappointing. The 23 pound automatic gratuity added was a joke. I presume we could have asked for it to be removed/ adjusted but we were so over being there we paid and left. We wanted a fun evening and we ended up feeling ripped off and disrespected.",

Dishes kept arriving before we were even half way through the previous serving. When we requested our server to slow down, he told us that he was helpless since he could not control the kitchen. We had to actually threaten to walk out before the food service slowed down to a manageable level. We had to repeatedly keep asking for fresh cutlery and serve our own wine since the staff was either inattentive or unavailable. On a positive note, the place is bursting with energy and our Sommelier recommended some great wine. What a pity that there is such lack of attention to detail at such a fancy venue...",

My favorite was the truffle one.- for Toradito we had Conchas (scallops) and Atun Nikkei (Yellow fin tuna). I really liked the tuna.- for antichuco we had the tiger prawn, which was unimpressive.- for salad and vegetable, we had corn salad, asparagus and broccoli. I loved the corn salad!- for mains, we had chicken and sea bass. I honestly think we should have just gone for more ceviches and toraditos since I thought they were just alright.- pisco sour was pretty strong and goodThe bad:- We had a reservation at 6pm and it was obvious they were trying to hurry us up throughout the meal so the next table can be seated. In fact, we were actually told that as the waiter hurried us to order. Then different waiters kept coming by and asking if we are done, even though there were still food on our plates!- they try to add hidden charges without asking. We had chips and guacamole while waiting for a friend and they ordered is two servings without asking. Then, if you don't ask them to stop, they will keep refilling your still/sparkling water which are \u00a35 per bottle. These are minor since it adds up to only a few pounds per person, but I never like it when restaurants do this.",

    "text": "Coya is an outstanding place for a dinner date. I came here with my boyfriend for a special occasion and everything was perfect! The restaurant was chic and lively, with a DJ playing throughout the night at the bar and small dance area towards the front of the restaurant.We started with some Chilean white wine, which was fruity and crisp and was going to pair well with a seafood-heavy menu. The Coya menu featured Peruvian small plates consisting of ceviche, sashimi and grilled items. There are three things that were a must: the Atun Chifa ceviche, Hiramasa sashimi and the Arroz Nikkei iron pot. The Atun Chifa is a yellow fin tuna ceviche prepared in a citrusy dressing with a touch of soy and sesame and some prawn crackers, served atop a bed of shaved ice. This dish was really creative, flavorful and refreshing! I definitely recommend this for an appetizer.The Hiramasa sashimi is a great follow up to the appetizer. This dish featured king fish sashimi served with a truffle and mushroom dressing. It was delicate yet indulgent. I couldn't get enough of the dressing.The Arroz Nikkei is basically a sea bass risotto served in a hot stone pot. I'm not a fan of risotto but this was recommended by a friend and it exceeded my expectations. I've had my fair share of overcooked and dry sea bass but this one was succulent and cooked to perfection. The risotto was creamy but not mushy. All the flavors were really well balanced in this dish and the squeeze of lime helped to enhance all the flavors. I would come again for any of these three dishes.Additionally, my boyfriend and I also shared some wings, crab tacos and a chocolate dessert. The crab tacos were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside but the wings were nothing mind blowing. The waiter gave us a bowl of lemon water to wash our fingers in afterwards, which was a plus to the service here. The rich chocolate molten cake was really yummy paired with a scoop of tangy passion fruit ice cream. Overall, dinner at Coya was a refreshing and very enjoyable experience! Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and the food and wine were great! I've never experienced Peruvian cuisine prior to this and the food here makes me want to visit Peru. P.S. There's also a free coat check at the front, which is great when you don't want to carry around your winter coat especially if you're planning to hit the dance area.",

The fried calamari is brilliant and quite different to the ones you usually get it. The ceviche trio was awesome and refreshing. With food so good, we got greedy and over ordered the prawn tempura.. it was so light and great. For the mains, we had the spicy beef fillet and the tiger prawn. The spicy beef is the best piece of meat I have had till now. It was out of the world. The service is what blew my mind. The staff are brilliant, they are always there to attend to you yet not hanging around you. Very unpretentious place that serves great food and has fab staff. Totally totally recommend this to anyone .. must try this place",

    "text": "I came here with a large group of friends to try their sunday brunch menu. I don't think any of us felt particularly welcome, but although the service felt a bit off, the yummy food means they still deserve 4 stars.For the brunch menu, they'll bring starters and dishes to share, so you just need to choose a main dish...then more sharing deserts are presented last. Everything we tried was gorgeous. I loved the cerviche the edamame, the meaty skewers and the calamari. I shared mains with my friend so got to try the roast lamb and the sea bream...both of them were delicious. Other good points:- You can have bottomless champagne for \u00a320. They were very clear that they would not serve the bubbles until we had food...and that when we received deserts, that would be our last top-up. All the rules made it sound like they were going to be stingy with the bubbles...but they were pretty good at keeping our glasses full! - For some reason, just after we finished out mains, there was a magician who came around to show us some card tricks!! Strange things:- The waiters seems just a bit cold and odd. - The menu is a little bizarre. You just have to choose a main dish...and they have options for \u00a336 or \u00a346. And then they have other options for +\u00a310 (so I'm not sure why they don't list them in the \u00a346 menu!?) It is all a bit confusing.",

The portions are small and flavours not authentic at all, \u00a0the only thing that filled me up, barely \u00a0was the dessert, and I don't even \u00a0like dessert. After \u00a0spending 100 pounds pp with just two drinks each, am struggling to say anything positive. The service was pleasant, saving grace, and the decor and ambience is good. \u00a0The place was chosen by a friend who doesn't live here, would never have chosen it myself.",

    "text": "Up and coming Peruvian restaurant. Posh and chic.What sets apart is the quality of food at Coya.Strategically positioned on the edge of Piccadily (118), there is a special function room at the parlor level. The bar and restaurant is one level below ground floor. Cloak room is also situated on the lower level.I didn't hangout at the bar but it looks well stocked The food is really nice. Out of the 7-8 things we have ordered and shared, only one was not at par. Ceviches were good - the only complaint is the size of the plate.We ordered sea bass which was fantastic. Beef on a skewer was equally mouth watering. \u00a0Must try.Our service, bar few small delays, was pretty good.A must visit",

Having never before dined on Peruvian food and needing some guidance with the menu, our server could not have been more informative and accommodating. He was right on target for the amount of food to order (he even said our 5 dishes shared, should be sufficient and to not over-order!) and the selection was perfectly balanced and matched to our taste. We enjoyed every delicious bite of Yellowfin Tuna Ceviches, Yellowtail Tiraditos, Josper Octopus, Pork Back Ribs and a side of broccoli. Can't rave enough about Coya! Not to be missed when in London.",

Our waiter was a bit eccentric yet extremely enthusiastic about the menu.The Ron Jeremias was one of the best cocktails I've had--sweet and tangy with a generous slice of passionfruit on top.From worst to best raw dishes: lubina cl\u00e1sico, at\u00fan chifa, pez lim\u00f3n. That last one (yellowtail tiradito) was a definite highlight.From worst to best warm dishes: arroz nikkei, broccoli, spicy beef, octopus.For dessert, the chocolate fundido and caramel con chocolate were very solid and more than satisfied our sweet tooth.Overall, everything ranged from decent to fantastic.

    "text": "My husband and I were on completely different pages (not unusual) after dining at Coya last month. Whereas I'd give Coya 3 stars, he'd give it a 4.5. Ultimately (and obviously) I decided to go with 4 stars.Ambiance: We went for dinner and the place filled up around 7pm, right when we arrived. Coya is dark and sleek and a probably not a place for a child (who was with us, as she most always is).Service: Good. The waitress was friendly. The one thing I didn't like was her recommendation to order 2 appetizers, 1 entr\u00e9e, and one dessert per person. If we'd followed her suggestion we'd have had WAY too much food.Food: There were hits and some misses.-- Pollo Tacos - These are TINY. I mean each is probably 2 bites. I didn't try these but my daughter loved them so much she ordered another. I cringed since they were very overpriced.-- Papa Seca - This was interesting. I couldn't taste the egg and instead just tasted potatoes. I don't think this was a hit for anyone at the table.-- Lobster - This came over rice and was very good. A bit chewy but we all still enjoyed this dish.-- Lubina Chilena - The seabass in this dish was delicious! Perfectly cooked.-- Patatas Bravas - Terrible. Definitely don't recommend this greasy side.-- Asparagus - Nothing special and I don't want to think about how much we paid for 6 stalks of asparagus.Pricing: Most tapas places lean towards the expensive side and Coya is no exception.Overall: Not sure I'd return here but apparently my husband wants to back. I'll let you guess who'll win that battle. :)",
