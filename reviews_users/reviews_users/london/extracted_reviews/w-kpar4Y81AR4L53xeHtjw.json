    "text": "Newly opened in August 2013, Pizza Pilgrims Pizzeria is located on Dean Street in the heart of Soho. While the joice of location, opposite Pizza Express and just a few doors down from Soho Joe, is brave, Pizza Pilgrims already built up some fans with their pizza van, and if I have to choose between Pizza Express and Pizza Pilgrims, I do not have to think too long about where to go. When I got there, the downstairs area was busy, so I was offered a place upstairs. I reckon the atmosphere downstairs is a bit different, but it's fine upstairs, too. I was handed a menu immediately but after I was stupid enough to pass it over to my neighbours who asked me for it, I was overlooked when it came to ordering. Once this issue was fixed, the service was very friendly and attentive.I opted for the pizza Napoli Salami and also ordered a white wine. I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of their white wine on tap. It tastes ok, but that is about it for me. Whereas the pizza is as delicious as you expect if you ever bought a pizza from their van. Due to the lack of a pepper mill on my table, I could not spice it up a little bit, but really, it did not need spicing up anyway. It tasted great as it was. The pizza was not huge, but definitely big enough for me.After I finished my pizza, I looked through the desserts. Ice cream from Gelupo is undeniably a tempting option, but if you could have a Nutella pizza ring, why would you choose anything else?! If you ever went camping when you were young, you probably know campfire bread or stick bread or whatever you called it back it the days. The nutella ring tastes exactly like that, it is a simple culinary delight.Despite the abundance of Italian restaurants in the area, Pizza Pilgrims Pizzeria is a great addition and a place you should check out if you like a good pizza, because they do one of the best pizzas in London!",

    "text": "I used to think I knew the best place to go for pizza in London, but then I came to pizza pilgrims and my world was turned upside down! Fantastic. I love that it is opposite a pizza express. Why would anyone go to an overpacked average chain when this place exists next door??Pleasantly surprised to find many more tables downstairs in addition to the street level stools, we were welcomed in for lunch just before the crowds arrived. The pizza was superb, with quality ingredients, nice thin base and cooked for just the right amount of time (I.e not too long!). We had the calzone and a margherita, both excellent. You are looking at between \u00a37 and \u00a311 for a pizza, so pretty good for Soho and the quality. If you like pizza, this place is a must!Can't wait to return!",

The restaurant itself is usually overcrowded, with terrible acoustics in the basement, so you can barely hear what your dinner company is saying. I do have to say that the staff was quite friendly, which is always appreciated! I'm never one to complain about much, but the hubbub surrounding Pizza Pilgrims left me disappointed when I went and experienced it myself! Feels like one of those places that you're supposed to say you like just because everyone else says they like it (though no one actually likes it themselves). Do I recommend this place? Meh.

Small, cozy, with the pizza guy working in front of people, and a big wooden oven.Small selection of pizzas (I think 6), a couple of desserts and beer. That's it, that's what I want, that's what I need from a pizza place!so let's go strarght to the main topic: the pizza!Now, first time I try a pizza spot equal margherita with bufala, BUT not here. Unfortunately I saw 'nduja, and whenever I see that magic word my brain starts to do backflips (yes, inside the cranium). So here we go, margherita with 'nduja & bufala!Now, the pizza is neapolitan style: that means soft, high, not very large, in one word: delicious. That's the only adjective. Tomato, mozzarella, perfect, just perfect, the cheese is not that melted (which is good, I don't want a layer of cheese like a cover, it's mozzarella not a quilt!). The 'nduja is probably the worst part of this dish, not because it's bad but it's a bit under-spicy (is it even a word? well you understood what I meant).. I kind of understand that, it must be good for everybody and therefore must not bee too spicy, but still it's 'nduja, not a sweet salami!The kitchen was closed before we could order the nutella ring, therefore... the 5 stars are delayed for the next trial!",

My only suggestion is that they use actual wine glasses- it would make the experience better than using water cups. I ordered the Artichoke and ricotta pizza and it was very flavorsome. My husband ordered the nduja and really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back! Fair prices for quality pizza.",

The smell of fresh pizza with a hint of basil in the air, is one to get your tummy rumbling, but do beware not to wonder around smelling with your eyes closed as downstairs in very cramped regardless of the foosball table..The nduja - spicy sausage pizza, is true to the word spicy, however if you are expecting solid pieces of meat, ask the waiter about the pizza ingredients. However, more importantly, how do you like your pizza? A must for me is a crispy base, which this lacked entirely. The sauce adds to the messy, doughy and soggy texture. The pizzas at their pop up had the same flavour but with a crispy base and slight crunch to compliment the perfect sauce and toppings.Having a litre of prosecco to wash this down with helped, but if you are prosecco-less, and more fussy than a drunken soho straggler, ask for a crispier base at the least.",

    "text": "More at: apinchofsaltandsugar.wor\u2026Neapolitan pizza has been all the rage in the foodie world lately. \u00a0Ever since watching 'Eat, Pray, Love' a few years back seeing Julia Roberts devour hers at the famed Italian establishment L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, Neapolitan pizza has been one of my favourite / special meals to have - which is also why I don't have it very often since it makes each occasion that much more special.Prior to creating this blog, I had been to Franca Manca in Brixton for their famous sourdough Neapolitan styled pizzas. \u00a0Still fondly remembering the experience, I turned to Pizza Pilgrims in Soho - an establishment which started out as a humble street food van turning into a full restaurant affair from their street success. \u00a0Sandwiched in between two other pizzerias, Pizza Express and Soho Joe, Dean street surely has become a pizza battleground for the three restaurants.We ordered two pizzas- pizza Bufala and Aubergine ParmigianaThe eggplant pizza was their featured item; and it was a disappointing pizza.. scarcely dotted with eggplant (ok fine, I will call it aubergine since we are in Europe) which made this topping quite pointless as you could barely taste the 'aubergine' as it was overpowered by the stronger flavours of cheese and tomato.Unfortunately, the mozzarella pizza was not cooked as well as the eggplant as demonstrated from the extent of charring or 'leoparding' seen on the base.The mozzarella also wasn't bubbling hot, and had lost is melting consistency (it was rather gummy by the time I started eating it) suggesting perhaps the pizza was left on the counter for a bit too long after being removed from the oven.There's been longstanding debate whether Neopolitan pizza should or should not be soupy. It appears Pizza Pilgrims have adopted the soupy philosophy in the centre, But, think I prefer a much more crisper base similar to what I had at Franca Manca.Overall, I was a bit disappointed in Pizza Pilgrims. \u00a0Perhaps it has been a victim of its own success; the pizzas not achieving consistency due to the volume of demands. There's Soho Joe next door also known for pretty good Neapolitan pizzas too... maybe one to put on my wishlist",

Bloody Mary-nara is so special, so spicy so amazing for a hangover, Nduja is delicious and a bit spicey too, the pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil is heaven on earth and all the others are also so worth a try.Friendly people working here and a great atmosphere if you sit downstairs.Unfortunately it was full when I last came here and me and my friend were sitting upstairs which is not as comfy but what don't you do for a good pizza? Love this place!",

The menu is fairly short, pizza topping combinations are simple and pizzas aren't overcrowded with too many flavors. I ordered a vegetarian pizza with aubergines, thinly sliced garlic, fresh basil, fresh milky mozzarella (usually cheese lefts me with a heavy feeling in my stomach, but this one was light) and yummy tomato sauce. The dough was baked to perfection and the rim was very soft but chewy - the best dough I ever tasted and I make a pretty good pizza myself. The ingredients complimented itself beautifully and I cannot wait to come back for more!The story of Pizza Pilgrims is a fairly interesting one too - 2 brothers who left their boring jobs, went to Italy and learned how to make pizza. I am always glad to support such artisans.",

This satisfy my food buddy taste buds with the pizza ring and my taste buds with ice cream. The warm pizza ring filled with melted Nutella tasted good with the cold ice cream. An excellent optional combination.The pizza at Pizza Pilgrims serves soft pizza base. Its probably not for those that like there pizza with a crispy base.

The menu has a lot of great options, ranging from plain margaritas to more creatively topped pizzas I can't begin to pronounce. They have toppings for both veggies and meat lovers, and seemed happy to make any amendments (within reason) to the toppings for you - I'm no fan of goats cheese and they made sure not to add it for me. \u00a0The pizzas are great value for money, come out of the oven piping hot with cheese so melted it turns into string when you tug the slices away. \u00a0 The only thing that I felt did let it down was how sloppy it was - I'm a big 'eat pizza with your hands' kind of girl, preferring to cut it into slices, but I had to fold the slice in half to be able to eat it without all the topping sliding off onto the plate.",

I mean, it's not every place that you walk into the door and the waitstaff are having a spontaneous \"Seasons of Love\" sing-a-long because the song happened to get played over their sound system. I was tempted to join in. I kinda did sing it at my seat a bit, but not as loudly or awesomely as they did. Although the server did comment that I was singing along too. I mean how could you not?However, I knew that I would need to try the food before I could actually make that final decision. I ordered the special pizza (a selection of two italian meats, cheese and basil on a tomato base) and a side salad (because eating a healthy salad cancels out the pizza, right?) I also had one of the Italian beers that was on special for the month.I sat upstairs by the window because I was on my own, so I got to see everyone walking by. The venue does look small, but there is more seating downstairs. The beer was really good. Whoever chooses the beer here has a great palate. My salad arrived and it looked fantastic. A nice mix of greens, capers and cheese. It also tasted fantastic. Wow. Probably one of the best salads I've had at a restaurant. Someone put a lot of thought into it. The pizza was tasty as well. A sparse amount of toppings, but just enough. And the dough is really spongy and delicious. I really can't fault it.I totally wanted to try the Nutella ring, but i was on my own, so I couldn't order a whole one for myself. I mean my salad wouldn't cancel out that as well. And also I was really full. But I'm sure I'll be back to give it a try. It put me in a good mood for the rest of the night. I had \"Seasons of Love\" running through my head when I ran a few more errands before seeing the show I was planning on watching that night. Then I put the Rent soundtrack on when I got home and was getting ready for bed. All thanks to Pizza Pilgrims. Delicious, Delicious Pizza Pilgrims.",

I've found myself settling on Papa John's (and worse!) and had almost convinced myself it was close to the real deal (see: Firezza review). But alas, one trip home and I was launched back into reality and scolding my tastebuds for ever settling.And then there was Pizza Pilgrims - when it started as a food truck, I had my first bite and that desire to write off carbs for the summer was abandoned. \u00a0Now, perfectly located on Dean Street (and literally a hop away from Soho Theatre if you're looking for some basement comedy!), this is always one of my first choices for a meet up with friends if we're all central.Numerous trips to Naples and NYC later, I find that I can't wait to get back to London for a pie to myself. \u00a0The staple menu items are always a delight, but you can never go wrong with the featured pie. \u00a0As a lover of all tomato based pizzas, I just recently decided to take the plunge and have the mushroom and truffle instead...and may now be a convert. That being said, the staff is always super accommodating and during that particular switch, they offered to bring me a glass of red sauce on the side for dipping (just in case! - I'm happy to report that the sauce alone is fresh and delicious!). \u00a0Grab an aperol spritz to accompany your pizza and if you're feeling sassy try some of their new limencello to finish. \u00a0Though they don't take reservations, I have never had too long a wait for a table - and as mentioned earlier this is the perfect place to stop before an evening comedy show!",

I spent nearly 2 years living in Italy and whilst no English pizza can really compare - Pizza Pilgrim is my top London place for delicious fresh tasting pizza with a thin enough but doughy enough base. I've had so many different types of pizza here - I love that they have a guest pizza so I can always have something different - I've yet to ever try dessert here because I'm always so full by the end of it!Prices are really affordable and it's decor downstairs is cute and clean. In the summer they even have outdoor seating - really a gem in the heart of soho.",

I was there a couple of weeks ago and absolutely loved it - you definitely need to try it out here if you're wanting non traditional but ridiculously tasty pizza. Lovely staff, nice cosy Italian cafe vibe if you're seated downstairs and a generally good time - definitely recommend!",

    "text": "4.5 stars.Yes yes yes. Best Neapolitan pizza in London I've had so far. Good Neapolitan pizza is oddly difficult to find in the city. There are a bunch of places that offer it, but it's not up to snuff. This place is the real deal.Saturday afternoon for a party of 2, there wasn't much wait. Maybe 5-10 minutes. The place is super casual and decorated like a no frills pizza joint. But the quality of the food is fantastic.Marinara - Tomato, oregano, fresh garlic, basilMargherita - Tomato, fior di latte, parmesan, basilFirst rule of authentic Neapolitan pizza places is that they will offer a Marinara. The marinara and the margherita are the two classic Neapolitan pizzas. So many places don't have a marinara. Those are the places you should be more sceptical of (although of course some do turn out to be quite good). The marinara and margherita are both quite plain and simple pizzas, but the test of the quality of a pizza shop is in these two. The marinara in particular really allows you to taste the dough and the tomato sauce, the two most important aspects of a quality pizza. Both were hits here. The dough was right in taste and texture, the tomato sauce was a great balance of tart and sweet - almost neutral is the key. The fresh garlic, basil, and oregano were great additions. In the margherita, the fior di latte was great quality. Not rubbery in texture at all like so many other pizza places and definitely fresh.The price is amazing as well and the portion size is satisfying. I will absolutely be back.",

However, since having Franco manca pizza and Homeslice I would choose those over Pizza Pilgrim. I prefer the dough and the toppings are a little more generous I think. Also the second time we went we received poor service meaning one of our group didn't get his pizza until we had all finished ours, and it was plonked on the table without a word. Rude! But they didn't charge us for that pizza in the end which was better than nothing!",

There were ten pizzas on the menu including a guest pizza, which changes regularly. None of the pizzas have particularly complex toppings - the Salsiccia e Friarielli, bianca base, fresh fennel sausage, wild brocolli, fior di latte, parmesan, basil & olive oil (\u00a311) is probably as busy as it gets. Less is more at Pizza Pilgrims and the quality of simple ingredients is the key to their offering. Sides include one of my favourite salads, Panzanella (\u00a35) and Buffalo mozzarella with oven roasted pepperonata (\u00a36).We decided to keep it simple with a Margherita (\u00a38) for Antonia and the Nduja (\u00a39), which was a Margherita with topped with Nduja sausage. We also ordered a Berwick Street Market Salad (\u00a33) on the side. Much to our delight Pizza Pilgrims have Birra Moretti on draught for \u00a34.50 per 400ml glass, which took us straight back to our week in Tuscany last year.",

The crust was perfect, all puffed up around the edges, the perfect level of chewy, doughy, and crunchy. And I really liked the way they shredded the salami so that you got some in every bite. Sometimes you just get four big rounds of salami and I feel like I have to really consider how I eat each slice (I know this is weird, don't think about eating the pizza, just eat it).Sitting outside on a bench was a perfectly acceptable option for us, but the wait for a table was only around 15 minutes so it's definitely not necessary if you're not in a hurry.",

She claims she's been in the industry for years and is used to that request for GF pizza. Surprising she's been in the service industry for so long being such a rude, American hating, piece of crap.

    "text": "NYC better watch its back. The Pizza Pilgrims could cross the pond and lay serious waste to any pizza joint it comes across there. First off, I guess word hasn't gotten out too much about how good this place is, or London is just not as into pizza as it should be since I visited twice and didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table. A pie this good stateside would have a line half-a-mile long out the front door. The dough is divine, the sauce is savory and the ingredients are incredible. (See what I did there?) I ordered the Salami, which was basically a Margherita Pizza with thinly sliced salami and it was such a convincing piece of pizza artistry that on my second visit (THE NEXT DAY!!!) I had it again. Not a single bite was spared on either pilgrimage. The pizzas came out of the oven minutes after ordering them and for incredibly reasonable prices given how damn tasty they are. The ambiance was chill/hispter and I loved it. There's pretty much nothing I would change about this place if given the chance. One the second visit I even sprung for the much fabled nutella roll-thing-a-ma-bob. It was as good as they say it is, though they give you enough to split with 4-5 people so there was no way me and the wife could finish that thing.",

    "text": "Great pizza, but skip the dessert!I came here as a group of 10 for a co-workers birthday. We were seated downstairs in a separate room off the main restaurant. The restaurant sounded quite loud so it was nice to be a little more secluded away from the main dining area.I ordered the 'aubergine parmigiana'. The dough was soft and squidgy, whilst still being thin-crust. I really enjoyed the fluffy consistency of it- I preferred it to the super thin and crispy base that you often find at London pizza restaurants. The toppings were also really tasty and flavourful. The one thing I might criticize is that the pizza was a little oily in the middle. The servers brought us chilli oil and chilli flakes to accompany the pizza.To finish, I had the espresso with nutella, which was quite tasty.. but then again anything with nutella is gonna be good.. right?! Other's in the group had the affogato. The ice-cream came in a tub making it a little difficult for them to pour the espresso on top! I tried some of the nutella and salted ricotta pizza ring. I have to say I was a bit disappointed- there was no where near enough filling and where the nutella had been baked it had become a bit dry. Boo.Overall we had a really enjoyable meal, with very attentive service. It was also very affordable for Soho, at about \u00a318 per head for dinner, drinks and dessert. Our limit on the table was 2 hours, but as the service was so good, we finished with time to spare. I will definitely be back- but just for the pizza!Oh and this place was packed on a weekday evening! So be prepared to wait. Alternatively, if you are a group of 8 or more like we were, you can pre-book the separate room downstairs!",

Because of this I dropped a star. \u00a0Good point is location...in Soho and \u00a0not far from where a lot is going on especially at night time. \u00a0Overall I think a good place for something nice and quick if you are on a night out...but definitely not for a romantic evening.",

A real good smokiness to the pizza and ever so slightly charred. The topping are just class, the tomatoes rich and bursting with flavour, not sweet, perfectly seasoned, so simple and fresh and it all tastes so darn good!!! \u00a0The mozzarella was also really delicious and fresh and the pizza wasn't completely smothered in the stuff, happy days :)Service, meh, not the best if I'm honest. I was waiting around 15-20 minutes for my pizza, which, given how busy the place was, was fine by me. However, I didn't get the beer I ordered until AFTER my pizza arrived, I was gasping for a drink by that point, so minus a wee half brownie point there.The other half brownie point disappears for again, pretty crappy service, this time for mega slow payment of the bill. It took well over 10mins to pay for one pizza and a beer (and I was sitting next to the till). Countless staff walked past and chose to ignore my money which I had placed invitingly at the end of the table. Once my change did come back I noticed they had somehow paid the wrong bill, doh! Not sure if this is normal, but clearly these guys were having a bit of a 'mare that night.Not to worry, I certainly didn't go for the fine silver service experience. What I was hoping for was a top notch, authentic pizza, and on that front they totally delivered.",

    "text": "I stumbled across Pizza Pilgrims late one Wednesday night, fresh from a few hours of rehearsals. I was hungry and tired, with a keen craving for a friendly place where I could have some real, fresh pizza. I had passed by Pizza Express (and given it the side eye- I really think their pizza is overrated), and had already checked out the scene at Homeslice (good pizza - but it was crowded and busy). I was on my way to my third option when I passed by this friendly place.Honestly, I think what made me turn around and walk back was... the smell. The herbal aroma of oregano and basil and the warm, comforting smell of fresh pizza dough baking in the oven - this was the smell I had been looking for. The restaurant had a very friendly air, quiet enough even with a few tables full, nicely spacious (with more seating downstairs) with classic pizzeria checkered tablecloths and figurines of New York icons on the wall, holding slices. It was late - around 10 or so, a half hour before closing - but the service was incredibly friendly and had me seated at the front counter in no time.  I went with a simple Margherita with added fennel sausage (couldn't resist), and a glass of their house white wine. The wine was surprisingly nice - aromatic and fruity but still nicely dry - and the pizza was delicious. Thick, chewy crust, big chunks of mozzarella, and dots of savory sausage. I added some chili flakes and then dug in. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't the world's best pizza!! I will agree it was pretty soggy/thin in the middle of the pie, but honestly it didn't bother me. The flavors were good, the ambience was friendly, and the service very agreeable. All in all, it was exactly what I had been craving. And I had the leftovers for breakfast this morning!",

We ordered two - a Filetti and a traditional Margherita (personally preferred the Marg hence the lack of photo as I tucked straight into it) and the crusts were probably one of the top five best I've ever had in my life. Along with the great chewy, soft crust the pizza itself had nice tangy tomato sauce, soggy center, milky mozzarella - all the qualities one would come to expect in a great Naples style pizza. No slices so be prepared to use your fork/knife skills (fellow Americans, I'm talking to you) which is how Neapolitan styled pizzas should be eaten anyways. I'm seeing a lot of comparison to this and NY style pizza. How is there even a comparison? It's apples and oranges, folks.",

I had the Salsicca e Friarelli pizza - topped with fennel sausage, chilli, wild broccoli, parmesan and olive oil. AND IT WAS DELICIOUS. Plenty of topping, the sausage and broccoli worked really well together.The pizza dough is also something pretty special - normally, I'm not big on crusts, preferring to eat as much topping as possible before I'm full. But I absolutely scoffed the crusts on these without a second thought.The selection of craft beers and lager is small yet well-thought out - I went for a can of the Birra Moretti, which was light, easy to drink and worked really well with the pizza. If you're feeling a bit more fancy, there's also a small range of cocktails to choose from - I loved the sound of Lola's Cherry Cola - Disaronno, Prosecco and Chinotto topped with a glac\u00e9 cherry. And for \u00a36, it's a relatively inexpensive Soho restaurant cocktail too.We grabbed a bowl of mixed olives for sharing - a good sized portion to whet our appetites before the dough-y goodness that was about to hit our table. I also loved the sound of the Buffalo mozzarella with smoked tomatoes, black pepper and rocket.With none of the regular pizzas on the menu going over a tenner, and starting at just \u00a35.50 for a Marinara, Pizza Pilgrims definitely offers an affordable pizza experience if you're in penny-pinching-pre-payday mode. In fact, there's probably enough in my change box to afford one RIGHT now. Seeya in a bit, guys.",

Situated towards the Oxford Street end of Dean Street, this particular branch has the air of a traditional, old school, Italian restaurant. The main kitchen with the wood fired oven is at the top and the restaurant area and bar downstairs. The walls are adorned with famous movie posters but in Italian, not in English. We got there quite early and were given our pick of tables. I ordered the Salsiccia E Friarielli, which is a white pizza with fresh fennel sausage, chilli, wild broccoli, parmesan, basil and olive oil, whilst my companion ordered the Ndjua which is a Margherita with ndjua, a spicy Calabrian pork sausage. We decided to split the pizzas in half which was such a good idea as BOTH pizzas were delicious. The dough was soft, the base was thin, there was a sufficient amount of cheese on both pizzas and they were both flavoured exquisitely! LOVED it!For dessert we ordered the Nutella & salted ricotta pizza ring to share. It was yummy but I was soooooo full that I don't think I appreciated it as much as I should have! The drink I ordered was pretty tasty too - Lola's Cherry Cola - Disaronno, Prosecco, Chinotto and a glace cherry! Extremely delicious and totally moreish!The reason why this place gets 4 stars is because the toilets were a bit grim and the service was a bit slow. We were waiting for nearly half an hour for the waiter to clean our plates away. Admittedly, I had crusts on mine but I hadn't touched them for a while. He even came to our table, replenished our tap water and did not touch our plates. Some people might think I am being picky so I apologise and definitely do not let that put you off!",

Pizzas are amazing, with fresh and great products, perfectly cooked, tasty, simple. This is quite the best pizza in London in my opinion ! The service is pretty nice too, smiling, efficient and generous with explanations :-) It really tastes like Italy ! The atmosphere is also pretty nice, the choice of music was great (some oldies but it was perfect :)). We had a great time and ended the meals with some desserts : I tried the vanilla ice cream with sea salt and olive oil. It was interesting but to be honest, not my favourite dessert :p My friends chose the nutella and ricotta pizza ring (following the waitress'advice) and this one was really convincing :-) We definitely love this place and we'll be back.",

    "text": "Honestly...Your pizza is supposed to be a soft crust yes, understood. but when the middle is cut into and it's undercooked, and the cheese is mostly water because the mozzarella was not tended to properly and it leaks a milky floury white...you have problems that need sorting. If your competitor/doppelganger Franco Manca is using the same model, it would be something to be of concern when you're messing about in this way.",

Dough good sauce good cheese good sausage good! Yum! I hear they do takeaway so will pick this over dominoes any day!",

The crust is really crispy and tasty and not too doughy unlike other places I've been. They also have a good selection of wines and local beers like Brixton (one of my favourites). Haven't had the chance to try the desserts but they looked really good and well presented.You can have a really nice lunch or dinner for around \u00a310 or \u00a312 which is way cheaper than any other place I've been. The staff is quite friendly and the atmosphere is great. The decoration is really unique and they even have a computer with game emulators shaped like the old 80s-90s arcade coin machines!",
