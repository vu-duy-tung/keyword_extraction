I had already eaten, so I ordered their ceviche/tiraditos sampler with the squid ceviche and the king scallop and tuna tiraditos. Each of these was literally one bite. The king scallop was not bad, but I definitely thought the squid and tuna dishes were lacking in flavor. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's steak and it was just okay. Seems like something that could easily be made at home.",

We arrived a few minutes early, so we grabbed a drink at the downstairs bar. I asked for a dirty martini, they made it straight up, once notified they replaced it instantly. On to the meal.. This had to have been the best steak I have ever had.. EVER. Our waitress was attentive, walked us through all the different cuts, sides, sauces, wines. If you are in London, looking to have a great dinner in a trendy restaurant... Gaucho is for you",

The door staff greeted us as soon as we walked in and wished us a great meal. \u00a0The welcome desk was also friendly offering to take our coat and bags into the cloak room. \u00a0It was a great way to start the evening. \u00a0We already had heard of this wonderful restaurant from our flat mate and we were excited to try it. We looked at the wine list and they were out of the Sauvignon Blanc that we wanted and the waiter kindly suggested another wine on the same level. \u00a0It was a mixture of 90% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Riesling. \u00a0I was very impressed by his recommendation that had a very smooth finish. We also ordered a empanada which was fantastic. \u00a0I definitely suggest these as a starter. \u00a0 I then ordered the 300g sirloin with a side of potato puree. \u00a0It was to die for. \u00a0I definitely recommend making sure you get a side as all the steaks are a la cart. \u00a0The server was very attentive for the amount of people that he had in his section. \u00a0He even brought out cuts of the meat to show to us so we could get an idea of what we were ordering. He was also very easy on the eyes which was of course a plus. \u00a0This place is a little pricey (about 16.95-22.92 pounds for a 8 ounce steak) but you definitely will not be disappointed. \u00a0This place makes for a great date night or a night out with the girls.",

OK, they do have some other items on the menu, but please, if you don't want steak go somewhere else. I love this place and can't recommend it highly enough. Hhmm, getting hungry now.",

Meat is cooked in the open in the center of the room to your desired bloodyness and if not, they are more than willing to swap it for a new piece of meat (and new sides, too, if you ordered any). I tried the churrasco cut (spiral cut and marinated with herbs and olive oil) because I like thinner cuts and that was quite good although the smallest for that cut-300g-is way too much for me. Had plenty of my bf's filet and that was done very well, too. Be sure to try the cheesey bread in your bread basket. It's chewy and flavorful. Much like the Korean mochi bread. My only beef (harhar) with this place is that it was too dark. Straining to read the menu and straining to see the real color of my food never goes well in my book. Oh, and they should include SOME sides at least. I feel like everything extra in the UK costs extra. :(",

But look at that wine list! Look at those rib eyes! Enjoyed a long wine matching evening here recently, which meant a thorough run through all the various cuts of steak. That's why I can now tell you that fillet is lovely and tender but packs no flavour, unlike rump, sirloin and, best of all, rib-eye. Wibble, drool, ad lib to fade Decent chips too, and the humitas - mashed corn and spices - is pretty darn fine too.

Such a nice change from the standard steak.Warning: My husband and I came here last year as well and both times we've had to wait about 15-20 minutes before being seated at our table. Then once you get to your table it takes a while for your server to greet you and by the time you get your food its been a good 45-60 minutes. So don't come here starving.This restaurant is very trendy with dim lighting and cow skins all over the walls and chairs. I ordered the Picada as a starter for the entire table.It was a mix of spanish cured meats (Serrano ham, prosciutto type stuff), westcome cheddar (yum), marinated artichoke hearts olives and peppers. It comes out quick for those who didn't listen to my warning (i.e. me) and you are starting to get dizzy because you're so hungry. For my main course I had the Churrasco cut of the Chorizo (sirloin). It's marinated for at least 24 hours in a Chimichuri sauce. It was very satisfying. They had a special dessert that wasn't on the menu. I got that of course. The bottom layer is a sweet biscuit (cookie), topped with slices of bananas, layered with caramel, then the very top is a cheesecake-like cream. So far I haven't had a bad dessert experience in London yet. The English do it right.anitaeat.com",

The food, as at all of the Gauchos, is first class with a fabulous selection of Argentinian steaks with a variety of cuts and the opportunity to see the cuts and have them explained along with how they are best cooked before diving in to the eating. Outside of the steaks are a great selection of sides with the mushrooms being my personal favourite though all of them are great and go very well alongside the main event of the meat. There is a decent wine list as well along with a wide variety of other drinks to satisfy the majority of diners. The wine varies from reasonable to fairly mind crushingly expensive so something for everyone really. The atmosphere is great - its all cow hide seats in a little darkened cellar style setting, and it really is the perfect place or a long lunch that just keeps on goingI seem to remember one time we were still there when the evening sitting was coming in Cheap it is not - but I'd say it's good value as it's not exorbitant.

Some bad points after all my visits to the place, is that waiters or anyone who's serving has no idea about wines really and they do sell wines there! Very keen to sell but in an obvious way. They are basically working on a shop with no real intention to inform you about their products. Something really nasty is the fact that 3 times I have seen staff cleaning around you EVEN UNDER THE SEAT YOU SIT (!) with a VERY noisy broom Unacceptable-unbelievable. Except the disturbance of the atmosphere its not really hygienic doing that while people dining!

    "text": "Not headline worthyWe had reservations for another Restaurant in the area, but due to a water main bursting on Regent Street we had to scramble to get somewhere else close on a Saturday night - Concierge at the Hotel recommended here, and I have a friend who used to work for them - so we went for it.Firstly, not the easiest Restaurant to find and its up a bit of a dodgy alley full of private taxis and bouncers. Once inside we felt a little safer. Ignoring the large group of Italians who were kicking off at the reception desk we spoke to a member of staff who found our reservation and escorted us up to our table. The place was busy, very busy and there a was a good hustle and bustle about the place, it smelled of grilled meat and red wine, two things that turn me on.Service was very in your face, we thought our waiter was South African, but it turned out he was Russian - not very good sense of accent for a guy who used to work in St Petersburg - which was where our waiter was from! Regardless, he didn't do the best job of sensing our preferred service style which was more 'leave us in peace' than 'pull up a seat and talk about the Motherland'.After asking us if we had been before, (answer 'no')He brought over the raw meat board, which was a little patronising seeing as we both work in the same industry and certainly know our Sirloin from out Strip Loin. Anyway, we went straight for big steaks with some nice accompaniments, and a bottle of red wine. Can't remember exactly what the recommendation was from the waiter, but it fell a bit short of the mark. We asked for rich and spicy, but we got big and fruity, not a major let down - but at the prices you are paying you do expect them to be bang on!Steaks were good, and came in good time, cooked to perfection. Part of the experience is watching the grill chef sweat his ass over the 20 odd steaks he has cooking in one go, this guy is truly a master of his grill. We enjoyed listening to our waiter desperately try and get the family at the table next to us to order some whiskies, so much so that I felt compelled to order one myself. A silly move seeing as I live in the home of whisky and can get much better stuff at a fraction of the price form many of my locals - lesson learned.We skipped dessert, and couldn't get an espresso as their water supply was knackered also!! They don't add a service charge, which is why our waiter demonstrated a service style of 'try hard' than 'effortless' but you couldn't faulty his effort. The bill was considerable, but I wouldn't say it wasn't value for money, though I am sure others might disagree, it was overall an enjoyable experience.",

The place was too dark and too cold, one steak was served rare when ordered medium (though in all fairness, the attentive staff quickly responded to our dissatisfaction), the other steak was not quite as tender as one expects at this price, and the fries lacked crunch.",

Our reservation got lost somehow so we had to wait a little while at the bar but it wasn't a long wait. When we got to our table, the ambience of the room was great. It felt like a nightclub and a restaurant all in one. For dinner I got the rib-eye steak with a side of spinach. It was so juicy and had a lot of flavor. We also got the veuve clicquot which really completed the meal. This place was extremely crowded and I understand why. I would love to go back if I ever get the chance.",

Maybe I don't see enough swanky restaurants in Seattle, but I was in awe by the style of this restaurant - cow fur lined on the walls and chairs/stools, black furniture, dim lighting, and chandeliers. The service was incredible, very friendly, and attentive. All the food we had was amazing as well, I'd give all of it 5 stars! We had tasty aperitifs, empanadas to start, a cut of meat I don't remember, a cheese plate, and bottle of malbec. The meat was so deliciously tender and flavorful, I wish I remembered which one I had. I love when they come out with fresh raw meat to help you decide which cut you want.This restaurant is very trendy. I went after work with my co-workers and wasn't dressed up. I would step it up a notch the next time I dine here (a must when I visit London again!) to fit in with the atmosphere. Love this restaurant!",

I've been to many fine dining restaurants in my life but this experience was close to one of the worst. Our server, not sure if the word server does him justice, was arrogant and showed no sense of pride/care serving a group of 4 males. The first, and not the last, glaring issue was we ordered still water and he gave us sparkling water. When we told him of this he only saw our table two more times. We had to go to the bar to get drinks. We had to ask other servers for tasks he should have done. This message could go on and on but I think Gaucho gets the point. The food was fantastic but the service deserves two stars at best.",

Once we were seated our lovely waiter, Juan, came over to greet us.He gave us menus told us all about the specials - with such passion I was sold! We were a little unsure about what wine to order so he explained in detail the wine menu - he then send a wine specialist over to chat to us! We tasted some lovely wine and ordered a bottle for our meal - we also ordered two mojhitos! \u00a0I ordered the starter - a tuna ceviche and it was lovely - fresh and creamy! And went perfectly with the mojhito.We then had our mains - Churrasco steaks!! AMAZING! The most beautiful steak I have ever had - i strongly recommend this cut - its marinated in citrus oils and is lovely an juicy. We had sweet potato chips and lovely humitas on the side. \u00a0I had peppercorn sauce too. I don't know what other words to use for this meal but beautiful.Everything about this place was effortless beauty. The service, the food - even the staff!

Far too many staff flanking an impressive welcome desk with a token stern looking woman on a walkie-talkie. Bags and jackets taken off to the cloakroom. An impressive start. We thought we coming for a steak - not to a hotel!We were lead downstairs by another chap who whizzed off into the darkness whilst we strained our eyes to spot where he had got to. This is not the place for those with sight difficulties. Eat your carrots before entering.The steak and the wine were phenomenal. I really liked that our waitress brought over a huge wooden slab which had all the raw cuts of meat layed out for us to see. We \u00a0were briefed on taste, texture and cooking options and helped with our decisions. We settled on a bottle of Malbec to accompany.All in all, a great experience. I'd highly recommend it. I didn't begrudge handing over my card for the sizeable bill.I'd also recommend you get that cheesecake. Wowzers it's good.",

Probably best suited for a client lunch (hence my visit), highlights included being painstakingly shown each meat cut on a wooden board, that would more than make a vegetarian squirm. I went for the fillet cut 'Bife de Lomo' rare - \u00a328 for a 300g slab or \u00a336 for a 400g man-sized chunk. Served with a selection of sides from garlic asparagus to button mushrooms with bacon lardons, I was unable to communicate for 15 minutes whilst chomping away. Lovely service to boot, with a red-lipped waitress offering us an exquisite alternative of dulce de leche as the original cheesecake had been scoffed.",

I wanted to take pictures of the place but I knew it would embarrass my classy friend.I had never been to an Argentine steak house where they bring the cuts of meat out for you to choose from, but I must say that it was a good experience. \u00a0The waiter was very nice (who isn't in London, though?) and we ended up going with his recommendations: The Bife de Lomo (fillet), bearnaise sauce, potato puree, and spinach with garlic & lemon. \u00a0Everything was fantastic! \u00a0We topped it off with the chocolate tart for dessert. Yum! \u00a0Everything here is a la carte, but a good meal is always worth a throwdown.The entire Gaucho experience was delightful, but it didn't end when we left. \u00a0As we exited the front door we started to hail a cab to head out to a pub, but the manager walked over and offered one of Gaucho's personal cabs (a black on black Mercedes Benz). \u00a0Needless to say the cab driver LOVED us. \u00a0He made a special stop at the petrol station for us to get some gum, blasted our music, drove to a few different pubs looking for the best option, and ended up driving us back to our hotel room when none of the pubs worked out. \u00a0All in all, it was over an hour ride, but very entertaining. \u00a0We weren't expecting the fifty pound tab ($81) at the end of it, but hey, it was all part of the experience.",

Just as we sat down my Neice who had given me the recommendation text to say she was in town and could join us if it was possible,I inquired with the Floor Manager and we were moved instantly to a larger table.Whilst waiting for Gemma we ordered as she knows the menu of by heart.We ordered a bottle of house Malbec as there was over 100 to choose from and this was the easy option and it was really nice.Both she and Sharon had Chorizo sausage served on confit peppers and pickled red onion, I had Empanadas, beef and smoked ham and mozzarella.We all had fillet Medallions the girls had sweet potato, and I had carrot, beetroot and roasted butternut squash. This is were they lost a star from me the sweet potato is now oven baked previously they had been chips and were much tastier, maybe not so healthy but definitely tastier, and we all opted to have Bearnaise sauce.The food was all cooked to perfection and as delicious as I had remembered, the interior is superb so much cow hide and the staff super attentive, my Daughter admitted that the steak was cooked better than she could cook it high praise indeed we will return.",

    "text": "It was really hard to decide how to rank this place but the time has come.I have previously only been to Gaucho for a drink before finally dining at the Piccadilly \u00a0a few weeks ago.I was hosting a friend who although not Argentinian, knows a considerable lot about Argentinian food and wines. So it was a really great expectation and a test to Gaucho in that sense.To start off it appears that Gaucho did not serve the apparently best and known Argentinian wine and they also happened to have ran out of the second best. We chose to start the wine on the patio outside as it was somehow dark and spooky inside but the tables seemed uneven and we had to hold our glasses tight not to spill it all over. The samples of wine were only offered to my friend who happened to be a male and it made me a bit uncomfortable as the staff assumed I was the one invited ( I'd rather not take it as sign of chauvinism-) ;)Having decided to dine, we were taken to the dining area and the nice touch was that the staff could communicate between themselves using electronic equipment which meant they could take care of our table upstairs while being downstairs.Although I absolutely love Victorian buildings in central London and the associated spookiness, the interior of the restaurant looked more like a posh night club or a castle where psychic events take place. If I hadn't been there to have a meal I'd probably be thrilled but the reality was that despite the candles, I could hardly see what was on my plate. I really love to see what I'm eating!!!!!The staff properly presented us with the steak options and food quality-wise, this restaurant delivered proper delicious Argentinian food. I know it would have tasted even better if one could feed one's eyes at the same time though. The darkness was overwhelming. Good for a date but not a dining date. I guess the food has made up for a few flaws but then again we had to wait ages for the bill whilst staff were busy having personal chats with each other. Hence as much as I loved the steak, starters and sides - it's only 3 stars for Gaucho as for this price one should really expect better.",

Their aperol spritz are massive and a great aperitif. \u00a0A fun place to go with colleagues and a larger group to share some of the side plates!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.It was late March. My husband, his coworker, and I were wandering around the area, trying to find a good dinner place. Husband's coworker, who lived in London at the time, suggested this place. Even though we didn't have a reservation, the kinda-snooty hosts managed to squeeze us in. They took our coats, put them in their coat check area (fancy), and we headed upstairs.First of all, it was very dark inside. Second, if such a thing as a Vegan Hell existed, this was it. Leather and calf hair everywhere, with an open kitchen grilling all kinds of Argentinian beef. Our server was attentive, and did a good job of explaining the various cuts they offered. We started with beef and chicken empanadas. Husband & I had the burger; coworker had steak. The food was excellent. Loved the empanadas. The burger wasn't the best I ever had, but it was close. We couldn't linger for long, because our table was reserved and our hour was up.So why only the 3.5 stars? The atmosphere. It was definitely more of a date night/formal business meeting type of place, with the prices to match. Even though our meal was on company dime, I still felt like a misplaced, underdressed tourist. (I was told to not worry about it, but I still did. That's just me, though.) If we ever find ourselves in London again, I'd consider going back.... with a reservation.",

Maybe it's a mood thing - you have to be on a 'fabulous' night out to enjoy the ambience here.Likes:I like the fact they bring the types of steak to you - for newbies! They don't give you a weird eye if you don't know which cut is which. I like their marinate and I do like the meat. I like the service - attentive and people recommend you things not necessarily based on the fact that these are the most expensive food on the menu. I like 'restaurant/bar lounge' atmosphere, that can turn into a club feeling without the dancing! So far I've tried their carousel cut, rib eye and fillet (all were good), lobster ceviche (small-ish portion and is overpriced - if you want a lobster - go to lobster & burger), majority of their sides - all good, but small if you're not going for chips, and why do you need chips if you're eating a huge steak with the plans for dessert? Sticky toffee pudding and creme brulee were amazing.Dislikes:I don't like the tiny sides. I don't like too much cowskin around (see comment about atmosphere).To sum up - if I'm up \u00a0for a steak and a night out which would paint the town red - yes. I'll go to Gaucho.",

    "text": "Sorry Gaucho but I don't really get it. Shame, I really thought this was a place I would like.On one of my typical dinners with an old work colleague, we decided to try another place in London we hadn't been to before (obviously we are spoilt for choice!). Both of us had been recommended Gaucho, so I made a reservation with no trouble and off we went. Firstly we were eyed up by a bouncer before being let in, which screams overly pretentious for a restaurant to me. But this is off Regent St, so I will forgive this minor detail. The ground floor interior was dark and plush, full of mirrors and reflective surfaces. So in short standard up market decoration, which I don't dislike. However, we then went upstairs. Now Gaucho is an Argentinian steakhouse and we booked fully aware of that. The decoration also continued upstairs, with one small twist... THERE WAS COW HIDE EVERYWHERE.This is obviously what I would call a Marmite choice of decoration - people will either love it or hate it. Can you guess which camp I belonged to?! Dear God, like all variety of animal skin I found it tacky and a bit cheap to be honest. But let's move on...We were seated and our waiter brought round the raw selection of steaks that we could choose from that evening. Now again I understand the concept of this and it was great to get a feel of the size of steak and what marinades etc. went into glazing the meat. But I don't particularly want to see the raw slab of meat before I eat it, in the same way that I wouldn't want to go to one of those fish places that asks you to choose the lobster you want them to kill and cook. I prefer my food dead thanks. The wine list was extensive and expensive - we opted for a cheaper \u00a325 bottle which I would convincingly say we could have found in other restaurants for about \u00a319. Then we ordered the steaks, both choosing rump at \u00a325 each. The steaks both came perfectly cooked - I had mine medium rare and the juices flowed out nicely. We weren't given steak knives, which I get that you shouldn't need if you cook the steak properly. But I picked rump and it was a thick cut, so the knife was just not suitable. The sauces were rich and creamy though - mushroom for my friend and smoked garlic hollandaise for me. We also had some sides and they also worked beautifully, even at \u00a35 each. Crispy chips in beef dripping and beautifully buttered root vegetables - in particular the beet root was mouthwateringly good, I just love colourful food!!After the huge steak we were too hungry for dessert, so naturally we ordered it anyway and regretted it later. Just a selection of truffles with different tastes - caramel, salt, whiskey, chilli and coffee. Nice but not quite a party in the mouth. Overall I came away from this meal full and happy, but substantially lighter in the wallet department; now I'm not a good person to listen to when judging the price of steak because I will constantly think it overpriced, I just don't understand how they justify this cost. But this was definitely overpriced, and with all the cow hide around next time I will be expecting a hoe down.",

This is crazy. \u00a0We tried another Gaucho in Hampstead with a reservation and had a much better service experience. \u00a0Suggest to Gaucho to reconsider time limits as rushing a customer through a meal will result in unnecessary pressure for both the customer and the wait staff. \u00a0I can't see this being a good business practice.",

The starters were perfect, I definitely recommend the scallops; at Gauchos they serve some of the best in London. As for the steaks, they are sublime! A wide selection of wines are offered as well as traditional and unusual cocktails. I could take or leave the desserts. Although they were good, I don't think they are as special as the starters and mains. Very attentive service, excellent knowledge of meat and advise which wine will go with your meal. If I had one criticism, it would be the lighting. Perhaps every Gaucho restaurant is dark because it adds to the experience, but I think it could be brighter. I want to see what I am eating. And of course the price! I almost had a heart attack: if you include the wine, (two bottles shared between four people) cocktails and beers before the meal; plus starter, main and dessert x4, it comes to close to five hundred pounds. Er, a nice treat! But is it worth it once a year?! Yes!",

Lastly, the service was outstanding (especially for London)...our waiter was attentive, swift, knowledgable and pleasant...and on top of that there was always a manager roaming the floor to fill any gaps and address client requests. (Nicely done!)My only negatives were the lighting in the place is either good or bad depending on what table you get (we had one with a recess light directly above us and it was like eating dinner with a bright flashlight on us the entire time...lights should never be projected directly at tables or where people are seating)....second, it was ridiculously cold in the restaurant..so cold that our food went cold after 5 minutes...which was very disappointing considering we spent over 130. \u00a0I would definitely go back again...but \u00a0request a table not under direct lighting or vents.",

I have sampled quiet a few of the buzzing steak houses in London, Hawksmoor, Goodman & Cau included but I was a first timer at Gaucho and to say I was excited was an understatement. As we entered we were greeted by friendly staff. We arrived a bit early so were asked if we would like to have a drink at the bar, which we did. The interior of Gaucho is a cross between and nightclub and secret society meeting place with wood and cow skin walls and dark lighting. As it was a birthday celebration we decided to go all out and ordered starters, mains and dessert with wine. Not exactly cheap but we knew that before we arrived. The Ecuadorian ceviche starter was delicious and a modern twist on a traditional Ecuadorian ceviche which I have had many times before. To help decide on our mains, the waitress brought out the meat board an explained all of their cuts to us. As we wanted to try a few cuts we both ordered the Gaucho tasting plate which includes three of their most popular cuts (chorizo, vacio and entrana fina) as well as various sides. The sommelier recommended their own Gaucho red to compliment our order. I must say that the meat was delicious! Each cut different but beautifully cooked and there was a lot of it. We were totally stuffed by the end but couldn't help feeling sad that the meat was gone. Desserts were good but I don't have the biggest sweet tooth so was still thinking about the steak during dessert. The staff were attentive throughout and the atmosphere inside was lively. All in all, great service, great food, great place.",

When you order, you are shown a selection of cuts and are recommended the best one according to your taste. The steak itself was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of salt. Here is a restaurant you can comfortably order a medium rare without getting something over or under. The side fries were generous and the peppercorn sauce creamy with thick consistency - perfect.Upon entering the building, you'll notice the decor looks more akin to a grand palace. The tables are a bit too small for my liking but enough to eat comfortably without hitting other tables. My only gripe with this restaurant is that the service could and should have been quicker than what it was but that may be because it was busy that day. A word to the wise - try the afternoon and not evening.",

Spinach empanadas were served cold...would have been better hot! Lomo medallions of beef were delectable and full of flavor! Sweet corn and mozzarella served on a corn husk was sinful! Flat mushrooms in garlic were delish! Abundance of dinner options made for no option but to pass on those amazing desserts... Such a shame!",

My experience is, you come out with a smile or literally they don't let you go'! haha i know its amazing! either by great food great service or if something is not at your standard, by saying its on the house madam or even better when they say would you like to order something else instead madam omg thats music to my ears, i always leave with a smile and thats why its on my top 10 restaurants in london!",

All the staff are friendly and approachable. The decor reflects the meat focus of the resturant butitcould possibly bea little brighter.It started off very quitely as we were placed up on the 1st floor. The waiting staff are very attentitive and knowledgeable about the steaks on offer. If you go to Gaucho's it is because you like your meat and they have a very good selection. The advice given by the waiting staff is spot on so if you go do listen to them once you have selected your cut of beef.If you aren't a red meat fan then never fear they do have some fish, chicken and pork on the menu!!!This is a pricey resturant but you do get what you pay for. The wines are expensive but the one I had was very nice and complimented my steak very well. \u00a0It can be a little noises once it fills up with people but not to a point where you have to shout at each other to have a conversation, unless a group of Spainards sits near you and they are a very load group (but it did not detract from the great lunch I experienced at Gaucho's)All in all I will go back as I enjoyed the experience...and more importantly the food!!",

I have been previously about three years ago.We booked online and when we got the establishment we sat in the bar area before going to our table. This is the only part of the trip which was a tad disappointing. When we where sat in the bar area it appeared that some of the staff where having a disagreement over something. This was right in front of us and there where around five members of staff involved!! After this we went and sat upstairs. This is lovely! When seated bathe waiter came to the table with a wooden slab with all the cuts of meat on. My girlfriend isn't a massive steak fan and wanted a steak with not much fat on after speaking to the waiter he advised on what steak to go for. Once we had finished our meal we sat on the \"terrace\" type thing. This is basically still inside but the roof opens. It had a lovely fireplace and was very romantic. Overall a great experience!",

Our server was super fun, full of energy, and took great care of us. Hands down the best steak I've ever had. It was super tender, and the unique marinating sauce was savory and full of flavors. My sister and I shared the 300 g Churrasco de Chorizo. I love the garlic, parsley, and olive oil marinate. It was kind of on the fatty side, but the meat was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was super juicy. The sides were also generous portions. We opted for the spinach and baked cheese cauliflower. We really enjoyed them both! The cream corn risotto was also delicious, it was just missing a little salt, but had the right amount of creaminess to it. The Dulce de Leche Cheesecake is also a must try! I was impressed with how good it was. It is now on my list of top favorite desserts. It is not too sweet, and the sauce and the cheesecake complemented each other. Too bad they don't have a location in the U.S.! If you're a steak lover or just enjoy savory steaks with bold flavors, than you must give this place a try!",

The chewy bread was my favorite!We started with the sun dried tomato empanada. Wasnt the best i have had but wasnt bad. The tuna tartare with the avocado was fresh and well made. The risotto cake was a little soggy for my liking and was very salty. The olive tapenade helped cut the salt but overall the dish fell a little flat.All the steaks were also very salty for my taste. The sirloin was a little chewy due to the fat content. \u00a0The filet mignon was probably the best steak of the bunch. Order that if you come to gaucho.For dessert, The malbec sorbet wasnt a table favorite either. Overall, it is a cool experience due to the ambiance but I would guess there are better steakhouses in london. In my opinion we had a better food experience at Mash.",

It's a classy place to dine out (although you don't have to be dressed up to come here.)The choice of steaks and sides are incredible. If you wanted some tasty, uniquely seasoned/cooked steaks come here! The server we had was great as well.Next time we are back in London we will definitely eat here!a",

The only negative point about the atmosphere in general : the music was a bit too loud and not really great for talks.The service was good. The waitress who served us was nice, friendly and smiling. She took the time to explain the menu (at the same time I was translating for my parents who can't speak English) and to help us to choose a delicious Argentinian red wine. Then we didn't wait that long to be served.Then, at last but not least: the Food. If you are a meat lover like me, this place is your heaven! You can choose your cut of beef, the marinade style if you want one and how much you want. My mom had the medallions of fillet and my dad and I ordered the chimichurri medalions of rib-eye. We ordered several sides to share (sweet potatoes, fries, mashed potatoes and some mixed salad) Everything was delicious and tasty. The meat was perfectly cooked and tender.I totally recommend this place and I will go again for more delicious meat",

Everyone was satisfied. \u00a0I personally got the ribeye - the 500g tira de ancho (spiral cut and marinated with olive oil, garlic, and parsley) cooked medium rare. \u00a0I was able to slice into it with barely any effort with a dull, serrated butter knife - beef that tender is definitely a mark of superior quality, and perfectly seasoned.Being the last night for business dinner, our group splurged on appetizers including a 5-piece sausage platter (beef, pork, chorizo, etc), empanadas (beef, mozzarella), seared scallops, and a bunch of sides including baked root veggies, fries, asparagus, and French beans. \u00a0The free bread they served was also good - lots of shapes and textures but I recommend the flat pita-like ones and the balls (like a light garlic cheese puff bread).As for wine, we got a 2011 Malbec. \u00a0Very good red wine that goes with beef. \u00a0Yes, they mark it up like 400% compared to the retail price listed on the Wine App, but hey we're in London and the wine was excellent.For dessert (skipping dessert made no sense since I blew away the daily recommended allowance already), I got the sticky toffee with ice cream and kumquats. \u00a0Pretty interesting contrast of tart and sweet from the various elements - with some added citrus from orange flavored toffee. \u00a0Definitely will recommend Gaucho again, and look forward to returning here to dine again sometime in the future. \u00a0Have to recover from my meat coma first",

Yes, it's on the expensive side, but you really do get what you pay for here - melt-in-the-mouth steak; the best burger I have ever tasted; perfect, hand-cut chips; exquisite fish and decadent desserts. I have eaten at most Gauchos and whilst each is a slightly different experience, all have continually impressed me. Dark, atmospheric and sexy, the interiors are opulent and luxuriousand subtly tongue-in-cheek. They have a very obvious passion for Argentina (all the wines on the extensive wine list are from there) and all the staff are very knowledgeable about the cultural aspects of the brand. As previous reviewers have suggested, the presentation of the cuts of beef is impressive. The menus have a fantastic long, thin, concertina design and similar attention to detail has been used throughout the experience. If you get a chance to book one of the private dining rooms, then do so - you'll be treated like a celebrity. Gaucho is well suited to an excellent romantic dinner, an impressive business lunch or a dramatic and exciting party with friends or family.",

Greeted at the door by a very lovely young man and escorted inside to de-robe (just jacket at that stage) and into the bar I went. \u00a0The cocktail list is very tempting, extensive and affordable; everything just tickles your taste buds and makes it hard to choose. \u00a0My naughty little eyes went straight for the Mojito selection and I settled on the Strawberry flavour to start. Oh time goes so quickly when you are in a cosy, atmospheric bar with friends. The decor is a variety of mediums and creates such a warm feeling. With low lighting it could eternally be midnight, which is without question a preference as I feel like I am in my 20's again, and obviously look it. After my 4thmojioto (yes 4th!) \u00a0I glided upstairs for dinner......less another layer, my jacket.At this stage I so was not really interested in dinner but the waiting staff were so friendly, polite and knowledgeable regarding the menu that I was instantly sold. The menu covers all tastes but if you are looking for good quality steak in London this is a must. The staff present each cut that is on offer and explain where it comes from (well... that's quite obvious) the difference between each cut and the flavour variations. I think it was the way that our waiter said \"Rump\" that sealed my choice. A little more conversation, a couple of Mojito's (I drink fast) and dinner was served. It was like I was channelling a Hyena as I am not sure if I took a breath whilst eating, the steak was full of flavour, melted in my mouth like, sizzled my taste buds and left me with a definite afterglow. I like to think it was the quality of the meat rather than the quantity of liquid that made it so lovely but even thinking about it now I want to go back, just superb !Unfortunately I had no more room for dessert as I do try to watch my belt notch (who likes a fatty?) but did manage one more Mojito before leaving.All in all I love Gaucho and if they allow me back it could definitely become a regular haunt. The staff are adorable, the decor is impeccable and the food outstanding. If you see a nearly nude little guy in the corner with a Mojito, enjoying himself (in a nice way), come and say hello.",

    "text": "This could definitely be a 4 star restaurant but for two issues. First the pros - the ambiance is very cool. There is a nice trendy bar area downstairs, the decor is smart with cowhide coverings. Sounds odd - but it works! Upstairs we actually were seated next to the chef who grills all the meat. Fun to watch but not necessarily best table in the house. When ordering the server brings you a wooden board with a selection of the cuts they offer. My daughter and I ordered a very large marinated rib eye cut to share and my husband ordered a very large filet. They were prepared well and to our specifics. The first issue wasmour sides were cold. When we were finally able to bring it to our servers attention he made some comment I couldn't understand and never returned. That would be the second issue. It is absolutely acceptable to make mistakes and its a true show of the level of service when the mistake is taken care of quickly and properly. When I was finally able to flag him down to get our check (we had no check back following when I alerted to him to the problem with the sides) he acted surprised when he asked me if we had gotten our replacements for the sides and I answered no. He did remove them from the bill which I appreciated but it was a bit too late. So in summary, the meat was wonderful, the atmosphere cool but poor service.",

    "text": "Another decent London eatery. it's a bit gimmicky but the steak is good and this is probably the only reason to go. I went at lunch and the service was very swish, slightly obsequious and probably slightly too frequent. I love the theatrical presentation of the various cuts of raw meat at the start of the meal and the beef itself was terrific. Slightly cliched trendy decor; trying slightly too hard. Justifies the higher prices. Anyway, go for the steak and you'll be happy.",

I had the fillet and it was incredible - cooked just as I like it, and they don't give you a steak knife because the steak's meant to be so tender it doesn't need one. I love the way they show you the board of meat before they cook it for you, too!!",

The choice of dishes isn't vast. The price is a touch on the wrong side of reasonable. However the steak is possibly the finest I've tasted. Cooked to perfection (bloody as hell), with a selection of grilled veg and choice of mouth-watering sauces, or for the puritans amongst us, with just a fine dusting of freshly ground black pepper. As I mentioned though, it isn't cheap, so try to make sure someone else (the company!) picks up the bill.",
