My one criticism would be - who thought people would want to eat noodles in this setting? It may all be great stuff, but something doesn't quite add up there.",

    "text": "Tuckered out by a long week, weather refusing to decide what it was going to be I dragged my girlfriend to the Pineapple for a quick post pint last Friday. She's from Canada, travelled and lived all corners of the world which generally makes me feel a little inferior in the life experience department (it's my own hangup) So despite the fact she's lived here for 3 years, I'm always keen to show her some proper, quintessential English things. May I quickly tell you that I haven't a patriotic bone in my body so I'm not pulling rank or nothing. The Pineapple is full to the scuppers with local waifs and strays. A few years ago there was a battle to keep from the developers sticky paws and it seems now to go from strength to strength. It's cramped and old school, full of the original features that have been given a face lift rather than an overhaul. Out the back there is a conservatory which, when hired out as it was last friday, leaves the rest of the pub standing room only and near unbearable. And out through the conservatory is a very modest l-shaped garden. I haven't eaten here since they opted for a thai menu but I know that a majority of those that prop up the bar were somewhat annoyed an baffled by the change of menus. It was a litle overwhelming for my Canadian the day we went, we ended up out on the pavement finishing our drinks as the volume grew inside. But I love this pub, inside, outside, half empty or totally full. It's proper.",

They have an amazing thai restaurant, meals all under a tenner, and they are brilliant. Oh and they have boardgames too. \u00a0And the last Sunday afternoon somehow a whole platter of sausages, bread rolls and ketchup appeared on the bar for everyone to tuck into.

After many days in a row of British food and beer for lunch and dinner, my friends and I hungered for a meal that would feel a little lighter in the tummy but could still be washed down with some delicious local brews. Well, the Pineapple hit the spot! I had some tasty tasty soup and spring rolls; my less cheap friends enjoyed their curries and noodle dishes and fried rice. The food was good, simple, slightly spicy (wish it had been spicier but it was still good!) Thai food. And the selection of drinks was good! Pub atmosphere, Thai food. Perfect. I would recommend coming here a little early because it isn't that big and sitting upstairs is kind of lonely and not the same pub atmosphere. Now, if only they could open a Pineapple branch back home in California...a girl can dream.",

The crowd is mostly local but always friendly - it can buzz of a Friday/Saturday night but 9 times out of 10 you'll still find a cozy nook to call your own. 4 ever-changing real ales and several nicely priced lagers at your disposal.

The inside of the pub is lovely, with a few different organic ciders on tap (yay!). The staff are friendly and the food has always looked gorgeous. \u00a0Out in back, there's a lovely conservatory with ferns and potted palm trees scattered about. The conservatory is an excellent place to hang out if it is raining outside, because you stay dry and cozy, \u00a0but if it is calm enough outside, you can open the doors to bring in the pitter-patter of the falling rain. The garden is great, almost entirely covered in gigantic deck umbrellas (maybe just for the winter? I don't remember these from last summer) and heated by bright glowy red heating lamps. There's a nice assortment of big and small tables, both round and rectangular, so tables can be pushed together to accommodate groups of any size. In fact, the beer garden is often considerably less crowded than the inside of the pub, so if everyone is comfy outside, \u00a0this can be a nice little way to escape the often quite crowded interior. The Pineapple is a really wonderful, homey pub with a great atmosphere. Now that we've got a little sunshine back in our forecast, I'm looking forward to spending some more long, leisurely summer evenings lounging out in the garden with a nice cold cider, a pair of sunglasses, and a big smile on my face.",

I will definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Cheers!!!",

Good Thai food, smaller portions than we're accustomed to but plenty to eat and with one soup, one seafood fried rice, and a pad Thai, we left very satisfied. My fianc\u00e9 enjoyed a local brew and I loved the ambiance. Hope to go back again before we leave town. It's located in a quiet neighborhood and we felt safe walking there and back to our rented flat in Camden.",

    "text": "What a lovely, lovely pub.A couple of my neighbours told me that this is their favourite pub in the area, so we have been meaning to visit for a while. As everyone has already mentioned, it is a busy pub with a relaxed atmosphere on a residential street (between Kentish Town and Tufnell Park.) There is a large conservatory area in the back and plenty of space in the beer garden. They have a good selection of interesting beers and ales (and there was a 'cider pop up' in the corner when we were there last night.) While I was ordering, the bar man knew the order of a lady's husband better than she did, and he had a white wine ready for another man before he needed to ask for it...so it sounds like quite a few people come here a lot!Food:Everyone else that has reviewed the pineapple seems to rave about the food, so maybe I expected too much. I thought it was good, but not amazing... it isn't as good as the Thai restaurant around the corner.- The starters seemed like buy-them-frozen-and-stick-them-in-the-oven jobbies. Nice, but the same as you might buy from M&S and heat up at home.- The Pad Thai was just allright- The red curry was creamy and really goodBUT it is cheap, and the portions are huge. If you don't expect anything gourmet, then it's not bad.",

What a delight to enjoy natural light instead of the normal pub dungeon experience. I was impressed with their Merlot, but then came the food and WOW! I love Thai food and have been searching for the best Thai restaurant in London. The Pineapple now tops my list. I had the red curry with tofu and the tofu was cooked so well, unlike many other places I have tried. It is affordable as well, and a completely comfortable dining environment. I can't wait to return!",

We chose this place mostly because it was just a few blocks down from where we were staying, and I did really like the atmosphere. There was a range of seating to choose from and a shelf with board games. They also have a nice selection of local beers on tap, so this definitely would make for a nice place to lounge. The food, though, seemed to range from meh to decent. We ordered the appetizer platter with the spring rolls, golden triangles and one other one which I'm forgetting (whoops) and it was pretty unremarkable. They all kind of seemed like the microwave package variety. I got the pad thai which was fine, but nothing incredible. Probably a bit too sweet. It wasn't too expensive though, especially for London.This seems like more of a place to drink than to eat and for a neighborhood pub, it's quite cozy. It wouldn't be my first choice for food but it's also far from bad if you want it all in the same place.",

I must say it has to be some of the best I've had in London and I know my Thai food!! I had the Satai; chicken was moist and the peanut sauce was legit! Then I had the duck red curry. Perfect spice balance where the heat was continuous without being overwhelming. Veggies were fresh and crunchy and the coconut milk was on the mark! Only downside was that the rice was too sticky.All in all I highly recommend this place!! Oh and the ales are not bad!!",

    "text": "It might not have the frenetic buzz of Camden, but leafy Kentish Town does have some absolutely smashing hostelries for a high quality ale alongside a bunch of faithful locals, some of whom have definitely been coming to the same pub, on the same night, for about 30 years... which is obviously testament to a pub's loyalty calibre, let's be honest.The Pineapple is one of those endlessly popular venues. Snugly situated on a quiet street just off busy Fortress Road, this is a backstreet boozer that's earned its quality taps, pulling in a good mix of ages and North London residents to successful effect. One of the most surprising features on my first visit was the widely lauded Thai food menu - and it is, as they all said it would be, delicious. You might not feel like a pint of Leffe and a Thai Green Curry concoction would go hand in hand as culinary playmates, but they do - and they get on magnificently. Last time I came here I ate far too much, and enjoyed every minute of it while sitting in the conservatory through the back and trying half pints of a number of the ales on offer... Definite tip though: It's always busy. If you're planning any sort of date/social event that requires seating, you might want to arrive an hour early and hawk out a space well in advance.",

This is as close as you get to proper Thai, even compared to posh restaurants like Mango Tree, and a steal at \u00a37 for a main. They have all the options - red curry, green curry, penang - but I always go for the noodle dishes as they're the shining stars - pad thai, pad see uw, pad kee mao. For vegetarians, there are both tofu and vegetable options, and they can tell you which items are gluten-free.There are lots of little rooms with nooks and crannies for your intimate evening, and a big indoor/outdoor patio for group parties.Additionally, Monday nights at 8 they have the most difficult pub quiz in town. I've considered moving to Kentish Town just to be near the Pineapple.",

I've been coming here for over three years now, if I haven't keyboarded my thoughts yet it must only be because my inarticulate awkward prose wouldn't do the pub justice.The Ananas has a traditional pub appearance at the front, with a more modern conservatory at the back. Both areas are nice places to sit. I actually tend towards the back as it is usually a bit emptier.Five beers, all of them likely to be interesting. Redemption Trinity seems to be a regular of late, which is handy as it is a cracking pint! The Thai food is recommended too, should ye be peckish.I've always found the staff mighty friendly, particularly the manager Simon.If the pub has one minor drawback then it is the congestion that builds up just inside the entrance where new arrivals meet the backs of still thirsty occupiers.Developers wanted to turn them into flats! They survived! An internal roof collapsed. They fixed it and moved on! Er...long live The Pineapple.",
