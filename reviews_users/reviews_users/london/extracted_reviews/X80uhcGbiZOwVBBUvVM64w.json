    "text": "wagamama has lots of potential. I saw other customers with dishes that looked amazingly tasty. Mine, though, was underwhelming. I made a stir fry myself the next night that was tastier, and healthier too. My friends, though, all seemed to enjoy their food, not least the white chocolate cheesecake they all shared. I didn't participate in the cake because I love only one chocolate--milk chocolate. Wagamama has a fun atmosphere, and it seems like a good place for large groups, what with the long tables and bag racks underneath. The service was friendly and efficient as well. Maybe I'll just order something else the next time.",

It was rather noisy at the start of the evening.Although they were busy and we had felt a bit ignored to start with, the service was very good such that my husband, one who doesn't normally tip, made a point of including a tip when he paid!",

FREE FOOD??!?!? I mean... come on now!? It WAS rank to be fair but hey, waste not want not right?I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry (I usually go for the veg option but Carpe Diem and all that) which took longer than average to arrive. Ok, It was edible but in all honesty completely overcooked. I was offered a brand new one but I was so hungry my stomach had more rumble than a tumble dryer so I declined.Staff were all SUPER polite! You know that leaving the restaurant thinking \"ahhhh she was REALLLLLLLY nice\" kind of polite. Manager was BRILLIANT too.. the way she says \"I don't like it\" completely made my day. I don't suggest you ask her to say it but it was definitely a highlight, LOVELY woman.All in all a top class experience with mediocre food but these places are always touch and go depending on the chef.",

Just what you need when inebriated.A friend and I ordered the yummy Gyoza dumplings to start which pack a punch and are great to share with friends; and then the Ginger Chicken Udon which arrived in about five minutes flat, was ridiculously tasty and came in super generous portions.

    "text": "I had wanted to visit Wagamama's for ages having heard such great things about their Asian approach to fast food. I'd even looked at the menu a couple of times online to figure out what I would order if the opportunity presented itself. Unfortunately, when I finally sat down at a table in the Clink Street branch the waitress instructed me that they had sold out of all the items I wanted. I was pretty gutted that they didn't have any dumplings left or any noodle dishes with prawns. It was only 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon so I wondered how much more they would run out of by the end of the day.The food we did order was very nice although I made the mistake of ordering a salad and had a bit of carb envy over my friends' noodles. She found her dish a bit too spicy but I think she brought that on herself by ordering the Chilli Beef Ramen. Everything arrived very quickly and we enjoyed a couple of Wagamama's fresh juices.Although I'd go back to Wagamama's in the future, it wouldn't be my first choice for Thai food or even my third or forth. It was great that our food arrived so fast but, as soon as we had finished our plates were lifted so quickly it was clear that the waitress wanted us out of there. Obviously this is a fast food restaurant and so these things have to be expected but I'm more of a sit back and relax kind of girl. Wagamama's is good but maybe we're just not suited to each other.",

    "text": "When a menu is standard across so many restaurants it seems slightly weird to review a particular branch of a chain, but over the last couple of months I've eaten Wagamama's brilliant nosh in such a variety of places I thought it worth assessing my experiences. This riverside branch is my favourite because of the location - I like knowing I'm near water even if I can't see it from my table. I've eaten here three times in recent months to refuel partway through vocal recording sessions in Borough and came once at peak lunchtime and twice around 3pm, and while the food was superb every time the staff were patchy. On the last occasion my colleague and I arrived just after the lunch rush. The place was nearly empty of customers and staff it seemed, as we hung around by the front door sniffing the fragrant noodle-y air wistfully. Remember that when the tummy is empty the urgency of time presses more firmly on a person, so forgive us for losing patience, foraging for menus and seating ourselves, accompanied by a little huff-and-puff. Still no-one came to welcome us - mighty strange, we thought. But as I trotted off to use the loo the mystery was revealed when I passed a bustling table at the back of the restaurant marked Staff Dining. That's where everyone was! Warning - this Wagamama's can be lethal. It's way too tempting to curtail any semblance of a productive work day by nipping in to Vinopolis (next door) when you've finished your healthy lunch. Leave via the river!",

As for the others, they are all so lovely. The service has always been consistently good, food is cheap, tasty and interesting. I'm sure everyone has something they like at Wagamama. I personally love the chilli beef ramen, as well as the chicken katsu curry. But one thing I must have whenever I go there is the edamame! Especially if you get to flick them at your friends and loved ones.",

Food was up to w.mama's usual standards, however service was very brief, with there being far fewer staff than i would expect of a restaurant that size. Usual wagamama style, but with railway arch type feel. It did exactly as planned - decent food of known standard, quickly. But if i was looking for somewhere special to go, then i would choose another venue.",

Would come back again, and also interested in maybe trying their locations in NYC to see how it compares.",

Luckily our server was very courteous and brought us a round of drinks on the house and dessert was on the house. His customer service went above and beyond which saved our second experience at wagamama. The food was delicious. We ordered to start pork gyoza, I recommend getting them grilled. My main meal was the short rib ramen. The rib was so tender and the meat fell right off the short bone... mouth watering haha. Overall, I'd recommend the ramen it will come out the quickest.",

    "text": "On our way to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in Southwark, we chanced upon Wagamama. My friend had suggested this place to us, but we did not know if we were going to have the time to seek it out. So, we decided that this will be our post-theatre dining venue that evening since it is on the way back to the London Bridge tube station from The Globe Theatre. We started with the Chili Garlic Salt Edamame and the Pulled Pork Gyoza. The edamame was really good. The chili and salt gave it an extra kick of flavor. My husband and I both did not like the Pulled Pork Gyoza however. Too sweet! Both the filling and the sauce were sweet, so that taste overpowered everything else. You need to balance out that sweetness with some extra acidity. Maybe more vinegar in the sauce?It was disappointing not to see tonkotsu listed on the ramen part of the menu, but I thought I'd try the ramen anyway. They only serve miso based soups. I settled for the Wagamama ramen which seemed to have everything under the sun in it. It had chicken, pork, clams, mussels, shrimp and a tea stained egg. The egg yolk was overdone and the broth was just okay. The chicken was tasteless, and the other stuff in it, again, just okay. \u00a0I would not recommend this dish. Try maybe one of the curries or the Yaki Udon. My husband had the Yaki Udon dish and it was good. It had a nice flavor and the thick noodles made the dish filling enough. However, it's not a very generous amount, so if you are hungry, don't share it with others. Service was good and our food came out in a timely manner. Note that the service charge is not included in the check, so you will have to add a 12% tip.",

As said, when we asked for our dishes without nuts, one of the managers personally came to check on other allergies and informed us that there are nuts in the kitchen in general so would we be okay with that. Overall, a solid experience, though I'd like to try out some other dishes to get a true sense.",

Between people talking and the music trying to drown them out I never ended up with what I had ordered. First they brought the entirely wrong order to us. Then everyone else's food arrived, and my pork gyoza (steamed) somehow it ended up being steamed pork buns. When they realized they had gotten it wrong they attempted to fix it, and that somehow turned into duck gyoza (fried). I finally just gave up. They gave us the pork buns free, but none of us wanted them so they just sat there. The most frustrating thing was someone else in our party also ordered pork gyoza and they arrived with no issue. There are better places to eat than here, and I would recommend passing this place by; at least this particular location. Also the sauce that came with the gyoza was beyond sickly sweet.",

When you're steps away from Borough Market, if the traders are there, you should be there, too. If you find yourself caught out, this Wagamama will be just fine.",

The portions are huge and a late lunch will easily keep you satisfied until late evening. They offer a few Asian branded beers to purchase by the bottle, FREE hot green tea, and fresh pressed juices, as well as the standard soft drinks. In general, the service is pretty great, but expect to get your food as it's ready - not everyone at the table receives their food at the same time. Many restaurants in London are kid-friendly, but Wagamama takes it a step further with an affordable kids' menu of with kid-friendly versions and portions of food from the regular menu, high chairs, and training chopsticks for the little ones.",

The final straw (mixing metaphors here) was having the ONLY section completely in the shade closed off to paying customers. \u00a0It seems the employees NEEDED this area to sit around, shoot the shit, and generally ignore their melting customers. \u00a0It's sad when the customers have to show the employees how to operate the blinds in the front of the restaurant.The food may have been amazing, but it's hard to appreciate when you're suffering the effects of heat stroke. \u00a0An apathetic staff didn't help the ambiance either. \u00a0As much as I love this chain I won't be returning to this location.",
