But if part of the deal of going to a posh restaurant is being excited, feeling a buzz, this place isn't for you. It's the sort of place that requires you to whisper. The sound of fork clinking on plate echoes around, along with a few murmurs from the diners and the dull hum of the traffic on the A40. Cough and heads will turn.Our waiter's hovering skills put a humming bird's to shame. The staff are perfectly nice but you just want them to let go a little. Crack a smile. I won't tell Marcus Waering, promise.The food is solid but unspectacular. I ordered quail which hadn't seen much heat. It was carefully done, but would have benefitted from a bit of fierceness and bravery. Burnished quail is nice but I don't think it would be allowed here. The chicken Kiev came as this neatly rolled uniformly breadcrumbed log. The butter and garlic inside was subdued when it appeared. I like mine to erupt like a volcano. Nothing to thrill, although the three snails that came with it were a nice touch. More of that please. Braised oxtail was tender and tasty but again all a bit correct in its presentation. Sides too. The experience was pleasant but a bit austere. It all felt a bit repressed. Vibrant and expressive aren't words that would crop up when talking about the Gilbert Scott. I left with an overriding feeling of relief that I wasn't payingAcross the road is Karpo. A place where every dish that comes out delights the eye and the taste buds. It's not a great building but the people there are enjoying their cooking and that makes for a great vibe. It's three times cheaper too. \u00a0If you're treating your great aunt, the Gilbert Scott will work well. If you're after a bit more spirit, do a frogger and get yourself across the A40.",

With and immaculately restored interior complete with period architectural elements and high ceilings there is little to complain about in terms of the look and feel of the place, and the long winding corridors made me think of the castles and palaces from children's TV programmes in my more youthful days... In this grand setting it's a real joy to be able to partake in perfectly made cocktails, pink champagne by the bucket load or just an exceedingly well poured pint by staff that know their thing, and who are at the same time both perfectly attentive and also give you enough space to enjoy the conversations you're enjoying with those that you're sharing the grandeur with. The only thing I can think to even mildly grumble about was the addition of an automatic service charge, which I personally abhor - but with service as good as it was, they probably ended up doing themselves out of a couple of quid in adding the tip so matter of factly to the bill. Yes, it's a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for and this place is stunning.",

You immediately feel fabulous! The dining area features high ceilings, and overall elegant decor & lighting. As for the menu, the fact that they focus on serving British food should be applauded; it's a great portal for tourists to discover that British food isn't just fish & chips or pies. Service was excellent but not overly fussy. I had a white asparagus with fried duck egg main which was perfectly done, light and delicious. My companion had the salmon & rocket main which she said was excellent. The wine list seemed varied & plentiful, but as this was a business meal I didn't spend too much time staring at it and I stuck with a modest glass of Pinot Noir, light & flavourful, and not a bad price (here) at \u00a36.50 for a 175ml glass. If you are looking to choose somewhere nice to go in the station I recommend this restaurant above the nearby St. Pancras Grand Brasserie. The food there is very good but the service doesn't match The Gilbert Scott. I'm looking forward to returning, perhaps to savour their enticing Sunday roast menu.",

The staff in the cocktail bar are very efficient and quick, while the staff in the restaurant seem confused and don't understand much English with the exception of one or two people - am usually very relaxed about this, but they just seemed disinterested. \u00a0The service was fairly lacking. \u00a0In a place as grand as this, they should be more polished.",

    "text": "Where to start with The Gilbert Scott. Lets start with the venue, situated in St Pancras, the grand entrace leads you up into the reception through revolving doors into the bar area where you are greeted with some of the finest Art Deco fixtures and restoration of the original interior you'll find in London. The Maitre d could not have been more welcoming and showed us to the bar where cocktails are the order of the day. Myself and Fianc\u00e9 ordered a couple of 'eye openers' that certainly hit the mark. The barman was very helpful and slick, but had none of the flair bartending that you see in so many 'crap cocktail bars' \u00a0straight down to business and delivered a couple of excellent drinks.So far, so goodWe were booked into the 'early evening supper' and was shown to the grand dining hall, think more of the same as the bar area but with much more spacethis is where the Gilbert Scott took off. The staff were excellent. Make no mistake, there is helpful in a desperate way, and there is helpful in a 'helpful wayluckily TGS staff fell into the latter category. After reading the very British Menu (good for them)we immediately changed from a set menu to the full restaurant menu because the set menu had only whetted our appetites to try more. My Fianc\u00e9 ordered the Potted Shrimps and I ordered the Dorset Squid and Chorizo (farmed locally) \u00a0bothe dishes were fantastic and portioned very well. The mains were 'fish and Chips' and Hallibut with Razor Clams \u00a0again, everything was cooked to perfection. Destert was a Lancashire Cheese, Welsh Cakes and Apricot Chutney and Eton Mess \u00a0both were, as the previos courses, excellent. This was all washed down with a cheeky red from New Zealand that although red, went so well with our fish heavy meal. A desert wine and a port rounded off one off the best experiences I have had in the Capital for a while. We also inquired about the Chefs Table and were shown into the kitchen where we met the chef and had a look around. Something we may consider for the future when we have \u00a3800 \u00a0but, that consists of a seven course tasting menu, personal waiter and Sommelier \u00a0all this for 10 persons takes that to \u00a380 a head, minus wine but consider that to some other Chefs tables where you wont get change out of \u00a31500, puts the Gilbert Scott into perspective.The bill was not cheap, I didn't expect it to be, but it was worth every penny and we left with smiles on our faces and a promise to return again in the near future.My only minor critique would be the courses came rather fast \u00a0this may have been because of the time of day 19.00 ish \u00a0we would normally eat 20.00 onwards. And the wine was not cheap \u00a0I think the cheapest bottle was \u00a340 \u00a0which is on the high sideperhaps we need something around the \u00a325 mark.All in all, this place deserves the credit I hope it gets. Providing it can continue to produce the quality of food and delivery and bring the wine list down a bit, TGS has the potential to be up there with the best places in London. I only hope it doesn't become a victim of its own success and drops its standard because a D List celebrity is seen there. I can't wait for Winter when the menu will change!Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "Decided to book here for my wife's birthday, and were not disappointed. While I think there was overall some niggles that could be resolved, I was quite pleased with the outcome overall. We arrived slightly before our booked time and were shown to our table. It had the corner of a larger booth, so we sit on the two adjoining sides of a table rather than opposite each other. First niggle was when we got our menus - we'd booked because of the set menu at the time, and yet they only brought the al la carte one - we had to ask for the set menu (despite being in the middle of the timeslot that the set menu could be ordered from, and a table next to us already ordering from that menu).But this was only a niggle - but then I was concerned that the lamb shoulder could be fatty as a main, and so opted to pay the extra to get the steak. The missus had the lamb shoulder, and I regret not going for it - it was pulled lamb stacked into a little cake. It totally needed some potatoes, so we were glad that we ordered a mashed potato side to go with it. Stunning mash as well. For my steak, it came with fries, and a really good bearnaise sauce which had the consistency of a foam. It had to be teased out of the little gravy boat it came in. But a thoroughly good pair of mains - although the lamb was by far the superior dish.Dessert was disappointing. On the set menu, there was a choice of carrot cake, a panna cotta, a cheese course (that was extra) and a undescriptive dish of raspberries, poppy seed and lemon. We were both excited by the carrot cake, but it wasn't a great one and was disappointing. I could see how it was a take on a carrot cake, but frankly I would have preferred to get a far more typical cake. The service was 95% good and the rest a bit iffy. The staff managed to keep busy the entire time, yet were there when you wanted one. Only at the start with the menus did we have something unexpected happen. My only other gripe is the \u00a32 charge per person for the upkeep of the building - I'm rather surprised that is required by the restaurant considering that \u00a0it could be rolled into the cost of the dishes. Or just make the set menu \u00a331 a head instead of \u00a329 and don't tell me I'm paying for it.",

Really loved the decor in this lovely bar (part of The St Pancreas Renaissance hotel) - plush leather seats, dim lighting and a grand bar. It's not cheap in terms of prices (one of those places where the coaster and snacks -popcorn -arrive before your drink does). But when the drink does arrive, my are you impressed - perfectly made, quite potent and beautifully presented. Definitely a place to go if you fancy splashing the cash, but definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "The Gilbert Scott a restaurant part of the grand St Pancras Renaissance A restaurant sympathetically designed to fit in as part of the old historical Victorian hotel it's linked to offering an all day dining option including a wonderful afternoon tea at their bar. The bar is quite dimly lit and it's dark grey leather banquets and chairs against its deep red walls doesn't help make it any brighter, But that doesn't distract you from the grandness of the bar and it's beautiful intricate design with it's golden ornately corniced tripe high ceilings and bell shaped chandeliers dangling from them. The bar isn't exactly big \u00a0and on a Saturday afternoon it was quite dead which somewhat reduces the romantic aspect of it.However staff definitely made up for the lack of atmosphere with their consistent friendly approach at all time, all dressed professionally. We ordered the classic afternoon tea for 2 for \u00a329.99. A delicious selection of sandwiches, cakes, pastries and scones. They even refilled our sandwich platter immediately after we finished the first platter without us asking and we even went through a third platter afterwards. Our sandwiches included coronation chicken, egg and cress and trout mayonnaise, all deliciously made. The breads were pillow soft and fresh and varied from wholemeal to white bread,Coronation chicken -Very moreish with the mild creamy spices and succulent pulled chicken inside. Egg and cress- Was a fine concoction made from high quality eggs with rich yolks and creamy mayonnaise. Trout mayonnaise- Was lovely and full on flavour. Some may find it too fishy but I very much liked it. The trout was fresh, sweet and flaky soft, accentuated by the mayonnaise that brought it together. Sausage roll. This was definitely the highlight. The pork meat was fragrant, grounded with herbs which really boost its flavours and that golden crispy pastry really contrasted well with the filling.For the dessert section we were given chocolate tarts, lemon meringue tarts, coffee eclair, elderflower and poppy cake and a strawberry panna cotta. The chocolate tart was very smooth, a velvety light layer of chocolate mousse on top of a richer darker chocolate filling underneath. In terms of sweetness it was perfect and the tart itself was buttery and moist. The coffee eclair however was slightly too sickly sweet for me with the coffee cream inside being too overloaded with sugar so the coffee taste was very mild. But I still appreciated the freshest of the pastry and how delicately thin and airy it was. The lemon meringue tart was very refreshing, with the perfect ratio of sweet and sour so the sourness wasn't too overwhelming but just there to leave a lovely zesty note across the tart with the lovely creamy marshmallow balancing it out.Elderflower poppy cake was incredibly moist and light, again not too sweet. The poppy seed gave it an interesting texture whilst the elderflower gave it a slight floral essence. The panna cotta was fantastic, thick and creamy with strong vanilla notes. The nuts added a lovely nutty flavour as well a contrast in texture and finished nicely with fresh bed sweet strawberries to lighten the heaviness.Scones Not the best scones I've had but still very fluffy and creamy. They were slightly dense but still very fragrant and buttery and the generous clotted cream and strawberry jam helped soften the textures, allowing me to make my own little masterpiece. They were all very high quality with plenty of strawberry bits in the jam giving it more that natural sweetness rather than just sugar. When it came down to food and the quality of the teas and sandwiches, The Gilbert Scott afternoon tea is definitely one of my favourites, beating the Ritz and Ting at the Shard. Everything was fresh, unique sandwich idea which made it refreshing and paired with excellent service. However it's small venue, cold dimmed lighting and emptiness does make it a lot less attractive compared to other afternoon places. But for \u00a329.00 I'm definitely please with my experience there. Hopefully it will gain in popularity so next time I go, the lack of atmosphere will no longer be a problem.",

    "text": "Do you like cocktails and are you in London. That's not a question, that's a statement. Don't miss out on the Gilbert Scott!You will step into the magical world of Renaissance meets decadence. This establishment is so ultimately cool, classy, and will serve you fan-fabulous-tastic tasting cocktails. Full stop. I've been here now seven times, ever since my colleague first brought me here on my first work-related trip and I always ALWAYS make sure to go every time I'm in London. Let's start with THE thing we \"can't\" do in Amsterdam - the service. It's so polite, accurate and reall fast. We order 7 cocktails with our group and BAM - they're there in about 15 minutes. Mind you, as a former cocktail shaker I can tell you, that's fast. Second, the price/quality rate is something that we Dutch drool over - yes we're 'cheap' - and what you get for the price: I'm absolutely loving it. You spend \u00a310 - \u00a314 for a cocktail and to be fair: that's a lot of money for a drink. So, in return, you expect (and should!) get a proper drink for that. And you do. You, definitely do. Third, the food. The \"bar food\" are small portions but order two: and you have a meal (talking to the girls here). Boys need more food. Proper food. Order the burger (\u00a313) and it's definitely worth your money - a luscious, juicy burger with relish (hello mustard! You're my new best friend) and chips. I had the mackerel pat\u00e9 and falafels - the pat\u00e9 I can't even describe how much of a fan I am. Just to be clear: I'm a huge fan. The falafels, not so much. I found them a dry. The cumin sauce is something you need to be able ordering separately - I literally drowned my chips in there. But the falafels... MEH. But maybe, I'm not a falafel-girl - in general I tend to find falafels quite dry.Can I please say something about the service again? The men dress properly. They speak properly (and taking the 'British' into account here as well: they are more polite than the Dutch can ever be, but even for their standards) and they are sophisticatedly hot. Just sayin'.Overall - go there. Go team GO!",

It also became rather difficult to flag her down when we needed something. This was a tad frustrating considering that other than one party of three, my fiance and I \u00a0were the only other patrons in the restaurant.

Shortly after seating us, our coats were taken, given the drinks menu and one of my favourite snacks was placed in front of us - popcorn! However, this was no ordinary treat, it tasted like bacon! I kid you not, it was delectable, and at a guess I reckon that the kernels were popped in bacon fat. That may sound gross but I don't give two hoots, two of my favorite things pig and corn! It was splendid and I'd suggest tasting it at least once, is a must. It's hard to fit the bar into a single time period but something about the geometric iron structure that the bar was housed in, brought to mind the Jekyll & Hyde thriller, with perhaps also a dash of Sherlock too.I went for the 'Queen Mother' cocktail which included gin, rhubarb and champagne - more of the things I love, in one glass. Happy days!To finish I'd like to add this short description from the official website, not only the perfect ending to this review, but Gilbert Scott would be the perfect ending to any day...'Through the revolving door (originally one of the first in the UK) our Bar at The Gilbert Scott occupies the former entrance to the Midland Grand Hotel. With ornately painted ceilings and wondrous bell chandeliers you are instantly swept up in the grandeur of the space. Exuding elements of sophistication and wonder, the Bar sets the scene for an afternoon of enjoyment or an evening sampling the cocktail or champagne lists.'",

    "text": "As a non-newbie visitor to London (okay, okay. I'm a tourist!), my travelling party and I were looking for a fancy treat of a lunch that brought together history, architecture, and of course, fine food.A friend of ours in London suggested The Gilbert Scott, and are we ever glad we followed his advice. We made reservations online for lunch, and were enamoured the moment we walked into the beautiful dining room. From start (rich and creamy Americanos) to finish (delectably light desserts) and everything in between (watercress soups, fish, the list goes on), this was definitely one of our most memorable, and drawn out, meals in London.Definitely something to consider if you're looking to reaaallly make an afternoon out of a meal. Hats off to you, Gilbert!",
