    "text": "Went to this restaurant yesterday, having been there 2 years ago and was really disappointed. We arrived at about 2.30 p.m. to find it was extremely busy but was assured a table was just about to be vacated and we could have it once it had been cleaned and laid for us. Then the Manageress advised that waitress that people had been waiting outside and they had first dibs on that table. So we were offered the window seats with high stools (extremely uncomfortable) and not very practical for the three of us to share our intended starter!!!! We're really like the edamame there and ordered this for the three of us to share and at the same time asked if we could move to a proper table when one became available. We also ordered main dishes for each of us. Having sat at the table a different waiter brought us our main dishes and I told him we'd asked for the edamame first and he just went away without looking into it so we assumed he was going to go and bring it to us. A while later we enquired of our orignal waitress about the edamame to be told Jesus, I forgot to order it! Would you like me to order it for you? Well, frankly by that time it was getting late and we needed to get to Euston to catch a train home, so declined, but there was no apology at her oversight. We tried to ask for our bill but the Manageress, with a vacant look on her face, only seemed to be aware of people coming in through the door and walked back and forth between the till and the door totally ignoring us trying to catch her attention. We love the Giraffe food but I guarantee we'll not be returning to this branch as it's plain their customer service leaves much to be desired.",

    "text": "There are now numerous Giraffes all over the city, but I think the brunswick was one of the early ones. My friends with kids love this place, they take them there for brunch practically every week. I have to admit it is a very family friendly restaurant, with booths at the back, activity sheets and crayons. Enough to keep them occupied until the food arrives. The menu is also child orientated, with kids meals as well as lots of burgers and dishes that come with fries. It is therefore also a good place to take friends who are not hugely adventurous, as most of the food is not too spicy or exotic. Everything is tasty enough, but sometimes it is not cooked fantastically well, being either over or under done. I used to like the Giraffe in Spitalfields a lot, so I wonder whether it is just menu fatigue brought on by the fact that the place has become such a large chain.",

The location in the Brunswick square is nice and quiet and hidden from cars and the restaurant named Giraffe with a orange decoration seemed friendly to say the least!The deal was for a starter and main \u00a37.95 and after the drinks were also two in the price of one, we were very happy. For a starter I had deep fried shrimps and for main a creek salad. The portion with the shrimps was really small, tasteless and created without absolutely any imagination. However the main dishes were huge and I have to give the salad credit for being fresh, but again a bit tasteless and you know, just the basic stuff.It was a fair deal for us but I don't think I would visit the place with full prices - even though it is not even that that expensive, but just knowing that with that money you can get better deal from elsewhere. Sorry Giraffe.",

As we commented at the time, this was one of the few places open at that time on a saturday night for people in that area, so they didn't really have much choice, but even so, they were enjoying the experience, and frankly so did we. The venue doesn't offer the draught Red Stripe option but to be fair the menu says that not every venue does, so I had a glass of diet Coke and my mother had an apple juice. She opted for the half chicken, which was too much for her, and I had the Hot Thai Duck stir fry, which was delicious, with a side order of potato wedges. The prices were very reasonable and the food was much better than the muck we had at the British Library. Would have had a dessert too but the wedges plugged that hole.",

I love their pudding, the apple berry crumble, the banoffee pies, the swiss mountain chocolate cheesecake. I even love their logo, and how sleek and smart that orange giraffe silhouette looks on the staff uniforms. And if you have kids, get them a \"Giddy Giraffe\" smoothie, because it comes with a plastic giraffe stir stick that HAS LEGS. How awesome is that?",

My favorite was the breakfast, though, delicious and very well priced. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was always friendly and helpful. They also seem more than accommodating: there was one day where friends and I were there, not sure if anyone else would join us.

    "text": "The husband is out of town, the babysitter is out of town, and so I am stuck exploring the gastronomic stylings of two young children until Saturday. Help! I've been cooking at home for a couple of days now, and I needed to get out. After watching the kids playing for a while at Coram's Fields, the siren song of Giraffe was too strong, and I decided to check it out.I had been advised/warned about Giraffe before moving to London. My friends with kids said that the food wasn't too bad, and that the children would love it, but not to expect too much. Nonetheless, when I saw that they had Huevos Rancheros on the menu, my Tex-Mex longing went through the \"have some sense!\" meter, and I ordered that for myself. The kids, unshockingly, ordered the crispy chicken strips. (I'm actually selling the kids too short here - they do like a range of food, but everyone opts for comfort food sometime.)In addition to the chips and chicken, the children's dishes also came with some corn, adding a bit of nutritional value, which was nice. Meanwhile, my huevos had, what? what is that? pepperoni? WHAT? (It was actually chorizo, but still.) Rather than rolled on the side, for maximum customization of every bite, the tortilla was splayed flat, with cheese, beans, eggs, and meat on top. If I had ordered the eggs fried rather than scrambled, it would have been very similar to an Florence-style pizza, in fact. Lesson learned - no more Tex-Mex style food at Giraffe for me.That said, as long as I pretended I wasn't eating huevos rancheros, the flavor wasn't that bad, and the ingredients were clearly fresh. They also had tabasco on the table to spice things up a bit. The children loved their food, crayons, plastic giraffes, etc. The service was fast and super-friendly, and the prices were reasonable. For a treat (or a bribe) for the kids in the future, I would probably go here again.",

My American children think the burgers are very good. The menu changes fairly regularly and both the flavorless and the flavorful go their way every few months. If you want a salad that has a lot of interesting bits in it, Giraffe usually offers up something tasty. But every once in a while I'll order something and it is just dull and missing a key flavor or texture. Fish and meat can be overdone, too. Service is generally very nice and the prices are good for central London, but sometimes I feel like I would have done better with something from Waitrose warmed up at home....",

The music was funky and mod, almost as if I was dining in a swanky club. The food was great and actually had spice to it, and I enjoyed the burger, the breakfast menu, and their deserts are well done. The location in Russell Square is great as well, and is surrounded by other sites to see. On the plus side, there is a tube station across the street.",

When my husband (then boyfriend) came to visit me in the UK ended up taking refuge from the harsh winter weather and stopping for a coffee and some breakfast. The coffee was alright, I think once you've had real American drip coffee at even the most run-down establishments you come to realise how weak the UK version is in comparison. But it was coffee, and it warmed us well! He ordered a breakfast burrito, and a side of bacon to curb his hunger, and I stuck with poached eggs, bacon and a round of toast. It was definitely a little on the expensive side for the portion sizes, but it was cooked as well as it could be. It was nothing to write home about, but it filled a hole and we were very grateful for that! The service was pretty poor though, especially as the restaurant was nearly empty, which has been what's brought the overall rating down.It was a shame really as I'd vouched for Giraffe based on some of the tasty Mexican dishes I'd had the pleasure to have previously.",

I am sure the business plan for these places is fine-tuned for profit maximisation in that interval between opening, rollout and the day about two years later when everyone realises the whole thing is a pile o' poo. Tesco has reached that moment. They have sold Giraffe and say their in-store cafes will now meet the need for in-store dining. \u00a0That statement -from the horse's mouth - tells you what you're really getting at a Giraffe.",

The food however I'm still unsure of, the portions are small and it isn't cheap and they seem to sell a selection of different foods.

I also had a glass of mediocre Chilean white wine. I had a bit of work to do and used the free wifi from the Starbucks. The staff was non-pressuring and let me linger a bit while I finished my wine. I probably wouldn't rush back to Giraffe, or any of the other locations. The main reason is that it's quite a popular place for families - I was one of the few people without a kid in tow.

For starter we had the chicken Popsicles or something like that and they were really good! Once finished it took less then 15 min for the main course to arrive which were burgers! The meat itself tasted good but wasn't that amazing ground so you had sometimes a few harder pieces of meat. Another thing which was not that big deal but a bit annoying-there was a lot of rocket salad on the burger which made the burger taste a little bitter.Overall I can say it's worth a visit.
