A \"brisket\" roll was a grey slab of tough beef. The carbonara was thick and gloopy. The red wine suggested at \u00a325 was terrible. Sadly I think you should stick to the breakfast which does get excellent reviews! Swerve the dinner.",

Previously an Asian eaterie, it even has the exterior name of Thai Break crossed out to now Egg Break.What I liked was the fantastic service inside. And they of course did egg dishes very well. I liked the buns with egg and chicken and pork belly best though there were other surprising delights along the way. Even the cocktails were very good. Quite out of the way for me but if I'm in area I will be back for sure.",

So if you fancy some really good eggs yourself, I suggest that you hurry up to egg break because this place is totally cracking ! YUMMYYou have the basics, with avocado, florentine, benedicte, royale, english. Or you can go extra with super softy bun. My heart really hesitated between the fried chicken egg buns and the pork belly fried egg siracha bun.Get yourself some house press to go with your egg. The green house press is my favorite because green goes well with yellow (kale, apple, cucumber, celery and tons of other green stuff). MONEY MONEY MONEYYou won't break your wallet here. Your eggs/buns will cost you less than \u00a310Your house press \u00a34 for small or \u00a37 for a largeWHAT I LIKE - They serve salads, soup, other plates and other if you're not feeling like havings eggs. But keep in mind that the place is called EGG BREAK !- Really cute presentation. - Coffee and dessert are pretty goodHOW TO GO WITH? Your girlfriends for brunch",

    "text": "Egg Break is an adorably quirky little cafe hidden down a little side street near Notting Hill Gate. The space was previously inhabited by a Thai restaurant so they have simply crossed out the word \"Thai\" on the signage and replaced it with \"Egg\". This is a perfect example of the laid back, quirky but cute atmosphere you will find. Upon first entering the restaurant seems tiny however after going down stairs and winding around tiny hallways you are welcomed by a slightly larger dining space. The tables are squished together in a slightly disorganized manner but this only adds to the charm. The menu is short and sweet featuring a variety of dishes featuring (as you probably guessed) eggs! The service was a bit slow but once the food came it was delicious. The avocado toast was beautifully presented and the poached eggs revealed yolks that were insanely yellow and amazing. I will certainly come back to try some of their other brunch dishes and possibly their dinner options as well!",

It is a pretty standard caf\u00e9 that actually reminded me a lot of Two Hands in NYC, in that it's a pretty, instagrammable space dedicated to over-charging willing participants in the act of brunch.I ordered the avo toast, because I am a basic white female with a penchant for basic white female brunch foods. Little did I know, the toast also came with poached eggs on top, which were perhaps the best part of the meal. I can barely cook scrambled eggs for myself, so a runny yolk that won't make me visibly ill is a welcome change. I also had the green juice, as the menu didn't mention their coffee at all, and it was a great complement to my eggs.Though the food and atmosphere were equally impressive, I ultimately left frustrated because of the scattered service. It took quite a while to get our food, and even longer to get the check. Other reviews have said that Egg Break is under new management, though, so I'll be a little forgiving. Hopefully, this will work itself out, and the experience will be of equal quality to the food itself.",

I saw so many pictures about Eggbreak on Instagram, that on my weekend back in London I decided to have breakfast there with my roommate. We knew we would have to queue (especially since it's in Notting Hill) but surprisingly enough, we only had to wait for about 10 minutes, which is not so bad.Surely it's because they have many tables available, on different levels. We ate at a small table at the lower level (with no windows). Sure, you can't enjoy the daylight, but the decoration makes up for it (and the food as well).I had the cornbread waffles with bacon and eggs, ordered a rose green tea, while my roommate had avocado on toast (a fancier version of course). The food was delicious, so so tasty and I really liked it, but I was surprised to be really into the green tea !Most of the time, I'm all about the food, but I have to admit the tea added a really nice touch to this brunch.I would definetely recommend this place, but maybe try to be there early to grab a table near a window ?",

The coffee is decent but all of our food was luke warm. I personally wouldn't come back as the breakfast really wasn't that great. My friend had the waffles which were super dry and my pancakes were pretty naff. I must say though, there was a decent amount of fruit with the pancakes though and the berries were very plump! It looks pretty and they have all the calling cards of 'trendy brunch' with their acme mugs and decorative plates but when it comes down to substance the food just isn't up to scratch.

    "text": "Egg break is recently had a change in management and therefore a new brunch menu was introduced. Missed out on their old menu and sad to never got to try their their hotdog kimchi rice I was still quite eggcited to see what they got on offer being a big lover of breakfast dishes.Their restaurant was more like a cafe, quaint and homely with their long stretch of cushioned seating downstairs accompanied with individual cushions too. Nice house old plants to add some nice natural green to the place against the white tables and walls. They really made used of their place to fit as many tables as possible which made the place quite cramp at times, during the weekends. House stuffed flatbread We fancied something quick to snack on whilst our mehad a very satisfying texture being doughy and chewy. The filling of spinach, feta, cucumber, yogurt and sumac brought in very light healthy flavours as well as adding a lovely contrast in texturesCornbread waffles These were delicious. I loved the how the waffles were already sweetened so we didn't have to drizzle it with syrup. I find it by doing it that way the sweetness is more even across the dish. They were nice and firm yet slightly spongy inside. The bacon was grilled so the edges were crisp, adding a nice contrast of saltiness. Topped nicely with a rich organic free range sunny side up and drizzled with a bit of ketchup to a nice vinegary sweetness.Corn cakes These were my favourite dish of the meal. Presented like eggs florentine it made me realise what a difference it makes to have a different base and something that holds more flavour. They were bouncy, lovely flavours from added vegetables creating lovely textures and flavours. The burst of sweetness from the corn was felt against the velvety spinach and the lovely rich poached eggs. Hollandaise was perfect and creamy wrapping everything up nicelyBacon cheeseburger doubled up Fantastic burger. Shows the drastic improvements of what high quality ingredients can do to a burger. No need for extra garnishes as the medium rare patty was so packed with flavour, sweetness and incredibly meaty and tender. It was as juicy as a good steak! Cheese was rich and creamy and for once I could actually taste it in every bite of the burger. The pineapple bacon jam gave the whole burger a good zest and flavour and all topped nicely with a pillow soft brioche bun. Chips were like McDonald's ones, thin, salty and tasty. The only thing I would question is the bacon in the name as it doesn't have any in it and was probably just preferring to the bacon jam itself.French toastAnd the amazing crunchy dessert. How they managed to achieve such a great contrast of a thin crispy crunchy top toast and a wet spongy inside? I really don't know. But it's amazing especially with a lovely addition of soft ripen bananas to add another type of sweetness to it and blueberries for a little burst of zest to balance it. Drizzled over with maple syrup to make it even more moist and tasty.I absolutely love Egg break. Just a shame that it is not one of those places you can just sit and relax at your own comfort without feeling remorse seeing those queuing up at the door eager to get a seat like you once were. At such a small cramp place, noise levels were pretty high too with music that is way too loud for a little place like this. At least service was fantastic, great at giving suggestions and looked like they were enjoying themselves too. It's always nice to have enthusiastic staff. Anyway I highly recommend this place nevertheless although be aware that the name 'Egg break' is deceiving as not all of their dishes contain egg although most do.",

But I do feel there is room for improvement.I visited for Sunday brunch during the soft launch, during which food was 50% off. I had the smashed avocado on sourdough, with poached eggs. It was lovely - perfectly cooked eggs, not too mushy avocado and a good sized portion. The sourdough was a little on the hard side and it was slightly cold when served. I would order this again.My companion had the bacon cheeseburger which comes with fries. It was a good burger, nicely pink in the middle (it should be noted that the server didn't ask how he would prefer it to be cooked). I wouldn't really call this a bacon cheeseburger though as it has no rashers of bacon, instead the bacon is in the pineapple bacon jam, which still wasn't very bacony.What I wouldn't order again are the fresh fruit juices. They were nice enough, but \u00a34 for the smallest glass of juice I've seen is too much.Service was friendly but slow, although the food was served promptly.I would recommend Eggbreak if you're nearby, but don't go out of your way for it.",

My friend got the sweet potato rosti, which she said was one of the best things she's ever eaten, and a rose latte. Service was friendly and attentive. I highly recommend Egg Break (and I will definitely be back).",

From the moment I stepped into Eggbreak, I knew I'd found it. Not only is the food outstanding in every way (the French toast is the best I've ever had), but the vibe of the place is second to none. It's a cozy place, well-decorated, with great music and a wonderful atmosphere. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Now that I've found it, I don't think anything could keep me away.",

As for the food, it is \u00a0pricey- around \u00a39 for a sweet plate of pancakes or French toast, but the presentation is nice. The poached eggs on corn cakes were my favorite as their hollandaise is quite special from others I've tasted. The business uses sustainable sources for \u00a0their food, and is only a short walk from the tube stop.Overall a good food and day out experience!",

Healthy, indulgent, original and traditional dishes. I went with the fried chicken burger which had the right spice level, pickles and onions. The shoe string fries were tasty. My companion enjoyed her salt beef hash with eggs and bread. Satisfying.The original Bloody Mary was a bit boring. There was no lime or celery, barely any spice. Might need to go for something bolder next time, as they have 4 types to choose from along with coffee, tea, and other cocktails.Overall I enjoyed the meal and would definitely return for breakfast or lunch.",

    "text": "A nice place for brunch! Food was not exceptional, but the ambiance and service made our meal very pleasant and enjoyable. I got the Eggs Benny with smoked salmon, and while the hollandaise was not bad, it didn't leave too much of an impression and the English muffin was too thick which made it hard to eat everything together. Eggs were done very well (as the name suggests), and this echoed for my friends Mexican Omelette as well which was delicious and flavourful. Would go again, but mindful that drink prices are a bit expensive.",

    "text": "Egg Break is what it looks like: a brunch caf\u00e9 targeting youths with Instagram accounts who put avocado on everything (i.e. me). \u00a0The interior has a pleasant trendiness to it, the food is well plated, and ordering tea gets you milk in this really cute mini milk bottle. \u00a0The ground floor seating is just as nice, open, and airy as the first floor, so don't walk away just because there are no tables available upstairs. \u00a0The portion sizes are strangely varied (my chia pudding was tiny, but my friend's avocado toast was enormous). \u00a0My favorite thing I tried was the green juice; sharp and tangy, it pairs surprisingly well with breakfast.This is very clearly a new cafe, and the management still has some kinks to smooth out. \u00a0The food itself was decent enough, but the service seems a bit haphazard. \u00a0We were served (slowly) by three different waitresses in an hour. \u00a0The menu was also oddly incomplete; it says not a word about coffee and only after trying to order a specialty tea they were out of did I find out they serve regular Yorkshire tea. \u00a0I hope to come back in a few years time to find that the experience has reached the standard of the food.",

Crab cake w siracha was fabulous! \u00a0 Just the right amount of spicy. \u00a0Coffee was good but I wish they would have refilled it at least once. \u00a0 \u00a0Never happened - probably too busy. \u00a0Mostly a 5 star place but when the rock music started at 11 am -- I lost my appetite and the soft welcoming vibe was lost. \u00a0Recommend an early start -- becomes more touristy around lunch.",

The Turkish dish had a bit too much dill and yogurt, but I think that's a matter of preference. We were skeptical about the pancakes because they have caramel on top, but the pancakes were so good! The waiters were attentive despite being very busy.",
