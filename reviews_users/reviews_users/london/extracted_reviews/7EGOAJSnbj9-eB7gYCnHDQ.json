    "text": "\"Asakusa\" is basically the closest place to a real Japanese tradional restaurant you could find in London. Period. I know what I'm saying because I spent a month in Japan and visited dozens of bars and restaurants. Forget the elegant and fashionable western-style Japanese restaurant: here you'll find the authentic japanese food, place and feeling. The menu is written both in Japanese and English (unfortunately it seems like most of the courses are only written in Japanese, though) and you will find almost every dish your mouth could taste in Tokyo or Kyoto. They have a large selection of sushi and sashimi but in my opinion the great value of Asakusa is that it shows that Japanese cuisine is not only raw fish and rice. On the contrary, everyone who spent some time in the land of the rising sun will tell you that sushi and sashimi rarely find their place on the everyday meal. You can then choose between udon, soba, yakitori, tempura and a lot of other delicacies you'll hardly find at this price. Obviously you can also choose between a large range of Japanese beers, traditional sake and shochu (Japanese wine) as well. There's also a set menu that will help them who are not very familiar with the Japanese cuisine. By choosing one of the sets (bento) you will discover the deliciousness and richness of Japanese food and spend a ridicolously small amount of money, sometimes even less than 10\u00a3! For the vegetarian customers who think Japanese food is only about fish: come here and discover how many wonderful dishes without meat or fish you can find. There's also a \"yasai bento\" (veggie menu) which is very cheap and will not leave you hungry. The only downside: it's always full booked, and for a reason. Call and book your table as soon as you can and, believe me, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm going to be a bit critical since I was expecting so much, but I definitely was underwhelmed after my visit to Asakusa. I already knew that the interior and ambience was going to be lacking, but the tables are completely squished together, and it didn't help that the table next to mine had two women conversely in Mandarin loudly and burping. I digress, so now on to the food.I definitely think that the highlights on the menu here are the cooked dishes. I ordered the braised pork belly (it was a bit overcooked and very stringy- the dish is similar to a Vietnamese one I always make so it's possible to braise pork belly without making it so dry), the eggplant ( which was nice just maybe slathered with a tad bit of too much sauce), the fried oysters (delicious but not something to write home about), the spicy squid, prawn tempura, and the ika tempura (the batter on this batch was way too thick). I also ordered the agedashi tofu which was delicious, as was the soft-shell crab. I ordered the maguro, hamachi and sake sashimi. Hamachi and safe were delicious, but as usual the maguro was very stringy, although this seems to be a very frequent occurrence in the UK. No toro? I'm a bit disappointed- guess I'll go to Sake no hana for that. The rolls are definitely a waste of time and money.All in all, the prices are very reasonable, I felt like my boyfriend had to roll me home. We spent \u00a373 in total (but that's without wine/ beer)- yes, we eat A LOT. Despite my food coma, I didn't feel completely satisfied and that I wanted/ expected a little something more. I would probably give Asakusa another try, but I wouldn't call it my new sushi bar home.",

I can also ignore the fact that if you seat me downstairs, you keep me away from the magic of the sushi bar and give me a somewhat musty toilet smell to compete with. And why don't these things matter? Because you serve me the best Japanese food in London, for the least amount of money, and the least pretention, yet with the most authenticity!Thinking of my meal there last week, I can't help but crave you again. DIVINE aubergine with miso paste for starter, along with miso and crab soup; a crunchy golden tempura kit with succulent prawns, mixed veg and plenty of dipping sauce (could be stronger in flavour) with sticky rice; eel in a very, very 'special sauce'; followed by a huge salmon and avocado tamaki and teeny tiny tuna rolls. OH, and the wasabi and pickles - you give me more than I need. After all of this, and washed down with two (yes, two) bottles of Sake, two of us pay a total of 55 quid with service.sigh",

    "text": "Asakusa is a traditional, authentic, family-run Japanese restaurant lying on the quiet side of Mornington Crescent station. Mind you, this concealment from the hordes of Camden-goers is largely immaterial, given the ageing, drab facade of the restaurant's exterior, and by the very fact that it is invariably busy, chock-full of Japanese, locals, and food-lovers in the know. Phone up to book and you'll be greeted with ??? (Asakusa resutoranto desu!), likely followed shortly by I'm afraid we already have a lot of bookings tonight, such is the demand for this little piece of Tokyo removed. Open only in the evening, six days a week (and closed for holidays \u00a0national and family) there is generally space for those able to arrive soon after opening (around 6pm), and of course you can book days in advance for certain availability. The restaurant consists of three small areas: The main dining area hosts the fortunate guests, and near the kitchen there is a sushi bar, behind which the sushi chef (sometimes assisted by an extra pair of hands) is worked non-stop in order to satisfy the throng's substantial appetite. The modest decor of warm colours and dark wood make for a cosy environment, the walls adorned with posters advertising Asahi lager, oriental bric-a-brac, and most prominently, menu items written exclusively in Japanese. Thankfully, those not appearing on the standard menu have recently been translated onto an extra sheet for the more adventurous (chicken gizzard skewers anyone?). Operations are managed from inside a curious brightly-lit 'hut' with quaint clay roof-tiling, adding charm to a simple layout. You may however find yourself situated downstairs, alongside an antiquated (and thankfully inactive) tape karaoke system. More canteen-like in appearance, oft cold and suspiciously damp, there you'll have to trust that the food will take your mind off the surroundings. And herein lies the draw \u00a0traditional, simple cuisine done extremely well. You won't find cutting-edge culinary flare, but choose wisely and you'll wonder if the world of oriental food really needs any more than that with which it is already endowed. Meat is prepared beautifully, sauces are bold and flavoursome, and dished are well portioned, allowing you to balance your meal with an array of sides (one good reason to make it a social visit). A standard set dish of beef teriyaki or chicken shogayaki and some sushi is a perfectly tasty way to fill your stomach, but why not try their buta kakuni (simmered belly-pork in a special sauce) with rice, nasu dengaku (deep-fried aubergine topped with a sweet miso paste), and tem zaru soba (assorted tempura with cold noodles and a dipping sauce)? If you're not sharing then you're answer will probably be Because I cannot leave without having some of their excellent sushi!, and few people would argue with that. If you fancy an interesting collective experience try ordering a hot-pot (say a sukiyaki or the Asakusa special) and huddle around the burner, though for this you may need to order in advance. Now comes the bit you really didn't expect. This food comes at prices that are more fitting of Misato than Mitsukoshi, and remember the green tea is free! The Japanese waitresses are always polite, if sometimes run off their feet, and at peak times you can expect to wait a while for sushi orders while the chef clears the backlog. Still, all things considered, is there any wonder?",

    "text": "Having eaten here several times now, I hate to say it but the quality (at least when I've visited) has been really variable. The cooked dishes are delicious and highly recommended (especially the squid), the staff are friendly and helpful and the prices very reasonable. I'd recommend asking to sit at the sushi bar if there's space available as well. It's always tricky getting in without booking unless you visit after about 9.30/10pm, but that says a lot about how popular this place is. The first time I visited I absolutely loved it. Since then, however, my one (big) criticism has been the sushi - the last time I visited I ordered maki rolls and ended up with stale rice and nori that failed to keep the sushi together and led to it falling apart when picked up. The cucumber in my cucumber maki tasted off as well. Maybe it's just that I've visited fairly late once or twice and the chef is using up the last of the day's ingredients, but I'm of the opinion that if your rice, nori and main ingredients are off then it's better to inform the customer that you can't meet the order than it is to provide them with something verging on being inedible.",

Since the food was what the over hype was about we decided to taste the overall quality of the ingredients that they were using and so we ordered several sashimi's and sushi's, the food was good and the quality of the ingredients did excel however I did feel that I've tasted far better for half the price at numerous Japanese restaurants throughout London area.The number reason to why I decided to write this review was due to their sheer rudeness in service, the staff seemed really fake and did not treat us like customers and so at the end of the meal we asked for the service charge to be removed only to be asked if they done anything wrong. We were then given a disapproved look as we walked out of the building.To sum it up, there are far better restaurants in London and especially with most of the reviews of the restaurant being from several years you have to question yourself to trust a review that has aged as much as this restaurant.I wont be visiting again.",

The variety of food on offer is excellent, from full blown sashimi sets to individual yakitori portions. Even the sole vegetarian in our party was well catered for, with delicious roast aubergine and vegetable tempura, as well as her share in the free-for-all endamame beans. The remaining carnivores were treated to an array of ox-tongue, chicken wings, tuna, mackerel and scallop sashimi, and delicious skewers of chicken yakitori. The sashimi was exceptionally fresh, the tuna succulent and flavoursome, the best I've had in London. All this was washed down with Sapporo Ichiban lager, as well as green tea. The service was brilliant, despite a packed house of mainly japanese diners. The atmosphere too was great, the regulars obviously have worked up a rapport with the staff and good-natured banter added to the feeling that Asakusa is special. One caveat is that the place, as I've said, is popular. So it's well worth booking in advance, preferably a day or so before. Saying this, if you don't mind eating late, after 9pm, then there's a good chance you can just walk in.",

This is traditional Japanese cuisine - good value for money and good portion sizes raher than focus onn presentation like in some more expensive restaurants. The only negatives are that it is always very cramped and the decor is very dated.

This is a great place that is a little different but well worth the time of searching out if you would like to try traditional Japanese food.

I'm Japanese, and I can vouch for the authenticity of the food, and it's good, real Japanese food. This place gets filled really fast which proves it's good food- but I felt the wait staff was not very friendly and the service was below my expectations, which is why I decked one star. The other 0.5 star is because I felt it was a bit overpriced for the stuff that's on the menu. I know London has high standards of living - but for knowing that I could make almost everything that was on the home-cooked traditional food on the menu- it felt a bit ridiculous to be shelling pound after pound for something that simple.That said , their traditional home food was really good - and I would recommend it to anyone. \u00a0I'm sure their sushi is good too- but I heard Asakusa is good for their home traditional food, which is why I ate mostly that.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm going to be a bit critical since I was expecting so much, but I definitely was underwhelmed after my visit to Asakusa. I already knew that the interior and ambience was going to be lacking, but the tables are completely squished together, and it didn't help that the table next to mine had two women conversely in Mandarin loudly and burping. I digress, so now on to the food.I definitely think that the highlights on the menu here are the cooked dishes. I ordered the braised pork belly (it was a bit overcooked and very stringy- the dish is similar to a Vietnamese one I always make so it's possible to braise pork belly without making it so dry), the eggplant ( which was nice just maybe slathered with a tad bit of too much sauce), the fried oysters (delicious but not something to write home about), the spicy squid, prawn tempura, and the ika tempura (the batter on this batch was way too thick). I also ordered the agedashi tofu which was delicious, as was the soft-shell crab. I ordered the maguro, hamachi and sake sashimi. Hamachi and safe were delicious, but as usual the maguro was very stringy, although this seems to be a very frequent occurrence in the UK. No toro? I'm a bit disappointed- guess I'll go to Sake no hana for that. The rolls are definitely a waste of time and money. All in all, the prices are very reasonable, I felt like my boyfriend had to roll me home. We spent \u00a373 in total (but that's without wine/ beer)- yes, we eat A LOT. Despite my food coma, I didn't feel completely satisfied and that I wanted/ expected a little something more. I would probably give Asakusa another try, but I wouldn't call it my new sushi bar home.",

We just managed to get a table on a Saturday before the restaurant closed its kitchen for the night (around 10pm) so were grateful that they let us in at all! We were heading for Koko but thought we should first line our stomachs with some food and randomly stumbled upon Asakusa (literally across the road from Koko) - which I thought was the least likely place I'd put a Japanese restaurant in, but hey, I'm grateful for it as I work in Camden Town!Anyway, I'd imagine reservations is a must if you plan on eating dinner at normal hours.The restaurant is split over two floors - the ground and a basement floor. Its pretty cramped but in true Asian style, they've taken advantage of ALL available space. That said, the food here is something else! Since coming to London from Sydney (where Jap food is of such a high quality you almost don't feel the need to go to Japan), I've not be much impressed with the quality I've tried to date. Asakusa totally restored my faith in finding good Jap food in London! Can't remember everything we ordered but did recall their cold soba being amazing, unagi and softshell crab nigiris were divine and the yakitori was decent too. We didn't really get a chance to order much as they were closing in an hour anyway, but I'm certainly planning on coming back here time and again until I've made my way through their generous menu!",

Whether you're going there for a group meal or for a more intimate dinner, the food is brilliant, there's always a buzz and the service is great.My absolute favourite is Nasu Dengaku which is fried aubergine and soya paste. Totally yum. In fact, I can't think of a dish I don't like. Whether you're in for the more safer dishes such as teriyaki or tempura or whether you're more adventurous with your food, all of it is presented decently and tastes great. Did I mention the value? All dishes are reasonably priced which means you can leave feeling stuffed and without an anorexic wallet. It's about 10 minutes walk from Camden Tube, and less than a minute (if you walk as fast as I do when I'm anticipating food...) from Mornington Crescent. I'd advise to book if you've got a large group. Unfortunately, they don't open at lunch else I'd be there everyday.",

I've heard everything from \"this is a secret place near camden\" to \"It has the best sushi in London but I'm not teling you where\". Needless to say these are people I no longer consider to be friends. That aside I can see why they wanted to guard the place slightly. OK visually its very basic and the decor isn't super plush but that is something I liked about the place. I like it when a place is all about the food and last night it was definitely having a good night in terms of food. I had a sushi set and a beer. Very simple dinner but everything was lovely. The fish was of excellent quality and was cut so well it melted on the tongue. The Wasabi was especially firey too which was great for clearing my nose! My denim doppleganger had the same as me and we were both very happy. The sushi set came with types of nigiri and 2 maki rolls and a serving of miso soup. Was nice and light and just the right amount of food given that I am on a diet at the moment. I found the prices there very reasonable and I definitely want to go back to explore the menu further.",

I've tried coming here before only to be told that they are fully booked for the whole evening. This time I made a reservation and saw others being turned away. Remember to book a table, it's absolutely necessary. First off I should probably say that if you're into sushi (made by a proper chef, not the high street chain kind) then you definitely need to go here. This could very well be one of the best places for sushi in London, especially considering the price. The fish is really fresh and just melts in your mouth, served with just enough wasabi on still warm sushi rice. Would be a shame if it ended there but actually the hot dishes are just as good as the sushi. The takoyaki and Wafu beef were highlights (couldn't try all dishes even though I wanted to, I'm sure there are a lot more highlights on the menu). The squid with Ginger sauce was good as well, nice to have good quality and well cooked squid for once an not the chewing gum consistency kind, but was overshadowed by the other dishes. Desserts were good as well, I tried the black sesame and green tea ice creams, both of which were nice. I find it a bit hard though being excited about the dessert compared to the starters, main and sushi. Will have to go back soon to try the oter dishes.",

We even ordered a few \"surprises\" like stuffed aubergines which proved deliciousAsakusa's slightly dated decor adds character and authenticity to the small restaurant and the staff were extremely friendly.

I spent a significant amount of my childhood in Tokyo and while this place does not feel like Japanese sushi joints, it does serve just as much fresh fish! We ordered the gyoza which was delicious. We ordered three roles between the three of two of us but I cannot for the life of me remember which ones they were. I wish we had ordered some noodles or soup because the folks next to us did and it looked AMAZING! I absolutely was drooling over their meal while waiting for mine. Compared to the rest of the places in London, this was not a bad deal. I believe we spent about 40 pounds on the whole meal, which was not bad for such a popular spot. Overall, would totally recommend this place if you are craving some Asian food in the midst of all the shepherd pies, donuts and steaks!",

I must say that the menu here is pretty inundating as it seem to keep going on and on, hence the amount of food we ordered. Overall, wonderful find in London.",

I warn you that its not a good method cause it backfires sometimes :) Thats a problem when you're with a hangry wife!!Hangry = Hungry + Angry.BUT when it works and you end up at a cool hole in the wall, authentic, Japanese restaurant its a lot of fun. And its exactly why i love Yelp!We loved everything, I say everything because I have to admit Japanese is not my strongest cuisine! I usually ask my wife to order and so far that has worked for me :)Because its a review I should try at least to find the things we ordered on the menu for you. OK I tried and failed! but here's what I remember :) We ordered an assortment of sushi which I know contained eel which I loved. We also had the vegetables dumplings, and the tampora mix.",

Don't let the shabby exterior fool you, this place is the real thing.So what if you can't read the food offerings in Japanese on the walls, there is plenty on this very varied menu to choose from. So what if the sushi takes ages to arrive and the food your table has ordered comes out at all different times....it makes it feel more like a family run place. Sit back and enjoy. They have an excellent sake selection as well.Tips:1. Make a reservation. It gets crowded quite quickly, even on what you might think would be a 'quiet night'.2. Order sushi early...if you are eating/order after 18.30 you will have to wait 30 minutes or more for your sushi. \u00a0If you are pressed for time get one of the hot dishes. My favorite is the salmon with soy glaze -- \u00a0the portion is huge.Now pick up a big ol' piece of pickled ginger and dig in.",

This time, my fiancee booked well in advance, and we found ourselves with a table there on a Saturday night! Inside, it definitely looks like you could have stepped in a local Japanese noodlehouse. There's menus in Japanese on the walls, and the place is humbly furnished. The food is definitely the highlight. Its not fine dining, nor is it extremely cheap, but the quality and authenticity of the food makes it so that its probably one of the best without having to pay fine dining prices. For \u00a340, the two of us managed to get an extremely filling meal! Definitely recommended is the sashimi, which is extremely fresh and well prepared. The quail's egg and the gyozas were pretty good too, although the takoyaki balls were a bit disappointing. A highlight was the Asakusa Udon, which had a surprising mochi rice cake in it!!!

We were put in the basement which smells like toilets and we asked to get a table upstairs instead. We waited an extra half hour so we could sit upstairs. When we finally were sat down, the server took our order and gave us half of what we asked for. We waited 45 mins for enough sushi for 3 people and there were 4 of us. We left having enjoyed the sushi but still feeling hungry because it was too late to order more. I don't think the bad service was intentional, but I think something was lost in translation. I would still return here because the quality of the sushi really is delicious but I'm less enthusiastic than before.",

It's a nice place to chill, and have drinks. Enough seats for couples, groups and families. I wouldn't say it's kids friendly cause it feels like a place where adults come in to let go some steam after a long day (maybe it's because I'm here at almost 11pm). Also no space to park a stroller. I'm going to come back here to chill DF out lol",

All dishes were good. I paid under \u00a355 for all of this, including 2 glasses of wine and soft drinks. The service is really good, the staff are very friendly.But I have to add.. This isn't the best tasting Japanese food in London, none of the dishes wowed me, that's why I haven't given 5 stars. It is worthy of a visit though, as the food is so cheap and the experience and atmosphere are on-point. Thanks Asakusa!",

On walking in I was like \"Ohh ok this ain't to bad\" but then I realised there was nowhere to sit so they took us down stairs to where the over flow of customers go. Anyway first impressions of the downstairs was a bad smell, like a mixture of damp and cats piss... Also very old fashion decor and just dusty looking crap all over the place, it looked like it had not been painted or touched in over 30 years. The smell was really putting me off, I remember saying to my girlfriend that if the sitting Area ain't clean and it's stinky what's the kitchen like . Anyway long story short... The food was real good and the service just as good. But don't think I would go back as there is just as good \"imo\" Japanese restaurants \"that don't smell like cats piss or look like they're from the 70s\" near by. Bottom line is this place is always packed so it must be good, but me personally don't like a Stale stench while eating. Would have got a 4 if not for the smell and dirty looking decor. \u00a0But as I said the food was great.",

We were surrounded by incredibly rowdy customers who were shouting and screaming in a basement of a dirty and outdated restaurant with terrible decor. The toilet was filthy and there was only one for a man and a woman. So be prepared to queue.When we went to order after spending half an hour trying to get the attention of our waitress she informed us that the sushi would take an hour so being a little crushed as that's why we came here we chose other foods. It took an hour and a half for the food we did order. So basically we should have gotten the sushi as it would have been faster. What we got was a small portion of what could be described as chicken I guess and a small portion of pork. Took another hour almost to get one portion of ice cream and a bill. Never again.",

The hamburg steak was a bit on the dry side, and I've had better sake sashimi at Eat Tokyo for a lower price.What was unbearable was the service. It took a solid 30 minutes for me to see any food at all. The person sitting next to me at the bar was quoted 50 minutes, and he sat there with no food until I was done eating.Then, to top it off, they took forever to give me the bill. I had to flag down three different waitresses before I could pay them. Then a week later, I realize that they charged me twice on my card. I'm going to drop by tomorrow or something to get it refunded - but how annoying!I was really excited to find a very highly rated sushi place a 5 minute walk from my place, but it was a disappointment.",

Even when you sit down you can smell something from the stairs oozing into your nostrils which makes a bad meal even more disgusting. The service is awful and when I say awful I'm saying a complete joke. You might as well have just made yourself or paid a ten year old to help. Everything is dirty and outdated, it's really beyond me why this place remains open. If you like your stomach stay away, if you like your toilet come check it out.",

    "text": "SO you like Japanese food and want to have a taste of what a good isakaya is without travelling 13 hours to go to Japan???? Then you on the spot \u00a0.... Asakusa is the place to be.The menus are both in English and Japanese and the staff are able to speak both languages. The felling i can tell is that you are actually in Japan. Now on the subject that matters ... Food....... Simply said aweeeeeeesome. There is a variety of small dishes you can choose most of them very typical for a Isakaya restaurant along with the normal selection of Sushi. But if you want to follow my advice skip the sushi and eat all the rest. Additionally you can quince your thirst with real Japanese sake and beer. Skip the wine section as its not so great ( you are after all in a Japanese restaurant and Japan one thing they are not known for is wine)The only reasonthat i am giving them 4 starts instead of 5 (and believe i had to really contemplate on that) is the booking procedure they have. Although you might be lucky to find something if just walk in when you try to book on the phone they seem to be a bit rude whether you do it in Japanese or English. So i will keep visiting and hope they will fix that ... that 5 star review is just around the corner",

I don't understand why they need to put so much salt on everything.Asakusa udon: just ok. Their definition of vegetables on the menu is seaweed only. The mochi was weird and eel did not taste so great. Only good thing were the soft chewy noodles.Salmon sake sashimi: ok. Tough to eat and I've definitely had better.Tuna avocado roll: this was the best thing ordered and was actually really good. Expensive and a huge disappointment.

At that time I had only lived in Japan for about 6 months...and I was used to eating my host mother's amazing cooking...so after i moved to London, I really missed unpretentious, decent Japanese grub. Back then, Asakusa came to the rescue! It has always been cheap, but incredibly tasty. I also love that the menu is written all over the walls, so I could practice kanji while eating out - that sort of counts as studying!!Anyway... now I've yo-yoed between London and Kansai all of my adult life, if it always good to go back to the awesome places from my student years and find that they are still tasty, reasonably priced and just as dodgy-looking as ever!**I should probably mention that my Japanese boyfriend left me broken hearted yeeears ago, but Asakusa has never let me down...and even helped me seduce my lovely current man. *Starts to drool thinking of both...*",

    "text": "Asakusa. It's been on my main list of places to visit for some time. I took a friend who was over from LA. Now, if you've been to LA you know that they get very good Asian food. Korea, Thai, Vietnamese and of course Japanese (esp raw fish). I took her there knowing that Asakusa was highly rated by locals. I was lucky enough to get a last minute booking very early in the evening. 6pm when it opened to be precise. It looks very lacklustre from outside. Bit old hat you might say. And inside it's no different really. But, and eventhough I have an eye for decor and design, when it comes to eating out, it's all about the food for me. Anything else is a bonus. I ordered for us, being the OCD person that I am, scanning reviews the night before and knowing what to get. The baked aubergine is sweet and large. Good to share. And best to have with a starch or protein as on it's own it would be too sickly. I had to get prawn tempura. Which was very fresh and light. A winner for me. The Karaage chicken was good, but not the best I've had in London. It was not oily at all. But that's where I was kinda disappointed as it almost looked too healthy. No glistening. It was a big portion of 4 pieces on the bone. But I do prefer my karaage (like Korean Fried Chicken) boneless. Onto the fish...the black cod is something I read to be a certainty to order and I really liked it. Sweet undertones on the the cod it was good. The horse mackerel was not in, but the server kindly explained there is not much difference! So mackerel nigiri it was. I love mackerel. One of my fav fishes and this was good. The spicy tuna rolls were more coarse than some you might find but this did not detract from the dish. Very good maki rolls.So all in all it was good. Not great but good. But this was my first visit and I'll be back for another try for sure. And the service was lovely and attentive. They even got me Japanese Mayo for my Karaage chicken when I asked for some. So good work. A solid 7/10.",

Why can't people get things right?There were five of us here, and we had a reservation, but we were seated downstairs. I mean it's nice that they have a downstairs room, but it smells awful getting to it (because of the toilets). I can't help but wonder if the terrible service had to do with us being seated downstairs, but whatever.We ordered a lot of food. And all of it was good. Sashimi? Delicious. Sushi? Tasty. Skewers of various types of chicken offal? Really amazing. Tonkatsu? Awesome. Tempura? Great. It just took forever. It's like the kitchen staff don't know how to organize themselves to cook things in a timely manner. Weird. You know what else took ages? Getting our saki. The first batch of saki we ordered? Took FOREVER to arrive. You know what else took ages? Getting a server's attention so we could order more saki. You know what took even longer? Getting the servers to refill our water when we repeatedly asked them to do it. We also tried to order a bit more sushi at the end. Like I've done at every other sushi restaurant I've ever been to anywhere ever. And it was going to take 30 minutes. Not cool guys, not cool.I guess when they know people will keep going to a restaurant because the food is good, they can be horrible servers. However, I think that a place with good food isn't worth going to if you have to deal with service like that. So I won't be returning even though the food was some of the best Japanese I've had in London.",

I mean, you could literally die of hunger in this place. \u00a0The main issue is there is only one sushi chef in a tiny bar to make all of the cold dishes. Combine that with the fact he is probably the slowest sushi chef I have ever witnessed means like me you will probably still feel hungry after being in the restaurant for 2 hours!!!!!! Too bad given that the dishes that do come out are good! If you're there as a group and don't mind drinking between snacks then it's a winner but don't go unless you have a 2-3 hours to kill.",

Then the sushi and sashimi came after a very long wait and by that time we weren't so hungry after the hot food! :( The sushi was mediocre, the sashimi was a lot better but their was something wrong with the tuna as it was a bit stringy.
