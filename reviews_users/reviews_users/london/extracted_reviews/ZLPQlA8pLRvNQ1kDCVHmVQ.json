The pizzas may not be the best in town, but they are better than average, reasonably priced and executed with some flair and originality. There are also some quirky little gems on the menu that lift everything else, for example the cauliflower cheese is great!",

    "text": "Pizza East holds the rare distinction of being the worst Italian restaurant, and one of the worst restaurants, I've ever eaten in. Quick service to the bar was welcome, but once there you're more likely to be on the receiving end of the waiter's enthusiastic shouting than any service. A glass of the Proseco was \u00a38, flat, and tasted more like suds than wine. I ordered the Chicken cacciatore and some olives to have with the Proseco. The Chicken arrived first, despite asking for it after the olives, but no matter. Mild for the rubbish-ness to come. The chicken tasted like it was reheated, the capsicum was as bland as bark, and the bacon was obviously out of a shrink-wrapped packet. Halfway through and unable to finish something that was less palatable than what I could have cooked after several months stranded in the outback, the olives arrived. Dry, chewy, and overly salted I'm starting to doubt whether they were actually olives. Judging that this dodgy, overpriced food was the best I was going to get, and that wine was for some bizarre reason on tap instead of poured, I decided to leave. By the time the waiter asked if there was anything wrong, my hearty yeses ignored, it became clear this is standard operating procedure at Pizza East. Save your money, go somewhere, anywhere else, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Pizza on the Move in Farringdon, Adagio in Soho, Pizza East, a second branch of Franco Manca, and now word has it Ramsay wants to turn part of the York & Albany into a pizzeria. The newest craze in London is pizza. Who'd have thought. The concept is pretty well established, one would think, but perhaps it's similar to those fashion fads: someone also thought those shoulder pads should make a comeback, and suddenly you see them crop up everywhere and anywhere. Now fortunately, pizza is an idea a lot more sensible than shoulder pads. I'm not a huge fan, not even of pizzas, that is. Still, one has to try.The room is large. Decor is rustic. Music is funky. Waiting staff is Shoreditch-bred. There's a silver MacBook on the reception desk, but it was clearly not switched on. All a bit poser-hipster then?No matter. You go for the pizza, unless you don't particularly like pizza, like myself. I had one, nevertheless. Anchovies, capers, olives, on the usual concoction of pomodoro e mozzarella. The pizza base was very semolina-y. Not bad. Quite satisfying. Nothing to rave about, though. Olives with almonds to nibble are nice; very grassy-tasting olives. Quite large, too.I will return. With a bunch of friends, people in a good mood, happy to be loud and chatty and raucous, and we shall drink copious amounts of Valpolicella or Montepulciano. That way, no one will pay all that much attention to their food. And I think that's the point of pizza.",

The interior is very Shoreditch, being a converted warehouse with nice lighting and a large bar area. They have a selection of draught beer as well as wine by the glass or bottle. The pizzas only have two toppings, plus cheese. It's certainly more of the \"gourmet\" ingredients, so don't expect a ham and pineapple. The dough used for the pizzas was different, like flakey pastry rather than the usual wood fired pizza base. The restaurant was busy when I went, but service was adequate. Nothing outstanding, but no faults either.",

We liked the stripped down warehouse space and decor, the banquettes and tables were stylish and in the afternoon it was well lit in a great location and we got a seat by the window to watch the world passing by. My dining companion was hungover and struggled with her crayfish and samphire Pizza - which was to my benfit as I thought it was very tasty and preferred it to the San Daniele ham, tomato, ricotta, pesto, baby chard that I had. Some others have criticised the Pizza but I liked it, a slightly chewy base and decent toppings. We didn't have starters - which is a shame because that's what people seem to be raving about. However I can recommend the Bloody Mary as a spicy tonic. I wouldn't make a special effort to come back here but then it's location is pretty handy so I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up here again. I didn't realise this place was owed by the same guy as Shoreditch House but it is the same building so I guess that makes sense..",

Too many try hard's from around the Shoreditch/Hoxton area. In fact one twenty something asked us to keep the noise down, little oik!!!! We shared some starters calamari was tough, and can't even remember what else we ordered. However the Pizza was pretty good although expensive for what you get.

The only real difference was that there were many more longer tables to squeeze people together. We also feared that there would be more of a yuppie/hipster vibe and, although that was partly true, it did not intrude upon our overall experience.The pizza was the freshest and probably best baked in London. Wines can come from the \"tap\". Don't expect wine glasses for the wines though. Instead, they come in very rustic glasses. Just enjoy the semi-club, semi-lounge, industrial, minimalist restaurant atmosphere! I would have preferred being sat at a table (as opposed to the bar) but I think they were very booked and only had tables for large groups that night. My friend's pasta dish was a touch too oily but otherwise was enjoyed.Service was professional and non-intrusive.Good food. Slightly more expensive than what you pay for (I am still waiting for cheaper and yet hip pizza places) but I couldn't ask for more at the moment.",

The interior certainly lives up to the Shoreditch loft-style spaces. It does seem like an environment that could easily suck you in so you can see and be seen. In fact, I like the place visually. Sadly, the food didnt taste as good as the place looks. We ordered some olives and almonds to start, which were tasty with a hint of citrus. I debated between two pizza choices, and my date took my first choice (the spicy sausage and sprouting broccoli) and so I got my second choice (artichoke and pancetta). They both looked like nice pizzas, but I was disappointed with mine. It was a sauceless pizza, so it was just bland bland bland. Even with a dousing of chili oil, I still wasnt excited and my tastebuds were bored after 1/3 was eaten. The spicy sausage pizza was much better, which reminds me to go with my gut in the future. It still lacked sauce and that acid I like from tomatoes, but if I ever return, that's what I'll get. I wish I had better words to say... but I dont. Go for a glass of wine and olives and some people watching, but eat somewhere else.",

Gorgeous place, sad and tough pizza :( Its in the Tea Building (home to Shoreditch House and next to Albion at the Boundary Project) and only 10 minutes walk from Liverpool Street but somehow, a block past Bishopsgate, haircuts get choppier, clothes get funkier and the City is left behind. Inside it looks great - all East-end warehouse with stone floors, chrome and exposed pipes; people laughing; and happy smiley service. And beers at lunchtime \u00a0yey. For starters, we had tomato bruschetta and marinated olives with almonds. The olives were yummy but the bread on the bruschetta was toasted within about an inch of its life and too hard to eat. Boo. Then the pizza. Pizza East has had great reviews from other food bloggers and I was excited to try it, but sadly I was disappointed. I had the spinach, goat's cheese, tomato and pine nut pizza (the best pizza I've ever had in my life was melt-in-the-mouth gorgonzola and spinach) but it was dry with not enough cheese and too much crust which was so hard my fingers got sore trying to cut it. I prefer a softer chewier base, a la Pizza Express which I have a food crush on. El G's potato, garlic, rosemary, fontina and parmesan pizza looked better but wasn't remarkable and probably had too much cheese. For 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 beers it was \u00a318 each \u00a0not bad. I thought the venue and atmosphere were great - I want to check it out for after-work drinks at the bar and live music at the basement club Concrete. I also don't think all those great reviews can be wrong so it may just be I had a dud pizza \u00a0and I've heard good things about the spicy sausage and broccoli pizza so I'm not giving up yet!",

I'm not sure I see the point of this place anymore and after the hype dies down, if they don't improve customer service they will fail. I was flabbergasted by the utter disregard with which I was recently treated. It's a beautiful space and the menu has some definite highlights, but c'mon don't treat your patrons like doormats! PREVIOUS REVIEW:Very good but doesn't live up to the hype. It's a bit 'style over substance' but that doesn't mean it's lacking substance, just that it's an especially stylish place. The white pizzas are better than the ones with tomato sauce (as their sauce is just too sweet). The starters I tried (roast bone marrow and polenta with chicken livers) are awesome.

Most of it is filled with regular tables, but there's also one massive table and also a counter where people sit and eat.

Choice of pork belly, roast rib of beef or chicken. I had the roast pork belly. The portion was huge. Pork was excellent with very crisp crackling and fennel flavour. Crispy roast potatoes, carrots, fennel, shallots and a jug of perfect gravy that tasted like the real deal (root veg, wine, deglazed meat juices Mmmm) and apple sauce. A side of sprouting brocoli was a perfect green accompaniment. No room for desert after that.Service is friendly, on the ball but laid back and unobtrusive...a sense that someone is running a smoothly run machine.Get there early for Sunday brunch / lunch. At 12:30 it was quite empty. By 2pm it was packed with crowds waiting but there was no sense of being rushed at all. Plus points for that.",

The bartender made me an amazing mojito and we devoured a cheese/prosciutto plate in approximately five seconds, which was good because the table was actually ready far sooner than estimated. The burrata was soo creamy and delicious, and the prosciutto was perfection. Upon being seated and reviewing the menu I was taken by the veal meatball, prosciutto and cream pizza (you can never have too much prosciutto!) and my friend suggested we order some broccoli to be healthy, to which I rolled my eyes but acquiesced. The food was delivered within 10 minutes which was fantastic. Now let me tell you, this is probably the first broccoli I've ever enjoyed in my life (that wasn't smothered in cheese or ranch dressing). It was roasted with almonds, onions, and chilies- a shockingly delicious combination that I promptly devoured with enthusiasm. The pizza was equally delightful, with succulent meatballs and crispy prosciutto. We also tried the salted chocolate and caramel tart for dessert, which was a bit unnecessary after all that other great food, but still quite tasty. Overall, a delightful experience!",

Deconstructed and stressed wood and metal with touches of stylized glass chandeliers around an open bar area and casual seating make for a festive atmosphere day or night. While as the name says it is a pizza joint, it does offer a small variety of dishes such as mac n' cheese, as well as a selection of cold meats and cheeses from the chopping board behind the bar. Pizzas are the draw here and very good. I am disappointed their Arancini (rice balls) are no longer on the appetizer menu, but there are other tasty options that made me happy. You can't go wrong here, go!",

Considering that quality Italian pizza is hard to find in London, this is a nice restaurant with nice atmosphere and good service. Similar places with good italian pizza usually lack one of the other features, like the atmosphere. So this is a place I would go to every now and then especially if I have guests.",

    "text": "Yum! After coming back from a week of gorging on late night pizza in Brooklyn and the lower East side of Manhattan - I was not looking forward to the late night kebab culture. i wanted yummy pizza and that doesn't happen with any of our delivery options.My partner and I tend to eat quite late sometimes during the week (9/9:30 PM) just due to our rather manic schedules - and though we live in Shoreditch, it is not always easy to find a place serving that late. But then there is Pizza East - Open til 11 on the weekdays and always ON - I was shocked by how many people are still buzzing there at 9:30 on a weekday.LIKESFood: I love burratta. There are plates of cheese. nuff' said. Oh, and the pizza is delicious. AND the salads - I'm not sure why butter lettuce is so good but I would recommend it as part of the avocado salad!Service - Quick and friendly - we had our food in less than 10 minutes and could decide whether to make it a slow or fast night depending on cocktails and wineBuzzing: There is nothing to pick up your mood sometimes than a lively atmosphere. My partner had already been with a group of friends on a weekend and had a great time, and this time it was just the two of us chowing down. Sometimes I dont' always feel like i'm in a city when i'm roaming around our London streets (what a snobbish NYC thing to say) - and that can be wonderful - but sometimes you just want the buzz of city life and you definitely get that vibe here",

The venue is huge so there is little waiting time. Cost of pizza isn't prohibitive but you don't get a lot of food, and I didn't find the pizza particularly to my taste. Most other dishes, such as the salads, seem to be side dishes and cannot be ordered as mains, so the choice could be limiting if you want something else other than pizza.",

    "text": "The food is mediocre at best the experience was also mediocre at best...A friend of mine and came to Pizza east after I had a sudden pizza craving while in east London. We walked in and where made to wait for 15 minutes in their 'bar' area. Its not apparent where you order or where the wine list is, you have to ask around and *try* to find a waiter to get what you want in. We gave up and waited our turn to get seated. In the mean time though, the restaurant was far from packed but I believe they where heavily understaffed.When we sat down, I was handed the menu and then made a choice: Potato, Garlic, Pancetta pizza with some sharp Italian cheese which I can't remember. I was told that they had screwed up the menu and that choice was not available but rather it would be a pizza with no pancetta and rosemary instead which I found odd, they where not really willing to do what was on the menu which was a tad ridiculous so I went with what the waiter had said. We ordered drinks as well, I had a glass of a youngish primitivo... alas the primitivo was served in a thick small glass which was for me is a NONO.The piece de resistance is really that my pizza arrived BEFORE our drinks and I was then asked if we had already drunk out drinks (like it was our fault lol)Overall,mediocre. The wine list is mediocre. The food is not innovative and pizzas crumble to pieces when you slice them which means you have to sort of piece them back together to try to eat them and highly overpriced for what it is. The venue is nice but I highly recommend you look elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place has a very cool vibe, as others have already observed, very New York style trendy; being on the ground level of the Tea Building (aka below the infamous Shoreditch House).My one eye-rolling complaint would be the pretentious and elongated method of being seated, the whole (fake) trick of *we're just like so super awesome and busy we can't seat you just yet but spend more money at our bar while you wait* doesn't fool me when I can see that a good 25% of the restaurant tables are unoccupied but the waiting game I must play so I sit and drink my tap water a bit reluctantly until they decide to seat me 15 minutes later...The food was awesome though. And whilst the pizzas are great, even the non-pizza things are worth mentioning. They have a rotating dish-of-the-week in the non-pizza menu section which is either a roast meat/ gnocchi or pasta creation as well as fantastic seasonal vegetable side dishes (crispy artichoke with aioli butter was a highlight and the minted edamame).Most tables are communal dining which is fine by me but the seats were fixed to the floor making the whole situation a bit inflexible. They were of an interesting aesthetic (sort of swivelling-industrial-devices) but ultimately not the most comfortable. I would say Pizza East epitomises the general Shoreditch atmosphere and milieu, so worth a trip to take visitors for a bit of 'London Cool'.",

My pizza was incredible, veal meatballs, prosciutto and cream, though there was one bite which made me feel really sick. Not sure what was on it but it wasn't good. Or it was just me. Service is ok, they forgot to veganise one of my friends pizzas (no cheese if you're interested) and another friends margarita (pizza not drink, spelling may be off here) came 5 minutes after the rest of ours (other than vegan pizza the second). Finally, one friend paid upfront for his food as he had to get back to the office. They 'forgot' to take his food off the bill. That's why I'm throwing three stars at it. Nice place. Good pizza. Good beer. But one bad mouthful and some bitty service knocks it down.",

Industrial style everywhere. The pizza's are thin crust and tasty but overpriced. The house wine tasted like the fumes you cough up when you get a bit choked on your food. Don't order the house white.I didn't want to enter previously because this place is always crawling with Hipsters. No, not just a few dotted around. I mean crawling with them!The pizza menu is designed just for the Hipster brigade - wanna be quirky combos - they do not even have just mushroom pizza's, although will leave an item off or add one if you prefer, provided it is available.The music here is loud, so be prepared to shout across to your mates (as we had to do) to conversate. On hindsight, I would have preferred sitting at the counter but my friend didn't think to ask for that area.The pizza filled a crack and my mate ordered a dessert - I passed because nothing looked all that fab and I was growing weary of the shouting all around, Hipster's banging around because they don't know how to sit still and eat their food without wanting to be seen.The icing on the cake was, as we were leaving, they had bouncers on the door carding people wanting to get in.

There are a few salad choices and if you don't fancy a pizza, there are 5 or 6 dishes cooked in the wood oven like Mac 'n' cheese (\u00a38), Lamb shoulder with salsa verde (\u00a314) and Salt baked salmon with aioli (\u00a316).We were definitely in a pizza mood, we had been ever since we got back from Italy so Antonia had the Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza (\u00a38) with some prosciutto cotto added (+\u00a31.50) and I went for the Pork belly, tomato, fontina, mushroom pizza (\u00a311). Both were tasty and surprisingly filling - we probably could have shared one with a couple of antipasti dishes, although I thought Antonia's was a little stingy on the mozzarella front considering that was the main ingredient. My pork belly was delicious, maybe a touch dry but with nice crispy chunks of crackling mixed in.We were pretty impressed with Pizza East Shoreditch. They use good quality ingredients, cook them simply and authentically and the impressive space certainly adds to the experience.",

    "text": "Pizza East's fare is balanced--not authentic Italian but not the cheesy-overloaded American type either. It is somewhere in between. The bread's thin with a good crust on it. And the toppings don't overpower the flavor of the pie itself. Everything is subtle. The menu comprises of 10 or so pizzas (it is small), but each one is executed well. I should know--I work very close by on Shoreditch High Street and Pizza East is our goto place for all welcome lunches with new team members. So I've probably had everything on the menu. My absolute favorite, not just here but in all of London, is the heritage potato pizza. Not a conventional choice but it does hit the spot. It is not on the menu always, but I never order anything else if it is. Among the regulars, the veal meatballs, prosciutto, and cream pizza comes a close second. Topped with chilli oil, this one makes for a lovely lunch. Wash it all down with elderflower-lemon juice and you'll go back a happy chappy.",

As it was late on a Thursday night we did have a small wait for a table - but we filled this time with ordering wine and a DELICIOUS platter of cold Italian meats and a creamy ball of Burrata. We were then sat on the bar overlooking the open kitchen, which was lovely but I get distracted very easily so it wasn't such good news for my boyfriend!I was sad to see that the menu had become a bit less exciting - they seem to have become more like other pizza joints, whereas when I went last time they had a really creative menu. Anyway, I opted for a cream based pizza with veal meatballs - which sounded amazing on paper but when it came it was less so. The base was flavourless and the meat was far too salty! My boyfriend had a better experience with parma ham and rocket. I wish I had chosen that one! All in all it's still a great place - I expect I just chose badly. The starter was lovely and the service very good.",

But I do not absolutely love Pizza East.Why not?Well, although you can tell the ingredients are pretty fresh and decent, it suffers massively from being a hipster shoreditch place.What does that mean? Well, how about:1. It means the menu has lots of weird stuff. Great if you want to look cool. Not so great if you just want a nice simple pizza (though they were happy to accommodate my request for a simple pizza that wasn't on the menu)2. Queues to get in. Hipsters seem to love queuing up to get into places. Perhaps this somehow makes the food nicer for them, but for me it just means I am wasting time.3. It's got a great atmosphere for a bar but not so great if you just want a meal. It's kind of an event to go do Pizza East, but pizza is not really an event.Whilst the quality of pizza is a little better than say, Pizza Express or Ask, it's not so much better that you should go out of your way to come here, certainly not for the prices they charge.",

    "text": "Shoreditch has famously distinct areas for amazing Vietnamese (lower Kingsland Rd) and Turkish food (Upper Kingsland Rd- The Dalston end) \u00a0and of course the plethora of South Asian curry houses a la Brick Lane, you're spoilt for choice. Late after a busy Sunday evening with blood sugar levels plummeting and cold whipping our \u00a0ears, we slinked lazily into Shoreditch sweet spot on the corner, in the crossroads of it all, Pizza East. The mystery of not really being able to see in or out gives it a touch of exclusivity (part of the Soho House Group) and privacy when you need it most, when snarfing a superbly stringy sizeable stone baked slice. It has a stark industrial charm, low lit and warm, rather inviting.They have a coat check in service which always wins me over, I don't understand why more establishments don't have it here. They almost forcibly strip you of your outdoor wear as soon as you step into a building in New York. So on a Sunday night about 8.45 they were still busy! Long communal dining tables packed with daters dating over casual Pizzas, but more obvious were 1st daters sending their pizza remnances back to be boxed to take home to no doubt eat the rest in piggish privacy. We got sat at the bar, where the remnants of pizza were marched in to be boxed in a carry away. They always look like they'll taste great but revived by a microwave never do. So Mama mia, I'm going to have to be controversial. I didn't order a Pizza. My friend said it was like taking someone for a Chinese and seeing them order omelette and chips. I don't particularly care for Chinese food as it goes. I did my usual and went against the norm and was pleasantly surprised with the small \u00a0Antipasti plates and sides and really although small, it was more than enough. Chicken livers came gently charred with tasty pinkness, on pillowy smooth Polenta and not as advertised, but thank you- full of flavourful pecorino punching through it and smattering of piquant tangy Salsa Calabrese dotted on the dish, de-lish! This with a side of Cavolo Nero, Cabbage if you wondered, I did ask and this was steamed to perfection dressed in Sicilian lemon and olive oil. Italians don't half dress well. Staff aplenty were beautifully brusque and informative Italians who were happy to educate me on cheeses and even brought me an off-the-menu ripe Tallegio. Lovely but lacking in balance it needed a bit of quince or dare I say without sounding a pleb, pickle. \u00a0So with the help of a few translators and my google app next arrived a very much appreciated side of Quince and as if I needed it, rosemary olive bread. Well if you don't ask, you don't get, I didn't and I did. Lastly, the house hooch on tap was a quirky novelty, the red dangerously quaffable. too.",

    "text": "I went to Pizza East as part of a birthday dinner a few weeks back, and while it's a super neat space with a really cool atmosphere, for the most part I found it to be overhyped and underwhelming. It's not that anything was particularly bad about my experience, but nothing blew me away, and certainly nothing demanded the large crowd of people who were also dining there, hence the two stars.With my group of friends, we ordered appetizers, pizzas and dessert, as well as several bottles of wine. We certainly enjoyed our company, but unfortunately it came with quite a price tag, maybe not out of line with nice restaurants in Soho, but definitely on the higher end for the Shoreditch area. Additionally, the service was pretty spotty, except at the end where we were hurried out of the restaurant to make room for another party (which it's always nice to be forewarned about). The location is pretty great though, right on the corner of Shoreditch High Street. The atmosphere, as I mentioned, is really cool, industrial and funky and certainly worthy of a cool meal. Unfortunately, I was also kind of underwhelmed by my pizza, which was kind of Roman-style but with a weird variety of options for toppings and generally not as tasty as I prefer. All in all, it's a nice place, I'm glad I had a great time with friends there, but its's not quite enough to draw me back. Plenty of other new and/or better places in the area to enjoy.",

    "text": "Having heard the great reviews from friends, especially about the mouth-wateringly garlicky garlic bread, I pretty much wet myself in excitement when Pizza East was the suggested venue for a catch up with old work friends. (and yes, before you say, I'm sad - I get THAT excited by the prospect of food).Inside, it's typically Shoreditch cool - lots of crazy outfits that look like they require a manual to even get over your head, big and wild hairstyles and the tightest of jeans that just look dangerous. I quite liked the industrial dark metal and wood, it felt like you were in some underground cavern. The staff were as polite as could be, but were obviously rather rushed off their feet and pressurised to get people moving. We were hassled to order (admittedly, we were slightly later than expected) and some of the drinks we ordered had to be sent back as they were wrong. Normally I like to read every single item on the menu but being rushed, I didn't have this luxury. As a great potato fan, I was most intrigued by the pizza that came with potato, pancetta and puzzone (a most delicious cheesy cheese) and it didn't disappoint - I was reluctant to finish the last bite. My one comment was having been to probably more Pizza Express's than is legal, I generally use that as the baseline for rating pizzas and, as with all the pizzas I saw, they leave about 2 inches of bare crust around the edges. As everyone knows, this is on the same level of offence and horror as receiving a sandwich where the filling doesn't reach the edges. I was also slightly upset none of the pizzas didn't have names. Even something like 'George' or 'Bella' would have been better than nothing. Pudding was most exciting and the four of us shared the doughnuts, honeycomb \u00a0pannacotta and ice cream (pistachio, vanilla and honeycomb). All were dribblesomely good. All in all, it's a great place to head to for a casual catch up but I wouldn't go just for the pizza. I will definitely be back however, as there's some intriguing Antipasti that I've got my beady eye on.",

Considering this place gets called one of the best pizza joints in London, there is room for improvement. However, you can't argue with the prices - \u00a0it's only a few quid more than Pizza Express.However, the sides and dessert are what really sold it - the roasted potatoes were absurdly good, and both the gelato and the salted chocolate caramel tart were worth a trip back alone.",

I think it's the lighting that really seals the deal, although the open fire ovens and walls of wood sell the swanky Shoreditch vibe as well. The rustic interior is made more accessible by the choice of individual, bar, or communal tables which the helpful hosting team is happy to accommodate.Service was superb. Beyond friendly and attentively unobtrusive, I had wine in my hand before I ordered starters and a starter in my mouth before I ordered a main, just the way I like it. I was astounded by the depth of the menu - seabass carpaccio? Wood roasted bone marrow? Pork belly, borlotti beans, cavalo nero and salsa verde? Razor clams? Forgive me... but pizza, what? It was almost painful to put in two pizza orders after noshing on some of the most delectable bone marrow and calamari I've had to date, and I must say, even with egg, fontina and potato involved, the pizza was underwhelming at best. Although the plot thinned, it certainly did not ruin the experience - we happily chowed down. I mean, pizza *is* pizza, right?Listen PizzaEast attendees, it's good. Very good. Best pizza ever? Nope, not by a long shot. But for the price, the gorgeous venue, superb staff and fantastic accompanying cast, you'll love the show.Think of it like a movie that wins the Oscar for best supporting role... and perhaps best score, for good measure.",

    "text": "As I try and loosen my grip on Soho and Camden, by floating East now and again to experience new places in London Town, this cheeky venue was a perfect venue on Saturday for my friend Bexs' Birthday meal. Located in the venue formally known as the Tea Bar, which I had been to once or twice whilst at uni, but I can hardly remember it, Pizza East is where Elvis would eat a pizza if he had the opportunity. There's something very soothing about eating here. The people are relaxed and being in East London very cool, the staff are helpful and don't need prompting when liquid supplies are running low. They also handled our group of 16 with excellent timing and precision. The dim lighting and the iron tables all add to an atmosphere of people just reveling in the enjoyment of being out and about with one another whilst having some delicious food in the process. The food itself is delish. All the pizzas are ten-inches, made from an in house recipe, and topped with all manner of toppings ranging from Margherita to the more elaborate San Daniele ham, buffalo ricotta, hazelnut pesto and baby chard. i can, however, thoroughly recommend the spicy sausage and broccoli which will set you back about 12 golden coins. Pricey but certainly worth it. Once you have eaten and drank all you can (a meal with drinks will probably set you back about 20 nuggets) you can head on down to the downstairs bar which is low lit and stinks of cool. It's not cheap, but it's such a relaxed atmosphere, you won't mind too much. It's a great place to avoid the pretentious places in East London, whilst still revelling in its cool vibe. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "This place has got me totally confused. I tried to book a table for five for dinner on Saturday night and the person at the end of the line said we could either have a 6:30 or 10:30 seating. I felt a bit like Goldilocks when I said the first seating was too early, the second seating was too late and could I please, please, please have something in between? No dice. We got lumbered with the 6:30 slot, which I sheepishly sold into my friends as 'the opportunity to get in even more drinking time after dinner.' It was a good thing they believed me because we certainly did get the drinking time we wanted. My fiance and I arrived slightly late and were snarkily told that our booking was actually at 6pm, everyone was already at the table and that we needed to make sure we were done by 8pm. I thought he was joking and made a sarcastic comment about our booking actually being at 6:30 and walked off towards the table. \u00a0Turns out they misheard me when I made the booking and they thought we were in at 6pm, not 6:30 and thus progressed the fast dinner with the rude waiter experience. \u00a0Instead of joking around with us and trying to build a rapport, which may have increased his tip, our waiter was stony faced and annoyed thoughout the entire dinner, which made us even more persistent in cracking jokes at him and trying to make him laugh (which he finally did while we were paying the bill!).The decor in this place is stunning and they've done it up fantastically well, however I supposed anything's an improvement on the industrial bar space that used to be here. Too bad the food doesn't match the great decor. To start, we ordered what had to be the oilest garlic bread I've had in my life. They must have slathered half a ciabatta in an entire pack of butter and then chucked ten entire cloves of garlic on top. Gross. The pizzas were okay. Yep, just okay. I ordered the tomato, mozerella, olive, anchovy and caper pizza which arrived with a huge crust to pizza ratio. I just didn't need five inches of crust. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I so wanted this place to be good, but because my expectations were high, I was even more disappointed. \u00a0But we won in the end, because we were out of there at 8pm on the dot and oozed our way down to Concrete, the bar in the basement.",

But, living on the opposite side of London, I knew it was going to be a while before I'd make it out there.But finally! Finally! I have tried it, and friends, it is pretty good. First of all, consider your surroundings. This is not a humble place serving up just pizza - and great pizza at that. It's all about atmosphere. Communal tables, carafes of wine poured into small glass tumblers, industrial decor, exposed pipes, skinny-jeaned waiters, and pricey grub. This ain't no Pizza Express.Still - I had my dinner and it was good. It wasn't GREAT. But it was good. And one huge thumbs up from me: they have two pizzas on their already stripped down menu that don't contain any cheese at all! This is great news for my dairy-free compadres. I had the portabello mushroom pizza with no egg and it was lovely - cheeseless and all.And the olives and marcona almonds to start were lovely - more than enough for two people to share.Certainly there are elements of Pizza East to appreciate, but if I was really craving awesome pizza and didn't care much about the scene, I'd probably go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I have to say I disagree with some of the reviews below, but perhaps this place has stepped up its game recently. It is definitely worth going out of your way for if you like pizzas that are more either \"New York\" or rustic Italian style. However, be advised you should book a table in advance. Cool warehouse-y ambience and interesting food makes this a welcome change from the usual pizza experience. Pizzas: Topping of gourmet cheeses and meats usually not found outside of a proper Italian delicatessen. Not to worry for those with more tame tastes, as they do have a basic mozzeralla and tomato pizza on the menu. The base is made of wheat and thinner and crispier than the norm. Starters: Had the octopus and potato which was absolutely lovely.Wine& beer: Not too thrilled with the white wine selection, the red was much better. Good draught beer selection. Service: Very good, staff greeted us with a warm smile and were helpful with menu items I wasn't familiar with, but I could see how the place quickly gets manic. Advance reservations highly recommended.",

We had mussels with aioli, calamari, and two pizzas. We could have had more it was so delicious. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the pizza crust was perfect. \u00a0I especially loved that they put a solid amount of sauce (most places here don't!) on the pizza. \u00a0 Thankfully I don't live near by or I would be there every week.",

I very much liked the deco, especially those funky lamps. PIZZA EAST also serves convincing food. Man, the garlic bread was just awesome! And these olives which were served with roasted almonds were mouth-watering. We also highly appreciated the choice of buying home filtered water for a good price instead of the usual mineral water. And then came the pizza! It had a thin dough, crispy and perfect. The toppings were fresh and just in the right amount so the pizza didn't start sagging. Great place for food and people watching in a hip area.",

    "text": "I only had the option for 1 star, but actually I would give it 0.5!We went last night for a friend's birthday. He had tried to book a table for 18 over the phone, but the lady he spoke to, who was apparently very rude and unhelpful, said that the chef 'could not cope with a table of 18'! How unprofessional is that?!We were told we could sit at 2 tables, although I'm not sure what difference it actually makes if we are all together or not.We had a table booked for 8pm but we weren't seated until after 9pm, at 2 tables at opposite ends of the restaurant, even though there were empty tables together (apparently they were booked, it seems by them running an hour late, it meant we lost our seating!).During our meal the waiter didn't come over once to see if we wanted more drinks or anything, and in fact when we wanted anything we had to go off and find it!We asked repeatedly for condiments that didn't actually arrive until we had pretty much finished. Coffee after dinner took 25 minutes to arrive, and only after we had asked for it twice.The food was substandard- my pizza was about 70% crust, and had 4 measley dribbles of cheese on it- they must be making a fortune by selling warm bread at \u00a312 a pop!It also tasted so strongly of garlic that I couldn't taste anything else. I love garlic, but that doesn't mean I want to taste it for several days afterwards.We complained so much that they didn't charge us for our drinks, but I've worked in enough restaurants to know that if people are that unsatisfied, they shouldn't charge us anything at all.They even had the audacity to charge us service charge, then come back to our table to tell us there was 25p missing off our bill!I think it's safe to say that none of us will be going back, and I will also be telling everyone I know not to go. You get better food and service at Pizza Express!This place is truly awful, I have never been to such a bad restaurant.I will be emailing them this review as well!",

The loos are great aswell .. old wooden doors, big victorian taps and Cowshed soaps and handcream. We were seated on time. The restaurant was busy but not too loud. The service was fantastic. We had bruschetta and Calamari to start. Both perfectly cooked. Then Pizzas to follow..the pizza bases are amazing! Almost buttery. Really yums! We found the service great, the decor great and the food great. Would absolutely recommend and go back again!",

    "text": "Finally made it here. I had been meaning to try it for ages and never had the chance or, probably more accurately, made the effort. With a bit of New Year's resolve, managed to make a booking for Sat night.Firstly, take note of their table times. I was told that I could have my table for two on Sat night for 1.5 hours when I received the confirmation call for the booking. When I called to let them know I was running late, I was informed that the table would be held for 30 mins past the booking time and then released. Fair enough on both counts and appreciate the clear advance warning. If such policies exist, it's good to be told beforehand. We shared a lardo speck crostini to start and then had a pizza each. The crostini was quite good but a bit confusing. There were two pieces and I think one had the lardo and the other had the speck. It took me a little while to figure that out. My spicy sausage, mozzarella and tender stem broccoli pizza had good flavors. But I understand previous reviewers' comments about how the pizza is limp because it was. Limp and soggy in the middle. I still enjoyed it though. For desert, the salted caramel tart with the whipped cream on the side was luscious and just right - salty and chocolatey and the right amount of caramel. As my friend was saying, you don't go to Pizza East for the best pizza in London. You go because it's a Shoreditch institution and it's still there. Pizza East planted a flag on that corner before the first ironically bearded hipster dared to venture into the neighborhood. For that reason, I would probably go again if the opportunity presents itself. Also, when we left a mobile phone on our table, one of the servers chased us down the street in only his plaid shirt to return it to us. Now that's good service.",

    "text": "So I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I went with 4 because of the great value and good service. Great value, you say? Well on Mondays for members it's all half-off... even the drinks! Our table of 6, with drinks, starters, and mains still came in under \u00a3100. Impressive. The service was a bit odd - we ended up being served by 3 different people, but lucky for us we got the best one first who marched me through each item on the menu, super quickly, marking the items that would be gluten free. Not only did she know her stuff, but she was very friendly about it. It was generally most of the menu, save the pizzas (not surprisingly!). We ordered the pork belly and chicken cacciatore as mains, which is where my 3 stars debate comes in. The pork belly was prepared at least in a way that I am not familiar with, which resulted in the skin turning into a greasy and difficult to chew substance reminiscent of a bad pork rind, and the meaty part was dry and lacking in flavor. I ate very little of the dish. The chicken was better, but was a very large portion of food on a plate a bit too small which made it difficult to navigate (but convenient, because we ended up splitting it). It was cooked well and the vegetables were tasty. The other guests had a mix of pizza and pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy their meals much better.The starters treated us well, though. We did a mix of meats and cheeses for the table, along with the olives and almonds and a butter lettuce salad. The meats and cheeses were a great deal - hefty portions and quality products (especially the burrata... mmmm...). All in all, a good stop, but I would recommend sticking to what they do best if you can - the pizza. It is named for it, after all.",

    "text": "In Pizza East I've found my go to Sunday brunch spot in London, a conclusion I arrived at after noshing here two Sundays in a row. Their pizzas are thin crust with a thick doughy edge - not consistent with an Italian style - but tasty to be sure. And they're good for sharing. Our buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pie was heavily sauced which is great if you're into that (I am.) The sauce may be slightly too sweet and pasty and I could have used more basil, but overall the pizza's delicious.The butter lettuce salad with avocado was a great complement to the pizza but it needed more seasoning and some acid (a squeeze of lemon could've done a lot for it.)We got the lamb meatballs but between them and the pizza we had two competing red sauces so I would not recommend ordering these two together. Once again, not a traditional Italian meatball but instead, a Mediterranean influenced one using lamb and other spices.Ambiance wise, the space is a warm one.They've transformed an industrial warehouse (lots of concrete) with low ceilings into a very cosy, inviting place. In the loos, with their exposed copper pipes and worn wood stall doors, you really sense you're in a building that was once something very different. The hand cream near the soap is an especially nice surprise for dry, chapped winter hands.During Sunday afternoon service the crowd was very mixed: couples, couples with kids, larger groups - my kind of place.Getting a table for two at 13:00 on Sunday hasn't been a problem (read: no wait.)I'd take Pizza East over Story Deli (just a block away on Redchurch) any day.",

The place is usually packed, but the food arrives super quick. I love the industrial decor, although some tables may be a little bit too dark (try to book a table by a window, which are bright and you can observe the quirky hipsters flocking into Box Park. My favourite pizza is the one with aubergine, smoked mozarella and pesto. It's full of flavours which complement themselves. The pizza is really juicy, but crispy where it needs to be crispy. Apart from pizzas there are many other options, like salads, meet and veg.They also have an interesting selection of cocktails. Last time I went for Picante de la casa - Gran Centenario Plata, lime, agave, chilli, coriander. If you like savoury/spicy cocktails, you'll love it!I've never tried their desserts until last week. And since I'm a cheese monster, I went for (more of greed than of hunger) a cheese board , which I regretted 5 minutes later when I saw the cases and gelatos of my companions coming in. The cheeses weren't fresh, in some cased I would even say they were on a \u00a0borderline. But the portion is generous, 2 people easily can share it.",

We were then invited to the table and had our orders taken. We both took the cheese and black truffle pizza. Tasty, maybe a bit soggy. It did not take too long for the pizza to come, around 15 min.The prices are decent for the location. The pizza is around \u00a312-15. The service was great as well, all the waiters were very nice to us.I definitely reccomend this place!",

    "text": "Pizza East is most definitely not worthy of 5 stars. Four stars would be pushing it but three stars is too little, so I've settled on 3.5 stars.Service was friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was packed. The restaurant is spread over two floors and I was happy to find out that our reserved table was on the upper floor, next to the bar. As noted by another reviewer, this is the best place to sit. I think I would have had a terrible time had we been seated downstairs because it was incredibly packed and very, very loud. So loud that we would have not been able to have a conversation while seated at a table.The food here is not spectacular and the pizza is definitely not the best in London. Yes, it's good but I don't think I would make a return visit unless, maybe, if I were starving and in the area.Lamb meatballs - they were OK but they had a strange aftertaste and the tomato sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.Salami pizza - way, way, way too much salami. They could have used half the amount of salami and it still would have been too much. It overpowered the pizza completely and I made a mess of my plate by picking 75% of it off. The base in the middle was soggy and the crust was nothing special. It almost tasted a bit cornmealy like the pizza at Otto. The positive thing about the pizza was that it was sliced so I did not need to whip out the pizza cutter I had stashed in my handbag.Mac n' cheese - the one time a dish in this country requires cheddar cheese, it doesn't contain it. I liked the mac n' cheese more than my husband but I don't think I'd order it again. Too much fat for not that great of a taste.Salted caramel dessert thingy - I had no desire to order this dessert as the name was very off-putting. Salt, chocolate, and caramel. No thanks. We ordered it anyway based on the rave reviews and it was the best part of the meal. The salt was spindled on top of the chocolate layer and wasn't overpowering.Santa Maria Pizzeria in Ealing and Saporitalia just around the corner have better pizza, in my humble opinion.",

Enormous location, cool setup looking out onto the Boxpark - industrial feel - good music - great atmosphere!Pizza here was good, if slightly inconsistently cooked. Crust was amazing on the outside, good flavor, well cooked in a hot pizza oven. But, it was a bit soggy in the middle, and required a little bit of silverware. Toppings were good, though not exactly what they stated. Prosciutto was a little too much like ham, and the spicy sausage was less than spicy. Overall though, a great pizza.Very quick pizza service - really happy with that aspect of it. And it seemed as though there was always a server nearby when needed. It was towards the end of the evening, but still - very quick service for any time of day.Excellent place for groups, be prepared for the pizzas coming out super fast, and enjoy the cool atmosphere!",

If you've cleverly booked in advance (or you've got a date with good chat to distract you - check!) then go for it!It's possibly the most hipster pizza place in town - industrial-chic (read: unfinished) interior with exposed ceiling vents, lighting so low you can barely read the menu, a menu full of ingredients you don't understand, and very lovely waiters who all have beards and tattoos.It's not perfect - the pizzas aren't cheap and the middles go a little soggy. But the bases taste fresh and the toppings are certainly interesting. Watch out for the nduja one - it almost fried my tastebuds it was so chilli! I do like the compact cocktail selection too - my 'New Fashioned' on Saturday really hit the spot. Come for these and the fun buzzy vibe, just not for the pizzas.",

    "text": "Pizza East is in Shoreditch, housed in the Tea Building which is home to Shoreditch House and Dirty Burger - all of which are owned by the Soho House Group.The interior has a warehouse feel about it and is open, with high ceilings and an industrial vibe. At the entrance, there is a small area with a big wooden table in the centre for drinks and charcuterie. Venture further in and you have the main dining area, with a central bar dotted with high stools for bar dining. It can get very busy with walk-ins during lunch time, so a colleague and I booked a table for two. The style of service is informal and friendly which is perfect for lunch. We were greeted immediately at our tables, but given time to scan the menu. I was so hungry, which from experience should tell me I will order more than I can eat. Regardless, I went for two courses.To start, I had barolo carpaccio, shaved pecorino and girolles. Oh my god, I love mushrooms in dishes, especially the more wild and exotic variations. AND I also love cheese, so two out of three favourites on my plate! The carpaccio stood up to these two favourite ingredients of mine, with its slightly smoky taste. My colleague had bruschetta with fig and burrata which I have obsessed about in previous reviews, as it is the most of delicate of Italian cheeses with a sold outer shell and smooth creamy inside. Lush starters thank you very much.The main course is where my eyes proved to be bigger than my stomach. Crispy pork belly, served with salsa verde, red cabbage and butter beans. Wow. The pork belly meat was tender and was perfectly partnered with the finely chopped herbs, garlic and other bits. It was an effort to work through this epic portion of meat. I was reluctant to leave any of it, but I literally could not take any more. Perhaps best to miss out a starter with this dish to ensure you lick the plate clean.As a vegetarian, my fellow diner had the pizza with artichokes, tomato, rocket and marjoram. Good pizza and a good price.A good spot for lunch, but I imagine that it will also great on the long wooden tables with a group of friends too for an evening session. I will definitely be back here soon.",

As the place filled up we could barely hear ourselves across a four top table. The food ranged from very good to average; my rocket/fennel salad was outstanding, fresh and perfectly dressed. My lasagne was overcooked to just below burnt - enough that I didn't send it back, but I missed the great cheesiness it should have had if it wasn't so charred. Our apps were fine - garlic bread, calamari, and lamb meatballs. Nothing I'd be driven back to have again, but good for what they were. My friends enjoyed their pizzas. The service was hit or miss - it doesn't appear anyone is actually \"assigned\" to your table, so food gets delivered from different people, and you end up flagging down others to refill water, etc. - and each time it took a while, and several times we had to ask more than once. I think there are better options out there.",

I actually didn't get a pizza, after all that! Other reviews said the pizza was alright but other things were better. So I tried the avocado, pancetta, and tomato focaccia, \u00a35, lamb meatballs in tomato sauce, \u00a35 (asked for it with grilled bread, which came free of charge!), and the artichoke and aubergine fritti, \u00a36, accompanied by a Bethnal Pale Ale, \u00a34.All that would have been too much for me, but I was with a friend so we shared the fritti. It was delicious - a small portion but just enough to leave you wanting more without getting bored of it. (We added chili flakes to the mayo sauce for zing.) The foccacia was lovely, and brimming with avocado, but would not have been enough on its own. The lamb meatballs were mouthwatering, but by the time I was done eating all three, I was really glad of that bread because damn were those babies salty! Delicious, but a bit too salty, I think. I even got to try the pizza, because that's what my friend ordered. Good tasting crust, a mix of crispy and chewy. She had the prosciutto cotto, tomato, mozzarella, artichoke, \u00a311. That type of prosciutto is more like ham, and the 'tomato' was just sauce, not on top, while she reported the pizza to be under-cheesed. Oh well, that allowed me to take a bite. It was good, but not great. The decor is cool. Could be in NYC or LA but fits right in across from the Box Park. Service was ok but not exceptionally attentive.All in all, it was a nice meal in a nice place but not raveworthy. 3-stars \"A-OK\" fits perfectly.",

We got a slice of the dark chocolate, salted caramel tart - served with whipped cream. It was quite decadent and the caramel was the perfect consistency. The atmosphere was also really cool - open bar areas, group seating and fun vibe. I would go back with a group of friends and recommend as a place for a quick hangout or drinks.",

First of all, the warehouse style interior is at least three times as spacious and more tasteful than you'd imagine. Then take a look at the menu and be perplexed by the \"Vegetables\" category. Yes, there's an own section for vegetable dishes, not vegetarian pizzas, no, just vegetables. We ordered Roasted Broccoli with Chillies and Almonds, Roasted Fennel with Salad on Harrissa Lentils, and Garlic Bread. Both the Broccoli and the Fennel had a wonderful smoky flavour and were arranged wonderfully. I'll defenitely revisit and order Fennel again.",

    "text": "I've been to Pizza East twice now and largely enjoyed the food, the buzz and the service. I can definitely see the potential for it all to go wrong though - they are incredibly popular and I can imagine that during their busy times, they would be too frantic to service the number of tables they have without sacrificing somewhere. The one time I tried to book, it was for a group of 12 and was told we had to take the group menu, which I felt was too much food and too expensive without enough flexibility. Deciding to press ahead anyway, the event manager booked me in, then had to apologise the next day when the promised date/time was no longer available and we were booked instead at a much earlier time. Needless to say we went elsewhere. However, for my own personal visits with smaller numbers, I've had a great time. They're open late, and I have taken advantage of that both times. On these occasions, I've been able to wander in around 10pm without a reservation and be seated immediately. The service was lovely, stylish, v hip and most importantly, efficient with attention to detail. I think the food is quite reasonably priced considering it's part of the Soho House stable. There are some exceptions to the rule, but happily they didn't interest me. Even the wine selection is quite reasonable, with a decent spread of wines and prices. Wine is served in tumblers, keeping the vibe down to earth. The dishes we've tasted have all been delicious - the star being the roasted bone marrow served with a fresh crisp parsley and radish salad on the side. Scrape the marrow out, spread it on the accompanying toast and sprinkle the salad on top. Absolutely divine!! The pizza menu will not please those who are used to having loads of ingredients and the ability to customise their pizzas. It's definitely more in line with the more authentic italian vibe (fewer ingredients per pizza, keeping flavours simple to showcase the ingredients and the pizza base). Yeah I can see the comparison to the NY pizza style also. The pizzas are big enough for 1 hungry person, more than I could eat with starters. My tip - eat what you can, then take the rest home. It's even better COLD! My favourite pizza is the spicy sausage with sprouting broccoli (but then.they had me at spicy...). I prefer it over the veal meatball one. I need to try the other flavours too but as long as they all have the gorgeous crusty charred base. Best pizza in the neighbourhood. Wouldn't go out of my way to go there but if you're in the Hoxton/Brick Lane area anyway, it's a good option.",

People said wow it's like a NY place. Um ok. Is that a good thing (outside of NY)? So, I overlooked the fact that they can't make a pizza Margherita (my test of a place that has pizza in its name). I don't know how much sugar they thought would be good to use in the red sauce, but seriously, stop. And then try using good mozzarella. Or maybe a cheap flight to Napoli to see how it's done. Or a jaunt to Santore' up the street, if Napoli is out of the question. Anyway, I digress the chicken livers were good, as was the polenta. However, on my second visit, the only reason I didn't do an immediate about face was that I was there for a birthday party. Before we could even enter the restaurant (on a recent very cold and rainy night), the maitre d' put up his hand in my face and made us wait in the cold (while he was warm) while he dealt with other more important customers. Helluva welcome, buddy. If that's NY style, then you got it in spades and I don't want it. When he finally deigned to let us in and we informed him of our reservation, he shrugged us off to a colleague who had been sitting there idly while he sorted out the important peeps. I hoped the food would save my soured opinion of the place, but it was even more mediocre than the last time I had been there and too salty, too sugary, overcooked and ineptly served by clearly overwhelmed staff. The only reason this place gets two stars is that the interior is beautiful.",

It's just right opposite boxpark and shoreditch overground Station.This place has good vibes, absolutely in love with the industrial interior design. Single tables are a little tight for two. I'd suggest you go for the round ones if there's one available.I wouldn't say this is artisinal pizza or anything fancy like that. It's just different. We had the Veal meatball and shrimp chilly. The veal is a little salty for my liking, but I thoroughly enjoyed having both. I usually don't eat my crust but this was just next level. I hope they consider cheesy crust next time.We also bone marrow with cipollini and burrata to start. The bone marrow is a must try. It comes in threes with the marrow juice between the bones. Personally I wouldn't share this because it's not a whole lot, also its incredibly addictive. The burrata presentation wasnt half as impressive but I'd say the cheese was equally amazing.They have really nice cocktails available here. We had Salento (hendricks gin and pineapple) and a Streaga. Not the cheapest cocktails around! \u00a39.75 each. Finally finished off with tiramisu and coffee.Total bill came up to less than \u00a385 for two. This includes two starters, two cocktails, two pizzas, one dessert and two coffees. A little upscale but definitely worth the bill.",

    "text": "Yessssss delicious pizza! And from the mouth of a New Yorker, this means something. Typical NY, thin-crust pizza with a hint of burned crust. Loads of toppings and flavours. I got the aubergine and pesto pizza with squash added a top. Not one topping was skimped on. The rich roasted aubergine and thin-sliced squash, together with the tomato sauce, are just fabulous. I ate the whole pizza! The price gives me sideye- at \u00a312 a medium-sized pie, it's not cheap- but it's so damn good I would return. It wasn't overly busy when we stopped by this Sunday afternoon. Just dinking a star because my husband had the burrata antipasti and the cheese is pretty bland. Have had far better burrata at Obica and in NY. Also the glass of Pinot Grigio (decent enough) is pretty pricey at \u00a38/glass. But my husband said the lamb meatballs were quite tasty.",

Maybe the concept is to reflect a kitchen table but falls flat.- Pizza was soggy- Communal tables tight and cramped- beer selection was really poor with limited craft options- Service was dire. They add a discretionary service charge which is fine but we opted to deduct 2 euro to reflect experience and the server returned to question as if we had failed toboay. We explained our reason but he was biligerant. \u00a0Tip is always discretionary so done expect and certainly never come back to a table as if to assert the bill was left shortThere are no positives. We left bewildered and personally I was furious by such poor manners.Good luck to those who enjoy but not for me and certainly failed to deliver any rustic Italian hospitality.",

Only wished the crust was more crispy/less droopy. -Butter lettuce avocado salad: Simple yet tasty. Very mustardy dressing, perhaps a tad too salty for my taste. -Cauliflower: we were not expecting a huge head of cauliflower! Never had it with yogurt and salsa. Really good and made the meal way more balanced. I washed everything down with a Camden Pale Ale. Pretty good combo!Very casual, industrial feel. Soap and hand lotion smells so good!",

The ceiling looks very industrial like it was once a warehouse and the floors are panels of wood (like a boardwalk). They also have an open kitchen concept and lots of seating.As for service, we were seated right away as we had reservations and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly.To drink I got a mojito -- not the best but definitely not the worst. I know mojitos are supposed to full of half ice but this was filled over the top and after a few sips my mojito was done. Our food came about less than 10 minutes after ordering which was amazing as we were both starving! To eat I got the pizza with eggplant and spinach on it (I forget the actual name on the menu) and my niece got the spicy sausage pizza which she really enjoyed. My pizza on the other hand was mediocre. We both agreed that the crust could not hold up the toppings at all so when lifting a slice of pizza it would literally droop down. Overall I enjoyed this place and its atmosphere. However, I would give this place 3 stars which is what I rated it as it was not the best pizza I've ever had but it was good. For a pizza place, you don't expect the toppings on a pizza to literally slide off the dough, cheese and all. P",

    "text": "Our beloved Tequila Girl 1 selected this resto having spent time researching a place in London that could accommodate my allergies, bless her heart. Five stars for the food, two for the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere and four for the service. Inside - only one seating option was offered for our group of four which was a communal table. \u00a0No issue there; I was raised to share. The problem were the seats. How to describe? Think uncomfortable bar stools that are attached to a post by a swinging arm, like university chairs but without a back portion. Not good for the disabled among us. Volume - loud. Really loud. Again, not an issue for us, but I wouldn't take grandma there. You have to shout to be heard even by the person sitting next to you. Atmosphere is industrial depot meets Italian grocery store. It came as no surprise that this is a converted tea warehouse.Service - we stressed my allergies, and the server heard them, but the kitchen didn't receive that message so my pizza had to be sent back. They automatically add a 12.5% gratuity to the bill which is referred to as \"discretionary\", a misnomer at best. This puts the customer in the uncomfortable position of asking to have it removed, if unwanted. If they sincerely intended to make it at the customer's option then that would be the recommended gratuity, not the default. Except in the worst of circumstances I always tip generously, but I'm not keen to have it taken in this fashion.Drinks - they sell very large bottles of Peroni (\u20ac7.50). Tip: if more than one of your party are ordering beer then just order one bottle at a time and split it. That way the next one will be cold. Look at me, always with the planning. Sparkling water was only \u20ac2, which was the best deal of the whole trip. A carafe of a very nice ros\u00e9 was \u20ac16.Food - Once the edible version of my order arrived it was fantastic. Everyone in our group ordered pizza and enjoyed it (\u20ac14). It's Napoletano, with that great charred veneer and thin crust. TG1 and her beau shared the meatball appetizer (\u20ac6). Overall, we had a great time. My only hesitancy about returning would be that a reservation is a necessity in order to secure better seating, and we don't like to make reservations when on vacation so that we aren't tied to a schedule. If I were in the neighbourhood and they had something other than the communal tables available I would happily go back.",

The pizzas are a bit on the alternative side - I guess they're trying to be more gourmet with them, but I find the base too thin in the middle and too crusty, and the ingredients a bit poncy. Call me old fashioned but give me a straight up bin lid any day (try the Stringray's Globe Cafe up on Columbia Road). I'd consider myself a food enthusiast but here the flavours are bizarre and a lot of them don't come with cheese which surprised a few people in our party! Some are a decent price (\u00a37 or \u00a38) but then they go up to stupid figures, like \u00a314 for the duck meatball one (I had it, and it's not worth it). The garlic bread was hard, greasy and cold. A friend had the \u00a310 lasagne and it was just a small square. The sea bass looked alright though. On the plus side, it's huge so good for large parties, the loos are immaculate, and it's open late. So there are plenty of reasons to go to Pizza East - but not the pizza, imho!",

    "text": "Pizza East - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I recently came to this stylish new eatery in Shoreditch's Tea Building, premises of the former T Bar. Pizza East has an elegant d\u00e9cor and subtle lighting, helping to create a warm and intimate atmosphere. The building's industrial heritage has been intelligently maintained in the exposed bricks and pipes, with the large windows giving a trendy and sophisticated feel which is reinforced by the fashionable clientele. We were greeted by the friendly front of house staff, but were asked to wait until a table became available for us as we had no booking. There is a waiting area with a large communal table by the restaurant's bar where we sat and drank a 500ml carafe of their Prosecco on tap \u00a319 and a few pints of Peroni \u00a34 each. It was a Thursday evening, the place was very busy and noisy, and it took them 50 minutes to seat us. I was pleased to see a short but eclectic menu showing some fine starters and desserts alongside the interesting pizze. As a party of 5, we ordered a selection of starters to share and a pizza each. The Sheep milk ricotta bruschette, lambs lettuce with honeycomb and sea salt @ \u00a36 was delicious with the ricotta and honey marrying beautifully together. The bruschetta bread was also nicely toasted and chewy. The Mortadella spread, pistachios, mostarda on rustic bread @ \u00a35 was also good, although the portion was not overly generous. Mortadella is one of the least popular of Italian cold meats in the UK but is one of my favourites. It can be rather fatty and goes very well in a simple sandwich of fresh baguette and butter. The star of the evening however was the Wood roasted bone marrow, radish, parsley, on rustic bread @ \u00a37. My last taste of bone marrow was at St John's a few years ago, and I remember loving it then. I was not disappointed this time round either: the marrow had a deliciously concentrated meaty flavour and melted in the mouth. One of the best dishes I remember spending my \u00a37 on. I ordered a Salami, tomato, mozzarella, red onion, and chilli flakes pizza @ \u00a310. The combination of toppings was simple but nicely put together and with good flavours. The most interesting aspect of the pizza however was the fine dough \u00a0the base was thin but had a great chewy consistency. It was beautifully charred giving a woody flavour to the dough. It was an excellent pizza, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The other pizze eaten by my dinner companions were Veal meatballs, prosciutto, sage, lemon, parsley, and cream pizza @ \u00a312; Speck, tomato, mozzarella and rocket pizza @ \u00a311; Clams, tomato, oregano, garlic, chilli flakes, and pecorino pizza @ \u00a312 (apparently a speciality of New England, USA), it looked yummy, and I wished I had ordered that one myself! The general opinion was that all pizze were good, toppings were simple and flavoursome although slightly ungenerous; the base was indeed the best part \u00a0chewy, fine and deliciously charred. We also felt that prices above \u00a310 were a tad high. We unfortunately did not have any of the desserts \u00a0although I heard that their Hot cinnamon sugar doughnuts with Varlhona chocolate @ \u00a36 is to die for. The total bill was \u00a3180 (incl. 12.5% service) among 5 people, or \u00a336 each. In addition to the food, we also had three 500 ml carafes of Prosecco on tap \u00a319 each, 5 pints of Peroni beer \u00a34 each and a glass of Sauvignon blanc @ \u00a38. This is more than I would normally feel happy spending on a mid-week evening \u00a0we spent more on drinks than we did on the delicious food. I will certainly be coming back to Pizza East for more roasted bone marrow, clam pizza and hot cinnamon doughnuts, but will stop at a local pub for a good pint beforehand! Verdict \u00a0Trendy and beautiful decor, delicious pizza base and toppings at above average prices. The best roasted bone marrow on chunky toast in town and friendly, efficient service make Pizza East a fine place, and one to which I will definitely return.

I have become a bit of a pizza snob these days as the standard of pizza has seriously improved in recent years in the city, so I would give this place a seven or of ten for the pizza itself. However the real draw of this place is its location in the heart of trendy shoreditch, and is prefect if you are going out with a group of friends. Music billows with a vibrant cool atmosphere in what looks like an old warehouse. Service can be a little 'trendy' e.g. we asked for another drink from a passing waiter only to be told \"i don't DO drink orders\" which we actually ask found rather amusing more than anything.",

Pizzas are a little bigger than Pizza Express ones but the base and toppings are a hell of a lot more impressive. I had a portobello mushroom & egg pizza while my friend has a pepperoni one. Both came piping hot, with a generous portion of delicious toppings and one of the nicest pizza bases we've ever had (I think only bases in New York top this, though I'd love to be told about other brilliant ones?)Their website has a menu with prices so you can check that out before you go but expect to pay about \u00a325 a head for pizza, wine and an extra nibble or two with service.A great plus is that chilled filtered water is provided by the bottle for free.The place has just opened but you wouldn't know it: service is polite and brisk and the venue seems to be finished to a really high spec. If you used to go to the T Bar you really won't recognise this place.I defy anyone to go here and say they had a crap pizza but this being Yelp, I bet someone will ;)",

For starters the dough is not heavy at all. It puffs up around the outside of your edible circle and bears all the hallmarks of fresh yeast in use.Toppings-wise there is a lot to choose from, and about 4 vegetarian options available which is always a bonus.Service isn't massively attentive, but I don't think it needs to be. You don't go to out for pizza to expect your own waiter, lurking over your shoulder topping up the vino. You go for tasty, filling and good value eats in a nice environment (that's not to say the staff aren't helpful).The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great. Even at 3pm on a Friday there's activity and plenty of people dotted around what is a vast eating room. There's a naked charm to the place, with all the exposed concrete and wooden floorboards, offset nicely by all the authentic extras they have hanging around and the roaring pizza oven.2 pizzas, 2 salads, 2 pints of Bitburger and a carafe of tap water came in at almost bang on \u00a350 including the 12.5% service charge.",

After working within the hospitality industry for many year I have earned the rite and gained the experience to know what is acceptable and critique it accordingly. never the less my rave review have been few and far between but I am please to add another to the current few.A Monday night at Pizza east is a bustling affair. Every seat was taken, the bar was full and a long line of eager non-bookings were awaiting for the rare chance of a table not turning up. This all explains the two hour limit for each booking.The American warehouse feel follows right through with an Italian and American mixed wine list which is a fair size starting at \u00a319 per bottle. The food menu is inspired and dynamic. For starters the lamb meatballs, pork rib, Courgette, aubergine fritti, roasted 3 colour beets and smoked mackerel were wonderful. Red mullet crudo was fresh and delish but I was the only one at a table of five that enjoyed it. The pizza list of twelve varieties were unique and interesting and the Mushrooms, ricotta, spinach, egg was perfectly cooked with the egg still runny coating the pizza as you slice, the Coppa, cima di rapa, mascarpone, pine nuts was gorgeous but no one in our party liked the veal, procuto and cream. All the pizzas were fresh, thin crusted with a large and crispy edge. The meal was beautifully finished with hot cinnamon dough nuts with melted chocolate and a selection of gelato.The service is impeccable. from the friendly greeting at the door to the non invasive, efficient and friendly floor staff I could not find a single fault.The atmosphere at pizza east is vibrant and has a real buzz, the food is great and the service friendly.

The restaurant in Shoreditch is located at the ground floor of an old tea factory using plenty of their relicts in the interior. Downstairs is a club that I didn't visit but I actually looked interesting.The branch in West London reminds more of a kitchen caused by the ceiling high tile walls and open pizza bar. Anyways, foodies that love pizza will find their happy place here! E. g. the Speck & Spinach Pizza is mouth-watering!Credit cards accepted!

The meatballs were delicious but the garlic bread was amazing. The garlic bread was even better when dipped in the meatball sauce. \u00a0I had the potato, pancetta, puzzone and garlic pizza. For a potato lover like me it was perfection. My husband and sister in law however aren't as big on potatoes and thought there was too much potato. My husband had the spicy sausage, mozzarella and tenderstem broccoli pizza. I tried a little and thought it was pretty tasty. The sausage was just a little spicier than I would prefer, but my husband loved it. My sister in law got the buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza. She enjoyed her pizza, but couldn't detect any buffalo flavor. After trying some, my husband and I could slightly detect it.My husband only got 1 bite of the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake before my sister in law and I devoured it. It was cheesecake at it's best. Not too soft, not frozen. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because of the extremely uncomfortable seats at the communal table that we got seated at.",

One of the best features is the small bar area with chunky wooden table. Make sure you fully understand the pizza you are ordering - some are, shall I say, experimental and may not be to your taste (for example the one I ordered that did not have a tomato base - but I think they have now taken that one off the menu). \u00a0Other dishes like pork belly or the salads or the garlic bread are also just.... just... amazing. \u00a0Puts most restaurants to shame at any price point in my honest opinion.For dining as a couple, try sitting at the eating bar area in the centre of the restaurant - you get very personal service from the staff there (we even got some free tasting!) and it feels more fun that a table for two. \u00a0The bar facing the kitchen is also good but it is quite hot and the service comes from behind you which doesn't work nearly as well - however, watching the chefs at work is good fun so if you are in the area on business and dining alone, I would thoroughly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar for a meal. \u00a0All in all, you just cannot fault this place - food of this quality often costs twice the price, it really is a must-see restaurant for hearty, casual food.",

Meh. We had the salted chocolate caramel and the doughnuts again suggestions of the staff. \u00a0I think it was the doughnuts that fully knocked them back down to 4 stars and made me question the staff's pallets. \u00a0They were fried in the same oil that a LOT of chicken had been fried in, so as soon as you ate them you tasted nohing but KFC. \u00a0Oh well, not eeryonw can be perfect right?

    "text": "Pizza East was on my to-do list of places to try before leave London, as my partner is a truly pizza-lover, so we came today for a Saturday lunch. I was quite impressed about the venue, I didn't imagine it was so big when I first saw the entrance. The warehouse decor is nice too, and the toilets are superb (they have hand soap and moisturizer from Cowshed, which I really liked).Staff were quite nice but a bit slow, despite it wasn't very busy at that time. We didn't mind anyway, as we had plenty of time and it was pouring outside.Regarding the food, I loved it. I had the fried polenta with San Marzano tomatoes and spinach, which was incredibly tasty, specially the tomatoes, full of flavour. I loved it, and it was only \u00a35.5. My partner has the pizza with ground beef, scamorza and dried tomatoes, that was very good. We finished the meal with 2 espressos, that weren't anything remarkable. We only drank one orange juice and still water, and paid \u00a330 including service, which I think it's a bit expensive, mainly because of the drinks. The orange juice, although it was freshly squeezed, was rather small (less than 200ml in a tiny glass), and each espresso was \u00a32.50.Overall, a very pleasant and good meal, and a recommended place, despite some items in the menu being overpriced.",

I wish +.7 (1.7/2) Sauce- Great sauce. Nice and flavorful.+.9 (2.6/3) Cheese- I love the buffalo mozzarella. Some people don't seem to care for it, but usually when I find it on my pizza, I know that it is going to be a high quality pizza. +1 (3.6/4) Toppings- I had the Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza, so no real toppings, but based on the quality of all the ingredients together, I'll add another point.+.9 (4.5/5) Atmosphere/Service- Like the rest of Shoreditch, Pizza East has a very \"cool\" vibe. I really dig the area and this place fits in perfectly with the Brick Lane crowd. I could see this fitting in nicely on Abbot Kinney in Venice for any LA natives reading this review. We also had great service from our waiter, who told us about all of his favorite dishes with a great amount of passion. I love when waiters are excited about the food they are serving. A true sign of a good place.Final Score:Pizza East - 4.5 slices",

Alas, I was not willing to go down to the local fast-food joint, so I wound up here via Yelp. I found my pizza to be delicious and satisfying, but seriously overpriced at nearly \u00a0\u00a312. The butter-lettuce salad with mustard seed vinaigrette was fresh and tasty. The donut and chocolate desert with a cup of pleasantly prepared cappuccino, was quite heavenly. The service was reasonable when it was there, but it odd how no one server seemed to be assigned to my table. This was a problem because they never seemed to know whether I had already been helped. I saw this happen to a couple other tables too. Maybe they are just trying to being helpful. Like many other Yelpers before me, I too was mesmerized by the interior design and atmosphere. I envied every aspect, from the layout, which was incredibly spacious, to the lighting and even the restrooms. I was there shortly after 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty quiet then, but patrons trickled in steadily. I imagined how this place must be at night. I fantasized about moving into this hip neighborhood and living an upscale social life just for this restaurant and everything it epitomizes. Maybe I would just settle for a job as a server instead... sigh!",

If you need to woo me, do it with a cheeseboard. But not just any old one. I was really excited to see the sheer variety of tapas-like dishes on Pizza East's menu, the meatballs and calamari alone were whispering sweet nothings to me. But dammit, the cheese must come first. I'll come back for you, meatballs, I never leave a man behind. We ate so much incredible oil soaked focaccia dipped in a creamy goats cheese and topped with proscuitto that I could have died happy. Seriously was the best thing I had eaten since my return from Vancouver. The pizza... meh. The service... inattentive but good when we got it. The atmosphere... much cooler and trendier that you expect from the outside. This is a huge place but mega popular. I'm already wondering when I can go back.",

    "text": "I know this archetype: It's Beretta in San Francisco, a new wave of Neapolitan-style pizza with good desserts, a selection of amari, and some cocktails. \u00a0I liked it, and I'll be back if I'm in the neighborhood, but I wasn't blown away.Our party of 3 waited 45 minutes at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night. \u00a0Not terribly surprising; we went around the corner for a pint, and the hostess took my cell number and called me when our table was ready.We were seated at the communal table, which is more like a cheek-by-jowl table: there is NO ELBOW ROOM at all, due to the fixed position of the stools. \u00a0None. \u00a0It was actually uncomfortably tight. \u00a0Hey Pizza East folks, I don't know if you can re-space the attached stools, but you really ought to consider it.The pizza (I had the basic: mozzerella, basil, tomato) was a good thin-crust style, though there was a certain graininess to the melted cheese that was slightly unpleasant. \u00a0My friends enjoyed their meaty pizzas.Desserts good; I had an averna to go with (+1 point for having an amari section on the drinks menu; -1 for putting Fernet Branca and Mente on it -- how about ones people want to drink? Oh right, I forgot we're in hipster-town -- it's more about the image than the taste).Overall I liked it, but I'm by no means in love. \u00a0Beretta retains its place in my heart.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place. The location is great, right on Shoreditch High Street and in the very cool Tea Building. No wonder it is always so busy. One would hope that the food will live up to the location, but I was quite disappointed. Pizza is made to order with a variety of toppings and at a reasonable price. However, the crust is not very thin and on the doughy side. I had a hard time cutting it with my knife. I resorted to scrapping the toppings off and left the crust behind. I also had the burrata, aubergine and tomato starter. I am a big fan of burrata cheese and I don't think you need to do much to it, just some olive oil and salt to let the fresh flavor shine through, but this starter didn't managed to do that. There are a lot of good restaurants in Shoreditch, so I don't think I will be coming back any time soon.",

    "text": "Good pizza joint with an industrial, warehouse ambiance which may not appeal to everyone. \u00a0The service was great when compared to elsewhere in London. \u00a0I had the veal meatball, prosciutto and cream pizza and it was tasty - could have used more prosciutto, but the dough and sauce were nicely done. \u00a0\u00a313 is a bit pricey for a pizza, but I suppose that's the toppings. \u00a0The pizza didn't impress me, but it did hit the spot after a busy morning.",

    "text": "Obviously this is a pit stop for anyone with an eye for a great pizza. Freshly cooked, perfect density to the dough and toppings were assorted and generous. I opted for the Margarita (in my opinion the door stop of any pizza joint - if you cant do that right your in the wrong business!) Fab. Had to ask for chilli oil but other than that the service was fine. Were not talking fine dining here just good honest well made pizza. Simple.",
