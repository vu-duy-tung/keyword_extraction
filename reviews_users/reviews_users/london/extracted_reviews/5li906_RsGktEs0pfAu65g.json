    "text": "After reading all these glowing reviews, I felt like I had to try out Byron when in need of a Soho based dinner last week. As it happens I ended up going twice in a week! First time round I had a cheese burger, chips and an oreo milkshake (hello my diet!). The shake was amazing - just like an Ed's oreo shake and served in a metal pourer in a similar style. I think it was even bigger though. When the burger arrived I was a little disappointed at it's size, but it more than filled me up. It just looks a little small in comparison to other burger joints that have sprung up around the last couple of years. It was tasty, but not mindblowing. Then I returned and tried the chicken burger. This is a whole new level. Marinated and freshly grilled this is probably the best chicken burger I've had in a very long time. It even felt quite healthy and was juicy and well cooked. We coupled it with the courgette fries which were a novelty but a bit pointless. Pretty expensive but probably my burger joint of choice in town for now! Chicken beats beef though. Who would have ever thought that.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to attend the soft opening of their newest location in Soho with my two brothers, all of us burger experts. To be honest, I wasn't sure what expect. I had heard good things about their other locations, and was hoping it wasn't going to be like a GBK. which I find extremely over rated. Byron's decor was sleek and comfortable. The booths were a very nice touch. Burgers always taste better in booths....it's science. The menu is small, but not lacking. You don't need more than about 5 kinds of burgers. And the beer selection was excellent, including some regional American classics such as Brooklyn lager. The burgers themselves were high quality and very tasty. However there are one or two niggles that I'd like to vent. Firstly the fries were awesome, but don't serve them in a seperate ramican, it looks pretenious, it creates more washing and the burgers look lost on the plates by themselves. My second point is, even if your default is to cook the meat med-rare, still ask the customer. It wad a soft opening, and we were looked after vey well, but I hope they listen to their suggestion cards as it has the potential to be somewhere great",

So far I'm averaging one visit per week and it's fast replacing Bodean's as my go-to comfort food W1 evening jolly. Their Byron burger is the closest thing you can get to a west coast In'n'Out style experience. It's soft, its meat:bun:condiment:sauce ratio is perfect. They have root beer and macaroni cheese as sides. My only minor improvement would be if the buns themselves were slightly glazed, but that's a niggly detail. The service can be patchy. My last visit I had to specifically ask for the Big D instead of it being offered as a special. Most times though it's been absolutely fine. They have a wonderful video projection on the south wall playing a collage of burger-related ads, most of them clips from Carl's Jr spots from the US. I adore Byron, and applaud their attention to detail and flawless execution of their product. There's nowhere else on Wardour Street I'd visit instead now. So go.",

To prove it, nobody spoke during the lunch just focus on eating :) The burger is big like in the film when you see an actor eating one in US. I took also french fries and there are quite good.

    "text": "Byron Burger, Soho. Opened in November and it has taken me this long to get my butt down there, my sincerest apologies to all of the no-one who really cares. But here I am, nestled amongst the don't-give-a-fuck trendiness that is so very Soho, under a lampshade that is a little bit too spidery for arachnophobic me, beside a Christmas tree sticker which if you look really closely, you'll notice is topped with a little cow. This is Byron being cool, without being cool. The order was s.i.m.p.l.e. this time ~ a Byron burger (dry cure bacon, mature cheddar, Byron sauce) for Panu, and a gruy\u00e8re cheeseburger for me. Oh and my quintessential A&W root beer float. I dig Byron's burgers. It's a bit hard to explain but the best way to describe it is that it tastes like a good clean burger. I still love Ultimate Burger's BBQ beef burger, the generous dollop of BBQ sauce and sweet onion relish oozing between my fingers and lips, but this is completely different. After consuming a whole burger, one (namely me) doesn't feel heavy or sickeningly full. I was also particularly impressed with the meat this time, something which I didn't notice last time, but the patties were cooked a perfect medium, if a little on the rare side. Slightly pink-ish, deliciously juicy. In fact I pointed it out to Panu a few times like do you see this meat? Do you see how good it's cooked?! til he swatted me away. Quite literally. So Byron Burger gains another two thumbs up from me. But check this out, Panu, who claimed LA's Umami Burger was the best burger he'd ever had, pits Byron up against Umami and the verdict?

    "text": "Byron - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I love burgers. They are up there amongst my top three comfort foods. Recently I felt I should venture out in search of burger heaven. Following the footsteps of my London bible Time Out, I decided to go on my own personal quest to find the BEST burger in London, or at least have a pretty good go at it After an evening showing of A Christmas Carol at the IMAX Cinema (fantastic 3-D feature!), a bunch of friends and I decided to go to Byron's newly opened branch in Soho's Wardour St. It was after 10pm when we arrived, and we were lucky to find a couple of tables to accommodate our large group of ten. We were soon greeted by a delightful Australian chap called Kristian (with a K!), who looked after us throughout the evening. He was one of the friendliest guys I have ever met - brimming with positive energy and enthusiasm (well past 10 in the evening!), Kristian was faultless and made our meal at Byron memorable. My first impressions were excellent \u00a0in addition to the excellent service, I loved the industrial look of the place, the exposed bricks painted white, the open plan kitchen, the video playing against the white wall, and the understated elegance of the decor. The simplicity of their menu was also rather reassuring. All hamburgers are cooked medium and are served with lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle and mayo only. Burger options are Classic 6oz hamburger \u00a36.25, Cheeseburger (choice of Cheddar/Monterey Jack/Blue Cheese/Gruyere) \u00a37.25, Byron (dry cured bacon, mature cheddar, Byron sauce) \u00a38.50, Skinny (bun-free with salad only) \u00a37, Chicken \u00a38.25 or Veggie (grilled Portobello mushroom, roast red pepper, goat's cheese, aioli, and baby spinach) \u00a37.50. And that is it. Dr G ordered the Cheeseburger with Gruyere while I went for the Byron burger, as most of my friends. Byron's burger size is just about right \u00a0I love grabbing my burger with both hands, never really getting my head round using a knife and fork as in GBK (I love GBK too though). As I bit through my burger I found it to be perfectly cooked and deliciously charred, the meat was flavoursome, fresh and still pink in the middle, and the bun just right, showing some lovely griddle marks. My feelings were echoed across the table, my fellow diners were ecstatic with their own choices, and having dragged them all the way from Waterloo, I was also very happy and relieved! We also ordered various portions of French Fries \u00a32.75, Proper Olives \u00a32.75 (the greenest I have ever seen), Homemade Skin on Chips \u00a33, and their sensational Courgette Fries \u00a33, the best of them all and a must on any visits to Byron. Wines are categorised into Good, Better, Great and Best, and prices range from \u00a313.50 (Good) to \u00a321 (Best). We ordered their Good white (a South African Chenin Blanc) \u00a313.50 and also their Best red (a Californian Pinot Noir) \u00a321. They were both excellent, and I would happily have them again. Tap water was provided unprompted in beautiful French style carafes and was constantly topped up. This is rare in West End restaurants and is highly commendable. Verdict \u00a0my newly favourite burger joint in London (sorry GBK!), serving no fuss but perfectly executed burgers, delicious courgette fries and chips at average prices. Excellent and personable service, beautiful decor and central location make Byron one of the best quality & value restaurants in Soho.",

It beats all other burger chains which offer burgers that are certainly not ultimate and in my opinion each and every one of them could close now that Byron is becoming more and more widespread.Byron's burgers are really good for a reasonable price, something that is quite unique. I say reasonable because it certainly isn't cheap but I think it doesn't need to be in central London where paying up to 15 pounds for a hamburger has become the norm. I do value quality though and that's what Byron offers. A Byron burger (take it with their own sauce) is a safe choice but there are options to top it up with all kinds of ingredients too. Good chips finish it.Byron clearly instructs its staff well which leads to quite a rehearsed sales pitch at times. This is a letdown for me as the place doesn't need this over the top handling and in fact makes it feel more like a chain restaurant but I can deal with that. I come for the burgers and those are good.",

Sure, I told my friend. Why not just kick me in the shins, I thought.Then I looked at the menu online. Are you kidding me? This place serves A&W CREAM SODA? (If this review were an action movie, this is the part where the camera zooms in on the hero - me - as she growls 'Things...just got serious.')This place makes my immigrant heart beat big pumps of nostalgic home love. This chain was obviously made out of genuine affection for the way my people do diners. Since there are so many good overviews here, I'm just going to focus on the little things. These are the important details that show Byron know what they're doing:1. A&W CREAM SODA. (Really, it merits a repeat mention.) They also serve A&W Root Beer. And serve floats. You might as well be singing the Star Spangled Banner and looking through photographs from my childhood.2. Great quality dill pickle spears served with your burger. So often ignored here, but so very important.3. The fries are definitely fries, not chunky English chips.4. Do you know how many times some well-meaning someone directs me to 'an amazing new shake place' that is really just someone putting a straw into some weak soft serve? Step back. At Byron, you get real ice cream, real milk, blended and served in a real metal shake tumbler. I think the only thing that could make Byron feel more like home is if they added grilled cheese sandwiches to the menu. And gave me a hug.",

    "text": "It's pretty much like all the other Byron locations: these people know their hamburgers. I read a review that asked \"How many upscale designer Hamburger chains does the UK need?\" My answer as a hamburger lover would be: just one, as long as it does hamburgers right. And, until now, that small criterion to justify the existence of a chain had yet to be fulfilled: all the chains I have tried seemed to think a hamburger was about serving two balls of ground meat, set on fire until fully turned to coal, in a sourdough bun with a slice of pickle and a slice of tomato falling out from just bringing it to the table, and I am not exaggerating here. I have had to stop myself more than once from throwing some unbalanced stack of bone-dry inedibility back into a kitchen while screaming \"You call this a hamburger?\", and I am only slightly exaggerating there.Not at Byron. The meat patty is big, thick, round, and _flat,_ people, flat, so it will actually stay on the bun. The bun is soft fluffy bread that soaks up the juices from the tender meat. The meat will be served medium rare, which means it will actually be pink in the middle. And it will taste like real meat on real bread and be delicious. There are proper milkshakes to be had, thick and cold and creamy, oddly served in the metallic mixing beaker instead of in a tall glass with leftover in the beaker next to it, as is traditional in the US.It is spendy, though. The simple burger is simple, and adding tasty accessories to it racks up a bill fast. But it is a nice meal.One thing Byron gets totally wrong from a similar US experience: the chips aren't soggy, or under-, or over-done, like they would be in the US, where finding good chips merits perma-skywriting an arrow to the point of purchase. The chips are nice. As they should be.",

Even though I didn't actually have a burger. I've been meaning to come here for ages (seriously, how have I not had a Bryon Burger yet?) I popped here with Miss Alex because they kindly gave me a voucher for milkshakes. They were packed when we arrived (and the little gaggle of people at the door got very annoying, and rude, after a while). But the staff were polite despite being rushed off their feet and off we went with our milkshakes. I'm something of a milkshake expert (and pride myself on such a silly thing to be expert in) and I don't remember the last time I had one as good. Oreo was my favourite of the two (I think they forgot to put malt in the vanilla one, if they didn't, their malt isn't very good). I like the place, I want to have food there, I want more milkshakes. That they can get four stars when we didn't stay, and only had milkshakes, is impressive. I'm looking forward to going back and trying their food. It's about time, isn't it?",

Housed in the old Intrepid Fox pub the interior is airy and light, on the wall a projector is playing various short animations. I wish I could say better about the burger, it is definitely one of the better ones in London but it is not the best. I was going to give the place 3 stars but I added one on for the interior, the friendly staff and for the care they show their food, making sure to use the best produce. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good burger and they will cook it to perfection based on how you ask them to. I just expected... more I guess. The danger of having high expectations maybe. Good handmade meat patty, soft buns, just the right amount of lettuce. I will definitely go back to get a second opinion and after reading the reviews here I am curious about the chicken burger (I am normally not much for chicken on a burger but the description made me want to try it - thanks talia)",

Service was friendly. A full house of patrons when we came here on a Tuesday evening, although they said it's usually not this way. Has a good selection of craft beers. And the prices!!! Honestly this place serves up solid burger for only \u00a36.50 and it's 10000x better than a \u00a310 one somewhere else! The decor's interesting. I don't think I know how to describe it, but they have a huge white wall space where they project old black and white movies - sound off. Kitschy in a cool way?Mayo haters beware: they slather on some of it as the standard on the classic burger. Yuck =P (I'm no friend of mayo!)

As for Byron, we were very pleased with the quality, taste and service. The facility itself is very simplistic and meets basic needs. \u00a0Tables were packed tightly to accommodate maximum seating. Decor was simplistic and nothing to rave about; however, the burgers were very good... and let's face it, we cared more about the actual food than the restaurant decor. Menu was simple... No major theme burgers at all. \u00a0I had the cheeseburger with blue cheese with bacon... and it was quite tasty and satisfying!!! I also ordered a side orders of onion rings, fries, and zucchini fries to share with our family of 5... The onion rings were great... Similar to onion rings at a County Fair. \u00a0Let's say that my entire family were very happy with their food. They felt that it was a \"taste of America\", which is high praise considering we have been living in England for 17 months and have been disappointed many times at many pubs! The slam dunk for my kids was the A&W root beer and creme soda, which is usually not sold in UK \u00a0stores; hence its higher pricing, but I was glad to pay it for the satisfying grins on my kids' faces. \u00a0Service was \"service with a smile\"!

I grew up eating American-style burgers, and this was before Meatliquor existed (thank goodness they opened) so I was very excited to try this special. We waited for 20-25 minutes, and I ordered my burger medium rare. For starters, the bun was cold, and there was not char on the bun. Apparently an American-style burger bun equates to a supermarket-quality hot dog bun back home - the same quality/texture as a hot dog bun. The cheese was barely melted, and the burger wasn't even hot. Fries were okay. Nothing more to be said though. Not to mention my burger was overcooked.Gross burger, slow food, bad lunch experience.",

The chips were alright. Everything was pretty average. Byron nails it with the craft beer list (and the Byron Pale Ale, made specially for them by Camden Town Brewery, is particularly tasty), but they're small portions for the \u00a34-5 you'll pay for them. I wanted the burger to be better so that I could come here again when I just want a quick and yummy burger, but I'd probably skip it in the future. Of course, there's one now opening next door to my work, so I'll probably eat my words and many more burgers.",

The food is dependable as ever: I went for my favourite combination of the delicious 'veggie', Portobello mushroom & goats cheese-based burger and Oreo milkshake with Malt.Being the Soho branch, it's perhaps unsurprisingly the busiest Byron I've been to, with steady streams of new customers entering the branch. Unfortunately this translated into somewhat overattentive servers: so often were they coming round to our table asking if we wanted anything (like, no doubt, the bill), I almost felt like asking them if they wanted to join us. Thus, though the food was as good as ever, this branch loses a star next to its sister branches.",

I am a big fan of the interior here. Secondly, the staff is always unfailingly helpful (this seems to be a constant at every Byron location). Now, the food and drink. The quality of the burgers is consistently excellent. Meat is always tasty and cooked as requested (medium rare is how you want it). Adding bacon is never an issue and the sides are all chuffing excellent as well (I'm particularly fond of the onion rings and courgette fries). During one of my recent visits there was an error with the check (we were charged for a beer we didn't have). The staff made no fuss and promptly took it off \u00a0and presented us with the correct check. Which leads me to drinks: Byron's house lager is rather excellent. It's nice and refreshing. Similarly, the banoffee milkshake, while very rich is really really good. All in all, for a chain restaurant, they have managed to keep the quality up, despite having a lot of branches. That alone is pretty impressive.",

This restaurant is in the Piccadilly area of London for a high-end retail shopping here was just down an alleyway or small street. Apparently the owner is Korean and was inspired by the fantastic New York burgers. Definitely six stars on a five star rating!",

Where can you take them? \"I don't eat fish.\" \"I don't like curries.\" \"Umm, I can't eat a pie.\" \"No spicy food, please.\" After you beat them senseless, you realize... burgers. Simple, American food that practically everyone enjoys. Well, anyone who eats meat.Byron's has a simple enough menu of burgers with assorted cheeses, as well chicken and veggie options. Humorously, they offer a \"Royal with Cheese\" as well. Everything's cooked medium unless you ask, but when you do they'll cheerfully take it off the grill early or leave it on longer, depending on how you want your meat.Speaking of grill, the kitchen is open. I like that. I like being able to see what's going on with the food I'm about to consume. It was nice and clean.Salads too, though my Yorkshire friend would say \"Salad is what the food eats.\" Do have the skin-on chips, which are cut into random sized bits that go well with a splotch of ketchup.Decent price. Two burgers, two sides of fries, two beers, \u00a330.If you're looking to add some sugar to all that grease and protein, try the \"Knickerbocker Glory\". Our neighboring table had one of these ice cream monstrosities. No, he didn't share. He. Ate. It. By. Himself.",

Unfortunately, I ended up getting sick, even after the waitress assured me that she had a friend who was gluten free and ate there all the time.I won't be back, but if you don't have any food allergies and you're looking for a burger place with a fun atmosphere, I'd recommend checking it out!",

I've had a thousand of them in the U.S. too. So I guess if you can't find burgers in London, maybe this would be considered good. I didn't really want to come here. I didn't fly to London to eat burgers but a friend seemed very passionate about it. I will say their fries were super good, well salted and crispy. I had a can of Camden Halls at our waitresses recommendation. It was OK. I'm not a beer aficionado. I think it's probably a bit watery/flavorless for people who enjoy hoppy beer. For me it was good enough and I enjoy trying local beer. This was a good spot to grab late night eats in a fun and happening part of London. The waitress was very cool and I had great conversation with an old friend but thats it. This cannot be the best burger in London and not worth a stop for an American. You're up to your ears in burgers in the U.S. Go eat some Fish and Chips, I wish I had.",

Initially we were headed to Honest Burger (one of my favourites for veggie burgers) but the wait was at least an hour so we immediately turned around and opted for Byron. And that's what's great about Byron - it's reliable. It's never empty but there always seems to be one last table free, just when you need it. The food is also pretty good, so you know you can't go wrong. Their veggie burger is consistently good, across all chains and as far as I remember from my carnivorous days, the blue cheese burger was lush. We were served by a very nice and friendly waiter and the drinks were great, too. I had a lemonade (gotta love a restaurant that does decent lemonade) and the boyfriend had a can of pale ale that even I enjoyed. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because Byron's veggie burgers aren't my favourite, but it doesn't mean that they're not delicious. So when you don't know where to head for a dinner in a busy part of London - check out Byron.",

    "text": "To preface, my partner and I come from Los Angeles, CA where burger competition is fierce. \u00a0While on vacation, we saw this establishment while waiting for Flat Iron right across the street. \u00a0We were curious on how Londoners like their burgers so we decided to try it out.It was decently busy on a Sunday night but no wait so we were grateful. \u00a0Service was great and location is stellar.We ordered the Old Smokey, Clucky, and the Halloumi fries..\u00a310 (13.8 USD) Old Smokey Burger: Bland. Very bland. Almost as if the cook left the salt out entirely. \u00a0The buns were toasted but the quality of bread tasted pretty cheap. \u00a0The meat itself was greasy and tasteless because of the total lack of salt. \u00a0No amount of sauce could save the lack of seasoning on this burger. \u00a0For \u00a310 I expected a gourmet burger but overall it couldn't even compare to a Five Guys/Shake Shack burger (fast casual burger chains with ~\u00a36 burgers). \u00a0It is an absolute sin not to season your burger, especially for one that costs as much as this. \u00a0Shame.\u00a35 (7 USD) Halloumi Fries:The fried cheese sticks came out crispy and hot. \u00a0Good.\u00a310.50 (14.50 USD) Clucky: Seeing a trend here. \u00a0The fried batter was unseasoned, and the chicken was tasteless and dry. \u00a0I don't think they brined the chicken prior to frying so the chicken was DRY and bland. \u00a0However, the guacamole was surprisingly decent. \u00a0Again for \u00a310.50 sandwich, I expected much much more.Total for dinner including service: \u00a340 (55.5 USD) for burgers and cheese friesThis is really disappointing to write since I really wanted to like the place. \u00a0From the outside, the kitchen looked professional and the atmosphere felt welcoming. \u00a0After my disappointing dinner I looked up this restaurant and apparently they are undergoing some financial problems. \u00a0I am not writing this review to attack Byron, I just want this place to learn and improve. \u00a0The manager and head chef should taste their food now and then to ensure quality (unless they think what they are currently outputting is fine, then that is a whole different issue). \u00a0I bet Byron has a hard time retaining customers. \u00a0Pay attention to the food! \u00a0It is the most crucial element of a restaurant.",

    "text": "While wondering through London, me and some friends were getting hungry and stumbled across this place. \u00a0Luckily we got in just before the rush. \u00a0This place is quite small and clearly gets very busy around lunch time but we were fortunate. \u00a0Shortly after we arrived there was a bit of a queue starting to form, but like I said, I think we timed it just right.There were five of us and we all had to fit around a table that was clearly meant for four, so on one side of the table it was a little bit of a squeeze, but because we were hungry we really didn't mind. \u00a0Also as the place was quite small and in a fairly busy area, it was a little bit loud but when you're talking to your friends, you soon overlook it.We were served more or less straight away and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. \u00a0I think it was about 15-20 minutes which given the amount of people they had in, I didn't think was that bad. \u00a0There was a good selection of food to choose from but most of us when for burgers.I must admit I'm not a big food person, and usually go for more plain foods, but I have to say that the burger I had here was by far, the best burger I've ever had. \u00a0It was amazing! \u00a0In fact just sitting here thinking about it makes me want to go back there right this second to get another one. \u00a0I don't think I can say much more about it. \u00a0None of us had been here before and everyone was saying more or less the same. \u00a0The chips that we had with it were ok, but the burger just stole the show. \u00a0Most people will read this and probably say, 'you don't know what you're talking about, there are much better burgers out there!', and they may be right, but for someone like me who just likes a nice, juicy, tasty, plain burger; this place ticks all the boxes.And on top of that, the price was really reasonable so I can't complain there. I think the only thing that let the place down a little was the building/facilities, but its London, so theres not much you can do there. \u00a0But overall, really happy we stopped here for lunch. \u00a0Will defiantly go back again.",

    "text": "Independence Day in enemy territory, and we needed to get something American. My friend, who is British but married to an American, suggested that we go here for a good ol' burger. He didn't disappoint!The place was packed on a Saturday evening at 8:30, but the establishment has plenty of space with a downstairs dining area in addition to the ground level. I ordered the Byron burger with french fries, and a Byron pale ale. The burger was what you expect from a burger joint - juicy and thick patty, crispy bacon, melted cheese, and soft buns. The fries are in between thick cut and string fries, which I loved as I felt it an appropriate balance between fry and potatoes. I also judge a burger joint by how heavy I feel after, and I felt great throughout the rest of the evening, which speaks to the quality of Byron as well. I also ordered the BBQ sauce - keeping in theme with Independence Day - and thought it was a notch too sweet and tangy. Nonetheless, great and prompt service and the food definitely merits the Byron 4 stars.",

The prices are decent with quite a lot of choices on sides other than burgers, but it was a disappointment that they ran out of all chicken wings! So we ordered two cheeseburgers, caesar salad, courgette fries and cheese fries. The wait was quite long, about half an hour to fourty minutes. The staff were nice but not very attentive probably because they were too busy serving up the dishes, so it took me about ten mins to ask for some mayo even though we sat in the middle of the restaurant... by that time both our fries were slightly cold, and the courgette fries had a pretty thick batter on which I can't help thinking they aren't very fresh due to the temperature and texture of the courgette. My burger patty wasn't particularly juicy and there is a lack of beef flavour in the meat, otherwise the bun and sauces are quite nice. The caesar salad was in a bit of a mess, with an uneven distribution of dressing, leaves chopped into different sizes and the vegetables were not fresh and soggy. The croutons were my favourite because they were made of cubed burger buns which I though was rather special with its original butter-baked flavour as well. My partner's burger was a lot juicier, so maybe there is an inconsistency in the production of these dishes.",
