Our dinner at Boundary was in the basement dining room which was modern and bustling without being overly loud. If there's a rooftop dining area it escaped our notice.The food was nice enough but it took its time in getting out to us - the wait staff was visibly busy throughout our dinner. The hosts were very pleasant, as was the sommelier but the waiters seemed like they had better things to do than talk to us.Boundary is definitely the nicest dining room in the area, but the unremarkable food and below-par service won't be luring us back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Go here just for the view. It's a perfect picturesque just-about-360 degree panorama of the London skyline, lots of clouds, and the occasional airplane. The comfy couches and the wool blankets are pretty sweet too. And even though it's a bit annoying at first that they charge 2 quid for bread and olive oil, it's a big basket of four different types of really good bread, one stuffed with a peppery olive tapenade, and a plate of good spicy olive oil. Overall it's an amazing space although the whole atmosphere can at times verge on pretentiousness. It's not their fault, but you know there's always a high likelihood of douchebaggery at swanky rooftop bars, kind of like the dude with the expensive sunglasses, overly styled hair, and artfully unbuttoned shirt reclining creepily by himself along a sofabed.But the place itself is beautifully designed and spectacular in good weather. Avoid the d-bag and you should have a great time.",

    "text": "For pics: roastedmontreal.blogspot\u2026  I had read snippets about The Boundary here and there and was excited to give it a try. I thought it was a Conran restaurant, but that's only half true. It's part of the Prescott & Conran group of companies which according to The Boundary website is '...a joint venture between Terence Conran, Vicki Conran and Peter Prescott.' However, it's still got the Conran name attached and is a swish place as you would expect. It's located on Redchurch Street which is in the middle of grotty but trendy Shoreditch. Somehow, Redchurch Street has turned itself into a bit of a destination with design stores, high end clothing shops, and a variety of other random stores selling all sorts of luxury stuff you don't really need. I wonder how all these expensive shops will fare over the long term. Our group of five arrived somewhat lost at the reception of The Boundary (which is also a hotel) where our name was taken and we were directed to the elevator. Riding in an elevator to a restaurant in the basement could be a bit of a downer, but instead it only heightened the excitement and when the doors opened we were not disappointed. Once seated the service was excellent and despite our many many questions, the waiter was very accommodating. I started with the Cornish Crab (GBP 12) which was excellent. Two members of our group had fresh oysters. I am no oyster fan, but I was told they were spot on. My main of Sea Bass and Shrimps (GBP 22) was stunning and I was very pleased. My friends tried the veal and the steak. Everyone was enamored with the restaurant - the service, the scenery and the food. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a destination restaurant. roastedmontreal.blogspot\u2026",

    "text": "A good friend took me to the rooftop bar on a Wednesday night (7pm).So impressed by it, was I - great views, a little bit decadent, good elderflower cocktails, swift service - that I subsequently took my in-town-for-the-weekend friend on the following weekend. The two visits, in less than a week, could not have been more different. On the Wednesday, the staff were friendly, efficient & helpful - if somewhat judgemental about the speed of our drinks ordering! There was a small queue to get in but everything was handled well. So all in all, I didn't mind the expense and came away suitably impressed. On the Saturday we queued for 30mins, managing to just get in before they closed the doors at 9pm, only to get up to the roof and see several tables + chairs free. And to think some people had queued for 90mins and some had left after being told by reception that there was no point in them queuing!! It became obvious that the downstairs reception rely on a sporadic telephone chat with the rooftop manager, in order to determine availability.The same manager appears to be doing this whilst dishing out menus, serving drinks, dealing with staff & customers...etc etc Perhaps they were short-staffed on Saturday? Unfortunately we were then subjected to service by the unfriendliest waitress ever. I had to ask her 3 times for drinks and then felt guilty for bothering her. And it wasn't just us - a chap on the neighbouring table complained to the manager. We paid \u00a322 for carafe of Planters Punch. Stick to glasses, else it's a case of \"can we have some cocktail with our ice please?\" The waitress toured the tables at around 9.30pm advising all that the kitchen was closing soon. We made a last minute request for snacks, which was a mistake - we got the been-out-all-day, bottom-of-the-pan dregs.I begrudged the service charge and did not leave a tip. The views were, of course, great on both evenings. Would I go again? Maybe. But not on a Saturday.",

    "text": "Conran in back in the restaurant business. And it's good to have him back. Opposite the uber trendy Shoreditch House this new restaurant popped up a few weeks ago. Turns out it has a lovely deli, cafe, rooftop venue and designer hotel rooms available too. But I just ate in the main restaurant and it was a pleasure. The focus is on seasonal classic English and French dishes. I had to go for the daily special, each day there is a different option from the rotisserie although the chicken is available any day. The day I was there the special was a Coulibiac, somthing I have never come across before. It was delicious though, essentially a salmon dish in a giant brioche. The staff were attentive and knowledgable, in fact our sommelier decanted our red wine as apparently it was a little colder then she would have liked it. It's rare to find that level of service these days. My friends steak au poivre was melt in the mouth gastro-fest. The sides and deserts were all spot on. Add in the lovely crisp white linen and proper sized cutlery along with silver salvers all over the walls and it makes it a great place to go for a celebratory night out. A little pricey for a casual dinner but well worth it for a special ocassion. Check out the numerous bits of art work across the building too, from the contemporary mural all the way through the staircases to the large installation pieces. I didn't love the odd astronomy patterned lighting panels in the main dining room but how much time do you spend staring upwards anyway. A very pleasant relaxed evening, I will definitely be going back here.",

We got lucky with the weather on a Tues evening and this place was perfect for showing off London to some of our out of town mates. Read some of the reviews and was a bit worried it might be a bit pretentious e.g. queues for the sake of queuing etc (and there was a tiny bit of that, like 2 mins while they sorted out a table for us - not complaining!). Got upstairs and it was buzzing and lively, yet still fairly relaxed - did not feel any of that hip pretentiousness that i read from some other reviews. The waitstaff were friendly and attentive, and i didn't think the drinks were outrageously priced or anything - completely reasonable for a nice space and brilliant view, with a really nice chilled crowd to boot. A fab place for a drink when you're feeling like something special and a bit more chic than your local pub, and to catch a nice sunset over east London. Can imagine getting a spot on the weekends could be a bit of a challenge so go mid-week if you can knock off work a bit early!",

I didn't know what to expect and we were immediately surprised that the main restaurant is in the basement. It is an amazing space though and has enough light streaming in from the pavement skylights, wasn't sure about some of the decoration though. We headed for the roast and it was amazing, my Lamb was one of the best I have eaten, and a really generous portion of roasties and vedge. Some of the service was a bit restrained and found it pretty hard to get a smile out of our main waiter, but generally a really great meal and experience. Would definitely go again but would make a route for the roof garden when it's finished for summer.",

Go, take someone special, wrap up in blankets and drink till the sun goes down over your heads. If you can bring homemade cookies, I highly recommend it. In fact, they ought to just add a cookie plate to the menu. Apparently you can't get hide or hair in here in summer, so just come in the winter like us ;-)",

It was a lovely sunny evening and we were hoping to have pre dinner drinks on the roof terrace however, upon arrival we were told that although we had booked the restaurant, we had to book the roof terrace separately for pre dinner drinks (which comes at an additional deposit charge). Nevertheless we went down and had a drink in the bar. The service was really good and everyone was very polite. The beef dish that I had was amazing but my boyfriend and his dad were a little disappointed with their choice (guinea fowl). I would say this is somewhere to go as a treat (birthday/ anniversary) as it is on the expensive side but definitely worth it- I can highly recommend the beef and the prosecco which went down well and the selection of puddings and cheeses is incredibly displayed!",

The lamb was quite delicious, but it was really nothing special. The Bouillabaisse was a bit blend and I was glad that wasn't my main dish. The food was meh, but the rooftop was quite nice and I can see it being a very popular spot in a nice summer evening.",

Friends and I donned our best comfortable summery frocks, and sipped sangria in the sun, and yes, I got sunburned.It was very nice, relaxing and quiet, and most of the tables were simply enjoying the fine views and weather as we were. There's both a covered and uncovered area, which is nice for when the weather doesn't agree as well as it did when I was there. There's also a great serving staff, lounging tables and seated tables, and basically everything you might need for various times of day and weather and occasions.The location is great, just a few minutes from Shoreditch High Street. That means, it's also a great place to start afternoon drinking, and carry on into the evening with the wide array of options in the area.All in all, a great rooftop bar, and I really enjoyed in being my first one of the season. Definitely worth a drink or two if you're on the east side on a sunny day.",

I've been here for the basement bar and the rooftop bar, but it is actually a boutique hotel and I hear that the restaurant downstairs quite nice too (and you can also have brunch on the rooftop apparently). The basement bar is elegant and intimate, good for a catch up drink with a friend, but the time we were there, there was a loud drunk family reunion going on, which was not ideal. The rooftop is a place you'd have to queue up for on a clear weekend night, as they seat you at a table with large weathered wooden chairs, like the type you might see at a beach. There are also nice fires around to keep warm. I went last night for an event and they have a glass enclosed indoor space as well, which was divided between 2 events and could fit 20-30 people on each side. It wasn't a warm day but the outdoor space didn't have very many guests, so I think it wouldn't be too hard to get in on a weeknight. I think this is the classier version of Queen of Hoxton around the corner, where you would come after work when you want to sit at a table instead of on the fake grass at QoH.",

Or something.The seating hostess spots us and we inquire, \"this is the rooftop bar right?\" She gives us a look like we just asked if we could eat her babies. I guess it was sort of obvious where we were but after so many misdirections, we were in sort of a confused haze. Whatever, just seat us already and give me beveraaaages.We decide to also order food since there was seating and several things on the menu looked intriguing. Yes, it's overpriced BS that I could cook at home and yes, we still ordered it anywaaay. But our waitress totally gave us the third degree about all our food choices. I wanted the strawberries and cream and the ratatouille. THEN THIS EXCHANGE HAPPENED:waitress: wait what?me: yes, strawberries and cream and I guess also ratatouille.her: don't you want some real food to eat?me: well it's ok, I will just be eating thatCUE HER GIVING ME THE BIGGEST STINK EYE FACE EVERher: .... ok so which do you want to come out first?me: I guess what ever is ready first?her: you're sitting right by the kitchen, IT WILL BE READY WHEN YOU ORDER ITme: ...ok I guess bring them out in whatever order is most convenient for you?her: I'm not the one who wants these things, it's you who ordered them.??????????????????????????????SORRY WHAT? Everything was just downhill from there. The other patrons were nice but service here is weird. The food is mediocre. The cocktails were OK. Well Boundary, GOODBYE FOREVER.",

Yes folks I have knocked off a star because this place is designed for the \u00a0masses who work from home or are too damn wealthy to work. Essentially, you can't get a seat for the evening unless you get here in the lull after lunch and spend your whole afternoon drinking cocktails. Well okay, maybe you don't need to order cocktails but you will need to order something.They don't take bookings you see, and as a result, you end up rushing out of work to get here and desperately queuing for over and hour. Even then you won't be guaranteed a seat, it could just be a ledge that they have thrown a blanket on top of. Saying that, their cocktails are divine and I do still love this place, I just wish everyone else didn't too!",

    "text": "Well hopefully yelp will allow me to add a separate listing for the rooftop restaurant as it is very very different from Albion and presumably a world apart from the subterranean restaurant (which I haven't yet been to).Seeing the weather reports were saying sunny we got there early, at 12.15, and grabbed ourselves a big outside table. \u00a0The location is just about perfect, high up, next to Shoreditch House, but with a more comfortable lounging area. \u00a0You sit and look out over the city in a style of restaurant which reminds me of the rooftop scene in Istanbul. \u00a0It is a grill. \u00a0Which on a sunny day means a chunk of steak, a slab of fish or a side of chicken. \u00a0Pretty much perfect. \u00a0The drinks are also summer time classics. \u00a0They have a few jugs of cocktails and we started on the sangrias and kept them flowing whilst we applied the suncream.After a lot of distraction on the excellent booze choices we finally started on the food. \u00a0It was what it was meant to be; grilled food done well. My poussin was the perfect accompaniment to the sunburn I didn't manage to avoid. However, it is merely well done grilled food, don't expect to experience something revolutionary.The place was great and the staff were charming. The clientele is, so far, a bit of a hodge podge. \u00a0I will be quite interested to see if it turns into a non Shoreditch House kind of a place or a City escape. \u00a0Whatever, go now.",

The caf\u00e9 is on the corner called Albion and the hotel, Boundary, has a fantastic roof bar, which is great to visit on the two weeks of summer London receives each year.",

If you are looking for a cheap eat then don't go. However if you don't mind pay for quality then give it a try. It's typically Conran: excelllent service, someillers, great wine and geat food but you pay through the nose. As I said the food is top notch. My friend is a chef and the first time I went was the opening night. We got 50% off and special treatment. That night would have been 5/5 stars. The food was excellent. I had a rare steak which had been marinated in pepper and dijion. The meat was fantastic and it was cooked to perfection. The somellier recommended some nice wine and we had a great evening. I returned another time with my parents and was not disappointed. Of course we payed twice the price, but the food and service was excellent again. If you don't mid shelling out, then you'll have a great time here.",

Also, if it's windy, your food is gonna get cold fast, that just comes with the Al Fresco territory, not a knock on the establishment. The staff didn't seem very coordinated nor super smiley, although the chilly temperature at the time could take the happiness from a few people.

Boundary is quite a visual stunner once you enter, but it even manages to keep the spirits up during a dinner. A Friday night dinner service wasn't packed, but well-visited. Service was flawless - very helpful and non-fussy sommelier (and his choice was perfect), non-intrusive waiting staff, friendly smiles and nods both when entering and exiting the dining room. Now to the nosh: helps if you eat meat, or better still, if you crave meat. Following this unofficial motto, I ordered steak tartare for starter and filet for main - like the service, it was non-fussy but flawless (in a good sense). Pistachio souffle was a stunner. My dinner companion also raved about her lamb roast.Perfect place for a date. Tucked into the walls are little semi-booths, where you sit fairly close and next to your companion, rather than opposite. I wasn't actually on a date, but the table to our left understood the charms of Boundary: judging from a ring being exchanged there at some point during the evening, there was engagement written all over them ...",

All but the saucissons were delicious - the bruschetta in particular was really moreish. The choice of mains was grilled cod or grilled ribeye - both we really generous sized and came with fries, couscous and salad to share. I ordered the rib eye which was really well cooked with almost a barbecued type flavour.Desserts were creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse - both were very rich with a great flavour.

For my boyfriend's birthday I made sure we got there before sunset, and we were lucky enough to score the seats right in the corner overlooking the city.The cocktails were yummy, and the only thing that left a sour taste was the confusion around whether I could continue my tab in the basement restaurant. I had already been asked to pay \u00a3150 deposit to ensure I didn't just stay in the rooftop and go back on my word of going downstairs. I would recommend others don't bother doing this as the restaurant was only at 30% capacity on a Thursday evening and so you don't necessarily need to book ahead.The food was world-class, and we started with the scallops and the crab. Combining the scallops with pomegranate was a fab idea, it remains one of my favourite dishes I've ever had! Both our mains were beautifully done as well.The sommelier was outstanding, offering us a choice of two white wines based on the dishes we chose.I'll definitely be returning.",

Three of us ate and we all had something different. \u00a0Bream, Club sandwich and Chicken Skewers. \u00a0I'll talk about mine, although the Club sandwich appeared to be very heavily......bread.The Chicken Skewers were bland and the Tzatziki was so overwhelmingly garlicky, it just made the dish regretful. \u00a0Can't say much more than about it really.This place seems like a grown up Shoreditch House which means, poor beer choices, second class views and mediocre food at a price. \u00a0Would I come here again? \u00a0Probably not. \u00a0Do I regret coming, not really.",

Shoreditch seems to be constantly evolving so there are seemingly new places every time I visit. Forge & Co was a new place I spotted quickly after checking into my new digs. Dining alone can be a bit awkward I guess but I really don't mind cause I do it frequently enough during my travels for work. Nonetheless the hostess had me wait for what seemed an unnecessary length of time for my table (as several were open) but thankfully the manager proactively looked after me and promptly got me a drink so I didn't have to look like a dufus sitting by myself. \u00a0 Being Sunday in England I ordered the roast and it was freaking fantastic! \u00a0The manager picked out a great glass of wine off the menu and I enjoyed a thoroughly enjoyable dinner. This place is quite airy and comfortable with long communal tables combined with small tables as well as comfortable couches on one end. The food was great and it really did feel like a cool neighborhood place (albeit it's a pretty hip neighborhood to begin with). \u00a0You should definitely check this place out if you are anywhere near the area. I would imagine it would be a great place to snag some drinks and food if you've been shopping at the nearby trendy shops as well.",

I had the lobster ravioli and it was amazing. They really didn't skimp on the lobster! My girlfriend had the souffl\u00e9 and she said that was amazing too. The mains were... Fine. We both kind of agreed that they were good but not great. I had the chicken, it was good. She had the fish stew. It wasn't very stewy to be honest!Dessert was pretty good. The cheese was awesome, as was the cheese lady. The profiteroles were amazing too, though they took a while to come! Service was good, they were really friendly. We were expecting particularly bad service given some of the reviews, but it was fine, good even! The front desk lady was particularly unpleasant, but once you're past her you're home free! Wine was... Extensive! I won't comment further, as I'll be honest I have no idea. Whiskey was a decent range and a good price though! I'd probably pop in if you haven't been, but I probably won't return, there's too much choice in this price range and generally I go too infrequently and it wasn't good enough for a round two!",

It happened to start raining that day and the waiter didn't seem to think it was a good idea to warn guest that seating inside was not available until we had waited 30 minutes for our table. Rating is strictly according to service. Once we were showed to our rainy table outside, we immediately left. However, a nice bar downstairs did remind me of a fancy speakeasy like vibe which could make for a good location for drinks with friends or coworkers after work. Seemed to have a fairly good selection of scotch and whiskey as well.",

Not the most informal of spaces, it caters more to a suited and booted crowd, so is nice for a first date to impress. The cocktail list is heavy on the classics with the concept being around the American style hotel bar. We had dry martinis, French 57 and champs. All of which were fantastic and prepared by a female bartender. Girl Power I say, it is good to see womenfolk behind the bar.",

    "text": "(Review is for the Rooftop Bar)In a Nutshell: The Arguable Crown Jewel of Rooftop Bars in East LondonI went on a whim with a few friends Saturday evening in early May, and we were all glad we visited. \u00a0The rooftop is modern and chic, the view not exactly tantamount to Duck & Waffle or Paramount, yet still nice enough. \u00a0The loungey seating felt like VIP sections in a trendy club (but in a good way) and I have no complaints with the service. \u00a0I'm a stickler for background music, and the lounge/deep house soundtrack gets a thumbs up.An open-air year-round rooftop bar doesn't sound like the best strategy within UK's bipolar weather, but they have \"designer heaters\" for each section and will even provide blankets should you want to brave the cold. \u00a0Our group definitely used both amenities, because London clearly doesn't start getting warm at night until late July. \u00a0 We ordered a pitcher to share for 4. \u00a0The Summer Garden (Ketel One Citroen vodka, berneroy calvados, benedictine, lemonade) was refreshing, though at \u00a325 was not cheap. \u00a0It proved itself to be one of those \"silent killer\" cocktails that creeps on you later in the evening...which I don't mind :)It's a great place to start a spiffy/posh night out on the East End; I will definitely return!Golden Tip: There's not a lot of standing/solo people, as it all appears to be sectional seating...come with a group to maximize the experience!",

After those came out again we had a hard time getting anyone's attention to order dinner and when we finally did they told us the kitchen closed 30 mins ago. It would have been nice for someone to have let us know. The waiter that took our first order never showed up the entire time to check on us and we had to walk up to him to ask him for the check.

    "text": "Came here for a company function a couple days ago, we had the corner of the rooftop bar on a beautiful slightly cloudy night.First off. The rooftop is absolutely beautiful. We came here with about an hour left of light - so watching the sun set over the city as the city lights came on was very surreal. Pair that with a 13 degree night and a Peroni, and you're set. They have an \"indoor\" section with sliding glass wall windows for open air exposure. There are also space heaters so you can have open air dining and not be freezing. The ceiling doubles as a vineyard, and I did see baby grapes growing along the ceiling. I thought that was a nice and charming touch. The noise level was modest, and you could carry on a conversation very easily without having to fight to be heard. There were sofas as well as plenty of standing room, the servers were nice and filled glasses before they were fully emptied. We had the usual beers & wine, along with some of their own cocktail mixtures. Their mojito-like drink was by far the best one they offered, with enough alcohol in there to make it a dangerous drink. We had finger food, and by far the fish cakes were the highlight of the night. I'm not sure if those are on the appetizer menu or not, but they were delicious.As I made my way to the exit, I saw that people sitting outside in the seats were huddled under blankets (I assume provided by the bar) as they enjoyed their champagne. Enjoying watching the stars with some champagne on a rooftop bar while watching the stars - sounds brilliant. Will definitely be back.",

The hostess downstairs told us that she could give us a table inside, but nothing was available outside. We were fine with that and went upstairs to the rooftop. It's a beautiful place, with an outside area full of comfy sofas and chairs and a covered area that is more like a restaurant dining room in a greenhouse. We were sat (inside) by the window with a great view over Dishoom. It was actually a little chilly to be sitting outside, so we were very happy inside. We had a good view of the kitchen and it was lovely and airy. The food was amazing, I had the burger (which wasn't actually called a burger on the menu, it was actually described as: \"Boundary Pan Bagnat - a Ni\u00e7oise-inspired sandwich with a flame-grilled beef patty, goat's cheese, roast vegetables and green salad\") and my friend had the muscles with the amazing bread basket. We shared a carafe of white wine that the waiter recommended. For pudding my friend had the mango and pineapple eclair (sooooo scrummy) and I had the ice cream, that was home made and a revelation in taste! We both had lovely coffees and in total, I think we were there for over two hours. What was really outstanding, was the service. Everyone was extremely attentive, friendly, warm and really made us feel welcome and looked after. I would heartily recommend a visit here.",
