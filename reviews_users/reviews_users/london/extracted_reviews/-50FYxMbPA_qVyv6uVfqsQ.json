Service was nearly flawless, just a little confusing at times.If you are looking for Chinese in London, go here.",

So from past experiences Royal China in London has always satisfied my cravings. Now that it has basically cornered the market in London with over 6 locations it has become mass market. I'm told that there is a main depot in zone 6 where all the dim sum is assembled and then shipped to the individual locations to be cooked. I didn't believe it until i tasted the dim sum and it tastes like the stuff i got from circle k or 7 eleven after a hard night at lkf or tst. Sorry London Royal China edges out most dim sum offerings in NY, but no where near Vancouver or Toronto standards - and for the price you'll be truly disappointed. True to the London experience - unfortunate. P.S the wait is horrendous 45 to 1hr no reservations, unless you are an insider (Cantonese).",

    "text": "In my opinion, this is the best place to get dim sum in the city. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very traditional- it is a huge, smart restaurant full of business men during the week and wealthy families from St John's Wood at the weekend. Like the other Royal China's in London (Baker Street, Queensway and another in Canary Wharf) when you enter the restaurant, you are given a ticket and told to wait in the somewhat cramped bar area until your number is called out. Once you are led to your table and put your jacket on the back of your chair, the waiter abruptly covers your coat with a seat cover. The speed in which they do this shows the discipline of the restaurant- it is very smart, almost corporate in its feel, with an army of efficient waiters on hand at all times.The dimsum is the freshest and best I have tasted outside of Hong Kong. Although the restaurant's main menu is significantly more expensive than many chinese restaurants and it is undoubtedly more elegant, the dimsum selection is no more expensive than your typical dimsum restaurant in Chinatown. There is nothing more expensive than 4 pounds on the menu, which is incredible considering the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything here is freshly made on the premises- none of the frozen rubbish you get in soho. Having eaten dimsum here, it is really hard to go back to eating the packaged, reheated variety you typically find in London.",

First of all, there was very little service during the meal--our water was not refilled, no one asked us how the food was, etc. The waitress brought us the wrong food item and then when the bill came, we were charged for both items. Finally, when we tried to pay at the end, we asked to pay the \"recommended tip\" in cash while the meal was put on our credit card. The manager, Eddy Ho, came over and started berating us, saying we MUST charge both the meal and tip \u00a0on the credit card. He REFUSED to let us pay the tip by cash. He said that if we charged the meal only on our credit card and paid the tip separately, we were not allowed to come back to the restaurant! It was unbelievable. I have never seen such complete lack of customer service in a manager. He obviously did not care about keeping customers (or there is some scam going on).",

The place was not even that busy. When we caught the waiters attention they just stare at us coldly and keep walking. Like I know it's not your department or area of responsibility but at least notify somebody we need assistance? Throughout the meal to ask for anything was sooo difficult because they kept ignoring. The check took about another 20 minutes because nobody cared serve us. Long story short. Service is too horrible.",

The tables can be comically big if you have less than 10 people, which was the case for us last Friday night.The food was great---some of the best Chinese you can get in London. I suggest getting the set menus (minimum of 2 people). It's a bit pricey but you get tons of food---like 4 or 5 dishes. The aromatic duck pancakes were great as was this spicy shrimp stir-fry. So why not 5 stars, well the service is horrible...not very friendly or attentive. We sat down at 930, and they were very very eager to rush us out before closing time.Last pointer -- avoid the cocktails---I had 2 different ones---both were disgusting at best.

We were there about 11:30; it filled up within the next fifteen minutes, and by the time we left, the queue was easily thirty-people deep. Their classics are spot on. We tried our usuals: har gao, char siu bao, lo pak ko, etc. However, we tried a braised pork and noodle dish that was underseasoned. The pork was also cooked within an inch of its life -- very tough. I think we'll stick with the basics, if we go back. It's definitely a younger, scene-ier crowd. Kind of like Yautcha, only cheaper. Worth a visit, if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Full post and photos @ thecattylife.com  Not to be confused with Royal China Club (its more expensive and less screaming-dimsum-orders-in-your-face sibling) Royal China has been a favourite amongst my pals for a while, but I don't know why I never went. Maybe it's the queues. Because if you show up any time after midday, there's a queue. Alternatively, you can be clever like my friends and send an anally-retentive-super-punctual friend (me) to get a ticket and commence the waiting. Used and abused, I tell you! Anyway, we ordered a bunch of the usual suspects \u00a0no wait, we diverted from the dim sum menu and ordered braised asparagus, which was perfectly crispy and soft (I realise them are oxymorons but they were crispy and soft, all at the same time) \u00a0har gow, siu mai, lo mai kai, wu kok, low bok gow, xiao long bao, and all kinds of cheong funs. Oh and a Singapore noodle because anally-retentive me had a craving. Everything was very good ~ fresh, tasty and light (as opposed to gruesomely glutnious which can be the norm at some substandard dim sum restaurants). I also remember that the law bok gow (turnip cake) was delicious with perfectly gelatinous consistency and beautifully fried a golden brown on each side. We also ordered I think five serves of cheong fun, which, well I think that means we liked it. Just a little bit. The desserts were a little bit bland but really, aren't we there for the dim sum?",

    "text": "While I still prefer the dim sum at New World (because they do the traditional cart service), I also have come to like Royal China...mostly because it feels a little more luxurious and who doesn't want to be pampered every once in a while.A few tips on this location though: - Especially on weekends, be prepared to wait for quite a while. When you arrive at the restaurant, they will probably give you a number. (Don't be surprised if they call a number that is greater than yours - they probably had not the right table-size ready yet.)- Don't order too much at once, but I suggest you order in small batches. That way, you can order according to your group's appetite and you also won't have all 12 dishes at once.- Make sure you order the Xiao Long Bao, as they do them really well here. (I suggest at least two orders ;-)As I mentioned in the beginning, this is the more luxurious dim-sum option, which also means that the price tag will be a little bit higher. So don't be surprised if you're losing a wad of cash...",

    "text": "One of the better places for dim sum in town and right across from Yelp London HQ! Although can be confusing, there's two royal china's, except one is the royal china club and posher. But I don't do posh dim sum. (I've never been to alan yau's enterprises either...)What's more, I usually yum cha with a bunch of people and we order the whole menu. This time, only the two of us- which means this is a dim sum challenge. Hah! Not really, my friend and I decided to opt for 7 small dishes. So we got some classics- shanghai buns, bbq pork buns, siu mai and taro croquettes. Then some specials, crabmeat siu mai, pumpkin tofu and crispy sesame roll. Surprisingly, since they're only small dishes, it was the right amount of food and it's the first time I've walked away from dim sum quite comfortable! Although that might also be the oil, it was much less oily than other places I frequent! But it is slightly more expensive! and don't forget the 13% service charge too!Weird thing though, it's very much geared towards an english speaking clientele, I MISS MY BALLOT SHEET ORDERING. I do, it's more antisocial but seriously, dim sum is very much about catching up and chinese people don't stop to order. we pencil what we want on the ballot order and give it to the staff. done. way more efficient too!To end this review, and in the oh-so wise words of david and goliath. You dim sum, you win some. :)",

That being said, my friend who was in a very lucid state backed me up re the mediocrity. I guess the dim sum here can be inconsistent which is weird because I feel that insofar as a category of food goes, this is something they should be able to replicate without minimal difficulty. I suspect it has to do with the fact that last time I came the place was packed so everything had to be continually made fresh. Whereas when we went on Saturday while far from empty, it wasn't full at the time we got there, so perhaps the food we were served had been chilling in a basket but also outside of the steamer for a while. (But then again, it was still warm and I mean every dim sum place does this so I really have no clue...)",

    "text": "What better food to eat after a night of partying (well actually two nights connected by day partying) than some solid dim sum? The wait on a Sunday at 1pm was insane, but after what seemed like an eternity, our group of 6 were finally ushered to a table that could have seated 12. Generally a long wait makes me think the place was a good choice, and Royal China was no exception. Tea and waters were served promptly and we asked our server if they could rapidly bring us a large plate of fried noodles while we perused the dim sum menu as we were all on the brink of starvation (2 slices of pizza the day before apparently does not sustain me very well...). They followed through and within 5 minutes there were delicious green onion & garlic noodles for the table. Royal China does not do traditional dim sum cart service, so you get to peruse the menu and pick your favorites rather than selecting items off of a cart and having no idea what you're about to consume. I started with some shrimp and scallion dumplings, which were amazing. The dumpling skin was the perfect amount of gooey but not chewy and the shrimp were barely cooked through, rendering some amazing texture. I followed with a hot & sour soup, which was decent, but nothing special. It had lots of veggies, tofu, egg, and meat in it, but the soup could have been a lot spicier. Lastly I went with the roasted pork buns, which were absolutely foodgasmic! Plenty of filling on the inside and hot steamy bun on the outside, I devoured all three in record time. I also tried some of the Chinese broccoli and the sweet & sour prawns one of my friends ordered. For dessert we ordered custard buns for everyone, which had a really light but lovely sweetness to them and finished off the meal well. For the bowl of soup, dumplings (3), buns (3), and tea my total came to be 15 GBP (including a 13% enforced service charge), which I found very reasonable for the quality of food that Royal China delivered. Be careful not to confuse this place with the Royal China Club located one block down on the same street (I'm speaking from experience).",

A very nice looking venue, lovely decor and was quite busy on a Friday night so just as well we had booked in advance. We were shown to our table and looked through the medium sized menu.. I did struggle to find a main course that appealed and didn't pull at my purse strings at the same time. For starters, we ordered salt and pepper prawns which were not on the menu but we asked the waitress (who looked incredibly bored). They were lovely and the chili added a nice kick. Also ordered the pork dumplings which were delicious and were in a spicy sauce (yum). Both were decent sized portions. For mains, we ordered vegetable crispy noodles and duck and prawn rice wrapped in lotus leaf. The noodles came in a tasty sauce and the rice tasted good with the spicy sauce from the pork dumplings otherwise would have been a bit bland and dry. Pleased and full with the meal, we saw the bill came with a 13% recommended service charge. Unimpressed with the service and the lack of emotion from the staff, we told the waiter we did not want to pay it..upon which he practically forced us to despite us pointing out that it was only recommended. Not wanting to create a scene, we paid the full amount which came up to just over \u00a322 each.Overall, it was a decent experience but I can't say I'll be visiting for dinner again but for lunch instead.",

Garnishing like the lotus leaf and softness of the glutinous rice bring quality detailing that differentiates the a 4 and 5-Star. Complementing the dim sum menu is not something you leave to chance. It has to provide the assurance that the dim sum variety is respectable and the other dishes are simply \"by-choice\". That's because the art of dim sum eating is really about moderation to be enjoyed gracefully with friends and family. Therefore other dishes simply add only colour. The grilled duck and friend chicken is very lovely and worth every bite. You must complement the dish with their authentic dried chilli paste (deep red in colour). Royal China is a must stop if you want wonderful and comforting Chinese food. For us, it's most definitely one of the top 5 Chinese restaurants in London.",

Royal China is a family type restaurant as everything you eat is served family style. However, it's appalling that a restaurant like this only has a single high chair. Only until we were over halfway done, did the high chair become available and even though one of the workers was not happy that his colleague gave it to us. Please invest in more high chairs! Thanks.",

    "text": "Like the original on Queensway, this Royal China is one or two notches above all its competitors in SoHo (in terms of food, d\u00e9cor, and service); it's also more authentic than the Mich-* Chinese in London (like Hakkasan or Yauatcha). However, it is at least one notch below its branch in Singapore: the menu here is shorter, the dishes less refined, and there is much less innovation. Proof that standards for Chinese restaurants (Asian in general) are much higher in HK and Singapore than in London. Some classic dim sum dishes are surprisingly sub-par (eg. liao long bao, cheung fun); there is too much rice at the bottom of the FuKien fried rice below the thin layer of proteins and sauces; meatballs stuffed with crabmeat are excellent, though. Still, one of the better Chinese eateries in England.",

If you put your name down a table will become available fairly soon (within 30 minutes) as the place is massive.We ordered an eclectic mix of food including steamed pork buns, fried dumplings, fried rice and won ton noodle soup. All of the food was delicious and cost less than \u00a3100 for four people. I've always struggled to find good Chinese food in London so I'm glad that I came to Royal China.",

Beef and ginger which was very smelly and chewy.And the starter which was fried squid was cold and again not fresh, we paid 150\u00a3 which was absolute waste of money and literally left the food on the table and will never come back or recommend that place.",

We ordered har gao, shrimp and chive dumplings, steamed pork buns, won ton noodle soup, shrimp fried rice, noodles with shrimp inside, fried dumplings, custard tarts, and lotus buns. Everything was delicious. Four adults and a two year old: the total was 95 pounds. Not horrible for a perfectly prepared meal and two hours of endless tea. Service was prompt. We waited 30 minutes for a table at 1:30pm on a Sunday. It seemed to get less crowded around 3. People who like good Chinese food need to come here asap.",

They were able to get the buns perfectly steamed, with the fillings perfectly stuffed and taste. I also had other dishes which were good including the Singapore Curry Noodles.The service was good and they were very prompt in serving me my dishes, giving me more tea and setting the bill when I was ready. They even gave me a lovely container to pack some of the takeaway steam roast pork burns because they were so good, i wanted to take some more with me for my flight home!",

The food is very good and having been forced to try other dim sum / yum cha options this is the only place that we always return to. The service is typical Chinese restaurant style.. seat, eat, get out with minimum fuss. They will only seat you when the whole group is here... Don't even bother to argue or negotiate with them as it will fall on deaf ears and they won't care if you take your business else where, it's not goin to effect them. The food is usually delivered within minutes of ordering and I've never had bad food here. The seating is functional and they can cater for couples or large groups. Price is very reasonable in comparison to other places similar but for a much higher standard of food.",

Chinese food here is quite mediocre for the most part. We had another dish that was like kungpao chicken or something and it didn't have enough veggies. For some bizarre reason restaurants here always give you a ton of meat with no veggies and too much salt. We had eggrolls for starters which were also pretty good.Unfortunately, it is on the pricey side for chinese food - 50GBP for 2 ppl but it is the price you pay in London. The service was fantastic, however. We actually did not have to ask our waiter to refill our water, which is a feat in itself.",

It's either a chain or ridiculously overpriced - either way the quality of food is pretty sub-standard.Popped in for a lunch meeting and had a variety of dim sum. It was ok - it was no Drunken Monkey. It seemed very popular for work lunches and a couple of large groups came in on an office lunchtime jolly.The service wasn't particularly friendly... in fact it was downright frosty. Brrr!I'm no vegetarian but I felt sorry for the fish and lobsters in the tank on the way in. They looked sad.I won't be hurrying back.I disagree with previous reviews, you CAN get fantastic Chinese cuisine in London. In fact you can get fantastic cuisine of any kind in London - it's a culinary capital - however, Royal China is not the place to find it.",
