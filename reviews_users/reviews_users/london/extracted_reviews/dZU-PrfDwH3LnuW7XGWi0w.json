Granted, I fulfilled an American stereotype and went for my go-tos: Palak paneer and chicken tikka. Even went for the appetizer dish (aka fatty fat fat fried goodie platter). What I got was a NOMPLOSION. Now, let me say this - I've had a ton of Indian food in multiple college towns, Indian neighborhoods and San Francisco. I thought I'd had it all. Nothing like this. It was incredibly fresh, tender and flavorful. Cheaper places usually throw a ton of spices at their dishes to hide the fact they may not be fresh, but Zaika had no need to cover up. It was perfect. Btw, service was rad. RAD. Look at me, the englishness is rubbing off.",

    "text": "I've been to two other Michelin-star restaurants and I believe they pale in comparison with Zaika. Zaika simply excels in service, quality of food and comfort and are humble about it. I visited Zaika with a couple of Indian friends and they too agree that the restaurant is a cut above any other Indian restaurant they've been to.\u00a0The restaurant is easy to locate just about 7 minutes walk away from High Street Kensington station, the entrance is big and pristine and you are greeted with a warm genuine smile by the hostess.The high walls are decorated with chandeliers and old fashioned framed Indian paintings, all the staff are approachable, the fresh rose on the table is huge and smells good, and when we were waiting on a friend to return from the toilet before eating the dish in front of us, the manager had the courtesy and wisdom to take the dish away to keep it heated in the kitchen before re-serving it to us once we were ready.\u00a0The Mirage mocktail I had was a true a delight with the lychee flavour coming through loud and clear.\u00a0My friends and I opted for the set menu which really showcased a satisfying and impressive range of food. First comes the\u00a0Pappad (Served with a duo of chutneys - Beetroot and fennel seed & Mango and mint). The poppadom was delicately thin and crispy whilst both dips were light and delicious enough for me to even eat them on their own. This amazed me to no end because I normally hate beetroot and I hate mint so the fact that they can make concoctions with both these ingredients and yet I love them is a real testament to how well they have been incorporated in a positive way. Next was an appetiser with a compound of chickpeas, chicken, watercress and mint sauce - once again I was dazzled by how much I loved this mint sauce despite hating mint, the chickpeas where noticeably fresh and tasty and the chicken was cooked tender. The third appetiser was just quality on a plate; simply a tiger prawn with a sheekh lamb kebab together with a strip of pepper sauce and a strip of mint sauce yet sublime in every aspect. The tiger prawn was quite possibly the most juicy and tasty prawn I have ever had , the lamb was succulent and beautifully seasoned and the sauces were a perfect complement to a perfect dish.The appetisers are already enough to surpass expectations and fill you up and then come the mains: baby aubergine tossed with freshly ground spices, yellow lentils with ginger, tomato and fresh coriander, truffle naan, chicken curry, lamb curry and Pulao rice. Normally at this point in a review I would pick at the good and bad points of each offering but I simply cannot fault any of the dishes Zaika has put together. Every dish tasted of fresh ingredients emersed in a good balance of spices and herbs; stimulating the palate in a whole variety of ways but never overdoing it with any one flavour and not just hitting it with chilli. The aubergine dish was the best sample of aubergine that I've ever had and the truffle naan was a unique and welcome addition to the the normal forray of Indian food.For dessert was a 'Chocolate Bounty Bar - Gluten free coconut bounty bar with nougat, apricot and popcorns'. This bounty bar is rich with coconut infused dark chocolate; indulgent and irresistible. The ice cream it came with could have been a little softer but the flavour was good and the apricot sauce and popcorns a nice touch. Finally the meal is topped off with petit fours for each diner which are tiny bites of coffee and cream flavoured layers of sponge.\u00a0Well that was it for the most sublime, well prepared and well served Indian meal that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The\u00a0meaning\u00a0of\u00a0Zaika\u00a0translates to 'sophisticated flavours' - a befitting name for this exquisite restaurant.",

Prior to the appetizers, they brought out papadums with three great sauces: beetroot, tamarind and chili-garlic. We had the zaika salad, the vegetarian trio, the fish trio, the nihari gosht and the laal maas and the dal makhni. Every bite was spectacular. The service was impeccable; they took princely care of us. We were only sorry we couldn't get there more often. Yes, it's more expensive but well worth it.",

    "text": "Top notch food. Elegant dining room. Great atmosphere. But we arrived at 8.25 for our 8.30 table and were asked to wait at the bar because the table wasn't quite ready yet. We waited until 8.50 without a drink, a menu or any update on the state of out table (maybe they were still whittling the legs) until I politely and very English-ly apologised to front of house for the inconvenience but could we 1) get a drink, 2) get a menu and 3) get an update on when our table would be ready.The lady at the front of house hadn't forgotten us which was a shame because if she had I could have understood the radio silence. \"Yes we know you're waiting. A couple of minutes more\" she said. 10 minutes later a waiter came over and asked us whether we would prefer to eat where we were seated. By this time I envisaged us eating our After Eights at After Midnight so we went for it although the table wasn't a dining table at all. Hunger won. Two minutes later the front of house woman came over and told us our table would be ready in two minutes. I guessed that was a different two minutes than the one we had been proffered ten minutes earlier and explained that we had chosen to camp out in the bar area in the hope of eating supper rather than breakfast.No, apparently this was a real two minutes, not a made up one and so we waited and eventually sat at our table at 9.05.I'm not one for moaning or kicking up a fuss and a thing like this isn't usually likely to dampen my enthusiasm for a place if the food is great. We weren't in a rush and it's no punishment whiling away time with the missus in a buzzy dining room with a grand but bustling feel to it like this one.But we waited 40 minutes for a table booked in advance with no communication from the front of house woman whatsoever until I plucked up the courage to ask if we were still in their thoughts. We were only watered (or alcohol-ed as the case was) 25 mins into that wait.The front of house woman's way of dealing with the situation was not to keep us informed and apologise and offer us a drink while we waited, but to become our best friend once we were finally seated at our table. She simpered over three times to ask us how our food was and whether we were having a nice time and to apologise for the wait. I dubbed her Miss Topsy Turvy because she's definitely got her job the wrong way round. If things have gone wrong, just let people know. I'm guessing most people are like us - essentially nice sorts looking forward to a good meal and not bothered about a wait as long as we're informed. Shit happens. Once we're at the table we will happily gorge ourselves on wonderful food until we roll out of there drunk and happy. Job done. But Miss Topsy Turvy spent the whole of our arrival avoiding us in the hope that things would just fix themselves and then became our best mate when we had absolutely no desire for her services any more and just wanted to get on with the happy task of eating, drinking and arguing about brexit. Talking of eating. the lamb chops were simply sumptuously sensational. The three types of scallop were precisely done and deliciously different. Black Dal was tasty (although not quite the unctious joy of the Cinnamon Club's version it has to be said), the lamb biryani was decent (although flavour-wise not a patch on the Dock Kitchen's heavenly effort), The chana dal had great texture and dlavour and the prawns in Fenugreek was divine. I can still taste it now. They should ditch the prawn cracker-esque poppadums and replace with more of the delicious, light crispy-edged naan bread which mopped up every last globule of moisture from plate, serving dish and table. So it is with a heavy heart that an evening I would have given the full five stars to gets a terrible two.Our bar drinks gratis would have solved everything. Or even better, a simple quick heads up. Alas we got neither and Cinnamon Club remains the standard by which I set a posh curry evening. If wrong-way-round-woman takes an HND in front of house management maybe this place could be up there too.",

Trio of Veg (Selection of three veg dishes)There was enough food for all three and the bill came to around \u00a3115.00 which i think is reasonable for the location and quality of the foodI must say i am especially surprised by the unique selection of three chutneys offered, one was a strawberry based one and other some sweet but spicy mix and last was a mango chutney but all seem freshly made and went down a treat. Everyone really enjoyed them.Service was prompt and all food arrived in good time but the restaurant was empty almost but we did arrive at the tail end of the lunch service. Strawberry cooler was refreshing and would highly recommend it. I also like the Vegetarian Trio and Kadai Murgh but all the dishes were great. The menu is not large but great selection of dishes for all including vegetarians and i like that you can select on some dishes if you want them as main size portions or side portions which really helps with cost and waste. Decor and architecture is excellent and inside temperature is perfect, not too hot or cold. Finally we could all hear each other so acoustics were perfect with light background (authentic Indian) music playing. I cannot say however how it fairs when the place is full so looks like i will have to go again and update you all. I highly recommend a visit and although not a fusion place you know what you will get and what you get is a great fresh meal you can fell full at the end of. One more nice touch was the free selection of sweets at the end of the meal, all tasted freshly made.",

We knew it was pricey, but the ambiance seemed nice from the photos online and what the heck, we were on a holiday so a little splurging was fine !!First off: this place is classy !! I haven't seen another Indian restaurant with a better ambianceThe food tasted good, but the quantity was less. But to be fair, we found that food quantity was less pretty much everywhere in London, so that is a norm I guess. the drink options were good too and we(me and my wife and 6 months old) spent a couple of hours there and had a great time and a few conversations to remember ;)Overall, if you are looking to spend quality time in an upscale environment, this is the place.. don't go there if you cant let you pocket strigs lose though.",

The Food is truly excellent, absolutely fresh and served quickly - which brings me to the best part: the Service was amazing, fast, polite and professional. Pricing was adequate I would say adequate, considering the whole experience. I am definitely going there again, next time with more People. ThanksErwin",

    "text": "Had a fantastic lunch at Zaika this past week. Ambiance: The restaurant is beautiful, serene, and spotless.Service: I don't think I've had better service ANYWHERE ELSE. Our main server, who also seemed to be a manager, was so friendly and accommodating. He noticed we didn't eat 1/3 of one of our many dishes and took it off the bill without us even saying a word. Amazing.Food: Top notch.-Vegetarian Trio is delicious. I didn't eat the lentil dumpling because I can't have yogurt but I can say the rest of this appetizer is fantastic.-Seared Scallops are beautiful and delicious.-Zaika Salad didn't below me away - might be the only thing I wouldn't recommend.-Kadai Murgh was devoured by my husband and his picky self never devours anything.-Butter Naan was also devoured by my selfish husband, who didn't leave even a piece for me.-Zaffrani Pulao was delicious. I think I ate almost the entire bowl.Overall this place is fantastic and very reasonably priced considering the quantity and quality of the food. I wouldn't hesitate to return and highly recommend giving Zaika a try.",
