    "text": "Living a 8 minute walk from Wild Food Cafe, I eat there probably once a week. Everything on their menu is yummy - I normally get either the salad special, the raw pizza or the veggie burger with baked sweet potato fries. Their dessert specials are always hard to resist too! They are a great spot, and I am lucky to have them in this area as it makes eating vegan that much easier and more delicious! One thing of note though is that I find the space itself to be rather cramped, especially since it gets very busy during peak times and on the weekends. This, coupled with the slow service, means that I normally just call ahead and take out when I am craving something form Wild Food. However, I know they just remodeled their space, so perhaps this will aid in the facilitation of a more comfortable dining experience.",

The food is very inventive. \u00a0Everything I ate on the special meal platter was novel and intriguing. \u00a0The jamaican platter had 4 servings of different raw and vegetarian creations that were arranged artfully on the plate. \u00a0Visual appeal was definitely a strength.On the flip side, the meal took a very long time to prepare, especially considering everything was pre-made and just needed plating. \u00a0The staff used heart shaped cookie cutters to later different components of the meal in a contained heart on the plate. \u00a0I think it took about 20 minutes to produce 4 plates!Unfortunately, half of the menu was no longer available for dinner - we arrived at 7:30pm or so. \u00a0There was also quite a bit of miscommunication with and by the staff. \u00a0We ordered half orders of the daily special meal, received full orders unknowingly and were billed for the full portion. \u00a0We also had to ask several times for water, the bill, our drinks, etc. \u00a0The servers were, however, very apologetic and ended up charging us for the half portion we intended to order. \u00a0I think they have a few logistical kinks to work out, but there is a lot of potential for a great experience here.",

Not to say that all was flat and not Even making a bit of volume. It look ed like a meal for a 5 years old boy. Taste was great but please why do u hav to take a Piss off people who want to est healthly!!! I d feel imbarrased to serve food in that way! So a big no no for me. There r more plenty of places out there which serve raw food and i can understand it can b expensive but at least keep in mind a more desirable honest portion.",

It was definitely not gazpacho and was sold as containing \"big juicy tomatoes\". \u00a0I mentioned this to the waiter who said the tomatoes have been \"squeezed\".The falafel main dish was falafel without any chickpeas and without the falafel and actually quinoa grain soaked in water on the hardest, toughest, strange, quasi-bread-like-stuff. \u00a0A selection of unidentifiable soft, wet vegetables on top.I've had good macrobiotic fair and good vegetarian but this was ridiculous and the \"ginger beer\" was so slow to be made I'd already finished my main dish. \u00a0Probably good job too as my friend let me taste his - crushed ginger root in cold water which is not ginger beer in anybody's book.To be fair if you're really into raw food you'll probably appreciate this place more than myself.",

If you don't mind some leaflets about yoga and other spiritual stuff lying about, this is a very welcoming dining space. It was very busy but staff were very friendly and helpful. Crunchy kale chips were seasoned with salt and some mixed spice. It was good to see someone doing something positive with kales. We wanted a hummus to complete the starter but they were out. So we ordered butternut squash dip. It was little bit mashy and dry. The main salad consisted of green leaves, avocado, tomato, roasted nuts in mustard dressing. The salad was a true delight. The dressing was a refreshing mix of mustard and slightly fruity sauce. I also ordered a raw cheese cake as dessert. Mind you, my experience up to this point of raw cakes in general had never been overtly positive. The cheese cake was certainly not as good as any baked (or otherwise) cake, but this one was the best raw cake I'd had. It had the texture of mashed tofu and had none of the richness of normal cheese cakes. Chocolate mint cake that my friend ordered was better. It tasted like, well, chocolate and mint. Exactly what it says on the tin. I am still unconvinced about raw cakes in general. With the recent closure of the other vegetarian restaurant at Neil's Yard, Food for Thought, I hope this one will keep going for years to come.",

I had a few issues trying to find something to eat with my onion allergy, but they were accommodating and I was able to have the falafel wrap which was delicious, sweet potato fries which are always a winner, then I topped it off with their delicious chocolate smoothie, and split a chocolate/caramel raw cake and nut free bannoffee cake with my friend, both of which were delicious and very rich!The whole place is very busy, a little scattered and disorganised but there is no question that the food is great. It's not easy to find, given it's in Neal's Yard and then up the stairs but it's well worth it if you can deal with sitting at a table with 6 random strangers! I will certainly be back.",

I definitely suggest trying some of the flavorful raw crackers, which was arguably better than the hummus (which was also delicious). And the cake was rich, creamy, and delectable. I came with an omnivore, who absolutely loved his meal and was pleasantly surprised that raw vegans didn't dine on wilty bland leaves all the time!I also got one of the mushroom teas -- I think it was the energy one.

We went on a stifling hot and muggy day, and there was no AC, so the temperature hung down on us. Upon first choosing to sit by the windows (there is a large area just open to air) we promptly change our minds when I cannot handle the sunlight attacking my face and choose to sit at the bar, while we try to make do with the slug-like progression of the ceiling fan directly above us and the desk fan next to us. The counter-space/bar-space separates us from the \"kitchen,\" so you can see everything happening, as well as all the employees making it happen. Bowls of courgettes, peppers, and lemons litter the space.The walls are hung with trippy, LSD-like paintings, and the chirpy employees are of the dreadlock-wearing, top-knot-tying variety (I spotted a Tree of Gondor tattoo on our server's leg). The menu includes things like 'turkish olives with activated almonds and 'Organic gluten-free un-baked sundried tomatoe & sunflower seed cracker.' We both order a 'vegan cider'--I ask the server what that even means and she tells me that usually the preservatives in regular cider isn't vegan--and he gets the raw chocolate berry cake, and I go for the lemon cheezecake (also raw). The lemon cheesecake was bright and had a strong lemon flavor--you wouldn't be able to tell that all its ingredients were raw--and his cake was dense and moist, but not too sweet at all.I can't speak for the food, but I'm sure it is delicious, the servers were incredibly nice, and if you enjoy the hippie-esque vibes of vegan restaurants, you should definitely add this on the list.",

I think they're going for a social vibe but it just makes it awkward eating whilst sitting squished up next to strangers. The main courses are extortionately priced (but you can get everything takeaway which makes it slightly cheaper, I'll definitely do this next time). My friend had a falafel wrap for \u00a313.50 and she was disappointed with it- small and highly average. I opted to just get a side and a dessert to lower the cost. The sweet potato fries (\u00a34) with delicious, very well cooked with just the right amount of cinnamon. And the raw chocolate and berry cake (\u00a35) is the reason I almost gave this place 5 stars. Seriously the best cake I've had in London. Never tasted anything like it. Absolutely outstanding and the reason that I will return. Multiple times! Also the staff are lovely!",

    "text": "Another vegan restaurant review! This occasion bringing me to the Wild Food Cafe in Neal's Yard.This first-level restaurant is airy and bright despite its very small size. The atmosphere is friendly and the music level is perfect to foster a comfy vibe.It's a pretty communal seating set-up but tables are fully stocked with water, glasses, and napkins (recycled too *eco smiles*).The waiting staff are pleasant and knowledgable though it would have been nice to have a sign to say \"sit where you like\" rather than stand around waiting to be seated.An order of coffee is cheap and you get a small cafeti\u00e8re's worth - which is about three cups - with a choice of milks (coconut is the one you want). The Ayurvedic salad I had was the perfect portion size to get me full but not bloated and the taste was beautifully fresh and interesting. My only gripe with it was that it was a pretty plain salad with all the interesting stuff dumped on top - I wish it had been incorporated better.I also had the raw vegan tart which tasted fresh, lemony, and generally very tasty but for the slightly grainy texture.I was happy to learn that everything on the menu is vegan (barring an item with halloumi) so you don't have to play find-the-things-I-came-here-for.Another minor thing is that some of the stock is stored under the benches (it really is that small); it disrupted the meal a bit to have someone pulling a jar of pickles out of my seat. Having said that it was great to have a full view of the kitchen and to see how cleanly and well organised the ingredients were stored.Overall I was very happy with the taste and attention to detail. A few rough edges did make an impression - but not enough to warrant dropping a star. I will definitely be back :)",

Lest you think I am exaggerating, during my last visit, I spent exactly 1 hr 5 minutes at the venue; 55 min ordering and waiting and 10 minutes eating.Again, the food was great and I keep coming back but by 30 minutes in, I am usually in a strange opposite zen state where I am unable to make conversation with my companions and only able to size up the other diners; who came after I was seated, who can I destroy to obtain my entree first, how are some people just eating thier meals and ignoring the torture being doled out to the rest of us, WHAT IS LIFE? And then the food finally comes and it's so pleasing and delicious and my anxiety disappears and I am so happy to be here and so glad that I waited and the murderous impatience of fellow diners still waiting to be served seems so unjustified now. I will probably be back. Wahhh.",

It was good, but the sandwich part was hard to eat (it was open faced). The grain bread was good as well. My friend had the (raw vegan) pizza, topped with lots of vegetables, and it looked pretty good. The servings are quite small, so it's not a great value for your money. However, the huge windows and plentiful natural light made it a great dining experience.",

Their locally sourced ciders and smoothie was to die for. The sweets looked amazing and the salads and pizza as well. Everything is refined sugar free, dairy free, and animal free. I could see myself coming here quite frequently if I lived on the right side of the Atlantic Ocean. Great concept, wish there were more places with this large of a vegan menu back home. Their special board is great too, try it out!!",

Probably half the customers are regulars and this results in lots of hugging and for non-regulars to wait a relatively long time.My dish was decent except for the hair in my mushroom burger. What was more alarming was that I couldn't figure out whose hair was in my burger since the kitchen is open and no one cooking had that color hair.....still it has decent food and a wonderful atmosphere. Will come back and try again! Hopefully no hair this time.",

I have recently turned to a plant-based diet and the only reason I was looking forward to come here was that I wouldn't have to hunt for something I could eat--the whole menu would be suited to someone like me. But then again, with everything on the menu being plant-based and cooked below 42\u00b0F, I failed to see how my palate would be happy after the meal.I was so wrong. And I am happy for that. I dragged an omnivore friend along with me and both of us enjoyed our meals. I had the cult sandwich with kale chips and it was divine. The cashew nut aioli it came with was the bomb. And I could've happily gorged on those kale chips till I was ready to burst. My friend had the pizza which was amazing too. Now it wasn't your usual pizza and the base was made of an almond and butternut squash. And it was smeared with some amazing marinara. Overall, very satisfying--even for the omnivore. We had the smoothies--white zen & forgotten ecstasy--too and they were delicious. But the star of the show had to be the wild banoffee pie. I can't even begin to tell you how good it was. Don't go plant based, don't eat all the other stuff on the menu, but do come here for that banoffee pie. You will not be disappointed.I could eat here practically everyday!",

    "text": "If you love raw vegan cuisine I'd definitely recommend a visit to this popular little caf\u00e9 nestled in the heart of Covent Garden. Small menu, but I like that, everything has to be fresh and it was. The raw crackers and hummus was delicious. I was sitting within easy reach/sight of the waitresses and this may have contributed to the good service I received (other reviews seem to pinpoint service as an issue). The doorway was completely manic as there isn't a place to wait inside meaning people were queuing on the narrow stairs and blocking the doorway. The toilets weren't great either. It may be possible that it has outgrown this location and would benefit from a move to a larger site.",

    "text": "Review from Beca & Yana at SeekNPlay.coWild Food Cafe is located in the peaceful, healthy haven that is Neal's Yard, one of Covent Gardens secret gems, home to Neal's Yard Remedies and other small businesses. Many people are unaware that this place exists unless stumbling across it when walking around the little streets in Seven Dials. Stepping in to the yard feels like and instant escape from London's crazy hustle and bustle, a place where you can clear your mind and forget you are standing in a city of 8.7 million people.The Wild Food Cafe is here to promote aliveness and embody a world in which plant-passionate, nutrient-packed food that is prepared and served with love is not only possible, \u00a0it is necessary! We arrived at a perfect time of 5.30 pm, being able to walk straight through the big blue door, up the stairs and seated comfortably at one of their communal tables without having to queue. Which I've heard is rare.Although a fairly small venue, there was a great atmosphere of lively chatter and enjoyment of the food. The staff had a major role in this, with their positive attitudes and willingness to answer questions about the menu.After skimming over the mouth-watering menu several times, we finally ordered. It didn't take long for our drinks to come out.I went for the Forgotten Ecstasy: Summer Edition (\u00a37) Acai berries, blueberries, lavender with raw cacao powder, cacoa butter, fresh coconut milk, dates, he-shou-wou extract, maca, algarroba, coconut cream and maple syrup. Wow what a concoction hey... many of these ingredients I have never heard of before, cue the research. Forgotten Ecstasy was rich and filling but in a good way, the strong chocolate taste with a subtle hint of berries and lavender is a winner from me and something I will get again on my next visit.Danielle went for the Make Your Own juice (\u00a36) Apple, Pear and Cucumber fresh and simple tasting but apparently delicious.The gorgeous Danielle devoured the Indian Split Pea Soup & Superseed Bread (\u00a37), the flavour of the day, this is suggested as a starter but is more than enough to have as a main. After much begging Dani allowed me to have a taste, not a major soup fan, this was perfection and wouldn't ordering this on my next visit. So pleased I went for the #TGBOAT , the price not so much at a whopping \u00a316.70. I added the Cashew Aioli for an extra \u00a32, not worth it, but I will let it slide. The meal was just what I needed. The root vegetable jerk burger , and lots of other ingredients, was an explosion of flavoursome ingredients and far better than any meaty burger I have ever had... big statement but it's true. Normally I am one to eat everything off a menu, after my drink and main I had to admit defeat as I could not fit in another crumb. It is safe to say that you won't leave the table feeling hungry! The food and overall experience was hands down spot on. The only thing that would stop me visiting weekly would be the price tag, but it is understandable considering how they source the natural produce and keep to the promise of everything being completely fresh.Joel and Aiste, the owners, have certainly poured their heart and soul into making the Wild Food Cafe such a success. Their love to encourage healthy eating and passion of promoting the endless possibilities of creating so many wonderful plant based dishes.All I can say is visit the Wild Food Cafe and see what you think.It has not only opened my eyes to trying out different produce but it has also inspired me to look at more vegetarian recipes. I am already planning my next trip and this time I will make room for pudding...the Raw Chocolate Tart is calling my name !Thanks for reading.",

    "text": "To summarize: the service was pretty flaky and sporadic, but the food was to die for.I had a pretty awful time finding this place because it is on a tiny side street called Neal's Yard....and I smartly kept wandering around Neal's St. So just be aware of that possible mistake.We went up and sat down on the communal tables (only communal tables or bar seating) and could not for the life of us get ourselves to be noticed. It is a pretty small restaurant and the waiter gave a menu to the group that sat next to us, but would not come to greet us or give us a menu. I tried to make eye contact with him but every time we would engage he would look away. Finally a waitress at the bar realized we had not been helped yet and gave us a menu. This is basically how the service continued to work, the wait staff is not assigned particular jobs, they are just supposed to walk around and take care of whatever needs to be done and I felt that this method left room for many gaps in their service. I ordered the pizza and my mom got the soup of the day.Once we got the food we were hooked! The food is quite expensive but the freshness, flavors, and combination of ingredients made it all worth it! We were oohing and aahing at every bite!Then the pains with the wait staff kicked in again. I had noticed a specials dessert menu on the far wall, but it annoyingly had the items written in alternating dark purple and blue chalk. The dark purple was completely impossible to read against the black chalkboard so I went to ask for a dessert menu. The waitress completely dismissed me and pointed to the board and said that that was their menu and walked away. Wrong. That was just the specials dessert menu and I could not even read it! We then asked another waitress and she kindly brought us the menu. The two desserts I wanted were out of stock so we just got the chocolate cake which was decent. An overall disappointing experience in terms of service, but the main dishes were so delicious.",

Wild food cafe is a place where you would want to go to relax unwind and honor the food you are eating. All of their food is organic and wild crafted. I was in a 5 star restaurant but for half the price. They are very creative with their dishes and it's also affordable. I ordered: from favorite to least fav.1. Grilled butternut squash bruschetta- If you are crazy about butternut squash you have to get this. 2. Apricot spiced hummus - hummus done the right way, very tasty 3. Ayurvedic super salad - \u00a0So many flavors in one dish and extremely healthy 4. Chickpea tofu salad - Not a fan of tofu, but I could eat this againDessert 1. Wild banoffee pie - melts in your mouth and is so light and delicate, kind of like a toffee creamy flavor.Please see Instagram: @brandyespi for more food reviews all around the world.",

I wound up sitting at the bar and had to call for people when I wanted to order and to pay. They didn't seem to acknowledge me much. It was a bit frustrating. The Venus Bowl also wasn't that great. It felt a bit dry and definitely not worth 15 pounds for one dish.I wouldn't recommend this place as a must-go for friends visiting London. The area it's in is nice to walk around though.",

Went at 1-2pm on a Saturday and it was extremely busy, and I had to wait 20 minutes to get a seat. I enjoy vegan food but the main entree that I got, the ramen noodles, were a little bit too healthy for me, and I didn't really feel too full after. I purchased a raw chocolate tart which I enjoyed tremendously, it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall, the restaurant was pretty expensive and I probably wouldn't come back because of the prices.",

    "text": "I googled \"raw vegan London\" and Wild Food Cafe was one of the top results. I happened to be somewhat nearby, so I decided to walk over. Neal's Yard, where Wild Food Cafe is located, must have been a real treat a few years back; it's its own cute little courtyard-like area surrounded by shops and greenery. The buildings all look fun and are brightly colored, and the area itself is pretty -- you can see it if you're seated at one of the windows in the cafe, as it's located just about the Neal's Yard Remedies Shop. Now, though. the area is crazy busy and touristy. I imagine that's one of the reasons Wild Food was so packed when I went on a Saturday afternoon at 4 pm. The other is that the food is delicious. To be fair, I only ordered a slice of banoffee pie, but as I was seated at the bar I saw so many other dishes being prepared and they all at least looked amazing. The lady who prepared my pie (who was super nice, btw) took so much care when assembling it. It was art, there's no other way to put it. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the prices are a little steep (steeper if you're from somewhere like the US where the $ to \u00a3 conversion rate hurts a little. I did keep in mind that I was in central London in a touristy area, though, and at least I can say what I ordered was both beautiful and delicious! One slight hiccup in my experience: I stood next to the \"please wait to be seated\" sigh at the entrance, and one of the waitresses looked at me a few times without seating or acknowledging me. Then, she tried to seat me at a table with three other people when there were a few seats at the bar available. Glad the food was good because that quickly fell to the back of my mind! Oh and FYI: My pie came to just about \u00a38 (with an \"optional\" tip added automatically).",

    "text": "This is a pretty popular place and it's all vegan - from burgers, sandwiches, crackers, salads, and desserts, there are a lot of choices to be had. Certainly a good option for the vegetarians/vegans out there. I like healthy food and crave a good salad, but felt like this place fell short for me compared to the price/quality/taste of salads elsewhere. This place is located up the stairs in Neal's Yard, next to Home Slice. Go up the stairs and you'll see a very colorful, small room. This is not the place to come with a large group - I'd say a party size of 4 is the maximum, but I'd recommend just coming solo or with one other person as there's not much room and there are mostly long communal tables.I got the Japanese kale salad. I normally really love kale salads, but this was a little too healthy-tasting for me, and I like salads and healthy things. I think it also had some butternut squash, mushrooms, pumpkin seeds, almonds, beets, and maybe eggplant. Proportionally, it was a little too much kale to the other ingredients and didn't feel that balanced. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a salad I'd be craving again. It was also a bit expensive, I paid around \u00a310.50 for the takeaway salad here, if I had eaten here, it was somewhere around \u00a312-13, which is not cheap for a salad. I have to be honest, a salad at Pret-a-Manger for 1/2 the price would have probably been just as satisfying.I'd be willing to give this place another shot - maybe my salad was just off that day, but it is pricier than most other salad places in the area. If you're looking for vegan food, this is probably a decent bet, but if you're looking for just something healthy, there are a lot of other options nearby.",

My cousin was getting a smoothie, and I didn't want to be jealous so decided to get one too. I chose the Alp-accino because the waiter told me it was voted the best drink in London, so I had to try it. The Alp-accino is a coffee smoothie, with interesting sounding ingredients such as moss and medicinal mushrooms (what even is that?) so I was a bit apprehensive at first to order it. We stood at the bar and watched as our drinks were made. Each smoothie has tons of different components, and the guy making them made them all look beautiful, with different toppings and whipped (coconut) cream. Mine ended up being delicious. I was so impressed that such a \"healthy\" smoothie didn't taste that healthy, it was more like a coffee & chocolate milkshake. Also coconut whipped cream is incredibly delicious...even better than normal whipped cream. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in London, but if I lived there I don't think it would be a go-to place because it is really expensive (7 pounds for a smoothie...). However, everything on the menu is plant-based, so this is a great spot to go with vegan or veggie friends.",

    "text": "The Wild Food Cafe is an eclectic little restaurant on the second floor of a building in the Covent Garden district. It has an open kitchen layout and bench seating so do not expect a private dining experience as you will be shoulder to shoulder with your fellow diners. The atmosphere is typical of a vegan restaurant with inspirational messages about sustainability and hippy murals on the walls. The food unfortunately ruins any chance of a good review due to the incredible blandness. I ordered the burger with a side of kale chips. Each of the dishes were very tasteless and the burger was very dry even with the sauce that was on it. The strange bun is a dry disk of pressed grains which is quite tough and heavily detracts from the tastes of the interior of the burger. It also is brittle and falls apart making it required to use a knife and fork. The kale chips are also equally dull, which is sad because a little cayenne, rosemary, or cumin would definitely vastly improve the flavor of that side dish. Kale does not need to be like cardboard. I wanted so much to like this place, but the only redeeming factor is the decently priced wine. I will try back in a few months to see if they have improved.",

My husband and I who have been vegans since 1991 and 1990 respectively, went to this totally vegan and organic restaurant the other day and plan on returning again and again. The food is amazing and the staff are wonderful. Harry was warm and welcoming, charming and knowledgeable. I love desserts and so began with them. The raw cheesecake was not only aesthetically pleasing, but may well have been the best I have ever tasted. The banana bread, which I began the meal with as well was delicious and also presented in such a beautiful manner. Next, I had the sushi and sweet potato fries. This is definitely the place to visit if you are vegan and even if you are not, do try it. You will not regret it. We went a second time and it was just as wonderful as the first. My spouse had the raw courgette pasta and he loved it. I had desserts to begin, the raw cheesecake and the lemon verbena tart and sushi. Delicious! Even more delightful than the food was the wonderful person who served us, Reda. She was so warm and loving, exactly the kind of person you hope to meet in this life and she helps make this an absolute all time favorite in our traveling life.This restaurant knows that the people who work there make the food even better tasting than it already is, for they are amazing people serving amazing food.",
