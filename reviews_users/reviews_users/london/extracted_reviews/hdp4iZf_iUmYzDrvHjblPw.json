This place isn't anywhere near that level of food...BUT... It's still good!! We went for the crispy duck, some dim sum and a spicy noodles. The dim sum was ok (better than most places but not the best) the noodles were good although spicyer that expected, which was good for me as I like them like that. The duck was really good!!! We went for the half and it was easily enough for 4. We didn't have any issue with the food or the service bit quite a few people round us were grumbling about the seating and food. The price is mid level, not cheap but good for a treat.The bar/restaurant is very cool looking although I don't think it works as a pub... It's a restaurant, a nice restaurant. The beer menu is extensive but mostly bottles, very few on tap (that were on the menu)One down fall is the seating is a little on top of each other, a fact that was obviously getting th complaints. I reckon a few more weeks and this place will have it all worked out and it will be a top place for a night out.",

    "text": "It was a day of relatively disappointing expensive food. London can be so hit and miss sometimes. Having used to live in the neighborhood, I've been wanting to try the Duck and Rice ever since it was supposed to open in 2014. It finally did in 2015 and it truly became for the East Asian foodie community in London, one of the most anticipated restaurant openings. I've tried on numerous occasions, as I would never sit down at the bar, to book a table and have dinner here, but 1. the prices scared me away, and 2. it was impossible to get a table. I've walked in here probably as many times as I've called and without success either. So, of course,, I pick the last Saturday to walk in with friends and we do get seated, only because someone else didn't show. Anyway, as luck would have it, I should have probably listened to the unluckiness from before and stopped trying to come here. The food is definitely decent, and flavorful, but good lord is it salty. We had the salt and pepper squid, the kai lan seasonal veggies, the malaysian duck curry, the ribs and the black pepper glass noodles. Everything but the duck curry was overly seasoned and doused in garlic - I wondered if there was a whole bunch that they needed to use and just made things extra garlicky. Anyway, what you're really paying for is the renovation of this once a watering hole for the locals of Soho - much to my utmost annoyance. The atmosphere fits one of my core values - i.e. it's young and it's introducing Chinese food to British yuppies (albeit in a laid back, rather contrived pub/club vibe, reeking of TOWIEsque lads and lasses). It also completely violates another of my core values that food should come first and the environment compliment rather than cover for the lack of good cooking. Service is good, however, and redeems this place from a bottom of the heap finish. However, for \u00a330 a head, I'd rather have stuffed myself silly at equally qualified, probably even finer cuisine at Royal China or Phoenix Palace.",

It started with a great seat overlooking Berwick, followed by Jacques who was the best waiter we encountered in London and then with his assistance we sampled a great portion of the menu including sesame prawn toast, pork bun, Szechuan chicken dumplings, signature duck, egg fried rice and #23. We concluded with chocolate pudding with lemon creme anglaise. When we return to London we will be back",

Food:- hot and sour soup: smelled like sewage, and fertilizer. My girlfriend said the soup reminded her of her unwashed dogs. - duck salad: was good but not as great as in Hakkasan- sweet and sour pork: very good!!- wasabi prawns: they were fried and tasted fine. The best wasabi prawns in London are however at Kai Mayfair. - prawns and vermicelli noodles with cucumber: tasted extremely fishy. They tasted like when you walk into a fish market. And they were made with dried shrimp. I didn't like them. Altogether positive because we received 50% off the bill (which is valid for new guests for another 2 days according to the restaurant). We paid \u00a340, for which the value was good! However if I would've paid \u00a380 (without drinks) I would have not come back.",

    "text": "Throughout our time in London we never had concrete plans of where we wanted to eat so we picked restaurants that looked good walking around. From the outside, Duck and Rice looked like a very hip restaurant with the open windows on the second floor. It was packed! Knowing how busy it was, we still gave it a shot and asked if they had a table for two. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long and were seated within five minutes.The decor was cool, although they crammed a lot of tables on both floors. We had a table on the second floor that was very difficult to get in and out of. Our waiter was nice, but with a heavy non-British accent he was often hard to understand.We started off with two beers and ordered the crispy duck fried rice and lemon chicken. What I thought was odd was that the lemon chicken didn't come with rice or noodles on the side, you had to pay extra for it. Duck fried rice was good, but really lacking on both the flavor and amount of crispy duck. Lemon chicken had great flavor especially in conjunction with the rice we ordered (egg fried rice).Based on reviews, a lot of people are saying it's fairly expensive, but I'm used to paying a premium for a meal at home so I can't necessarily agree. Although, I don't think the flavor of the food necessarily warrants a second trip if I'm back in London.",

    "text": "Tried (in vain) to get into Hoppers. In the process of being disappointed by their hostess who told everyone outside that no more table requests were being taken for that entire evening at 5:00(!), struck up a conversation with a lovely Brit who was in the same fix -- he recommended we try The Duck and Rice, though he said he thought it might be equally hard to get into. As dinner time approached we found our way to Berwick Street and amazingly grabbed their last table for two! What a great place -- noisy, crazy, fun street level with bar and somewhat quieter but still super bouncy second level up the winding staircase. )Side note: they might have the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat on in a restaurant.) \u00a0Tucked into a G & T with a licorice stick and munched on edamame - perfect with flakes of salt. The husband and I started with Sesame Prawn Toast and Jasmine Tea Smoked Rib Bao Buns. Holy smokes they were good -- I could probably live on the Bao Buns for several months and not miss a single other item of food! Main dishes were French Bean Stir Fry and Singapore Fried Noodles -- equally delicious and just enough of an after burn to make us happy - Yay! The service was fantastic -- friendly and helpful and the energy of the place made the whole evening memorable. Thank God we met that lovely man outside of Hoppers!",

This place has a brilliant drink selection-I had a few different beers and then some Gin and Tonics...all really good!The main attraction was the food, I think London struggles with affordable, nice Chinese food, so was over the moon when I found here.We tried quite a bit, with my favourites starting to pile up. some highlights included--Salt and Pepper squid-fresh, tasty and not grease in sight-Duck Rolls-loved these-really tasty and fresh-The BBQ ribs-again really tasty, lots of meat and good flavours-The duck-a must for any Chinese for me, and these guys got it spot on!So the reasons we are a star short-the waiter forgot we ordered shredded beef (one of my favourites), and when we reminded him, we were told the kitchen was shut so we couldn't have it. Not something I expect to hear in a restaurant really...just still the pan on and cook some up. We were a big table spending a lot of money so the response was surprising. Top 3 tips for this place-1.Book, it can get busy, especially if you are a big group. They don't have many larger tables. 2.Share-loads of great things are on the menu so don't all order the same, mix it up and taste everything3.The drinks are great, so try a few and give yourself time to chill in the pub down the stairs to carry on the afternoon/evening",

    "text": "Duck and Rice has been one of the most hotly anticipated restaurant openings for this year, coming from London restaurateur Alan Yau, the owner of Yauatcha, Hakkasan and Wagamama. The idea is a Chinese themed gastropub in prime Soho real estate, right around the corner from Yauatcha. I thought it would be incredibly difficult to get a table, so when I emailed the reservations line a week ago, the request was more along the lines of \"when is your next available table?\" rather than \"can I get a table next week?\" But to my surprise, I was able to get a table on opening day, April 13, at my requested time of 7 PM without a problem.The entrance is dominated by a large copper beer tank, and behind it are tables that are arranged in a high table quasi-bar setting, and I think you can just walk in there. I was confused because there was no around to check my reservation, so I wandered upstairs, which was a more obviously restaurant setting. The first day was not super crowded, as I could see the odd empty table here and there, but also not very chaotic, which I guess is the benefit of having a few weeks of soft openings already.The menu is large and very overwhelming, with one side dedicated to food and the other, entirely to drinks. However, the menu items have no descriptions, and even with the experience of having eaten a lot of Chinese food over the years, I found myself asking the waiter a lot of questions because I didn't recognise so many of the names. In the end, we ordered two dim sum dishes - a venison puff and duck spring rolls, Singapore fried noodles, Jasmined smoked pork rib, crispy shredded beef, and some steamed rice. The waiter recommended one more dish, but that was already more than enough food. I had really wanted to order some seasonal vegetables, but at around \u00a310 for nothing more interesting than bok choy, it seemed like a total rip off.The first 3 plates were our dim sum dishes and the Singapore fried noodles. I loved both the venison puff and the spring rolls - you get 3 of the former and 2 of the latter, but the spring rolls are huge and cut in half, and are served with a lovely hoisin sauce. They are also very generously stuffed with duck meat, so you can't go wrong here. The Singapore noodles were the size of a main, and the main reason that we thought that we had gotten too much food. They were very heavily spiced and extremely flavorful... but definitely was enough to comfortably share between 4-5 people.Next we had the Jasmine smoked pork rib and the crispy shredded beef. When we ordered, I had asked a lot about the crispy shredded beef, as I had never heard of anything like it before, and our Spanish waiter sounded like he didn't know much more, except that it was a highly recommended dish. It was very disappointing. In theory, they shred some beef and deep fry it, but in the end it came out like crunchy pork rind or something, served with enormous Sichuan peppers and rather unmemorable in terms of taste. The Jasmine smoked pork rib was the exact opposite, with a rack of about 7 ribs and an intensely strong smoky flavour, and very unique.Throughout the whole meal, I had the Czech pilsner and my friend had a Chinese beer and then a Japanese beer, both of which were wheat beers that tasted like Hoegaarden. The one thing I will say is that the foreign bottled beers do not come cheap - they are upwards of \u00a37. The ones on tap are all European, with the likes of London Pride, a Scottish pilsner, and even a cider. When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had gotten all the food at 50% off, which had not been advertised. It is unclear if they are still doing their soft opening... I asked the waiter and he said that he thought it would go on until Thursday, but it was happening at the manager's discretion. If I had known, I would have definitely gone for the roast duck or the whole lobster! (they were like \u00a340ish)Overall, this restaurant is certainly not cheap at normal prices, but then again it is Soho. It kind of reminds me of Hutong in the Shard, obviously with the focus on the roast duck and fairly similar prices. I don't get a strong impression that they are like a pub, large copper beer tank aside. I might pop in here for a beer, more because they stock some unique ones like the Chinese and Japanese ones my friend had, rather than for the vibe. The dishes are something in between tapas size and main plates, though personally I feel like they should focus on making them more like tapas. I'm glad I got the opportunity to check it out, but I wouldn't be in a rush to return again.",

    "text": "Meh! Went to the bar downstairs at the Duck and Rice but wasn't really feeling it . Vicky L suggested it's because I am freaked out by the fact it's no longer the Endurance pub - the old boozer that existed on this site before Alan Yau restaurateur funked it up with snazzy windows and fittings. \u00a0But I suspect it was just because it's not that special.Perhaps my meh ness could be down to pre Christmas fatigue. It was pretty busy, people were unfriendly here (not the staff, just the people) and we moved spots SIX times in the night before we found a place where three of us could drink happily.The menu was a bit of a mash up. Beer cocktails rule the drinks list - perhaps a nod to its public house former life. Some beers cost \u00a38. What kind of weird parallel universe has Alan Yau created where beer costs as much as cocktail?You can get 'pub food' too. Not cheap but decent value to share, and great that it's gastro-Chinese. However the staff weren't able to adequately explain what is in their food - which in my book reaches new levels of Meh-ness. \u00a0Although my friends explicitly asked them, they weren't told that shellfish was in the spring rolls. And we were wrongly delivered the salt and pepper squid instead of the chicken. Therefore I ended up accidentally eating two things I shouldn't be eating. Double meh. My pals were happy at least though as they got the squid for free on top of our chicken.Also the music is loud, but allegedly you can control the playlist and queue up a song if you log into their wifi on and go to their website. We were there for an age and we never heard the gorgeous C-Pop song we lovingly picked. It's all lies I tells ya.Oh and one last meh, the downstairs where the toilets were smelt so bad and unpleasant.. But they do redeem themselves with the loos \u00a0because they actually had Thomas Crapper cisterns. However it seriously can't be good, when the bogs are the best thing about the Duck and Rice. \u00a0So Generally meh - but this is a review just for the downstairs bar. Perhaps I will give it another chance when it's less busy after Christmas, and i expect the restaurant upstairs will be different altogether.",

I was wrong about all things but one - the food is a tad on the pricey side but it is very delicious. We got wasabi prawns, the crispy aromatic duck and siu mai. The siu mai I was most impressed with - bursting with meaty flavor it could comfortably go head to head in a competition with any HK treat. The duck made me think of a different version of Peking duck - same fixings different kind of duck. Wasabi prawn is tender and had great sauce and almonds. Also worth a special mention is the beer negroni and the wide selection of draft beer. Cool vibe, great service - if I can find a more affordable less trendy version of this place I think I would have found a personal nirvana in the city. In the meantime Duck and Rice is a solid option when I get my Asian food cravings",

    "text": "It was the kind of mid-day that felt like the world was running at low-volume. The sun had risen at 6am and heated the asphalt to a hazy warmth. Lazy tourists, having reached where they had wanted to come, now milled about the streets without a strong sense of where to go next.I quietly slipped into duck and rice where a muted TV played the world-cup in the background. Portugal v. Morocco. The ball was in Portugal's possession, dribbled and passed downfield.What should we get, I pondered? There was a Chinese person from China. Two from Canada. Another, myself, from the USA. All having coalesced in London, we now found ourselves in this Chinese restaurant, which on the outsides were decorated in a mainly western fashion: red-bricks and tin-barrels. Gin instead of Baijiu was on the alcohol menu.On screen, a Moroccan defender challenged the attack. The Portuguese player expertly evaded the slide.Do we want Dim Sum? Cantonese Duck? Crispy Aromatic Duck? Some committed to foods and then pulled out, others had come before and knew what they already wanted: jasmine ribs, duck fried rice.Now downfield, a shot was deflected by Morocco's goalkeeper, the ball flew back for a corner kick.I wondered briefly what kind of food I really wanted - the choice becoming as much a question of my identity as one of the thousands of lunches I've had before. I mean this was a Chinese establishment, right? So maybe I should go with that? But how Chinese could it be given that it was in the heart of London? I bet it could only survive in its location, outside of Chinatown, because of its decor - making white diners feel safe and comfortable in familiar territory. The ribs, I heard, were meant to taste like a Texas BBQ with a dash of jasmine flavor. Which of those were meant to taste like home for me, I wasn't sure.The anticipation built up in the soccer stadium. Players organized themselves in optimal setting to go towards the goal.After careful deliberation, I ventured into a dish that I had never heard of before: the \"sha-cha glass noodle claypot\" with my comfort zone of egg fried rice on the side. One to keep me grounded with a common narrative thread to the past, the other gave me the possibility to grow into something new.The corner kick flew. Ronaldo appeared. The ball hurtling deep into the net. Portugal went wild. And for a brief moment, the energy of the crowd's cheer passed out of the TV and into my body. And as fast as it came, faded back into the still-muted screen that cast the same scene to millions of people around the world.",

I mean the name, we finally made it in the 2nd try since it was so busy n overhyped as it turnt outpoints:(1) Service lacked @ 1st b/c they don't even know who was supposed 2 serve us(2) Tank Old Fashioned was ok for 11 British Pounds hell 2 the N O!(3) Fried chicken wings, green peppercorn - actually their best but not by much(4) Five spice fried chicken - should have named it I copy American KFC Popcorn Chicken for copyright infringement(5) Crispy aromatic duck - n this is supposed 2 b 1 of their signature dishes.. I don't think so.. go 2 Chinatown's Hung's way better n cheaper.. duck dry, hoisin sauce was ok(6) Pork & prawn shumai - bland n boring2 stars; I've experienced much better.. believe me, u won't miss a thing",

The crispy duck with pancakes and plum sauce is a must have. The salt and pepper aubergine, currently a special, should be a mainstay. The Baos are also very good. Desert selection is limited but you probably won't have that much space left; the sticky toffee seems boxed but is still tasty.Bar-wise, good selection of tap beer. Interesting beer-based cocktails if you are curious. The gin cocktails are underwhelming. The \u00a0decor elegantly walks \u00a0the fine line between trendy and pretentious. \u00a0Service is very good.",

The dumplings were ok, could have been a bit more flavoursome (but I'm not a dumpling expert). The quarter crispy duck was delicious, served with pancakes. The No. 23 was quite normal, noodles with chicken; nothing too special. Overall the food was decent.Price: The price was very reasonable given the amount of food there was on the table!",

We ordered several dishes - the Szechuan dumplings, edamame, chicken wings, Singapore fried noodles, green beans with minced pork, and the signature dish of duck and rice - and everything was amazing.The wings in particular stood out for us because they were super crispy and easy to eat. Basically, it was all the 'wing' portion (no 'drumstick'-looking bits) that were split in half so each piece only had one bone inside, which meant you could bite all of the meat off in one go; did that make any sense? The dipping sauce was just fish sauce with chilies and our server recommended we squeeze in the lime. It was phenomenal.The duck was super tender so they definitely know what they're doing and are allowed to have the name that they do.The noodles were just slightly spicy (we were hoping for more of a kick) but executed really well.There were only two of us dining so in the end, we had quite a few leftovers to take home and \u00a0our waiter kindly wrapped everything up for us neatly.It is rather pricey, but I think it's nice for a special occasion. Our special occasion was that we were on holiday in London, so there you go.",
