(It's not).The trouble is, I have to go there pretty regularly, for band rehearsals. This time around, I thought I'd numb the pain a bit with a decent breakfast. We had an early morning rehearsal booked in so I thought I'd yelp somewhere for breakfast. Jack's came up, so off I went.Jack's has a solid menu of half Brit, half-Yank fare. I had the Benedict (as part of my ongoing Eggs Benedict in London mission) and it was absolutely fine for the money. The hollandaise was great and the eggs perfectly runny. The filter coffee wasn't bad either.So my advice is, if you find yourself in the cultural desert of Clapham Junction, you could do loads worse than popping into Jack's for some comfort food.",

I have a very small stomach but I managed to eat all my breakfast, was so nice! It is a popular place but the staff are very efficient and hard working so you never have to wait long. They are also very efficient withtheir space so also the cafe is relatively small you can still find a table for you and your friends.

I love that it always comes with hash browns: it has been a permanent struggle to get a side of hash browns with breakfast in London (without it costing an additional \u00a33 etc), so this really was a revelation to me. Big breakfast is pretty special all things considered.Scanning the room we saw future inspiration: large yummy looking salads on display.Soda could have come with ice on a hot day. Just sayin'.",

It is faithful to the American diner breakfast experience not only in terms of the breakfast dishes on offer - corned beef hash, eggs benedict (with variations), french toast, pancakes, bottomless coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice (it always stuns me that we British tolerate the awful ersatz alternative) - but also insofar as it is very reasonably priced (all dishes less than \u00a37 I think) and doesn't take pains to dress itself up self-consciously as an authentic American diner (so no misplaced candy stripes or polished Arizona licence plates). I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs, which was wonderful and I actually liked the unusual addtion of a little carrott. My companion had a full breakfast with french toast, which he heartily enjoyed. The placed was packed on a Saturday morning but we still got a table and the service was, though a little muddled, was never less than friendly and enthusiastic. I haven't been yet for lunch, but the salad menu did appeal.In short, it's everything i've been waiting for - a cheap, cheerful American diner a stone's throw from where I live and that is a genuine restaurant rather than a marketing ploy.",

Brusque servers, quick-service food, clanking cutlery, elbowing your neighbours, unlimited filter coffee, pay at the till, cheap prices - diner.The food runs the gamut in terms of country of origin. Something to note: American pancakes are on offer, although they're a little less fluffy and a bit more dense than you might expect. Also, order them with some butter on the side, because they won't come with it.Overall, the place has a good buzz about it.

A fiver gets you a basic English \u00a0breakfast, which is filling and tasty, though nothing I couldn't have gotten at a caf down the road for the same price. My dad enjoyed his corned beef hash and my mom really enjoyed her omelette. This place seems really famous for its pancakes though unfortunately we didn't try them. The service, though quick, is a bit annoying as you do have to call someone over for refills. Definitely a good place to go if you're already in the area, but if you're not then just go to your own local favourite, it'll be just as good.",

The breakfast is gross value for money and isn't dripping in grease. Nothing is over cooked or feels as though it has been sat around. Honestly have no bad words to say about the food. The owner is so jolly and always has a huge smile. I go there pretty much every weekend.Ps the brownies are amazing :)",

    "text": "You just can't beat this place - it's an absolute 5 star winner for me!! I've been here more than a few times and pretty much everything about the place keeps me coming back. Plonked right by Clapham Junction station, Jack's at the Junction is a great stop -off on your way to and from a train. Honestly, it's a great stop-off whenever, but I've mended a fair few hangovers en route to a long train journey in here.The food...oh the food! The first thing to say is that you should go in here with an appetite. If you're just after a piece of toast or a little bowl of muesli, go somewhere else. It would be almost disrespectful to come in here without a rumbling stomach...There's every kind of breakfast imaginable in here - pancakes, full cooked, eggs coked in every possible way! It's basically a breakfast-lover's heaven. I have sampled many thing in here but the Double - a simple, but massive cooked breakfast - is one of my favourites. There's so much space to go wrong with a full-cooked breakfast; too many aspects to get right and too many opportunities to stumble and fall. Jack's does not stumble and fall... Every part of the Double is as tasty as the next - all packed with flavour and cooked to perfection. To top it off, there's unlimited coffee (which is great because it makes you feel like you're in NYC) and I got a juice as part of my breakfast, which was lovely!The pancakes, too, are big fluffy piles of delight. I've witnessed the eggs florentine sampled as well and, though eggs are not my breakfast of choice, I am told these were spot on too. The atmosphere is great in here - it's always packed and sometimes you end up squeezed onto a table with other people. This maybe isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I love it. The staff are friendly and surprisingly un-manic considering the vibe.All in all, Jack at the Junction is a must-visit if you're anywhere nearby! Don't miss it or you'll be missing out.",

I got the Yankee, which was two pancakes, 2 bacon, and eggs. It also came with OJ which was perfect for the hangover. The eggs were light and fluffy and the bacon was huge! The pancakes were delish as well. Could have done with some more syrup, but I was so full by the time I finished my first pancake that the syrup size worked out perfectly. Amazing food, amazing value, great service... new fav breakfast spot!",

I am just trying to keep you away from my favourite breakfast place in London. It gets quite crowded and if I say it's good... you will go and crowd it up too.. just like everyone else. Oh yes, also, the food is BIG. Look, it's good. Everything is good. I've had benedicts, omelettes, Yankee Doodles, Yankee Doodle Dandees, french toast, bacon, toast, salmon, spinach, coffee, orange juice, potatoes... but my favourite is the corned beef hash. Oy vay. I refuse to try anything off the lunch menu as I think that would just start me onto a downward spiral where I am always in this establishment. It would become my addiction and they would have to, at some point, ask me politely to leave. So, if you really need to go, then go. I can't stop you. But, if you don't go, you are missing something very Large and Yummy. Enjoy my friends... enjoy.",

Thankfully nobody did. The prices are good for the amount of food you are given. I had a veggie breakfast, and it was tasty. I didn't have a hangover, but if I did, this would be the perfect hangover busting food. The menu is extensive so lots for you to choose from, including more american breakfast/brunch options which I am sure are very popular.The guys cooking behind the counter were super friendly and smiley which I enjoy.

We wait in the queue.They ask us if we mind sharing a table. We don't, but the table they wanted to seat us at was wedged in front of a bit of wall that was jutting out, and I knew there was no way the two of us were going to fit there. So we waited a bit longer. This time they sat us at a table with a couple of Scottish guys. Wedged into the corner again. So don't expect a lot of room. There isn't. In fact, the tables and chairs are so close to each other it's awkward. Nava had the corned beef hash with juice, and I had the Yankee Doodle Dandy with coffee. Now they claim to serve unlimited coffee. First, the coffee is terrible. Second, there's no way to get refills as the servers NEVER COME BACK TO YOUR TABLES. Don't expect unlimited coffee like you get in the states. It's not like that at all.The food was mediocre. The french toast was pretty bad. White bread barely dredged through eggs so it was a bit dry in the middle. The American pancakes, while fluffy and light, were overcooked on the outside and almost burnt. My fried eggs were hard and overcooked. The corned beef (probably from a can) had the wrong beef-to-potato ratio. There were probably eight bits of potato in it. It really needed a lot of work.It was an unpleasant dining experience all around. At least it was cheap. I assume that British people like it because there's a queue, but for me not at all worth the wait.",
