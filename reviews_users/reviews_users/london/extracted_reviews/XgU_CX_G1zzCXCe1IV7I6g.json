    "text": "I like this place! So excited about it that I'm writing this review on the very night I visited, and I'm not even drunk! I like Hawksmoor. I have been to the Commercial road one, but it was too dark to get my vote. I like to see the array of reds on my beef fillet when I slice it open. This is a large cavernous restaurant, with no mobile phone signal! We came on a Thursday night, and although fairly empty when we arrived at 7pm, it quickly filled up. I found it amusing that in this area of the City, the only people dressed down were the serving staff. So to the food. We skipped hors d'oeuvres and went straight to beef fillet with a medley of potato dishes: beef fat fries, triple cooked fries and the mash in gravy. I also ordered creamed spinach. These were each very good in their own right; and in the end I had to get the table cleared because I just kept picking. If I were to be fussy, I would say the beef was over seasoned, but still exceptionally moist, juicy and perfectly medium rare. I then had the raspberry Eton Mess which was just gorgeous, and my friend had the Caramel chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The ice cream was to die for. Creamy but not rich, and very refreshing. I love Hawkmoor. I'm trying out Seven Dials next.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor these days has almost reached \"legendary\" status with its combination of prime steak and top notch cocktails. It has always been a debate among the Londoners which group has the best steak in town, Hawksmoor or Goodman. I tested for myself when I visited Hawksmoor Guildhall and went for the Porterhouse steak, the same cut I had when I was at Goodman. The Porterhouse was indeed pretty special, really moist and rich, but perhaps too smoky for my liking, and it wasn't as tender as Goodman. For almost \u00a350 per head, steak should be close to perfection, but that wasn't the case for me with Hawksmoor.",

The steaks are amazing \u00a0although I really did expect more from the waiter when I asked what the difference was between the porterhouse and the Chateaubriand. Telling me they are different cuts is like stating the obvious \u00a0and not being able to describe the differences in texture, as well as the fact that porterhouse includes two types of cuts, was slightly disappointing. The meat was beautifully cooked though \u00a0with just a hint of smokiness which tantalized my tastebuds. The cornflake milkshake is also quite unique! Triple cooked chips were nice, but average.

    "text": "I went to Hawksmoor with a friend for the famous Hawksmoor breakfast. The menu pointed out that it was for two people. Sadly the meal is padded with the unlimited toast and potatoes, with very little meat for what you're paying. The carbs fill you but not in an entirely satisfying way. There was also just one chop to share, which seems like a mistake for a meal meant for two people. Our drinks orders were also messed up and to at the end of it all we were charged a 12.5% \"optional\" service charge, however we were never given any option to pay it, it was just stuck on at the end of the bill. Basically all the prices on the menu are incorrect, everything actually costs 12.5% more than what it says. All in all I was disappointed with my experience at the hawksmoor and won't be returning.",

It wasn't nice.My friend and I went for the bone in prime rib. And it was good - three stars are perhaps due to very high expectations I had about it. It was slightly overcooked for medium rare.Desserts were great (toffee pudding and eton mess) - but I didn't go there for desserts!Honestly, I'm disappointed.

    "text": "Hawksmoor. It's rarely been doubted that the guys behind the two previous locations have been turning out some of the best steaks this side of Argentina. They've opened a third location just a stone's throw from Bank station. So what makes it special? A tasting menu and in true Hawksmoor fashion it's all about the meat.The tasting menu encompasses as much of the cow as they can and is composed of the following courses:1. Beef Tea2. Tongue and Tail Salad3. Oysters with Braised Short-Ribs & Kimchi4. Steak Tartare: Beef vs Veal5. Beef Shin Macaroni6. Bone-in Prime Rib, Porterhouse, Hawksmoor Sausages, Beef Dripping Chips7. Suet Sticky Toffee Pudding with Clotted CreamYou may be thinking 7 courses isn't really that much. I've had tasting menus that went on for over 20 courses (and that's not including those mid-meal palate cleansers that are all the rage these days). But Hawksmoor's \"tasting\" menu is more comparable to the Medieval Era feasts where a whole suckling pig (apple included) was considered an appetiser for one.First, let's set the tone for the meal. Bank is a perfect place for this bastion of meat and they've designed it to fit right in. You enter at street level and two beautiful girls greet you, take your name for the reservation (assuming you made one and didn't just drop by for a power lunch), and effectively relieve you of your coat and bag. Then you descend down a wide stair case and the bar area comes into view. Again, it's designed with a theme in mind and its full of deep dark woods and comfortable leather chairs. You can virtually picture the bankers of old in their three piece suits relaxing back with a good glass of Scotch and a thick cigar. So that's what I did. Minus the suit and cigar. And I was drinking Sazerac rye instead of Scotch. But it was basically the same thing.When you are finished with your pre-dinner drinks (and your group has finally all made it), a quick word to your waiter will get you to your table for dinner. In our case, we lucked out as they gave us the private dining room to apologise for rescheduling our reservation (it was in the soft opening and they had a kitchen fire the day we were supposed to go for dinner). The private room is tucked away at the back of a sizeable regular dining room (at a wild guess, I'd say there were around 30+ tables for at least 4 people). Normally, the room has a minimum spend of \u00a31,500 but we were lucky to have that waived. That being said, it might still be worth it if you had a larger party of 10+ people as it comes with the following: a dedicated waiter, pretty good sound insulation, built in sound system with iPod dock, and what looked like the ability to play movies on a projector. If you wanted to make a night of it, between food and drink you could probably spend \u00a375-100 per person without much trouble.Anyways, let's get to it. I'm not going to go through the menu individually, but stick with the highlights. The beef tea (served in a china cup) is a perfect amuse bouche for this full out meat assault. The taste itself isn't heavy as you might expect but more delicate with the high notes you get when you take that first bite of steak but no booming textural undertones of the actual meat. The end result is that you slurp it down happily and your steak craving shoots up to a whole new level. It does what every amuse-bouche aims for: gets you salivating and hungry for the meal.My favourite dish of the night was the beef shin macaroni, and I should add that I'm not a pasta person so I was actually dreading this one a bit. This is a massive dish that can easily feed 10+ people on its own, let alone as part of a 7 course tasting menu. I did mention earlier that Hawksmoor has its own ideas on what qualifies as a \"tasting\" dish. Essentially, it's about 1-2 pounds of elbow macaroni baked with a rich meaty sauce, bone marrow, and a 3 pound beef shin. Then you cover the whole thing with a good helping of melted parmesan (liberally cover it). You end up with this tangy rich cheesy dish with clumps of seared bone marrow and flaky chunks of shin meat. It's absolutely fantastic and we devoured as much as we could handle. And then there was still enough for me to take home and eat for 5 more meals. So good...I want it again!And finally, the suet sticky toffee pudding! I love sticky toffee pudding, like seriously love it, more than a fat kid loves chocolate cake (I was that kid...and still am). I don't know what exactly they did to it, but it was one of the best I've ever had. Rich, sweet, spongy, and incredibly decadent, I managed to finish mine in a heartbeat.For \u00a3700 for 8-10 people, it's not that unreasonable for some excellent food. My only issue would be that by the time you get around to the steak course, you are stuffed from the macaroni and can't really enjoy it. Which is a pity, as Hawksmoor does steak pretty damn well.",

    "text": "They've done it again.Those fine folk over at Hawksmoor have yet again come up trumps with their 3rd opening. I'd been to the other two before, a few times actually, and knew what was in store. The fact that 50% would be taken off the food bill had me excited for days. What would we do with this extra 50%!? Order twice as much of course.The same design team that crafted their Seven Dials restaurant has been at work again. The place is beautiful. Low lighting, treated wood and glass everywhere and a huge, open dining room. It felt like a cross between the grand rooms of the Titanic, and the sexiest of speakeasies.I knew what to expect from the menu - but it didn't stop me being wowed by the food. The steak was fantastic. I can't think of a better steak, anywhere, than their porterhouse cut. Between the 4 of us we ordered 2.6kg of streak. I kid you not. Topped up with 8 sides - all which were tasty. None more so than the field mushrooms and creamed spinach. Of course there are the famous chips. It'd be churlish not to indulge.They had a handy sommelier to advise us on our wine choice. Which we guzzled.We, somehow, found space for desserts - and why not, they were half price too - and can confirm they're very much worth a dabble. The popcorn sundae and peanut butter shortbread stood out. Oh and props for using Climpson and Sons coffee too.Another win for the Hawksmoor team. I'll be very happy to, and am already looking forward to it, returning again and paying 100% for my meal.",

    "text": "Ok, folks, let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. It's good, but not great (yet), and has some issues--least of which was the kitchen fire they had last week that put our soft opening booking on hold til last evening. The format is much the same as the Sevendials locale (hostess stand/coat check up top; bar and restaurant below), but about twice the size, and three times as loud.The good news is the food is very much the same. The burgers and steaks are still exceptional, as are the beef dripping chips. My friend and I both had the 300g fillet, hers medium and mine medium rare. Both cooked to perfection. However, my bearnaise was cold and kind of gelatinous. We also ordered the cauliflower cheese and brussels sprouts sides. The cauliflower was underseasoned and nothing to write home about. The sprouts were roasted to within an inch of their lives and were a sickly greenish-brown. Although the garlic seasoning was very good, any nutritional value there was certainly removed. The hubs' burger came with enough bacon to be its own meal, and he was more than delighted by this. He reported it excellent.As per usual, the cocktails were fantastic, and the wine selection very nice. The bar is a little larger with more seating than the Covent Garden location. Where the second location has a type of Bavarian hunting lodge feel, the larger dining hall (160 covers to be exact) has an off-putting cafeteria vibe. I think it's the higher ceiling, lack of sound-absorbing materials, and the wood-paneled walls that accomplish this. The biggest annoyance of the evening had to be repeating ourselves with louder and louder shouts across the table.Keeping in mind that it is their first week of regular service, I can't be too harsh about the waitstaff, who seemed rushed and often misheard our requests (this I also blame on the noise level). Our waiter also had no idea how to swipe my husband's American Amex on the card reader. Really? The whole place just seemed a little too hectic. Hopefully things settle down over the next few weeks.",

Get the salted caramel tart with popcorn ice cream, get one each, do not under any circumstances let the people you came with order a lesser dessert, try yours then hound you for ever more spoonfuls of this marvellous pudding!Ambience is a bit mixed, fine in the bar, but the restaurant feels like a nicely appointed office basement, which in truth is what it is or was.This place could so easily have been a 5 star come here before you die restaurant. \u00a0Figure on \u00a3100 per head, which would have been easier to swallow if the steaks had been as great as the people serving them. \u00a0They're good, but despite what it says on their website or menu about being the best in the country, they're not. Not by a country mile. \u00a0Texture fine, flavour lacking and perhaps not timed properly. \u00a0It's a steak restaurant and if I'm paying \u00a3100 to be here I want true beefy awesomeness and I'm sad to say, it didn't deliver so in the end, despite the great staff, great fries, great desserts, it's only a 3 star review. \u00a0Which is a shame really. \u00a0When you leave a place \u00a3100 lighter it really has to deliver on everything.",

Both so flavoursome and lined the stomach nicely for the main course. STEAK, and lots of it.We opted for the 1kg Bone-in Prime Rib and 900g Porterhouse steaks between four with a variety of sides. Carrots, brussel sprouts, onion rings, creamed spinach, triple fried chips, mushrooms, beef dripping chips, bernaise sauce and peppercorn sauce. This was a lot of food! It was a challenge that we stepped up to and demolished the lot. Highlight of the sides for me were the sprouts, beef dripping chips and the peppercorn sauce.After eating all that food we were presented with the dessert menu, and went for it again. Bramley apple pie with custard, Trinity burnt cream (creme brulee), Ice cream sundae and a chocolate dessert. The waiter also supplied a number of the ice-creams for us to try which was a nice touch.The waiter, Peter, was really knowledgeable and made a great wine suggestion to go with the meal. A great asset to Hawksmoor and a genuinely nice guy.Hawksmoor Seven Dials used to be my favourite restaurant in London, now it has some competition in Hawksmoor Guildhall!",

I was impressed with everyone I met \u00a0the booking team who were very helpful, the very knowledgeable and pleasant team who served us, and the team working away preparing the food all of which was absolutely delicious. The surroundings are traditional colonial style, plenty of table space and space between tables making it feel airy, but with a nice level of social buzz in the room. All this made for a most enjoyable evening that we'll remember for some time. I'd definitely recommend this place, and will be returning as soon as the opportunity allows.",

    "text": "I've been to my share of steak houses in the states and I have to say, dining here was a very unique experience! Hawksmoor is mentioned in a lot of \"where to eat in London\" type blog posts and was highly recommended by my friend who lives here so we decided to eat here for our first night in town and to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.First off, we started at the bar because we arrived early and our table wasn't ready yet. Our bartender was Will, I would recommend coming to Hawksmoor just to grab a drink from him! So so friendly and knowledgeable about the town, and incredibly detail oriented with the drinks he makes. Definitely recommend the old fashioned, it has a buttery caramel taste. By far and away the best old fashioned I've ever had.We were seated at a table with a great server as well, I forgot to get her name but awesome customer service and hilarious! We ordered the carpaccio and scallops to start. Carpaccio was the winner by a long shot. DEFINITELY get that, probably (again) the best carpaccio I've ever eaten. I wish I ordered an entire plate for myself.Ordered the chateaubriand cut and was not disappointed! Tender, flavorful meat. I will say though, I might even recommend ordering one level rarer than you usually order because it'll really cook on the hot dish they serve it on. We shared 900 g between 3 people and that was the perfect amount of meat.My friends also ordered a side of bone marrow to smother on the meat. Heard nothing but great things about that (I didn't try, not a fan of marrow).We were in a time crunch to leave to make it to our next reservation at sky pod bar so our server quickly settled the bill for us and even brought out a fancy box of chocolates for the birthday boy since we didn't have time to eat a dessert at the restaurant. I can't reiterate enough how impressed I was with their level of service! I would liken Hawksmoor to Mastro's in the states in regards to level of service and quality of food, but without the pretentiousness. So pleased with our meal there, I'd give them 6 stars if I could.",

It's one of the most important meals of the day and also one of my favourites.When I do breakfast, I like to go BIG and you don't go bigger than the breakfast at Hawksmoor.Now I'm sure you'll have heard all about their UNREAL steaks but did you know they also do breakfast? It's only available Monday to Friday and it's only served at the Guildhall branch and it's literally ah-mah-zing! I took Tom for his birthday as a little treat. As it was a treat and a friday and because they were called anti-fogmatics we started our breakfast with a cocktail. Who cares if it was only 9am?I went for the manliest drink of the menu with shaky pete's ginger brew, made from gin, ginger syrup, lemon and London Pride ale (\u00a39.75), while Tom went for the girly Marmalade Cocktail (\u00a39.50) In terms of breakfast. We were there for one thing and one thing only. The breakfast to end all breakfasts. The Hawksmoor Breakfast for two (\u00a335).It's made for two to share (clue is in the name) but it's enough to feed a small family for days! You get a huge smoked bacon chop, sausages, (made with pork, beef, & mutton), black pudding, short-rib bubble & squeak, grilled bone marrow, trotter baked beans (incredibleeee), fried eggs, grilled mushrooms, roast tomatoes, HP gravy and unlimited toast - and breatheee. It is quite literally huge and it tastes incredible! Bone marrow on toast was the highlight for me but the trotters beans were incredible too. Home-made smokey baked beans with pulled pork - seriously as good as they sound.  There are very few times Tom has not been able to finish a meal and this was definitely one of those times. I mean just look at the sheer size of it! If you're ever in the city mid-week, you should definitely stop by Hawksmoor for breakfast. If you're not quite up to the big breakfast challenge, there's loads on the menu to chose from including eggs benedict, steak and eggs and lighter options like grapefruit or granola.",

It was fantastic, and I quickly ordered a refill.Dinner was the beetroot salad to start, followed by the rib eye with onion rings. I would not put it in the \"best steak ever\" category, but everything was really good (especially those rings). Service was brisk & friendly, and it was a leisurely meal in a great atmosphere.

It's my go-to place for birthdays, and the Guildhall location didn't let me down at all. Between the starters (the fried oysters were decadent), all the sides, and the desserts, you'd almost forget there was also amazing steak. But of course, you can't forget. It's the best part!It's definitely not cheap - when is steak ever cheap really? So expect to spend a few pennies, but you won't be disappointed. Their best dessert is definitely the sticky toffee pudding, although the chocolate caramel \"rolos\" are also amazing. You won't find a specials board at this location, but rest assured, they have them - just ask your server if you want to get a bigger steak and share it. I've always found it's the best way to go, especially if you're a group of 4 or 5 and want to try a couple different cuts. So until next time Hawksmoor, I look forward to another celebration or reason to let myself eat way too much and not regret it.",

Awarding 5 stars almost seems stingy.I came here for a best friend's birthday party on my recommendation after the superlative experience I'd had at Hawksmoor Spitafields with the Yelp Steak Club. Right from the off, the service was friendly, polite yet also informal enough to put us at ease. As one of my friends there remarked, Hawksmoor seem to make a point of recruiting affable yet professional waiters and waitresses. This being a celebration, we ended up having a rather boozy dinner, kicking things off with a round of their excellent cocktails. Each was superb - I tend to be a cocktail sceptic, but the well-chosen combinations, quality of ingredients and sparing use of ice won me over. Then it was on to the wine. Despite the wtf prices (see photo) found at the higher end of the wine list (designed to prompt impulsive splurges from bonus-rich city boys?), Hawksmoor deserve a lot of credit for having a wine list that starts at under \u00a320 a bottle. We chose the second cheapest one, and it was perfectly decent.The steak, of course, was as heavenly as ever - pink, and melting in the mouth. We accompanied it with their triple-cooked chips and some veggies, all of which were excellent.Finally, the dessert. Having reassured my introverted friend that this was unlikely to be the place to bring attention to it being his birthday, once we were done with our mains, our waitress suddenly appeared with a sticky toffee pudding complete with candle and a personalised happy birthday greeting written elegantly in toffee sauce on the plate! I couldn't quite believe it. The place looks stunning too. Plenty of wooden panelling, leather chairs, low-lighting but at the same time quite restrained too: it's classy, but unpretentious. Refreshing.Next time I have something to celebrate or guests to wow? I'll be heading right here.",

    "text": "Visited the Hawksmoor on a Friday night and with its location close to the city it seemed to be full with a lot of people from the city. The place was packed so really glad we made reservations. Had a look at what people were eating around us and the dishes looked huge so we opted not to have any starters. We ordered some wine, many to choose from by the glass but had a difficult time finding anything that I fancied so asked for a recommendation. Was not bad but not great either so a bit disappointing. That can however not be said about the food, we went for the smallest cut they had which at this night was around 700 grams and shared that. We got side salads, fries and bearnaise sauce. The fries should be skipped - nothing special and still plenty of food. The meat was prepared exactly as requested (medium rare) and was both flavorful and extremely tender.The food was just so filling so there was no chance that we could have room for dessert but all together still very good food. To give the place a top grade the sides would however to be slightly better as well as the wine. The place is also too loud - to some extent it is the fact that it was full but also the fact that the music was fairly loud so people have to shout to make themselves heard. All in all still one of the best places for steak in London.",

    "text": "Never disappointed. I've been three times and every time is a treat. The cocktails are superb, as is the service and lastly, the steak is the best in London. In the three times I've been, I have had the chateaubriand which was literally melting in my mouth, the porterhouse which had great flavour and lastly, the t-bone which was cooked to perfection. The waiters are knowledgeable and don't 'sell' to you and the atmosphere is intimate and cosy. It's quite dark in the restaurant (low lighting) which adds to the ambience; saying that, I've only ever been in the evening but I hear their Sunday roast is equally as good as a steak. I would definitely recommend his place -- on a final note, it's pretty pricey.",

    "text": "Came here at 7am for a power breakfast with the coworkers in celebration of a milestone achievement, staying alive for 26 years. We paired up and everyone went for the Hawksmoor Breakfast - a selection of meats with sides paired to perfection. The presentation was amazing, the spread filling the entire table. All the meats came in a big griddle over hash browns, allowing a bit of the flavor of each to absorb into the potatoes.Smoked Bacon Chop (5/5) - very flavorful and a hearty chop at that. Two grown men could only manage about 1/2 of the serving.Sausages (3/5) - probably the most mediocre thing in the selection, but don't take that as insult. They were still far above average, it's just that among the company of giants the sausages fall a bit short.Hash Browns (5/5) - beautifully done. Didn't think that potatoes would outrank the meats, but the hash browns were probably my favorite selection from the breakfast. There was consensus around the table that these were very very well prepared.Bone Marrow (4/5) - bone marrow for breakfast is heavy. Only had a bit, and it was delicious.Mushrooms (4/5) - the necessary non-potato, non-meat to pair with an overwhelmingly meaty breakfast. Did the job, and did the job well.Black Pudding (-/5) - never made it this far. Looked decent but there was no room left.I will definitely find an excuse to have another power breakfast here. It did get quite packed by the time we left around 9am, so calling ahead for reservations might be the best way to secure a table.",
