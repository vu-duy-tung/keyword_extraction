The express lunches are the best value. \u00a35.50 for one course, \u00a37.50 for two and about a tenner for three. Considering I tried to drag everyone to Busaba down the road, I was pretty impressed with the prices here. I had ginger beef stir fry which cam with rice and a little salad and it was actually pretty nice. Could have done with a bit more of a kick though - I'm pretty sure if I'd have asked them to add chilli they'd have been fine with that. Everyone else curry was pretty yummy looking too They do coke in glass bottles too. For some reason it tastes better out of a glass bottle. Why? The food isn't as brilliant as Busaba, and there are a lot of Thai places around here, but if you can nab a table outside you're in a great celeb spotting place (no, we didn't spot any) and you can have a good feed over a long lunch.

I went at around 2pm on a Friday and within twenty minutes had the restaurant to myself which was pleasant. I ordered the following:- Drunken noodles with beefYou get a generous portion and a slice of lime which adds a nice kick. It was a bit too sweet for me however and could do with a bit more spice (although admittedly I didn't request extra chilli, which is something that can be done). The beef was the biggest disappointment, being far too chewy without the flavour to back it up. I don't mind having to chew as long as the taste is retained throughout. The problem with the beef here as with a lot of beef in general is that the flavour soon dissipates resulting in no reward for the chew.I think I could better spend the money elsewhere but if you're in the area, it's worth checking out.",

The desserts were amazing as well, even though they took a very long time to make them (over 20 mins after we're done with our food).Service: Like what? We finished our main dishes and waited a long time for our dessert. We didn't really mind it because we were having a good conversation. However, the guy just came to clean our table and put two new menus in our face with an attitude. We were really confused but he didn't give us a chance to ask any questions and left. Five minutes later, we got attention from another staff to say that we were waiting for our desserts. She was like \"oh, ok\" then took the menus away, not apologizing for the mistake or acknowledging our wait. Well, oh, ok.",

Delivery was quite prompt and my order was accurately delivered.I enjoyed the corn cakes and drunken pork rice. The chicken with cashewnuts had some pineapple in it which I wasn't expecting. The red curry was good, but didn't come with rice (I'm so used to rice being included with thai curries at restaurants back home)The pork with drunken bamboo shoots wasn't as exciting as I had hoped and used very thinly sliced lean cuts of pork which made it taste more like chicken.They don't deliver desserts home (probably because they all include ice cream?)",

My company was having a group order from this restaurant, and I ordered a pad see ew with dumplings. First of all, the dumplings are actually called shiu mai so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was pot stickers or gyoza. But WTHECK, I've never seen a Thai restaurant have that on the menu. Nevertheless, the shiu mai was the least of their worries. The pad see ew was soooo dry, the beef was chewy, there was weird veggies in it like bell peppers and onions. Traditional pad see ew should have egg and broccoli. Don't call it a pad see ew if that's not what you're going for. Again, i'll let that go if the food was decent. But it's not. The noodles were dry and tough and the bee seemed old. I would never in my life come back to this place.",

    "text": "So my housemate and I travelled to Thailand two years ago and ever since have been trying to reclaim the smells and sensations of eating this cuisine on a beach in thirty degree temperatures, back home in London - this my friends, is not possible.However, the taste and freshness of the ingredients from Thai Metro were some of the best we've had since being back. The Panang curry was plentiful in beef, the flavours were spot on and the portion size was wonderful for two, paired with the coconut rice (if you're feeling extra naughty, this stuff could be dessert on its own, it's so delicious with some sesame seeds through it for extra yum!) We had the pad thai, which seemed to taste different in every place we visited in Thailand anyway, but this had its crushed nuts to the side and a wedge of fresh lime to squeeze over, loads of beansprouts, plenty of moist and delicate chicken and not too oily - we were, well, impressed! Because we were hungover from our Galentine's Day we decided no food could be enough, so ordered the bamboo, chilli and thai basil stir fry with prawns as well! Don't judge us. We split the one portion of rice with this and the curry, there were six perfectly cooked king prawns swimming in a spicy, delicate (not oily) sauce, with bamboo shoots, peppers and onions, really another lovely mix of flavours - we chose well even if I say so myself! To top it all off, 'cause we love a nibble, we had their thai prawn crackers and sweet chilli dip - well, I don't think I need to convince anyone that these are always a good idea! Fast delivery, hot, fresh food and wonderful flavours that bring you back to Thailand even when your thailand pants and you are sitting on your sofa!",

It's a positive thing.In actuality, we were planning on going to the sushi spot across the street - his recommendation - but there was a 45 minute wait, so we looked out the door and said, hmm, how about Thai? And there you have it.Prices were low - the true barometer of a good Thai restaurant, in my opinion - if they are high, run away! It will not be any good! I ordered the yellow curry (chicken) with white rice. No brown rice in the house, they said. Boo to that. Chicken Satay and Green Papaya Salad for appetizers. Boss man got some noodle dish that I guess I didn't pay attention to.Small restaurant, kind of loud, but good food, served quickly, in a cool area. I'd go back for sure. Thai Metro.

As for desserts, we had the pandan sticky rice with coconut ice cream and coconut pancake with vanilla ice cream. They are oh so heavenly!! Though it doesn't taste the same with what you can have in Thailand but they make it so special for you so you won't forget it easily. Ice creams are homemade and I would recommend the coconut one. Everything tasted so wonderfully and I will definitely go for a second, third or more trip to this food heaven.",
