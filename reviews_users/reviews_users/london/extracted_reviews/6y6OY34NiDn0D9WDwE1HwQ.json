    "text": "What can I say this is my favourite Singapore/Malaysian restaurant in London. No doubt I can get better food back home (Singapore), but this is as good as it gets in London, and standards aren't bad at all. When I'm craving for a bite of street food from Singapore, I zip down to C&R for a cheap and cheerful meal. They do a very good Laksa (for me, this is even better than the ones I find back in Singapore..), the coconut gravy is just right - not too thick, but fragrant enough, and bits of beansprouts, fish cakes and fishballs, prawns and chicken add a nice interesting texture into each mouthful of vermicelli noodles. I love their Wat Tan Ho - they've done a fabulous job of frying the horfun (flat rice noodles) first, so that it is more tasty. The thick gooey gravy with prawns, fishcakes, squid and vegetables goes perfectly over the rice noodles, creating a perfect bland of harmony. Another one of my favourite orders. The Hokkien Noodles (with black sauce) is as authentic as it gets in some parts of Malaysia. C&R does this perfectly, and again.. it's one of my favourites. In fact, I'm spoilt for choice every time I go to C&R. They do a very decent Hainanese Chicken Rice, the Roti Chennai is excellent too (although portions are a tad small) and from time to time, I've tried their Prawn Noodles, which is decent, although not truly comparable with the ones I get from back home. I'd avoid dishes like the Phad Thai, as this is not a Thai Restaurant The Ipoh Horfun tends to be bland, so I haven't ordered it since I tried it some time back. C&R is a place to go for street eats from Singapore/Malaysia - if you've ever been to the region, you'll appreciate the wide variety of food offered from this small cafeteria. Don't expect great service - like most Chinese restaurants in the area, service can be a little brusque, however.. if you know anything about street food dining, then you'll know this is very typical behavior from hawkers in Singapore/Malaysia. People don't go to C&R for service, they go there for the excellent food, whenever they miss home style food. Prices range between \u00a35-8 for a main course, and you can even get drinks like home made barley, lemonade, and teh tarik (milk tea) from this neat little joint.",

You suddenly feel like you are in some South -East Asian quick diner eatery with ugly, plain furniture crammed into the small space so you find yourself sitting very close to fellow customers. The menu serves an extensive mish mash choice of Malay, Singaporean and Thai dishes. With such so many dishes to choose from the food can be quite hit and miss. The curries are generally a good choice. We had their lamb curry with chunky potatoes and a rich creamy sauce in which we dunked pieces of roti in to soak it up. Their Hainan chicken rice, a favourite dish of mine, was done pretty well too. Whether it is my cup of tea or not, it is a popular haunt, and don't be surprised if you find yourself having to cue up and wait for your turn to be seated.",

Das Restaurant selbst hat 2 Etagen, Erdgeschoss und Untergeschoss, oben ists definitv gem\u00fctlicher. Naja, gem\u00fctlich ist so eine Sache, denn die sp\u00e4rliche Einrichtung und recht unbequemen St\u00fchle lassen keine wirkliche Gem\u00fctlichkeit aufkommen. Es ist ziemlich busy, starker Andrang. Die Speisekarte ist lang und bietet viel Auswahl. Wir haben uns f\u00fcr Singapur Laksa und Indian Mee Goreng entschieden. Dazu ein Bier und einen Tee. Das Bier kam warm und statt des bestellten Jasmintees wurde ein anderer gebracht. Die Bedienung nahm es gleichg\u00fcltig, keine Rede von sorry. Die Gerichte kamen ca. 10min hintereinander - auch nicht so sch\u00f6n. Und f\u00fcr Bezahlung mit Trinkgeld (\u00fcber das ich mich jetzt noch \u00e4rgere) gab's auch kein Dankesch\u00f6n. F\u00fcr den miesen Service (Service???) gibts klaren Punktabzug. Bei besserem Service h\u00e4tte ich 4 Sterne vergeben. Zum Essen selbst: Das Laksa enthielt ziemlich viel leckeres Seafood und chicken, da wurde nicht gespart. Auch Nudeln waren viele drin, zu viele um sie alle aufzuessen (und ich war hungrig!). Geschmacklich wars gut, f\u00fcr mich etwas zuviel Kokosnussmilch-lastig, dadurch auch sehr nahrhaft, ich h\u00e4tte es gern etwas sch\u00e4rfer/w\u00fcrziger gehabt. Das Mee Goreng war ebenfalls sehr reichhaltig, das Tofu jedoch etwas auf der trockenen Seite. Und wieder h\u00e4tte es geschmacklich etwas intensiver sein k\u00f6nnen, war aber vom Grundgeschmack her lecker. Daher f\u00fcrs Essen 4/5, denn es war gut, aber nicht hervorragend; die Portionen waren reichlich und vom Preis her war's auf jeden Fall ok: 6,50 Pfund - da kann man sich wirklich nicht beschweren.",

    "text": "Being from Malaysia, I'm obviously biased towards Malaysian food but I feel that if Thai food can so successfully penetrate the British food scene, Malaysian food should also be able to do the same. Malaysia is a cosmopolitan melting pot of culture, ethnicity and religion and its diversity is reflected in its food with influences from its main 3 races - Chinese, Indian and Malay (Arabic) with nods also to our time as Portugese, Dutch and British colonies.I will always be eternally grateful to C&R for blazing the trail for Malaysian food in Chinatown. It was the first decent restaurant to which I could take friends for a proper Malaysian meal and not be embarrassed. I'm glad to report that business remains brisk and they've been successful enough to open a second branch in Bayswater, which I haven't eaten at yet.The menu consists mainly of Malaysian hawker food favourites. Hawker food is street food where street stalls compete fiercely for custom with their delicious smell and sights. If you ever visit Malaysia, ignore the guidebooks, take some simple precautions, stick to the cooked food and you'll be in foodie heaven when you explore the hawker food scene. You'll be really missing out if you don't try this aspect of Malaysian food.Well, in C&R cafe, you can try these dishes in safe hygienic surroundings! For Malaysian food virgins, perhaps have the satay (meat or seafood skewers served with peanut sauce) or ketoprak (mixture of vegetables with slightly spicy peanut sauce). The Hainanese chicken rice taste belies its simple poaching cooking technique. Char koay teow is my personal favourite - wok fried broad rice sticks with meat and seafood. I am very fussy about my char koay teow and there are better versions to be had in London these days but this delivers a good idea of the best of hawker food. Nasi lemak is a good combination on a plate option - coconut rice with curry chicken, crispy anchovies, boiled egg, spicy vegetable sambal and peanuts. Ice kacang or chendol will close out the meal with something cool and sweet.It's down a little side street off Wardour St but it's a little gem.",

    "text": "Walking down the skinny passageway that is Rupert Court one bitterly cold January morning, I passed a caf\u00e9 with an enormous bubble tea menu plastered along its fa\u00e7ade. And I thought to myself, 'What better time for a cold, refreshing beverage than now?'So I went in.And it smelled. It smelled stagnant and bad. I saw one man behind the counter wearing washing-up gloves, dismembering chicken carcasses with a meat cleaver. He looked at me.I looked at him.Against my better judgment, the words, 'I'd like a regular bubble tea, please', came out of my mouth. I'd interrupted this man as he was hacking apart chickens with a rather sizeable knife. I'd come this far; there was no backing out now.He looked at me.I looked at him.He put down the cleaver and chicken leg. He removed his washing-up gloves. He paced around for a moment, bemused, and then asked me to wait. \u00a0He left the disused caf\u00e9 that smelled of dead chickens. And entered the restaurant of the same name across the small alleyway. I stood. I didn't know what do to. I saw him speaking with a woman working behind a small bar in the restaurant who was not covered in salmonella.I was relieved.I left the caf\u00e9 and entered the restaurant. Apologised for the mix-up (although, to be fair, the caf\u00e9 did have an enorous bubble tea menu plastered across its window). Waited for the lovely, non-chicken-cutting woman to make me my bubble tea.I paid my money (a lot of it, from what I recall) and left with my wonderfully appropriate winter-time drink.The tea tasted all right, although it was a bit on the sickly sweet side. But the tapioca pearls were simply too big for the straw provided. They continually got stuck, which required great concentration on my part not to suck up one of these pearls in my great haste to consume it, which would ultimately end in the pearl's lodgment it in my oesophagus (and my subsequent death) due to the force of the suckage required to release the pearl causing great momentum. It was a minefield.In short: I probably wouldn't go back for the bubble tea.",

    "text": "Two of my friends, both Malaysian, took me here on two seperate occasions, promising the best Malaysian food in London.... well they should know! So when we were looking for an alternative emergency laksa location (having been cruelly moved away from the beloved banana tree by work), I took two new visitors here. Things to love: the sweet condensed milk coffee and tea. I love the stuff, and I've yet to find it anywhere else nearly as good, frothy on top and hideously bad for you. Yum yum. Roti Canai. Dear god this bread is good. Again, hideously bad for you, but perfectly flaky and pastry-like with a sauce that has the perfect amount of kick. The satay is the best you'll have anywhere, in particular the prawn and noodle satay dish - can't remember its name - is superb.Sadly, I found the laksa too fishy for my taste - it's probably more authentic, but I prefer banana tree's pure coconutty version. However, it was good and tasty, with nice fat prawns, and could easily have fed two people. My advice is to stick with the malaysian dishes - the pad thai looked a very strange colour though got a good review from its eater - and watch out for those little chilis on the menu that mean 'hot'. They MEAN hot!Service was friendly and fast, though let us linger over some Tigers even in the canteen quick-turnaround atmosphere. Perfect place for a quick and tasty dinner - I was full for under a tenner if you don't count the beers! It's tucked away down an alley but don't overlook it in favour of some hit n' miss Chinese places in this part of town.",

That sounded really weird despite my acquired taste for other things.I nearly chickened out and said I would order my own dessert, but once the spoon hit that shaved ice and syrup, I was a convert. This stuff is amazing. Forget how it looks, it tastes wonderful despite it being a cold November evening, we ate the whole thing. Sweetcorn and all. Well, my French friend did, rather than me!

On my first visit here, we were a group of 8 ... and Yee Gan ordered a variety of dishes (probably more than 10 in total) for all of us. I really liked the noodles. There was an \"Indian noodles\". The taste was nothing remotely Indian ... it was just spicy ... and very good. I also enjoyed the broad rice noodles with a variety of meat (this one is called Char koay teow, is it not ? ... Yee Gan, please confirm). The nasi-lemak, with its tasty and spicy chicken curry (with bones though) was fabulous. There was another dish which comprised of a boiled (and somewhat bland) chicken dish with fragrant rice and chilly sauce. I like this too ... but what i would have enjoyed the most is this rice with the curry of nasi-lemak. We also had beef rendang (a curry) and chicken skewers with peanut sauce. None of the dishes were disappointing.On my second visit i seemed to think that a number of the same preparations seemed to contain a lot more bones in the meat. I am not sure whether we could have ordered boneless versions or not.The quantity is good. One main course should be enough for a person under most circumstances ... but if you are really hungry then you might be able to manage 1.5. The prices are exceedingly cheap ... a stomach-full of food and drink costs no more than \u00a311-\u00a312 per person. I surely want to be back here ... but since it has a somewhat limited vegetarian selection, it might be a challenge getting my veggie friends ... but i shall try.",

They fill up the main restaurant where all the food is cooked, then put the remaining people in the shop opposite which is also owned by them. Requiring them to carry your food out into the street, into the alleyway onto you table. Quite funny to watch in practice.The portions here were gigantic but the quality was a mixed bag. We ordered a curry laksa, which was extremely authentic and had plenty of seafood, prawns, chicken etc... However the Char Kway Teow, which also tasted authentic had lots of fishcake but only a single, sad lonely prawn on it's own in the whole dish. Consistency seemed to be lacking.The Nasi Lemak didn't taste authentic, but all the ingredients were there and they made a fair go with their DIY Sambal chilli sauce which was pretty good (but not authentic). The Hokkien Mee was huge, but swimming in way too much sauce/broth, plus was a little salty.In essence, the food is quite good, but not uniform in quality. If you're Malaysian, you're probably initially be quick appreciative of the food, then afterward criticise things that were not up to scratch. Probably a place to try again, but it's fills up quickly and they don't take reservations, so get there early or be prepared to wait.",

    "text": "C&R is my usual haunt to satisfy those Malaysian food cravings that go a bit cray-cray every now and then. What I love about C&R is that it doesn't try to be anything that it's not. It's got an extensive menu of authentic food and drink, whole portions (as supposed to half-sized) and the food is quite satisfying. It does the job.My usual orders are the curry laksa, roti, nasi lemak, chicken curry, hainanese chicken rice, wat dan ho (no idea what this is in English it's flat noodles in a thick sauce with fishball slices, meat and veg, it's got it all). The curry laksa - for me, this is always spot on, the flavours are wonderul and the bowl is filled to be brim. The curry laksa at C&R is the best curry laksa I've had anywhere, if it's a cold winter evening, this is the only place for laksa. Massive fan. I'm gonna show my cards and admit I've never had roti canai in Malaysia, but if I were to, I'd want it to taste like it does at C&R. Just on the laksa and roti I'd happily give it 5 stars, although the roti is slightly overpriced - I've also heard rumours that they're ridiculous over at Makan on Portobello road, more on this another time?The nasi lemak here is good too, the fish is toasted until it's flavourful and crunchy - just how I like it, there's never enough sauce, but that's probably cos I'm a sauce guy. The chicken curry experiences the reverse problem, too much curry to rice ratio, it also varies sometimes and I've had it a bit flat at times, the curry doesn't have enough kick and that's always sad.I probably get the hainanese chicken rice the most. I always end up getting it when I'm torn because of the massive menu. The rice could be more fragrant although both the soya sauce in the rice and the chili dipping sauce are exceptionally well made. The chicken also varies in quality, although I think they've switched to organic, which is the only way to have your hainanese chicken. I'm a massive fan of coriander, so no complaints on this front either. second qualm is the quantity of chicken - for \u00a37.50, I like to think I deserve a whole chicken - is that wrong?Wat dan ho is spot on if you know what you're getting yourself into, it's like a slimey plate of noodles and everything else they could find in the fridge. It's a typical Malaysian / Hong Kong dish. It's massive here at C&R and capable of filling a young family - good thing too because I'm starting to think I've got one growing inside of me.Quick note on the drinks - they're authentic but probably not to everyone's palate, try them all! Summary of the things that docked stars: The nasi lemak is a tad too dry, not enough chicken in the Hainanese Chicken Rice, roti canai's a bit expensive, and MINIMUM CHARGE of \u00a37.50 per head, why? just... why?",

    "text": "As with any other country-specific foods, I suppose, where there is a 'correct' taste to these dishes, it was the authenticity of the vibrant Malaysian flavours which I was eager to judge during my dining experience at C&R in Chinatown.C&R boasts an extensive menu of all the Malaysian/Singaporean favourites, from *real* Singapore Fried Noodles to nasi lemak, from chendol to ice kacang. And they just had to, had to, had to throw in the Asian-dining-in-Europe quintessential: Pad Thai.The portions are exceptionally huge for some reason, but it makes me feel alright about spending \u00a36.50 on my mountain of mee siam which is SG$3.50 (\u00a31.75) in Singapore for a more sensible portion.It's a little unfair, but my mum makes the best mee siam in the world, so I can't say that this dish was brilliant. Unlike the version served in a milky, spicy soup back home, this is the original 'dry' version which is truly Malaysian. These noodles were surprisingly spicy for my standards, let alone for the poor tongues of the British. I downed the iced Milo in the background quickly, but the spiciness lingered. Before the chilli became torturous, I did enjoy the noodles, which were tasty enough with a fragrance of bean-paste, and came with prawns, tried tofu, beansprouts, fried egg and some veggies. If I'm not wrong, the lemon wedge should have been a lime instead.Char kway teow is also another extremely popular dish of Malaysia and Singapore. It is described as 'broad rice noodles stir-fried with egg, prawn, fishcake and bean sprouts.' This dish was actually of the average Singaporean standard, but then again, with black sauce, everything usually comes out okay. I'm glad they added in the chives, which are necessary for a great taste and texture contrast, together with the crunchy bean sprouts, an added yay-factor.I definitely recommend sharing one dish between two diners, (unless you're a big guy/not having dessert/skipped breakfast/trying to gain weight) or taking away the leftovers. (Additional cost of 50p) Singaporeans and Malaysians will rejoice at this eatery which serves all our authentic local favourites at a good value.",

Crispy fried anchovies, curry, and super hot sambal. Super tasty food, Gigantic portions, reasonable prices - what's not to love?

(we made it up through the shopping and getting as much free stuff as poss.)We needed dinner, and this was gone 9pm. (We stopped off at the apple store to charge our phones- necessary!) and also to meet my mum after some meeting she had. Anyways, when we finally got there, it was STILL packed out and people were still queuing to get in. (We called ahead but they wouldn't sit us until we were all here) And I can see why, it's the closes thing you get to malaysia, this side of the world. Their Roti Canai sauce was so fragrant and heavenly, I loved it!. Ioved the laksa and wished I could eat more, if it wasn't for the amazing amount of chilli they put in. It was beyond spicy, (not quite at crying ma la stage, but nearly there) I could only manage a small amount but the flavour was great! The belachan veggies were really nice too, it wasn't overcooked! I highly recommend it as a side dish! The nasi lemak was nice but I would have like my iblis (anchovies) to be crispier but that might be because it's quite late at night. The crux of the dish- the sambal, I've had much better in my life, but it wasn't bad. We also got dessert because I wanted my friend to try cendol before she left for malaysia for holiday. It was super yummy! (Not too keen on the floury pandan bits) but condensed milk and ice with sugar is ALWAYS a win.",

The food tastes like a combo of homemade and canteen, firmly hitting that 'student comfort food' spot. I feel like Rasa Sayang tries to go there but ends up falling flat, while C & R nails it. Portions are big, prices are okay (you're paying for location), but the food is great. Nasi lemak is really solid and sambals are burningly delicious. While some stuff is gently Westernised, it really is gentle; if you don't have a clue what you're looking at on the menu, you're on your own. Spices are spicy, dried pungent fish is plentiful, and you're not going to leave hungry.",

    "text": "A malaysian restaurant that is always full of customers no matter what time of the day it is so prepared to wait if you come at rush hour. Decor is simple, a good representation of restaurants in China with rows of tables and chair that can be pushed together to accommodate groups. Comfortable lighting and efficient staff. Food is surprising quick yet tasty and large portions too. Reasonable pricing and a recent refurbish of their menu adding a few new dishes. What is not to like?We started with a glass of Teh Tarik, Malaysian tea, delivered hot and foamy like they poured it from a height which is how it's suppose to done. It was incredibly rich and milky from the condensed milk. It was a bit strong like they've left the tea bag in it although I like my tea strong so it worked out well for me.Lo MeeMy sort of comfort food. Egg noodles in a lovely thick starchy broth. It was flavoured beautifully with soy, vinegar \u00a0and the pork, mushrooms, carrots and other vegetables that had been braising in there helping to deliver complexity in sweetness as well as savouriness. The noodles did soften a little, being left to cool whilst we enjoy the other dishes but it didn't ruin the dish for me. The thick soup kept in the heat throughout and excellent at clinging on every strand of noodle as I mopped up the dish. Pork was a cheap cut being a bit chewy but that was reflected on the price and the type of restaurant. But with a little extra chewing it was very edible. Hainanese chicken riceA lovely home comfort dish of a poached chicken and then using the stock to cook the rice. Don't expect the highest grade of rice as we were served long grain but it was lovely, subtle in sweetness and fragrant from the chicken and somewhat peppery too. The corn fed chicken of course stole the show being incredibly tender and succulent, packed full of flavour from being poached in the salted water, ginger and onions. Serve with a spicy chilli dip if you like it hot.Rice cakes. Lovely steamed cubes of rice cakes made with rice flour then stir fried with beansprouts, spring onions, fried shrimps and soy sauce. They were beautifully charred around the edges conveying good wok energy, seasoned perfectly and great textures coming together from the soft sticky rice cakes to the crunchy beansprouts. Gado gado. This was very disappointing. The tofu was hard and rough as if it's been frozen and they refried. The peanut sauce on top was mediocre, very sweetened although I did enjoy the nuttiness. It was mainly the peanut sauce that gave this dish flavour as all the tofu, boiled eggs, cucumbers and beansprouts underneath came unseasoned and were terribly bland. Kind of wish they gave us more sauce now. As the prawn crackers were the only part that delivered its own flavour, we demolished them first. This dish should not have cost us \u00a37.00.Other than that last dish that let us down C&R has always been very reliable choice. I would recommend skipping the starters which are usually lazily made beforehand, bland and uninspiring. Just go straight into the main meal, especially their one bowl dishes which are all generously portioned. I have never had a problem with their seasoning. Menu is very extensive which can be overwhelming but at the same I find it an advantage as it caters for everyone and I know I can return often without being bored of the menu. Probably my most visited restaurant in London.",

    "text": "I used to frequent Melati on Peter St but when it closed, I tried C&R and it has become my Msian spot in London on my trips there. Service is friendly, menu is highly varied with the most typical Msian dishes. My favourite is the Nasi Lemak (although the acar that comes as a side isn't that good), the Char Kway Teow, the Prawn Sambal, kangkung belacan. The Mee Siam is pretty good, too, although I prefer stronger flavours. The satay is a little weak, as itsn't barbecued on a grill, it is made from breast meat hence it isnt as juicy and tender, and the seasoning is not the best. We were 5 and the bill came to about 80\u00a3 for 6 dishes. A good deal either ways!",

Food: I always go for the Singapore Laksa when I'm here. You can never go wrong with a laksa, and the portion is massive. The broth is packed with coconut and curry flavours that goes great with all the seafood and noodles in it. Every bite is heaven to me. That being said, I think the menu provides a great selection of south east Asian cuisine and it's worth to try out as many other yelpers have. Atmosphere: Typical Asian \"canteen\" style. Wooden chairs and tables and cramming as many people in as possible. It's just all part of experience.... if you can't go to Malaysia, go to C&R Cafe. Service: Don't expect 5 star service when you're here. It is, after all, in China Town. They are consistent and simple in their service. They'll seat you, take your order, and the food arrives in a very prompt manner.",

We had several dishes here that i tried which were tasty but oily of course - it's Asian!Spicy fried rice with egg was really good. Hainan chicken with rice is pretty far from it. More like a soy sauce chicken with no ginger. Boo :(Flat noodles with veggies (bean sprouts) - yum! Roti canai - oily pancake. The dip was good though Fresh squeezed juice - delicious. Had the apple, carrot, pear juice I think. Overall, I would come back as it had an extensive menu and reasonable prices along with a clean environment.",

    "text": "I've been to C&R many times and it's always a good experience food-wise, especially if you want something very filling for a decent price and for something that you can eat in under 40 minutes - it's a cafe after all but probably the most fancy Malaysian Cafe you'll ever go to in China Town. There is upstairs seating which houses parties over 6 but given the relatively small area, it's not advisable to stay here any longer. The customers are all very quick to eat and go. This time I ordered the legendary Malaysian Lamb Curry at \u00a38.50. Unfortunately, this does not come with the rice like the other curry dishes (e.g. Chicken) so you do have to ask for it. The lamb is nicely cooked and tender. The dish also comes with large chunks of potatoes which have been spiced with star aniseed so there's a lot of taste which promises to be more than your average takeaway curry. The service was very quick although, and whilst my order was completely fine, the staff did manage to get my friend's order wrong (both drinks and dish) even when apparently shown the number on the menu. This may be a cause for concern but they did offer to recook the dish so points for admitting their mistaken. To be fair, this is the first time in many times that something like this has happened that I'd still recommending going.",

To be fair, I think this is almost as good as one can get- a lot of Chinese Malaysian dishes taste different when they are not cooked with charcoal. I've sampled Char Kuey Teow, Wat Dan Hor, Lo Bak, and three-layered coffee from C&R. Char Kuey Teow and Wat Dan Hor lack \"wok hei\", or the aroma you get from great frying skill and preferably fried with charcoal. I like Lo Bak, though- very crispy and succulent. The coffee was fine. C&R is almost always packed, but their customers usually don't linger long after eating so you can get a table very rapidly (within 5 min). Service was OK, though I would prefer if the servers smile a lot more.",
