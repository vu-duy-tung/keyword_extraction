We can back and went downstairs to an obnoxiously lit basement room with tables of empty cereal bowls. We went back up to order our food and the cashier was extremely short with us, especially when I asked for a receipt. She told me that I had to wait for her to help other customers (even though the line was not that long). Then we got our cereal, which was good but how hard is it to pour cereal in a bowl and cut up some bananas. Then the \"maltshakes\"... it was so bad, a friend and I were splitting it and we couldn't even finish it. It was essentially lukewarm peanut butter milk soup. I went up to see if we could get something and I explained that it was not good and she just looked at me and said \"ok\". We left unsatisfied and angry. It was kitschy and cute, but definitely not worth the trip.",

We were really lucky as we ordered and sat down just as a rush of people came in.The cafe is a little overwhelming as there are cereal boxes all over the walls. I was so excited I could barely read the menu. After what felt like an eternity I picked Reese's Puffs as I'm obsessed with Reese's Pieces and anything peanut butter flavour. The milk selection is very impressive, I was very conservative and had semi-skimmed milk. We managed to get a table upstairs but it's tight when there's a queue. There's seating down stairs but I have no idea if it's more spacious.I really like it here and I don't care if everything I like will rot my teeth!",

In all my trips to London I'd never been anywhere near this area...Wow. \u00a0Anyway, Cereal Killer itself was very interesting, and for a restaurant based solely on cereal, man it was packed. The staff worked hard though and the line moved quickly. The space is tight, but there's additional seating downstairs. The custom creations, like Unicorn Poop, are very well thought out and taste great. \u00a0They also have tons of add-ins like flavored milks and various fruits. If you're considering this place, then you obviously understand it's not for the diabetic. The sugar content in most concoctions is through the roof! That aside, Cereal is definitely worth a visit.",

Well the initial impact when you walk in has the desired effect. Colourful cereal boxes on the shelves, showing us the funky favourites and the cute character cereals that remind you of your childhood. Every cartoon character you could think of on a cereal box, art work made from cheerios and cereal themed merchandise. The Place is small and the service was a little slow considering they only have to pour cereal into a bowl, but the \"cocktails\" are a fun way to get a sugar rush-Lucky charms, golden nuggets, twinkie and your choice of milk all in one bowl!The decor is really well done with all kinds of toys found in cereal boxes and 90's tv shows, the Fun factor has been the focus here.There is no shortage on choice, any cereal from peanut butter crunch to healthy granola, real milk, strawberry, soya, hazelnut...RED VELVET POPTARTS!I really appreciated that they served your choice of milk in a little class bottle rather than just pouring it on to your cereal, then you didn't have to have soggy cereal- a major bonus!All good things aside...Let's be honest... \u00a35 for cereal is pushing it but it wouldn't be a regular thing, this is a place to go once in a while with friends, maybe take a friend visiting there and hit brick lane at the same time. I definitely won't be rushing over there when I get a craving for cereal, but for a fun thing to show visitors it does the job.",

Service was quite slow though. You can either choose a cereal, milk, and toppings or choose one of their cereal \"cocktails\", which basically means a mash up of their own creation. I went with the chocopotamous for \u00a34.75. I forget exactly but chocolate with a side of milk. A yummy treat since I haven't eaten cereal in a while but I wouldn't necessarily make my way here again. Fun to visit and a \"must try once in your life\" but it's just cereal in the end.",

They offer non-traditional milks as well, such as almond, soy, and even a banana-flavored one. I didn't get a bowl since it was sort of pricey (4 quid for a normal-sized bowl). American cereals are on one side of the wall, and British cereals are on another. They also have display shelves with vintage cereal boxes, which were pretty cool to look at.Tl;dr - expensive cereal, but a novel place to check out.",

    "text": "I know the concept of paying loads (\u00a34+) for a bowl of cereal is silly.. but I still really wanted to check out Cereal Killers cafe and I'm not sorry I did! The decor is really cool, old school cereal boxes all over the walls and fridge-magnet style board menus to peruse whilst in the queue. There are so many options that the queue time barely feels like long enough to make a decision. I eventually had 'unicorn poop' which was a cereal cocktail of party rings, rice crispies, little marshmallows, sprinkles and a big dollop of marshmallow spread in the middle. And a little bottle of semi-skimmed milk, although you can swap that for loads of different flavours (chocolate, caramel etc.) It was truly delicious! When I went it was packed and there wasn't a huge choice for seats, I ended up at a table with my friends right next to the queue, which was a bit awkward as people kept gawking at our cereals whilst deciding themselves. If this place calmed down a bit then it would be a really lovely little kooky cafe for an all-american cereal treat. I had a lovely time and will come back if all the hype ever dies down!",

The menu was great fun and we decide to opt for their cereal cocktails - I got the lion king (lion cereal/coco caramel shreddies/mars mix/caramel milk), certainly a lot sweeter than what I normally get for lunch.Although it may be the most expensive bowl of cereal you've had, it might be worth it if not just for the novelty but for the perfect instagram food porn pic.",

I'm travelling and this neighborhood had a completely different vibe from the central London I just became accustomed to. The cafe has a great underground/independent vibe and I loved it's quirks. The cereal menu is extremely diverse and flexible for dietary restrictions with signs for vegan and lactose options.My criticism comes from the extremely long wait time and poor hygiene. I was the first in line and I stood waiting for too long (at a cereal bar, believe it or not!) Apparently they (as in the ONE staff member) prioritize deliveries over the person who has been standing in front of them for 30 minutes. The place was also not very clean; the tables smelled of dirty rag and the cutlery was not washed well.If you are a princess (like myself) I recommend sucking it up, because (despite everything I've said) this cafe was a cool experience and I recommend trying it out on a day out with your friends!",

    "text": "YES. This place nails it. It is an awesome cereal cafe, everything you hope it will be it actually is. Basically, you can do whatever you want. They have about one hundred cereals, mostly American and British, but several from around the world. They have around 20 types of milk and non-dairy alternatives. And they also have about 25 toppings. Pick any and all cereals you want, pick your size, choose a milk type, and then add your toppings. Yes, you can mix and match cereals in one bowl. Or not. Up to you.Too overwhelmed by the infinite possibilities to pick? Then just choose one from their cereal cocktails. These are their suggestions of various combinations to try.Tried the \"trife up your life\" - rice krispies with jelly, whipped cream, fresh strawberries, hundreds and thousands served with custard milk. Oddly enough, it worked and wasn't too sweet. Even refreshing in a way! And the custard milk is definitely unique - it's like sweetened milk.In case that wasn't enough, they have all kinds of retro sodas, although I was sad they no longer have Tab. Was totally looking forward to that. Every flavor of poptart and if you want nothing sweet or sugary, then you can even just grab toast with any spread.Everyone's friendly. Totally fun vibe. Lots of old shows playing on the ancient tubes downstairs. When we were there, it was Clarissa Explains It All. Decorated with all the 80s and 90s paraphernalia. Prices are totally right.Love this place. Will be back!",

And admittedly, cereal was my main breakfast of choice as a kid 90% of the time. So I felt like I was back in my childhood just being in the cafe. At the bottom level, they even have twin beds where you can enjoy your cereal, along with other cool retro artifacts. The possibilities of your cereal creation is endless! I decided to go with The Lion King since I'm a fan of the caramel/chocolate mix and it was delicious!!! The caramel milk used can be customized to your liking as well so I went with soy.

Who doesn't love eating cereal for dinner?? Don't tell me you've never gotten in from work, put your PJs straight on, and served yourself the biggest bowl of cereal known to man for dinner because you can't be bothered to cook. And now you can enjoy cereal for dinner in a less antisocial kinda way! This place throws you back to the 90s, music and all. The guys that work there are super friendly and easy going. If you love cereal as much as I do then you need to get down there asap. Their list of cereals is extensive. Crazy extensive (and includes a few gluten free choices -yippee!). Then you've got toppings like strawberries, marshmallows, banana, chocolate drops and walnuts. Then you have all the milk (dairy and non-dairy) with the option to flavour your milk with chocolate, strawberry, vanilla and so on. Oh and I forgot to mention, \u00a0you can mix your cereals!! (We were rarely allowed to do that as kids...it was a treat!) Can you feel my excitement??? I love everything about it!In the end I went for a large bowl of Ricicles with marshmallows and strawberries, topped with strawberry rice milk (I actually got overwhelmed with the toppings and milk choices and forgot that I could mix cereals...nooooo)! No doubt about it, 5 stars. And to the haters? Get a life! (FYI the best way to do this is to start having breakfast for dinner - go on, have some fun).",

There was a full five minutes where no one was at the counter. Divide and conquer blokes.-Invest the 20 minutes it would take to provide an up to date inventory each morning. Post that on social media, and in story. Every order in front of me included three strikes of items not being available and/or staff members spending valuable minutes to see whether they had something.-Spend half an hour reading up on the psychology of choice to drive your menu. Few choices provided with the above, accurate inventory will go a long way in making choices easier and customers satisfied.Premise is great, prices more than fair, but business model, or at least management at this location, will be detrimental.",

Not only is it an ultimate hipster heaven with a fun concept, it's also a time capsule to all kinds of good childhood nostalgia. And let's face it the walls of cereal boxes in all the colours of the rainbow just make you smile :) How it works is you start by choosing your cereal from dozens of choices ranging from classics like Captain Crunch, Apple Jacks, Coco Pops etc. to the more peculiar ones like Poppin' Pebbles in either a small, medium or large bowl. Then you choose your milk (there's like 20 different ones to choose from) and finally you choose your toppings. This will set you back about 4 pounds or so. Some people complain it's too expensive, but I say it's totally worth the experience!I ordered Lucky Charms with extra marshmallows and it was everything I wished it would be and more. So sugary and unhealthy and awesome! It was just a fun thing to do and I enjoyed it!On top of everything the staff is great or in the famous words of Tony the Tiger \"they're g-r-r-r-e-a-t\"!",

And it's so much fun to do pick the different cereals and toppings you like.Tough decision but I picked the \"double rainbow\" one and was not disappointed. I felt like a kid again and smiled over every spoon with a blue froot loop on it- the only colour we don't have in the German froot loops.They have some cute little souvenirs (also pretty expensive) but I couldn't leave without taking a bottle of 'freeze dried cereal marshmallows' with me :-)",

Especially when I'm not usually a fan of cereal...Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. I came here on a Sunday morning at around 10 am and it seemed like we had just beat the crowd, since the line started getting long after we came. I wanted something light since I would be getting afternoon tea later that day, so I ended up going for a small bowl of Cheerios with almond milk and blueberries. They prepared my bowl right away, and I appreciated how they put the milk in a separate jar - I like pouring in my milk in smaller portions because I'm a slow eater and if I don't, the cereal gets soggy.What I ordered sounds simple enough, but it was surprisingly satisfying. I can't say it was anything special, but it was definitely a solid breakfast. I only wish they put more blueberries, especially since it's an extra cost - I expect to get more than 10 (if I even got that many...). Otherwise, I enjoyed my experience here (both the concept and vibe were awesome) and I recommend a visit here if you're in the area!",

It was really hot and smelled kind of like milk (not in a good way though). I did love the way the place is decorated. It kind of makes it perfect for a photo-op, which is why I guess every single customer that enters is so wide-eyed and snapping photos like a crazy person. I felt a little bad for the people that worked there because they are probably in a million photos but I guess they are used to it? I did snap one or 2 pics, but I was discreet about it, ok?!Anyways, I got some cereal. It was nothing special really since you can get a whole box for like $2 in America. I'm not sure if it's available in the UK? I didn't know that people actually wanted to eat Poptarts and cereal like that. I thought it was just part of my parents doing a bad job. I didn't know that people actually added other toppings to cereal like chocolate pieces and such. That is just odd. They really do have a good variety of cereals - even some rare ones.It is interesting that they had different types of milk (almond, hazelnut, etc) but they are from the box so don't expect freshly squeezed ones. I was disappointed about the banana milk flavor because it was actually like just 5 slices of an actual banana that they cut up and put into the cereal. At least blend it into the milk or something.I think it's more about the experience and the novelty. It did bring back some nostalgia.",

As if breakfast for dinner wasn't good enough on its own, this place makes it even better!Dozens of kinds of cereal from the UK, USA, and all around the world combine with 30 kinds of milk for nearly endless combinations of cereal nirvana! If you're feeling adventurous, you can even mix and match cereals into a single bowl. Their professionally-trained cereal engineers have come up with a handful of cereal 'cocktails' with wild combinations of cereal, flavored milk, and sweet toppings.The ensuing rush of sugar and nostalgia are helped along by the retro music and cereal art all over the walls. There's a series of collector's edition cereals (think movie merchandise like Star Wars Cheerios) and some awesome mosaic portraits of famous serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Dexter made entirely out of cereal pieces. Prices were really reasonable, the staff was friendly and helpful (and clearly loved their job), and the ambiance was comfortable. I can't wait to go back again. With so many cereal combinations to try, that's gonna be soon so I can keep experimenting with the perfect blend. Next time I might come in pajamas too (just to complete the childhood breakfast experience)!",

I had the Peanut Butter Jelly Time, so good with the strawberry milk! I forgo my lactose intolerance for a day to have this and it was so worth it. Seriously! The vibe inside is awesome and the staff is friendly and willing to help if you want to switch anything up in their pre-made \"cocktails.\" Lots of vintage and retro memorabilia.

    "text": "My partner and I went out seeking a simple yet delightful breakfast on a gloomy Saturday morning.Came across the notorious cereal killer cafe and while expectations were high due to its fame, the reality was beyond disappointing. Firstly, took us about 15 minutes once sitting down to be attended. Once we were, had to wait another 10 for someone to take our order. Once ordered, we expected to wait a bit for two simple bowls of cereal with some milk (and a side of strawberries). Our expectations were surpassed by the painful 45 minute wait, for (again), 2 bowls of cereal (no drinks). Once the food arrived, my side of strawberries consisted of a single strawberry cleverly sliced into 5 bits. Additionally, the strawberries were drowned in a surprise portion of canned whipped cream (which to clarify, was never ordered). \u00a0Once we finished the food, we were eager to leave. Getting to the register, we noticed a mayhem of paper receipts scattered along the table. This was so difficult to sort out, that a line formed, as customers were asked to repeat their orders so they could pay. Overall, felt hard to justify a 45-minute wait for two bowls of cereal- and no, it was not too full (no lines or anything).They seemed to be training a few staff members on the occasion- I can definitely understand that may have been the cause of some confusion, and do not blame them or any particular staff members. Simply ask for more attention to be given to orders, as all other tables around us also seemed miffed at the waiting times.",

That may be part of its lure and charm. They do \u00a0have an extensive selection of cereals. Their mixed recipes are interesting and milkshakes are gorgeous. They look like they were created by Hanna-Barbera. The bottom line: this is a great tourist stop but not likely a regular stop for locals.",

I really wanted to love this place but to have a breakfast over an hour for cereal is beyond ridiculous.

We had looked at the menu online beforehand to get ourselves excited, but I have a rule about not choosing what to eat before you get to somewhere so I decided to wait and see the menu when I arrived. The only issue is there wasn't much of a menu at the actual cafe; they had a blackboard up with lots of combos but unless you knew what you were doing, it was very hard to know all the options. I made a rash decision to go for a ready made combo of the mint chocolate dish with a happy hippo on top just because I could (!) and my boyfriend chose a Lion inspired one. We got a Pop Tart on the side (obviously) and some sugar sweet berry Fanta. By the time we ate it was actually 12 midday, but this is probably a good thing considering the huge intake of sugar that we consumed in such a short period of time!The cafe isn't very big with limited seating so I imagine it gets lretty busy. Luckily we got a seat downstairs, surrounded by all the quirky cereal memorabilia which gives the place such a nice touch. It's very expensive breakfast, but definitely worth it for the experience. My main recommendation is to choose from the online menu beforehand.",

Someone must've spent a lifetime collecting all the 80s and 90s memorabilia on the walls - anyone else remember the plastic tiger-shaped bike reflectors from the Frosties packets?! And they even had Clarissa Explains It All showing on TV! And then there's the cereal. The menu reads like a dentist's worst nightmare, each item sweeter than the last. And SO much choice it's overwhelming: 100+ cereals, 20+ toppings, poptarts, toast and just when you think you've cracked it, even 20 types of milk. My inner monologue was in overdrive (do I want something chocolatey? woah is that Cinnabon cereal?! maybe I should get a fruity poptart to be healthy? pah who am I kidding, 'healthy'! hmm is chocolate milk too much?! etc etc).Luckily there's a queue for you to make up your mind, and probably change it ten times with each new cereal box you spot. It moves fairly speedily but took a good half hour for us on a Sunday at 11ish, and was longer when we left. The most amusing part was hearing snatches of everyone else's convo's as they passed the ever expanding queue through Brick Lane Market ('you mean these people are all waiting for CEREAL?!', 'what do you mean it ONLY sells cereal?', '\u00a33.50 a BOWL?! Why don't they go round the corner to Tesco?').Yes, it's kinda ridiculous. And it's unnecessary, and unhealthy, and completely overhyped. But it's just so fun that I don't care. I had a medium bowl of Reese's Puffs, topped with crumbled Oreo cookies (at the server's suggestion) and semi-skimmed milk, with a blueberry poptart (that I defo didn't need) and a latte. I left feeling like I needed to brush my teeth and praying the sugar crash later wasn't too bad and probably with early onset diabetes - but damned if it didn't put the biggest smile on my face too :-D",

This shop really hit the need for a fun breakfast! You have a few options for your cereal. You can either build your own (pick which cereal you want along with size and type of milk), and then add toppings for I think 40p per topping. The other option would be to pick one of their original mixes. They hsve a lot of options to pick from. You can sit upstairs if there is room, or go downstairs for more seating. I would suggest going elsewhere for coffee. They have a few old school tvs and posters there as well. \u00a0Loved it, thanks!",

Straight out I have to admit that the concept behind this place is awesome - a cafe devoted entirely to breakfast cereal. It certainly is a very hip concept, and I don't think I know of any place where you can actually order breakfast cereal for breakfast (though they do serve breakfast all day). While you can have a single serving of cereals, they also offer cocktails, namely a mix of different cereals, and of course they have coffee as well (though the coffee was okay, nothing hugely spectacular). However, I have to admit that there are a couple of areas where they fall down, and it isn't just the coffee. First of all they don't have a huge selection of juice. In fact I can't remember if they had any juice. Secondly, other than gluten free cornflakes, pretty much all of their cereals are the fancy, high in suger, types - this isn't a place you go for a healthy meal. While I loved the concept, I was quite disappointed that my brother, who was looking forward to a cocktail of cornflakes, rice bubbles, all bran, and wheat germ, ended up only having some gluten free cornflakes.",

They have a whole wall of cereals for you to mix and match as well as a menu that has combinations for you to choose from with different flavored milks.

    "text": "DON'T GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY! (read on for why) I went to Cereal Killer today around 3 PM with a large group (of seven). We didn't get to sit together but they found a smaller table for us in the back (fyi you can prob have six or seven on a longer table+bed in the back if you request/wait). Was surprised when my friends who had come in a group (of six) almost AN HOUR before me still hadn't ordered... After hearing about their 40 minute wait just to order, we quickly flagged down the waitress. It got quite crowded and we ended up waiting over an hour for 2 bowls of cereal and a maltshake. The staff also kept messing up everyone's orders (there were one new employee but still) so there were lots of negative/angry customer vibes. The worst part (even more so than wasting time waiting on an overpriced bowl of cereal) was when one of my friends in the other group had a severe nut allergy and they served her cereal bowl with NUTELLA. My friend had asked and clarified multiple times (like 7) if her cereal had nuts in it. Her server didn't even know exactly what was in the cereals (They have NO INGREDIENTS LIST on their menus).I understand that the cafe was busy when we got there and they tried to do their best to help her after the fact, but I was very disappointed and will not be recommending this location to anyone.In summary,- bad service/wait time to order and to get cereal (how long does this really take like cmon)!!- very crowded and cramped especially in the back - inattentive staff who were not careful enough regarding my friend's NUT ALLERGY (she could have almost died...)- cereal is very subpar, friend's maltshake had foam/no icecream or even milk",

The service here was the absolute WORST. It took an hour to get served, which if I had ordered filet mignon I'd be ok with. But no, I ordered a bowl of cereal. And not even a bowl of cereal and milk because the milk was served on the SIDE! HOW DOES IT TAKE THAT LONG TO PUT CEREAL IN A BOWL?! I wasn't alone in this, the people around me were experiencing the same slow service I was, we were all equally confused as to what could be going on in. Then I had to go to the bathroom (as one does from time to time) and was met with a roll of soggy toilet paper and water all over the floor. It was nauseating. While trying to pay and leave to finally let one of the parties waiting (way too long) in line a table, our waitress was MIA. We had to flag her down ourselves and hand her the money. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars not 1 is because the cereal was tasty, but it was not worth it for the price or for the amount of time that was shed off my life clock waiting for these people to put cereal in a bowl in any kind of timely manner. NOT WORTH IT!! Just go to Sainsbury's. Less time, less money, dry toilet paper.",

    "text": "Updating because I came back today after my first visit over 2 years ago and was disappointed in what a different experience I had. Expecting the same joyful, nostalgic, and somewhat self-aware hipster irony of spending 10 pounds on cereal, I arrived at cereal killer after a walk through the Columbia flower market. The staff were friendly and we were seated quickly and given the choice to pick one of the tables in the (pretty dimly lit) back room. We chose the table with the most light, underneath a wall of vintage cereal boxes. We were enjoying looking at all of the unique cereals until another waitress came and asked us to move because they actually needed to give the table to a larger party. Not a huge deal, and understandable, so we moved to the other table. Our waitress was very helpful in explaining some menu items (the menu has been updated since the last time I went). When our food came, the person who brought it put down our spoons- straight onto the bare table. I realize I'm extremely picky about this kind of thing but I really don't like silverware being put straight onto the surface of the table (which had crumbs from the previous guests still on it) as you never know what someone put on there last! After a few minutes when the waitress passed by, I asked her politely for another spoon. She stared at the spoons we already had and said \"sure\", never to return with a new one. Only when my friend went to the front counter to ask for spoons did we receive them! Though we had asked for some water which never came, the food itself was delicious as is expected of your favorite childhood cereals! Most of my disappointment came from the atmosphere/experience. They are trying to make it a sit down restaurant and have added savory options, which takes away from the fun simplicity of the idea in my opinion. What used to be such a fun, cute place now felt tired and old, with the cereal art pieces missing large chunks of Cheerios and a beanie baby wall that looked like about a third of them had fallen off.An example of the clientele/mood in the dining room- two girls were sitting at one of the tables taking photos. They had moved from their original table to this one because it had a bed with children's sheets as a bench. When the waitress came to ask them to please move so she could sit a party at that table, they said \"one minute\" and left the entire party standing there while they posed with cereal in multiple different configurations. Obviously to some extent everyone that goes to a place like this is going for the novelty or to take photos of their cereal creations to show friends how ~trendy~ they are and I am not one to talk on that front! But, i was disappointed in the lackluster experience after having such a great one on my first visit.EDIT: Also, no wifi:( and subpar restroom....",

With whole milk and a double espresso, I was in breakfast heaven! We ate downstairs, while sitting on kids beds watching old cartoons like Ninja Turtles and Thundercats on ancient TV's complete with built in VCR's!This was a strange time warp back to somebody's childhood. I'm sure that was the intent anyway! While enjoying our delicious breakfast, I noticed they had cereal boxes from all sorts of sources, including two with royals on them!

The vibe of the place was pretty cool but I think the spot is overrated. The employees were very nice but the service was extremely slow and what i thought was going to be an in-and-out turned into a 30 minute wait for a bowl of cereal. I'd say this place is perfect for tourists who have some time to kill, but if you're in a hurry, maybe just come for the pictures. Overall, the restaurant is really cool and definitely Instagram worthy but the cereal wasn't as interesting as I expected it to be. Make sure you have other meals lined up for your day if you choose to eat here!",

    "text": "My friend was showing our mutual friend and I around as it was our first visit to London. She wanted to introduce us to the infamous salt beef at the two beigel stores on brick lane. It was late at night and I, for some reason, decided to just look to my left and there it was, like a calling from the heavens, a restaurant with every cereal box you can ever imagine. \"Oh my, I forgot to tell you. This place is known for their cereal and sweet treats,\" my friend exclaimed.My jaw dropped when I made eye contact with it. I haven't had a bowl of cereal in ages, let alone this specific one. There it was...OREO O'S. Yes. For everyone who doesn't live in South Korea, the only country that still makes them, this is something we haven't seen in about a decade. I wanted to just jump through the window and hold the box because I thought I was hallucinating. They were closing up and I asked if they sold cereal by the box. Unfortunately they don't, especially because the O's are a rarity and very hard to obtain.We were engulfing on the rest of our Eurotrip the next morning and returned to London for the last day. I made it a goal of mine to indulge in a bowl before we headed back to the states.Fast forward 5 days later to the morning of our flight...We were short on time, but my friend and I were on a mission to buy salt beef and Oreo O's respectively. We made it to brick lane with minutes to spare. The line at Cereal Killer was taking forever with only about 5 people in front. Can't blame them because there are so many combinations of cereal, milk, toppings, milkshakes, poptarts, and other sweet delicacies. I, however, knew what I wanted. Simply a large bowl with Oreo O's and regular milk. I wanted to feel like a kid again! My turn was up and I placed my order. The guy at the register was ridiculously kind and told me that they may be opening up shop in my home, NYC! BEST NEWS EVER!!!!! Hopefully it happens.My bowl and milk arrived and I was really childish about it - jumping in my seat and all. 10 years later and I'm finally reunited with an former lover. What made it even more meaningful was that I recieved the second to last serving of O's! It was meant to be! What a romantic story, eh?! They put crumbled oreos in the bowl as well. I'm not complaining! But the first bite was so satisfying. I had to rush through the bowl because we were really short on time. I was happy to say the least. The large bowl of just Oreo O's was 6.95 pounds, I believe. High price because it is rare. Overall the other prices aren't TOO expensive, but for cereal it is. You do get your money's worth and it revives the kid in you. The bowls are small, medium, and large. I am definitely going here a few times during my next trip to London and I highly recommend it to anyone in town. This is a MUST VISIT!Also.. shoutout to the ninja team in Brick Lane! You guys are awesome! Thank you for the service!",

I had the frosted flakes and hot chocolate with brownies! The top floor is really cool with all types of cereal hanging on the wall. But the downstairs is even cooler taking it back to the 90's. This place had old Vcr's, animations/music from the 90's & even a throwback posters of Nsync! This place needs 5 STARS because it's iterally the coolest place in Shoreditch!",

The staff is amazing - not many places will seat a group of 25 american's 15 minutes before closing time - the atmosphere is one of a kind, and I think it's almost impossible to not enjoy every second of time spent here. I will definitely be back, Cereal Killer Cafe!!",
