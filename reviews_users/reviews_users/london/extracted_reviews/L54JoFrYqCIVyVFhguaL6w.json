It's a huge letdown and I've lost count of the number of times I've gone there only to leave for somewhere else after the wait for service proved too frustrating.",

I know this is traditional for ladies but I've never been here and not had to queue, even midday) and the queues at the bar. It's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes to get served here so plan your drinks far in advance and if possible, get jugs of whatever you're drinking!",

Coming back a few weeks ago in pretty much the opposite set of conditions (it had been dark for hourstemperatures falling) and on a weekday evening, I found quite an empty pub with comfortable chairs and a couple of real Ales, including the wonderful Adnams Kolsch that has been doing the rounds of late. So in conclusion this is a good pub whenever and whatever the weather.although I gather from other reviews it might be a bit of a pain at peak drinking times.",

    "text": "I don't even know why we bother going into this place. Ordinarily I'd use my stock answer, \"spite\", but a trip to the Edinboro Castle is totally an exercise in self-humiliation. As many other posters have indicated, it should be a very reasonable boozer. It's quite a roomy, airy building and the beer garden's widely known for being one of the nicer ones around. The range of beers looks promising, and when we were there a promotional poster announced that bottles of wine were sold at crazy discount knockdown prices if it happened to be raining outside. The more cynical reader might speculate that instead they're just jacking wine prices up ridonculously when it's sunny, but hey. We've been attempting to enjoy this pub for several years now, and the problem is always the same - getting service is impossible. I was in on a Monday night, and there was virtually nobody around: just myself, another guy further around, and a girl in the process of being served. Quite what the barman was doing is anyone's guess, although it was definitely full of sound & fury. 4 or 5 other bar staff flitted past behind the bar, ignoring we impotent would-be drink purchasers. Maybe they wouldn't serve us because they were too young? Who knows. It seems a silly thing to go on, and on, and on about, however the base function of a pub is to be able to get some drinks & then go and relax in whatever atmosphere the venue provides with your friends, and all I can say is i you're planning a trip to the Edinboro Castle then make sure that whoever's going to do a bar run has plenty of free minutes on their mobile plan, because that's the only way you're going to get to chat to them. This pub has been a local to me in a home and a work sense in the past, and despite several inexplicable bits of renovation and a number of passing years, the synopsis has to be: FAIL. Unless you want an airy room to sit with your friends and not drink. It's an absolute boon in those stakes. Special mention goes to the kitchen, by the way, for taking so long to figure out that we'd ordered & paid for food, and to work out how this offering might be prepared, cooked & served, that when we went up to enquire 40 minutes later they bluntly asserted that the kitchen was shut. Bravo. Presumably all the kitchen staff were flat out doing something behind the bar.",

Very good beer selection, reasonably priced, though you're likely to end up with a fair amount of head on your pint so ask them to top it up if they try and fob you off with an inch of the stuff. Decent food, not overpriced either. Looking forward to visiting again in the summer when they're finished renovating and have opened up the garden properly - apparently they cook a very good BBQ when it's warmer too.",

Self-consciously aware of their own need to be different. So, so different. Resulting in being much the same as so many other places across town. You see? Wnkey is just a bit more concise. As far as Camden is concerned, this place is different, in a same-same-but-different way. Bless. It's quirky, cavernous, and quite interesting in character. And it has an enormous and quite lovely garden in which to drink beer. Ah. First catch your beer. Your first challenge is to get to the bar. This can be tricky. The bar is almost invariably rammed. Even if the rest of the pub is empty, people are queuing three, four deep at the bar. The reason for this soon becomes apparent. If there are more sullen, detached, idle and incompetent bar staff in London I would like to know about it. Know about it so I can go and shake their disaffected, grouchy hand. The service is just appalling, to the point that any redeeming features of this place have a dark, dark shadow cast over them. Your chances of getting served seem to depend largely on pot luck. Or how cool you look. This could be nonsense, but I don't own a pair of converse trainers and tend to blame most of my misfortune in life on this and this alone. The sensible answer could be to buy some converse trainers, but who wins then, huh? When you eventually do get graced with service, or the closest they can come to it, you are likely to be disappointed. I gave up drinking beer here. IF there is any bitter on it is invariably sour. Much the same goes for the Guinness. The wine list fails to impress and everything is overpriced. This is obviously well known and you will usually see several people in the beer garden being oh so subtle as they pour cans of Strongbow into their glasses. I genuinely believe that this could be a nice place, if it wasn't screaming NO, NO! You don't understand me! I'm a tortured genius! quite so loudly, and if the staff were a little more well at all switched on. Great potential, thoroughly let down by shoddy staff and a painful self-awareness. But in the summer, the beer garden really does draw 'em in and probably me too like a metaphorical fly to an allagorical turd",

    "text": "This really should be a great pub. Nice contemporary decor, decent space and seating, huge beer patio (you can't call it a 'garden' if it has no grass), great selection of beers, promising-looking food, reasonable location. So what's not to like? Well, I'm going to say what pretty much everyone else says about this place unless you're going to smuggle your own drink in, then you will spend the evening (or day) very thirsty, or frustrated, or both. Sure, it gets busy, especially in the summer. But that is not the reason why it is so hard to get a drink. The reason is much more fundamental - the staff are consistently appalling. Without exception. I have had the misfortune to have to visit this pub regularly over several years (not through choice, I hasten to add), and I have had lots of opportunity to observe this problem in detail (whilst waiting for 45 minutes to get served). Here is the thing. You get anywhere between 7 and 10 people behind the bar, all looking busy. But I challenge you to watch any one of them, to see what they are actually doing. In most cases, they will be actively walking up and down the bar just 'looking busy' (moving glasses from one end of the bar and back, popping out the back, opening and shutting fridge doors, etc.). Very little time is actually spent serving drinks to customers, despite the appearance of busyness. It's impressive, in a way. And bearing in mind I have seen many different people working behind the bar over the years, all exhibiting this behaviour, you've got to wonder if they receive special training. On the plus side, if you can ever get a drink, it's a cool place to have a drink in the summer!",

So maximum points for that - however, ever since it had a refurb a few years ago it's become a wee bit rubbish at service and quite a lot overcome with self-importance (although I'm not sure pubs themselves can have attitude?) It's always going to do well in summer with its massive garden and being not too far away from Regents Park, it gets a load of post softballers etc. But that does mean it's utterly rammed at times and impossible to get a beer this side of Autumn. The long queues in summer can also mean people decide to leave their sense of humour at home and all too often it can get wella bit 'arsey' at the bar. So maybe a better place to visit on a Sunday afternoon or early in the week or er in winter. Food is quite tasty when they aren't too busy, but usually a bit average when they are busy - so again worth bearing in mind. It's also a bit pricey for what it is.",

The staff can be tempramental (e.g. can be overly rude when asking people to leave!) and the food is hit and miss - the outdoor summer BBQ was especially disappointing in terms of price and quality. But definitely somewhere you can happily spend hours drinking, chatting and people watching. **I've just taken off a star cos the pub was so busy this weekend that people just had to leave when the queue to get a drink took AN HOUR and, after the kitchen shutting abruptly for an unknown reason, and then opening later on, the food was appalling - stone cold chips and a few bits and pieces that looked like they had been hanging around all day and someone had scraped together to serve on one plate.

Not sure what it would be like when raining, however).The 6 of us arrived at around 3pm and had our pick of tables - unusually easy - so we chose to sat inside. The pub is really nice, lovely decor and didn't seem too busy or stressful.When I went to the bar to get drinks, I was told that there would be an hour wait for food, so we decided to order early. We all ordered roasts.Two roasts came within ten minutes, but the other two didn't arrive within an hour and a half. We complained and the staff were very apologetic, offering us three complimentary desserts to share between us. In a way, we probably would have preferred if either the whole table had been late or (obviously) all meals had been on time, but this was a good way to resolve it.The food was good, but when we asked for extra biscuits to go with the cheese and biscuits we were sharing between two (they only supplied 5 oatcakes), we were told we would have to pay for them.So in summary, I would say that the service is disorganised, but the food is good when you receive it.",

The only drawback is on a Sunday it can get quite crowded. And there are a lot of smokers out on the patio. Also they had some kind of special barbecue going on Sunday. Be warned it is self-service which actually makes things go a little faster if you're pushy. By the way the desserts are not to be missed especially the toffee pudding. Also if you have kids it's only two blocks from Regent Park and a terrific playground.",

They have a massive garden that is the perfect spot for drinks after work (or at lunch for a cheeky one on a nice day). Seems pretty easy to get a table on most days, plus if you have a group, you can reserve a table or two in advance, which is nice.They have a great selection of beers, ranging from Camden Hells, Sierra Nevada, Punk Dog 5am and several cask pulled ales as well. I've always enjoyed myself here. Haven't eaten here, but everything that I've seen brought out looked good. When you are on a mission to drink, food just gets in the way! The Castle delivers!",

Those of our party that ate pronounced the fish finger sandwiches to be very good (& the chef did at least make them after they had officially stopped serving grub) but despite that & the fact they had 4 ciders on draught as well as guest ales the overall experience was nothing special.

    "text": "This is a lovely little pub to visit both during the day and in the evening. The venue itself is beautiful and the food is great. Especially when the weather gets better you must take advantage of the beer garden and enjoy your meal out in the sun. I would particularly recommend the pork and chorizo burger and you can complete your meal with a glass of Pimms. At night they have some beautiful lights in the garden and it can be a great starting place to your Camden night out. That's what spring is for after all.",

    "text": "OK. Maybe I just don't get the thing with the name. Is it meant to be a playing-with-pronunciation angle? Are they not allowed to use the word \"Edinburgh\" in its proper form? Maybe things that aren't *actually* Edinburgh Castle just... aren't allowed to be called Edinburgh Castle? Maybe the name has absolutely nothing to do with Edinburgh. Hmmm. Perhaps I'm just a pedantic individual from Edinburgh that's totally missing the point. Probably quite likely.Good things to highlight about the 'Castle. It's got a nice big area for outdoor beverage swigging in the sunshine, so, during the warmer months, it's a bit of a go-to place in Camden for big groups needing extra beer garden space. It's also fairly roomy inside the actual bar for sports viewing - I watched a rugby game here and the atmosphere was pretty buzzing. So was I after a couple of potent beer \"samplings\"... Because it's a popular bar, it's sometimes a bit of a wait to get served. That's what comes with popularity with any bar really, but when you're dying for a Bloody Mary to solve the effects of last night's over-enthusiasm with the vino bottle, then it can seem like a long time to wait. It was an amazing Bloody Mary though.",

They do bookings and have loads of room outside, the only downside is that their popularity leads to long waits at the bar, but you can't hold that against them and the bar staff are really lovely when you finally get to them, and helpful as the guy next to me found when he made an odd request. Will definitely be returning!",

Really close to Regents Park and only a short walk from Camden Town tube - but yet not on the tourist trail...At the weekend the BBQ cranks out burgers and when the weather turns cooler there are covered areas, heaters or grab a sofa inside.We had some beers and snacks (chips and salt & pepper squid) whilst staving off hangovers and enjoying the last of the summer sun :)",

The bar can be a bit of a mission you have to send one person in and one on the look out for a seat! Usually parties book up the tables near the bar. There are some nice and cozy seating areas around the edge of the beer garden perfect for 5-8 people. Then bench after bench in the garden area with a few small tables at the back.Get here early on the weekend to grab a seat or be prepared to stand! Good selection of drinks and fantastic atmosphere! A little out the way from the tube station but worth the visit!",

The enclosed beer garden means its a bit of a sun trap and there's sooo many outside seats it creates a lovely buzz.They have an outside bar where you can order burgers and beers, and roast dinners are ordered inside.

They also fire up a BBQ in the beer garden area during the summer which is a nice addition to the traditional pub grub they regularly serve.They also have Sierra Nevada on tap which is a plus for an ex-pat like me and makes a surprisingly good shandy - Yea, an IPA shandy sounds weird but it's darn good!",

It's large without being overwhelming, and designed in a way that makes you feel like you're in your own little slice of private garden. Well done, there. It gets rammed with people on any nice day, as you would expect. The food looks nice, but I haven't ever had it. Pints are expensive here, sadly. After a few rounds, we'll often relocate or (the horror!) slow our drinking. I'm very thankful it's there, though, so I don't have to drink cans by the canal with the youths! They definitely don't want my company.",

    "text": "One of the better Mitchell & Butler Castle pubs in London in my opinion; especially for those seeking somewhere to top up their tan and drink premium quality beers and ciders. The bar staff are friendly and knowledgeable about what they're selling, the decor is as \u00a0you would expect from the chain, cool and just different enough from that last one that you wouldn't know it was a chain unless you clocked the food menu, the food menu which delivers probably the best pub food you'll find in the UK - be it burgers, fish and chips, sausage and mash, all the regular pub food choices are there alongside healthy and exotic sounding sandwiches and salads. Finally the drink selection, as a cider drinker when I was in the other day I was super happy to see that they had Thatchers Old Rascal and have been pressuring my local (and northern) Castle pub to follow suit ever since without much luck. If you like your cider and it's there on tap, give it a try. But the real draw is of course the beer garden, which whilst not being the largest I've ever stepped foot in, is a beautiful outside space that delivers up exactly what you need from it. Top class little pub and well worth the visit.",
