It's really hard to find a restaurant in which you can really enjoy the food, find decent food for the children (which is more than a burger and chips), fast service and friendly atmosphere. This place has it all. The pizza and pasta were superior, the wine was great, the waiters were extremely friendly and efficient and altogether we had a wonderful experience. Something about this place just works and you can feel it in the air. And at the end of the meal, we paid 60 pounds per family (including wine and dessert), a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "These guys completely exceeded my expectations. In South Ken needing a quick pizza fix, they made me a pizza in the 8 minute timeframe promised. And surprisingly delicious it was too: fresh tomato passata (as opposed to a pre-prepared sauce stuffed with unwelcome sweeteners and herbs), strips of anchovies and slices of mozzarella sparingly spread on a perfectly cooked (just between soggy and crispbread) base. I'm a huge pizza fan and buy it quite regularly, but was still very pleasantly surprised by the pizza here. The pizzas are quite small, but I think this is more than compensated for by the low price (starting at \u00a35.40 for a margherita) and the unusually high quality. I'll be back.",

    "text": "Well, a relatively new restaurant in South Kensington. What a treat . . . I went along with my wife and two good friends (whose taste in food is impeccable) who had recommended this place to my wife and I on several occasions. And, it must be said, whose taste in food, pubs and restaurants I have yet to fault. We had all been out together for a social drink (not a session) and had decided to go out to eat and that we'd try Rocca - especially as my friends had pressed us. Where to start: the wine list inexpensive and unimpressive, acceptable and uninspired. As a rating: a solid \"Yawn\". Ah \"the food?\" I hear you cry - well . . . I'll not be going there again in any hurry and I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone, and, given the contents of the \"vongole\" I won't be recommending it to the dog either! My friend had a Pizza which was, in his words, quite acceptable. My friend's wife has a pasta dish (spaghetti) with a vongole sauce. It went back as being slightly underdone and it had grit in it. Gee guys - you're supposed to wash the clams - the grit is not seasoning or flavouring. Damn lucky she didn't break a tooth. I had a Carbonara and the pasta was - quite simply - very undercooked. Now I've lived in restaurants all my life, my grandfather had them, my father had them and I've run them. I can put a carbonara together in my sleep - which is why I always order it in a new Italian as my \"benchmark\" dish. Well - too much cream, no egg yolk, and the pasta half raw. Called over the waiter who took it away with a loud grumble (that and the Vongole) and then returned, - and from the other side of the restaurant - proceeded to instruct me in the nuances of \"al dente\" pasta - idiot. I've forgotten more about a professional kitchen than he will ever know. But one thing's for sure - Rocca does NOT think that the customer is always right. Carbonara not good - far from it. Tiramisu to follow - probably bought-in and if it wasn't then it was a truly dire homemade attempt. My wife had Bolognese which was - I am happy to say this (because I tried it - so disbelieving was I ). It is/was EXCELLENT. Not as good as my Mother's (nor is my own) but it was CLOSE, yeah - probably as good as mine - or damn near it. Oh yes, and the prtion size IS goodHowever I will avoid the place from now on and I suggest you do too. Spend you money well in Spagos (literally around the corner) where - if you do send your food back (I never have in 30 years) - they will apologise and sort it out and not include it on the bill (as Rocca did). They're getting two stars because the Bolognese was BRILLIANT. But for that Bolognese they'd get one star, and that grudgingly. Me? Not know what 'al dente' is? My god . . . to even suggest the customer doesn't know what he's talking about. Hey, if they don't improve they won't be there next year . . .",

    "text": "During our visit here, we had the absolute WORST experience ever. Starting with our rude waitress to just okay Italian food. To start with the ending of story, I spent most of the late night and earlier AM sick from the lasagna I ate from here.When we arrived to Rocca for dinner, I approached the waitress outside about obtaining a table for two. She told me that she will look inside to see if any tables opened up; however, she quickly disregarded looking for any available tables and I watched her just stand at the front of the restaurant doing nothing. It was about 5 minutes later that a nicer gentlemen came out to help us with a table. After he looked throughout the restaurant and noted no available tables for two, we waited about 10 minutes for a table.Once seated we waited over 15 minutes until the waitress first came to us. This would not have normally bothered me, but I saw the three parties seated after us all place their orders before we were even acknowledged. The only positive thing was we did receive our meals extremely fast. Like mentioned above, I ordered the lasagna and the other person I was with ordered the spaghetti. The spaghetti was very chewy and mushy, definitely not al dente. We also ordered a small salad with the meal, but we never received the salad. After already eating a portion of the meal, the waitress came back to the table. I told her we didn't receive the salad and her response was \"why?\". I was caught off guard to her response because clearly the reason why is that they never brought it out with our entrees. When we told her not to worry about it and just take it off the bill since we had been almost half way through eating, she got in my face arguing with me over it! She was extremely rude the whole time. After asking nicely to take it off and it was no big deal, she never came back once to our table, and we had to ask the nice gentlemen for the check and we just paid with him. As for the food, like I said I got sick (definitely food poisoning) from my lasagna. This was the only thing I ate all day that could have gotten me sick like this! At the table next to us, one of the men sent his pizza back 3 times due to it being undercooked. Finally on the last try, they provided him with a cooked pizza. This was my first time to Rocca and will be my last. I read all these great reviews about the restaurant and was excited to try it. It is a shame, but South Kensington has other great restaurants that I will be dining at from now on.",

    "text": "I think this is the sort of place that South Kensington has been missing: an open and inviting, yet polished-feeling establishment featuring clean design and a straight-forward Italian menu. \u00a0I was walking past a couple weeks after it'd opened, and couldn't help but feel the pull of the warm wood and brick interior and the appealing-sounding offerings of everything from antipasti to pasta.Since I was starting to feel my stomach grumble, I wandered inside for a late lunch. \u00a0I was immediately charmed by the single green apple that accented every table. \u00a0Once I'd ordered, the dish containing the apple was replaced with a little tray of complimentary olives. \u00a0Now, if you've read any of the rest of my reviews, then you know that I'm obsessed with olives... so hurrah! - I was beginning to like this place already!Following the olives and a rather large glass of the house red, I was brought a bowl of tomato soup and a basket of bread (not complimentary - but with the UK catching onto the anti-carbs craze, this is smart of them). \u00a0Honestly, I was disappointed by both. \u00a0The tomato soup had sounded enticing with its addition of \"basil cream\" (hmm.. I'd wondered... what is *that* - unfortunately, I'm still wondering since from what I could tell, it wasn't there... or at least not enough to bother mentioning) and was quite watery - nothing more substantial or special than what you'd get from a can. \u00a0The bread was a mix of some rather boring white rolls, and dry focaccia... *sigh*... when I spring for the bread, especially focaccia, I expect it to be *good.*But the staff was very nice, and very concerned that I had a good visit (understandably)... I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt since I didn't try any of their mains and they had cute apples on the table... not to mention that it was only their first couple of weeks. \u00a0As I said, I'd like to succeed since I feel S. Kens needs an attractive place like this... so I'll go back before I cast a firm verdict.",

By comparison, we walked into Rocca and a table was prepared for us immediately, and we placed our order within minutes. We asked our server if a pizza was big enough to share between 2 people; she said that it was 4 slices, so we ordered two, but in hindsight, one would really have been enough. They are the size of an extremely large dinner plate, and I'm not sure what size slices she was referring to, but it was many more than 4 in my mind. I got the funghi, which had many different types of mushrooms and was exceptionally tasty, and my friend got the ventricina, which also looked good. We also shared the bruschetta al pomodoro and a bottle of the barbera red wine. The food was great and the service also excellent. I would definitely drop by again.",

    "text": "Rocca di Papa was a great choice for an enjoyable, Saturday lunch. Showing up towards the beginning of lunch service meant we had our pick of the liter of seating, and an almost empty front patio. The restaurant is in the perfect location for spotting some of the more exotic cars of London, as within an hour I spotted multiple Ferraris, Aston Martins, and too many Maseratis to keep track of. That being said, the menu is fairly priced, and shouldn't leave a hole in your wallet. To start the meal I sat down with an Americano, which didn't disappoint. Next was the calamari as an appetizer, with my only complaint being that I wish there was more on the plate! Very good, and obviously fresh. This was all brought out quite briskly by the waiters and waitresses, who worked in tangent to bring out parts of the meal. Now onto the meat (or chorizo) of the review. Both myself and my dining partner ordered pizza off the menu. I myself ordered the Iberica, while he ordered the Prosciutto. Sitting on the plate it looked more like a piece of art than a pizza pie, but as voracious as I was it didn't stay that way for long. The sauce was delicious, and complimented the chorizo on the pizza quite well. However, the crust was the best part, being crunchy yet not flakey, and held some serious flavor. The Prosciutto was reported to me to taste quite nice as well, with the crust once again receiving rave reviews. After all was said and done, another Americano was poured and a dish of chocolate gelato was served, while a waiter pushed up the shade of the terrace to let in some more of the suns rays. The rich flavor of the gelato left me more than satisfied as we left to explore more of London's sights and sounds.I highly recommend Rocca to anybody looking for a \u00a320 lunch in the South Kensington area. The pizza was top notch, the coffee was well above average, and \u00a0both were accompanied with an enjoyable atmosphere and friendly waitstaff.",

I particularly loved the grilled prawns starter -- best and unique of such I ever had at an Italian place. The grilled veggies and mozzarella / tomato platter were both great too. The starters themselves were enough to get our appetite going. Then came the mains. I ordered the seafood pasta, which interestingly enough, was served in thick udon noodle type of pasta. The seasoning and seafood were good, but unfortunately, the pasta was a bit dry and sticking together. This is where I would dock .5 star. My other friends' dishes all seemed great. They ordered a pizza, lasagna and crab meat pasta, and they all said they really liked their dishes. We were very pleasantly surprised when we got the bill. For the four of us, the total came down to \u00a370, which is a great value in London. Ambience was very nice as well. Modern and sophisticated, it is good for any type of occasion. Service was good and generally prompt, though it got a little difficult to get attention toward the end of the dinner as the restaurant got more crowded. All in all, thumbs up.",

This is not a child friendly restaurant as there are no high chairs or changing tables in the restrooms and the tables are so close together it is impossible to put your buggy at your table. This left us wrangling two toddlers throughout lunch.The food was very delicious, but the waitress forgot about the wine I had ordered and I had to ask twice for it. Wine was much needed since I was trying to restrain my baby the entire lunch!We ordered pizzas, pasta, bread and some of the most delicious arancini I've ever tasted. I'd give this place a 5/5 for food, but 3/5 due to the incredible difficulty we had bringing our children here.I would go back sans child :)",

Although other reviewers thought the service was a bit haphazard, it was fine for us (and we had a group of 12 to boot) and they were pretty chatty too. \u00a0I think Rocca is pretty decent for the price. \u00a0It's cheaper than Carluccio's (and most other restaurants in a similar range) and the food is not far off in terms of quality (whilst being far above the restaurants below it). \u00a0That said, there are a few other places of better quality with comparable prices (Nuraghe in Tufnell Park springs to mind), although the latter is in Zone 2, not in a prime renting zone. \u00a0 Still, Rocca is a good addition to SK and worth a return trip.",

The bread was warm and mostly very soft (there were a couple of different kinds) and had delicious, grassy (in a good way) olive oil with balsamic vinegar for dipping. The salad was more of a warm tomato sauce, served with slices of toasted bread, a chunk of mozzarella, and olives and basil for garnish. Very good.I ordered the pasta carbonara, and my mom got a seafood pasta dish. Mine was a bit rich (my own fault for ordering carbonara, I think), but otherwise great - the pasta was the perfect texture. I tried the seafood pasta, and it was wonderful, with a not-too-light/not-too-heavy sauce and tons of seafood in it.We got a scoop of strawberry sorbetto to finish, and it was sweet but light and excellent.I was amazed by how good the prices were compared to other places we'd eaten. The atmosphere was nice but not too stuffy or fancy. Definitely worth a visit if you want something a little different and are in the area!",

Rocca came up in the top 10 and was close to our flat in the Chelsea Embankment area. Without a reservation, our party of six ventured into the packed Tuesday night dinner crowd. No idea if we could even get a table. The manager smiled, welcomed us, and told us it would be a ten minute wait, a very pleasant surprise...Yelp reviews payoff. Great service, good food, and very well priced. Would recommend.",

The food was also incredible - definitely one of the top 5 Italian meals I've had in my life. We started with the cucumber tomato salad which came with the perfect vinaigrette and was delicious with beans. We then had the rigatoni pomodoro and margherita which were super flavorful and tasted really fresh despite being dishes that are often boring or overlooked. Finally, we had the lemon cheesecake which was great (and I'm really picky about cheesecake). I would definitely be back!!",

We figured the place must be good when it was packed at 8pm on a Thursday night. We quickly got a table for two. Ordered a bottle of wine. We started with the arrancini (my favorite) and the calamari. Both were excellent. We then split two pasta dishes. I had the seafood and risotto and my husband had the bolognese. Both were fantastic and filling. We finished the meal with the Affogato which was incredible and the chocolate cake. It was such a delicious meal to start our trip. We were intrigued at the prices. It was much cheaper than food here in the states and much better. Will definitely come back the next time we are back in London.",

We fast forward three days later and, looking for a place close to the hotel (already tried a couple of places in the area we returned to Rocca with another guest. \u00a0There were several large parties there but they managed to find a table for us. \u00a0This time we had the arancini, the funghi pizza, the ravioli all'ossobucco, and the buccatini again. \u00a0Nothing was short of fantastic, the pizza had such depth in the mushrooms, the ravioli was so rich and satisfying.One thing we do have to say. . . with such good food we were stuffed by the end of our meals and we never did have the room to try their desserts!Many thanks, Rocca, for your great service (wait staff were VERY cordial on both visits) and tremendous food!",

Our least favorite as the calamari, it was undercooked and the accompany sauce does nothing favorable for the dish. Pizza was delicious, crust was baked nicely and the topping was phenomenal. The tagliolini with crab was the highlight of dinner, the pasta was al dente and the buttery crab sauce that it was in was just mind blowing. The panna cotta was good with raspberry sauce, I just wish they would spend a little bit more time on the presentation of the food.",
