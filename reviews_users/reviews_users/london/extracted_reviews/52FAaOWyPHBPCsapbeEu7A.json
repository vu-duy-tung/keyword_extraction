I loved the flavours and the mixture of textures....this dish is a must try if you come here! I also enjoyed the chicken makhani, the flavours were complex and it was creamy and not spicy, which was perfect for me! The chicken in the dish was also very tender. Presentation of the food is very lovely! Atmosphere was classy and tasteful. Service was very good, the servers were friendly, and between courses they come with the little metal scooper to clean up my mess on the table!",

My nann was gently fried and puffy heaven, not to mention the spices to go with, one green and another red-organge. Nothing was ever too spicy, they had tang and mellow earthy flavours to balance the pallate. My rice was a rich yellow with peas and onion crisps. The paneer is stewed and juicy and evenly salted. I got the shared serving plate for two which I strongly recommend as this place isn't cheap. The mushrooms were out of this world. I started crying they were so tender and delicious. The pineapple is seared on a grill so it is Smokey and zesty. The place is small, like most of London but the decorum is very elegant and the wall dressings are a tad unique with old British Indian film placards. The service was adequately tentantive. I would stop in if I ever wanted the best Indian in London, possibly the world.",

My peshwari naan was incredible, as was my friend's garlic naan. The rice was even delicious. We split a chicken, mint, coriander and coconut curry as a main, with a side of okra that was wonderful. We also split a ginger chicken starter that was great, and they even gave us a dish of crispy spinach on the house that they said was a house specialty. My glass of house white wine was good, too.

Venison tikka were dry, though the minuscule lamb samosas were good.Another 45 minutes later we had received our mains. \u00a0Our assumption, like at Star of India and Noor Jahan, is that while slightly more expensive than the average curry house in London portions would be standard sized. \u00a0What arrived, however, were multiple tiny bowls of curry with equally small portions of rice, the type of portion you'd get for a \u00a36 lunch special and still be disappointed. We asked for poppadoms so many times it got funny - perhaps 5 - and even after the main waiter promised to come and update us on our order (in 2 minutes - I promise, sir), he obviously was still fucking about doing something that prevented him from serving us (and other patrons, I found out). I try to avoid writing negative reviews because I know how hard running a restaurant is in London and obviously, a single poor review from Joshua J can make or break a business, but this place doesn't warrant my apathy. \u00a0Obviously, this place wasn't super expensive but at comparable prices to other overpriced local places, you expect something more than a teacup full of shit food. Wow, free rice, I save all of 1 pound per head and in return I get massively fucked on portion size, a complete disregard for the value of my time, and surely service - thanks Thali for making it easier for me to choose a curry house next time.",

The person that took our order was either the manager or the owner. He quickly suggested a bunch of fancy dishes, but we only were able to settle on a few. He was \"nice\" enough to say- let me fix up a nice meal for you guys! I picked out 4 appetizers and all of us had picked out each individual dishes, some didn't come with neither Nan nor rice, that was strange I thought. After about 25 mins the appetizers were brought out, instead of 4 kinds, we got 6, and 3 orders of each! Now we had 18 appetizers . Wow! They were pretty \"generous\" by giving us enough food but without much explaining! So my appetizers were good, but everything was in super-small portions! Just that portion of the meal was about 80 pounds!!At the end of the meal, the mysterious bill came, but with chicken-scratched writings which none of us could comprehend. And no where on the bill I was able to find the 10% discount they had promised. Overall, the food was just ok, nothing too fancy. I would not recommend this place.",

The wines are reasonably priced, although a small selection.We skipped the appetizers, except for papadams, and went straight for the main course. The table had Lamb Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Makhani, and Tandoori Chicken. The lamb was excellent, spicy but not hot, Tandoori Chicken was nice but a bit dry so the mint sauce was required. Chicken Tikka Makhani was perfect nice and creamy, mild in spice but very flavorful. Sides of Sag Paneer, Lemon Rice, and Pulao Rice. Sag Paneer was different than most I've had, it was pured and not as creamy, but nice chucks of Paneer.I'd recommend the Lamb over the other mains. Definitely go again!

I was quite surprised to go there on a rainy night and discover it half empty at dinner time, though I was happy to be promptly seated.We ordered the mushrooms as part of the starter assortment, and they were like nothing else I've ever had, and lived up to the rave reviews I've seen. Every single dish we sampled in the vegetarian thali was also above and beyond. I will definitely go back to Thali if/when I'm in London again.",

    "text": "One of the things I always look forward to when I get to London is good Indian food. Something my neck of the woods sorely lacks. After reading through Yelp reviews, I decided to give Thali a try. I most definitely was not disappointed!The restaurant is small with a nice low key modern design that does not detract from the beautiful food. Not the garish pseudo luxury decor of so many Indian places. The waitstaff was very friendly and fast without being in your face all the time. Also, the air conditioning works very well so that there are no kitchen smells in the dining area and you don't end up smelling like you did the cooking yourself. Another grief I have with many other places.The menu is sufficiently varied and the wine list is rather extensive for a small place like this. I had the crispy spinach (sorry, forgot the proper name) as appetizer. Light, yet very flavorful and the perfect start. The main course was the non-vegetarian Thali, which is a combination plate of lamb, rabbit, veal, chicken and beef (if my food coma tainted memory serves me right) in small bowls with rice and Raita and a small dessert. The naan bread was crispy and moist.The good even extended to a great cup of espresso at the end. Sorry, I'm Italian-Brazillian and need my coffee...",

They give you about a 1/2 cup of warm tap water and only refilled it twice in an hour (we had to wave people down to get it). The soda we ordered was maybe 5 ounces, and no refills. (No refills is common here, as is the warm tap water. Neither is a problem, but everywhere else has much larger portions.) The most frustrating part was the check. It took about twenty minutes from when we asked for the check to when we walked out. In all the visit was more than an hour long even though we knew what we wanted when we sat down. Lots of time between visits to the table. For what it's worth, everything non-food would probably be rated two stars, but since food is most important for me, it's four in total. Cheers!",

The manager, waiters, and bus boys were attentive and friendly. After our first bite into the prawns (UNREAL FLAVOR) we knew to be excited for the main course (Lamb and Chicken Baghani). The waiter also served us a sample of the crunchy spinach salad, which makes my mouth water just thinking about it, as a kind gesture and to showcase what the menu has to offer. Sitting on the sidewalk, watching the beautiful people and cars pass by and enjoying the best Indian meal I've had to this day in London, was just the experience we had hoped for that night.This restaurant is FANTASTIC and I look forward to my next trip so we can return.

But aside from that the restaurant is quite pretty, nicely decorated, and clean. Service: The hostess / server was really quite rude from the start. She kept texting on her phone in the back of the restaurant and never checked on us. We had to ask to order, ask for more water, ask where the food was, ask for the check. And she spoke in a whisper so it was quite difficult to hear her. It was quite frustrating.Food: -- Aloo Tikka with chickpeas was excellent and the highlight.-- Kachumber salad was fresh and a good compliment to the meal.-- Chicken tikka wasn't that great according to my husband. I don't think the meat quality was quite up to par.-- Crab cakes were greasy and didn't taste like crab at all. We actually returned this dish to the kitchen, which speaks volumes.-- Rice Pulau was excellent.-- Naan had too much butter on it but was fine aside from that.-- Complimentary papadums were excellent. Loved the accompanying mango chutney.Overall: If it weren't for the terrible service I would return here because the food was good for the most part. Unfortunately there are just too many good Indian restaurants in London to go back to one that missed the mark on a few levels.",

I was looking online for a good indian cuisine as my friends had told me the indian chefs in London do go an extra mile and they were not wrong in this scenario. The indian cuisine at Thali features mostly northern indian cooking and a few modern twists.For starters I had a vegetable hara kebab and my friend had a prawn balchao and we both share a few starters of pakora, palak chaat and crab patties. my starter was well made, the combination of green chickpeas infused with spinach and green chilli that was a divine calling by itself. for main I had a vegetable biriyani and a side dish of aloo gobi which consisted of potato, cauliflower and a taste of fresh ginger and lime twist. everything was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I had the best time and my friend too and we can't wait to go back in the near future.",

    "text": "Sadly, after being a loyal customer here for a year, I have to report that the food quality has slid to such a state that I will no longer dine at Thali. After a one hour wait for our palag chaat starter that seemed to have lost its way from the kitchen to the table and arrived soggy and cold, the tandoori salmon I had ordered many times in the past tasted like the fish was purchased 3 days after the expiry date at a Tesco Express. The manager's offer of compensation by way of a free bowl of mango kulfi was greeted with a chuckle and a polite no thanks. Noor Jahan next door is much better so I would suggest eating there instead.",
