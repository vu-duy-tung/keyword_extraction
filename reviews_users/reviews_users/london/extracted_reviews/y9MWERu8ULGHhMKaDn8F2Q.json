The wrap wasn't even steamed!! If anyone has seen a wonton outer wrap uncooked, that was the wrap. The duck is actually suppose to be its crispy skin. They served us overcooked duck bits. Just the worse ever Peking duck! U think they can't mess up some skewers. The skewers were chewy as rubber. I didn't want to order anything else cuz I was too scared.

I may not be Kate Middleton, and my date was definitely not the Duke of Cambridge, but we feasted like royalty at Firecracker. Highly recommended dishes include the inside-out chicken wings, spare ribs and the Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao). Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Even without the voucher, I think Firecracker is good value for money; you'd pay slightly higher prices in Chinatown for a similar spread. Plus their karaoke rooms look amazing - we were in there at the same time as a particularly rowdy party who seemed to be enjoying it, but the magically soundproof doors meant that we weren't disturbed. Would come here again for a karaoke party, as I think it's free with a minimum spend.",

Since it was December the whole place was packed with people from nearby businesses, having their Christmas parties, doing karaokes. If you go there around this time expect to hear a ton of ridiculous and funny performances:)I haven't tried dim sums properly before, so decided to give it a go this time. There are three on the menu which are chef's recommendations, so I took all three. All of those turned out to be quite bad and far from something I'd recommend.Since it was a birthday party we've ordered couple of pitchers of pi\u00f1a colada. Those tasted average, but the amount of alcohol they've put in was a joked. After even three glasses no one felt anything whatsoever in their heads...I also tried sweet and sour chicken which was quite good, so at least I didn't leave the restaurant feeling hungry.Location of the place is pretty inconvenient, the nearest tube is around 15 mins walk away, so if it rains either get a cab or a bus.In general, not impressed, so I don't think I'm coming back any time soon.",

However the total cost of room hire / minimum spend is comparatively higher than anywhere else I've known in Central London or otherwise, the karaoke system did crash once and pricey drinks are bought and carried from the bar yourself.In essence, if you don't mind spending an extra buck for a decent sit-down meal as well as good audio (good singing permitting lol.) then this is the place for you.",

I'm from New Orleans so a bar closing early \u00a0(yes, in New Orleans midnight is early) is a shocker. It is worth visiting with a group.",

Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the chicken skewers with peanut sauce- you want to get this item. It was to die for, perfectly spicy with ginger and creamy peanut. We also had the special fried rice, chicken and spinach gozya, and duck spring rolls- all very good. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "I went there today for lunch on the recommendation of a colleague.As others have said, you descend a rather inconspicuous set of stairs (it must be easy to miss in the dark) and find yourself in a deceptively large two-room space: one with tables and chairs and a banquette, is the main dining room, and off that are four karaoke rooms with \u00a0banquettes and deeply-upholstered chairs..My colleague and I both chose the lunchtime Bento boxes, where you choose a soup, a rice, a main and two side dishes. So, I chose Miso soup, spring rolls, stir-fried mixed vegetables, with tofu and aubergine in black bean sauce for my main course, and steamed rice.The Miso soup came first and actually turned out to be the highlight: the best I've tasted yet in London, and it reminded me of visits to Japan many years ago. It had just the right amount of miso and nori (seaweed) to give it that gently salty, seafood flavour without being over the top.The rest of the meal was perfectly all right, if unremarkable. The mixed veg were slightly over-cooked, and the spring rolls were one spring roll cut in half, and the sauce of my main course was slightly gravy-like in consistency rather than being thick and tangy, as I'm used to. But there was nothing to take exception to, and it came piping hot.Service was fine (though they weren't busy) - polite, quick and unobtrusive. What adds a star to the review was the bill; which (with soft drinks) came to \u00a310 a head before service, so it would be churlish to complain in this part of London, and I'd happily come again for lunch.",

Basic veg stir fry, egg fried rice, hot sour soup come promptly and on mark to our less oil less salt request. Portions are small so add another veg tempura. Nice end to a satisfying dinner. Bill under \u00a340 with 2 small glasses of whites, in a cosy basement of modish red lighting and chill out music, Westminister. Will come back for non-veg dishes another time!",

Both were really tasty albeit very salty. We ordered online on a Friday night, and they delivered about a half hour later! The food was hot upon arrival too. Can't ask for much more from a delivery.If you want a night in with non-dodgy Chinese takeaway, check this place out! Next time I'm feeling too lazy to cook, I'm definitely giving them another call.",

Ordered the vegetable spring rolls with sweet chili sauce, and sweet and sour chicken with fried rice for the entree. Spring rolls were delicious. Cooked vegetables inside crispy roll. My husband thought they could have used meat inside but I thought they were flavorful as they were. Sweet and sour chicken was delicious, tossed in sauce. Peppers and pineapple mixed in. Separate bowl of rice for the meal. Not spicy. Good sized portions. Karaoke happening nearby was entertaining but are in separate rooms, and could not be heard while eating. Overall, a good meal.",

    "text": "We came to this karaoke bar/restaurant ('four rooms providing opulence and luxury', apparently) for a quick lunch - which proved impossible since service is so unbelievably slow. The meal deal is great, with a pick-and-mix bento box for \u00a38.50 including pork belly, roast duck or other meat mains with noodles or rice, accompanied by saut\u00e9ed or steamed vegetables and a corn or miso soup. Quality is good but flavours are nothing special in the interplay between compartments. There is also a dim sum deal but I have long abandoned hope that mid-range Chinese restaurants in London can ever do a decent job with dumplings: only a dozen or so establishments in the Big Smoke really know how to do a small parcel. Vibrant decor, decent food and prices, but expect little attention from the somnambulant waiters. delusionaryculinary",

More like romantic atmosphere. Everything we had was excellent and very authentic. But the portions are much smaller than American size. I thought the dessert was sooo yummy even though it took at least 15 to 20 min for perpetration. Mochi with black sesame seeds (3 pcs for one order) were piping hot and soooo yummy. Coconut tiramisu is very different and not the norm typical tiramisu but it was delicious. \u00a0We will definitely go back again.",

A great dinner for under 10 quid, and I'm full!-Friendly staff: every time I phone in my order, and pick it up, they are so pleasant-KARAOKE too?! Bonus points!
