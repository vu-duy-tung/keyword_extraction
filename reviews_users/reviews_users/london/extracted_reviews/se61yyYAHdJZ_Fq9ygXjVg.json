I invited two visiting friends to join me for lunch and called to make a reservation. They do not accept lunch reservations however they kindly booked me at their last morning slot and said as long as we arrived close to noon that would be fine. All worked out and we had a table in what became a very busy place within an hour. All signs were good at this point and we ordered. In all fairness the food I did receive was ok. I asked the server about getting a lunch portion of a starter and he said that wasn't possible but that I could proceed with the selected item and then order any additional items later. My friends ordered the mussels and a few other things. Fortunately, they enjoyed what they had however the server never returned to inquire about if I wanted anything else. In addition he never returned with the wine list that was requested. I then asked another server who delivered our food, alas no one ever showed again. By the time our server returned my guests had completed their meals and it was inconvenient to order more food or even the glass of wine I wanted.I left sort of hungry, had no wine but a belly full of disappointment. Unfortunately these things happen y'all and if you dine at Bill's I sure hope your experience is better. Sadly, this American Southerner living in London found no thrills eating at Bill's.",

Looking for a place to eat, so much choice in that area, but we walked by Bills and at 2:30pm it was still really busy so we thought we'd take a chance and it was amazing! Great menu, reasonable prices, friendly service. I wanted to try many items but settled on the mushroom vol-au-vent to start, Bills duck pie, then the eaton mess for dessert. My sisters had the ribeye steak, and special fish and chips. My app was great, light flaky pastry, tons of flavor, really well put together and great combination of flavors. The duck pie was a definite standout, absolutely amazing, wanted to go back and order it again today! My sister (who lives in London) said the ribeye was very good by London standards, as she finds it hard to get a really good steak here. The fish and chips was also great, thick piece of haddock, medium thickness batter, not greasy, fresh cut chips. Eaton mess with mango and passion fruit was divine, super sweet though, good for sharing. Overall it was one of the best meals we've had on our visit so far, definitely recommend.",

Most places don't open till 9:00 a.m. or later! Luckily, we found out about Bill's the night before. This place is a gem among the Soho restaurant scene.Breakfast at Bill's goes anywhere from a basket of toast and pastries with butter and three different jams, to pancakes with strawberries and bananas, to full English plates and various egg dishes, and there are plenty of options for vegetarians.The place is funky and fabulous on the inside with a d\u00e9cor, which must be seen to be appreciated. The music went from Reggie, to Memphis Blues, to Jazz without blinking an eye. The servers were friendly, funny, and at times entertaining as the got down to the funky music. There is no London pretension here, only great food, and great service.If you're an early morning person and are up for some fantastic food, get down to Bill's.

    "text": "This place is just great. Great and tasty brunch for under a tenner and who ever would have thought to put basil, eggs, sweet chilli sauce, hummus and guacamole together? This was the standard veggie breakfast and was so far removed from a greasy fry-up. It tasted like it was healthy and fresh, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. I know this is now technically a chain, with quite a few popping up around the city, but you could be fooled into thinking you're in a cosy hideaway spot only you know about. Even on a busy weekend, they appear to always have a table free.I have also been here for the afternoon tea, which was great, and also a steal at \u00a39ish per person and super speedy service.The mains look a bit more expensive (\u00a310-15 per meal), but I bet they're worth it!",

    "text": "** In all fairness, I'd give this place 2.5 stars, but since yelp doesn't do halves.. **Came here for lunch on a Thursday and just.. no, no, no. At 1pm, the place was PACKED. Which usually is a good sign because something so popular can't be that bad, right? UH, WELL... Looking around the room almost everyone's from out of town. That's not to say tourists don't know what good food is, but more often than not, it tends to mean a lot of hype but little substance.Other reviewers have raved about the decor, but I feel like there's a big difference between that and ambience. They've gone for this whole shabby chic country house vibe and whilst I do enjoy the bunches of hanging chillies, they play awful top 40-type hits that, with the loud chatter, blends into a noisy collective murmur. It's not quite the comfortable, laid-back experience you'd hope for.Service was initially pleasant, if a little awkward. But then they kept trying to serve us food that wasn't ours! Elderflower cordial? Chocolate cake? Fries? UH, NO??? There wasn't even the friendly, oh, my bad. Just lots of standing there looking confused. And when we asked for the bill, it was met with, 'oh would you like to order?' WOW. CLEARLY VERY VERY CONFUSED. I understand, busy shift and all, but we've been sitting here for more than an hour with dirty napkins..I wish I could say the food was redeeming but nope. Here's a quick overview:- Sweet potato fries(unseasoned, lacked any sort of crisping on the outside, didn't go well the tzatziki dip at all? What an odd mix of flavours.)- Halloumi and cous cous salad(Cous cous was so bland. It said 'with tomatoes, mint, pomegranate, parsley, yogurt and lemon' so I expected something punchy and a little 'mediterranean' but no, the only flavour was salty halloumi. I could've done a better job at home.)+ Crab, chilli and prawn cakes.(THIS WAS THE ONLY GOOD BIT ABOUT OUR MEAL! The chilli was undetectable, but at least it was crispy on the outside, soft and seafoody on the inside. With a little tart mango salad to go with.)+ Cod and chips with mushy peas.(Huge portion of fish, the batter wasn't bad but again, soggy fries! Still massively average, but it wasn't 'bad' so I suppose it gets a plus)Admittedly, we probably didn't try any of their winners, like the hamburgers (apparently?) but really, with so many great food places in soho, you don't want to waste your time here. Yes, yes, celebrity chef and all that. But frankly, I haven't a clue who Bill Granger is and if his restaurants are anything to go by, I'm not interested to find out.",

Being on the red line, it took us no time to get there from Notting Hill so we took the tube and stepped in to this charming little place.The decor is so cosy and rustic, you immediately feel you've stepped into a French farmhouse setting with big old oak tables, rustic chairs and big bundles of chili hanging down from the ceiling. I went for the veggie breakfast with avocado, chunky hummus, chili sauce, portobello mushrooms, poached eggs, and gluten free break - and it was seriously one of the best breakfasts ever, even my meat loving husband had food envy. Everything went perfectly together, from the nicely poached eggs with runny centre to the hummus with sweet chili sauce. Even the gluten free bread was juicy and good, well done there.Ulrik went for the more traditional breakfast with sausage, portobello mushrooms, bacon, and eggs, and he really enjoyed his food as well - but we both agreed that the veggie version was the better choice. We also had some tea and coffee as well as carrot-orange-ginger juice - the latter being a bit dull so if want to skip something, go ahead and skip that.",

Finally, I gave it a try for brunch and it was a nice surprise ! My brother had the Full english breakfast while I ordered the pancakes with extra bacon. And if you think that nobody can go wrong with pancakes, trust me, I ate some pretty disappointing pancakes in London. But here, the pancakes were really good, the bacon crispy and I got my extra maple syrup really quick after I asked for it : the waitress was really nice and always available.We also tried the chocolate brownie milkshale and it was heaven ! I will definitely go back, especially if all the Bill's in London are this nice :)",

Service was horrendous. Some curly haired girl abused us for not ordering enough appetizers since we were drinking ( we had, by the way, with a different server. They are apparently unable to speak to one another in this joint) and then brought us the wrong drinks and cold appetizers. And the FOOD. Oh heavens and angels and things that sparkle... THE FOOD! I ordered a steak, God's easiest fucking dish to make. You take a piece a meat. And ya cook it. BAM. And a salad. It was the worst thing on the planet. I may or may not have lost a molar chewing on the flesh. The tomatoes were soggy. My dinner guests got sweet potato fries with no salt. The salted caramel cake was so stale you could have choked on it. Lord help this place. NEVER oh never again. EVER.",

The coffee is tasty, also. The wait staff was very pleasant and helpful when dealing with my dietary needs.

    "text": "Although you may hesitate to go to a chain restaurant, I frequent this restaurant because it has such a versatile menu, they can whip up a really honest mocha (not sweet so you can taste the espresso and cocoa), their pots of tea are incredibly generous for one person (2 bags in a large pot), they do everything from brunch to burgers to fish dishes, and an array of fresh salads. The staff are always super quick to seat you, or try to squeeze you in during busy times, they are all very nice and accommodating, and make sure to clear and clean the tables up to maintain an orderly brand. I enjoy the evenings because they break out the old fashion silver candle holders and give the ambiance a really old fashion and rustic feel. Great for an early morning breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or late night dessert or cocktail. Also, during the month of June, if you buy any hot drink whether coffee or tea, they will throw in a free piece of Victoria sponge cake or 2 large raison scones with thick clotted cream and their homemade thick-cut orange or grapefruit preserves. The rinds are candied and really delicious in the jam, and you can even purchase them in-house. Portions are modest (I had a salmon with veg for lunch) so if you come hungry, you may need to order a side or two to split in addition to the entree. Will definitely continue to return at any time of day as it's in a great location on Brewer, a mere stone's throw from Old Compton.",

I had the opportunity to work near by for about 3 weeks, and initially I wasn't sure about Bill's, it's corner location seemed to be the perfect place for a tourist trap, but one working dinner brought me there, and I became a fan. The staff was friendly and prompt, cocktails are delicious, food is made with care, with fresh ingredients, and in reasonable portions. The Menu, drink list, all tastefully designed, not only that, you can tell it's printed by a respectable printer as well. I'm actually a bit surprised that a place like Bill's is able to survive an area like SOHO.Big fan, mad props to the operator.",

I'd chosen the vegetarian break due to the combo of flavors & wasn't disappointed. Humus. Guacamole. Sweet chili sauce. Excellent start to the day. Mrs Ts toast was loaded with avocado & again the flavor from the chili flake and the texture of the poached eggs was unique. Good value especially if you're thinking of paying \u00a320+ for a hotel breakfast in the area. Funky vibe with a wide array of diners & attentive staff. Don't know if consistent across the chain but would definitely recommend",

    "text": "This is solely a review of Bill's comparatively inexpensive afternoon tea.\u00a39.95 for an afternoon is without a doubt the least expensive afternoon tea I have seen in London. This is what drew me to Bill's. This, and the cosy candlelit tables framed by retro interiors which I had seen so many times when just passing by.I took my mum and boyfriend here for a treat after New Year. The tea came served in big pots. No leaf tea in sight, just bagged earl grey, but it was fine for the price. I was pleased to see the traditional three-tier cake stands, one for me as the vegetarian, the other two my boyfriend and mum shared. The lower tier was occupied by the finger sandwiches, the middle tier had some interesting cake offerings and upon the top tier rested a couple of traditional scones with clotted cream and jam.We slowly worked our way up. The cream cheese was very fresh and generously spread, but we all agreed that there were too few savoury options, especially after having gorged ourself on the sweet offerings. The aesthetically-pleasing strawberry cream tart was a little on the bland side, whilst the raspberry almond cake was deliciously moist and tart. The scones were just fine. For the price you get the experience and probably diabetes. This is a decent place to have a traditional afternoon tea, but I have learned from the experience: 1.) That I don't have the sweet tooth I thought I did.2.) That I don't really like afternoon teas.If you have to try the afternoon tea before you leave London and don't have the money to throw at one of those sterile, hotel affairs, this might be your ticket. Also, if you do appreciate afternoon tea you will probably quite like this one.",

Tables were empty, so what is the rush? I had the fish fingers sandwich. That was bigger than thought it would be. It was okay, but not that exciting. Poor beer selection as well. It looked like wine was the alcohol of choice. I heard the risotto was good and I can:t remember what our other friend had, but no one said their dish was really anything, good or bad. We ordered the Eton Mess for dessert. Wow is that sweet, as in too much sugar. I may go back again..",

    "text": "I popped into Bill's Soho on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch with my boyfriend. We have been to this branch of the chain previously, but it has been about a year since we last visited. Little has changed at Bill's- this is consistent across all of its branches both inside and outside of London. The menu hasn't varied greatly over the years, but it represents a good 'something for everyone' selection, ranging from burgers (beef and vegetarian/halloumi options) to salads and grills. The food is primarily influenced by British cuisine with some Mediterranean accents with mezze flourishes of hummus and tzatziki. The food is healthy, uncomplicated and fresh. They do a lovely brunch selection that ends much too early (one o'clock) on a Saturday. The d\u00e9cor is the same across all branches with hanging dried chilies and larder-style shelving displaying the Bill's produce that you can purchase, which includes honeys, jams and various preserves and sweets.On this trip, the restaurant was busy and there was a growing queue of people outside the door. We were seated pretty quickly, however, and the atmosphere was buzzy with conversation and a good selection of music playing overhead. The Soho location is superb for people-watching, as you do see such eclectic groups meandering by! Some of the smaller tables are very close together, but this is usual for central London and didn't detract too much from the enjoyment of our meal. Our table service was friendly and our food arrived promptly- I ordered the chicken kebab skewers on a bed of couscous with tzatziki and pitta bread. It was a reasonable portion, but very skimpy on the tzatziki given that I had a good amount of pitta bread. It was a good and standard light lunch choice even if it was a little bland.My partner had the fish finger sandwich with hand-cut fries, which I eyed enviously- the fish fingers were chunky and homemade, served with tartar sauce in chunky bloomer-style bread. My partner didn't ask about a choice of bread and was slightly disappointed that the default was white, but that's only something we noticed because we so rarely eat white bread at home. He enjoyed the dish and happily finished it- it wasn't greasy or soggy and was a much heartier choice than mine.At the end of the meal, it did take us some time to flag down our server to pay, but this again seems to be the trend in busy central London restaurants.Bill's is a good restaurant for friends and family gatherings- it's always lively and the menu should satisfy everyone's tastes. The prices are reasonable and the dessert menu always tempts me with an excellent selection of British puds (eton mess, sticky toffee pudding, etc.). Some of the branches even do an afternoon tea.",

From the street, Bills \u00a0looks delightful and the decor is well executed, looks fresh, clean, tasteful, \u00a0bit like a Whole Foods little brother store....tinged with an air pretension. \u00a0None of the mass of waiters were unfriendly, they were just unable to cope with the busyness. My party (my flatmate and I) was seated quickly at a 4 person, sloping, table and was tended to by a disinterested waiter whose bouts of interest were poorly timed. The menu actually had some good variety and intriguing items. Yet, \u00a0it was the menu that most egregiously offended me... ironically. \u00a0Let me ask you this: can an English breakfast be \"full\" without toast and beans? \u00a0No. The full English breakfast at Bills amputates the compulsory toast and beans from the \u00a37.95 menu item and offers them up as an extra for an additional \u00a31. \u00a0Yes, it's in London, in Soho...I get it, it's expensive,...but squeeze in some toast and beans for heaven's sake, or at least include it in the price! Of course i opted for something else. The mustard bubble and squeak with eggs and ham. Flatmate got the eggs royale. Taste-wise it was good, but the portion sizes were unsatisfying and we were both hungry shortly after...toast would have helped, haha. \u00a0There was also this audacious menu/order form in order to have the waiters retrieve items from the retail section and deliver right to your table so you can bring some bills home with you. \u00a0I didnt appreciate the presumptuousness of it, considering the overall impression \u00a0i got from bills was that of corporate dazzle rather than sincere service.",

    "text": "A great atmosphere; sort of an eclectic/chic/industrial looking interior with a hipster vibe. A good music selection of trendy tunes, mix of indie sounding stuff and a few by the Beatles tossed in there. Surprisingly a large restaurant with entrance on two corners. Was seated by the manager, very friendly girl. I was happy to find the wi-fi code clearly shown on a small chalkboard hanging from the ceiling, among other chalkboards with writing on them. \u00a0I ordered an americano, it was perfect, complete with mini carafe of steamed milk. \u00a0I also got the cloudy apple juice; also delicious.For breakfast I ordered their Bill's Breakfast with baked beans. I'm visiting London from Canada so this was my first English breakfast experience. I have to say, I've never tasted such delicious sausage as the sausage at Bill's. Soft and juicy. Or maybe all English sausages are this good?Everything came piled on the toast, a really great way to eat breakfast food. The bacon was also very good, nice and greasy. If you're used to \"American style\" bacon this was more floppy and thick, you may prefer it crispier but I personally liked it how it was cooked at Bill's. I had heard that the English like fried tomatoes, I wasn't sure what to expect but they were great and went well with the cooked mushrooms. Could have done without the baked beans added on to it, they were very basic.It doesn't appear to be much when it's all piled up on the toast but everything was surprisingly filling, I was quite satisfied. All staff was super friendly an easy going! A very warm experience. I'm sure to try this place again while I'm staying in London!",

I decided to give their lunch/dinner menu a shot because I didn't really have enough time to search out another option.We were greeted warmly enough and told we could sit where we like. Cool. We chose a spot by the window and promptly received some attitude from the waitress for ordering tap water and asking for a minute to decide on the menu. I ordered the open-face steak sandwich, she ordered the steak, eggs and chips. Our food came out cold, the chips tasted old, and I started to wonder why I even paid Bill's a visit in the first place.If you're in the mood for crap service and even crappier food, come to Bill's and you won't be disappointed.",

All were unique dishes that were tasty and filling. The desert was amazing! Drizzling hot Carmel over a chocolate dome onto vanilla ice cream and brownie... doesn't get much better. Not to mention their cocktail selection was fantastic. I got their special, the name is escaping me but all around great food, great service, great vibes.",

Delayed flight meant we didn't have time to explore our immediate neighborhood on Friday as planned so we left our hotel room Saturday morning a bit unsure of where to head. We'd walked past Bill's the night before so when it came up on Yelp we decided to give it a try. The vegetarian Full English was amazing though I liked the avocado side better than the hummus side. Wanted to go back but never got there though we did see another location in Covent Garden when we returned to London a week later. Allergy-friendly/gluten-free options.",

Bill's is a charming restaurant (both in the NJ/NYC and London called a greasy spoon) in London's Piccadilly Circus. Here you will find a large variety of English fare from my favorite English breakfast to dinner, pastries and puddings. Plus a variety of drinks to tempt the taste buds. When visiting Piccadilly Circus be sure to check out Bill's. And if your an American on holiday, and crave a little of home. Bill's will make you feel like your back in a trendy NYC breakfast cafe.",

    "text": "Arrived in Piccadilly Circus after a trans Atlantic flight. We looked for a traditional English Breakfast and found this place.Around 10-11am on a Thursday and we popped right in and had pleasant service.Foreground is of Bill's Breakfast and across the table is Bill's Vegetarian.It was a good meal.There were some items we didn't care as much for - probably because we aren't used to them. The bacon was great, but the sausage was a little too authentic than what we have in the US where ours is mostly fat and cleaner pieces of meat. This was softer, more delicate and made me really wonder what parts of the pig I was eating. Beans are tomato based too- we're used to more of a BBQ sauce. And then we tried blood pudding- that'll be a one time thing. Nothing wrong with this place though. They did really well on the poached eggs. I would imagine the sausage and beans are pretty much the same as other places around. Just nothing wowed us like most of our other meals did in London.",

But, my boyfriend made dinner reservations here last week before a show at the Gielgud, and I was super impressed. It's a rustic-glam eatery (think wooden benches and glittery chandeliers) and this juxtaposition creates a really pleasant dining environment. The menu is equally great, and has good British food with a trendy twist down to a science.Obviously, I liked Bill's from the start. But just when I thought my life couldn't get any better, I noticed the halloumi burger on the menu - halloumi being perhaps my greatest discovery on this Eurotrip of mine - and decided to try it. Slices of roasted halloumi and a red pepper sat over a bed of rocket, with hummus and greek yogurt dipping sauce on the side. Delicious! The chips that came with weren't bad either, though I preferred the sweet potato ones that came with my boyfriend's buttermilk chicken burger.Service was great, as well - our waiter joked with my (obviously) American boyfriend, our food was prepared quickly, and we weren't left waiting for the bill.Don't think any less of this place because it's a chain - Bill's offers a healthy, creative menu and welcoming service that would be appreciated in any trendy London eatery. And you can bet I'm coming back here for brunch.",

    "text": "We visited Bill's for tea last week, and then for lunch a couple of days ago. Here are my thoughts:Ambiance is really nice and we loved the rustic feel. More importantly this restaurantBill's is very clean and not too noisy. Try to get a table near one of the open windows, if the weather is nice.Service is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Food came out quickly both times.Food is overall quite good.-- Burger was well received by my daughter (portion size isn't too big, her tiny 11-year-old self polished it off in about 5 minutes).-- Seabass with avocado and tomato is pretty good. I wouldn't say the seabass is the best quality though so I don't think I'd order this again.-- Afternoon tea is beautifully presented and quite tasty. The scones and sponge cake were good.-- Husband polished off a brownie dessert...apparently it was very good.Overall we enjoyed eating at Bill's both times and look forward to returning.",

Although my breakfast was pretty basic and looked small, it was still filling and well made, as an American were used to large portions but my plate was just right to where I finished the whole thing. The servers were nice and welcoming even when they found out I was an American eating by myself. Also the decorations and the whole restaurant itself was really awesome, it gave away a hipster/indie vibe to it. I would definitely come here again if I were to go to London again!",

The cappuccinos were delicious!Qnly 3 stars because of the service. Our server brought out our food before she brought our drinks. We asked for our eggs well done, and when we had to send them back because they were runny, she never brought them back until I was almost finished with my meal and my husband went to the front counter to ask about his. Then she ignored us until my husband was on his last couple of bites to see if it had been redone properly. This is a case where having to earn a tip makes sense.Too bad.",

Our check in for our apartment was supposed to be at 1 PM, however it was delayed until 2 PM and we wanted to kill some time and head somewhere but wanted to make sure that they could accommodate us with all of the luggage that we had. We walked into Bill's and they found a perfect table for us in the back where we could leave our luggage next to us without it being in the way of anybody elses table. We ordered the tortilla chips that came with tzatziki, guacamole, and salsa. It was around \u00a33 but the portion was fairly small for 6 of us, probably should have ordered another one. I ordered the BBQ pork ribs which tasted very good, quite messy but expected. Our waitress was very nice and the staff was very accommodating as well.",

Will I give it another go? Probably. The brunch menu looks epic and it's at the end of the road, plus you can always book a decent-sized table and for Soho prices aren't too bad.

We discovered it was just a 45 minute wait just to get in the door! We used Yelp to help find this place...Straight in, seated and in a window seat... happy days. The staff were friendly and water was brought over while we decided what we would like. There was only one thing that we wanted.. a lovely cooked brekkie perfect for a Sunday morning hangover.The place is has a great buzz about it, its quite large and is surrounded by some interesting decor and things hanging from the ceiling. It keeps you entertained while waiting for the food to come. We were definitely feeling good at this point dodging the queue of Breakfast Club.I'd order the breakfast with beans which was only \u00a31 more and I'd asked for something instead of mushrooms to which I received extra bacon + bubble and squeak! (Usually another \u00a31) so I was super happy. The egg tasted amazing and was perfectly cooked. The complimentary B+S tasted delicious. The bacon was how bacon should be and it all worked together so well. The only thing that I thought was a bit weird was that they delivered 2 half slices of bread 1 toasted and 1 not toasted. Must be an aussie thing? The whole experience was great and the super powered hand dryer (Better than Dyson Air blade) in the toilet on departure was just the entertainment I needed before being dragged round the shops on Oxford Street by my girlfriend.I'm working my way up to the breakfast club. \u00a0From what I have heard I think it will be the pinnacle of my breakfast career in London so far. Bills was a great stop climbing the cooked breakfast mountain on a search for the Great British Breakfast.",

Its comes with coleslaw, baby gem lettuce, tomatoes and a tasty chipotle mayo which was the real winner. Also with a side of sweet potato fries. Great spot for a quick bite to eat in a cosy setting for lunch. Even though Bill's is a chain restaurant each branch has it's own different vibe. The staff here are very friendly and attentive. The summer menu looked very yummy even if it didn't match the London weather",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I have reviewed a different Bill's and gave it a pretty crap rating. I never planned on returning to any of their branches but a friend wanted to meet up there and I obliged. The actual restaurant is laid out nicely, the decor and set up of the restaurant is pleasant though you do end up sitting very close to the table next to you.Their breakfast menu is pretty standard and they seem to use free range eggs which is good. I ordered eggs florentine with gluten free bread and the hollandaise on the side and my friend ordered the eggs royale. It came out reasonably quickly yet for some reason was already reasonably cold. The hollandaise was the consistency of butter and the spinach looked like it had been blended and mashed... and there was so much of it it was overwhelming. Fresh spinach would've done fine...! The eggs were nicely cooked though, to their credit. The gluten free bread was okay too. The staff almost to the point of annoying. They checked every two minutes if everything was okay and if we needed anything else, it was a bit much when we were trying to have a conversation and it was literally every two minutes! \u00a0After they took my plate away they did come back and asked what was wrong with the spinach as I hadn't eaten it. When I said i wasn't that much of a spinach person they said... well you did order a spinach dish. Yes, but I didn't expect it to look like it'd been chewed and thrown up again! I guess me and Bill's just ain't going to have a love affair. I find it very sub-par.",

    "text": "Anyone who knows Brighton knows Bills. \u00a0There's a few kicking around not only in London and Brighton now, but all over. Reading, Devon... This is the latest in the long line of Bills. Opened up on Brewers street a couple of months ago and they've done a good job. Prime, watch the world go by position in this Soho corner. It's big. There are lots of tables but comfortably apart so you don't feel you're sitting on your fellow diners. The Menu is really simple and varied and the vegetarian options are, OK. When I asked my lovely waitress what the non meaty options were, she pretty much said 'we've got a few but the hallumi and hummus burger is the only thing'. So, with my lovely nice window seat catching up with some friends I decided to defy that suggestion and went for the macaroni cheese. If I'm honest, it was a bit dry. But it had a nice flavor and was the right portion size. Next time however I will go with the waitress suggestion, The Mrs had (for starters) a fish pie which she tells me is utterly amazing, fresh and overall yum yum. That was followed by a very disgustingly bad for you peach melba sunday. Proper raspberry coli, big fresh bits of fruit, homemade ice cream. The coffee was also surprisingly gorgeous. This place is really famous for its breakfasts and brunches and also offers cream teas. It has an extensive selection of fresh produce and beer brewed is good ole Lewes. Its goods are also offered in the back of the restaurant in a Bills shop which is always nice if you try something you wouldn't mind taking home. Overall its a nice relaxed spot for brunchy/lunchy gatherings. Unpretentious, great service and lovely fresh food.",

I ordered the chicken \u00a0and bacon burger with advacdo dressing. \u00a0The chicken was burnt on the underside but overall was ok. \u00a0Menu had good choices especially if you like seafood and red meat. For stater I had the flatbread with humus and my partner had Cumberland mini sausages in honey mustard dressing, both delicious. \u00a0The choice of menu reminds me of Jamies Italian which for me has very little choice of what I like! For desert I had the blueberry upside down cheesecake... TOP DESERT!",

The desert I chose was an upsidedown cheesecake, initially I had reservations because it came in a small jam jar, but it was very good and I would definitely recommend that for desert. \u00a0Would I go back?

    "text": "You know, I'm going to bump by review of Bill's up by a star, and it's all because their staff was surprisingly amazing this past weekend.Let's be honest, I still have many of the same peeves about Bill's as before: the food is only 'ok' and the prices are a little much, and around noon on a weekend you can kiss the idea of walking in the door and getting a table goodbye.But we've found that for Saturday breakfast, this place is really quite cosy. And the range of gluten-free options is really nice; makes things easier on me, and I don't have to ask the staff a thousand questions they don't have time for. They're actually all very savvy, along the lines of \"if you're gluten intolerant, don't get the sausage, it has rusk in it\", etc. So rare to find that anywhere. Also, their porridge is super good and not overly-sweet the way some places make it, and a great choice for when the weather cools down.This past weekend, there happened to be a small mix-up with my order, aka both our flat whites came with dairy milk instead of the soya we'd requested. At first the server was confused because he was sure he'd ordered soya at the counter (apparently the person making the drinks mixed them up) but then he was super apologetic, and brought over the manager, who was also genuinely concerned that we were ok. Things would have been a little unpleasant had we not noticed, so it was nice to see that the error was taken seriously. I felt a little embarrassed when they actually comped both our meals, but talk about great customer service. You rarely see that in London, and it definitely warrants acknowledgement.",
