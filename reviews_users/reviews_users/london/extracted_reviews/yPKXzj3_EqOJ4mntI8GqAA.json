So, my partner ordered drink and it cost more than 10gbp already but the waiter kept asking me to order more. Why? he told me that the min is 10 gbp per person. Really!!!!! This's so stupid. Why don't you tell me at the first time? Then I decided not to eat and I want to walk out but my partner didn't want to fight. (The waiter told me \" don't be stupid \". How can you say something like this with your customer. I come from San Francisco and I have worked as a sever for 10 years already. I have never heard the rude server like this. ) So, we still eat there. I ate with a bad mood and I didn't finish the food. \u00a0I decided to leave this time. \u00a0 1 more thing, I had asked for the water but didn't get it til we left. Such as bad customer service, bad greedy restaurant. We won't go back for sure.Edit; to the manager, the waiter told me that you are the one who tell he to force us to buy the food with 10gbp min, is that true? My suggestion is to improve your waiter selling skill than telling him to force customer to buy more food even they can't finish it. Thank you",

The space is a bit cramped and definitely not ideal for a romantic dinner, but it's a good spot for a quick meal. However service was so unpleasant from beginning to end that despite the food, I will not be coming back. We were rushed in, rushed out, my seat was so tiny I could barely sit on it (and my bum is tiny). The waitress was pretty rude when I ordered a beer and, rather than asking me for ID straight away, came back a few mins after interrupting our convo with \"you look young\" and? Ask me for ID if you like but what does you look young mean? She just stood there suspiciously looking at me. It was just weird. At the end of the meal my friend and I decided not to pay for service, as it hadn't been remarkable and we are students after all. The guy who seemed to be in charge got extremely worked up because we didn't want to pay for service and demanded that either me or my friend paid for, despite us asking \"isn't service optional? And his answer being yes. He became really aggressive and said \"you have to let us know before you start eating if you are going to pay for service or not\". Why? Because so you can treat me accordingly? Woah. Honestly all this fuss for less than a fiver.. He could have handled this in so many better ways, there really is no apology.",

I came here with Neil C. and family for a quick bite to eat before some Birthday drinks in London and we we're not disappointed. The menu is vast and will suit almost everyone. As a starter I had soft shell crab - which was definitely a stand out dish and was the centre of all food envy on the table! My main course was a dish which comprised of vermicelli noodles and steak. It didn't quite live up to the glory of the crab starter, but was still good nonetheless. A couple of Hanoi beers later we thanked the guys at Viet Food for their hospitality, paid the very moderate bill and left in search of more beer! Hurrah.",

The place is and looks newish, though it is fairly successful from what I have seen. Good mix of locals and tourists (it is very central), and a quite long menu to choose from, making it a good spot while cruising in the area. Will go back today and will udpdate or not this review.",

After walking around Chinatown and got excited seeing Viet restaurant in London, I walked in hoping to have a yummy hot bowl of pho (this was around late night-not busy hour). The restaurant wasn't busy. They had a big high top table and a high bar section at the window available, but I didn't want to sit up high since I'm pregnant so I patiently waiting for a small table since all the customers at the two small tables already finished and about to leave. The one guy was nice and he even suggested us to wait a little for the small table. But then while he was cleaning the small table and setting it up for us, a group of 5 and 3 came in. The big high top table was perfect for the 5, the window bar area was good for 3, or even if, just let us know or asked if we're ok to sit at the high bar area instead? But the other guy (who I guess could be the owner) came out and asked the guy who was still cleaning table whats going on and when he explained that we're waiting for that small table, he just cut the guy off and told us to sit at the bar area, no choice! As a customer, I felt really disrespected. So I left. It doesn't matter how good your food is or not, if I have a chance or even offered to eat for free, I would never go to this restaurant. Rude and unacceptable way of treating customers!",

    "text": "Recently Dozo opened it's new sister restaurant Viet Food, specialising in Vietnamese cuisine. The restaurant is based on the south side of Wardour street, next to the gates of Chinatown.I was quite excited to have lunch there as I really like Vietnamese dishes.I went for lunch with my friend Melissa Foodie . The place was busy, so we only managed to get a table on the ground floor next to the entrance with a view of the kitchen.To start our meal, my friend ordered a tea. Unfortunately because of the trendy use of enamel glasses to serve tea in this restaurant she didn't manage to drink it until the end of her meal as it was too hot to touch.We shared two starters : the coconut calamari with sweet chili and the Vietnamese spring rolls. Both starters were good and crispy. I didn't really taste coconut while eating the deep fried calamari but they tasted lighter than the classic ones. The sweet chili sauce was quite tasty, it came in a small tube which gave a modern touch to the dish.Regarding the spring rolls they were pretty small andI only had a tiny bite however my friend seemed to enjoy them. She switched the classic nuoc cham sauce for the spicy red sauce available on our table.As a main dish my friend ordered the Pho Chin which was a slow cooked marbled beef in soup. To quote my friend, she thought her pho was literally a bowl of hot water and tasteless noodles. It was the worst pho she had for a long time. I tried a spoon of her pho and it's true that it could have been a bit more flavourful. It was nothing compare to the pho I tried at Ngon Ngon.My dish was a bun tom nurong, a massive plate of plain noodles with coriander, mint, cucumber and chargrilled fresh tiger prawns. It came with some nuoc cham sauce to pore over the plate. It was alright but there was nothing really special about it. Again it needed a bit of flavour to be better.Overall I don't think I will go back to Viet Food \u00a0and so does my friend, as apart from the starters, the dishes were flavourless. I would rather commute to get a proper good and tasty Vietnamese meal in Clerkenwell (Ngon Ngon or Banh Mi Bay) or in Shoreditch (Mien Tay).",

The portion was the fried spring roll felt a bit on the small side though, 3 small rolls on a plate.The rice summer rolls we got would have tasted bland but with the hoi sin sauce it was not too bad.

The waitress initially had no problem serving us but after walking away she came back and abruptly told my friend \"you look young\" followed by another just as abrupt \"how old are you?\". this approach could have been a lot more digestible if she'd asked politely to begin with for an ID. As she walked away she turned her head and gave a pretty nasty look in our direction. The starters arrived and were both lovely, as were the mains but unfortunately this won't be the focus of my review. As we finished our meal we saw the \u00a34.30 service charge on the bill and neither of us were prepared to pay it so we paid separately for our food -the service. Upon noticing this the waiter (maybe manager?) got riled up and confrontational demanding someone either pay or we give a valid reason as to why neither of us were. This discourse went on for maybe 5 minutes before he landed on \"You have to tell us as you come in that you're not going to pay service\" which seems pretty unreasonable to me. Overall a pretty negative experience. If they sort out their waiting style there could be redemption.",

Great for tapas style small places and the pho was pretty tasty too.

They have two creation of their own juice. I tried the Wow Wow which came served in a mini milk bottle for \u00a33.50. Although it was a cute way to present juice but it was I felt it was too expensive for the amount of juice that was served at that price tag. I thought the hot drink we tried, lemongrass tea (\u00a31.90), which is served in a teapot was better value.For food we tried their Tradition rice paper summer roll with prawns (\u00a35). It was like your typical size Summer roll witu all the greens and herb that had been rolled together. A nice way to open up a meal!We ordered two of the chef selection dishes to try and the portion size was small. These dishes are good to have with rice and give an alternative to having noodle. From the chef selection, the tender belly pork was\u00a37.50 for only 3-pieces of average chopped belly pork and the portion size reminded me of House of Ho. But I did not think it was as good and thought it needed to be brasied longer as it was not tender enough.The Chargrilled lemongrass chicken for \u00a36.50 was nice with succlent moist chicken. Full of flavour and it wrnt well with the pickle vegetables that the chicken sat on.There are five different phos to select from the menu. We tried the pho with the lean rare beef. The broth was fragrant as you would expect from a Vietnamese pho.Bun is a vermicelli noodle that is served like a salad. Each one is toped with cucumber, bers, peanuts and a choice of pork, beef or prawn. They are all serve with a fish sauce which you need to pour over the dish, otherwise the dish is dry and bland.Overall, the decor of Viet food was nice but the food didn't stand out for me to say \"Woah\". I would visit again but wouldn't rush to. However there will be some dishes I would not order again, such as the belly pork. I probably stick to their pho and bun.",

    "text": "I came to this restaurant bc of the fact that Jeffery Tan is a chef that worked at a Michelin star restaurant, Hakkasan. He is also considered as one of the UK's top Asian chef. To say this and then attached his name to this restaurant, it was super disappointing. I didn't expect the food to be authentic bc I knew it was going to be a more Vietnamese inspired cuisine. However, to put it on the resume of the restaurant and use the words Michelin star anywhere near it. It is just wrong. The service was one of the worst service esp. With the backing of a named chef. I had the Pho and the lemongrass chicken. The chicken was tender but salty and greasy. And it does not come with rice like most Asian cuisines. The pho is not authentic but the noodles was made perfectly. The flavor of the soup was decent. The meat itself was ok. They were more like leftover small pieces of meat vs big thin slices of meat in the typical Pho. Nor do they provide you with sriracha and oysters sauce to go with pho. Instead they have fish sauce and a housemade sour chili sauce. But like I said, the service was horrible! I had the server Nick who basically ignored me and gave me attitude from the moment I sit down. I waited a while before he took my order; moreover, the table behind me had ordered and even gotten their water. I had to ask for my water after seeing that other people was getting their's. If I had asked him anything like sriracha or hot sauce, he acted very annoyed. I had to go get it myself. And my water glass was empty till the end of the meal. No one came and checked on me. Even when I had finished my meal, I sit there staring at Nick to see if he would come over and clear my table and present the check. And the answer was no! He just looked over me. Finally, when another server had came over to help me bc she saw I had left my credit card on the table ( as a signal that I am ready to pay and please bring me my bill). And it was only then that the assistant manager came over to apologize bc I had asked for the male server's name when I was closing out. He asked if something had happened that would caused me to ask for the server's name and if he could offer me a complimentary dessert. And that if I come again, they will take care of me. But honestly, by that time, it was too late. I did not want to be in that restaurant a second longer. I am not complaining for a free meal or dessert. I regretted going to the restaurant. I rather take my money and eat at somewhere with better attitude. The food wasn't good enough for me to come back with this kind of service. I guess it was my mistake to expect more bc Jeffery Tan is the proprietor of the restaurant. So I expected something more in lines of Michelin star food or service. Or at least one that aspires to be. \u00a0 \u00a0And lastly as a foodie, I would recommend when a restaurant chooses to serve the dishes outside of the traditional style and tradition - to have servers talk and explain the concept of the restaurant and how they want the food to be ordered and served. And that is part of the service you would expect out of any nicer restaurants like Nobu and Hakkasan. Or just don't attach ur name and the words Michelin star anywhere near the restaurant, Viet. I am writing this review bc I want to let other have a more realistic expectation. If you go in there, and see it as a hole in the wall whatever restaurant in Chinatown like most of the other restaurants out there (whatever service whatever food), you will have a better time.",

Ordered the spring rolls, the Vietnamese pancake, a sweet beverage with a raspberry and mint on top, beef with okra, pork chops, and plain/lemongrass rice. The spring rolls were ok, just didn't like how they stuck them together so pulling them apart my lead to tearing of the rice paper. The pancake wasn't what I was expecting but reminded me of a Mexican version of it. The beverage was definitely worth a buy because it was good amount of sweetness to it. The beef was alright and the pork chops had good amounts of flavoring with the sauce. Rice was basic as it should be. I only give this place a 3 star because of the price and the environment. It can get rowdy because customers are trying to speak to their party which leads to screaming over each other. Since there wasn't room, we had a share a table, Hong Kong style which isn't a problem for me, especially when I'm super hungry. Food portions were tiny and the service was okay for the amount of customers they had. In the end, I wouldn't come here again unless I wanted to experience the environment.",

    "text": "Viet Food is a relatively new restaurant that's opened on Wardour Street in Soho / Chinatown area. I'd actually only been to Wardour Street on the Soho side, and hadn't quite realized that the street continued into what I consider the Chinatown side - that is, south of Shaftesbury Avenue - and that's where Viet Food is. When we arrived, there was a handful of people waiting outside, who apparently had come without a reservation. One of them slightly protested when I was able to walk in without a wait for an 8:30 reservation (so I definitely recommend booking ahead). We had a table upstairs right next to the no-longer-operational fireplace. It's a really nice space, not sprawling spacious, but also considerably better than the tight squeeze I experienced at Leong's Legends Continues a few doors down. We really liked the birdcages that hang as decorations above the stairs - though thankfully they are without actual birds.As for the food, I got the coconut calamari starter and a beef sirloin stir fry accompanied by a serving of rice. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. My friend got the chargrilled lemongrass chicken and the pho tai. I thought the coconut calamari was really interesting, and liked that it was different than your typical fried calamari plate. The sweet chili sauce that accompanied it came in a very cute vial that I wouldn't have minded taking home. The beef sirloin stir fry was tasty, and quite a decent sized portion. I don't think I could have eaten a third dish. I tried some of the lemongrass chicken and it was wonderfully tender. It is definitely one of their signature dishes. And I didn't try the pho, but it looked good and it was a standard sized bowl of noodles - that's enough for a meal by itself, in my opinion! They had the cool wooden ladle spoon that some ramen places in London have.Overall, I was very happy with the dining experience. I'd say this is a more casual, low key place, and probably not somewhere you take someone you are really trying to impress. But for Vietnamese, it's a step above the chain food of Pho and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of Kingsland Road eateries. For a quick, tasty bite after work in central London, it totally hit the spot.",

There's a total of three levels, the top level is a bar where most people waited until a table became available. It's where I watched a skilled bartender mix up some very beautiful and tasty cocktails.Decor is funky, a touch of street Vietnamese with a fresh twist. There were lots of attentive staff running it like a well oiled machine. As we were on a time crunch for a musical, they got us in an out within an hour. My Ho Chi Minh cocktail was delicious and refreshing. Food was good as well. Betel wrapped meatballs as the starter packed plenty of flavour. The beef sirloin salad with rice noodles was a big portion for one or good to share. My companion got the same salad but with three kinds of pork. The salad was very light and lacked much punch so you need to spice it up yourself. They bring fish sauce and there are two kinds of chili salsa on the table.Overall it was a great meal in a fun atmosphere. I'll definitely return to sample from their tapas menu.",

But the benus and pohs at Viet Food are just so much more appealing than the MSG-sodden eat-all-you-like buffets and better value than the a la carte outlets.This end of Wardour Street seems to attract a fair number of new Asian restaurants and Viet Food seems by far the best, hence the return visit. I think I even ordered the same as the chicken curry just looks far too tempting on the picture card to resist.Based on the food alone I would give a four if not five star rating. Unfortunately, this was let down by the service. I asked for tap water with my meal (this really shouldn't be an issue in London anymore) and was reminded that minimum credit cards payments are \u00a310.

    "text": "Not that hungry as we walked around China Town (had a full, heavy lunch around 1pm at Zizzi's) but decided we should find a place to have dinner soon as the restaurants were getting crowded. Viet Food was highly recommended by my friend's teenage son. The place looked packed so we were like \"sure, lets give it a try\". We got a table on the second floor, a table for four. Table kind of tiny and the chairs (or, i should say, stools) were tiny as well so if you're on the heavy side it might not be a good idea to sit on those stools. The place was pretty clean. We had a very kind waiter (he was young and he wore glasses) who reminded me of a childhood neighbor. Anyway, much to our surprise, we finished every bit and piece of our food. We were stuffed and satisfied! Never mind the chairs coz when you go out and eat, it's the taste of the food that matters most. Thank you, Viet Food, for the sumptuous dinner.",

The spicy beef soup had an odd flavour which wasn't unpleasant but it wasn't how spicy beef noodles taste in authentic Vietnamese restaurants along kingsland road. It's okay if you want a bite to eat, just don't expect authenticity. The rare beef pho tasted okay, although I had to squeeze a lot of lime into it. It's def better than some of the other \"Vietnamese\" restaurants I've tried, but doubt I'll be going",

The outside appearance of Viet food seemed very welcoming and upon entering, we were lead to the mezzanine which is really cozy, especially on a date night.We started of with shrimp crackers, Vietnamese spring rolls with pork and shrimps and a salad as shared appetizers; both dishes were delicious and perfect with a bottle of local beer. For our main, we ordered spicy pork belly, garlic fried rice and chicken Pho to share and the portion size was good for two people. They were delicious and freshly made. The customer service is wonderful and we did not wait that long to be seated. Our food arrived on timely fashion and the staff were genuinely nice and helpful. Probably not the best Vietnamese restaurant in London, but there isn't really anything to hate about it. I will definitely come back!",

    "text": "This is posh street food but quite pricey. I really do not understand why when you have a bowl of pho that after a few mouthfuls, you are fishing in the soup for the pho and the meat, because there is not enough thus leaving you wanting and the dish not good value. It is very tasty, but not enough. Take a leaf out of Cafe East, it feels bottomless and really filling. \u00a0The summer roll is beautifully displayed but the sauce is just not right, \u00a0they used the same sauce as for crispy duck and added the peanuts and chili, which just does not cut it for me, as it is too savoury. It should be the sweet and sourness of the plum sauce with peanuts and chili. \u00a0That would be the perfect dip for the summer roll.The dish they do well is the pomelo salad with prawns. This is a dish with many flavours and textures. The citrus juice of the plump pomelo and the plump prawns goes well with the sweetness of the fish sauce and the crispy fried shallots provides the crunchy texture combined with the coolness of the salad of \u00a0vegetables is such a delicious and delightful dish. They really have got this right.Get a seat facing the window, and you can watch the world go by, which adds to the atmosphere of eating street food.",

My pho felt authentic enough, but had an odd anchovy aftertaste, which I did not like. They also didn't have sriracha sauce -- an essential when it comes to Vietnamese food for me. Our starters were once again, average at best. Ambience was okay -- cool and hip. A combination of Vietnamese hole-in-the-wall meets hipster bar-esque place. Service was overall good, with the staff being generally prompt. No major concern nor praise. Wouldn't mind going back, but only after I've explored other better pho places first.",

The place is small its spread into two levels as for me a wheelchair user so I can't head up to the upper level. That is the building done but the stardom the show is the food. I am not a fan of spicy food but I had 'morning glory ' it's a salad but it had light chilli sparsely through it if chilli is not your game then there's the garlic version. For my main I had the sea bass in banana leaf with a lemon grass rice so another successful meal had there I think I'm beginning to become a regular, it can get fairly busy at times so a queue might be there.",

The pho soup was on the bland side. \u00a0The portions were not as large as back home (you will still be full) and definitely costs more (\u00a38.80 compared to avg $9.00cad). \u00a0The beef in the pho actually tasted better than the ones I've had at home in that the beef tasted like thinely sliced, soft tenderloin steak. There wasnt much condiments on the table either such as chili sauce, hoisin sauce, and siracha. It did come with fish sauce however. \u00a0The ambiance is nice and the restaurant was clean. \u00a0Service was good and waiter was attentive. \u00a0Overall I had a good experience.",

My beau and I were craving some kind of Asian food (our mutual love of it being one of the things we bonded over!) and this place had a table ready right away. Albeit a communal square table, which we quite happily shared with a cute old Indian couple who I think were trying to suss out if we were married, and 4 French girls who seemed to be enjoying themselves.The upstairs d\u00e9cor is beautiful - the shutters had a very authentic feel and I loved the light features they'd made out of bird cages over the staircase. I enjoyed my bun with 'chargrilled three of pork' which I think meant pork cooked 3 ways! I wasn't sure about the 3rd way but the other 2 and the noodles and fresh veggies were very tasty, though the flavour of the sauce got a bit too strong for me towards the end. Sadly my guy's pho with marbled beef didn't appear until I'd practically finished eating, but was very speedily devoured! We appreciated the beer selection too with a Hanoi and a Saigon between us.The staff were friendly and efficient, and suitably apologetic about the delayed food once they noticed us looking around expectantly. It's at the pricier end for this type of food and I think I still prefer old fave CoBa up by King's Cross. My guy and I are also quite happy eating street food on the street, but I'd return if I was with peeps that like their street food in poshed-up surroundings, as this is a lovely setting!",

The trailblazer for this up-scale style of Vietnamese food, House of Ho in Soho has just shut despite the backing of a celebrity chefThis site used to house a basic Vietnamese restaurant but has just had a makeover. Among the new decorations are cookbooks including one from Slanted Door, a restaurant in San Francisco which this place must be trying to emulate - it's high-end Vietnamese with endless throngs dying to eat there but with eye-watering pricesThe menu here is lovely. A mixture of street food noodles, specials and tapas style dishes. Its desire to be higher end means four things - smaller portions, beautifully presented food, higher prices but more precise flavours on the palateThe pho was lovely. Big, wholesome and hearty. The spring rolls had a very interesting crispy skin. Very enjoyableI got stung by the non alcoholic cocktail though. Great flavours but tiny glass and to add insult to injury, most of it filled with ice. \u00a34.80 is criminal for what I receivedI'd go back as there are other interesting dishes but I'll stick to water",
