The music was a bit too 80's and a bit too loud for B that early in the morning. Their toast, a big, very thick slice was tasty. You won't need much else for breakfast afterwards. My tea was just fine, B's coffee was deemed quite good. They offer more substantial breakfasts, plus salads and burgers for lunch/dinner. There's also a takeaway bar, particularly good for your morning coffee. They do the whole range of espresso drinks. Very friendly vibe, usually busy in the evenings. When they open the windows, it's especially nice. There's a cute room in the back that can be reserved for groups as well. Oh, and the loos are quite fun.",

I wanted to love this place before I'd even eaten anything. \u00a0Thank goodness the food is also stellar. I had the american breakfast, the big breakfast smoothie, and a cup of coffee. I was knocked out of the park by how good the smoothie was, it was totally worth the money and was my favorite thing I've eaten since I've got to London. The breakfast was pretty good, the meat portions especially. Get something with sausage when you go, they make a fantastic piece of sausage. The pancakes were good too. The only exception to the goodness was the eggs. I had them scrambled, and they tasted powdered. the meal was on the pricey side, and I feel for what I paid, they shouldn't be powdered or taste like it. The coffee also has the distinction of being the only kind I've ever liked black. (I didn't order it black, but the waiter just dropped it off and never came back, and as they were super busy and I didn't mind)In short, you should go. You should have a smoothie and enjoy the atmosphere. You may have a bit of a wait, we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated, but the staff is friendly and you won't want to leave.So it's worth it.",

    "text": "\"Don't queue... Forget about me.\"This should be the theme song for this restaurant with the same name as the quintessential John Hughes movies from the 80's. When I arrived, I thought I would be having an experience similar to Allison: kooky, sexy and fun. What I received was more like Brian: plain, boring and trying way too hard to fit in.There was a queue when we arrived and it only took us about a half an hour to get in, so it wasn't bad, but I did overhear someone mention that she didn't understand why there was a queue because there was plenty of seating inside. (Maybe that's why it went so fast.)When we got in and seated, we were at the center shared table. I'm down with that sort of dining. The decor was very eclectic in that wanna-be hipster sort of way. Trying way too hard to look like they're not trying at all.We started with Bloody Marys and ordered four meals (there were three of us, but ever since I was introduced to \"table waffle\" by some friends, I'm always doing it at brunch now): The Full Monty (a full English), The All-American, Huevos ala Benny and Banana and Bacon French Toast. The Bloody Marys were absolutely terrible. We drank them quickly so we could move on to Prosecco and orange juice. The Full Monty: Your standard English breakfast. Except almost everything was sub-standard. The black pudding was dry and thick and not at all delicious. Of the two poached eggs, one was slightly overcooked and the other was completely overcooked. The bacon was hard and chewy and not at all good. The toast had no butter so was dry and gross. The mushrooms and potatoes were alright, nothing special. The only good thing on the plate was the sausage (which they probably don't make themselves).The All-American: Dry, overcooked and rubbery pancakes. I'm not a chef, I'm probably your better-than-average home cook. I definitely make better pancakes. What a disappointment. I saw a sign for Pancake Tuesday saying eat 12 in 20 minutes. I wouldn't want to eat one of their pancakes in 20 minutes let alone 12 of them. At least the poached eggs on this plate were cooked right. The Huevos: This was the only good plate of food. Everything was actually quite tasty. One of the poached eggs was slightly overcooked, but the other was perfect. I felt bad because this was my meal, and I was probably the only one of the three of us who enjoyed it.The French Toast: If by now you're still thinking about coming here (which I highly recommend NOT doing), do not order the french toast. It was by far the worst french toast I've eaten. The bread was BARELY dragged through the egg wash which left the inside rock hard and chewy. Very tough and no flavor. To soften it up, I poured on twice as much maple syrup. It made it edible. It made me sad. I made french toast at home and it was insanely better than what they try to pass off as french toast here. The bananas were just chopped up and thrown on top (it would have been nice for a bit of caramelization to bring out some of the banana flavor, but no they were just cold chopped up bananas.) The bacon was all right, and there was lots of it. A note on the home fried potatoes. I liked them. Neither of my dining partners did. They both complained that they needed more flavor and needed to be crispier.I was surprised at how quickly the meal came out. The kitchen really cranks out the food. However, I think I would rather have them make GOOD food instead of FAST food. When I go out, I expect to be eating food that I either can't make at home. If I can make it at home, I expect a restaurant to do a better job. I could pretty much whip up any of these dishes at home (and far better). Probably because I actually would be putting the time in to try to make it good instead of whatever the chefs here think they're doing.The straw that broke the camel's back was the orange juice we got to make Mimosas (that's Buck's Fizz to you Brits) out of the Prosecco. When it arrived, it was full of ice. Really? No one wants ice in their juice. Especially if you're using it to add to bubbly alcohol. I'm already diluting it, I don't want to have ice floating around in my bubbly. It's just plain wrong.At least the service was reasonable. Friendly faces abound.Which is pretty much my opinion of The Breakfast Club. Plain wrong. Good in concept but very poor in execution. By the time we were ready to leave, there was still a queue outside. And a slightly empty looking restaurant. It seems that they keep a queue outside for the hype instead of letting people sit down. And they need the hype because the food is pretty terrible. But we all know that Brits love to queue and the sheer act of queuing seems to make things better. Not for me, and I will not be coming back.",

He warned me there could be a long wait but it that it would be totally worth it.As we got there we noticed the queue was going half way down the street, with a lot of cold and hungry looking hipster-type people waiting. My friend assured me that it would be worth the wait - and to be honest if people are prepared to wait half an hour or more for some food then it can only be a good sign, right?Well after a half hour wait, we finally got inside and were shown to hour seats by a lovely member of staff - she was bubbly and enthusiastic and made me feel most welcome. What can I say about the menu! My god - AMAZING!! Absolutely every type of breakfast you can think of, American-Style pancakes, waffles, English Breakfasts, Breakfast Burritos and a whole lot more. They also have a really good vegetarian menu so the veggies won't miss out!I opted for a full English, My friend had the breakfast burrito. At just under ten pounds it was a lot cheaper than I expected it to be, especially with it being in super-pricey Hoxton!I loved everything about the place, it was very busy but the staff were really cool and helpful, and the decor was great too.My only wish is that they open a Breakfast club in Brighton - they would make an absolute killing!!",

They don't take reservations in the morning though, so sometimes you'll have to wait outside in the cold but once you get a table, you can enjoy trendy music and some of the best service I've had in the city. The menu has everything from eggs, to beans, to bacon (if you want American bacon, i.e. crispy thin bacon, you must ask for \"streaky bacon\"). They also have black pudding, vegetarian sausage and a variety of smoothies plus sweet breakfasts like pancakes. The Breakfast Club is a good option for vegetarians because they have a lot of vegetarian meals indicated as such. Not so sure for vegans because most things will have eggs or some kind of milk. This restaurant is in the heart of the trendy SOHO disrict of London but don't let that fool you. The service is just as friendly as if they were in a smaller location and really needed your business (at other places like this , that areoften packed, so you could think they might not care about an individual client but really, not the case here.) The waiter was attentive, always checking that we had enough juice, coffee, if we needed anything, if the meal was ok. Everything. The food is great. I had the eggs with streaky bacon and veggie sausage. The veggie sausage is made from tomatoes and mozza so takes some getting used to.The one thing I'd say is that you should probably order tea here as the coffee was a little disappointing compared to the greatness of the overall meal. Not terrible, just a little bitter and less flavorful than I usually like. But drinkable. All in all, I will keep this address for my next trip to London!",

I had never been to this location, but was won over, even after the 30 minute wait.Yes, arriving at 1pm, we waited about half an hour for our group of 5 to be seated. \u00a0Considering there was a menu posted outside, we were ready with our orders right away. \u00a0I dove in with a strawberry shake, huevos rancheros, and split a pancakes and berries with a friend. \u00a0Huevos ranchers were delicious -- the only thing spicy was a sauce that was one side, but the rest of the place was superb -- tortilla with melted cheese in the middle, 2 fried eggs, sour cream, guacamole, beans and 2 sausages. YUM. And for something sweet -- pancakes with berries -- four panckaes served with just the right about of syrup and berries and a MOUNTAIN of cream. \u00a0Needless to say, I was not very hungry by dinner time. \u00a0I was still dreaming about my brunch at the Breakfast Club.Not raving about the shake, as it wasn't anything special. \u00a0I honestly might try a smoothie the next time.All in all, a definite keeper.",

And a queue of at least a quarter of hour in front of the door.But if you just spent a great night with somebody (ok well at a second thought..... if you spent a great night with a friend in visit or something like that, not really for your morning-after date!) then this is the place where to have a good robust breakfast the morning after.You have american breakfast, english breakfast, and a lot of other things, toasts, pancakes etc! And it's just good, really good!Probably my rate is biased by the fact that I'm not the most experienced person for judjying an american breakfast (damn I'm italian, my best breakfast will always be a cappuccino&brioche!), but I love this place, and every time a friend of mine is in town I bring them here!",

I was walking around on Easter Sunday starving like a whore in church. Everything in sight was closed, kept walking and out of the corner of my eye saw a sign that read \"Breakfast Club.\" So I did what any lost Angeleno would do and cut right to the front of the line and told the girl with the perky fun bags I need to grub as bad as she needed dental work. I made my way to the back of the restaurant and noticed there was more talent here than my last family reunion.I sat down, ordered a bloody mary to get things going (they add chopped cucumbers which is cool) and then ordered the chorizo, eggs and potato dish. On freakin point! The food was not only hearty and good but it wasn't greasy as you would come to expect. The menu can be considered to be very Americanish probably because its loaded with pancake and omelet combos and other diner type items. They also have traditional English breakfast items but then again I'm no connoisseur. \u00a0Either way I highly recommend you give this place a try if your looking to have a great meal in a trendy environment.",

I quickly got over it though when I was told that I just HAD to go check out the bathroom (which I dutifully documented for you: yelp.com/biz_photos/ao-y\u2026).Great decor aside, the food here is pretty decent but not exactly \"American style\" as some reviews claim - we don't have bacon this good in the United States. Being afraid of what I'd heard about black pudding, I opted for the Half Monty. It was so filling I can't imagine what the Full Monty would have done to me. I mean I'm a pretty hearty eater, but even I have limits, you know?In closing: Fraggle Rock wallpapered restrooms. Great bacon. Go.",

And it worked \u00a0(we had previously tried the Soho outlet, and given up after waiting for 1 hour).My general impression of the place is that it is a bit overrated: the food is really good, but a bit to pricey and the service sort of makes you feel as if you were brunching in a factory. We had two sets of american breakfasts, and Two blueberry pancakes. Both came in great quantity and every thing was tasty and filling to say the least.But clients keep coming in and out and waiters are a bit overwhelmed: we had to wait a lot and ask several times each time we had something to ask (be it water, or the check or the card machine) and they were not making any effort on being agreeable. I'm quite sure there are several places in London where you can taste equally tasty food, at a better price and with better service.",

The menu is split into breakfast/brunch (running till 5pm) the the dinner menu (which still contains some breakfast items) takes over. All the key dishes you'd expect from an American-ish diner are there. Your huge eggs, breakfast burritos and French toast have all been sampled and they're just great. The vast amount of sides available also allow you to really make the plate of food yours. (I mean, always throw on extra advacado!)...BUT, the pancakes are incredible. Huge stacks of fluffy and moist cakes with lashings of what ever makes you tick. We went for some fruit and the vanilla cream, which is somewhere between the cream between an Oreo, whipped double cream, oh and heaven. Seriously order what you need, then add pancakes!The setting is very cool, it feel like the antiques roadshow have had a huge blowout party but it all works. Smeg fridges, old pianos, number plates on the walls and mismatched chairs and tables. It works. The staff are more than helpful and really work hard to make your experience a good one. The only watch out??? The line! Morning in the weekend can stretch to an hour and even mid-week I've seen 20-30 mins. But there are other ones in Liverpool St and Angel, so can all be fixed with a short tube ride. You've got to go here and get involved, especially good with friends or family visiting from out of town!Now, more pancakes...",

It all looked and tasted great, until my boyfriend kept finding egg shell in his eggs, then thick hairs in both of our cocktails (underneath the ice, not even floating on top).We told the nearest waiter to us whom didn't seem bothered. He took the drinks away and came back rolling his eyes saying \"what do you want to do?\" \u00a0- I suspect he thought we were trying to get out of paying though it hadn't been mentionedEventually we said we were just going to leave the rest of the food and go.

And if you plan on eating your breakfast for dinner, there are a few alcoholic drink options to choose from.

Unlike it's sister venue at Liverpool Street (which usually has a waiting line going down the street), I've never seen this restaurant quite so packed out. The restaurant staff are friendly, and will generally go out of their way to make sure you have a good dining experience.On our visit, we arrived shortly before 5pm (when their day menu changes to their evening menu), and we were given the wrong menu. After having to compensate for a couple of things in our late, late breakfast (who doesn't want Mexican refried beans in lieu of baked beans?), our waitress was very apologetic. In the end, she struck off the jug of fruit smoothie from our bill - Result!The full English breakfast is about as good as a breakfast usually is, without all the ingredients being ridiculously sourced from exotic animals. All the trimmings were on the plate, and a lovely evening breakfast was had.Also, the Americans-style pancakes are definitely recommended. Ask for extra maple syrup.. because there's no such thing as too much maple syrup. Yum!",

The queue really isn't that bad - I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes and it's always well worth it.",

    "text": "Hmm.. okSo I had a really cool memory of the breakfast club, from when Chris O. and Mei L. had dinner there, and we came and joined them after the Yelp GoGame (wasn't that an awesome 4th of July game!! - YeeHaw!!)So, I'd already experienced the ubercool toilets disco, and tasted a few morsels of falafel and hummus. \u00a0So we decided to come and check this place out for our staff lunch this Friday.It was one 'bad' experience. \u00a0From the staff being extremely busy on a Friday lunchtime, to just really terrible food, it wasn't pleasant. \u00a0I'd ordered the wrap with spinach and halloumi cheese, and I'm sorry to say, it tasted terrible. \u00a0The cheese was all clumped into one end of the wrap, whilst the falafel, spinach and roasted tomatoes were loosely on the other half, and eating it, either you got a mouthful of just two or three layers of cheese and wrap, or you would have to bite off the spinach, hummus and sundried tomatoes part.. \u00a0The salad that accompanied it was poorly dressed (though I doubt it was dressed at all), and whilst it's great to have uber healthy sprouts on the salad, the lack of seasoning totally spoiled it.The coleslaw was more watery than mayonnaisy, and the wrap appeared to be half soaked or drenched in it's own juices, I'm guessing.Can't say I was terribly impressed with the green smoothie I ordered either, it was ok, but honestly, I've had way better.The waitress that served us seemed to be permanently trying to keep busy, but wasn't taking any time to take care of us, the customers. \u00a0It seems it was more important for her to clear tables off of empty tables, as the lunch hour was finishing, than to take our money and let us leave. \u00a0We ended up making our way to the door, to pay by the entrance, and only then did she seem to take an interest in us.. probably hoping we might tip her for ignoring us, and giving us some terrible food.The only saving grace, at this meal, was the nachos starters. \u00a0With melted cheese, we took the veggie option with refried beans, and it had sour cream, and guacamole, and with that starter we were all just in heaven!! It was amazing and yummi, and next time if I ever dare go there again, I'll be relying on that dish alone to make sure I have something remotely edible and yummy.I'm sure they have better dishes, and their service isn't always 'that' terrible.. but whatever you do, don't order that halloumi panini.. it's like chalk and cheese when you eat it, literally.. :(",

I've been greeted by gracious staff each time I've been in (including the twin sister of one of the servers at the BC-Soho...wtf?) which makes me happy. What makes me happier is that the cook is right there for everybody to see and that the smoke from his efforts make his area smell like bacon. I love my bacon and this place delivers the goods. The menu is far larger than the Soho location and I plan on trying everything on it eventually. They also don't shy away from giving you all the food you could possibly want; so there's a high probability that a heart attack will get in the way of accomplishing all of my goals.Sure \"Mei L.\" (if that IS your real name) loved the bathrooms, but I was taken by the Disco anteroom - painted black with a innocently spinning mirror ball hanging from the ceiling. Disco party! I'll bring the illicit substances if you bring a lack of inhibition...and bacon.",

Or the smoked salmon version which was tasty too and ingredients were super fresh. Great coffee and juices concoctions too, and not super expensive. I could find an excuse to go every Sunday, I think. Also remember to get your bacon streaky (is there really any other way??)Atmosphere is funky and cool, of course aided by the tiny bathroom disco, which was a little strange, but hilarious. The only downside is the service is pretty slow and slightly inattentive, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. Also, to avoid waiting an hour to eat you should come before 10:30, especially on Sundays.",

Putting aside the world food shortages (which probably coincide with the expansion of this mini chain) the food is good but large. \u00a0This was an English breakfast with a proper sausage, quality bacon, luxuriant black pudding, and all the rest. \u00a0Much better than equivalents I regularly have at the Wolseley, Roast etc..The decor is a bit like a new version of TGI Fridays but then TGI Fridays was once cool wasn't it?",

With \u00a39 burritos and a less than inspired menu. if you are looking for a proper breakfast then head to The Diner around the corner, or any of the other venues in Shoreditch offering up the best kind of English Breakfast.

So props to them for making the place look welcoming.They do rather standard food, nothing that I find exciting on the menu. Tea, toast, coffee, and the jerk chicken all get good marks. Portions are very large (but I don't actually think that's a good thing, or at least it doesn't contribute to stars). Prices are ok. There are caffs where you could get a decent breakfast for half the price nearby, but those caffs don't have such a lovely interior and they shut at 3pm.This is definitely a place that makes me want to hang out a while, and since it's never totally packed, that's easy to do.",

I decided on the All American breakfast because I felt that was a safe choice. The All American comes with bacon, pancakes, eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Everything was really good BUT the pancakes. Yikes! They were so flavorless and mushy tasting. The tasty syrup couldn't even save them. I finished them because I don't like leaving food on my plate. I'm still giving this place four stars cause the service was good and everything else besides the pancakes tasted nice. However, it's not hard to mess up bacon, eggs, sausage, and potatoes and I thought pancakes too! But I was wrong. I would still come back here if I'm in London again but will try something else.",

The service can be a bit manic - but as long as there's a pint sized Bloody and a Ham so Eggsited in front of me in front of me in a reasonable amount of time, I'm happy as a clam.",

    "text": "And so I find myself at the Breakfast Club, Shoreditch again. It's our default breakfast meeting place when we can't think of anything new. I guess that's because it's mostly reliably good. This morning I'm having the huevos rancheros, which are as good as I've had in London. My other regular choices are the avocado with poach eggs, bacon and chilli and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, which are also pretty consistent. I used to go for the full breakfast, but found it a little dull in comparison. My colleagues enjoy the bircher muesli, but I've never tried it.The service here can be a bit erratic, as they seem to value hiring staff based on how hipster they are instead of how good they are at waiting tables, but it's usually good enough.We normally come weekday early morning, and so never have to queue to get in, but I'd imagine this is a different story for weekend brunch, if the queue at the Islington branch is anything to go by.",

Suddenly you get red pancakes with egg and bacon stacked high. And challenges that accompany that. Like finishing 20 pieces of pancake to get your meal free. Christmas is even better with Christmas Sandwiches and Full Dinners in the Breakfast club style, which is oft. More Bacon makes a Better Meal.Once you've discovered this place, it's the place you'll feel like you're cheating on whenever you go elsewhere.",

Judging by the speed and efficiency of the Spitalfield branch, I'd calculated that I should be able to have a lovely quick lunch and be back at the office within an hour. I couldn't be more wrong! Even though the place was only full slightly above half, we waited 45 minutes for our burgers. But it was worth waiting for! The smoked fish burger was melting in my mouth. It was full of flavours, moist and nicely complemented with coriander and mango.I liked the atmosphere and the d\u00e9cor too. And the fact that if has so many different sections. So you can a little bit industrial front, dinery corner on the right and another hidden corner at the back for more romantic dinners.I've seen lost of people ordering poached eggs with avocado and salmon. Need to come back to try it too!",

Great latte in a huge cup. Perfect!Really neat decorations in this place. First, there aren't any two tables that match. And the chairs are a weird combination of just about everything possible Completely randomized. Stuff on the wall is like that \"vintage\" decor you find in some American theme restaurants, but this stuff seems like it's real and not fake.Wi-fi is protected, but I found the password was \"gettingjiggywithit\".Note that the place gets very very busy as the morning progresses.

My favourite dishes are: -eggs on toast with 3 tomato jam-pancakes with berries (don't order if you don't like sweet, but I love this. It is basically a short stack of pancakes with a huge plop of vanilla whipped cream, berries, and maple syrup on the side.

It was lovely though as the staff kept coming out to apologise to the queue and provide little complimentary hot drinks of mint or ginger for us cold folk!Once inside, we were overwhelmed with breakfast choice. You can actually see into the kitchen and the chefs hard at work and I was amazed at the quality and quantity of food appearing - huge portions presented really well! Of course not in a fancy presentation but rather food piled high, looking delicious and crying out to be eaten!We went for a pitcher of orange juice between us (fresh orange juice, arrived a shiny metal pitcher with lots of ice) which worked out an amazing deal, I think we managed to have 3 or 4 glasses each from this - in fact we even had some left over which we gifted to the people sat next to us so they got some free orange juice and the staff even brought them over glasses with ice to enjoy the juice, no complaints from the staff!The food was as good as it looked, absolutely perfect. I have attached photographs as well so please do check them out! The staff were lovely and polite, people were not rushed out and there were even board games being played over breakfasts. Really want to go back here.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is simply the wait to get seated, or in the cold time we visited, the wait to get INSIDE. I don't know how it'd be possible to fix this as it was pretty packed of seats but if you are in a rush this isn't the place for you. But do make time to come and enjoy breakfast here, whatever time of day!As a warning too, Wi-Fi is FREE but not in use at the weekend.",

Warning about this side room - the most comfortable looking chair may turn out to be something you feel you will be trapped and tortured in forever. Go round to the far side.Drinks a bit slow both with ordering and subsequent arrival but the food came fairly swiftly and made everyone very happy. I tried both cow & pig burger and the beef chilli cheese (SPLITTING obviously, I am not a total pie) and overall preferred the latter although basically loved both. My friend got buffalo wings which are technically a starter but the portion is massive, and also delicious, so I finished them (oh wait, I am a total pie). I want to go back so I can try the burrito, and/or the mac & cheese options.NB this is not an everyday office lunch place - main with a drink will be over \u00a310.",

I'd never que in the weekend morning rush, but we often find ourselves here for lunch, midweek breakfast, early dinners, coffee with friends, etc. We come often. We tip. We are polite. We spend a lot of money because I really like breakfast stuff. Usually the service is pretty good (I actually can't remember a time it wasn't) -- but last night (Sunday the 26th October) our service was perfunctory at best, bordering on super rude. I still don't actually know why. We brought our 8 month old to eat with us (it was 530pm on a Sunday). We didn't bring a huge buggy, he sat in my lap. He was not allowed to play with anything on the table. We did not order him specific off menu things to eat. He likes the loud 80's/90's music. All in all, it was barely as if he was there -- but my feeling was that the bad service was because of him, or that this chick really just has an axe to grind with life. Either way -- I'm not a fan of that BS. Get a grip or get a job outside of the service industry. We finally just had to get up and walk to the counter to get the bill and leave (the restaurant was about quarter to half full). Right from the time we started ordering we felt like we were a bother and almost defensively had to answer questions. Really weird. Super disappointing in a place where we've come many, many times over the years f or a good meal since we've lived near Hoxton Square. The food is fine, but not good enough to mask bad service. It'll be a long while before I return, if ever.",

I didn't really have much voice after the madness of karaoke and drinking the previous evening...but this breakfast made me sufficiently full of energy to make it home to my kitten, fianc\u00e9e and recovery cuddles. Phew.I like:- The d\u00e9cor and ambience - the loo wallpaper is awesome!- My yummy eggs with chorizo (I have no idea what it was called, but it made me happy)- Tea in smiling mugs- One of the waiters took a photo of us all...he turned the camera around and took a photo with himself in...plus another waitress ran across the room to photo-bomb it. I approve of slightly-crazy, friendly staff.I didn't like:- My first tea came in a mug with lipstick mark (I wasn't wearing lipstick so it was obviously not washed- *gross*!) - The line as we left was huuuge. So yay! I like this place, and I'd come back if I am ever in the area early...but I don't think I like it enough to queue if I arrive later in the day.",

    "text": "I went in for a late lunch on my own. Having been uninspired by the breakfast at another branch, I decided to plump for lunch-style food.I was seated quickly (the restaurant was pretty empty at 3pm on a weekday) and my order was taken promptly. I went for a pulled chicken sandwich, poutine, and a coke.My food came pretty quickly and looked good but, eww, it was not. The chicken sandwich was tasty for the first few bites, until I bit into a hunk of what I think was bone - put me right off. The chips? Crunchy and tasty with nice gravy and then WTF IS THIS ABOMINATION OF CHEESE? I thought at first it was mozzarella pearls but upon tasting, it was some kind of goats cheese. It just made no sense and was not what I was expecting.Then the service went downhill. I waited 10 minutes with dirty dishes and no service - and I just wanted to leave, to be honest. Even though my plates were about 90% full, there was no query about my food and as it was only about \u00a311, I just paid and left.Oh, and ETA - I see from the previous review that they ran out of orange juice. They were out today, too. Odd....",

Look at the pictures to see yourself! The picture I took shows a \"Full Monthy\" plate, which is also available in a smaller version (i.e. with less ingredients) that is called \"The Half Monthy\". The plate is very rich and it's really worth a shot. Price is 10.5 for the full version and 8.5\u00a3 for the \"half\" version, which is not \"half\" a plate but just a less challenging one.They have juices in their menu just as it should be for a brunch. Unfortunately they ran out of orange juice and we had to take a smoothie, but it was good too. Since it took a bit to have it served, the restaurant offered the whole pitcher for free. This is a great service!In a few words, the price was good, the service great, the restaurant nicely decorated.I would totally recommend this place for a brunch.",

Let me reiterate that this isn't a preference but a health issue as I am allergic (trust me, as a native Californian, I know how unfortunate that is). As I didn't have time to go back and exchange the meal and wait another 10+ minutes for scrambled eggs to be tossed in a tortilla - I had to forego lunch today after two bites. Willing to give it another go, but not unless they learn how to take notes in the POS system or make sure someone reads them / quality control. Maybe I'll go for a pancake or something less complicated.",

First time I went, was in a group, and don't remember the food taking too long to come. I ordered the club sandwich which had chicken, which was not a disappointment at all! I also ordered the green smoothie but felt the mint was too powerful in it although it did leave me with fresh breath!Second visit,God suggested \u00a0I try the Buttermilk fried chicken with chips...I was about to until my mum picked it and because we did not want to eat the same thing I let her have it. So I picked the Big Bad Burrito with the choice of pork. It was big and bad but was not as great as the Buttermilk fried chicken that I got a taste of which was devinnnneeee!!! \u00a0I also ordered the Mango Go smoothie which had mango,strawberry and apple. To my disappointment it did not look and taste like a mango it looked more strawberry and tasted like a strawberry with sharp apple taste.To finish off we managed to squeeze in a pancakes with berries, maple syrup and vanilla cream. Again pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious with the extra accessories.I like Breakfast Club vibe, and their playlist! The service was great on both occasions and did not have to wait too long for our food. I'm not always in this side of town, but when I come here next I will try what they are known for....Breakfast!",

    "text": "I don't know where to start with this review as I hate to write a bad one! Unfortunately, my most recent visit to The Breakfast Club in Hoxton was a disaster. It was a quiet Sunday night and their card machine was broken, announced a sign on their door. Absolutely not their fault and easily overcome with a quick trip to the cash machine. I imagine at least partly due to this there was only one couple dining when we arrived, in the whole of the usually jam packed restaurant! Despite this, staff were pretty slow to move and greet us. That kind of set the standard. The food order was taken without hiccup & my small human was going to share the hummus and halloumi wrap, original poutine and the short rib & goats cheese topped fries with me. When the food arrived after a 25+ minute wait (we were the only table in there at this point!) I was so sure they'd got my order wrong I actually complained to the waitress. The short rib & goat cheese fries contained zero visible goats cheese whereas the poutine was covered in it. I see now from other reviews that actually, for some reason, that's just how they choose to ruin their poutine! The chips were topped with what I'd have sworn was the goats cheese and should have been on the rib topped fries. The super soft, tangy cheese under the gravy just didn't work in the slightest and I was unable to eat them. The rib fries were good but would have been complimented with some crumbled goats cheese on top. The waitress assured me it was mixed in with the meat but the BBQ sauce entirely overpowered it if that were the case. The wrap was tasty but the halloumi hadn't been grilled enough for my tastes. The wrap basically gets the second star, as it certainly wasn't the service or any of the other food! While there a couple arrived to be seated and neither of the two waitresses or the barman moved to seat them. They were sat on their phones or laptop the entire time and told the customers to pick up their own menus and choose a table while they sat motionless at the bar, hardly a warm welcoming service! I'll not return again, two bad experiences on my last two visits to the place. Disappointing.",

I did not know what to choose so I opted for one of my favourite breakfast dishes: Eggs Benedict. Yummi x100! The sauce was AMAZING and the little muffins underneath so fluffy and delicious. We ordered home-fries on the side (of course). We also got pancakes and Homemade yogurt with fruit and mint (really refreshing). We needed a healthier option after all these comfort food. The pancakes were to-die-for; with some kind of Vanilla cream on top.The coffees were really good as well, specially Cappuccino. Can't wait to come back again!",

Time by only forcing you to read a few words instead of my usual long-winded reviews.The ambiance was awesome, our server was really great... although it was my first proper English girl, so I am assuming I was simply smitten by the accent. However, she was great. Wish I could remember her name.First and last traditional English breakfast. Not good. Don't get it, but I know that I had to do it at least once. No redeeming quality of this breakfast (this is more a comment on all places that serve this and less on the Breakfast Club). Don't get it... keep it England it is all yours.THE VERDICT:We waited in line for this place and I am assuming it is just a tourist trap because... I did not get it because anywhere that serves English food isn't the best. However, ambiance was cool and servers were cool so... if that is worth like 20 american dollars to you... well, go for it. Otherwise... pass. (a 1-star bump for exceptional service).",

Their oatmilk porridge was great - ask for extra oatmilk2. Their gluten free pancakes are ok (heavy/slightly tough) but topped with tasty fruits3. Their side of bacon and sausage are big portions. Should have chosen just the bacon since we couldn't finish4. The side avocado comes out as really cold guacamole. For breakfast it was not what we wanted. But would go great with lunch foods 5. I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. I drink it black so it tasted almost citrusy. Turned it around by adding in the extra oatmilk we had :)6. Staff and greeter chef guy were super nice.Would come here again. PS. Grab a pin before you leave!",

    "text": "What a lovely place to be! I found this restaurant before coming to London, in case the hotel I'm staying doesn't provide the best breakfast. I need a good breakfast to pump up my energy and keep me up. Since they open at 8 AM, I came here a little bit before 8 to look at the place. I was greeted by Lauren, a nice lovely host and waitress. I was seated by the window overlooking the street. Nothing's going on outside the street at this hour. I ordered coffee, of course. She brought me coffee with a very CUTE cup! Woohoo! Loved this cup and of course I forgot to purchase it. Good thing she's very knowledgeable about their menu. When I tried to order a plate that seems offer avocado, which I like, she explained to me about the portion and what else comes with the dish. She's right to recommend me another breakfast plate that also comes with avocado and poached eggs. Since I told her that I could be allergic to some seeds, my breakfast came with a regular white bread. It's better to be safe than sorry during my travel. I got my breakfast with sunflower seeds on the side, which was safe for me to eat. The breakfast is a must-have dish! Btw, the coffee was amazing! Nice rich coffee, I loved it! Try this and you won't be disappointed. I am so pleased with Lauren's best treatment. She took great care of me. I thought it's because I was the first customer that morning but she said \"it's nice to have a nice warm customer to start a day!\" (something like that). It made me cry! I thought she's nice from the beginning and didn't realize she was thinking the same thing about me. In this city, not only that I won't go hungry, but I wasn't abandoned and ignored! The restaurant is pretty big for a breakfast place, could probably accommodate up to 30 people maybe? Very colorful place, which is perfect for my personality and what I enjoy. Life is colorful! Embrace it! I actually came back later that afternoon to try and purchase their t-shirt for Hubby because I liked the wordings. Unfortunately they ran out of his size. Too bad I don't wear t-shirts. Highly recommended place to enjoy your breakfast! Thanks to Lauren for her brilliant recommendation and her persona. Thanks the Club for adding more smiles on my face! *:)",

On the Friday night I was in their new little \"cubbyhouse\" section drink a great selection of gin cocktails (during happy hour they're \u00a35! - happy house is from 5pm - 7pm) along with a big bowel of fries. The Breakfast Club is definitely not a place for a quiet night. It's always busy, loud and happening. So don't have a business meeting here, instead bring friends and dates.",

It was enjoyable and a good approximation for the diner food back in the States. The restaurant itself has a cool, kitschy decor and atmosphere. Laid back, but not trashy. The staff was friendly. If I were a local, I'd probably come here pretty often. It seems like a good place for casual meals with friends. It's also located in a good spot with easy access to a variety of bars and cafes.

The chicken was a little overcooked and the meat was a little dry and the chicken was bland borrowing Flavours from the batter.

Even on a Friday they have a happy hour 5-7 - all cocktails \u00a35 and they are yuuuum cocktails! They aren't your bog standard mojito or Cosmo. Full of flavours, something a bit different but are just served in normal cocktail glasses with no extravagance or quirky extras like you see in LCC or Experimental Cocktail Club.Unfortunately they had run out of the short rib and goats cheese fries but the chilli fries were a good replacement - plenty of chilli but perhaps not cheesy enough for me. The main however was the real icing on the cake - waffles with fried chicken, gravy and maple syrup. It was sooo good - chicken good, waffle lovely and soft, gravy thick and well flavoured. I cannot recommend this dish enough. There was also plenty of other choices on the menu if this isn't your thing. One a month they also have live music (which I don't think they advertise on their website - shame) which starts at about 8 on their small stage in the far side of the restaurant. Such a nice idea and great for a little dance after some food and with your drink!",

Also, if you want to customize your meal (this instead of that, more sausage and no bacon, etc) they are more than happy to accommodate even the most pickey pallet! Deco is simple, like London's version of the diner. A must if you are in the neighborhood. There is sometimes a wait, but it's worth it!!",

    "text": "I moved to the Shoreditch area about a month or so ago, and there had been a lot of hype over 'The Breakfast Club'. Seriously, a lot of hype. So I don't know whether I had my expectations set too high, but I was seriously not impressed. For \u00a310, I had bland scrambled eggs with no texture whatsoever; a really disgusting vegetarian sausage (apparently the pork sausage, which I don't eat, was just as bad); dodgy looking and tasting mushrooms; and decent beans. I really do wish I went to the little cafe around the corner and had a nice little fry up for about \u00a34. Also, if you want to go to The Breakfast Club, do NOT go on a Sunday morning. You will find yourself waiting for at least half an hour if not more. However, I have to be completely honest here- I should have gone for the pancakes. I had serious table/menu envy (not too sure what it's called) when i saw the 4 big pancakes being delivered to the next table. In that respect, I am actually going to go back to The Breakfast Club to try them out and let you know what I think!",

I was pretty disappointed with what I got!There was a short queue on a Sunday morning, staff were friendly and it moved pretty quickly so can't complain about that.We ordered a variety of breakfasts, one having pancakes, another veggie burrito and I went for sausage and egg sandwich. I love chorizo so the idea of a chorizo in a butty excited me, but it wasn't great quality and even the egg was pretty over cooked! The veggie burrito was pretty tasteless. Pancakes were good, but from what I've heard they are meant to be the best pancakes in london and they are definitely not!One very positive thing to say is that the staff are super helpful.",

Came on a bank holiday, pre-brunch hours, so there was no waiting which was nice. \u00a0I ordered something healthy with a side of bacon. Of course. The healthy was poached eggs atop mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and parmesan shavings. yum. Alas, the bacon was not real american style bacon. IT DIDNT CLAIM TO BE. But my food order was based entirely on what they served the guy next to me and the bacon looked like the genuine article from 3 feet away. The only con so far is that they seated us on this weird long picnic bench with another couple next to us and the guy kept shifting around which made for an interesting carnival style ride while waiting for my food. Not fun once I was trying to enjoy eating said food though.",

It has the BEST breakfast food I have ever had. I am pretty sure I went to it at least 10+ times. I brought family and friends and everyone loved it. Their eggs benedict and French toast with bananas and bacon are to die for. Not only does the food come out beautifully but the decor inside is amazing. Every chair is different, the decorations have a diner feel but an urban look. I absolutely love The Breakfast Club and if you are in London and do not go to it, that is a shame.",

I really enjoyed my Bacon and Banana french toast, though i was a little disappointed when it came out and the strips of bacon were sitting on top of the french toast and not inside of it, as I had thought. (I know what some of you may be thinking - bacon INSIDE french toast?? Trust me - it exists and it's gooohd.) Huevos Rancheros - whatevs. I'll be returning to this place soon to try all the other goodies :)",

There's usually a wait on the weekend, so either get there early or bring a book (or, better yet, an interesting friend).

We got there at noon and there was a fairly substantial queue, but that didn't dissuade us as I always figure, if there's a line, then they're doing something right. We wait maybe a half hour and get in, the the decor was very homey and lived in. For someone who is used to eating in more grand places, this probably wouldn't be for you. I found the decor really charming and fun. Once inside we really didn't have to wait long to order or for our food to arrive, it seemed we had just ordered 5 minutes before and they were already out. I got the huevos rancheros without the chorizo (as I'm vegetarian although I bet the refried beans were fried in animal fat, oh well), and that was quite nice. The portion was pretty much perfect for me, and I guess you could say I have an average-above average appetite. The refried beans were much better than most I've had before, and the guacamole was also quite good. It was a proper messy dish, which is exactly how I like my Hispanic food :D I'd 100% go there again, next time with a bigger crowd, as it has such a friendly atmosphere and its the sort of place I just want to share with everyone else.",

I wouldn't mind the queue, but this is London, not New York or Berlin, so the food inside was of course obvious and uninspired and completely unworthy of waiting outside. Bacon this. Fried egg that. It would be good to go somewhere so obviously cool like this and see a bit of ingenuity, but, in typical London fashion, only the bare minimum and the least amount of effort is provided. Not worth the money as the food would have been exactly the same in my local greasy spoon. My veggie breakfast was bland, the veggie sausages were dry and almost flavourless. It says you get mushrooms. You get one mushroom, withered and sad with no seasoning. A tiny pot of beans. If you happen to be vegan, you are screwed. Utterly boring and tedious.

We waited the line for about 15 minutes before a table came up and are super happy that we didn't give up and go elsewhere. \u00a0We had our New Year's day brunch her (at, ahem, 3pm) & it was absolutely perfect. A casual, comfortable spot but the food was what really hit it out of the park. I chose eggs benedict while my partner enjoyed huevos rancheros (and we split sides of fruit and home fries). Everything was fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented. The coffee is quite amazing as well!If you can't tell - I highly recommend!",

I ordered the poached egg with avocado & chilies which would earn the extra star if I hadn't been wishing the extra handful of avocado hadn't been another egg. Avocado is fantastic except when served in a heaping mess as the main event.Yes, it's pricey and just a once-in-awhile sort of thing. The Full Monty that my boyfriend had looked amazing but left him feeling like quite the Fully Monty. sidenote: The bacon is better in this country.",

The pancakes are not American style, not sure what kind but they were delicious and filling. The batter seems to be a lot thicker. It comes with the most incredible tasting bacon!!! The Full Monty is sure to fill you up. The bacon included here is a bit different- damn I would go back everyday just for the BACONNNNN!!!!! The interior is cute and the waiters are very friendly and helpful, although service was a bit slow. Will \u00a0definitely go back and try some other things on the menu.",

    "text": "Having been a place I've wanted to try for God knows how long, but either a too long queue or just plans not going ahead, it is only recently I have experienced The Breakfast Club. I've decided to review my fave location out of the three I've been to. The portions at each location seem to vary. I am basing this on the portions for the pancakes and berries. This place and the Artillery Lane serve 4, where as the Soho branch serves 3. So the pancakes. I have to say they are my favourite pancakes in London. For something so simple they got it right. \u00a0I usually just use the buttermilk pancake mix from Costco to make my American style pancakes, but I will gladly part money when the pancakes are this good. The only complaint is that they don't use Aunt Jemima's syrup (which is my FAVE and only syrup I like to use at home), but I know that is an absurd request, therefore an invalid complaint, I am just picky. I also (because I eat way too much) ordered the Huevos Ranchero. The chorizo sausages they use are hella tasty as well as the beans served with it. Usually Mexican food in the UK is a huge let down for me. But this hit the mark of being exceptional. I then became obsessed with making my own variations at home. I've been the The Breakfast Club 3 times in 3 weeks. Had pancakes each time. It's the place I know think of when I think where to go for a bite to eat.",

    "text": "This just-South-of-Hoxton Square branch of the popular Soho breakfast spot/sandwich joint/free WiFi paradise opened last Wednesday and it's about to be my new favorite place in London. \u00a0That is, as soon as they get the free WiFi installed next week. Unlike the Soho outpost, which is adorable but smaller than than my ex-boyfriends...closet, this Breakfast Club is spacious, sunny, and oh so happily decorated. There are comfy leather couches, worn benches, picnic tables, kitschy wall decorations, enamel buckets full of condiments, surfboards, colorful lettering, and assorted antique-y chairs of all kinds. Most importantly, \u00a0the bathrooms fill me with an overflowing abundance of joy that bubbles out of my pores and stretches a smile across my face. You walk into the 'Bathrooms and World's Smallest Disco' to a revolving disco ball and four different stalls independently wallpapered with memories of my childhood. He-Man and Masters of the Universe. Ghostbusters. Fraggle Rock. Strawberry Shortcake. This place makes me feel like a five-year-old-dancing with adorable little monsters to the Fraggle Rock theme song. Besides the toilets, the food is AWESOME (that's a bad switch in topics in one sentence). An excellent flat white, creamy and strong and perfect for an unnecessarily early morning. A delicious bacon bap/butty/bit of perfection is a soft white roll generously swabbed with butter and stuffed full of salty savory stupendous streaky bacon. My companion's BLT was another bite of blissfulness. Plus the people working there were incredibly friendly and chatty and about to be our new best friends when we show up there every day for free WiFi and our daily dose of bacon.",
