Parents and me wanted lobster noodles with XO sauce and that was available upon request (it was so good even that filled up, cleaned the plate) The experience was amazing even before we entered the big black door, greeted by the front desk and was taken to our table. It looks like the hire in this place has \"professional\" requirements, you'll understand what I mean when you get there. \u00a0If I'm in London again, it'll be my first stop!",

    "text": "Best dim sum in London! Yes, quite a claim but I've tried quite a few and this is as good as it gets. The restaurant is split into two sections, upstairs which has windows and lighter interior and the downstairs area which is like the other Hakkasan in Hanway Place. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, there wasn't any unnecessary wait at any point. Now to the dim sum. The Hakkasan main dishes can be quite pricey but I find that the dim sum is actually not too bad compared to other places. Considering the quality of the dim sum I'd happily pay the price. Well, maybe not every week. Some great ones were the Chinese chives and crabmeat steamed dumplings, little bundles of deliciousness. Very subtle flavours.The smoked duck and pumpkin dumplings were actually shaped into little mini pumpkins. The pumpkin and duck went really well together and being a fried dumpling the outside was perfectly crispy.The prawn and kai lan cheong fun had the best flavour I've encountered so far in London.Had a few more dim sum but these were the highlights. The Xiao Long Bao were good as well but a bit small. In addition to the dim sum a main dish was required and aubergine and tofu in black bean sauce hotpot was chosen. It turned out to be a great choice. The tofu was perfectly soft and the flavour was great.",

My fellow diners and I followed the \u00a350 set menu.The starter of dim sum was excellent (great variety), and the waitress helpfully lead us slowly through what was in each one, meaning I didn't end up sucking on a scallop by mistake!The standout main was the beef. Now I can't remember what this was called, but it came in an edible 'cone' and was meltingly tender and cooked in a gorgeous, sweet, rich sauce. The king prawns were also excellent, and huge.I think I was too deleriously full to remember the pudding, but there was chocolate involved.A really, really beautiful restaurant, with great, attentive staff, wonderful food, and everything else you would expect for this price bracket.",

The cod with Chinese honey was good if a little heavier than expected. The aubergines and tofu claypot was one of my favorites. Mapo tofu is not so Sichuan, more of a Western version with a more black bean than Sichuan pepper spice. I liked the spicy shrimp but not because it was spicy. \u00a0Desserts were good not great.The sticker shock brought the stars down...

I suppose when you have a one Michelin star, you don't really need to advertise much.The atmosphere in this place was very romantic, dim and warm. I knew immediately upon absorbing the decor that this was an elegant fine dining establishment. The staff members of this restaurant were very well trained. They were friendly, warm, welcoming and quite knowledgeable about the menu items. They made me feel like a valued patron of their establishment and it was very nice.The food and drinks we ordered were served in a timely manner and without a doubt, quite delicious. While I recognize the basics of each dim sum dish, every item was \"kicked up a notch\". These were no traditional dim sum dishes, but more of a nuevo version. \u00a0Don't come here to expect the Hong Kong cart service dim sum experience. Instead, be ready for a totally new dining experience. If you've never visited Hakkasan, I do highly recommend trying this place at least once for a Sunday brunch and return for a dinner service if you like it.",

I would never think of dim sum the same again. My friend loved the scallop and caviar dim sum - I thought it was good - but not as good as duck ones.For mains we had king prawn with what seemed to be a un-popped corn in sweetish dark sauce - delicious. Venison stir fry was a bit of a disappointment. Honestly, I don't think I'm a fan of red meat unless it comes in a steak and bloody.The rice crispy dessert (praline ball wrapped in milk chocolate and rice crispies) was very good - though I'd thought that putting dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate would have been better and less sweet. I don't like desserts that are too sweet.As for atmosphere - we sat downstairs - with the dimmed lights and background conversations around us. Though with quite a few people around and a birthday lunch nearby - it was still very moderate amount of noise. It was very pleasant.Service - very good. The waiter forgot to serve us our champagne - so we got it on the house when we asked after our bubbles.For two dim sum starters, two mains and one dessert - we spent \u00a390 overall and left the restaurant feeling full.I would go back for the dim sum alone.",

From the lettuce wraps, to the pork belly, to the black truffle duck. - each dish was cooked to perfection with flavor combinations that I had just never tasted before. This is not one of those 'the ingredients speak for themselves' type of restaurants. I have no doubt that they are using top notch ingredients in their kitchen, but there is a bit of genius to what they are doing back there. I can't say much more then this, but if you're looking for a high end meal for a special night, this is one of the truly amazing restaurants I've been to.",

The restaurant is located in a weird alley away from the busy streets of London and it was a bit difficult walking there. Hakkasan is located in a basement, and while going down in the dark, but smartly lit, restaurant you instantly see how fancy everything is. It surely something that you will have to see for yourself.All the waiters/waitresses were all dressed up neatly and acted very professional. We had a wonderful waiter that helped us throughout the whole meal which was great.Last but not least, the food was really good and I would recommend trying their asian fusion dumplings. For desert I had some port wine, that was recommended by the waiter, which went perfect with a set of truffles. The whole experience was excellent, I would definitely visit Hakkasan again.",

    "text": "I used to really like Yauatcha and thought it was one of the few restaurants that managed to execute authentic cantonese dim sum in London. \u00a0Naturally I am curious about its more famous sister restaurant and finally went there for lunch with a friend. \u00a0FOOD:Every dish was well executed. We ordered a few dishes to share: dim sum platter, lamb salad, mui choi (pickled vegetables) & char siu (bbq pork) cheung fun, crispy prawn and shrimp roe with noodles \u00a0and the banana caramel souffle. \u00a0We liked everything - the dim sum were authentic and I really enjoyed the lamb salad, which uses pickled chinese vegetables and I thought that was quite innovative. Overall, very satisfied with the quality of the food.SERVICE: When it comes to service, I have high expectations considering the price point and the fact that the restaurant has been awarded Michelin stars. \u00a0To be fair, everything was great until we were served the wrong dish. \u00a0I ordered the crispy prawn and shrimp roe with noodles but our waitress had mistakenly thought we were ordering the crispy prawn (no noodles). \u00a0When we told her about the mistake, her response was simply that there was no such dish. \u00a0Eventually I had to flip open the menu, turn to the relevant page and point the dish out to her. \u00a0She did serve us the correct dish but we both felt that she was giving us an attitude from that point onwards. Perhaps she was just having a bad day. \u00a0To be fair, everyone else was friendly, attentive and helpful but it did leave me wondering if sub par service was a common theme across Hakkasan and Yauatcha.",

(further disclaimer, I only found out about this place on the second night). Its so funny too, how to get to one of the locations you go through this small, narrow cobblestoney street. \u00a0So small in fact the taxi prefers to let you out a few roads over. \u00a0And then you open the door to modern, and sophisticated. \u00a0 If you stay too long and drink too much its entirely possible you will forget where you are.It is chic...think LA, think Miami, think NY...its dark, huge, trendy and absolutely sexy. \u00a0The food is incredible. \u00a0It looks as good as the people who are dining. \u00a0It is chinese food, and with my lack of chinese reviews we know this is not my go to cuisine...not because I don't like it, but because it does not like me, yet this food I could eat everyday. \u00a0What is even more ridiculous, is that each time we ended up here after having dinner elsewhere but staying up too late we needed second dinner. \u00a0You can't go wrong with the dim sum and you should go with someone who is open to sharing. \u00a0Try any of the cocktails. \u00a0The bar is probably the longest I've ever seen. \u00a0The servers friendly. \u00a0And its packed until 1am. \u00a0Oooh, and the bathroom as really good smelling soap!

The place was a bit depressing with its gloomy interior & its small space but other than that as in -food wise- it was perfect.We had the very well-known duck salad & it was AMAAZING with a very unique sour-sweet taste along with the duck i would give it 10/10.Then we had Sesame Prawn Toast , it was good & the taste was very new & interesting , i would give it 7/10.Then we had also the very recommended-Ribeyes beef -medium cooked- was AMAAZING & just perfect , i would give it 10/10 if you had it with their house noodle.For the drinks we had some non-alcoholic cocktails which were great, in particular the one that has berries & strawberriesFor the dessert we had the so-called famous chocolate bomb, which looked so unbelievably yummy & irresistible from the outside but flavour wise it wasn't much , as the rice crisps had overwhelmed the flavour along with the very dark sweetless chocolate sauce. It was too much for us. I would give it 5/10 -flavour wise- . The waiters were very helpful with very good recommendations, we just hoped we chose what they recommended for dessert. Other than that i would give the whole experience 9/10.Cheers!",

We had so many dishesSome stand out dishes include:Jasmine tea smoked ribs - flesh is sweet, soft and falls off the boneSweet and sour pork - definitely one of the best in LondonMui choi glutinous rice - A very Asian dish. I very much enjoyed the chewiness of the rice.The weaker dishes were actually those that have been \"fancied\" up. A prime example is the roast duck with black truffle. Not nearly as good as plain roast duck you can find in other Cantonese restaurantsin London. You'll find quite a few such dishes I believe were created for customers looking to blow more cash on their meal. A bowl of hot and sour soup for more than \u00a312 is unreasonableThe simple dishes here are done very well, however I dont think I would bother with anything with truffle or caviar when I come back",

Requested table that we were assured was \"reserved for another diner\" when we arrived, and we had a choice between 2 tables upstairs facing service areas, or one in the basement area.

It is undoubtedly expensive, but you are guaranteed to have a lot of fun here whether it's for a special occasion like a birthday/anniversary or a larger group dinner with friends. My girlfriend has chosen this for her birthday two out of the last 3 years. (Sushi Samba wedged in between).Stand out dishes are the Dim Sum platters, the champagne cod, the beef and merlot stir fry. The steamed turbot and chicken satay are also favourites. For dessert, the Jivara bomb is the must try dish. Cocktail wise, the smoky negroni is my staple and they make a great old fashioned.Budget for about \u00a3100-\u00a3125 a head for starters, mains, dessert & wine.",

    "text": "As a Michelin Star restaurant (the ONLY Chinese / Cantonese on Earth as of now), any seasoned dining vet would certainly have high expectations on both food AND service. So in turn, you should anticipate only the best. Right? FOOD: Dim Sum was great. Venison (tender without a game taste), and the lobster rolls ( outer crust resembling frosted mini wheats without the frost) were a hit! As for the rest of the dim sum items, they were flawless ( ie, \u00a0beef brisket in another dish was lean and tender). I was told prior to my arrival at this restaurant, that some of the best restaurants in London are tucked away in random dark discreet alley ways. This is true after this experience ( I've posted some pics of the alley ways and stairs which lead to this posh dining place). Yes, it is a hidden gem.SERVICE:My pet peeve for giving any fine dining establishment a perfect 5 star restaurant comes with exceptional / attentive service. This is essential. I ate during late lunch hours around 2pm, so it was not busy at all. Many surrounding tables were vacant which in turn should allow servers to give full attention to the diners. The only issue I encountered was their attentiveness. For example, overall service was perfect until my glass of water went dry and I was still in the middle of my meal. The restaurant wasn't busy so I expected a prompt refill. Several minutes had passed as I waited... and waited. \u00a0I needed to grab the attention of our waitress. Service and meal must go hand-in-hand. SUMMARY: Definitely a 5 star restaurant but service needed to be more on point.The bar, the cozy bench pillow seating, and hip modern asian flared ambience really set the tone. This restaurant truly deserves a 4 1/2 star rating. However due to yelps rating restrictions of giving whole stars instead of half stars, I would have to rate this place a 4. Definitely check this place out if you get the chance to visit London!",

    "text": "Hakkasan is the kind of place one goes to see and be seen. And it serves its purpose exceptionally well. Sultry lighting, tightly-packed open dining areas, and a location in one of London's meccas for the well-to-do create a conflux of factors that encourage socialite (and wannabe) congregation.Attractive serving girls, (attempted) flair bar tending (isn't free-pouring not the done thing in the UK?), and beautiful copywriting of menu items enhance the vibe. If the conversations of the parties on either side of our table were any indication, this is more often than not a date night destination as well. For you heteros out there, guys take note: between the middle-of-the-road priced girly beverages and the natural aphrodisiacs in the food, your chances of scoring upon bringing a lady friend here may possibly skyrocket.*The \u00a314 dim sum platter was unlike any dim sum I'd ever had before. Posh merely nicks the surface of just how fusion each steamed quasi-dumpling appeared and tasted. I highly recommend the sea bass with Szechuan chillies - just don't expect much heat. Even with a warning from our server about avoiding the spicy peppers, I barely felt a tingle on my tongue. And whilst the sauteed morningglories (cong xing cai) were perfectly ample and tender, you could probably get an equivalent dish at many eateries in Chinatown for a fraction of the cost.All in all, a fine enough experience. I'd just rather have the real thing... at a relative pittance of the expense of Hakkasan.------*Full disclosure: this is not something that's been personally tested. I'm drawing some broad conclusions based on overheard chats and visible body language.",

    "text": "Our lovely friends invited us to Hakkasan to celebrate a birthday. We are vegetarians with strong aversions to mushrooms which is usually an extremely problematic experience when dining non-vegetarian fare. The host of the fete made sure to call and voila! The amazing chef at Hakkasan provided us a menu (via email) of non-mushroom vegetarian options that may be specially made for us with advanced notice. So, before we even got to Hakkasan, we were off to a great start as far as excellent customer service is concerned.PLEASE NOTE BEFORE READING AHEAD:The only *only* reason Hakkasan has not received a 100% perfect, handy-dandy review is because...gasp! Although they are extremely accommodating to vegetarian diners, their veggie-friendly dishes need a lot of work in terms of flavor. Other than that, another minor note: It is very hard to find this place as it has no signage. You have to spot a little red door and a very fancy and important staff member outside with a clipboard deciding who gets in. He or she has the omnipresence and power of Oz, apparently. Just a tidbit for ya'll.Hakkasan is super swanky. We arrived in our finest Friday night attire to be seated in an extremey spacious booth. The decor is unmatched - everything is gorgeous, spotless and the service is so fantastic you're not even allowed to THINK about pouring your water. \u00a0Yes, that's a bonafide fact. They take care of everything for you.We ordered cocktails (lychee martinis, anyone?) and starters. Everything was served quickly. Everything we ordered was masterfully placed into our dishes / bowls and we had the choice of chopstix (or not). Everything we ate was extremely fresh (down to the salmon our friends enjoyed) and we had no complaints. Food came faster than we can eat and our cocktails kept flowing - no problems there. It was an evening to remember with a rather terrifying price tag but all worth it. Not sure I would come there again because of the lack of tasty options but I'd definitely recommend it to meat-loving (or seafood obsessing) diners. It's a beautiful place and everyone should be so lucky as to experience it. Magnifique!",

The notable items were the beef and the squid, everything else was very average or below average. Had the rhubarb margarita which was decent; it was advertised as spicy by our waiter, but it was more sweet than spicy. Had a very bland dirty martini as well.

    "text": "I had high expectations for this restaurant due to the price range and how exclusive they were when I made the reservation. We came here for a corporate dinner. I made reservations ahead of time and I was told that we would need to pre-select a fixed menu for 68 pounds per person for private dining. I agreed and signed an agreement that we will show up or we would be subject to a 20% charge. We get to the restaurant and it is noisy and very crowded. We did NOT get a private dining space, rather we were seated in the basement with the louder crowd. It took them 20 minutes to greet us with water and waited another 20 to get our cocktails. I spoke to the waiter in charge and asked her if we could order things a la carte besides the fixed menu that was given to us, she answered with such a rude tone and told me repeatedly that we had chosen the pre fixed menu and we needed to spend at the minimum of 68 pounds per person. I assured her that we will go well over the minimum and to just take whatever my colleagues ordered. I get back to the table and they start bringing out appetizers (dim sum platters). The dumplings were good and they gave out generous portions for everyone to have enough. However, we were still sitting there waiting for our alcoholic beverages to be served. My colleague finally asked for the manager, and until then did they expedite their service. The pre fixed menu came with a TON of food. I thought we each get to choose from the selection, but they brought out everything from the list and served it family style. It was very filling, some dishes were very oily but for the most part it was good. I would rate this place 3 stars partially because of the food quality but mostly due to their service. It is a very upscale and expensive venue and the experience and service should parallel the profile they ought to maintain. The location is great and is in central London but the staff could be a bit more friendlier and accommodating especially for out of country individuals who look for a great dining experience.",

And, as always with my mega-bookmarks, I had high hopes.First things first, this place is not cheap. It is affordable, but you could literally spend as much as you like (I'm looking at you 'Peking duck with royal beluga caviar'...) We ordered the lowest price set/tasting menu which was around \u00a338 a person for 4 small dim sum, a small main/rice portion and a little dessert each. After adding in an extra couple of starters at \u00a317 a pop, and some plain noodles at \u00a310, it's starting to look pretty pricey. The food was delicious, it must be said. Every bite was great and full of flavour; well seasoned and not at all greasy. None of it blew my mind though. It was 'good' Chinese, probably one of the best, but I'm not sure how they can charge 5x the price of anywhere else for most of the dishes.The atmosphere was a little stifling. The (many many) staff were rather offish and frowny. We walked in all smiles and immediately felt like we were going to be put on the naughty step for being too cheerful. Also, thanks, but I don't need to be followed into the loo, I promise not to steal your Aesop soap.It's obviously a very classy restaurant, with embroidered leather seating, dimmed lighting and black gloss counters. It felt VERY dark though, more like a cocktail bar than a restaurant. Which is where I leave my final thought (Jerry Springer style). Hakkasan does incredible INCREDIBLE cocktails. Amazing. We had three each (at \u00a312.50 a pop), and they were all flawless. I would happily go here just for the drinks. If you're not paying, go here for the food, if you are, just go for the drinks.",

The dim sum platter was tasty and varied, and it was easy for 4 to share (two pieces each of 4 items). If you like somewhat spicy dishes the spicy venison stir fry added an interesting flavor the otherwise standard Asian fare. The black truffle roast duck was simply incredible, and the stir fry lobster in white peppercorn sauce rounded out the meal. The lobster dish was very tasty, but it didn't have enough of a lobster flavor to really mandate a lobster price. You could have told me it was chicken in white peppercorn sauce and I would have believed it. But good. Highly recommend. Solid service, great atmosphere, excellent food.",

    "text": "I visited for a work lunch and was suitably impressed.The prices can be eye-watering. This being a work/client lunch, we'd pre-arranged to have the \u00a3118 set lunch menu. This consisted of lots of delicacy meats including lobster, sea bass and wagyu beef. Suffice to say this was cooked and presented in a sharing manner. Being the most expensive meal I've ever eaten did it deliver? Yes on all counts.The food itself was stunning. It was tasty, well portioned considering the sharing but I could have done with an extra piece of some of the dim sum they served early in the meal. The sea bass was the best dish by group consensus, it was lovely and flaky. Each pieces just melting in your mouth. The duck was a very close second, but didn't surprise like the seabags.Decor just amazing. The place looked the part and service was impeccable too as you'd expect at this high end restaurant. I normally don't like stuffy places but this was anything but. Nice friendly professional staff were attentive and on hand.In all, would I spend this much on my own dime? Most likely not, but about half that is certainly possible given how the set menus scale. The only reason our menu was so expensive were the meats which were all some of the most expensive premium meats in non-typical dishes. E.g. prawns replaced with scollop. Dishes were finished in expensive truffle etc...It's not a place to visit often, but if you're looking to impress then this place is certainly one to have in the address book.",

Their cocktails were great as well, we had the Kowloon cooler, which was wonderful.The server was not the welcoming kind and warned us saying we can only take pictures of ourselves and on food we've ordered. \u00a0She told me that there were restaurant police around to check on people taking unauthorised picture of the restaurant. \u00a0I found it hilarious and stupid.",

    "text": "Been to this branch a few times for dinner, but never for lunch!!Yesterday was my first lunch sitting, booked it last minute in the morning and they were so helpful with the times we could come in for. Booked the table for 1pm, we arrived early, so we sat and ordered drinks. Opted for Taste of Hakkasan Menu \u00a338 plus 1 cocktail and what a bargain, as the A La Carte menu prices will knock you off for 6!!! (Leave the A La Carte for date night ;))I opted for the Lychee Martini as I have had the Hakka a few times (my ultimate fave) but was time for a change, i loved the lychee martini with addition of rose and orange bitter - not too strong and not too sweet! Perfect combination (must try!)They give you 1 option to pick from the vast selection on offer, I opted for the Dim sum selection which consisted of a scallop, white crab and prawn, and crunchy prawn. Because I do not eat venison, they substituted it for a prawn toast. I loved the scallop dumpling, it was my first time trying the shellfish, it was cooked to perfection!!!! Soft and juicy, the crunchy prawn is good too, and the accompanying chilli sauce is fabb!!!! A little kick is needed, the salad on the side is yum too, its slightly bitter and tangy, but goes really well with the dumplings.For mains I went for Spicy Prawn with Lily Bulb and Almonds, mains come with rice and a side dish of asparagus! Before i tucked in, I just looked at how well it was presented, definitely instagram worthy, drooling. Looked amazing, and it certainly did not disappoint!! The flavours of the sauce was ahmayzing, that tang and zing from the limes and lemongrass, the texture of the lily bulb worked well, although I couldn't really see any almonds, but nonetheless the prawns were spicy - but not too much that it would leave you gulping gallons of water. Just the right amount of spice in it, the rice was nice and sticky and the asparagus cooked to perfection, cause you know sometimes it can be overcooked! I loved it all and i cleaned every last bit of sauce and prawns! It is a lot of food for 1, but if you are hungry like me, you will definitely finish it off!! My friends as they are veggies opted for the veggie chicken, which tasted a tad weird, was so rubbery and chewy, like you know when chicken is undercooked. Weird texture too, so all you veggies, I do not recommend this one for you, my friends liked it, but wouldn't order it again and they didn't finish it either!Now the best part of this meal was dessert, as I have had the classic Apple Tatin there, I went for the Jivara Bomb - milk chocolate, hazelnut praline and rice krispies. I know I was a bit shocked to see it covered in rice krispies but it actually works. When the waitress poured the chocolate sauce, it just oozed, there was no breaking it though, I think its one of those \"show desserts\" where nothing happens (boooohoooo hakkasan) there was no theatre!!!! But nonetheless once you manage to break it in half, you have the hazelnut praline parfait inside, hints of popping candy fizzing on your tongue and the tartness of raspberries on your tongue. A very innovative, playful dessert, simple, even though there was no drama, it was definitely tasty and something I'd order again. I love hakkasan, the service is always on point, they do accept last minute reservations for lunch. I love how big the restaurant is, one part is only open for lunch though, the long bar is so beautiful, adorned in red with the entwined HK sign!! Love love love.I highly recommend the lunch set menu, you won't be left disappointed, and definitely filling too!!",

Forget even complaining about the prices, the food was just abominably and completely Bland And Tasteless.The spareribs we were served had been steamed to the texture of over cooked rice before being tossed on the grill for possibly a few moments, and then being drenched in the world's most Bland And Tasteless sauce.The duck stuffed egg rolls contained some Bland And Tasteless pulverized mixture that had clearly just come out of a blender. There truly was no hint of duck whatsoever, by sight or taste.This mixture of \u00a0\"duck\" guck was then wrapped in a very thick pastry, and deep fried long enough to add a quarter pound of grease to the weight of the roll. What's worse than a Bland And Tasteless duck guck egg roll? Try a Bland and Tasteless duck guck egg roll slogged down with a quarter pound of Grease!The Jasmine rice was unimaginably Bland and Tasteless and Overcooked with not a hint of Jasmine flavor. It's a Pure commodity rice from the bottom of the barrel that you would never buy for your home, and you would be better off bringing a container of cooked rice from a Tesco than eating this muck.There was no salt, pepper, soy sauce, hot mustard, chili sauce, duck sauce or any condiment whatsoever on the table (please ANYTHING to relieve the Bland And Tasteless!) and the wait staff seemed too hassled to bring any, not that it would have done any good anyway. Maybe why they don't bother bringing.",

The restaurant is quite big with lovely interiors and an intimate ambience though it can get quite loud. The food was absolutely delicious! Being a fan of Chinese food, I've had many meals at several places across the world but will definitely keep coming back to Hakkasan. There were 3 of us and we ordered the following:- supreme dim sum platter: \u00a0it was very well presented and there was a good balance of flavors. The chicken shumai with caviar was amazing!- Morel mushroom and vegetable spring rolls: tasty but nothing you wouldn't find at a good Chinese restaurant- Stir-fry Peking style duck: this was the best duck I've ever had and until yesterday I wasn't a fan of duck! If you don't eat duck then this might be the place to start at.- Stir-fry back pepper rib eye beef with Merlot: another absolutely delicious dish! - Hakka noodles: a dish most places take for granted but Hakkasan got it right.The cocktails were great as well! Overall an incredibly satisfying meal in every way.",

However, when looking at the menu after booking I learned it is a Michelin star restaurant. The ambiance is great and high class, so dress to impress! The service is great, and our server answered our queries about the food. I am vegetarian So I started with the veggie rumbling platter and it was PHENOMENAL. You get to eat 4 different types of really good dumplings. My main dish was black pepper vegetarian chicken which had a lot of good flavor. I highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance is perfect for a date night.",

When we arrived, it turned out that some of the items were no longer vegan, so my options were a little more limited. This restaurant had a great atmosphere, but I really thought my vegan options were basic and could have been more creative. For three of us, the bill was around $300 USD, which I found excessive especially since I was limited to a basic veg option. I'd only go here again for a company function but would not personally go back.",

    "text": "We're visiting London from LA and have been to the Hakkasan in Beverly Hills before it closed down.I've heard great things about Hakkasan (mostly regarding the Las Vegas location) from other (disclaimer: non-Asian) friends...and while we prefer authentic Cantonese/Taiwanese/Sichuan cuisines, I can appreciate the place for \"Asian fusion\" restaurants...every now and then, I'll even go to PF Changs cos it's easy (less intimidating/scary for friends wanting to stay in the \"safer/what's familiar\" zone of Chinese food) and it's clean and close by to where I'm meeting friends etc...and I know to temper my expectations from the PF Changs' meal ahead of time too.I'm giving this meal 3 instead of 2 stars because I've already been to Hakkasan Beverly Hills and already knew what we were getting into (food and price wise).We have no issues spending much much more on Chinese food (like $1000 USD and up for 2 for fancy Cantonese delicacies like shark's fin soup, bird's nest, abalone, spotted prawns, lobster, Alaskan king crab etc)...I really did want to like Hakkasan Mayfair in London, the decor is modern and very clean (one of my biggest issues with many \"authentic ethnic\" places) but the Supreme Dim Sum platter at \u00a330 with 4 different items, 8 pieces total) tasted so tasteless and bland despite one having black truffle garnish and another with abalone inside...my fianc\u00e9 actually told me he thought they all tasted pretty much the same if he was fed them all blindfolded!The Singaporean vermicelli was pretty tasteless and usually, that should be full of flavor and have some amount of spice to it...it looked the way it should (a bit yellow in color, usually cos of the curry powder/flavor) but completely bland...The soft shell crab small plate was crisp with light batter but we've also had just as good soft shell crabs at just about any other normal/homely Japanese restaurant in LA and even in Washington DC.The best thing was my Coconut Passion Fruit mocktail...def one of the best mocktails I've ever had (and we've had plenty from all levels of Michelin Star restaurants to local mom and pop eats around the world)...but I do tend to love sweet drinks and this was definitely very sweet but fresh and not artificial like many mocktails can be when they use just a mix of syrups and concentrated juice flavoring.I think if you do want an upscale Asian/Chinese but \"safe/with some fusion options\" place, go to Zhengs Chinese in Kensington.At Zhengs, every dish we ordered was tasty and well executed, \u00a0has modern spotlessly clean decor and from the crowd we saw dining there, it definitely has enough dishes to satisfy those wanting more of an Asian fusion taste.Ironically, I don't think I would say we'll never go to another Hakkasan, as there are times where you compromise and just go with the flow.It is definitely a popular enough place (like Nobu--which we do enjoy) that will come up amongst friends suggestions and the food hasn't seen terrible...but at the prices they charge (which is not really the issue for us since I know some people would never like a restaurant no matter how amazing it is just because they can't see any meal being worth over $100 usd or $200 usd per person)...Hakkasan would never be the \"go to\" place for us if it were just my fianc\u00e9 and me selecting a restaurant to eat at...",

We went with wine by the glass so the selection was limited. We ordered the Chardonnay for 15 pounds per glass. Unfortunately, the wine turned out to be grossly overpriced for a cheap bottle of Chardonnay that you can probably get at Tesco for 10 pounds.Oh, guess I should comment on the service. What service? We were attanted by at least 6 different people and, overall, it was not very nice. Especially not when one is reminded 68 min into the dinner that we only have the table for 120 min...so much for choosing this place for an anniversary dinner!We have lived in Hong Kong for 5+ years and know how fine Cantonese/Chinese food is supposed to taste. The Dim Sum at Hakkasan was spot on, but the rest was disappointing.Cannot recommend this restaurant and will not come back. Sorry!",

The only part of the meal where they slipped were the starters which were average to good and not exceptional like the rest of the evening. We were a group of 5 who shared 5 different starters including the Dim Sum and had a 5 main dishes which we also shared a little. The main dishes were exceptional in every way. So was their signature cocktail. Most of them disappeared before we could take pictures :) If money is not an issue I highly recommend this delightful experience. Go with friends, share and enjoy.",

    "text": "This is one of those times where I wish Yelp offered half stars in their rating system. My experience at Hakkasan Mayfair was 3 1/2 stars. Hakkasan is a Michelin rated Chinese restaurant with a dark, intimate vibe. Definitely a dress up and show off your stuff type of place. Upon entering my co-worker and I were immediately greeted and escorted to our table. Even on a Tuesday night the place was packed. Our server came over and took our drink order first. I ordered one of their signature drinks, The Hakka, which had Belvedere vodka, Akashi-Tai sake, lychee, lime, coconut and passion fruit. It was excellent and flavorful but was disappointed to see my glass was only 2/3 full. That has always been a pet peeve of mine. Either use a smaller martini glass or fill it up. \u00a0As for our dinner, most things are appetizer or small plate sized and meant to be shared. We asked for suggestions from our server but he didn't seem to interested and gave us a few quick suggestions. Luckily my co-worker has spent time in the Orient and is more familiar with Asian cuisine. She asked me to trust her judgement in ordering (she did great!). We shared:*Dim Sum Platter - 6 pieces of Dim Sum. scallop shumai, har gau, Chinese chive dumpling, duck and yam bean dumpling. Each type featured 2 pieces each so my co-worker and I were able to try one of each. Very tasty and each one had a unique but equally good flavor and texture.*XO scallops stuffed in zucchini with royal pumpkin sauce. Scallops were fresh but sauce was pretty bland. \u00a0Not overly impressed.*Stir-fry Peking style duck with dried chilli, Szechuan pepper, baby leek and onion. Flavors were excellent. Not overly spicy but the right amount of kick to it. *Hakka noodles with shimeji mushroom, baby leek and salted turnip. Absolutely delicious! Flavors were perfect and amazing.During dinner I ordered a second cocktail and was again disappointed with a 2/3 full martini. I'm a drinker and have no problem spending good money on alcohol but don't skimp your customers. Our server came back and offered a dessert menu but we both declined. We weren't stuffed but satisfied. I'm still not sure what to think about the experience. The food was great even excellent but the wait staff seemed uninterested. The atmosphere at Hakkasan was hip, trendy and beautifully decorated. Seemed a little show offish and snobby though. Not exactly a welcoming atmosphere.",

    "text": "Date of Visit: 26.12.17Time: 6.30pm\"Great food, service and decor. Will never disappoint. \"Review: I have not been to Hakkasan in a while so it was nice to visit again. Bruton Street may not be the busiest of London streets but its proximity to Berkley Sq and both Oxford Street and Regent Street makes it a good location. You are first greeted by the door staff and then down the dark corridor towards the coat check and then through to the reception desk where you are seen by around 5 or more people it seems, all dressed in blue and feels a little intimidating to start as you don't know who to talk to but everyone is friendly and you are soon seen to your table. There is the ground floor and lower ground area. You are served with menus and friendly service from the start. Also all very efficient with all members of staff being attentive and looking out for eye contact. Its nice that each branch have their own signature drinks and food items. The menu has changed since my last visit but we were guided through some options and went with those. Drinks arrived promptly followed by the food which arrived at the right temperature. Food cooked perfectly and the portion size was just right as nothing went to waste. I always like to try a mocktail or two but sometimes it can be difficult to find something that even sounds appetising. Even though the ingredients for the Kumquat Pomme Fizz does not sound like it would work i found it extremely refreshing and happy I went with this. The chicken was cooked well however it could have been a little more spicy and a little more sauce but i still enjoyed it and would order this again. It was also served with some light noodles which were cooked to perfection. The stir fry comes in one large pile so i am not sure how others eat this with chop sticks as it is hard to separate into smaller portions. But you soon get used to it. Again this dish was cooked well but a little too watery at the end but again happy with the recommendations as this also shows the staff know their dishes. \u00a0I went with a vegetarian and plenty of options available, more mushroom and tofu dishes though so do bear this in mind if you are not a fan of either. Dress code: From the website, Smart casual. No sportswear. Jeans are permitted as long as they are worn smartly with shoes and a collared shirt. Smart shorts suitable for lunch service but not dinner. Please do not wear hats inside. However I was only aware of this after my visit and looking at the website. Booking Process: A simple phone call on the day and i was able to make a reservation within 30mins which was perfect as I was round the corner where the wait was around an hour so this worked out well. Location: 17 Bruton Street, London, W1J 6QBParking: Street Parking outside but you are in London so you may need to drive around. Decor & Lighting: The two Hakkasan's i have been to have a similar style and its dark floors, walls and mood lighting all very stylistic. I remember the first time i went to the Mayfair branch it was so dark people had to use their mobiles and turn on the torch just to see the menu and this was during the day! But things have changed with lights over the tables which really help. Ambience & Acoustics: Light background music and easy to talk without the need to raise your voice, so just right, considering the area is mainly hard services they have done a good job to control the acoustics.Drinks: \u00a0Kumquat Pomme Fizz - apple, kumquat, lime and ginger ale. Food: Sanpei chicken claypot with sweet basil, chilli and spring onion & Stir-fry morning glory in chilli, ginger and preserved bean curd sauceBill / Cost: \u00a377.41Conclusion: A really pleasant resturant where the food and service is always good. At around \u00a340 per head without alcohol is fairly reasonable for the quality of food. I would recommend a visit for business, family, or any occasion. Rating: 8.5 out of 10.0",

But mains was another story only the rice and 1 dish arrived, the other dishes were not served until 20 to 25 minutes later despite our requests.

We usually fill up on the \"Small Eats\" but if we're going for more we order the Spicy Prawn and Chicken with satay sauce. The service is excellent, in all our visits, we were never disappointed.",

    "text": "Overall excellent quality food blended with great Cantonese flavours (coming from a Hong Kong Cantonese!). Splendid decor. The dim-sum tasted authentically Chinese, other dishes highly Japanese/Western influenced, finely blended with modern presentation. You will not find the same dishes in a similar top-notch traditional Cantonese restaurant in Hong Kong, e.g. steamed fish, fried tiger prawns, black mushrooms, shark fin soup. Here, you get caviar on peking duck, Wagyu slices, grilled cod fish, and French pastry dessert - all fun and great experience for a Hongkonger. The experience was slightly dampened by the fact that, (1) the Chinese New Year special menu ran out, although we are the first round of customers, on the first CNY day. Most of the other set menus are for 3 people minimum. (2) We were given a time limit for the table, which was not what I expected for a fine dinning experience. I can understand the need of table turnaround and profitability, but given we have spent a good \u00a3170 per head, I would think there should be more flexibility.",

I wouldn't call it goood, just ok.. the chicken tasted like regular chicken I can get at the store with a Tikka masala taste to it... the shrimp tasted more like Thai than Chinese with a coconut milk taste.. The restaurant was really nice but the music sounded like I was at a nightclub.. me and my friends had a hard time chatting cause the music was so loud...",

    "text": "One of the best pork belly preparations I have ever had! It was fantastic with the citrus from the cumquats. The Wagyu rib-eye was the worst preparation I have had. I love the dish when it is done right but this one was like gnawing on a piece of old rubber boot that had been out in the sun too long and then dipped in soy sauce. Best to avoid it. The design of the restaurant was very nice. All of the staff were fantastic except for our server. His dower personality made us feel very unwelcome and like we were a burden on him. He was abrupt in his responses and overall unhelpful. Like he was just going through the motions to get a paycheck. He turned what would have been an otherwise enjoyable meal into an experience I would have rather avoided. As I said above, all of his colleagues were wonderful and attentive however I will not be returning and would not recommend the restaurant due to the server's treatment of our group. 3 stars not 2 only because of the awesome pork belly!",

    "text": "Amazing. One of the best dining experience I've ever had. First off, it is a SCENE. You know, bouncer types with earpieces outside. Inside, lots of pretty people dressed up and eyeing one another while they get f*cked up and eat (or pick at) their overpriced fare. I do enjoy a good scene every now and then, and this one was a hit. The two floors of dark and dimly lit interiors are almost maze-like, but still sexy and inviting. As we waited for our table, our group sipped on Saketinis and another martini with lemongrass. Saketini's were fresh, delicious, not too sweet, and just the right amount of Hendricks. Service was amazing. Food was perfectly timed. Drinks delivered to the right person in the appropriate amount of time. Excellent table maintenance. Whole staff from front desk to management was great. And the food!!! The food was awesome!! It was all a bit small and expensive, but worth it. Along with another person, I was given the privilege of ordering for the table. A sampling of what we got that I would recommend: -Dim Sum platter... about six pieces, three different fillings, all delish. -Soft shell crab... slightly underwhelmed as the one I had at Zuma the previous night was a tad better, but still very good! A bit spicy. -Prawns and foie gras... melts in your mouth! -Roasted Silver Cod... excellent, however the sauce is definitely heavy on the butter and it is quite sweet. Two of us with more delicate stomachs could only have a few bites as it is so rich. -Black truffle duck... Worth moving halfway across the world for. We also had both scallop fried rice and egg fried rice. Scallop was barely noticeable :( so I say stick with egg. We were so stuffed, unfortunately there was no time for dessert. So there you have it. Solid food, served impeccably with a side of scene.",

The waitress than asked to move us twice more, when eventually we gave up paid and left. We complained as we left to the maitre d'.
