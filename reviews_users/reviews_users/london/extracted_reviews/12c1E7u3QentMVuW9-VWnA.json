Both of which were textbook. The muffin halves are both sizeable and tasty. There was a good amount of hand carved Han without it being excessive. The eggs were beautifully golden yolked and perfectly poached. The hollandaise was delicious, being light with a nice note of lemon running through it. I can certainly recommend it here and will definitely visit again when I'm in the area.",

They also have a sweet shop & we got a bunch of them to bring back to The States with us, all of them were very good. I had a spinach, bacon, avocado salad & tortilla chips that came with tzatziki, salsa, & guacamole. My husband had an English breakfast. It was all very good.

There is a very sweet and cozy atmosphere to enjoy a meal or to just stop in for a cup of tea. It's in a bustling area with commuters, but it isn't too loud and makes a perfect spot for people watching! \u00a0The service was kind and efficient and the meals were well portioned and priced. I ordered the vegetarian breakfast, which included two pieces of toast and two poached eggs.

I had the spinach, avocado and bacon salad with a side of sweet potato fries. Salad was tasty, although the avocado and most of the bacon was hiding in the middle so took a bit of mixing to evenly distribute them, but that's only a minor point, it was a good salad. \u00a0Sweet potato fries were tasty, but a little on the limp side. Not gastro cuisine, but a good, homely food that was great on a miserable winter's day",

It almost seemed like they had to think about the request!The sign outside says breakfast-lunch-dinner 24 hours but doesn't mean you can get breakfast 24 hours. Bummer as that's what I was hoping for. They do have a bunch of selections with Halloumi and I love that. Be warned - the Halloumi burger has no burger but was quite good. I'm upping what started as two stars to three. Food was surprisingly better than expected.",

We ordered a couple of cocktails and shared Bill's Sharing Platter, the Sea Bass and Sirloin steak with mushroom sauce. What a satisfying and delicious family style meal we had. We saved room in our bellies of course and got 2 desserts: the Chocolate Dome/Bomb and Sticky Toffee Pudding. Hands down -- the BEST sticky toffee pudding I've ever had. This place is a must try. The ambience was amazing -- lit candles on the tables and quirky furniture. All the staff were also attentive. We have to give a special shout-out to our AWESOME and super friendly server Renata (from Lithuania). Thanks Renata!!! Hope to see you in Canada some time. :)",

If you like to have a larger meal, I would recommend get extra sides. Disappointinly, the waitress didn't really understand the wine list, nor did she send over the bar person to provide insight.

Aperol spiritzs were lovely. Chips were fine and the crumbed calamari was actually quite good with none of that hideous frozen calamari you may find in other places.

The waitress said \"yes\" so I chose the mac& cheese. The food was not bad, but when I got the bill I was charged for the burger& fries plus the mac& cheese. When I asked the manager, he did not even offer as much as a sorry. My bill was 19 pounds (the mac&cheese was 5 pounds), which equated to about $27 US dollars. If i pay $27 for a meal, it better be a steak or some amazing meal. I was very unhappy because it was their fault they gave me the incorrect information and were not apologetic.",
