    "text": "Diwana's lunchtime buffet is the perfect way to write off a Friday afternoon, you'll be sat snoozy and contented at your desk, full of the curry goodness. Or maybe that's just the slacker in me talking... I used to work nearby to Drummond Street, so it was only natural that I tried out a few curry restuarants. I will admit that, in my younger years, I was a little curry mad, think along the lines of the occaisional curry for breakfast and you're getting there (Malaysian style curry, I might add, I liked a little sweetness on a morning). All this previous experience was based on meat curries though, it never really occurred to me that vegetarian options could be anything other than side dishes that enhanced the main course. Diwana's has helped to change my perception, I'm pleased to say. The lunchtime buffet is \u00a36.50, and consists of 3-4 vegetable curries (usually a sweet potato/pumpkin/squash, a saag with paneer, a daal and then a mixed veg curry), rice, chapati, pakora, loads of fresh and nice salads and chutneys/sauces, popadoms and a few other nibbles thrown in. There's also dessert; fresh fruit, coconut cakey stuff, jelly and my favourite, the spiced rice pudding (kheer). It's a fantastic range, really tasty, with real variety. The only unfortunate thing is that I am always wanting to try a bit of it all, leading me to gobble a little too much, hence my writing off the afternoon to snooziness. It's a great place, it does get busy though, but if you're flexible with your time then you'll be fine. Just make sure you have a hammock or something for afterwards.",

Everything is vegetarian, and there are a number of vegan friendly dishes as well. They are unlicenced, but they do have a number of tasty yoghurt based drinks and milkshakes (but again, more sweet). The service is really quick, so it's a perfect lunch time spot. And they are rather nice fellows running the place. Word of caution: while they do take credit cards, they can't take anything with a chip and pin. So bring cash or something a bit more old school.",

This buffet is great. It's \u00a36.75 and you get a selection of great curry stuff and salad, all Indian style. The decor is kind of dated, 70s pine, but this is part of its charm. It's clean. The best thing is that whoever does the cooking (all veggie) really LOVES doing it. You can just tell from the nice way it's laid out and the good ingredients. This place is a gem. There are other places nearby copying it but they're not as good. You don't go there for the style but for the food and the value for money. .",

But our minds were soon made up for us by some passers by who told us we'd love it. Thanks passers by, you weren't wrong! We each opted for Thali meals, which were great value for money and offering several little taster dishes in the traditional south Indian style. Each vegetarian option was packed with flavour and contrasted beautifully, using ingredients including chili, rice and chick peas. A great waiter explained to us how dishes changed daily, meaning you would always be trying something new! There is no alcohol licence, but bring your own is allowed. Diwana is a modestly decorated restaurant, where the food is the undoubted star. Clearly loved by its regulars, the atmosphere was both intimate and vibrant. And I'd cross continents to eat again the eye-rollingly wonderful mango cream dessert we were served!",

    "text": "Due to a confusing set of circumstances involving sickboyedd, beer, a zoo, some bees and Evil Norwich, I found myself in the Euston area on Friday evening with some time to kill. Diwana Bhel Poori House on Drummond Street turned out to be the worst possible place to do this. This was not due to the food, which was fine; or the atmosphere, which was bustling. It was, quite simply, the speediest indian meal I think I have ever had. Within seconds of arriving I had been seated, within minutes I was eating a poppadum and in under half an hour later I was full of veggie curry, getting the bill and leaving. Congratulations to the waiters - they run a restaurant which is faster than Usain Bolt. Judging by the average age of the clientele when I was there, it's popular with students from University College London. This is probably due to the cheap-and-cheerful pricing - Thali platters, featuring a mix of dishes, chapattis, rice and dessert, are 6 or 7 quid. So, they can do curry-in-a-hurry. Any negatives? Well - the menu is simple, the decor's nothing special and the curries, whilst good, aren't exceptional. The restaurant also appears to be unlicensed, so either bring your own or slurp up a thick yoghurty Mango Lassi. On the whole, though, despite Diwana totally thwarting my attempts to kill some time, I'd recommend it to anyone who prefers their fast-food Indian.",

    "text": "\"Hi Andrew, I'm in London for the day. Feel like trying some awesome Indian food?\" Well that's a rhetorical question right? Of course I want to go! I got this text from a friend while I was eating brunch up in Stoke Newington (check the map...it actually is in London...I had to look twice to make sure) at a cute little french patisserie that has perhaps the best almond croissant I have had to date (including those in Paris...). A couple of hours later I was standing outside this restaurant, shivering in the cold or perhaps with longing at the multitude of platters I could see through the large front windows. The windows that did nothing to block the mouth watering aromas coming from within. To set the stage for this meal, I've got to note two things. First, I love meat. I prefer to have meat in everything and have the idea that a salad is something that adds color to my burger. Second, this place is fully veggie and no meat to be seen. So while the sights and smells were good, I was a bit doubtful at this place's ability to...well keep me satisfied.I was wrong...oh so so wrong...but in the best way possible. I'm not sure what it is that pushed me over the edge into admitting it, perhaps the curried mushrooms that were fresh and spicy, the light fluffi breads, the crunchy chick peas, or the sauteed potatoes and onions. Or maybe it was the assortment of dishes I couldn't even name that melded together in an wave of vegetable heaven. I even sort of felt healthy eating two heaped plates of the stuff...before I started on dessert that is. Dessert was two sugar syrup soaked gulab jamun, a piece of cococut sweet, and what I think was a form of fruitcake. Great stuff and spiked my blood sugar level to all new highs.I'm definitely going back to this place. It's got great food and the buffet is only \u00a37! From what I hear, the dosas are on a whole different level so that's next on the eating list!",

    "text": "We only came to London for the first time in 2003. The culinary revolution was in full swing, so basically going to an Indian restaurant was no longer necessary to ensure a good meal because the indigenous restauranteurs and publicans had started treating their patrons palates with kindness and respect. But I came to realize on this last trip that there are folks from areas of the subcontinent who aren't represented near where we live, which gave me the idea of exploring their cuisines during our week-long stay. Enter Diwana Bhel Poori House, where we had our first dinner of the vacation.We loved everything we had, including a poori dish (but not THE poori dish they're known for that we now have to go back to London to try because it looked really good on other patrons' plates) which was great and came with sauces so delicious I considered drinking the leftovers, a dosa (but not THE dosa they're known for that we now have to go back to London to try because it looked really good on other patrons' plates) which was stuffed with spinach and cheese, and our first karahi dish (we got the paneer, though I'd love to try the mixed veg one next time) which was so good I'm working on perfecting karahi sauce at home. I'm making progress on my karahi, but plan to come back to London as soon as I can and hitting this place when I do--you know... just to make sure I have it down right.",

    "text": "This place is right on the street where there are two other vegetarian Indian buffets, and it will probably be the first one you come across when you walk onto the street. \u00a0I've only been here for the indian buffet during lunch, from 12-2:30pm. I have to say, in general, the bang for the buck for all the buffets on this street is pretty good, as they are all priced the same. \u00a0They have an ample variety of selections, and the flavors and spices are all really different and appeal to palates of all types! \u00a0Ravi Shankar, the one right next door, seems to be a bit more mild and the flavors of the dishes are more similar to one another. \u00a0However, it is a bit cleaner and the service seems to be better, and the staff in general is friendlier. \u00a0Diwana Bhel does taste better though, if you like stronger spices and curries and can handle cold shoulders from the waitstaff pretty well. \u00a0They seem to be under the impression that if you are here for the buffet, they don't really need to treat you like a real customer. \u00a0Or maybe this is just typical indifferent British hospitality.Either way, the deal is great and the food is solid, and if you are hungry and craving a wide selection of curries, sauces, and salads, then this will certainly satisfy you without leaving your wallet starving! Oh, and if you go towards the later end of the day, they tend to run out of some things and not bother refilling it. \u00a0So try to go early!",

It's the real deal.I'm not a vegetarian but love good vegetarian food.Multiple tasty salads, chapattis and pappadoms, several different hot dishes with paneer, daal, veg curries, crunchy, battered pakoras, spicy chick peas, cooling raita. All excellent and delicious and while probably quite sinful if you ate every day, it's definitely not too oily or salty.Whatever combination you add to your plate, it's always good and works together. I especially like the combination of flavours and textures that makes for a great meal. Each dish has it's own distinct flavours and spices. Wonderful.Afterwards, you can sample some great Indian deserts. Gulab jamun and little squares of other tasty Indian sweets and fruits. What a treat.Great value at \u00a36.95 for an excellent and filling lunch.They have plenty of good menu items too for the evening, especially the behl poori \u00a0/ chaat snack disches with puffed rice, yoghurt and tamarind sauces.The interior is quite basic and cramped but it's the food you go for here.Quick tip: The Ravi Shankar restaurant about 2 doors down is equally as good. I alternate between the two...It has to be 5 stars for me for the combination of excellent food and great value lunch.",

For the desis-I might be a little too critical for someone who stuffed her face at this joint, but the food was disappointingly bland. That said the quality of the food was good. We were the only Indians here at lunch time & it was packed (that set off the first alarm). They had decent 'patra' or 'aloochi wadi' & also had 'aloo kadi'. Both these things are a little hard to come by in buffets. The 'kheer' & 'chana chaat' were good & so was the 'aloo palak' & 'gobhi manchurian'. The 'chapatis' were dry & there were about 5 different kinds of salads with avocado in them (huh?)Definitely worth a try to see if this is up your alley.Couldn't see the kitchen, didn't use the bathroom.The staff were polite but not Masala Zone friendly.",

This was followed up by a long dosa (\u00a37), filled with a potato mix and served with coconut chutney (cocochutney?), and a couple of other curry sauces. \u00a0Whilst decent - especially with the sauces - I thought the filling was a bit on the bland side. \u00a0Still, it was filling, and I did like the accompaniments.This is a great place for a quick-and-cheap-and-easy-and-filling lunch/dinner (I'd be tempted to do it for breakfast. \u00a0How I miss roti canai...). \u00a0Sure, it's not a world-beater, but it's a lot more interesting than your standard curry house and worth going for the bhel poori alone. \u00a0I'm usually fairly sceptical of buffets too, but this one could tempt me to the dark side...",

Our first trip was to the buffet on a Saturday lunchtime, which was an eye opener. All you can eat, all veggie, all great and under a tenner! Since then I've also been there in the evenings, when the a la carte menu is available - it is a bit more expensive, but overall you'll still eat for under \u00a315. The decor is basic - it is more of a cafe than a restaurant - and old fashioned at that. Cutlery is also basic (cheap metal implements) and water comes in metal beakers too. Service is also a bit haphazard, and the main downer is that on one trip there it took rather long to get (and pay) the bill, which always upsets my other half. But the big plus is the food - very authentic, very spicy, and lots of it. As you might guess, it is not a well kept secret, and you may have to queue when they are busy, and it is usually packed inside.",

I find the drinks by far the weakest link and the least reasonable \"bang for buck\". \u00a0The tea isn't strong, the purportedly fresh passion fruit juice had a tang to it that made me question that claim, and around the 2.50 point they were definitely not worth 1/3 of the magnificent dosa platter.Bottom line: when I'm craving a dosa, Diwana always comes to mind; it's solid, well-located, I've never had issues with efficiency of food arriving to table, and it's reasonable. \u00a0That said, if I were on the other side of the city, I'd also be willing to give some other options a try. \u00a0And would not go on a date here with a hella-tall guy who wanted to lean back and relax while eating (wooden benches are prohibitive).Yelp note: I don't know if this applies to all times of day, but if you go early the corkage is a big fat wallet-saving 0$! \u00a0So, y'know...do that. \u00a0The guy next to me was getting down, hardcore, on some brews along with his bhel poori.",

It's quite a small restaurant though, so just be prepared for that!We looked at the menu, but all the lunch mains are around \u00a37. And at lunch, there's a buffet for \u00a37, so it seemed like the obvious choice! So buffet it is! There's a huge selection of food available on the buffet, so it's really easy just to go nuts. However, since it's lunch, I try to be reasonable, so I just went for tiny spoons of the things I wanted (although I did go back for tiny spoons of a few more things as well). For me the highlights were the fried chilis. They were freaking amazing. Some of the curries are nice as well. And it's all vegetarian, so you can at least delude yourself into thinking you're eating healthy. There's also a bit of dessert including fruit, gulab jamun (YUM) and some other weird gelatinous things (which were also tasty). The service is a bit awful though, which is why I only give it three stars. I mean, it took about ten minutes for our drink to arrive. And all we ordered was a diet coke. And another table got really annoyed when they were ignored for awhile. Since the majority of people were only getting the buffet, there's not really an excuse for the service, is there?",

    "text": "My decision to give this place a 5-star rating stems both from my desperation for Indian food and the fact that Diwana Bhel really is just that good. The bottom line is that my meal was great and that I'm definitely coming back!I came for dinner (the place was busy for a Tuesday) and ordered the Rava Deluxe Dosa (basically a Rava Masala Dosa), and I was very happy with it. The sambar was nice and spicy! The two chutneys tasted very fresh. I'll definitely be back for more.One thing I don't like: you can't order any appetizers or drinks or chaat unless you've ordered them alongside a main dish. As I love to make a meal out of a few appetizers, this annoyed me. I might have ordered some chaat alongside my dosa, but the food would have been too much! A money-making scheme, to be sure. I prefer restaurants to be less in my face about the fact that they're trying to squeeze as much money out of me as possible.Tip: They don't like to seat you unless your whole party is at the restaurant.",

    "text": "This is by far the best vegetarian Indian buffet I have ever been to. Since it's been around for over 40 years (vegetarian buffets did exist back then), they have really perfected the art of preparing thoughtfully spiced and cooked food. Rather than it being an economical choice to prepare vegetarian food, the food they prepare is specifically made for other vegetarians and vegans who need a lot of protein-rich peas and vegetables. In terms of quality of food, it is incomparable. I have tried all the Indian vegetarian buffets on Drummond Street's Indian buffet row (including Ravi Shankar), and this one offers the best food in terms of preparation and quality of ingredients.Three things that constitute this vegetarian buffet as being the best:1. Less potatoes, the better.Sometimes Indian buffet-styled foods are plagued with dishes that have too many potatoes, whereas there are hardly any potatoes here. The other buffets have a lot more potato dishes. This place really emphasizes on the spices and vegetables. Potatoes are probably the least important food a vegetarian would want to fill up on.2. There is more emphasis on vegetables and peas.The majority of the food offered in the buffet includes: broccoli, chickpeas, daal, cauliflower, onions, and vegetable options for biriyani, dosas, pakoras, thalis. Everything is topped with its own delicious curry, which presents an array of rich reds, oranges and yellows in this buffet.3. At least two people I've met in London claim to have been going to this place since the 1970s. Diwana was a cool thing back then too. Professors in London, included my thesis supervisor and an anthropologist I lived with, were part of the progressives, hippies and beatniks in the1970s who were going to Diwana. It has survived the wrath of Thatcher through the 80s and judging by the old wooden furniture and it being perpetually busy, it has left quite a legacy.Although some may construe it as arrogance to leave a bold, laminated sign upon the return of a cheque exclaiming that TIP IS NOT INCLUDED, it may be because they're not shy to ask for (or demand) appreciation for the hard work they do. Maybe.",

The lunch buffet is the obvious draw at \u00a36.95 for all you can eat (including a selection of fruits, pudding and Indian sweets for dessert). The buffet is usually pretty well-stocked and typically includes a couple salads, a couple types of rice, daal, saag aloo, a fairly wide selection of vegetarian curries, and a selection of sides - poppadoms, pickle, bhajis etc. If you miss the buffet and go at dinnertime, I'd highly recommend the thalis - excellent value for money and you get to taste a variety of dishes. The dosas are also some of the best in London, as is the bhel poori. Regarding the staff, I see some of the other reviews haven't been impressed with the service. In my experience, the service is consistently fast and cheerful, and the manager is really friendly and personable.The toilet is small and you have to be a bit of a contortionist to get in there. But given how great everything else is I'm willing to overlook that. Highly recommended for a low-key, casual meal.",

Let me say this: this place to me feel like the Indian version of a German youth hostel dining area. It's all very plain, the cutlery and plates are functional and the waiting staff is very efficient, but not overly friendly nor interested in you. All three of us went for the buffet and I liked pretty much everything. On my second helping I went for many more of the fresh salads, rather than the slightly oily curries (which were tasty nevertheless). I also ordered a sweet lassi, which was really nice and made me very happy. Last but not least, the desserts were super sweet, but really nice: I especially liked the carrot-coconut squares!All in all, a really nice place to have a decent meal for little money.",

The location is great because it's just like a couple of minutes walk from the train station.The interior was simple and a bit worn, but still cozy and nice with an all around wooden theme. It felt a bit like an Indian diner sitting by the booth. It's a bit narrow and crammed by the booths, so if you're very tall or wide, you might actually not be so comfortable sitting here.It was not even noon and the place was already busy and almost all tables taken. Service was fast. We had just a light meal here, so can not speak for the full menu. My alu gobi was OK, nothing special, it didn't have anything like an edge to it. The portion size was allright though. I ordered chapati and puri with my meal and they were a bit of a disappointment. Both breads were tiny and the puri just fell into thin crumbs the moment you touched it. It's just a bread, so no big loss, but kind of felt like paying for nothing actually. I don't agree with other reviews saying how cheap the prices are here. I've been to a lot of all vegetarian restaurants that are cheaper. I would not call this place over priced, but for what it is, the prices could be slightly lower. Oh well, it is London after all. I must admit I have had better vegetarian food. But would still be willing to give this restaurant another try, because I'm still really not understing all the hype about this place.",

So on the balance of it I thought - Good but not something I'd bring my friends to. 3 stars.But that was before I had their Bhel Puri. If I was qualified enough to declare this was the \"best bhel puri in london\" I would. But I probably haven't tried it all yet. That 1 dish adds a star to the score. The quantity was large and the taste even larger ;) but sadly only the bhel puri. So net-net - 4 stars and a return visit for either the lunch or the bhel puris.",

Highly suggest you do so..but anw, the prata was good and Thali was good too. It's small and simple, and probably a good place for you to come by if you're out of food options and would like to sample Gujarati food. :)",

It's not super authentic, but the is great, and pretty cheap. I loved the talis, the coconut chutneys, bhel puri, a decent lassi, and their infamous dosas are pretty great. My vegetarian friend was super happy too. Also, it's BYOB, so it's easy enough to grab a bottle of wine down the road, attempt to get comfy, and munch some lovely stuff.",

    "text": "Drummond street is an London institution when it comes to Indian food. There are a number of established Indians restaurants that have been kicking it since the 80s, still value for money, and well worth a visit. We hit up Diwana and We all got the thaali. And it was Great Gujarati thaali.Great dhaal, good subsi. Authentic flavours. Puris were a bit dry, I don't how they dropped the ball there. Good portion sizes. Would recommend. The decor is straight forward study but comfy wooden furniture. We were served by the owner I presume and we had a good chat. Friendly sort. He had that clipped brusque manner in speech which could be construed as curt if you're not clued into it. It's a cultural thing, pay it no mind. We came in at about 5 pm and it was pretty quiet so we were served very quickly. I did not get to experience this (came too late in the day) but they have U.N.L.I.M.I.T.E.D. .T.H.A.L.I for \u00a37 over lunch. \u00a0Excellent! Will be back, next time I'm in London with time to kill at Euston.",

    "text": "My family has been going to Diwana since long before I was born, but we've finally had enough. Diwana is not entirely without merit: the food is delicious, and incredibly cheap! The bhel puri (~$4) is just awesome, and it's kept us coming back for decades, even as this place's service got worse and worse.  But after my recent experience at Diwana, I will never return. First, four of us arrived, and ordered some food. The waiter aggressively complained that we'd ordered an insufficient amount of food (but we ordered more than $40 worth!). I wish we'd walked out then, but it only gets worse... The food came out, and it was superb, as usual. It was during the payment that the real fiasco began: at Diwana, they include a standard \"voluntary\" 12.5% service fee on all orders. But---unlike other restaurants in London with that same service fee policy---they then include an option to add a tip on the bill. Sleezy, but whatever. Anyway, as my mother was paying, the waiter leaned over her and attempted to enter a 25% tip on her credit card in an extremely aggressive manner. He literally ***grabbed the payment machine from her hand*** and began to enter this tip amount. Not cool. Really not cool.",

For some reason I still thought I wanted the thali, but the waiter took a paint by numbers approach and basically told me the buffet had more variety and was cheaper. Sold.--helpful service--decent food--cheapRecommended in this area. I had stopped by the Indian YMCA, but it wasn't open for lunch yet. It turned out to be more expensive and, based on their posted menu, had less variety.Recommended in this area.",

The prices are incredible for the portion sizes and quality of food. Being half Indian, I know what good Indian street food should taste like, and this did not disappoint. We had the Bhel Puri, Dahi puri, paneer dosa and Channa masala. The food came out quick and tasted great. My only critique was that it took awhile for us to get the check, and when we were paying the server immediately selected 25% gratuity as he handed us the card machine. It was presumptive on his part seeing as the service was average at best due to the busy nature of the restaurant and few staff present. However, all in all, I would recommend this restaurant to lovers of Indian vegetarian snack food!",

    "text": "Is it a 3*** or a 4**** ... tricky because the food is pretty good I have to say, but not at all impressed by the rock hard, super narrow and immovable seats, the tight fit tables (all literally nailed to the floor) or the mildly surly and somewhat mixed service. Most of the decent tables were apparently reserved. Even the table in the window that we first sat at, and which wasn't reserved when we entered but which we were asked to move from, then has a reserved sign placed on it! No one came in to occupy that table or any other reserved table for the 45 minutes we sat in there! When I paid by card I was 'encouraged' to add a tip to the bill and the person stood over me as I put in my pin - a tad insensitive around security in my opinion! Anyway, the sweet lassi was delicious, the service brisk and the food definitely enjoyable. I had the most expensive Thali and I'd recommend it. The bill for two came to around \u00a320 (with tip!)Would I go there again? Doubt it, because I don't want to be herded about from nice table to very uncomfortable table on the apparent whim of a waiter - seriously poor! I may try it again if I can go back in and choose a table I actually want to sit in. If I can't sit somewhere comfy and relaxing, I'll turn and go elsewhere!So \u00a0a mixed review. They let themselves down on service which meant I enjoyed my meal far less than I might otherwise! You get the impression it's all about customer turnover and 'my place my rules', but if that's how it is then they've lost my future custom. To be fair they're not alone in this kind of approach around Drummond St, but there are plenty of other options nearby who have a more relaxing attitude. Take your pick ... if it doesn't feel right when you first go into a place just head out the door. It's what we should have done.",
