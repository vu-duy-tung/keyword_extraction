There's a lovely young, chatty crowd. Very inviting, which I like.GREAT selection of beers at the bar, genuinely nothing I love more than choosing carefully my ONE pint. The service was great as well!Its got the great decor of a comfy pub to me, with massive church style candles on some of the tables and the windows draped in fairy lights. It was a little noisy, but hey its a Friday, I'm no begrudger, when a place is jammed and people are having fun. All it did was encourage me to come back again earlier or on a Sunday for some Food, which I will.White Hart's got a spot in my heart anyway.",

Suddenly, just a block away from the busy roads and imposing railway architecture are two or three beautiful little Victorian terraced steets and their warm local pub. It's a time-warp place. The street looks like the opening scene in 1984 and the pubs jukebox doesn't look changed since 1964. Fortunately the pub grub is up-to-date with some noveau burger options to go with the great value baguettes, bangers and mash and snack platters. The beer selection is good too... at least 3 Belgians on tap plus real ales, Aspalls and some Sierra too.It's a small busy place full of good people. Such a rarity in Waterloo that you can ask the question... 'Why tell everyone else about this gem?'Another question you can ask is... 'How did 2 pints of the same ale come to \u00a36.15?'. That one baffled us all night.",

There is a decent selection of beer on tap, including strawberry cider which was enjoyed by some female colleagues. We came for lunch and even with a group of 10 they would take the order at the table. We had to line up, order and pay at the bar. This seemed to be a very slow process. While some of us were in line, others walked through the door and were served before us, so it was a bit frustrating. Because some of us had to wait to order our food because of people cutting, when the food was served to our table it also came in two waves. Half the group was done eating by the time the rest of us received our food. Once the food did arrive it was very good. I had the burger with Monterey Jack (no bacon) and chips. The burger was served on a really nice roll, though it could have been a bit thicker. The chips were fantastic, thick slices of potatoes fried just right. The pub has good atmosphere about it. The furniture is worn and chairs a bit scraggly contributing to more comfortable feel, but not posh. The walls are graced with artful photos of various tube stations. Finally, because we paid for our food when we ordered it did make it very easy leave once we were done. There was no waiting for the bill and there was worry about leaving a tip for the service. The food and atmosphere is right, just don't be in a rush!",

We were looking for an English pub to eat at, and most of them in the main Waterloo area were absolutely slammed, so it's a relieve to find this little place.We walked in and they didn't have any tables, but they were really friendly so we hung out at the bar for a little bit until one opened up. They actually helped us get a seat, which was very nice of them. Most people just seemed to be here for pre-game -- get a drink, have a chat, and leave. We actually were interested in having dinner, and we ordered a caesar salad, the fish and chips, and one of the Sunday roasts.Caesar salad was, well, caesar salad. It would've been quite normal except for the little fillets of anchovies. Nice touch. The fish and chips was huge. It was a big fish fillet, and it was fresh and delicious. The mister really enjoyed it (guess we didn't go to the UK for nothing!). However, my sunday roast beef was so-so. The gravy was quite bland, and the meat was pretty tough until I get to the stuffing. At least the stuffing was good.The environment was friendly, the food was decent, and the price wouldn't break your bank. This is definitely a cute little pub to visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "English pubs and I are starting to become good friends - something I had never thought would happen. \u00a0Coming here for lunch was not my idea, but I was too hungry to protest. As soon as you walk into this place, the smell of mouldy mop overwhelms you - something I have come to accept at these places, either mouldy mop or bathroom - i'll pick mouldy mop please...Sitting down in a near empty pub during weekday lunch hours plummeted my confidence in this choice, but at this point, there was nothing we can do. I picked up their 2 for \u00a320 lunch specials where two lunch items and two drinks (beer too) will cost you \u00a320 and almost went for some of stuff on the menu when my eyes came across the regular menu that had Pork Chorizo burger - erm...i'll take that for \u00a311. My colleague also had his eyes on the pastrami sandwich for \u00a36 so we decided to split the two. GREAT IDEA! I was so happily surprised that the food here is actually quite awesome. The burger was juicy and flavourful dripping with caramelized onions while the pastrami sandwich was the bomb. The pastrami covered in peppercorn was intense in flavour and paired nicely with the pickled red vegetables and coleslaw. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I walked away extremely satisfied. The only glitch in the whole experience was when two of our coworkers realized that they both got items from the lunch special and didnt realize it and when they tried to ask for the free drinks (each menu special on its own are just under \u00a310) the dude said no. That was kinda sad.",

Honestly, have we a furniture hoarding problem?The proprietor could also benefit from a few management lessons - I'd recommend starting with human resourcing: your staff should be selling and serving, not testily shepherding guests into your miserable 2x4 feet smoking pen and playing safety patrol on Cornwall Road.This ragtag operation is truly giving White Hart a bad name.",

Good selection of beer and ale so we ordered away. Bartenders were all nice and helpful to the new \"Americans\" in the bar.

Located on Cornwall Road, just one blocks south of the Waterloo tube stop, the White Hart is a quintessential British pub. The big wooden tables are great for groups, while the small, cozy nooks are perfect for grabbing for a drink with that special someone :)I recommend going in the afternoons, as it can be hard to get a table after 6 or so. Plus, during lunch time they have a great special where you can get a sandwich and a pint for only \u00a35. They have a terrific selection of beers on tap, including some of my personal favorites: Peroni, Leffe Blonde, Hoegaarden and Fruli (an amazing strawberry beer).",

I love that this pub serves beer in a caste (something that is extremely difficult to find in the United States) and the bartenders were knowledgeable about their drinks. Everyone was pretty friendly and the fish and chips were phenomenal. My boyfriend had the meat pie and that was very good too. To be honest it was a little difficult to find food that I liked in England (other than my family's cooking :]) but this place truly left a good impression. Although the menu was small everything was cooked and served very well. In terms of the menu being traditional I think that when most people go to an English pub they do expect fish and chips, meat pie, some sort of burger and roast. The burger on their menu was also very good; I was pleasantly surprised. This place is a must on my list the next time I am in London.",

The cod was oddly-shaped on my dish, but nonetheless well-fried. This was probably one of the better, if not the best fish and chips I had in a pub in London! Yes, I know that's verrrry bold statement. There was a decent amount of chips on the dish, but not overwhelmingly a lot. As for the mushy peas, I was never a huge fan of them, but they were still ok despite my lack of interest in it.HOMEMADE CHICKEN POT PIE SERVED WITH CREAMY MASH AND ROASTED VEGThis was my girlfriend's dish so I didn't get to try much of it, but from what I tried and saw it was pretty good. First of all, the pie looked huge, but when she dug into it, we realized it was mostly hot air inside. We liked the chicken and the sauce was tasty. Also, there was a healthy serving of roasted potatoes and veggies to the side that mixed well.This was a really nice, quiet pub. There was plenty of spacing in between tables and seats and there was no overcrowding inside when we were there. The fish and chips were really good and absolutely was the most flavorful fish and chips we had tried in London!",

My husband had the bangers and mash, very rich and delicious. Beautiful presentation, too. I had a bacon cheeseburger. It was smoky and charred nicely. Very juicy and satisfying. One of our best meals in London.The staff were pleasant but not very attentive. Could be de rigeur for a pub. Overall, it was still a good experience.",

    "text": "We chose this place on our last night in London, aiming for a typical London pub with that British pub feel and typical food. Totally found it! Love the look of this place. Cozy, small-ish size. 5 stars for cozyness.It was busy and tables were all full but we grabbed one drink and shortly one opened up. There seem to be no waiter service in London because nobody came to clean the previous people's food off of our table, we had to push it to the side until halfway through the meal when someone noticed. Also we didn't go to enough restaurants in London to tell, but I guess here you just order food at the bar? That seemed to be the way it was in 3 places we ate at.So we ordered up at the bar after waiting 20min for a waiter that never came. We were told one dish was sold out so we picked another. 20min later the bartender came over and told us the other dish was sold out, so I picked another and he left. Then he came back saying that one was also sold out!THIS is why I still give it 4 stars after all the food being sold out... What we did end up with (despite it not being our first, second, or third choice) was still amazing and exactly what we were looking for when we chose this pub. It was a beef pie and then fish & chips. I loved it all and was so satisfied with it being the last meal of the trip.Definitely go to this place if you get the chance and are nearby all the touristy areas. It's a short walk and is probably one of the more traditional home-y dining you'll get in the area.",

Very warm and inviting ambience with great beer, and incredible food (we had a pot pie and fish & Chips).I have to knock down to 4 stars because the kitchen was missing many of the menu items that we would have preferred to order but they ran out. So if you plan on coming here for dinner you may want to plan to arrive early in the evening.",

I had a Kwak beer (I know it's strong but I love strong Belgian beers) and my friend had a coke.The roast,as I said, was really tasty and all the ingredients were properly cooked from the meat till the vegetables.The only con is the price :don't expect to spend less than 20\u00a3pp with for a Sunday roast and a drink.",
