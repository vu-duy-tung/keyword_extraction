I'm sure the staff meant well but wow, the service was sooo sloooowwww. I estimate that it took the waiter 10 minutes to take our order, another 30 minutes to serve us our food and then 20 minutes to give us our bill after we asked for it...twice! Besides the fact that our dinner took about three hours, the food was delicious and spicy. I got the spring rolls to start and the barbeque chicken on rice with a nice selection of sauces. The mean left me satisfied but the service left much to be desired...",

Don't go for the ambiance or the service - just go for the food. Better yet, get takeaway and enjoy it at home (but your car will never smell the same again). I think it's run by Singaporeans, so the menu's a bit of a medley - but they are foodies at heart.",

    "text": "I had dined here years, possibly decades ago and never returned. However, as I was in the area on Saturday, I decided to give it another go.Firstly, although its name is Satay House and they do offer satay as a starter, it isn't a restaurant which specialises in satay. It does offer a good mix of mainly Malaysian food with some Indonesian thrown in. Certainly the kitchen staff speak Malay - a good sign in my book.As it was raining, I stood under the restaurant awning. I was there at 10 to 6 and the staff saw me and left me there until 6. They then gave me the 'Do you have a reservation? Oh you don't (sigh) Let me check\" routine. Very irritating when you're standing in a completely empty restaurant at opening time.Over the next 90 minutes, only 2 more groups arrived and they were both given the same routine. A tip to restauranteurs - unless you're el Bulli and get booked solid for the next 6 months on the day that reservations open for the season, please learn to make your customers feel welcome. Customer service 101.Anyway rant over and I perused the yummy looking menu. I then had to try to attract the attention of the waitresses who were loudly discussing the personal life of one of them. Interesting to listen to in a 'News of the World' kind of way but I think my loudly growling tummy eventually persuaded one of them to come over to take my order.She was honest enough to say that the soya bean drink was out of a carton so I opted for watermelon juice instead. It was lovely and refreshing if a bit pricey at \u00a33.30.I had spied that they offered roti canai with onion and egg, making it the first place that I'd seen it offered in London. Lots of places offer it but without the onion and egg. When it arrived, my heart leapt at seeing a proper square roti canai. Everywhere else that serves it has given me round ones, which look suspiciously like the frozen ones that I buy from the Chinese supermarket. This roti canai was definitely freshly made and if a little stingy with the onion filling, tasted just like the ones from Malaysia. I didn't think the vegetable dalca they served with it really did the bread justice and on my next visit, I'm going to ask if they can let me have some proper curry sauce to go with it.For my main course, I went with the curry noodles and this dish lives or dies by the quality of the curry soup in which all the other ingredients are sitting. Well, I'm very glad to report that it had a wonderful rich, rounded, deep flavour. There were generous amounts of chicken and prawns along with the noodles and vegetables. Most delicious.By the end of the meal, 4 serving staff had arrived. The Malay-speaking girl was the only one to make an effort with the guests. Just a shame that some of her other colleagues didn't really raise much of a smile. In fact, the male waiter had about as much warmth as a polar bear's bum which had been sitting on an ice block for a day.However, the food was lovely and I'll be back to try more dishes. Just hope they're sent their waiting staff to charm school by then",

It is always busy due to due the value for money and the smart decor (a 2006 makeover by the designers responsible for the Gourmet Burger Kitchen and \u00a0Wagamama) and had been in operation for almost 40 years. The decor is very simple: cream, brown and white interior with the odd orchid plant here and there. The main emphasis is on the quality of the food. It'll come as no surprise that my favourite dish here is lamb satay skewers, marinated in spices and herbs (6 for \u00a36.10) but I also recommend the Chicken Nasi Campur curry with MurtabakBread (filled with minced lamb, egg and served with pickled onions and dalca). The drinks too, are just as unusual. Malaysian lychee and melon juice make great mixers for the full bar of spirits.",

The satay was ok, laksa was decent without being special. The roti however was good. Portions were decent. Service was a little slow but they were courteous.

    "text": "I remember first reading about this place as one that apparently the Prime Minister of Malaysia used to come and eat at when visiting town. It also happens to feature quite frequently in the listings in Time Out magazine. It looks small on the outside, and you can tell they've put in as many as tables as they could without making it too uncomfortable. The top floor entrance seemed buzzing with people, and with our 8:30pm booking, we ended up downstairs where it was a little bit less frenzied and a bit more relaxed. Large teardrop lightings fill the olive green painted walls with warmth with the dark brown square tables providing a sharp contrast to the dining atmosphere. They even had a more intimate dining 'alcove' downstairs which we saw one party fill, complete with mini teardrop downlights and black pseudo-leather couches. Compared to a lot of other places, I have to say that their menu all looked really tempting and it was pretty hard to stay focused without being distracted by all they had to offer. Their menu is organised around rice, noodle, sides, chicken, beef, fish, prawn, vegetable and for those who can't make up their minds, a series of different set menus matching both appetite and budget (\u00a315.50 - \u00a326.50) All of their dishes really impressed me and I thought worth the little bit more that they charge. The very simple Nasi Aayam (steamed chicken with rice served with soy and chilli sauce) remained thoroughly moist and flavourful, even without the dipping sauces. The satay sticks had their perfect amount of smokiness, and also remained moist with the only downside being the peanut sauce not being as spicy as I would have liked it (and understanding that it typically isn't that spicy). I also liked the fact that their mee goreng (friend noodles) contained plenty of flavour and not just soy sauce as evident from the heat given off from whatever chilli paste they used throughout it. The only fault I can really give this restaurant was the rather lack lustre service that was never in your face yet, nor was it particularly attentive when you did want something.",

    "text": "Satay House - Pics at The London Foodie (thelondonfoodie.co.uk/20\u2026 ) I am enjoying the 2010 Malaysian Kitchen Campaign a great deal. The opportunity to find out more about one of the most fascinating but relatively undiscovered Asian cuisines (and eat a lot of it in the process), right here in London, is an opportunity not to be missed. I was lucky enough to have been involved in this campaign for the launch of the Malaysian Dining Card at Kiasu (reviewed here), and more recently as part of a Malaysian restaurant tour which included Awana, Satay House and Tukdin. The event was organised to showcase what these restaurants will be offering at the Malaysian Section of this year's Taste of London Festival. We were whisked away to our next stop, Satay House in Paddington. The restaurant is small and casual with a modern feel about it. Our first round of main courses was served at this delightful restaurant, and in my opinion, one of the most successful dishes was the Udang Galah Goreng (king prawns fried in turmeric, chillies, lime leaves and coconut milk). The prawns were meaty but still soft and their richness was offset by the lime's citric flavours and the delicate coconut milk. The Rendang Daging (slow cooked beef in spices, herbs and coconut milk) was also noteworthy. I enjoyed the rich flavours of cinnamon, cloves and star anise infused in the very tender meat. I love aubergines and so quite enjoyed Terong Goreng Berlada (aubergines stir-fried with ground chillies and shrimps) despite feeling that it was a little overspiced. Less successful dishes were the Satay (chicken and lamb skewers served with a peanut sauce) and the Kway Teow Goreng (stir-fried flat rice noodles with seafood, egg and vegetables). The former was slightly on the tough side whereas the noodles lacked the delicious combination of flavours that I have experienced from this dish elsewhere.",

The spring roll starter was generic at best; its sauce was the only redeeming factor. My Gado Gado was tasty, primarily if not wholly because of the sauce/dressing. My husband did not enjoy his curry, complaining that the chicken was of poor quality. He didn't finish it, which is unlike him and must mean it was truly poor (as a vegetarian, I didn't taste it myself).We received our food about thirty minutes after the people next to us received theirs, and they arrived at the restaurant at least 30 minutes after we did. We sat and waited for what seemed like forever before we could catch the eye of a server to request the bill. We then waited for at least 15 minutes to receive it and another 15 minutes to pay with a credit card. Although we arrived at a generally early dining hour, we left so late that I was worried the tube might have closed.",

    "text": "The day I went to Satay House is one of the more memorables of my last trip to London. I Googled for Singaporean and Malaysian places, and Satay House ended up being the most highly recommended one that I hadn't been to. Read somewhere that the prime minister of Malaysia comes here when he's in London (disclaimer: don't know if it's true, but I could definitely believe it).I had just a few days in London, and many of the meals were taken up by friends. I actually had lunch plans on this day already, meeting up at Notting Hill. I decided I would take two lunches that day and headed out to Paddington for the earlier lunch. Took a bit of searching as I'm not familiar with the area and the sign isn't very conspicuous. Walked in, and heard Malay being spoken at the tables. Of all the languages you hear walking around London, Malay's not at the top of the list. This was a Good Sign.The waitress was blond(!) but spoke Malay (!!) with the other customers. I ordered their trademark nasi lemak. It was a bit of a risk, because honestly, I've never been impressed by nasi lemak outside of Singapore/Malaysia. Further sceptical because it had shrimp, instead of fish or chicken. Then it came, and the portion looked a little on the small side. Hmm.In the first bite or two, I actually wasn't sure I'd be able to eat the whole thing, it was so spicy. I don't think I've ever eaten something that spicy in a restaurant, and I'm not sure I've ever made something that spicy intentionally. And I adore spicy food. I believe there's no dish that can't be made better by adding black pepper/white pepper/chili flakes/chili sauce/fresh cut chilis/jalapenos/Tabasco sauce, etc. Just pick your poison. Anyway, after the initial shock, my taste buds adapted, and the nasi lemak was a total food orgasm. Not necessarily your traditional nasi lemak (shrimp and all), but the combination of flavours and textures with the rice, peanuts, and ikan bilis were just divine.I finished it all, and couldn't have eaten another bite. Turned out to be the perfect portion size. I paid the bill quickly and went to Notting Hill, wondering how I was going to explain that I was full going into lunch. Well, luckily I didn't have to worry about that, because there were massive and hilarious miscommunications due to a friend who still didn't have a mobile phone. We ended up looking for each other for more than an hour, then walked a good way to a bog-standard pub, by which point I actually was a little hungry again.Conclusion: Satay House = win.",

    "text": "This is my favourite \"Malay\" Malaysian restaurant in London (compared to others e.g. Mawar (now Melur), Naha (now Bonda), Jom Makan, etc). These are different to the \"Chinese\" Malaysian restaurants (e.g. C&R, Kopitiam, Rasa Sayang) that serve food which is more influenced by the chinese (e.g. noodles, soy sauce, soup-based).The food here is authentic Malay, and was set up in the 1970s by a Malay couple from Perak, and their daughter now runs the place. When I lived near the area a few years back, I would go there at least once a week. My favourite dishes are kari kambing (lamb curry), rendang, ayam berlada, ikan berlada, sotong berempah, as these are some of their spicier/tastier dishes. Their sambal is authentic, but too expensive at \u00a34.50 for a small thimble (about 50ml).Kari kambing (goat curry) - very nice goat curry, with a woody curry flavour. The meat can be a bit gamey, but that's what u get with goat. Another reviewer mentioned it tasted more indian than east asian, which is true, because 5%-10% of malaysians are Indian and that's where most of the spicier dishes in Malaysia (Malay or Chinese) have come from. You get plenty of curry in a bowl, which is slightly watery, but great for eating with rice.Rendang (slow-cooked beef in a dry spicy sauce) - most of my Malaysian friends love this dish as their favourite (I still prefer the goat curry), as it is a ridiculously authentic version of the rendang you find in Malaysia. The beef really is slow cooked, so that it comes apart, rather than pieces of beef which I find most other restaurants serve. The flavour is deep and rich, and there is plenty of dry sauce to eat with ur rice.Ayam berlada (chilli fried chicken) - pieces of chicken that are deep fried first (so there is an outer crispy coating), and then fried with onions and chilli flakes. Be warned, there is a lot of oil with this dish.Ikan berlada (chilli fried fish) - dry fried pieces of chunky fish, with chilli flakes and loads of onions (sometimes I do find the onions a bit too much). Even though it's similarly named to the chicken version above, the fish version doesn't come swimming in oil.Sotong berempah (squid with spices) - pieces of squid cooked with curry leaves and other spices. This dish also has loads of oil. The portion is also a bit smaller than the others.Ayam percik (bbq chicken) - this version comes served with a creamy, slightly sweet sauce (most Malaysians will know ayam percik as the bbq chicken they get from the pasar malam/night market, which is dry). The chicken doesn't appear to be heavily bbq-ed (doesn't have strong grill marks), so I would guess it's been very lightly grilled. It's good for people who can't take very spicy food.For dessert, I usually go for their pisang goreng (fried banana fritters), which comes with ice cream and/or syrup. I used to like their ice kacang, but it now comes in a glass, which I find difficult to eat from. I preferred when they served it in a bowl. Their sago is good, and so is their cendol.Note: As a Malaysian, we don't typically go for starters, so I cannot comment on their spring rolls. I have tried their satay, which is good. Their begedil is average.In terms of \"anglicised\" dishes, which one reviewer mentioned, I feel this is true of their ayam masak merah and ayam percik. However, the other dishes I have described above are truly authentic Malaysian dishes. If anyone wants to try authentic Malay Malaysian food, I recommend their rendang and ayam berlada with rice, along with the kangkong belacan.",

We're all about the sharing, so bits of nasi lemak, roti canai (we re-ordered, sooo good), tom yum soup, beef rendang, tahu sumbat and kway teow goreng flew around our little table.Everything was wonderful; fresh, flavourful, spicy. I ordered the nasi lemak on the recommendation of my best friend, who said she had really enjoyed it before. It turned out she hadn't had it there at all, but at another place, and when it arrived I was skeptical that I'd made the right choice.The various ingredients laid out on the plate (rice, cucumber, prawn curry, dried anchovies, peanuts, hard boiled egg) looked a little colourless and forlorn, not the spicy Malaysian melange I'm used to. I dove in and mixed them together though, and soon realized the error of my ways. The dish was delicious, and something I would definitely order again.",

All I know is that the place is small but with a warn atmosphere, the chicken skewers as a starter were yummy and my lamb spicy dish was to expectations. Pity though that you feel rushed all the way as they're trying to get 2/3 sittings in a 2h time frame.",

    "text": "Satay House is an established Malaysian restaurant (having been around for at least 30 years) and was all buzzy when we arrived at 8.30 this evening. Whether its urban myth or not even the Malaysian Prime Minister used to frequent this restaurant when he was in town. The Satay House has a decent selection of Malaysian food though quite a bit pricier than other restaurants I've been to. It was pretty late so we didn't eat too much sticking with chicken satay skewers, Mee Goreng (our test dish for all things Malaysian) and Nasi Ayam (which is a fairly simple steamed chicken with rice cooked in chicken broth.) Strangely what was lacking tonight was the service. It was friendly when we finally got some attention but the waiter seemed more interested in making conversation with diners who had finished their meals and clearing tables than in taking our order. It was almost condescending how he would nod at us as if to say yes I acknowledge you are there but I will not actually serve you anyway. I don't want to let one waiter turn me off from the Satay House because to be honest good Malaysian restaurants in London are few and far in between. Prices for the services you get are a bit higher than average but I guess that's to cover the recent update that the restaurant has gone (apparently by the designers behind GBK and Wagamama.) Good atmosphere but be warned that tables are very close to each other so be prepared to hear the conversation on both sides of you and for them to hear yours! Good Malaysian \u00a0at a price.",

I hadn't been in a while, though, so when I went again last week for a friend's birthday I was surprised by a few changes. Although overall the food was still good, the portion sizes had shrunk even as the prices had gone up. Also, none of the staff seemed to be Malaysian (not that that's important) or know what they were serving. The curry of the roti canai was slightly lumpy and too thick in my opinion, but the rendang was still great. The pajeri terong (aubergine curry) was particularly tasty.Our main grudge with the place on this occasion, however, was the service. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly to us, and a couple of times forgot our order and said it was because we had failed to place them (our table of five disagreed). Maybe she (or the five of us) were having an off day, but it might be a while until I go back, even though I love the food.",

Only Satay House was still open and accepting customers (and they kept coming in even after we sat down!)I had a bowl of curry laksa which hit the spot for under 10 quid.

It was my boyfriend who found it, he's a good restaurant hunter and always discovered amazing places. This was located close (for London standards) to my place. We used to eat in the basement, tiny and usually full. I think we've tried pretty much everything there including the Satay skewers, the Rendang beef, the coated prawns and...Pisang Goreng, a dessert that blew our mind: fried banana accompanied by vanilla/dark chocolate ice cream (a bit of a treat for my taste). Seriously, if a place stays in your mind this way it's because it was remarkable. Yeah, it's remarkable. I'll go back when in London. So looking forward to it!",

Luckily, the young waiter was used to babes in the jungle. I said spicy and rice and what do you recommend? Out comes a dish of ayam masak lemak cilli cipi. It was a coconut based thin curry.

    "text": "Rasa Sayang Satay House, Paddington - not often we feast on Malaysian food in restaurants because of my Malaysian Home Cooking Supperclub. Most of the time I am also occupied with trying out new recipes, dishes and flavours. Tweaking it to perfection before making sure the dish is good enough for my supperclub. But, that is not to say that we don't eat Malaysian food in restaurants, just hardly ever. I need to keep myself informed. We feasted at Rasa Sayang Satay House restaurant upon the invitation from Contact Singapore. At the gathering, there were about 40, mostly young professionals, working in London in the accountancy and finance sector.Rasa Sayang restaurant is tiny. It is split into two floors. Nothing fancy. Just a simple dining place. Parking a pram in the restaurant space is also quite challenging. The dishes were already decided and I did not have a chance to look at the menu but you can be sure that Malaysian favourite noodle dishes such as the char kuay teow and curry laksa are on the menu.Overall, the food was generally quite good but I would have thought that on this occasion, being a special Malaysian gathering, the dishes would have the extra spice and kick and not the usual flavours as when vatering for the western public. The general agreement amongst the diners were that the ayam masak merah was not a teeny bit spicy and the prawn sambal could have had chilli heat.",

We went back for it, we thought it was very nice of them. Would definitely go next time in London!",

More of a caf\u00e9 style upstairs with a restaurant feel downstairs.The service is friendly, it's reasonably priced and although they can get very busy sometimes they do their best to accommodate you.It's relatively centrally located but it's a few minutes' walk from the nearest stations (Edgware Road, Paddington or Marble Arch).Worth a visit if you fancy Malaysian food for sure :)",

Even though it is a small family owned restaurant accompanying about 11 patrons, it does have a long history with authentic taste and flavour. The service was pleasant and the waiting time for the mains was acceptable but suggest ordering entree as they are also worth the experience. Price for the meal was acceptable to me in relation to the quality of the product. Location is quite central and easy to find. Make sure you book in advance and if ordering takeaway, be prepared to wait 30-60mins. That just illustrates how busy and popular it is.",

It was spicy and missed the note of savory which I often would expect in these dishes. I don't ding them for this but they did get my roti order incorrect (I got plain but ordered the egg and scallion) and they also forgot a a part of my order but luckily the staff chased me down the street. These are just basics that shouldn't be a miss. That said, I would give this place another chance - but dine in only and likely a basic dish that can't be messed up (or I assume) bc it smelled delicious. I want to like this place more bc I appreciate small and charming restaurants but I just can't justify due to my meal (beef dish).",

There's just too many variables to take into account that can't be recreated in a building, particularly one that has to meet food hygiene and safety standards!This said Satay House is one of the better Malaysian restaurants that tries it's best to recreate the more formal malaysian dining experience that you can get particularly in the capital of Malaysia. The sambals and chilli are not as I remember them, not as spicy and sweeter, but the satay with compressed rice, onion and cucumber were great. As was the coconut rice. Fluffy and not too salty.Each dish had plenty of flavour and the portions were decent. Whilst there is limited seating upstairs, downstairs, we were situated in a quite luxurious booth where there was a nice HD tv screening the football. It wasn't at a perfect angle for the table, but get there early and you'll have some additional entertainment to the company :)",
