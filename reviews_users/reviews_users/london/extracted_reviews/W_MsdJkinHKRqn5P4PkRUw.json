    "text": "Texture is certainly a little pretentious, but please don't let that put you off! The trick with this restaurant, I feel, is to think of it as an experience or an adventure, rather than simply a place to eat food. Although the atmosphere is a little imposing, the wating staff (of which there seem to be far too many), are actually very friendly and helpful, if a little humourless. My 2 companions and i all chose the set menu, which I think was about \u00a365 per head, and I would reccomend this to other diners too. Although 3 dishes are listed on the menu, Texture delivers a variety of interesting, slightly outlandish but always tasty food experiences between each course, which staff describe for you in some detail since it's not possible to tell what you are eating or drinking by looking at it or tasting it. I really enjoyed this aspect of my meal at Texture. It turned a meal into an adventure, and that was very pleasant. But of course, most important is the food - and this was all very good indeed. It was all well cooked, and although it was all unusual, often in texture as well as taste, I found that this was part of the enjoyment of it. Foam does feature, but not heavily and where it appears, it feels appropriate. The only slight drawback to Texture is that the wine 'list' is more like an encyclopedia - it really is several inches thick. And as the wine starts at around \u00a330 per bottle and goes up to several hundred pounds, you want a wine list you can skim for an affordable but drinkable bottle, which isn't possible with a wine list this long. That said, once we had chosen a (very nice) bottle of white for around \u00a340, the sommelier did a very good job of making it last for exactly as long as the meal did. I like Texture - and next time I need a special occasion to mark with a special (and relatively well off) friend, I shall return. I'd reccommend anyone try Texture once.",

The entrance is understated and easy to miss (we walked past twice!). The bar area (which is separate from the restaurant) is simply but elegantly decorated but quite small (probably wouldn't comfortably fit more than 25 people). The cocktails are very nice though, premium ingredients were used and this was reflected in the price. It's called a champagne bar but the drinks list is not limited to just champagne. If you've got some cash to spend and you're looking for somewhere chic, intimate and impressive (in a grown up way), Texture would be a good choice.",

As we were waiting for the rest of our group to show up at the champagne bar (well waiting really isn't the word, more like having an hour's worth of champagne/cocktails), they put down a bowl of the stuff. It is AMAZING! I can't even describe it. I wish I had a bowl of it every time I saw a movie. (At home, at the cinema. I don't care, I want it.) But enough about the popcorn (well, that's not completely true either), the eight of us took our seats and had the tasting menu. Everything on the menu was delicious, but there were definitely four stand-out courses for me. The first course of pea and mint soup was fantastic. Quite intense flavors. Next was the heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella and basil. The tomato flavor was insanely intense. The quail course was amazing, and it was served with a bit of bacon popcorn! Probably the best course of the night! The last course of passion fruit soup with basil ice cream was great! The ice cream was completely refreshing, and it was a great way to end things. The other courses were also delicious, just not quite as exciting! The bread was also really amazing.I'd definitely go back! If only for some drinks and bacon popcorn!",

    "text": "Bringing up the rear of the triple main course was a chargrilled beef rib eye served with ox cheek, horseradish, and an olive oil b\u00e9arnaise. The beef was my least favourite item, tasting distinctly of liver and even having some of the texture I associate with liver (that slightly powdery foretaste). The ox cheek was bursting with flavour and I could have easily eaten 10x the amount. Special mention must be made of the horseradish sauce that had the bite you'd expect without the intense sinus-clearing smack down you get with horseradish. I'd love to have a pot of that to spread on roast beef sandwiches in the future.The pre-dessert was a strawberry granita with a dollop of cream. The taste of strawberries was so fresh you would swear you were frolicking in a field of them and picking the succulent fruit straight off the vine to pop into your mouth. Pure bliss I tell you.Finally, dessert. This took the form of a passion fruit soup with basil ice cream, cubed mango, and a ginger granita. Now, I'm a firm believer that all desserts should have chocolate and give fruit a pass, but this dish persuaded me otherwise. A clear slightly syrupy \"soup\" created from the essences of passionfruit surrounded a pastel green scoop of basil ice cream. The cubed mango and ginger granite were artfully scattered around the bowl giving the overall impression of a spring time bloom (something we're not used to seeing in London). The flavours were incredible with the slightly sour passionfruit being balanced with the uber sweet mango and the basil ice cream providing a refreshing cleansing effect to the palate. The ginger granite provided crunch and a bit of warmth although I could have used with a tad more ginger taste (I'm a huge fan of ginger though). Overall, one of the best desserts I've eaten in a long time which pretty much says it all.Oh and the selection of petit fours are unrivaled by anything in London. Save the lollipop looking one until last, however, as it's a refreshing mint best saved to cleanse the palate at the end.Other thoughts: I didn't get the wine pairings (\u00a360 on top of the \u00a380 for the tasting menu) but the rest of the table sang the praises including Dan and Ellie who were our resident experts having lived in France for two years. The waitstaff are very friendly and tailored the menu for allergies and dislikes with ease and grace. The tasting menu took almost 4 hours to go through so be warned that this isn't a quickie but something to take your time to enjoy. Overall, a high win in my book and well deserving of its Michelin star.",

They have 7 course fish tasting menu, a scandanavian tasting menu and a la carte, which is the route we took to save time and pound sterling LOL. They started us with a thin lightly fried crackers made out of salmon skins, etc. and then then a complimentary mint peas that is sweet, salty, smooth like a pudding and have a touch of rough black pepper for texture, simple and nice. Then we had seared scallops that was big, sweet and succulent with black caviar on top and grapefruit beans, macro greens, and mascoporne bubbles. For main we had the veal cheek (very tender, to die for), and salted cod, pan seared into perfection, with white wine and shrimp sauce. It was delicate, elegant and beautiful taste! Price is very reasonable especially if you dine only a la carte. They also have lunch deal for only 21\u00a3 for 2 course tasting menu if you really want to stretch your money :) It's so worth it considering it's a michellin star restaurant.",

Finally went in and boy am i glad. We thought we would have a little tipple prior to eating (it is a champagne bar AND restaurant after all) the bar area is quite small, but cute, with a weird mixture of people. And tables with an ice bucket in the middle - pure heaven - I have to have one in my house, who needs to keep visiting the fridge when you can have ice on tap in front of you, heck these should be compulsory post 2010 on all coffee tables in production. Anyway, back to the food, we were served bacon popcorn (worked well for all the salty popcorn lovers out there) and a selction of crisps, well sliced bread, parmesan and seaweed and dip. I opted for beetroot and goats cheese for starters, followed by the chicken for main, and my was it yummy! served with an egg, bacon and a yummy lemongrass sauce, and after speaking to the maitre'd learnt that the food is cooked by sous-vide, a kind of vacuum packing to help intensify and keep flavours. Dessert I opted for strawberries complemented with a delicious 'soup' and granola and yoghurt, tasted like a very gorgeous breakfast. The chef is iclandic and aims to create healthy food, by avoiding cream and butter in the food, but my it was still so tasty. The surroundings were ecclectic. Think big white room with twigs and sand and big candles, complemented with huge paintings of volcano erruptions. Loved everything here, down to the iclandic plates on the tables! Will most certainly be returning!",

The starter was not very impressive, I can't say that I liked it that much, a beetroot dish, but from there on the menu got better with each dish. The beetroots were followed by a very nice soup and then the fowl served with sweet corn and popcorn. It sounds strange (it was actually supposed to be bacon popcorn but I couldn't really tell) but the texture combination was really interesting and very nice, especially the sauce. The best part of the tasting menu though was the dessert which was divine, I would go just to have this again. In short, recommended for a special occasion and to try their quite original dishes but not somewhere I would go just to have a good meal out.",

He teamed up with Sommelier Xavier Rousset in September 2007 to launch this place and they seem to have a good thing going. I was invited to a canape and Champagne evening so we were only in the front bar, the atmosphere was quiet but pleasant and the ice buckets in the centre of the tables was an inspired idea. Our Canape selection included Suckling Pig Spring Rolls with Hoi Sin Sauce and a selection of crisps, parmesan, codskin and crispy bread.The food was tasty, I favoured the spring rolls and the salmon but it was all interesting and with a slightly unusual edge you might expect from a kitchen with an Icelandic influence.It would be extremely interesting to go back and see what the main courses are like but I'm not sure I entirely feel I have a grasp of the place from this selection.I also appreciate it is usually quite pricey but this was complimentary",

Memorable dishes included Icelandic poached halibut with a light foam, celeriac and Jerusalem artichoke textures, beef rib eye chargrilled, ox cheek, horseradish, olive oil b\u00e9arnaise, chargrilled Anjou Pigeon with sweetcorn, shallots and red wine reduction/essence and all sorts of little subtle surprises along the way, with delicate flavours and spices. Chef, Agnar Sverrisson came and had a chat with us after the meal and the staff were all very friendly, professional and attentive. In fact, we stayed on and chatted for a long time and the staff were very kind in not asking us to leave! We didn't meet the Sommelier Xavier Rousset, although I think he served me earlier on at the bar - an excellent bar BTW! But, we did enjoy his fine choice of wines each of which perfectly accompanied the meal. One of the things I enjoyed most about dining at Texture is that I came away feeling content but not bloated. This may be in part to the chef's approach which is vacuum cooking combined with very light and healthy ingredients - not too much cream and sugar - this in no way takes away from the taste. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Some really unusual wines, and excellent with it. The more expensive wines are not supposed to be marked up pro rata so are better value. As a previous reviewer mentioned, staff very good and professional, and on my most recent visit charming and attentive Lunch is very cost effective. I will go again, it was that good. Sadly the usual +12.5% service, now ubiquitous in London. And I have been again, and it was if anything better than I remembered! And again!",

Highlights of the meal was the different types of peas (snow, shoots, and flan?) which provided variety of texture, taste and temperature. \u00a0The other thing I liked was the lamb. \u00a0It was nice presented and the burning coal might appear too much but I guess the scent was part ofnthe experience. \u00a0Cooked well and tasty. \u00a0Things which I think could be improved in the meal was the gazpacho (the deconstruction didnt kind of completely work in terms of flavor and presentation) and the dessert. \u00a0I felt the wait staff was a bit more aggressive in pushing wine compared to other similar restaurants in the area but perhaps it was just in my mind. \u00a0When I came in, the restaurant was mostly tourists and not local people from London. \u00a0One interesting thing is that they give you a gift in the end. That night it was Icelandic yogurt for breakfast. I just eventually ate it immediately since I didnt have space in my hotel's fridge...",

It was also very cold. Overall a lovely experience if you're a meat or fish eater, but for veggies a bit underwhelming, it didn't feel like I got my money's worth in the same way.",

No complaints on the food. It's really good.The decor is subtle and tasteful. In an old building but with modern decor, it was a nice visual atmosphere. Being a more modern decor, it did have a lot of hard surfaces which amplified the conversations at the adjacent tables. It also amplified the wooden heeled shoes that one of the servers wore. Seriously, it sounded like a jackhammer on the tile floor ever time she walked back and forth.One other point, the pours were a little light. I don't mean to get lit when I eat but I would like to make sure the wine lasts longer than the dish. If you are pouting a glass, the liquid needs to reach the fat of the glass.",

    "text": "This 1 Michelin restaurant is a visual and tasteful treat. The icelandic influence is clear with a clean menu and a understated elegance. The mood lighting transforms the dining experience so much, that you become desensitised to your location. The restaurant could easily been in trendy NY, Melbourne or Paris. I thoroughly enjoyed the Norwegian king crab entr\u00e9e with coconut and lime- such a fine balance of flavours and different textures of the fleshy crab, smooth coconut, crunchy nuts and the zesty lime. It was light and fresh and a great start to the meal.An entr\u00e9e is not necessary as you are offered sourdough bread with Icelandic black lava salt and spicy and sweet olive oil as well as bread like crisps and complimentary palette cleansers throughout the meal.Following the crab, I opted for the turbit, \u00a0a flat fish which swims sideways. Again, the fish was soft and broke off in juicy flakes. My dad had the US grainfed steak with ox cheek, which was melt in your mouth goodness, served with crunchy chips.The only downside is the range of champagne by the glass. Texture prides itself with 125 champagnes on offer, however there is only 5 champagnes by the glass to choose from. The sommelier is extremely knowledgeable in all things wine and can suggest one to suit your meal and wallet.Texture is contemporary/experimental dining to a fine degree with attentive, yet discreet service. Each meal is a unique experience, \u00a0pushing the boundaries of all the great things you can do with food.",

Among his suggestions was Texture. Their example menu appealed to us the most out of those we read and we thought it had a very convenient location just behind Selfridges on Oxford Street.We went for a lunch tasting menu. Neither my husband nor I had ever experienced Michelin star dining before so we were looking forward to trying several courses and experiencing an elevated level or service. Most of all, I was excited about the snow.As you might expect the food was beautifully presented and it smelled wonderful. Each course brought new and interesting flavours and textures; from asparagus and parmasan snow to pigeon with bacon popcorn. My personal favourite was the smoked salmon with diced pickles and cucumber snow; it was refreshing and livened up my taste buds. The pigeon was too smoky for my palette but my husband (a keen Islay Whisky drinker) thought it was great.It was not as expensive as I'd expected for such a nice restaurant and the staff were as happy to recommend the cheapest Champagne on the menu as they were the more expensive options. People were dressed smart-casual during the lunchtime service (men in jeans and shirts)",

    "text": "The food at Texture is proof that you don't have to douse food in cream, butter and olive oil to create delicious cuisine.I'm a huge fan of Scandinavian cuisine largely for its simple ingredients resulting in complex flavours (and techniques). Agnar Sverrisson was in the restaurant during my visit - it's always exciting to see the head chef in the kitchen! Amuse bouche was a jerusalem artichoke velout\u00e9 - very light but delicious. We were also brought a bowl of fried salmon skin and parmesan crisps...mmm, seriously addictive. I love eating fried fish skin (do give it a try even it might sound gross!) so I was very pleased. The bread was fantastic too, remniscent of rye bread that I've had in Norway before. My starter was smoked cod with potatoes and rye toast - this is probably one of my favourite starters ever. I'm generally wary of smoked fish because it can be overpowering if cooked poorly. This fish was perfectly smoked - a beautiful combination of flavours and very light. My meat dish of lamb with sweet potato puree and other vegetables was very good. However, the fish dish of pan-fried ling with quinoa and prawns was stunning! Even though it sounds something a health-freak would cook, it didn't disappoint in flavour. Dessert was Icelandic skyr with rhubarb and granita - apparently skyr is similar to a yoghurt, but technically a cheese. This was unlike anything I've had before, but I loved it. A bit tart, but very refreshing particularly with the rhubarb accompaniment. Petit fours of passionfruit macarons and cardamom chocolate truffles rounded out our meal of amazing food.The food is a bit avant-garde and probably not to everyone's taste. I personally loved Texture - the fact that Sverrisson can use minimal amounts of cream and oil in his cooking yet still produce such great food is a testament to his skill and innovative cooking philosophy. The dining room is very bright and beautiful, and service is friendly and not overbearing. Loved everything.",

Appetizers - Native Lobster and Anjou Quail - The most tender pieces of lobster I have ever had in my entire life. The quail was also equally delicious as it was perfectly charbroiled and excellently paired with the sweet corn and bacon popcorn.2. Main Course - Cornish Brill - A flawlessly cooked fish filet that was deliciously matched with a light lemongrass sauce and fresh asparagus.3. Mango Soup - Very creative desert. At first, I thought the Mango and ginger were an odd combination taste-wise. However, I grew to like it with every bite I took.Each dish was beautifully plated; every time something new was brought to the table, I went through a brief moment of hesitation where I would debate whether or not to eat so as to avoid destroying the works of art. Alas, my belly won every time, but luckily, I took lots of photos to keep the images fresh in my memory. \u00a0 At the end of my meal, Chef Sverisson accomplished his goal: I was comfortably full.If you are looking for a very unique and wonderful dining experience, Texture is the place to find that and more. 5 stars.",

    "text": "After all the glowing reviews, a friend and I were excited to try this place. We've both eaten in some of the finest restaurants in Europe, North America, and Japan, and we hoped we could add this to the list of favorite dining experiences. Unfortunately, Texture failed on both food and service-- but most egregiously on service. Throughout my lunch here, the service vascillated between aggressively rude and simply nonexistent. The problems started the moment we walked through the door. We had made a reservation for noon, and we arrived exactly on time. Rather than being seated, we were told we should have a seat in the bar to have drinks before lunch. When we suggested we planned to look at the drink offerings in the context of the menu, we were told again to sit in the bar. This was puzzling: the tables were clearly set and ready to go, there was no one else in the dining room... why were we being so strongly urged to sit in the bar? Once we finally agreed-- more out of bewilderment than anything else-- the answer became apparent. They were damn well not going to seat us until we'd ordered a glass (or preferably a bottle) of champagne. It didn't matter that it was lunchtime, and that we didn't particularly want to have drinks before we'd had a chance to consider the food-- this was obviously of no matter. Several times I tried to indicate politely that we'd prefer simply to be seated. When someone came over a second time to ask if we'd decided, I said once again that we would prefer to go straight to the food menu before deciding on drinks. Instead of taking this as his cue to seat us, he actually came back to the bar with the food menus, and for emphasis, slapped coasters in front of us. It became apparent that we had two choices: 1. Be as rude and graceless to them as they were being to us, or 2. Order a glass of champagne. We opted for #2. I consoled myself with the thought that I always love champagne. Unfortunately, this glass left a bitter taste in my mouth. Once we had been press-ganged into the drinks, we were finally permitted to be seated. We hoped the bad experience was over. Nope. Service continued to be dismal (although nothing managed to match the rudeness of the front of house staff). Some major problems:1. Several courses were brought to the table and explained while one of us was away from the table. I have NEVER been in a Michelin-starred restaurant that has managed to get this wrong once, let alone several times.2. Wine was poured while the person who ordered the bottle was away from the table and unable to taste it. 3. Every other diner in the restaurant was presented an amuse-bouche. We ordered more courses than any other table (with the exception of one four-top), and believe me, we certainly noticed when everyone else received an amuse and we didn't.Finally, the food: if you're impressed with artistic plating, then yes, Texture does that bit well. If you expect food at this level to be surprising, delightful, a treat for the palate as well as the eyes-- keep looking. There are so many better choices than this. We ordered the Scandinavian tasting menu, so I feel we got their best effort, and sadly, it didn't even begin to make up for the gauche service.",

Very much looking forward to going back sometime for another treat! Oh, and .... Bacon Flavoured Popcorn. Just brilliant :)",
