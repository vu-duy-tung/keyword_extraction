They sat us by the toilet door area where people were coming in and out and the servers were using the other door to serve people outside so it was cold. My friend dropped her coat tag on the floor and no one picked it up for 5 minutes. I mean not to sound posh but that's not something you'd expect in a restaurant like thisThe food was dry and distasteful- we had the maki rolls, sashimi, salmon tataki and miso black cod dumplings. \u00a0They made amends by taking a few items off our bill but still wouldn't go back - I like my sushi fresh and well composed. \u00a0We left feeling sick. The best thing there was the salmon tataki.",

    "text": "Having been back to london town for a short while again, this was one of the hot new sushi places that popped up that I hadn't tried. Set one of london's expensive areas- Mayfair- you already know it's going to be pricey. The real question is whether or not this place would stand up to its reputation.I usually hate to include service in my reviews, because in my books good food always trumps service. But this place was not up to standard. It was annoying that in this kind of 'up-scale' restaurant the waiters were bringing us food that we hadn't ordered, not once but several times. To add to that even though it was not crowded when I was there there was slow service. I had to mention it because it simply wasn't good enough for the kind of restaurant Roka is trying to compete with.Now for the important bit- the food. Overall their appetisers were good, but nothing special. Their miso soup was average. The actual sushi was fresh... Very very fresh. It was the freshness of all the ingredients \u00a0that made it good. I can't really describe that feeling when you take that bite of sushi and the combination tastes is just right, there aren't a lot of place that can do that.This place is known for its \"fireside Japanese cooking\" and so we had to order so grilled dishes. The steak dish was good but the chicken - although good- was something I feel I could've cooked at home. Overall I think the commotion was over its location, nice interiors, and as you'll see in the photos - nice presentation. Overall this place might be just looks. I would give it a 3.5 because it was lacking in most of the departments except for the sushi.",

    "text": "This became a London mainstay a decade ago in Charlotte Street, and the branch just off the middle of Oxford Street has cemented its reputation for nouvelle Japanese cuisine. Service is perfectly charming and efficient but the food comes out in the order it wants to. The lamb cutlets were thick and sublime, the fried aubergine a hearty surprise, and the chicken unlike any poultry I'd ever eaten at any Japanese restaurant anywhere - supreme. For desserts, we enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Yamazaki ice-cream so much we ordered it twice.The wine and cocktail selection is comprehensive as well as imaginative. This is a pricey place, but it really is special; funkier than Nobu, more upmarket than Sumosan and comparable to Zuma, it really has found its groove in London. delusionaryculinary",

There isn't much to say cuz I just think they are normal and the salmon are not very fresh I think.Rice hot pot and tofu were really delicious. Grilled vegetables we ordered were nice as well.

    "text": "The Mayfair is conveniently located being only a few minutes walk from Bond Street tube station and it is close to Selfridges, making it an excellent location to be situated. I was there on a weekday and it was buzzing with people. We were seated at a table located at the back of the restaurant, which made it a bit more private and quiet to enjoy an evening with my friendsWe ordered a selection of dishes to share but the portion are small. I would not recommend to go to Roka if you really hungry because this place can really hurt your piggy bank!Roka is suppose to be special for serving contempoary Japanese robatayaki, so we ordered some dishes under the robata section of the menu. We ordered one portion each - chicken skewers (\u00a38.90) and beef skewers (\u00a315) and for the price we only got two skewers in a portion. There are also non-skewers dishes under the Robata section of the menu and we tried the black cod. It was a nice piece of fish but an expensive piece of fish.There are selections of tempura and fried dishes. We decided we need some vegetable and ordered the tempura vegetable.I did like the gyoza and we ordered both variety that was on the menu.- Gyuniku to goma no gyoza (\u00a37.30) - filled with beef, ginger and sesame dumplings- Gindara to kani no gyoza (\u00a312.90) - filled with black cod, crab and crayfish dumplingsAs well as ordering a variety of hot dishes, we tried some of \u00a0the sushi at Roka. We had two plates of sushi with a mix of maki rolls and nigiri. I thought it was nice quality sushi but the size of the nirigi seem to be smaller than what you might get at most Japanaese restaurant.We also ordered the Kani no Kamameshi- rice hot pot with crab and wasabi tobiko. The texture reminded me of congee which is a name for Chinese congee. The portion of the hot pot is not big and probably enough for one or two people. We shared it between eight person as a taster portion and gave us about one or two tablespoons each.Mine and every ones favourite dish had to be the dessert platter. It was actually the one dish I wanted to have in the reason to visit Roka. Variety of dessert served on a boat which made it the best looking dessert I have seen so far, and the most expensive dessert I have had.Roka does serves tasty food but it is expensive. I would only recommend to go over there is you do have the cash to splash, there is any offers (let me know if there is!) or for a special occasion (like me!).",

Highly popular and undoubtedly exceptional with the price to easily tag along for tapas style portions this place was lively, energetic, and pricey. A plus for me was it was open late in an area that shuts down relatively early. My King Crab rice pot was excellent, flavorful, and filling and the presentation was excellent. I sat at the sushi bar but it really seemed like a kitchen in the middle of the action and it was filled with action with the chefs calling out orders and sous chefs acknowledging them. The presentation of all meals was superb and that should be rated 5 stars . I was anxious to be fed after a long day and my standards were closing. My food was excellent but in my haste I didn't check prices. I'm not sure I was dressed correctly for this trendy spot but I walked in like a king and received good service.",

This would easily be a five star review except our server was a bit too cold and unfriendly, but that didn't detract much from the meal. Most of the items you order are from the robata grill or from the sushi bar and you can't go wrong with selections from either place. Every single item we ordered was fantastic. That's pretty rare especially since we ordered about a dozen items. Food recommendations:Black cod and crab gyoza: Didn't expect to taste full cod and crab flavors in each bite, but both flavors came through. Excellent!Hamachi Maki: Tasty, but pretty standard. Sashimi Botan Ebi: Raw shrimp have a very particular flavor that you might not like, but these were fresh and topped with caviar. Almost $10 for each shrimp, so definitely pricey!Grilled scallop: Seared scallops are good, but these grilled scallops were unexpectedly wonderful.Grilled sea bream: Not sure what to expect, but another excellent grilled item. Salmon sashimi: Standard fresh sashimi. Yellowtail tartare: One of our favoritesIf you want a high energy restaurant with excellent sushi and asian entrees, this is the place for you. Highly recommended!Total cost was about \u00a3170 or $230, so plan for a pricey dinner, especially if you're drinking.",

Food:- salted edamame: 5/5- yellowtail sashimi with truffle: 5/5 amazing amazing amazing!!! I will be dreaming of this dish for years to come- o-toro (semi fatty tuna): 5/5- prawn tempura roll: 5/5- california roll: 4/5 just your average california roll- chicken skewers with spring onion: 5/5- beef filet: 5/5 extremely tender and flavourful- asparagus robata: 5/5- peanut/vanilla/chocolate sundae: 3/5 I probably won't order this again as the consistency of the chocolate is halfway between a heavy mousse and a gelato + stuck at the bottom of this jar? It felt like a random mish mash of a dessert.Service: 5/5 the waiters were all extremely attentive, constantly making sure we had enough water and getting all of our dishes, even though we were in the corner of the restaurant.Overall, I will definitely be coming back here (and hopefully sooooon)!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped here for our anniversary. We left feeling well taken care of :)Food - we got the premium tasting menu and it was delicious. The starter of yellow tail sashimi and truffle oil was super delicious. The truffle oil was subtle but very tasty. I ended up using some on my ginger that came with the sashimi platter and it was very different but so good. Another hit was the seafood dumplings. Very crispy on the skins and moist on the inside. They flavored it well so it tasted like it was pork/beef but the texture was of fish. The seafood was exceptionally good tonight as we went on to the Chilean sea bass over rice. The skin was extra crispy as they panfried it while they kept the inside well cooked.The dessert at the end was such a good way to end it. So many different fruits, 3 sherbets, a rocky road kind of ice cream and a short cake. Service was fair. The server was nice and they were attentive as well as on time for plate removal. The coat check in the front was a plus too!",
