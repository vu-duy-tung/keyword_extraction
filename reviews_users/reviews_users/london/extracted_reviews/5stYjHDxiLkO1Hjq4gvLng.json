It is a good place to go to for a quick decent meal - perfect for busy people who are always on the go. It is decked out with large wooden communal tables and always filled with people. The menu is a range of noodles, curries, vegetable and rice dishes. I come here for a big bowl of their noodle soup. They do a Tom yam variety which is tangy and hot. The food comes in generous portions, and the prices are very agreeable. Staff, though friendly, can be almost to hasty at times, making one feel rushed. But that's very much an Asian quality, and I don't mind it.",

The food is good, finding your usual thai currys meat and fish, and my favourite drink, guava collins. Food normally comes speedily. I have eaten here on numerous occassions and seem to ecperience the same staff mistakes each time! the large tables seem to through some of the workers. You can expect them trying to offer you dishes that you have not ordered. I have also on a couple of occassions found receipt and change set down infront of me before i have even paid! they are trying to give me food and money! Although the staff are friendly, when going to place an order I have been advised against what i wanted to eat, to the point of being pushy! A great place to fill up, not really a place to linger in though. Can get very busy in the evenings.",

    "text": "When ordering, I opted for the Green Curry Rice with Grilled Chicken, with some Thai Roti on the side (I love bread products - sue me). This invoked the ire of our waitress. 'You know it's spicy?' she enquired in a cute little patronising tone. Gee, thanks. Don't you realise that nowadays, at least in London, Thai is the new Indian? I guarantee you that everyone in that restaurant would have eaten Thai before. But anyway, she then went on to tell me I shouldn't order the roti because my meal would be 'dry'. I ignored her because nothing annoys me more than being policed on my food choices by staff. My Chinese foodie friend, who ordered Pad Thai, was spared from any critiquing about her menu choices. As the restaurant started filling up to the brim around us, our food arrived. And my lord, it almost made up for the crappy service we were being subjected to. My 'dry dish' was in fact swimming in a beautiful green curry sauce, with a rice tower and darkly grilled chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly; juicy inside, but with a crunchy skin, just how I like it. The rice seemed almost to be coated lightly in curry sauce, but without being turned into a swimming mess. And the sauce, well the sauce itself was a delight. Not one of those curry sauces which make your eyes water from the first bite, the flavour built up from pleasant and 'not spicy at all' to having a bit more kick near the end. It was delicious. The Thai Roti were puffed up, doughy and greasy - perfect for using to scoop flavour-filled rice into ones mouth. My friends Pad Thai appeared to be everything a Pad Thai should be. There were no complaints from my friend, and she ate her entire plate, which is unusual for this slow (super slow) eater. It is worth noting that when our portions first came out we both thought they looked dainty and fairly small portioned, but in fact,we could scarce cram our last mouthfuls in). Once done, and feeling pleasantly hazy in that post-food way, it was not long until we were dropped down to earth with a unceremonious bill. We tried to leave it, as we still had drinks to finish, but the waitress came back over and asked how we were going to pay, leaving us to be forced out with drinks half drunk. Overall, Busaba has pissed me off a bit. It is not hard to run a upmarket fast food restaurant whilst still having good service. I may be banging on about Wagamamas, but that is because both these places have the same idea. Exotic food, served fast, (but not McDonalds fast), communal seating and a certain speed of eating expected. However, I have never felt rushed or harassed by staff at a Wagamamas. I have been on dates to Wagamamas, and ate with friends, where we have lingered a little longer, and the staff have never made us feel pressured, even with people queuing out the door. Busaba on the other hand, made us feel unwelcome right from the start. This is a huge shame, because the food at Busaba was so good, and reasonably priced. I would go back to another branch of Basaba's, but I will not bother going back to this one, which is a shame.",

It is a little bit Wagamama stylee, as in different groups of people sit around the same tables. Sometimes it annoys me in Wagamama, but I quite liked it here. The food was really nice, they accidentally gave us more than what we ordered and didn't charge us, oops I think they deserve an extra star for that though! Like pigs, we ordered way more than what we could eat, but it was only because everything was so tempting! It was nice because we shared each other's food and that worked really well because we got to taste quite a bit of the menu. I love thai curry anyway, but it was yummy here, as was the squid! Yum",

I can't remember the names of the stuff we ordered b/c he ordered for us, but there was a papaya salad and a prawn shrimp and these chickeny things that were wrapped in palm leaves and something called jungle curry. \u00a0Thank god he ordered b/c I looked at the menu and EVERYTHING looked delicious, so I don't think i would have been able to make any decisions.I think I saw that they are opening up another one in Hoxton and you can bet that I am going there a lot.",

The room is filled with large square communal tables and you get seated wherever there is availability. The server was friendly and came by pretty quick to take our orders and bring us water. Since they didn't have Pad See Ew, I order the Pad Thai with green mangoes and crab meat. The food came out on a large plate looking and smelling delicious. The taste did not disappoint! I've eaten at a lot of Thai places in SF and NY and this dish rivaled their best! The noodles were cooked well and very flavorful. The crab and green mango were great additions and enhanced the original dish. The two other noodle plates my friends ordered were also really tasty. The only disappointing dish was my other friend's noodle soup dish. The bland soup came in a tiny bowl and barely had any seafood on it. My recommendation - order the noodle dishes!",

That would have been fine if it was just a long line, but since it is communal seating they kept taking two people and the line must have cycled through twice before they seated us. Again, this could have been understood if they at least looked apologetic but my queries were rebuffed with disdain, not a good way to build customer loyalty!However, for the price, the food is worth a trip. The calamari is a great pick, fresh and crunchy with a bit of a bite from the chilli. The coconut rice was perfectly cooked, just on the right side of al dente and sweet without being overwhelmingly so. I had some sort of chilli beef dish which was full of flavour. I would have preferred more sauce for the simple reason that it was so delicious I would have kept eating it with rice all night. The acidity of the home made lemonade added a nice counterbalance to the richness of the sauce.Overall, I'll go back in a small group of 2-3 but it's not worth the aggravation of trying to land a larger party.",

The place seemed distinctly large or I might have been suffering from a spatial illusion stroke. After being greeted with a fairly warm welcome, we were seated in the communal style tables, which I quite love.The food was very average. The chicken satay was abominable; chicken was rubbery, and the peanut sauce was anemic. Moment of Nirvana :--- You CAN go wrong with chicken satay!... so it wasn't just me, my fellow consumers didn't venture as near as more than a bite. The chicken satay should definitely go off the menu. Green curry; very average. Although I distinctly remember my licking my fingers after a thai curry at Busaba (Wardour St) a year ago.

So we landed at Busaba Eat Thai tucked behind Selfridges, rather less busy than her Wardour Street sister but no less delicious.

Chicken wrapped in pandan leaves, creamy green curry, perfectly seasoned pad thai, the list goes on and on.

    "text": "Wowza, this place sure seems to be all the rage. Each and every time I set up a meeting with someone from 'round these parts, Busaba Eathai is suggested without fail. \u00a0My feelings? Sure, it's fine ... I guess. It's definitely not bad ... Really, it's fine. It's fine. Fine, ok? \u00a0 \u00a0Fine .. if that's what everyone wants ... I guess. (If you could see my face right now, you'd see scrunched up eyebrows, lips pursed off to one side and shoulders raised in defense ...in case one of the many 4 and 5 star reviewers come at me in a rage...) Maybe I'm spoiled to amazing thai food from living in the Northwest, (p.s. I love you Portland,) but nothing I've had here (on my 4 visits, mind you) has blown me away. I've yet to feel the spice kick from any dish, even when I've specifically asked for them to \"turn up the heat.\" But unlike others, I really dig the communal seating arrangements and my service has been beyond speedy each visit. My consensus: safe thai food for the masses. Which, to reiterate, is fine. I'm always down for some crowd pleasing favorites ... I guess.",

What I wasn't expecting was to be perched on a bench with a load of strangers but luckily the delicious food managed to outweigh the horrific service and uncomfortable seating arrangement.I had the chicken butternut squash stir-fry with cashew nuts and chili for \u00a35.70 with jasmine rice and a coke. By the time I tipped (which I so shouldn't have for the appalling service) it came to about \u00a313. The food was gorgeous, the chicken melted in my mouth and was perfectly filling. The waiters however threw the orders down at us rudely, and gave us all the wrong meals. Not even asking us once if we were ok, it was almost like a practical joke of how much rudeness can you bear. A lot apparently when the food is this good!",

    "text": "Busaba is a pretty nifty kind of place. I am partial to a spot of Thai cuisine and this place delivers the goods to an exceptional standard. The food is awesome the location and service is not so hot.The layout and decor of the restaurant is pretty swanky. The table are big square communal ones, much like an upmarket cafeteria, this works well if your in a twosome or lucky enough to get a table where everyone is friendly. However, this being London, the chances of that are slim, and in this particular venue, people seem more interested in thier Blackberry than the social going ons around them. Large group meals don't work so well here as your not allowed to book and the chance of getting a whole free square table is unlikely. They also offer window seating where you can sit and watch the world go by, well thats the idea, however this window looks onto a grey wall. Its ok if you have a good imagination.Busaba is very much you eat you leave, which is fine for a working woman or a man on a mission but please do not go here expecting to take your time over a meal. You will be harrassed by the staff who ask if you would like anything else on an avaerage of 5 minutes. \"Yes ok, we get the message\". The staff are pleasent, and I believe just doing there job as they are probably told more covers = more tips = get as many people in and out as possible. Unlike the Wardour St branch, I have never seen this restaurant full and it has a much more business like feel to it.All that aside the food is outstanding, I recommend the Thai Green Curry or Sen Chun Phad Thai both are delicious and reasonably priced. I believe the curry is just under \u00a38 and the Phad Thai \u00a311, you would be hard pushed to spend alot of money here \u00a320 can easily cover your food and drink. May I also suggest, for those with a small appetite or on a budget, a side of Thai Calamari and Jasmine Rice, so simple and less than \u00a35 and plenty of food. In fact, alot of the side dishes match the mains. I would urge any good foodie to try this place just bare in mind you won't be hanging around for long.",

Great lighting - low enough to be complimentary and mood enhancing, but good enough to see what you're eating.And what you're eating is pretty impressive, considering BE is a chain. I've been to one of the other branches in Soho and the food didn't compare with this. This is really decent cooking. Not perfect but good enough to find yourself thinking about it the next day and planning a return visit.Thai calamari (why oh why they felt the need to use 'calamari' I'll never know - squid would have been fine, after all, it's not a Thai/Greek restaurant) was good but a little over-cooked. Mango & chilli salad was fab - fresh, lime zesty and tangy with enough chilli to wake up the senses but not overpower them.Satay chicken was seriously good. The thigh meat was incredibly succulent and moist - much tastier than breast in my opinion - and cooked to perfection. The lamb curry (similar to a Massaman) was to die for. Th lamb was delicate and perfectly tender, next to big chunks of potato in a rich, creamy sauce that had a gentle kick. Sticky rice was way too sticky - think they'd overdone it - but underneath the curry sauce, it got away with it.Another visit very soon I suspect.",

Thai noodles and curry dishes at around \u00a37-8, and starters around \u00a34-5. Nothing really special in my mind. I had the tom yam talay, expecting a very fiery and sour tom yam soup that is clear. Instead, I got a coconut cloudy soup base, with just a hint of sourness, and no spiciness at all. Major disappointment. I ordered the chicken satay as well. Chicken satay is typically thin strips of meat on a stick that has been grilled. Busaba Eathai's satay were big chunks of breast meat. Definitely not authentic at all - and it ruins the taste of satay as its not about the meat itself, but about the marinade flavours and the smokiness from the grill, plus the meat used is normally fatter than lean breast meat. Overall - go here if you're just looking to fill your belly while shopping Oxford Street, and craving for some Thai food. The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",

First time round (at the Wardour St. branch), I would have definitely given it four stars and possibly even five based on flavour, decor and value for money, but I was quite disappointed with this trip. It was Saturday night and pretty packed so perhaps I should let them away with the slip ups but we were served raw chicken which is hard to forgive. It was the chicken satay starter and it was very pink and cold on the inside! Apparently, the size of the chicken chunks have changed so the cooks must have mixed up the timing, but still...The dish was discounted from the bill but it would have taken a little more than that for me to forget about the incident. There was also a faff with drinks being added to the bill that we hadn't ordered but I guess that can happen with those big shared tables. I am a big fan of the big shared tables and the decor in general. The food (when cooked) is very tasty too, my ginger beef main contested to this fact. Those eating with me also thoroughly enjoyed their curries (red lamb and green chicken) and chargrilled beef.I will return soon to see if to update this review and be able to give it more stars (here's hoping!) or if things go badly, reduce to a sad one star...c*",

The place is qutie big with a lot of big square tables in the middle and some seats next to the window...you might end up sharing the table with other groups, that sometimes is quite funny...My favourite stuff are the fried prawns (delicious), the traditional pad thai (very big portion) and the meat fillet in soy sauce (forgot the name, but it is very good). Wine list is okayish, not very prestigious wines but possible to order a glass only of decent wine for a limited price.Not 5 stars because of the queue at the door that can be quite long over the weekend and the impossibility to book. Staff is nice (many of which are Italians!)",

    "text": "Let's take it from the top. Queue: 20 people. That's normal. And they've thought about it. There's a loooong corridor where you stand. It's decorated, and kept warm, so waiting is not unpleasant at all. Time to sit down: 5 min. I was surprised! Mind you, it's very easy to get a seat if you're 2 people, it's the 3+ that starts to be a challenge. Still, they give you menus while you're in the queue to speed things up, and watching the floating candles and flowers keeps you zen anyway. Time to order: 5min. Waiters are quite eager... Time for food to come: 20min. Started getting bored, but then all the food came at once! They don't bother with starters and things, everything comes at the same time and you dive in. YUM! Food is delicious, service generally quick if not always fluent in english, and the ambience lovely, especially if, like me, you are trying to escape valentine's coupledom dominion of cheesiness. The great big square tables of 10 people each form a lovely space on which we can lay out many dishes, and talk to each other and eavesdrop on other conversations. The wooden decor and low-hanging just-bright-enough lamps cast a flattering glow on the food and patrons. The food is delicious (you have GOT to try the prawns under the \"sides\" heading) and I had to order me more. Originally I was scared as 90% of the dishes are either vegetarian (boring) or spicy (uh oh...). I went with spicy, preferring to risk a burn rather than forego meat, and was pleasantly surprised! Yes, it was spicy, but it was perfectly tolerable even for my low tolerance palate. So I was happy. My plan is to head back there with a group of 10 friends and take over an entire table to ourselves, having a crazy dinner on an otherwise boring evening. Tip: It's on Oxford Street, just past Bond Street station, behind the GAP. Keep walking north, it's on the left hand side.",

The food has always been absolutely delicious. It's even hard to choose a favourite! The Bangkok King Prawn dish is amazing. It's a dry yellow curry that goes really well with rice and has incredible flavour. The Tom Yam Gong soup is also bursting with lemongrass and curry flavours. And their classic pad thai is the best I've ever had. I usually don't like pad thai because I find most of them too dry and too peanut-y. This one is moist and has nice hints of lemongrass and citrus. Amaaaaazing. I would always order the phad phak. It's just a small side of vegetables but the sauce they cook it in is seriously out of this world. It's sweet but savoury and compliments the veggies very well. It think the only thing I've had from here that wasn't crazy about was the chilli prawn fried rice. It didn't stand out to me. But who cares! That leaves so many more options! yayayayaya",

Last time my meal was delivered in reverse; main, then entree, prawn crackers and then drink.Today we had two booked tables (separate bills) on a not too busy day. We ordered with the Manager on a table of 9. There was a mixture of menu and express menu items, but it took 50 minutes for the last order to arrive. The menu items (4) came first at 40 minutes, and then (4) express items 5 minutes later. My express menu meal came a further 5 minutes later. It was supposed to be Crispy Duck Noodles. What I got looked more like noodle vomit. The duck was warm, but the noodles looked like they had sat in cold water for too long and had started to break down. The noodles were cold and soggy with sparsely dispersed small chunks of hot duck meat. I sent it back to the kitchen where it was heated up, and returned to me. Google the meal and compare it to what I received.No apology for the tardy service. Half the mains were served before the entree arrived. Drinks took a long time to arrive. Water jugs took even longer to be replaced. Prawn cracks that were ordered but never arrived (not charged to the bill). Yet they still wanted to charge for my meal?!? And a service charge!!!I couldn't give anything lower than 1 star, which is a shame cos I'd give no stars at all!",

We ordered the calamari, pad thai, and fish curry dishes. We aren't into spicy so got mild for both mains. We got the pad thai and fish curry first. Mmm. They use thin noodles for the pad thai which was awesome. So delicious and not drenched in sauce like many Asian fusion places I've tried. The fish curry was also very delicious, so soft and well paired with the curry. They brought the calamari as a side rather than as an app for some reason, but it was also quite delicious - a decently large portion, too. Top notch Thai food, a bit on the expensive side, though I'd love to come back here again.",

Probably the best thai place I've eaten in London. I swear all ethnic food is a bit rubbish! But I was so glad I stumbled upon this spot between Oxford street shopping. The first time, I decided to get a noodle dish; my favorite is pad thai or pad see ew, but I saw they had this starred version - which included crab meat. Obviously, it was clear to me to splurge. I went home and was pleasantly surprised that the noodle was a good consistencies, the spice was a good level and had plenty of shrimp and tofu! (not so much crab meat, but that was expected)My second encounter was last night, I was famished from shopping. I was looking forward to eating this in the comfort of my home tonight so I decided to order more (and for 1 - lonely, I know). I got the regular pad thai and green curry + rice. The pad thai was the biggest disappointment, it wasn't spicy at all! Complete 180 from last week's dish. I was scrambling to see if I had any hot sauce in the hotel cuz it was soooo bland. Secondly, the green curry didn't have much substance. It had very little corn and peas - I'm used to the regular bamboo shoots, bell peppers version. It was bad, but definitely did not give enough rice for how thick the curry was. The spice level was medium, but it definitely lacked vegetables or something to add to the dish. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed that I wasted stomach space for this. Definitely try something new next time.",

The layout is communal eating so if it's busy, you'll be sharing a table with others, unless you have a group big enough for your own table (probably around 8). It's got a ethnic feel to the decorations inside with lots of dark wood and Thai statues around. There is a good selection of food on the menu covering all the traditional favourites plus a few \"specials\". We went for the pad thai and the north Thai Laksa - that I wouldn't normally associate with Thai but it was actually really good!.There's an abundance of staff that are always on the look out for how they can help and therefore all very friendly.

    "text": "This place focuses on looks more than the food. At least by stir fry beef was tougher than I am and the sauce in my wife's stir fry prawns left a lot to be desired. I left hungry, not willing to order something more from the overpriced-compared-to-the-quality menu. And while I get that not everyone need to serve cider, the fact that the waiter does not even know what it is or that she did not bother to ask if we wanted more water with a clearly empty bottle on the table, the service was negatively surprising and left an overall bad taste.",

I was craving Asian food and the tube was slammed so we opted to come here bc it was close. Bad idea. The service is HORRIBLE. You have to yell to talk to the person next to you. ALWAYS asking for water, wtf! I shouldn't have to ask for water 4x and the last time I asked for water and the check as well, the waiter I guess decided to not bring it bc I had asked for the check as well. If you're going to do the communal table, then they need to break into sections. There are way too many people for the service to be this shitty. The food wasn't even ok. The saving grace was the tom yum soup. This spot is definitely not worth it and I regret not attempting the crowd for something else.",
