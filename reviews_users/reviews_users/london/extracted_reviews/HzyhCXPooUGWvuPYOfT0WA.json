    "text": "Gasp!! Gourmet Vegetarian food that even carnivores are satisfied by? Tasty veggie delights that your tongue will treasure for weeks to come? Vanilla Black is out-of-the-way in Chancery Lane, but only 3 mins walk from the tube - a blessing if you're bored with fighting through Soho and fancy a change. This destinational eaterie is a heavenly escape from the usual bland veggie options that I've become resigned to. What an incredibly decadent way to spend a gastronomic evening. At \u00a324 for 2 courses, and \u00a330 for 3 (lunch costs less), we felt ultra-satisfied and full to bursting after eating as much from the menu as possible (in the spirit of reviewing, of course). This is what we chose: after an amuse bouche, we started with the deconstructed puy lentil dahl with potato puree and curry oil, and the Black Olive and Saffron Potato with Almond Muesli and tomato paste. Mains were Hickory-Smoked Duck Egg and Caerphilly Pudding, and Parsley and Mushroom Duxelle Mille Feuille - as for dessert, Carrot Cake with Orange Sorbet and sugared coriander and the Chocolate Parfait with passion fruit sorbet and crystallised pineapple was an incredible ending. Trust me, you won't notice the lack of flesh on the plate. Oh yes, these people definitely know what they're doing - Vanilla Black used to be based in York until very recently; I ate there a year ago and fantastised about Donna and Andy bringing their place to London since that meal who knew my dream would come true? This place has only been open for 3 weeks or so (time of writing May 2008) - I'd get in quick before people start plastering Michelin stars all over it.",

    "text": "Here's the thing: I tend to get anxious if there's a meal without meat in it. Meat is BRILLIANT. Just not, it turns out, as brilliant as a meal at Vanilla Black. Ghastly earth motherish decor aside (taupe? Beige? AND grey?) it's startlingly special. Terrific staff, a knowledgeable sommelier and tip-top food. We had delicious amuse bouches (always a nice surprise) and then the most deliciously layered textures and tastes I've had in ages. We were so stuffed after starters and mains that we skipped pudding. That just doesn't happen normally. I've been trying to manhandle all my carnivorous chums along to try it out and while my suggestion has been greeted by a perfect display of synchronised outrage, I know that once I get them there, they'll see what all the fuss is about. Delicious. (And I am deducting a point for decor, it's a bit too earnest for such hummana hummana food action)",

The restaurant has lost some of it's ramshackle charm (everything matches now), and the decor is a restrained and sombre affair. However this is more than made up for by the wonderful staff and excellent food. Vanilla Black serve an adventurous and well presented vegetarian menu. Highlights include the 'Broad Bean Custard and Cheese & Onion VinaigretteLemon Thyme Shortbread and Leaves' and the 'Poached Duck Egg and Ribblesdale Pudding'. Both meals were packed full of absolutely wonderful flavours and textures - and the portion sizes were perfect too. I do miss the amazingly comforting 'cabbage and cheese pudding' they used to serve with a red wine sauce - perhaps that dish is not sophisticated enough for VB's new London location? Excellent value for money, great wine list, and very helpful staff. VB have got very little to improve on, and are demonstrating just how exciting vegetarian cuisine can be.",

After several miserable experiences (unforgivably miserable in the case of Modern Pantry) I was on the verge of giving up. I'd never heard of Vanilla Black until the arrival of a veggie mate set me searching. Boy, am I glad I found it. I completely agree with every word of the other reviews. This place does proper posh nosh. My veggie mate was in heaven and this little piggy (eater) wasn't far off. Staff were lovely, too. Criticisms? Enough with the Farrow and Ball grey already. It's dated, ubiquitous and downright depressing. However, I'm not about to deduct a star on account of the paintwork.",

The wine list is very good and matched superbly to the food on offer. The food itself is divine...in particular the deconstructed puy lentil dahl starter and the Hickory-Smoked Duck Egg and Caerphilly Pudding main. If there's one slightly duff note it's that the VB menu has hardly changed since it opened so a bit more variety wouldn't go amiss to make me keep coming back time and again. Overall perhaps the biggest compliment that can be paid to VB is that every single meat eater that has gone there with me has ended up going back!",

Service is excellent without being at all stuffy or over-formal, and the food is superb; I loved the savoury Wensleydale cheesecake starter and can't wait to come back and try more. A perfect choice for special occasions, and yes, do take your meat-eating friends along to change their minds on vegetarianism EDIT to say that after another superb visit, I have to also compliment the Vanilla Black team on their choice of music. Where else, besides your own home, could you enjoy delicious food and wine whilst listening to Pulp, The Pixies and the Smiths!?",

    "text": "Worst restaurant experience ever. I was in town for work with a colleague and saw this place on Happy Cow so we decided to check it out. When we arrived it was 6pm on a Wednesday and only 1 other party was there. They asked if we had a reservation, we said no. (Not realizing we needed one.) The bitchy hostess snapped that we needed a reservation, as if how dare we enter their large empty restaurant without one. We said \"fine, we can go some place else.\" The hostess said \"well, if you can eat quickly I suppose we can fit you in.\" We only stayed because the menu looked good.Once seated we asked the server which items on the menu were vegan. He angrily snapped that \"THIS IS WHY WE INSIST YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS! WE ARE A VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT, NOT VEGAN!\" \u00a0I wanted to throw my drink at him. Also, they had vegan items on the menu. He just wanted to make us feel as uncomfortable as possible. When our food came we found the vegetables bland and over cooked. Who the hell boils carrots and cabbage, any way? It was disgusting. It was also so unbelievably scalding hot that both myself and my colleague severely burned our mouths on the food. I was so embarrassed for having suggested this nightmare of a restaurant. Also it stayed empty the entie time we were in there, so clearly there was no need for them to be so damn rude about their reservation policy.If you're vegetarian in London, go to Saf. The service is good and the food is exceptional.",

    "text": "I ate at Vanilla Black with a couple of friends. \u00a0The standard menu was \u00a324 for two courses and \u00a330 for 3. \u00a0Two of us opted for 3 course and one for 2 courses and we had a bottle of wine, a couple of beers and coffee to finish and the bill came out at \u00a3126 including the 12.5% tip that apparently goes straight to the staff. I didn't check the tipping situation with the staff so I don't know if the tips go directly to the staff or it is used to help make their wages but as the law changes on this in a couple of months time in favour of the staff I'll let it go this time.Food was excellent and delicious - nice to eat interesting dishes without a meat or fish base. \u00a0I had a starter of Candied Chilli Stuffed Black Olives and Lemon and Avocado Cream which was light and had some pazzaz followed by truffled potato that was okay and finished with a Lemon Meringe 'Pie' and Whipped Cream with Coriander Pur\u00e9e that was somewhat deconstructed - their term that meant it wasn't like ordinary Lemon Meringe 'Pie' hence the quotation marks.I'll have to work out how to do the Coriander Pur\u00e9e for my own deserts - a wonderful idea.The wine was a Temparinollo for \u00a315.50 that was good and very reasonable and the coffee at the end that I don't think that they charged for.As an introduction and 'to clear our pallets' we were given a tomato juice with celery and an assortment of flavours that was very nice but I felt that the meal lacked these pallet cleansers as that was the only one that we were given \u00a0- a couple more through the meal would of not gone amiss and raised the stakes on this restaurant no end.Staff were v good, none of the fussing and continual pouring of wine that is often so irritating so top marks on waiting staff.A funny little witticism to finish this review in line with most other Yelp reviews is being prepared as you read this and will be edited in later once it has been honed to perfection.PS this restaurant is just off of Chancery Lane and everybody else except my table were in suits - I was under-dressed - thank god I was not in shorts and sandals nor my motor bike gear - dress well if you decide to eat here",

The last time I was forced into such a place was in New York where I ended up eating \"nut cheese\", which is actually even slightly less delicious than it sounds. None of that nonsense here - I was blown away by the food. I had what was basically mashed potato to start with, but it had cheese, caramelized onions and garlic micro leaves in it and was bowl lickingly lovely. My friends had the carrot cake with yoghurt and ginger, which was probably the most interesting starter I have had in a long time! We also tried the Brie ice cream, that just didn't do it for me - too sharp for its texture.We all had the souffl\u00e9 for the main course, which was actually loads of different things on a plate - including a poached egg. It was delicious and I didn't miss the meat at all.Would I go back? Hmmm, it was great to try, but it is expensive and quite frankly, I fancy a big juicy steak....",

The beetroot and artichoke main simply swam head and shoulders about so many other similar main dishes I've had.Service: Very good. I was treated to a lovely sweet and fruity happy birthday dessert dish, and was sung to by the staff. So many times vegetarian places get short shrift.

    "text": "How much?: \u00a330 for three courses or \u00a324 for two courses Hidden away on a tiny cobbled street behind Holborn's bustle, Vanilla Black is a cultish vegetarian oasis more in the mould of laid back Michelin starred food emporia Arbutus than the often holier than thou High Veg of somewhere like Saf. There are no opinions shoved at you, and no ethos that you have to subscribe to, they just want to serve you good ingredients, cooked well, in a calm friendly atmosphere. That those ingredients happen to all be vegetables, seems a coincidence.This approach is unlike San Francisco's Ubuntu or New York's Dirt Candy, two other great, high end, vegetarian experiences this committed carnivore places in his top dining experiences of recent years. Both of them celebrate individual, specific veg in their dishes, with Ubuntu (where all of the food is grown within 20k of the kitchen) offering Cauliflower cooked four ways and a wonderful Carrot Gnocci and Dirt Candy (an all together grittier, East Village experience) presenting Corn, Mushroom and Pumpkin as the stars of their own dishes. I digress.One chatty server took pity on me while waiting for the Vole (once again...) The friendly staff are a contrast to their severe black uniforms but fit nicely in with the clean grey-green and white walls. When she finally arrived, we settled down in the quieter front section of the restaurant - the fact that someone called Dharma was enjoying their birthday revels in the rear section was the only hint of hippie that we saw all night - the rest of the clientele were smart, though not overly dressy and given it's location, there were more than a few suits floating through the celebratory groups.An amuse of 'fresh tomato with celery salt' was as nice a shot of Virgin Mary as I've had and a good palate cleanser. If I admit to not being overly impressed with a starter of Sweet & Sour Glazed Beetroot with Wasabi Cream it was only due to a severe food envy. This was suffered from my (single, solitary!) taste of The Vole's Puy Lentil Dhal braised in red wine and served with a potato puree, curry oil and a crunchy moorish spice mix - one of the best variants on a, quite frankly often plain, dish I've tasted.A perfectly subtle and lovely Ozzie gewurztraminer (from a little boutique producer in Clare Valley called Skillogalee if you're interested...) perfectly chimed with our mains. It was now The Vole's turn to suffer food envy. Her Asparagus and Chervil Pesto Crumpet with a leek tagliatelle was perfectly executed but my Ribblesdale cheese pudding was one of the tastiest dishes I've eaten this year. It arrived with a side of tart pineapple puree that seemed initially incongruous, but set off the creamy soft set cheese pudding perfectly. A dish of two halves, it came paired with a poached ducks egg sitting resplendent on a stout and expertly prepared smoked potato cake. The two worked together well. Too well for me to let the Vole have more than a morsel.If the deconstructed carrot cake I had to finish had a flaw, it was only in it's size. The elements all came together as expected, though the carrot 'halwa' was more of a puree. We were pretty much the last to leave at 10 and while the restaurant had been full during it's 8pm sitting, I definitely thought they could, and should, have been busier. Every now and then remember that it's not all about the steak or the burger and give Vanilla Black a go. You won't miss the meat (for a night anyway).",

    "text": "This is $$$ food. Rich and expensive.And obviously they paid someone a lot of money to sit and think hard about how to make dishes pop, visually both on the menu and on the plate, as well as in your mouth.It was hard to find the place, as it is tucked away on one of those London streets that even black cabs may find hard to reach. Once we were there though, we were given quite the warm welcome. Literally. Our server offered to turn the airconditioner off because she noticed I was cold.We decided to go with the 3 course menu. The watermelon strawberry shot with the black pepper studded turkish delight as the amuse bouche was quite nice, but I would have liked more heat or acidity in it. It's fine - can't complain about free food :)For the appetizer, I chose the cold poached duck egg simply because I have never eaten it before. It was well, a funny dish. Hard to say that I liked it, but it was surely the most unique egg preparation I have eaten. Served chilled, the yolk was the consistency of lemon curd and the white was a translucent jelly. I did like the touch of mustard oil in the dish.Let me take a moment here to talk about my husband's appetizer. The brie ice cream with some hazelnut crumble and some plum chutney. That ice cream, so creamy. That sauce, so tangy, that crumble, so crumbly. Just fabulous. This is the dish I dreamed about creating but never did.As usual, my husband had better luck with me in the main course, as he greedily lapped up his fried mushroom mousse. Now that's what you call umami - that mousse was simply perfect in texture and taste. The tarragon waffles, however, I could have done without. My dish was the warm celery panna cotta with the blue cheese profiteroles. Well conceived, but at that point I was just so full from eating all these rich dishes. That wasn't going to stop me from ordering dessert though. We shared the caramelised custard (a-okay) with this beautiful, beautiful, creamy bramble ice cream. I'm not the biggest fan of ice cream in fall but this was dreamy. And creamy.If I find myself back in London - I think I will surely go back to Vanilla Black for dinner - but I'll skip lunch and wear my stretchy pants, if they will let me.",

The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was nice - though a bit on the cold side. The food was very well presented, but I can't say I was overwhelmed by either flavour or creativity. Ok, but nothing to rave about. Also, after two courses I definitely still felt slightly hungry. Overall, I was slightly disappointed.I should also add that they have a separate vegan menu, which has a lot fewer options than the vegetarian one. They also clearly label themselves as a vegetarian restaurant, and you should let them know in advance if you're vegan - and I must say I find it slightly bizarre in itself that they make such a fuss about veganism when in this day and age it really shouldn't be a big deal to cook delicious, creative vegan food (especially not for a vegetarian restaurant). \u00a0Why they don't have vegan options available as part of the standard menu is beyond me, frankly.",

I found the dishes at Vanilla Black to be less inventive and less flavourful than the dishes at The Gate. I also thought that menu at Vanilla Black was leaning towards fussy. The ambiance definitely left something to be desired as well, and the layout of the place is sort of bizarre. My husband described the restaurant as feeling somewhat like a dentist's waiting room, and it definitely feels sterile and lacks a certain warmth. I realize this review is something of a comparison rather than a strict review of Vanilla Black, but it is inevitable that one would compare Vanilla Black to The Gate. In my opinion, Vanilla Black just didn't stack up.",

We were delighted to stumble on Vanilla Black online, confirmed they had a table for us over the phone, and a short tube ride later we were at the restaurant. Outstanding food and service followed and we were particularly impressed by the artichoke starter and the baked high cross (cheese) and barley mains. We were tired and didn't stay for dessert but the G&T and glass of white were both easily equal to the food. The acoustics in the restaurant are not good (there are actually accoustic baffles on the walls which are built into the structure) so, as with some other reviewers, we found it hard to hear how some of the staff were describing the food as it arrived. The food is so good that it's a shame the description of the dishes can't be heard with perfect clarity. Also, they serve their bottled water at room temperature. I'm sure that would suit some people but we had to ask for ice. Not a great hardship.",

I would only come back for the desert and our server ... can't recollect her name .... was fabulous. She had short hair and had started recently. Had expected much better but was a tad bit disappointed. Everything was fried in some form or another.",

If you want value for money, don't go there. 90 pounds for 2 people, sharing 1 dessert and we didn't order wine. So, you get the picture. The dessert was delicious, I think that saved the night. But in all, I would not come back. The service was good, and the ambience is very nice and intimate.",

From the moment my husband and I walked in, the two wonderful ladies that greeted us were so gracious and kind. The restaurant is cozy, romantic and beautifully designed. Our waitress Lenanita (AKA Lena ) was wonderful and so enthusiastic about our experience of what we were about to order. She explained every detail about each Starter, Main and Dessert with so much love for food. We walked out of Vanilla Black two hours later just blown away by what we had just experienced. Completely worth coming to this out of the way GEM of restaurant in London.",

Some of the combinations of flavors were very surprising to me and I appreciated the creativity of the dishes.Dinner here was definitely one of the top culinary highlights of my recent trip to London (and to the greater UK for that matter). I plan on recommending it to others when they visit.",

I should say that I really enjoyed their vegan options, particularly the mushroom dish and rhubarb dessert. The wine (which is clearly labeled as vegan and non-vegan wine) was very good. Customer service was excellent and very professional.",

Not vegan, admittedly, but I don't eat fish or chicken as well as the other usual suspects. So... I cried when I sat down and opened the menu. I honestly cried. I don't think I've ever opened a menu that was as creative, as promising, as filled with variety and imagination. Everything about this experience exceeded all expectations.It was fun to find... a little difficult. Thank you GPS. The service was impeccable. The food was extraordinary.Thank you. Thank you.

    "text": "This place really is a little gem. For haute cuisine, one can't go wrong in checking this place out. Yes, it's vegetarian but that's not what it's all about. The clientele all seemed well-heeled, intelligent people, and I have to say my date and I fit right in ;) \u00a0The flavours were incredible and I really appreciated that the portions were delicately sized, so I could try everything. I particularly enjoyed the foraged samphire and pickled potatoes - but the Ribblesdale pudding was the stand out. Apart from being just fun to say (Ribblesdale!) it was an unusual yet delicate take on a cheese souffle, served with the yummiest relish.I was chuffed anyway that my date picked a veggie restaurant, and then for it to be this impressive, was just the cherry on the cake :D",

    "text": "This is an outstanding vegetarian restaurant, proof that vegetarian food can be very creative, tasty and upscale. The location of the restaurant is odd and it took a little bit of effort to find it. The restaurant itself is quite understated and I wish there were just a little bit more character. However, what the restaurant lacks in charm, it more than makes up with delicious food. For starter, I had the Brie Ice Cream and Poached Blackberries. It was simply amazing! Needless to say the ice cream form brie brought a cool surprise and a different type of creamy texture than what you are used to when eating brie. I could eat this starter everyday! For main, I had the Roast Salsify, Jerusalem Artichokes and Iced Verbena. It was not only delicious, but satisfying. And for dessert, it was Milk Chocolate and Walnut Oil Pate with Avocado Ice Cream for me. I liked it overall, but I thought I'd love the avocado ice cream, but it didn't have as strong of a flavor as I had hoped for. The plating of each dish was beautiful and I really appreciate the effort. For such a wonderful 3-course meal, it was only 39.5 pounds, which was a bargain. They also have vegan options. Even if you are not a vegetarian, this restaurant is worthy of a visit, because the food is simply good.",

We're talking flavour combinations that shouldn't be possible - but taste delicious. Textures, temperatures, colours that are perfectly combined to have you perplexing over ever mouthful trying to work out what is going on on your tongue. One desert we shared paired espresso, sweet potato and blue cheese - separately these elements belong more on a savoury plate than a pudding but combined together... they rewrite the rule book for what does and doesn't make a desert. I've eaten here twice and it one of my favourite places in London for a more special dinner. Go for three courses, they're all pretty light and both starters and deserts are equally incredible.",
