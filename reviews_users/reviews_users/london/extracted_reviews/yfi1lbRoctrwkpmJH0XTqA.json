We had the deep fried squid, grilled sardines, and char siu duck bun. Both of us ordered a passion fruit cocktail which turned out to be light and fruity with a perfect amount of vodka for an early dinner. The ambiance is great in the Tapas room. If you manage to get one of the three outdoors table, you'll get to enjoy the people watching on Marylebone High Street also.",

    "text": "What a lovely brunch experience! I was able to book online, they called me to confirm and were sweet and accommodating when I asked to change my reservation time. The space is a bit small and tightly packed, but pretty and clean.The menu is available on their website and the portion sizes were perfect. My companion got the chorizo and sweet potato dish (ordering, to my mild embarrassment, his poached egg hard boiled) and I got the french toast stuffed with bananas and walnuts, which was soft but not soggy and drizzled with a generous amount of verjus syrup. It came with a little more bacon than I wanted, but who can complain about EXTRA bacon?!We want to return to try the turkish eggs, the exciting smoothies (baobab? tamarillo? yeahhh!), and the dessert menu--we saw some pretty desserts come through but didn't have room for any! Anyway, beautiful and delicious food in a fancy schmancy atmosphere for...a pretty freaking reasonable price. Approved even by the picky eaters in my life.",

    "text": "Again with the tapas - I'm starting to worry about all the cured meats and cheeses I'm consuming. \u00a0But I think of Providores more as a wine bar than a tapas restaurant. \u00a0It's also great for people watching thanks to the large communal tables. \u00a0The other night there was a man who arrived alone and parked himself on one of the stools right in the middle of the action. \u00a0He confided that while he didn't like eating alone, he enjoyed going to Providores by himself when he's in town on business because of the buzzing friendly atmosphere that makes it comfortable for everyone. Things I love about Providores:*you rarely have to wait more than 30 minutes for a spot at the wine bar*they have great New Zealand wine by the glass*the service is never rushed - it's a great place to go with a friend or a first dateMy only caution is that it doesn't take reservations (downstairs at least) and the portion sizes are pretty small. \u00a0An order of spring rolls is two small pieces. \u00a0So you're better off going with the tapas samplers or a random smattering of appetizers than trying to do a full meal.",

However, it meant I was able to have a starter, main and dessert with finishing every course and loving it!I had the sweet potato and miso dumplings which were divine, the NZ lamb which I ordered medium and came a little under-cooked for my liking, but I sent it back with no problems and when it came back out it was beautiful and then the dessert - which I struggled to order because they all looked fantastic.I would highly recommend trying the Kiwi Dream cocktail - it was so refreshing!The service was great and the tables were sufficiently spaced so that you didnt feel you were sitting on top of the people next door.",

    "text": "I always seem to find myself sitting at the high tables in the midst of this busy Marylebone restaurant. It's cosy, intimate, and quite easy to be bumped by either the waiters and waitresses or other diners leaving or arriving at the other small set of tables. Fortunately they also have a dining room upstairs (that I would hope would be roomier) and that you can book for in advance (unlike downstairs). The high tables are a reasonable use of the otherwise difficult-to-use space and adds to the bustling atmosphere many seem to come here for. The few other times I've been before, waiting to be seated is the usual norm, so I was surprised to find today that we didn't have to wait what so ever. We started with a set of strong coffees (myself, a flat white), whilst we perused their unique gastronomic offerings on the menu. As mentioned above, they have almost too many interesting choices or twists on classic brunch dishes, yet not too many to leave the diner confused and bewildered. I love poached eggs and decided to settle on the salmon dish CaribQueen mentioned above. It's an especially decadent dish, with the strong flavours of the smoked salmon strongly contrasted against the sharp yuzu-flavoured hollandaise. I still don't think the walnut bread goes too well with this, and could really have been substituted with any other bread as I certainly don't think it added much to the overall flavour of the dish. Either way, we left this place completely satisfied and am still aching to return here to try their non breakfast menu.",

Don't expect typical Spanish tapas, no sir, what they serve is a variety of fusion and flavors, where east meets west and beyond.

I highly recommend the Tamarind and coconut laksa with green tea noodles and crispy shallots. \u00a0They have a great selection of New Zeland wines, for all you wine connoisseurs, I'm sure it will please your palate.

    "text": "Ah, breakfast culture. When did we Brits lose it? You go anywhere else in the world and breakfast, or at least that pre-work cup of coffee at the bar, is an essential part of life. Paris, New York, Berlin, Eastern Europe, Spain, Australia, New Zealand they all understand the role that cafe culture has to play. London / the Uk though? We've struggled. Sure, you've always been sorted if you fancy a greasy spoon fry-up or a sausage-sandwich-of-indeterminable-origin but quality breakfasts? You've had to look long and hard for those. Things are improving though. Over the last few years, the joys of the weekend brunch are easier to find and many places provide decent weekday offerings too. Typically, the best in London are of Antipodean origin: Lantana, and The Providores. Of the two, I'd tip Providores slightly higher. The wine list - not that you want one with brekkie, of course - is excellent, the setting is simple and funky and buzzing, and the food - particularly the Turkish Eggs (natural yoghurt, chilli butter, poached eggs) and toasted sourdough - is first rate and creative. Lunch and dinner is also a good value, great tasting bet. You'll know when London is the best city in the world because there will be a Providores-style cafe in every Borough. Until then, it's worth the trawl to Marylebone.",

I'm not sure I'll be coming back to be honest - maybe if it were in my neighborhood, but I would even say that there are places closer to me that are better value for price.",

The ambience is reminiscent of a Spanish Tapas house in Madrid (aptly named) and the room seats around 10 sit down tables for 2, and the rest shared on high-tables. The menu is delicious. There are some pretty interesting choices available too - like the brown rice porridge, granola and the turkish eggs. This doesn't stop at the food - there are a range of absolutely delicious fruit juices available. This is also a nice after-dinner place with some very cool cakes and tea - including a mulberry tea which is particularly unique. Always busy, this is one of the best places to be on Marylebone High Street!",

    "text": "I've been to The Providores many times - for brunch and dinner - and it is one of my favorite places in London. Brunch: The Turkish eggs are to die for - and a unique way to do brunch. The chorizo is also always good. If you prefer sweet, then definitely do the French toast or crepes (depending on the time of year). Dinner: Go for risotto or lamb. The seafood is ok, but I'd skip it in favor of heartier options. Dinner is less tapas style than brunch, so you can expect full plates. I haven't had dessert there but it always looks really yummy!Atmosphere: The place is small and they pack you in pretty tight. On the bottom floor, you can be seated at the main table (high stools) with others right beside you). You can also be seated in the window, which is kind of nice (and can be done alone with a newspaper!). For upstairs, you can make reservations for larger parties, which is nice for birthday parties / events. I took my parents here when they were visiting and it was great to be upstairs because it isn't as loud and crowded. Lastly, get the latte/cappuccino no matter what meal you come for. The coffee is excellent and made with care!",

    "text": "Still not quite sure what to make of this place, even after having been there twice. Haven't yet tried the Tapa Room for anything besides brunch though, and its menu sounds really original and appetising.What I have tried: brunch in the Tapa Room. I really didn't like what I had. It was a savoury waffle with some kind of sauce which I can't quite remember except that it was just all a bit wrong and the wrongness was exacerbated by the involvement of sweetcorn. Oof. Did not like. The chorizo a couple of my friends had was good, although I don't know what you could do to fried chorizo to make it taste bad. I thought the service was excellent though, especially considering it was very busy. One tip for the Tapa Room is to avoid sitting close to the door if it's chilly outside because it's very draughty.Service was also absolutely impeccable upstairs in the Providores restaurant, which is a beautiful room that manages to be calm without being too dead. We went for their 3 course Sunday dinner which I think is about \u00a324 without wine - although to get a glass of wine is just a few quid extra which is pretty good value. Despite having recently sworn never to do so again, I ordered risotto because it involved wasabi, and it really did taste flavourful and interesting. My main of sea bass was cooked well although had a slightly odd (chemical?) taste at points. It came in a butterbean broth, which I didn't really get - isn't that just white liquid? Weird. Everyone else had the lamb which was great. My favourite course was dessert - I had a chocolate brownie which was just so unbelievably good, one of the best I have ever had, perfectly paired with golden crunch ice cream (slightly more of that would have been nice, it was such a good complement).I will try to go back and try that all day Tapa Room menu, but I shall never darken the door of brunch again. For now, it's getting 3 stars, I debated 2 stars considering the food-quality ratio but in the end the great service weighed in its favour.",

Unexpected bonus of reserving: you're placed in the upstairs room which is much calmer and more spacious than the downstairs communal table.The food was phenomenal. \u00a0I had the grilled chorizo with sweet potato and miso hash, and opted for a scrambled egg rather than the soft-boiled one that was listed on the menu. \u00a0(4th-grade Andrea was forever scarred by the smell of a classmate's boiled egg after it sat in a lunchbox all day.) \u00a0There were really tasty toppings as well, light garlic and cashew cremes as well as some greens. \u00a0The whole dish was imaginative and very, very delicious.Most of my friends went with the same option, though others also got the fry-ups and everyone was happy. \u00a0They also enjoyed the smoothies and a very pretty potato cake dessert.The place loses just one star on a few things: 1) my meal was a bit on the small side. \u00a0On the one hand, I didn't have that guess-its-time-to-go-back-to-sleep-from-this-food-coma reaction that brunch can sometimes provoke, which was a welcome change. \u00a0However, I was still somewhat hungry after eating, which wasn't ideal given that the place 2) wasn't cheap if you started needing to add some rather pricey sides. \u00a0 3) The coffee was just average; I think our fancy work coffee machine makes a better latte. \u00a0It's also worth noting this isn't a place to linger -- they warned us in advance they would need the table at 1. \u00a0I get why they need to do this and don't blame them for it in the least, but when they told us we needed to leave by 1, we didn't really appreciate being chased out at 12:45.All-in-all, the place would have been a resounding 5-star if not for the few issues identified above. \u00a0Even with these minor concerns, I could never give it less than 4 stars given just how awesome the food was.",

    "text": "A nice upscale tapas bar in Marylebone. Buzzing atmosphere with one giant communal table and many small tables for 2. I was a bit disappointed with the food, the menu was very hit or miss. Some items were great...the seared scallops and the risotto for instance, others were simply bland and/or not well executed---braised lamb and chocolate brownie (yes you can screw up a brownie apparently) I am looking at you. Given the huge crowd (it was late and it was midweek), I assume the issue was we chose our tapas poorly. Next time will have to try some of the others items on the menu...",

Good thing I obliged or I would have missed out on a little gem.The Tapa Room is a small room so we were quite lucky to secure a table when we first arrived - a minute later and a small line had formed outside the place.I ordered the Turkish breakfast - an odd combination of two poached eggs on whipped yoghurt with hot chili butter accompanied by sourdough toast. It sounded quite odd so I decided I'd give it a go. One of my better decisions to date! The silky smooth yogurt and the perfectly boiled and runny egg yolk go extremely well together with the yogurt stopping the yolk from running wild, but allow you to combine it as you like. The chili butter gives it the 'kick' that the dish needs. Perfect!I could eat this everyday, but I think my waistline would really disagree..",

    "text": "I quickly learned the difference between eating downstairs and upstairs: downstairs, no reservations are taken, whereas to eat upstairs in the restaurant you can reserve along with paying a \u00a31.50 cover charge -- no biggy, but we were informed that the ambience is more chill downstairs as well as the food is slightly better. \u00a0I couldn't compare, but I'm glad I went downstairs.There is communal seating in the sense that there are two large tables in the middle with stool seating, and then on the edges of the room, various tables and chairs, along with window seating at the front.I had a mixed berries and banana smoothie to start with, which was very fresh and tasty. Our friend had had mostly everything on the menu but said that the turkish eggs 'changa' was mind-blowing, so what more do I have to say -- I went Turkish, and I'm so glad. \u00a0Besides the \u00a0excess amount of melted chili butter, the plate was divine. \u00a0Two poached eggs with whipped yoghurt and some melted chili butter -- yes please -- to go on top of your choice of sourdough or seeded granary bread. Fantastic.Although we waited in line at 11.30am for about 30-45 minutes for 4 people, we were served in a timely fashion and were surprised at the continuing line when we were leaving around 1.30pm.Loved the place, loved the food, and loved the location.",

I always make sure to book 4-5 days in advance to be able to choose my time. Booking is more than recommended unless you are willing to wait. Service is fast and good. Your coat is taken when you arrive and the waiters are professional and helpful.I always have the two-egg, salmon, spinach with hollandaise sauce or the two-eggs fry up with veggies. Amazing. I personally like to ask for the hollandaise on the side because they put too much otherwise. The fruit salad is unique and super tasty with original flavors. The smoothies are a good drink to order while waiting for the main.Cannot wait to come back and have the Turkish eggs everyone talks about!When you book you will be sitted upstairs with a booking fee/person added to your bill - that is why I take out one star. A fee for booking? Seriously?In a nutshell: Obsessed",

After the first 10mins of figuring out the menu, we ordered and I certainly wasn't disappointed by the meal. The fish I ordered was perfectly cooked with some great sides and sauces which I felt was something I couldn't make myself. I was dreaming about the dish all afternoon whilst at work. Also the portions weren't too big. One colleague complained of small portions but I personally thought it was perfect coupled with a great quality latte and some lovely bread.The biggest tell tale of an obnoxious place is how many adjectives they put before the crux of the dish eg 'fresh, indian, pan seared with a dash of thyme beef'. This place was such a victim of this. Simplify the menu to at least put the main idea of the dish up top followed by a description I'd say is the friendliest.Anyway, worthwhile for a biz lunch!",

Downstairs they don't take reservations and it is more casual, but upstairs there is loads of room and it wasn't even crowded on a Sunday. The tables were half full and the service was excellent. It was relaxing, we could sit back and talk, and it was the exact opposite of my experience at Honey & Co.As for the food, it was equally stellar. We both got the Turkish eggs, as I had read great reviews about it, and it did not disappoint. For anyone that's never had it, there is oil floating around but it is not spicy, and the yogurt tasted quite like hollandaise sauce to me (but probably healthier!) There are two eggs and it comes with two slices of either granary or sourdough toast... could have done with another egg, I think, as I did get a bit hungry later in the afternoon.I also ordered an iced coffee and it wasn't exactly what I expected... I had in mind an iced americano, but instead it came rather frothy and blended, but luckily they hadn't put in sugar, so it wasn't a total disaster. Overall, I was so impressed and would definitely recommend this restaurant when you want to impress. There were a lot of menu items under 10 pounds, which I also think is quite a steal! Marylebone High Street is also just beautiful, so there is plenty of places nearby to pop by afterward.",

But still it looked nice and we were promptly seated at high tables, a bit close to our neighbours.Providores proved to be totally different than expected and this proved actually to be a very good thing. We were positively surprised with the creativity of the dishes, the ingredients and the quality of the food. We just ordered a quite random mix of some small dishes and shared them all and we loved them all. The tuna, the Turkish eggs, the mini squid, the Laksa, and all the other food we had, it was all very very tasty. Much pricier than the expected tapas, but much better value as well.So why do they call this place Tapa Room? If we believe the very friendly owners' story this is because there is a tapa hanging in the room..... meaning a flap, a lid, a cover, like a curtain.... So now you know.",

    "text": "I'll admit my familiarity with Peter Gordon is limited, but with a large wall of his cookbooks staring me in the face as I ate my meal, I got the feeling that the Providores is as much about the name behind the restaurant as it is the food.Judging by the line to eat Sunday brunch and the manner in which people were crammed into the downstairs space, this place is as trendy as you might expect from a place on Marleybone High to be. The food stays pretty down to Earth, though - I had \u00a0their version of Eggs Benedict - smoked salmon, poached eggs, spinach, and hollandaise, on their walnut toast. The entirety of the dish seemed to depend on the hollandaise - to cover up the slightly dry salmon, and to provide some brightness to the rest of the dish, which was very much lacking in salt. It was all pretty well cooked, \u00a0so I considered the dish an overall success, though not to the level you might expect from a restaurant which is offering copies of the owner's cookbook for sale.A bite of the French toast didn't reveal many new revelations, either, though I admittedly didn't get any of the banana stuffing, nor the bacon which adorned the top of it. Seemed like a popular dish, though, by my observations. Ultimately, the meal ended up being technically proficient, but not worth the trouble of \u00a0getting packed like sardines into the tiny restaurant and have to fight for the attention of the few waiters running around.",

The room is clean, fresh and with just enough room for the friendly serving staff to manoeuvre.The menu is a delight. Rather than select a traditional starter and main course, you're recommended to pick a few dishes but not in a tapas style. This helps solve the problem of choosing between dishes but doesn't really provide that much assistance as there was literally nothing on the menu that I didn't want to try.Ultimately I plumped for the salad (nice but an error as other dishes were tastier), tuna and beef. I was also able to try the souffl\u00e9, scallops, pork, a fish dish and the dahl. All excellent. \u00a0Top tip is to go with other people, and dive into their dishes as well as your own.",

It was a full house, packed and we were cramped between two groups of people on a long table and on high chairs.It's a nice little place, service was fast and the food came quick and it looked good. Tasted even better. I wasn't expecting much from the brunch menu, but was surprised how the food showed up. Eggs were cooked to perfection and the chorizos were excellent. I really enjoyed the meal. Unfortunately I wish I could take my own sweet time to enjoy the meal with my partner, but we could barely hear each others conversation. It was just way too cramp and crowded that I couldn't wait to finish it and just head out. It's probably a better place for groups of 4 friends to catch up, but definitely not a place to relax and read a book over the weekend.I would still give it 4 stars because the food and coffee was good and the service was quick. We were probably unlucky with the seating, but I guess we'd have to come another time to enjoy this place properly :)",

Customer service FAIL number one.I relented and was seated and then was promptly ignored for about 5-7 minutes- even though it was obvious I was ready to order, with my menus closed in front of me. The Australian waitress pointedly ignored me even though I was thisclosetoher as she served the next table. The LEAST she could have done was acknowledge me and let me know she would be with me in a moment. Not to straight out IGNORE me. Again, your customer service sucks.Finally, she graced me with her presence and I ordered the asparagus, the courgette soup and the almond milk/hazelnut/cocoa shake. The shake- the best part of the meal- arrived quickly as did the asparagus.You should be ashamed of yourselves for the price you charge for the asparagus. What an underwhelming meal. I have had thick, juicy asparagus spears at many restaurants before and the four, thin asparagus spears you offer with tiny slivers of goat cheese are are pathetic. Seriously, hat you would get at Sainsbury.The soup- or rather, I should say, soap- arrived, looking lovely and tasting, just like lime soap.The waitress kindly offered to have the soap soup removed from my bill. I was grateful for that. Another server came over and apologized and said the taste was actually due to the keffir lime. Really? Funny, because I had the same ingredient in a monkfish dish the DAY BEFORE at Dinerama in Shoreditch and it was delicious.So, in conclusion, please learn actual customer service. I can't understand why this is SO HARD for you Europeans. I would have happily spent more- and tipped the waitress- if you treated me like a paying customer and human being. As a native New Yorker, the level of service I get in my hometown versus here is like night and day.I'm an active Yelper and TripAdvisor contributor and I'll recommend everyone stay away from your establishment.Jennifer C.

    "text": "Went to dinner tonight. \u00a0The food was great. \u00a0Here's what we ordered:Miso-baked aubergine, dates, feta, crispy buckwheat and tahini yogurt Thai green curryChorizo burgerSoupThe problem started with the server who set a place of jamon on our table. \u00a0When I told him it wasn't mine, he said \"oh\" and then proceeded to the table behind us and picked up our Miso-baked aubergine (and the guest said \"sorry\"). \u00a0When he saw that I was watching what was going on, he proceeded to take the plate back to the kitchen, and another server brought the same dish back out almost immediately. \u00a0When asked whether the other guest had touched the food, this second server said, \"of course not\". \u00a0I didn't like the way they handled it, but that's fine.Soon later, the Thai green curry had arrived. \u00a0The curry was really yum, and very well-prepared. \u00a0 I then was waiting for my chorizo burger. \u00a0Then I waited, and waited until my mom had finished half of the curry already (it was a big portion). \u00a0I then asked to have the soup cancelled as there was no way for me to catch up. \u00a0Then the burger finally came, and that too tasted good. \u00a0This is when the server told me that the soup will be coming shortly, and asked whether I still wanted it, and I said yes.I had one bite left on my burger before the soup had arrived. \u00a0It tasted horrible. \u00a0And lukewarm. \u00a0So the protocol issue and the ordering/timing of the food at this restaurant was horrible. \u00a0And this is my second time to the restaurant (I am seeing a pattern here with my two London reviews), I am not sure whether I will go back. \u00a0But hey, the food is good for sure. \u00a0Just don't get the soup.",

I didn't find the staff very friendly, in fact our waitress was rather curt during our visit! I ordered the grilled chorizo which arrived just barely warmed through, served atop what was described as a sweet potatoes hash but in reality was a pur\u00e9e. The dish lacked texture overall as was disappointingly small for a brunch dish! My friends had the Turkish eggs which were swimming in grease and looked wholly unappealing. Bellinis were tasty, \u00a0but on the whole with the portion sizes and service issues I'd be hesitant to return for the price point. Shame!",

The waiter was a little unsure when answering my questions (how big are the portions?, is a particular dish fulfilling?, what's his favourite dish?) The food was delicious though and I would go back.",

Sooo delicious i want it again now! Appart from that, they also do a very interesting black pudding with apple stir fry and very interesting smoothies with bunch of fruits i dont even know!!! In terms of location cannot really go wrong with Marylebone High St! Love that street, great mixture of standarf high st shops and more independent offering, and when the sun is shinning its very great! One thing worth the mention - my friend had booked for us a table but when we arrived there was no reservation for us. Luckily they managed ro get us a sit (we did arrive at 1.45pm) but this place tends to be very busy on Sunday so if we had been a little unlucky (or arrived earlier when busier) this disappointment would not have gone done too well... Maybe just unluky they lost our reservation but still wanted to mention....",

The menu offers the more usual brunch/breakfast-type things like a superb full english or veggie english, but the menu is so varied and interesting I had to opt for something a bit different. I went for the hot smoked salmon on walnut toast, with spinach, 2 (perfect) soft-boiled eggs and finished off with hollandaise - top notch. Great smoothies too. It gets very busy at peak times, e.g brunch and dinner, and you can't book downstairs so it's pretty crowded, quite loud, and rather hot - which is why it only gets 4 stars and not 5. But, you can book upstairs, the more formal dining area if you call in good time. Definitely worth a visit and I'll be going back for more",

You can usually expect a wait but although it's crowded, the room does have real tapas bar feel to it. It's fusion that actually works and draws heavily from asian influences. Dishes change often but the duck spring rolls and hot smoked salmon are great. The portions are fairly small but end up being quite filling and I've actually never managed to save room for pudding although they do look tempting. Next on the list is stopping by for brunch as the menu looks mouthwatering.",
