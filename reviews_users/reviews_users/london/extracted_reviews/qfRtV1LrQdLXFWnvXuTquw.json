While I was eating dinner, the royal family from Dubai was eating next to me. Clearly this is a place well liked.",

We started with their signature cocktails and we were excited for the food since the cocktails were good. We ordered their tasting menu along with the wine pairing. What a huge mistake!Not only is it not worth the money but the wine pairing was absolutely embarrassing. There was no sommelier to explain anything about the wine, the wines were simply placed hoping we would figure out what they were by sipping on them. The food was just ok and some dishes were even mediocre at best. The service... I would say it was perhaps the worst of the entire experience. Since the food and the wines were mediocre you can guess what the service was like. Just because they wear a fancy outfit doesn't translate to an impressive service. I highly doubt I'd be going back... Terribly disappointed since I wanted to visit their other restaurants since I'm a huge foodie and in London quite often.",

My family was in awe of how beautiful the space is, and the waiter was incredibly helpful when we went to order--he put in a few orders of sides to go with what we had already ordered for us. Additionally, the waitstaff so attentive, always there to help me as I tried pouring more cocktail (Pimms, mint, fruit, lemonade--it was awesome!!) into my glass.Now, the food. I had the butter chicken, and it came out in a small dish that was heating it. I poured the chicken and sauce over my rice, and oh my was the flavor incredible! My brother's lamb was also so tender it fell apart--it was a table favorite. I loved my first experience with Indian food, and thanks to Chutney Mary, I will definitely be eating more of it.",

First impressions were good. A doorman opened the door and we were showed to reception to check our coats. The dining room is pretty cool with good ambiance but not as spectacular as I was expecting based on other reviews.Anyway so the meal:I had the rose and lychee martini which was a very nice cocktail. Not too sweet. \u00a313 though.My starter was the lobster chilli fry which was awesome. Really tender lobster pieces with just the right level of spice. Pricey at \u00a319 but it was a decent portion of lobster and like I said, tasted fantastic.For the main I had the vegetarian silver crescent which is a selection of veggie stuff (creamed spinach, lentil curry, okra and paneer kofta). If I'm honest the main left me a little disappointed. It was all good enough (the kofta was actually very good) but didn't strike me as amazing. I found the naan bread a little dry and tasteless too which is shame.So I was generally disappointed because while everything was good, it didn't seem to justify the very high prices (lobster excluded).Service was again ok but not amazing. I think I'm comparing in my head to Veeraswamy which is a slightly higher level.My dining companions were pretty happy with their meals and they looked pretty good so maybe I just went wrong with my main. I would still go back to try their prawn curry.",

I suppose you will say that that is somewhat debatable, after you've tried the boneless chicken wings starter.Starters: duck salad, boneless chicken wings, and crab cakes. All excellent.The biryani at Chutney Mary gets the gold. The portions are sumptuously adequate. The presentation is elegant. The spicing and tempering is just right. The kosha mangsho is almost perfect with the exception of the absence of potatoes. No Bengali cooking of meat goes without potatoes, however sophisticated the cooking style.The prawn curry is divine. The chef uses an orgasmically adequate amount of mustard paste in the cooking to stir the taste of the audience, and the result is a revelation of sorts. The date kulfi is worth trying, and uses the Bengali date molasses in the ice cream.Come prepared to eat a hearty meal, and you will have a close to emotional experience at this reinvented restaurant.",

I thought it was interesting that children aren't allowed after a certain time, but we were able to fob off the mini-me so it didn't end up being a problem. Also interesting that we had trouble getting a 7:30 reservation, because there were several empty tables throughout the 1.5 hours we enjoyed dinner. Service: Pretty good overall...definitely took a while for someone to take our order but aside from that no complaints.Food: Excellent!-- Crab cakes are fantastic. Definitely order these.-- Trio of Tikkas are a bit spicy but the beetroot tikka was phenomenal. I highly recommend this dish.-- Husband enjoyed the Chicken Tikka but commented on the spice level being a bit high.-- Saag was kind of a miss. It was too spicy and the consistency was a bit off-putting.-- Basmati rice as just okay. Nothing special.-- Spelt naan (plain and garlic) were delicious. A must order.Overall we left Chutney Mary rather contented. Prices were reasonable, service was good, and nothing was too greasy. My only complaint is the spice level is a bit high but aside from that we'll definitely return!",

Crabcakes, vegetable platter, palak paneer, prawns, Lamb curry.... nothing disappointed. Put this place on your agenda! (would be a beautiful spot for a business lunch or dinner, by the way)",

    "text": "Sadly, Chutney Mary has changed. This used to be my favorite restaurant in London when I lived there, so I brought my whole family while visiting from the US. I booked online, and my reservation confirmation stated that children only above the age of 8 are permitted in the dining room and only from 6 to 8 PM. \u00a0I was relieved, because my kids were both over the age of 12. Unfortunately, this policy is lip service only. We were seated right next to two children under the age of two, who screamed the whole time, ruining our experience. When I complain to our server and asked to be seated elsewhere, he refused. Only when we got up to leave did the manager come over and seat us in the actual dining room.(Before, we were seated in the front lounge.) The manager told us no children are permitted in the actual dining room, and we could only be seated in the front lounge because of our kids but he would make an exception this time. However, we were told we only had 45 minutes to eat because another party was booked after us. Because of this compressed timeframe, I think they skimped on the quality of the food, because there was nothing special about our meal. Also, we noticed plenty of children in the dining room, so again, I felt like the children policy in the restaurant was inconsistent. We paid over \u00a3300 for a very lackluster meal. There are plenty of better upscale Indian restaurants in London. I will not be bringing my family (or my clients for the matter) back here again ever.",

    "text": "A friend of mine went here and absolutely loved it. She was raving about how great the service was, tasty the food, fabulous the drinks, yada yada yada. I can only think I went on an off day. Walking in, I thought it was gorgeous. However, it was a bit strange - being there had been a door guy and everything - that there wasn't anyone to greet us inside. I stood looking around at the bar in confusion for a while before spying the host stand at the other end of the room. Quickly we were checked in and brought to our table and that's when things took a turn. We order a couple drinks. Or rather we tried too. The first one they didn't have and the second one - a peach infused bourbon Old Fashioned- we were told they were out of peach liqueur..... Which was not listed in the ingredients. When we asked, the server looked confused and told us it was actually a liqueur. Oooookkkkk.....We grabbed a basic Bloody Mary and the Kafir Lime Gimlet with the ingredients listed as Gin, Kafir Lime and Dill. Dry, tart and boozy was what I was expecting, yet alas, sweet, syrupy and not at all what I wanted was what i experienced. Que my sad face. When we went for a second round, we asked the waiter about it and he said that they didnt actually list all the ingredients for the cocktails. But what about allergies? Oh surely people will tell them, right? Um.... And then the food. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was probably alright even bordering on good, but nothing really stood out. Plus our waiter messed up our order repeatedly. Like bringing dishes we hadn't ordered and having the curry come with rice when we had asked for the other option (lemon quinoa), which we then waited 15 min to arrive (meaning the curry had grown cold) only to be told that the quinoa doesn't go with the curry. Thanks pal. So glad you told us that to start with.Moral of this story? If you want Indian, there are so many other others. Do yourself a favour.",

It's known for being contemporary and cutting edge, all this panache congruous to glossy St James address.I came here with a group of 20 for a set menu dinner. As far as the food went, it was not fiercely spiced and had good flavoring. The 4 pot serving dish consisted of: Mangalore Prawn, Butter Chicken, Lamb, and Spinach Lasooni Palak, giving you a teaser of everything. The starter was a prawn meets chicken dish. The dessert was...not memorable.I didn't see anything particularly unusual or innovative in the food itself. Perhaps this is the downfall of the set menu. The service was fine, if not a touch slow. As glamorous as the boundless upstairs space is, with \u00a0turquoise and mahogany color palette and sparkling glass, the private dining room downstairs left me feeling slightly scrunched.",

I was really glad that we did. I've had my share of good Indian food in London and Chutney Mary is at the top of the list. It is a sister restaurant of another favorite of mine, Veeraswamy. The Indian food in the U.K. is much more sophisticated than what we are used to in the States; not every Indian place has a buffet and is cheap. The cooking style at Chutney Mary is very sophisticated. The ambiance is clubby upscale and much of the weekday evening clientele consists of the investment bankers from the nearby offices. Everything we ordered was fantastic. The flaky Cornish crab garlic butter was a small dish of lumps of crab meat saut\u00e9ed in ample butter and spices served with some naan. The calamari with lime and chili chutney was another delightful appetizer. The wild Madagascar prawns were large (the size of a small fist) with the perfect texture. The butter chicken is similar to chicken tikka masala and was delicious; we were using the garlic naan to wipe up the sauce. \u00a0The biryani (forgot the name but it's vegetarian) was exceptional and the server suggested adding yogurt (pomegranate infused), which gave it an extra layer of flavors. All the other dishes we had were all superbly prepared. I'd say this is my new favorite Indian restaurant in London.",

It was actually relatively packed, so we snagged a pair of seats at a large, beautiful wood communal table.We were very hungry and almost ordered everything on the menu, but decided to stick with the premium prix fixe menu. I wish I could remember everything that was served, but let's just say we ate every single drop of food on our plates and wished the night would never end.

    "text": "Chutney Mary was a recommendation we had gotten for our recent trip to London, and since we haven't eaten as much Indian as I would have liked in our past trips here, we decided to stop by for a Christmas Eve lunch. We were the first folks in when we came shortly after noon, and even by the time we had left 1.5 hours later, the main dining room had a handful of tables filled at most, with a few more parties out in the more casual setting out front. What I really liked is how the decor fused Indian sensibilities, particularly the bright colors, with a very modern, cosmopolitan sense of dining. It felt much more effortless than similar restaurants I have been to in NYC. The only drawback of the entire experience was the service...after we were seated, we had to flag down the waiter to put our order in, as well as request still water for the table. I write that off a little to us being the first people in the door, but it showed a lack of attention. The drink list is interesting, with standard cocktails coming with an Indian twist, as well as a selection of some English craft beers (there's a wine list as well, but I didn't really look at it).For lunch, there is a 2-course and 3-course prix fixe option (the 3-course version gives you dessert for an extra 5 pounds); we went with the 2-course option, which was by far enough food, and ordered a dal makhani on the side (in hindsight, probably too much). Everything here was excellent, as well as being a decent amount of food to boot. I started out with the lamb burger sliders, which I really enjoyed - very flavorful and succulent, with a Western-style presentation but very much infused with Indian spices and flavors. Our mains were similarly excellent, with my wife's lobster biryani really standing out. The rice was infused with the spiced aroma of seafood, and the lobster was quite delicious. I had never tasted a seafood-based biryani before, but this was excellent. I did something a little more along traditional lines (for me), sticking with the butter chicken curry. I enjoyed the balance of the sauce - lots of tomato, but with just the right amount of butter and cream to cut the curry. I would have liked the chicken cut into slightly smaller pieces, but that is a very minor nitpick on a curry dish that is better than pretty much any curry I have eaten in the past.While the cost for lunch felt high, it was a much better value than the previous day's meal, and for London, it seemed about the kind of price to expect. The location is great, the ambiance is fantastic, and the food is excellent. I'd definitely recommend a stop here for a meal - everything was top-notch, with only the service being something that could use a little work.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is very classy, and the prices match the fine dining experience. I had the Afghan chicken tikka, garlic naan, basmati rice, and garlic spinach. The clear winner for this meal was the spinach. All the others were also high quality, but the spinach had that Indian spice that made the rest delicious.The only reason I'm rating this as a 4 and not a 5 is the slower service. I was here on a Friday night in London, so perhaps my expectations for service are too American. But if you know that you have the time and money to enjoy the experience here, it's certainly worth the visit!",

    "text": "Hot and Cold.So, I missed the debate a few years back on whether meals at Indian restaurants should cost 70 quid per person. Like many people in the US who're stuck on seeing Indian restaurants as cheap lunch buffets, there's a large number of people in the U.K. that seem to equate cheap curries with good Indian food. It's an unfair generalization for I don't see cuisines like French, Italian, or Japanese put in that bucket. Personally, I don't have an issue in shelling out 70 pounds for a meal at an Indian restaurant, as long as the price point is warranted by the food quality, some innovation in technique or pairing of ingredients in a manner that leads to dishes that I've not seen elsewhere. But, I do have an issue when at the end of the meal I leave thinking that 2/3 of the bill was paying for swanky premises, upscale decor, art, mahogany, antiques, chandeliers, carpets etc. - as opposed to the craftsmanship of a chef (and his/her team) that truly wowed or surprised me.Sadly, for me Chutney Mary falls in that category of restaurants. The dining room is undeniably grand and stunning. But, as far as food goes, whenever I liked something in a dish, there would be a counterpoint that bothered. The Cornish crab itself may have excelled in taste and texture, but the pool of melted garlic butter left me with the same heavy feeling I get after eating greasy curries. Speaking of greasy, if I wanted a Paratha I would have ordered one. I'm not exactly sure why the garlic naan seemed dabbed in a wet rub of garlic instead of minced garlic cloves. Presenting Gajjar Halwa as a souffl\u00e9 was interesting, but it didn't really pair well with the pistachio ice cream. I tried the elements separately and then together and ended up keeping the two different temperatures and textures apart from each other as I found that better. But, I did debate what a baked Alaska of the two combinations would taste like (food for thought for the management) :)My favorite item was the Tandoori Grouse served with Masala chips which showcased all the joys one associates with Indian cuisine: heat, aromatic spices, and dry (as opposed to an Olympic pool of) curry.The service was attentive and even the manager dropped in regularly to check in on me. That will keep them in good stead with the smartly dressed families that seemed regulars at the restaurant. I think the owners know their market to a T: well heeled folks who were dropped off by their chauffeur in a Bentley. But, pretension never works for me, and so I'll probably try the other restaurants in their empire (Amaya, Veeraswamy) on my next visit to London.",
