The two of us had the Lumberjack breakfast + coffee + orange juice, and the total came to a whopping \u00a330. Seems a bit steep, considering that it's just 2 eggs, 2 rashers (not smoked streaky bacon like it should be), and 3 thin pancakes that tasted mysteriously of apple and were served with Golden Syrup instead of maple. While the pancakes weren't bad, they just weren't pancakes in the \"classic american diner\" sense, which is how they are billed. At least give us some maple-flavoured syrup! Otherwise there's really nothing american about it. The \"bottomless\" coffee is only on request. The wait staff do not come by and offer more if you don't ask.",

We were seated right away, although during our meal we over heard people being told that there is a half an hour wait for a table. They apparently operated a service where by they would text your phone when your table is ready, but we must have come at a good time. We ordered the Hungry Man Breakfast and a Lumberjack Breakfast, a coke and a still water which came up to \u00a324.98 and it came slowly at that. The meal itself was unfortunately neither quality nor quantity and I don't think I'll be hurrying back any time soon, certainly not at that price. On the other hand the atmosphere was good but the end of the meal I was given the wrong bill - a more expensive one from another table. So by the end although it looks promising, The Diner has more downs than ups.",

However, I did manage to drag my poor, unsuspecting friend in last night since it was on the way home.I have to say I wasn't that impressed. Perhaps it's because I've lived in the States for too long so I'm pretty conditioned to how my chili hot dog should taste, and the consistency of my milkshake. I had a bacon double cheeseburger, and a beer, which came to about \u00a39, but was pretty forgettable. The one member of staff was a little overworked so service wasn't tremendous. We did however sit next to some famous bloke from the TV, who supposedly lives in Camden and who my friend has a huge crush on, so this made her very happy indeed. I get the feeling that you'd be better off going to this diner's counterpart in Soho, where the decor is more in tune with original Americana and the atmosphere is more kicking.",

    "text": "I had great expectations for The Diner in Camden - after keenly watching its transformation from the sticky cesspit known as Arizona Bar - however despite making some fairly clear promises, it fails to deliver. Everything about the place cues your brain into thinking American style (although just as we walked in it seemed less 50's diner and more Ralph Bakshi?!), and yet unlike other businesses which operate the same facade (Ed's Easy Diner, Automatic, Johnny Rockets) it feels annoyingly English. Not that there's anything wrong with English (far from it!), but why buy into a look you can't carry through? I opted for the winningly greasy post-Friday-night combination of an omelette with ham & peppers, chocolate milkshake, and cheese fries to share with my learned colleague who was in a similar state to me. The omelette was insipid & perfunctory at best, the fries were incredibly greasy even without the contribution from the cheese, and the milkshake was similarly passable - nothing was bad as such, but nothing about the place made you want to go back there. Another way of saying it would be that the breakfasts weren't big enough to make you feel like you'd gotten value for money, but weren't tasty enough that you'd wished you'd been given more. Every forkful of the forgettable fare offered here made the pair of us wish we'd opted for going around the corner to Bar Solo instead. About the only thing we felt this place really had working in its favour was offering a place to sit down and chill out for a moment amid the lunacy of a Saturday in the heart of Camden.",

I think a better time to visit, if at all, would probably be midweek, as the service was a little slow and it took a while to get seated. I liked the decor - as people have said already it's in a typical American diner style, and when I went the waitresses all seemed to be dressed in old-style outfits. I'm not entirely sure if that's their normal choice of clothes or if this is restaurant policy! The food itself was fine, although nothing special. Burger was far better than TGIs et al, chips were as you'd expect. My friends had an American breakfast (a bit small) and a hot dog (uninspired). For the money, I'd expect better, and there are loads of better alternatives.",

This was particularly true when the gross Arizona bar was replaced by the Diner, at a time when Camden was sorely missing the Hawley Arms. Oh what a disappointment the Diner turned out to be. The building itself is excellent with a very tasteful and comfy roof terrace. But sadly the food is lacklustre and over priced. If they would just knock their prices down and improve the quality, I would love to go back. But \u00a34 for a milkshake is terrible. Thankfully the Hawley is back, for affordable tasy grub. And if you fancy splashing the cash, head to Hache on Inverness Street for a delicious burger. Diner: Must try harder. Please try harder.",

My dining experience recently was no different. They only thing i've noticed about the portion size at The Diner is that it is generally fairly average and leaves you wanting more, however, I decided to sample something new, The Breakfast Burrito. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the one they do at the Breakfast Club, so they had a strong criteria to meet. You will be pleased to hear it met up to my standards, plus you get a side of beans and smashed avocado. For 8 nuggets you can't go wrong). The real things to sample there as always are the Shakes. At 5 squirrels a go they can seem expensive, but whatever magic they put in them, is totally worth it. There is outdoor seating and if they have the garden open on the top deck make sure you take advantage of the sun and eat up there. The outdoor tables are a little wobbly, so just don't jig about on them too much. Oh and should you leave your card there... don't get home before you realise. Sexy Rob",

    "text": "I have been to a number of this chain and was expecting good things of the Camden branch. My usual venue of choice is Islington but we were here on a friends birthday meal.We arrived early evening and decided to go upstairs to the al-fresco area. This is an open rooftop area which suited some of the guests who are smokers. The service upstairs was, at first, the usual attentive and personable sort I normally associate with The Diner and as guests arrived they were dealt with in friendly and quick fashion by a charming waiter. However as the meal progressed it became clear that we were either in the middle of a shift change or the friendly waiter was best suited to downstairs. It also became clear that the upstairs area was closing. We managed to order our main courses and sides before he disappeared,The second waiter appeared personable once again but seems more than a little distracted. We ordered desserts and I ordered a hard shake. The desserts took more than a little time to arrive as we were informed the sundaes took up to 15 minutes to produce. We duly waited about 25 minutes and the waiter was nowhere to be seen to order another drinks round either. When he did arrive he unloaded the back of the tray first and left the sundaes at the front. As soon as he backed away they overbalanced and crashed to the floor. One of the guests jacket and chair was splattered by the ice cream and sauce and another shoes covered too. The waiter picked up the sundaes, apologised and ran off to get something to clean it with. He was gone about 5 minutes by which time we had already employed wet wipes. The 'replacement' sundaes arrived not 2 minutes later which leads me to believe that they were the original ones that had fallen topped off again. Still the guests ate them.However it wasn't until they had nearly finished the desserts that I had to collar the waiter to find out if my hard shake was coming at all. He duly informed me that it had 'gone through'. I politely pointed out that this doesn't mean I had it and he went to check. Another 5 minutes and it duly turned up meaning I had to hurry and finish as everyone else was ready to leave. Upon requesting the bill, not a single offer of apology was made as we paid and left. As I closed the door I resolved that I wouldn't return againThe two stars awarded were for the service and food quality before the shift change otherwise it would have been 1 star",

(A not very foodie requirement, but i do love a bit of Alt music)Now this is where this place doesnt get 5 stars, the service is a little sucky; in particular from the Host, who doesnt seem to care, or hold himself in any sort of professional manner which is a little unusual. This may have been as it was very busy, but it still resonates as something i wouldnt want to experience again.The food!There are so many things on this menu i wanted to try! I would def recommend they have a selection of mini sliders on a platter as a new dish as one just is not enough!I settled for the whatever burger (cant remember its name) It was pretty much a big mac, except in the taste department, where it left its rival standing, although i think the burger pattie itself couldve done with a hit of seasoning during the cooking process. The burger sauce was delicious though i happily mopped up the falling out remnants with the sweet potato fries.Also i point you towards the milkshakes, they are a little expensive (maybe im just saying that as im used to Northern prices) but they are packed with taste.Again when it came to paying, or should i phrase it when they asked us to pay to turn over the table as quickly as possible, i wasnt a big fan.Great food, great drinks, great music and ambience. Not so great service, however as i pointed out before it was very busy.",

Once you've got over the novelty of being in a replicated American diner in Camden though (or Soho or Islington for that matter), then you come to realise that the food isn't actually that great! Shame really.My cheesesteak (and it wasn't a cheesesteak... arrrggghhh) turned up just the right side of luke warm, and my chilli fries had perhaps, I like to think, been waiting for the perfect customer for, I dunno, a couple of hours? The milkshake was of course delicious, and I'm glad they've got that right. Peanut butter for an extra 50p? Yes please!I'd go again and hope I hit the place at a bad time on this occasion.Oh and who comes to a place like this to snog each others face off for, literally, 30mins?

Chocolate & peanut butter FTW They are a bit pricey but considering they serve you the 'leftovers' you can usually get at least two glasses full :) The service is always good here too; fast and attentive to their customers. The place has a rocking soundtrack that doesn't sound like Grease (even though you feel like you have stepped into a 50s film set) and there are plenty of booths. Plus the upstairs deck is noice - a hidden beer garden in summer.Though I have to agree with the 3-star average rated by the rest of the Yelpers - as The Diner is fairly over priced for the food that you get. A tiny burger and a few french fries. But I guess you are paying for 'the experience' and it's the no-brainer appeal of the place that keeps me coming back (plus those shakes!).",

Guess I'm always just expecting something more along the lines of a ma and pa diner. \u00a0Speaking of which, I need to finish my review of the Original Pantry Cafe in Los Angeles...

I like the idea of not having to look out of the window to witness all the dramas outside.The dim lit, leather booth interiors, swing music, gives it that smokey jazz atmosphere! The staff members are friendly and they look amazing, they remind me off the characters in Grease. Its a 3 course menu including side dishes. I've been there twice and first time round I wasnt impressed with the food I ordered..partly my fault as I was just tight with my budget 0_oI opted for the fish burger, the bread was hard and fish was slightly dry. However it did not stop me from giving them the benefit of the doubtSecond time round I decided to get out of my comfort zone and opted for the corn dogs with the chunky chips. Oh man the corn dogs were yummy! and the chips were devine! :p Abit gutted that I had to pay 30p extra for a blob of mayo. For dessert I got me the waffle with ice cream. Good choice!Time out voted them best budget award, however you do get what you paid for (in portions). I wouldnt mind going there again. Its American food (not like the average dixy chicken or southern fried chicken down the high street that claim to serve American food) The Diner is the closest it gets to American Diner food",

I'd rather just find some tasty, filling and cheap food from The Stables Market round the corner than wait for 30 minutes for my food order. At least in the market you get service with a smile!",

Visitor from California so it was awesome to see hot sauce on the tables and avocados on the menu :-)Facebooked everyone back home about the red white and blue menus with a collection of classic diner food with Mexican dishes thrown in. Definitely not the US attitude toward our cuisine but actually super accurate. Free wifi not working when we were here but that seems pretty standard for London in my very limited experience. Free refills on coffee and outlets in every booth make it a great place to do work.Haven't tried the hard milkshakes but will definitely be back to find out.",

It basically does what it says on the tin and you get what you expect.The selection of burgers is good and pretty like the ones you can get in diner's in America from my personal experince. The food is good, quick and filling. It's not good for you, it's a little greasy, but it's tasty and does the job. The menu has some fun things and the usual American and Mexican fair, meatloaf, chilli, breakfasts, hotdogs, milkshakes, lots of sugary desserts and pancakes that are very nommy.The price for central London is decent, burgers hover around the \u00a35 to \u00a38 mark, which I don't think is bad. The sides selection is great and drinks are varied and cocktails fun. Staff always seem friendly and happy to help. All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite, a decent American diner.",

    "text": "Having heard a lot about this place, and being a big fan of the American Diner experience, I was looking forward to my first meal here. I had it last Saturday (15/1/2011) and was very underwhelmed.For a start, I hated the music - What kind of American-style diner plays Beautiful South? Often the atmosphere and music is the best part of a diner but in this area The Diner failed spectacularly.The biggest problem was the service, which in my eyes was nothing short of a disgrace - A team of bored, non-chalant, uncaring women who seemed to take eye contact as some sort of massive task and were happy doing as little as possible and getting each customer out of the door as quickly as possible. We stood patiently by the 'please wait to be seated' sign for nearly fifteen minutes but I'm not really sure why we bothered, considering the amount of people who barged in past us to the empty tables to no reaction from the waiting staff. Eventually we just sat ourselves down with no problems, but not sure why the sign needs to be there. The only interaction we had with the waitresses was to place our order, receive our order and pay our bill - No one asked us how our meal was, if there was anything we needed or anything like that and I had to flag down three separate waitresses just to get the free refill on my coffee!The food was fine, if a little overpriced. I had a very nice bacon-cheeseburger with some well-prepared fries and I can highly recommend the coffee, which was terrific. When paying we did leave a tip but, par for the course, were not thanked and didn't even get a goodbye.If you want a proper Diner experience, with fantastic serive and proper decor including music, I'd recommend Ed's Diner. The Diner's food is standard as far as diners go but the service is lousy. I look forward to exploring Camden's resturants more but doubt I'll bother checking in here again.",

If you come when the place isn't overly crowded, the pancakes are top notch, as is everything else we've tried here (all breakfasty foods, I will admit). When it's very busy, though, the food is a bit hit and miss. The last time we were here, I got toasted corn bread with smashed avocado with chili peppers and two poached eggs on top. And a few bites of his pancakes. It was absolutely delicious, and will likely be my new staple - when I don't have those pancakes. Speaking of the pancakes, it's the plain buttermilk pancakes that are the best. I got blueberry pancakes once and was disappointed to see that it's just the plain pancakes, served with a blueberry sauce instead of maple syrup. When I think blueberry pancakes, I think blueberries in the batter - but maybe that's just me?",

I prefer their breakfast menu. So why 3 stars and not higher? The service here- though nice- is very slow. They simply do not hire enough staff to cover how busy this place is. I waited once 45 minutes for my bill. Not cool! Also- if you want to grab someone's attention after you have your food that is going to be a difficult one- as there is simply not enough staff to cover all the tables!The food is true to American style on most dishes. I've went twice for breakfast. \u00a0I got the blueberry pancakes which were good but it's regular pancakes covered in a very thick blueberry sauce (may want to ask for light on the sauce). The second visit I got the veg. breakfast burrito which was very good and comes with black beans & guacamole. You should also order some hash-browns as the burrito is pretty small and you need something to absorb the spice. I will the veg breakfast burrito again if we go back. My husband gets the lumberjack breakfast and really enjoys it.For dinner I was not blown away by the food. I got the halloumi bun and felt it was covered in sauce. Don't like the combo of pesto & hummus. Pick one! I'd definitely ask for your sauce on the side with that dish. Diner fries with sauce were okay but tasted too much of sugar in the sauce. Wouldn't order those fries again.I'd definitely come back here for breakfast but just make sure you ask for the bill as soon as they put the food down to eliminate the long wait afterwards.",

Someone at my table watched her breakfast sit in the window for 15 minutes, while mine wasn't bad in flavour, it wasn't what was promised on the menu description and the hot dog that was ordered by another was just obviously under a heat lamp as well. American-style service was not part of the theme. We entered and staffed seemed \u00a0nonplussed that we were there. After we sent back the lumberjack breakfast that was cold they gave us back the same plate heated up again (under a heat lamp no doubt) the eggs were curling at the edges where they had been over lamp-heated and dried out. I know image is a lot and when people are talking about the diner in their reviews they think the atmosphere is cool and the menu reads well, but I really noticed wasn't those things but the mediocre food. Many will keep going here but I hope that they bring the standard of their food higher. Another reason why I question chains that grow so quickly because they have a trendy vibe not a renown menu.",

    "text": "This place is the perfect breakfast diner, an all-day breakfast diner. Hearty American pancakes with bacon, eggs and maple syrup makes a classic meal and these guys do them well. You feel stuffed by the end. The burgers on the other hand, though there is provide a lot of variety, tend to be a bit over cooked and greasy, sitting heavy in your stomach. And once again sides are not thrown in with the pricing so you're going to end up paying more than \u00a310 to get the whole meal. I've eaten here sometimes when sides alone have been sufficient though and the chilli cheese fries are great. To top of the diner experience you've got a whole bunch of sugary desserts and milkshakes (which you can spice up with some bourbon). There's also some good American beers on the menu that aren't easily found in shops, so take advantage!",

I sunk my teeth into the soft bun then it hit me, the crunch of the pickle/onion, then the cheese and bacon, then the show stopper, the patty, then i gave the groan, i was in heaven, my brother looked at me like I was some kind of nut job that had just escaped broad-moor, but i didn't care, each mouthful was lush, I also had some wet fries and mac 'n' cheese to ride shotgun with my burger, tasty but nothing to write home about. My Brother had the Kansas Dog, which was a beef frank, topped with cheese and pulled pork, that also looked amazing.I will be coming back here soon to sample more meaty goodness,",

But its alright with tomato ketchup.Potato Skins: With bacon and melted cheese tasted good if the cheese was a bit more mature, it would of toped it off for me.Mac & Chees: Ive had Caribbean, Ive had Waitrose ready made, Ive even made my own but NOTHING prepared me for the taste that was about \u00a0to enter my mouth. It was moist...creamy and cheesy and soooo good. I had to save that one to last just to savour the taste.This place is cheap and and its going in my \u00a310 London list.

I've probably just ruined that, right? Downstairs is boring for those that have actually eaten in a diner in America, but come last weekend when the sun finally showed itself, a fab place to dig in for the afternoon. We had a sun-trap table in the corner and, yes, the service could be faster but was very pleasant. Dishes range from \u00a36 - \u00a310 ish for budgers, burritos, huevos rancheros, omelettes and pancakes etc.Go for the lumberjack breakfast - not often, mind. Your arteries might kill you in rebellion.Speaking of rebellion, watch the obligatory service charge too.And don't tell anyone American about the price. My ex laughed his socks off when I said I'd been drinking Lone Star at \u00a33.30 by the bottle when his Texas local charges $4.00 a jug!!!!",

    "text": "I love the concept of a all day breakfasts and late night diners. I love \u00a0booths. I love friendly waitress who sit down with us whilst taking our orders. And to add to mix, a roof top terrace is dandy (although it shuts at 8). So far so good - a US style diner, not overly strewn with Americana and memorabilia. Similarly with the other The Diners in London I am less impressed with the execution. A visit was due, after a few evening drinks at the bar opposite. The boy found himself hungry and myself and Vicky L craved *healthy* milkshakes. The boy's food arrived - a decent-ish looking vegetarian mushroom burger. The fries we ordered with our drinks came - an impressively healthy sized basket of chips. However the raison d'etre of our visit, the milkshakes never materialised. We waited and waited. I kept hearing the blender go whizz. \"We're next\" I thought excitedly. Each time \"thunk\" sank my heart time as the waitress kept serving booths behind us. We saw just one lady making milkshakes, so thought perhaps there was a backlog. Slowly the fries diminished in number. We planned to fill ourselves on the shakes, not the chips. Vicky L rightly coined our sentiment as \"We wanted chips with our shake, not shake with our chips\". \u00a0She also had a bizarre plan of dunking hot chips in cold milkshakes, which went out of the window. Slowly it dawned on us they had forgotten our milkshakes but it was too late, most of the blooming chips had gone. \u00a0When I pointed to the waitress they had missed something, she asked us what we wanted to do, Much to my boyfriend's intense embarrassment I suggested we get the drinks on the house. I must have spent far too much time with my Mum's boyfriend who once after some intense food waiting negotiated (to my shame at the time) a whole meal for free. I am actually surprised our waitress didn't automatically offer us the drinks complimentary, but she obliged when asked with no quibbles. However my boyfriend's reaction made me think I had overstepped mark with my cheek, and added extra guilt with my shake.Despite the additional bitterness caused by poor service and embarrassing interactions, it was still thick, yummy chocolate and peanut butter shakey-goodness \u00a0Minor quibble, it could have done with a wider straw as it kept getting clogged up but I think I've moaned enough in this review.Vicky L also pointed out a filth encrusted lamp on our table, and most the toilets were out of loo roll. A lady in one of the toilets kindly passed me a few sheets of paper, and then said \"I really should go get some loo roll - I work here!\". I never saw her go back in.I wasn't super impressed with The Diner, but overall it was OK. As a late night dinning spot it does mostly what it intends to, and in the right state of mind I would go again.",

Their menu is HUGE. They have everything, from hot dogs, burgers and plate of ribs to all day breakfast items like french toast and egg florentines. You could probably think of anything American and find it on their menu. It really leaves you spoilt for choice. Naturally, I go straight to the pancake menu. I get the red velvet pancakes with cream cheese frosting and my friend goes for the classic blueberry ones. The pancakes come in stacks of three which is a good portion size. We also order waffle fries because who doesn't like waffle fries??! I wanted to love the red velvet pancakes, I really did. It looked amazing but the flavor just fell flat. It tasted like dry pancakes with red food colouring which was a shame because the cream cheese frosting was not too bad. On the other hand, the blueberry ones were glorious. They were fluffy, warm and bursting with fresh blueberries that it made the red velvet one pale even more in comparison. The waffle fries were tasty too although we had to keep repeating our request for more sauce. The portion is large and was very filling. The tap waters were also slow to come although our restaurant was less than half-full. A bit of a disappointing service to be honest. All in all, The Diner does a passable attempt at recreating the traditional American diner. The atmosphere is spot on but some of the food misses the mark in a big way.",

    "text": "The only thing that lets this restaurant down is the service. As we arrived, we were told that there would be a wait. Sure, no problem... but we were told by the surly waiter at the door that we were not permitted to wait inside and so would have to stand in the freezing cold until summoned. Unimpressed, we left to go somewhere else, but soon changed our minds when our stomachs dictated that we really wanted to try some of their lovely varied menu.As we returned, we were greeted by someone else that immediately led us to a table... right by the door where an icy wind kept us shivering. We were eventually allowed to move to another table, but only after we were asked twice within 5 minutes if we were ready to order - and were given a strange look when we said that since we had literally just been seated, we were not ready to eat.After that strange debacle, we ordered our food and then waited a reasonable length of time. When the food arrived, we were blown away. I found myself to be eating the best Philly cheesesteak that I had ever eaten. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place, purely based on the food. If the food wasn't as good as it was, I would be saying to avoid this place like the plague.",

The menu, decor and music all represented the diner experience that have had in the US. I ordered a Burger & sweet potato fries & a diet coke. The food was decent enough and arrived within good time. I would recommend you trying this place out.",

    "text": "It was just after noon and my colleague suggested getting some food. He has issues with gluten so it's always fun trying to find something he can eat that won't make him swell up.We also failed to agree on what meal it was, he was adamant it was still appropriate to eat breakfast, whereas I think 12ish is definitely lunch time!I jumped on Yelp! to see where we could order an all day breakfast and a burger and found The Diner!We sat in a booth and ordered some drinks. I made the tragic mistake of thinking a milkshake would be a good choice. After having an amazing Oreo shake at Byron, I ordered one from here expecting the same creamy goodness. It was super thick and possibly the sweetest, most sickly thing I've ever 'drank'. It also had a huge dollop of toffee/caramel sludge in it which kept clogging up my straw!The worst thing about the milkshake though was that it totally ruined my appetite. My burger with pulled pork and bbq sauce was unfinishable. It wasn't a brilliant burger either, the patty was all beef-no seasoning, and the bun was a soggy mess. I also ordered a side order of sweet potato fries, which were good, if a little salty, and would have been great to dunk in my milkshake if it arrived at the same time. (If you don't dunk fries in your shake, you're doing it wrong!)I'd probably go back again, but not in a hurry.",

    "text": "The Diner varies in quality, but the Camden branch is my fave.The shakes are second only to Byron. Yet the Diner makes up for that with the selection far outmatching. Their Pistachio shake for instance is just pure bliss.The food varies, but one thing you can sure of is that the diner will continually renovate it's menu to clear out things that don't work and introduce things that will ignite the food world. The DCB I had recently is one of those things. It stands for Diner Chicken Burger and it's a moist piece of buttermilk fried chicken topped with bacon, blue cheese, coleslaw and pickles. It's a masterpiece.Surely, if they can re-create more burgers touching this epicness they will have me as a customer after many more gigs in Camden Town.",

I ate everything on my plate, but my friend who's hangover experience had turned in the wrong direction was unable to eat much. His loss! Nice place, nice menu. I recomend!",

The food here is also great, and they do gluten free buns for those of you out there that are allergic/intolerant or just on a health kick.
