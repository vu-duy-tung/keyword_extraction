They pay attention to detail in everything, from service to food presentation.I am a Tate member, so I was a bit disappointed not to get the 10% Tate member discount off my bill. I was told they used to do, it but they stopped it.",

    "text": "Definitely an awesome option for lunch or dinner after checking out the museum. I had the fish and chips with a glass of wine and enjoyed every bit of it. The fish and chips was fresh and flaky and was served with the best sauces ever. I believe it was tartar sauce and mashed peas, which sounds weird to us Americans but was deliciously tasty and had just the right amount of acidity to give it a balanced, well-developed flavor. The wine list is varied and affordable, the view is stunning, the wait to get a table wasn't too long, and the service was excellent. I'd definitely make it a point to go back the next time I'm in London. Perfection!",

    "text": "Obviously, the great selling point of the restaurant at the Tate Modern is a bit obvious--it's in the Tate Modern. Perched on the 6th floor, it boasts breathtaking views of St. Paul's and The City. I had the pleasure to sit at a table at the north-facing windows, and watched the sun go down and St. Paul's light up. It was one of the best dinner views I've had in my time in London.A friend and I shared sandwiches and tea from this lovely perch, and I was blown away by my seafood and avocado cibatta. Service was very nice, this is a gourmet restaurant for sure, but the prices are very reasonable. It's mostly filled with tourists, and there can be a queue at busier times, though it's a lovely option for an afternoon snack after walking through the galleries for a few hours.I'm not sure I would normally have decided to come have a meal at a museum, but I'm very pleased I did. There are a lot of non-locals who visit the Modern, and it's definitely worth stopping in at the restaurant as well.",

The modern European menu offered plenty of choice, with the sea trout special going down particularly well. The wine list was a little short but there were some good wines available at reasonable prices (say from \u00a325). Carafes are available too. Deserts were a little disappointing, with a rhubarb cheesecake being particularly dull and lacking in bite. The view made up for it, though, as we watches the City skyline light up as the sun went down. If you come here you must get a window seat on the north side. Service was not so good. They meant well and were keen, but a little awkward and occasionally clumsy. A minor downside but otherwise a great place for a meal that is unmistakably London.",

We had the best view in the house and our cocktails were strong, vibrant, and helped us ease into the latter half of our evening.I wish that this restaurant had more vegetarian options. There is more you can do with vegetarian food than serve an array of vegetables tossed with a pasta, so I know they can do better. Since there was such a lack of options, both my boyfriend and I ordered the same dish. Dessert was decadent, but not the best I've ever had. The fact that was chocolate was a superb treat at the end of the day and gave me enough of a sugar rush for a walk after dinner. I suspect it's a good place to go if you eat meat, but I would really like to see them rise to the occasion of serving more options for vegetarians as so many restaurants in London really step up their game in this department. The service was attentive and I really cannot complain about it in the slightest. However, next time I will stick to getting drinks there and taking in the view. There are better places to spend money on dining.",

As a vegetarian the only vegetarian option was the potato dumplings of which they charge 14 pounds for. It is served in a bowl on a bed of tomato sauce. They only gave me 6 tiny smaller than the top half of a pinky size miniature potato dumplings. As this is your only vegetarian option I had no choice. When it came i mentioned to the waiter that this looked like a starter. Do you not believe vegetarians deserve to eat? The guest I was with ordered the duck and even her portions were miniscule. There was a half of a parsnip on her plate and 1 leaf of spinach. Vegetables don't cost much to serve a balanced meal with your well paying customers especially that are members of the Tate and support it. The view may be nice but you are truly taking advantage of customers. On top of this tiny portions there is an automatic 12.5% service charge. This is not dinner portions for the price you are charging. My vegetarian entree was especially disgraceful. I will be taking this up with a fair consumer board because I actually believe what you served me to be of such terrible value that it should be reported to a consumer board. My suggestion is to serve fair portions if you are going to charge what you do and find a new vegetarian option so that you do not starve your vegetarian guests. I should not have to order a starter to feel like I ate something for dinner.",

    "text": "The Tate Modern Restaurant gets a soid mention in my Fodor's travel book for London as a great place to see the city from. Since I was bumming around St. Paul's Cathedral I beelined it down to the Millenium Bridge and straight into the Tate.The Tate Modern museum is a must see whether you will be eating or not. Housed in an old power plant the setting is incredibly surreal making you feel as though you are in a movie. The layout is well planned and moving around from gallery to gallery is very easy. For the Restaurant goto the elevators and choose the 7th floor.The restaurant is the only thing on the top floor resulting in breathtaking views of north and south London. To the north is the Thames and then The City, to the south is more of South Bank. Getting a table on the North side is more of a challenge so if you are in a hurry be happy with a view of southbank.I am a Vegan so finding places to eat can be a challenge. I figured that since this was a Modern restaurant then they should be accomodating for me and I was happy to see that they did have a few Vegetarian dishes to choose from: The Mezze and a Pasta dish. After explaining to my waiter that I was Vegan he did point out that the Pasta is made with egg's and that some aspects of the Mezze plate has some dairy. He was more than accomodating though and explained that the Chef would remove anything with dairy.The resulting dish was respectable but a bit off balance with acids. I would have appreciated a few more Lentils since they removed a bit of the dish including the high cost Goat Cheese but still charged me full rate for the plate.I have gone with 3 stars for not having a Vegan dish on the menu but being accomidating. Please add at least one Vegan dish and I will gladly take it to 4 stars.Overall you cannot go wrong grabbing lunch at the Tate Restaurant, especially if you are less than vegan, but even Vegans can find something to smile about.",

Firstly the guy in charge said we might have to wait 'anything between \u00a0half an hour and 2 and a half hours' for a table. It was already 8.30 so in 2 and a half hours the kitchen \u00a0would have been closed ... as we dithered, a table suddenly opened up. So much for that, then. It was ridiculously busy so waiters were rather conspicuous by their absence - we managed to get some slivers of bread but no olive oil or butter. However when they did finally come to take the order they were very helpful and friendly. I had a rather nondescript pumpkin soup (not quite hot enough, not quite thick enough) and a sticky toffee pudding that again, was perfectly fine, but nothing that memorable. My friend said her fish was rather overcooked. The side vegetables - roasted carrots and some purple sprouting broccoli - were the best bit.",

The designers of the restaurant have missed a trick, the windows are higher than the table seating, so you really cannot see out of the windows when sitting down to enjoy any view, unless you are sitting on the high chairs near the front of the restaurant, so you are levelled with the high windows.The restaurant is on the 9th Floor of the The Blavatnik Building (the new extension at the back of Tate Modern). \u00a0It has a very canteen style, with wooden tables, in front of high wall, so hardly any views to look out while dining, but the food and service is excellent. \u00a0I suppose the designers assumed you would enjoy the views in the Viewing Gallery on the next flight up before or after dining. My friend had the soup starter of Califlower & Montgomery Cheddar and Califlower Cous Cous with truffle oil which was really smooth and delicious, a very full large dish, served with warm brown bread to die for. \u00a0I had the sea bass carpaccio, chilli, pomegranate, watercress, and sourdough, which really whetted your appetite with it's sweet and sour taste, and was extremely good. For mains, I chose the Braised Heritage Blade of Beef served with vanilla potato puree, autumn vegetable crisps and red wine jus. \u00a0A really tasty chunky, thick succulent piece of beef. So enjoyed this dish too. \u00a0My friend's Josper Grilled Hake, parsnips, spring onions and voilet potatoes was also very yummy. We both then had the apple and cranberry crumble with double cream. \u00a0The crumble came in an exceedingly hot dish, which we accidentally touched and burnt our hands, but we were warned. \u00a0The crumble was divine. \u00a0The whole meal was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Cannot fault Tate Catering. \u00a0But if you want to admire the views while dining, then it is not really the place to do so, unless drinking and eating at the bar.",

I'm a vegetarian but had to go pescatarian for lack of options although the food was fresh and well-made. The artichoke soup was my favorite! The salmon rillettes was close to a lox salad (as in tuna salad) and was good - it came with rye bread so I made a sandwich. The final dish was haddock with poached egg which was my least favorite. The egg was overlooked - came out like hard boiled - and the sauce was just meh. The cute waiter though was a doll and everyone else very accommodating.",

    "text": "Tate Modern Restaurant, Southwark - firstly, I agree that it is hardly a place to go to for food but if you are a mum who is trying to instil culture into your child, this cafe is a good choice for children, families or large groups of people. It turned out to be more than that. fish and chips - a good plate and decent size, and I have never loved mushy peas that much before. Shame it was not a lot on the plate.hamburger - the dreariest hamburger I have had in a long time, at \u00a314.50? a complete waste of money!spaghetti bolognese (children's portion) - little one finished her portion without difficulty so I am assuming she likes it.Food was decent apart from the hamburger. The service was very friendly and family oriented. They also cater to people who have food allergies.What was amazing about the place was the view. It was literally breathtaking. I miss the times when London used to have a low skyline with only places like the museum standing at only 7th storey could give such an iconic London view. We could still embrace that now and hopefully the PM May does not have hidden motives (although it would not be surprising if she did) to change London in the view of making Britain still as investible after the whole Brexit palaver.If lunch is not on the itinerary then have coffee or a drink to admire the panoramic view. I do wonder now, are coffee prices in museums in London expensive for that reason? I doubt that though as not many museums have this view.",

London has such a wonderful skyline, and we were fortunate that it was a beautiful, sunny day. Wow!They have a couple of set menu options but we chose to go with a main, a glass of red wine, and a side dish to share. We both ordered the Suffolk chicken breast with lemon and caper sauce, buttered leeks, broccoli, and a side dish of spring cabbage with lemon thyme and cream.Everything was very good. We both cleaned our plates.The service was a bit slow by American standards, but we ran into that just about everywhere we dined on this trip. It was also fairly expensive when you factor in the exchange rate, but we don't fuss over those things when we are on vacation. We may never get another chance to be here again so we always make the most of wherever we are. I say Go For It!",

    "text": "Well the Tate Modern has changed. New extension and lots of new places and spots around the building to grab a coffee and a bite to eat. The restaurant that used to be on the ground level at the front has gone and moved to the old buildings top floor where the slightly posher restaurant used to be. It's took us a while to find it and no one understood my questions about where the old ground level restaurant is now..... Confused you should be - the staff certainly were!! So eventually we found it and found ourselves being ignored by the two managers who were too busy looking at the computer screen to even acknowledge us. 'Shall we just sit then' I asked to which came the reply no please wait. Nice! We were seated in the much smaller than ground level space. Personally I don't like the aesthetics of the top floor very much. Table service was great but the managers example of constant chatting and ignoring clients meant it was chaotic compared to old ground floor service where the same manager had run things brilliantly for years. It seems he's gone?!?Fish and chips for my wife. Usually fantastic the chips were undercooked and the batter soggy. Risotto for me - rice too al dente, too salty. And then the bill. Forgot to show my members card, silly me, and then spotted we'd paid a donation to the Tate and nothing mentioned. Bloody cheeky. Honestly I was seething by the end. Tate I love you but this new extension seems to have caused some chaos across the board. Not good at all!!",

I got some scones (complete with preserves and clotted cream!), and the mister got a gigantic turkey, bacon and tomato sandwich. Seriously, the sandwich was gigantic, and it could easily feed 2 people if you add an appetizer or a dessert on top of that. The mister said the sandwich was only okay though...so only order that if you are uber hungry.I, however, quite liked my scones. It was buttery, not too flaky, and delicious. Their teas, which are Jing branded, are also of pretty good quality.On top of that, you get good views of the Thames, and we happen to be there around sunset. Woo :)",

The food was not exceptional but decent. It was a little on the pricey side, but since the museum is free anyway, at least splurge on dinner guilt-free!!!! Totally worth your money!!
