This particular evening started out at the Olympia on Kensington high street. It was closed and I got a phone call telling me I had walked too far. Ten minutes later I was at Holland Park gate shaking hands and inviting the scathing commentary on my sense of direction. Really though, if you had a lovely park named Holland would you put up a big sign that says \"Belvedere\" on the gate? That's just asking for trouble. The Castle welcomed us with open arms. Well, Mike the bar man did to be exact. With plenty to choose from on tap or in a bottle, somehow we went with Peroni. What surprised me more was that I didn't want to spit it out. It would seem that you lot get a much better tasting version of the stuff than us poor Canadians do because it's like drinking dishwater here. The atmosphere was quiet and intimate. It was smaller than I was expecting and as such we hung out in front in true chav fashion. There were cat calls, disapproving looks and a homeless lady accosted me for change while rubbing my arm in the process. It was surreal but a wonderful evening. It's the kind of place that I would gladly make my home away from home if I lived close by. Courteous and attentive staff. Lively characters in attendance. Good food and you never can quiet tell who will show up to entertain you with tales from touring the world.",

This became my local pub for a week while I was staying in the Hilton Kensington just down the road, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself every time I was there.Food is good, reasonably priced, and surprisingly exotic for a pub, I would agree with Saskia that the selection is verging on gastropub. The best part is, they do the food well whether it's straight forward fish and chips or the more elaborate mushroom risotto (my g/f ordered this one afternoon and I was really pleasantly surprised how good it was).Beer selection is ample and right up my alley, any place that has both Pauliner and Leffe Blonde on tap is going to have a special place in my heart as those are two of my favorite beers.Atmosphere is very relaxed, couches a plenty and a late 20s, early 30s crowd that is just there to relax and enjoy themselves. Perfect neighborhood pub type of feel for me, none of the 40 something construction workers getting hammered here.Perfect place for lunch in my mind, good food, casual atmosphere and reasonably priced. I miss it already.",

If anything it verges on being a gastropub (risottos feature on the menu) but it's done well, the food is nice and the atmosphere is relaxed. Local people come here for a drink with friends - simple as that.They do pub quizzes (call to check the night) and serve fruit beer too so that must satisfy at least a few of your requirements for a good mid week evening out.",

There's skateboards on the walls right next to old leather sitting chairs and a very mucky fish tank. I was chided by the barmaid for my grammar which really pissed me off even though I shrugged it off with my usual charm and civility. I think she was just trying to start conversation but it was an overly-aggressive way of doing it. They had an eclectic selection of beer, including some Japanese ones on tap which was nice but of course they were out of the one I wanted. I know there's stiff competition for pubs and restaurants in Holland Park but this place was trying to hard and, as a result, was empty on an otherwise busy weekday evening.",

There is also a dining spot around the back of the bar for larger groups. We came for a later dinner, around 8-9pm but it looked like the happy hour crowd was still hanging out and enjoying their time. Younger crowd mid 20s-30s. A casual laid back upscale vibe. The bartender was awesome! He took our order at the bar and took a moment to break away and check on us during our meals. Great guy! The food was fantastic, highly recommend their pies.

The chicken was better than fried chicken I've had in the States (and I'm American, so that's hard to admit). It was crispy and delicious without being overly greasy, YUM!",

Ordered the fish and chips and a fried calamari starter. Calarami was tasty, well cooked, not chewy and had a nice bright vinegrette with a slaw of some type, a little salty but still good. Fish was unknown white fish, tasty but not bad at all would've preferred a crunchier crust. Nothing was greasy, chips (fries) were decent. Had my first Camden Pale Ale and it was the highlight!",

Roasted Poblano peppers were well grilled with a strong pepper burst with each bite. The chips were well suited to my American tastes as they were well fried and crispy. The summer slaw was cream based and contained carrots, broccoli and spinach(I think). The slaw did not appeal to me but I'll credit that to my not being familiar with this dish.Service was excellent. Our server, Maria, provided us with a sampler of beers and we chose her favorite. Very nice pub experience.",

This place is really charming with super friendly, knowledgeable staff and they make awesome food. \u00a0I was in London for three weeks staying in Notting Hill. \u00a0After a long day of seeing the city I'd come back to the place for a drink and a bite to eat. \u00a0I actually ended up here three times during my stay. \u00a0Pretty good considering the hundreds of other places I could have checked out in the area. If I was a local this would be my regular spot. \u00a0Highly recommend the fish and chips and their Veggie burger! \u00a0Fun fact, it seems they typically have you order at the bar. So if you're sitting there on a crowded evening wondering why you cant get any service, its a tip worth knowing :)",
