I had breakfast here and found the spot to be an efficient and well-run establishment. My grapefruit juice also went down a treat. The menu is varied, the food cooked exactly as you like it without needing to send it back to the kitchen three or four times. I was here on a Sunday morning which was full of hustle and bustle but that was charming rather than annoying and I have a feeling that for a late lunch or dinner, the pace would be slower and the hustle and bustle minimised. A huge plus in my book - the tables here actually have space between them! Something not found often in this lovely city!",

I had the breakfast burrito and it was great (but I must admit the copious amount of red chilies was too much for me) and I sampled a friends fries and they were fantastic. A friend had the fruit plate and it was sizeable...rather than some other breakfast places in London where I notice you pay 5\u00a3 for a little bowl of what I call the undesirable fruit salad fruits - oranges grapes and grapefruits. The restaurant is spacious and has a skylight so if you're in the back it's still light. There are two big booths that can fit round eight people so it's good for groups. I live in the general area and can't wait to go back to try a Burger or a BBQ chicken sandwich...and I have a feeling it'll be as soon as next weekend.",

Balans have six types, and I opted for the bacon double with a blueberry pancake on the side.The benedict was passable. Probably a 7/10, which is really good for the UK. The hollandaise was slightly too goopy, but the quality of the bacon was top notch. They didn't serve it on a muffin, it was more of a ciabatta-esque slice. The eggs were perfectly poached and really good quality.The blueberry pancake was PERFECT. If I ever frequent balans again (I'm rarely in west London), I'll definitely go for a short stack.Great service, good coffee, lovely menu. Recommended. Go here over Giraffe unless you're wielding a couple of kids in buggies.",

And any place that serves brunch until 5pm is a winner in my books. Other options that we were salivating over included a tantalizingly spicy breakfast burrito, a massive plate of steak, eggs and potatoes (a very small kid was tucking into this with huge enthusiasm at the next table), eggs benedict (salmon option sounds good) and corned beef hash with eggs. Wow, writing about all these is making me feel like 5pm is indeed a great time for breakfast! Definitely going to be making some return visits here! Friendly, attentive staff and reasonably priced for the area (about \u00a310 for breakfast and coffee) - well unless you take a champagne cocktail with breakfast :-)",

The 'Eggs Benedict' which I devoured had the spiritual charm to it that Mrs LeGrand Benedict of Delmonico's Restaurant in the USA no doubt bestowed upon her original creation over 150 years ago. It was scrumptious and hit the spot!Not only that, the staff smiled constantly, never forgot us for a moment, as they often do in chains - all predicated upon if they recruit their people from Spain, Portugal or merely that salubrious seaside location, Clacton-on-Sea.We were served, ate, felt delightfully looked after and refuelled and were out of there in three shakes of a Lamb's Tail - and back in the office before the Editor even knew we were absent. How many Journo's can say that line quickly - three times.Of course I paid. Happily I might add.",

The interior design is very cool and hip. Would definitely go again.",

The staff are friendly and efficient, and the menu is quite wide-ranging, although a little light on vegetarian options. Brunch is good, however, and it's one of the few places a gluten-intolerant friend of mine can eat out with confidence. A better bet for lunch than dinner in my opinion. The only downside is that the tables are rather close together - great fun if you like eavesdropping, less good for a private or intimate meal...",

Even the egg is my benedict (comes in small and large serving--always a plus) was done to runny perfection. However, the hollandaise lacked in acidity, which is a food snobbery peeve of mine. Otherwise, an enjoyable meal. And the biggest plus of all: no queue at 11:00 on a Sunday. I think we've got a keeper!",

We visited on a Monday morning and honestly the place was pretty empty - only one other table for breakfast. We were greeted nicely right away and given the choice to sit anywhere we would like. The service was polite and attentive whenever we needed something. We both ordered the Soho Full English Breakfast. It came with toast (choice of white, wheat or whole grain), thick good cut bacon, sausage, potatoes, two halves of a tomato that were baked and some Portobello mushrooms that were grilled. Overall it was a good breakfast. They have a nice whole grain mustard on the table that went well with the sausage and a good ketchup (not the standard one) that was good on the potatoes. I missed the traditional beans though that go with a full English. The toast was really good and I ordered the whole grain. Overall it was filling, yummy and served fresh and hot. The only issue would be the eggs as we wanted them over easy and two of the four total served to us didn't run at all - more custardy. Not a bad place to stop in for breakfast before a day of sightseeing if in the Kensington area.",

It is located really centrally in Soho and in Summer they open the windows and have some tables outside where people can sit and chat and eat. We had the Bruschetti with goat cheese and tomato and they were delicious. They also make nice drinks. For me the interior was not really my style, I went here cause my friends chose it, but that is my personal opinion and it would not be fair to rate the place soley on my taste of interior design :-) definitely a solid choice if you are in the area but if you are looking for something more special and elegant this might not be the first choice.",

    "text": "You know when you have been craving something and finally find something that fills that craving??? \u00a0This is the story of that experience! \u00a0I like to think that I embrace the local foods wherever I go, however, sometimes you really just want a little taste of 'home'. \u00a0While I love the UK and think that people who say that the British food isn't very good have clearly not been to the right restaurants, as an American, there are some things that I do long for. \u00a0One of those... American pancakes.Just a couple of weekends ago, Work BFF (a fellow American) and I hit the road to try out some American pancakes and were pretty disappointed. \u00a0This past weekend we were in London for the NKOTBSB concert (I know you are jealous) and I was tasked, again, with planning our food experience. \u00a0One of Work BFF's requests was a brunch place for Monday morning. \u00a0In my Yelp! research, I found this place. \u00a0I read the reviews and we looked at the menu (increasingly, restaurants can score brownie points with me if they have a sample menu online) and decided to try it, but, as the British say, we were managing our expectations.When we arrived, it wasn't so busy we had to wait, but it seemed to have some regulars that were meeting up for their usual lunch/brunch. \u00a0We could choose wherever we wanted to sit, so we opted for the back of the restaurant as there was a skylight where the sun was coming in and we could get away from the noise of the High Street as the door opened and shut. \u00a0Our waitress was lovely, quick, and very attentive. \u00a0The menu... an indecisive person's nightmare... in a good way. \u00a0They have a breakfast portion of the menu and a lunch portion of the menu and the waitress also had some specials to tell us about. \u00a0Everything looked delicious and I was almost swayed from my mission of pancakes. \u00a0Work BFF was struggling to decide as she was set on having breakfast, but after taking a look at the menu, decided she might want lunch.When our waitress came back, we ordered, Work BFF the Cinnamon French Toast, and me the American Pancakes with bacon. \u00a0I did ask the waitress if I could have my bacon done a bit crispy she said, \"No problem!\" \u00a0Love it. \u00a0Our drinks (orange juice, an Americano, and two glasses of tap water... with ice) came promptly. \u00a0Honestly, we didn't wait very long before our food appeared... and not in a 'we're in a rush to get you out of here' sort of way. \u00a0I have posted a picture of our food... it looked almost like it would in the U.S.!!!!! \u00a0I say almost because usually pancakes are served with a bit of butter on top, but the pancakes were nice and large, golden, and FLUFFY... so fluffy I could die (sorry, I always think of that movie when I hear or say fluffy). \u00a0And the bacon... it was three pieces of crispy, streaky bacon!!!! \u00a0My level of excitement may have been equal to that of seeing the Backstreet Boys in concert the night before, hearing they were recording another album, and my favourite, Kevin, was coming back to the group... just sayin'.I poured the syrup on and went for a taste... HEAVENLY! \u00a0This is what I have been searching for! \u00a0I can stop searching for places to have pancakes! \u00a0They were delicious and I thought there was just the right amount on the plate. \u00a0They do skimp a bit on the syrup, especially with the size of the pancakes, but if you ask they will give you more, as Work BFF found out when she asked for more for her Cinnamon French Toast (which looked awesome with the strawberries and bananas on the side... she reported it tasted good as well). \u00a0We also discovered that the syrup was real Vermont Maple Syrup (Work BFF was able to identify the bottle from across the room), not that Tasty Treat Maple Flavoured Ice Cream Topping.Our waitress stopped to check on us a few times, which was nice that we didn't have to wave her down for anything. \u00a0And... for the enormous pancakes and bacon, it is \u00a36.25. \u00a0I believe I reviewed another restaurant for their three tiny pancakes and their cost is more than that! \u00a0And my Americano was \u00a32.40... under \u00a310! \u00a0Work BFF's French Toast was \u00a36.25 as well, and her orange juice was more than \u00a32.40, but she also had a massive glass of it. \u00a0This was a good bargain in our opinion (and we get paid in USD...)! \u00a0The search for the American pancake is over!",

Options for outside sitting (very limited) as well as many options for seats inside.Service: the servers were very kind, and funny. Unfortunately, I don't think there was enough of them for the Sunday morning brunch crowd. Service was awfully slow and they were running around like crazy. If I wasn't alone, it would have been better since I would have had someone to converse with. Although limited, my interactions with servers were positive and they seemed caring.Menu: menu is fantastic with many great options that had my mouth watering. Wasn't sure which to choose. Based off Yelp recommendations, I chose The High Society Eggs Benedict. Delicious! Went perfect with English Breakfast tea.Credit Card/Contactless is accepted.*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*",

    "text": "I absolutely fell in love with this place! It intrigued me when I found it here on yelp and it's conveniently 5 minutes away from where I stay in London. I love that they are all about indulging yourself so I know I can go there and not be judged for indulging myself on everything from their appetizers to their delectable desserts!  At first I ordered some Chenin Blanc and their Crisp Polenta. Their menu is divided up well so you can get a little or a lot and they even deliver some late night food too which I plan to check out next time! The polenta was fried in squares and on a bed of kale that was perfectly dressed in a red pepper dressing. While I was reading my book and savoring every last bite, two of my fellow flight attendants walked in and the staff was so nice about us joining tables and made sure we were comfortable and had plenty of space.  Since I was staying a bit longer I couldn't resist ordering the Pina Colada cheesecake. It was so smooth and fresh and to make it even better it has coconut sorbet on top, which in my opinion is WAY better than slopping some whipped cream on a dessert and calling it a day. I can't wait to have another layover in London so I can try out their red curry, salmon, and roasted cauliflower. They truly have something for everyone, and plenty of vegetarian options which I greatly appreciate! You should know in advance that they have a rewards card but they'll only give it to one person per table. Even more reason for me to venture out by myself, gotta earn that free cocktail.",

I figured I could have fun after spending 10 pounds (13 dollars) on each cocktail and I was just talking and laughing with a friend!

The ambiance was funky, had that dim lit hipster vibe. The walls had unique trinkets and beautiful candle pieces were lit throughout the restaurant. The service was a bit slow, taking quite some time that we asked if they had forgotten about us. We ordered just a single round of drinks, some bread and chips for the table, and then entrees. The chips didn't come out til half of us received our food, and there was quite an awkward delay for the last couple people to be given food that the first orders out had become cold. Cocktails are a bit steep, \u00a311 for a tiny, mostly ice glass. I ordered a slap on the rum; mixed rum cocktail with pineapple juice and mint leaves. The mint was constantly getting stuck in my mouth as I sipped it and that was kind of inconvenient. For food, this is where they deserve high stars. The crab pasta was incredible. A very expensive \u00a317, but it was to die for. Would we all go back? Probably not. But it was a fun night with great people.",

    "text": "Breccie is the most important meal of the day..I agree ..that is why I chose here.Ducking under the blue velvet curtain, we were immediately seated by a lovely waitress. The decor was fab and quirky. Unusual art lined the walls, a large melted \u00a0stalactite like candle dominated the counter, and at the far back a large white painted tree.The menu synced with the decor. I.e creative. From kedgeree to fluffy pancakes, salmon and steak.So at 10am a lobster, avocado, salmon and bacon poached eggs was ordered..and a hair of the dog cocktail to wash it down..oh and a flat white. My friend ordered the crispy bacon, poached eggs on sour dough with the pineapple swizzle.Little things like the freshly made condiments served in archaic bottles gave it that extra special touch.When the food arrived , it tasted good as it looked. For \u00a313 mine was worth every penny..the morning after cocktails made with lemon and absinth also hit the mark..and the flat white was perfect.The service was faultless throughout and overall I really enjoyed my experience here. \u00a0You must come here for breccie!!!",

A great combination - proteins, carbs and salt :) All you need for a good start in the day.Together with a deep flavored but not overwhelming coffee americano, it was a perfect start into a sunny Sunday ! P.s. the self baked bread is amazing",

    "text": "Balans is a great place to meetup with friends for drinks and/or dinner. It's hip vibe creates a very cozy atmosphere and the drink/cocktail menu is extensive. If you're a member of their club, then cocktails are buy 1 get one 1 free during happy hours. We all had the Negroni, which was the perfect balance of alcohol with a touch of sweet, garnished with a fresh, juicy orange slice. The interior space towards the front of the restaurant isn't huge, so be careful of the one table next to the stairs that go down to the toilets as you can faintly smell the toilets from a couple of those seats!Service was great - prompt and very friendly. It took a few tries to get the right number of drinks at our table for some reason, but they got there eventually with a few reminders. Prices are reasonable and pretty much what you'd expect for the delicious quality of cocktails that they serve!! Though we didn't order food, all of the plates that passed me on their way to other tables smelled wonderful!",

This is enough to make me give anything 5 stars. Secondly, I had just moved to London, so I was feeling pretty on top of the world (you know, before the whole \"why are there SO MANY PEOPLE and WHY ARE THEY ALL NEAR ME\" thing set in. Thirdly, I had two glasses of Champagne, making it pretty hard for me not to be exceptionally happy at this stage. \u00a0I ordered a burger. But this wasn't just any ol' burger. It was THE burger. The Infamous Balans Burger (cue Western music). Swiss cheese. Bacon. (Crispy Bacon!). Tomato. Dill Pickle. Red Onion. Surrounded in the arms of a brioche bun. Cusped by the sweaty palms of triple.cooked.chips. And to top it all off, a big hunky knife stabbed right down the middle. All companied with a quaint wooden box full of homemade looking jars of sauce and stuff. The staff were friendly, efficient and the atmosphere warm and happening. We sat outside beneath the heater (best of both worlds) and were happy. Oh so happy.",
