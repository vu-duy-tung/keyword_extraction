As with all cheap eats, some are damn tasty, whilst others leave you passed out with your head in the toilet bowl. Cay Tre definitely falls in to the first category! The food is certainly tasty, portions are decent and the price is reasonable. The one downside (and really, it's a positive) is that there are so many tasty sounding dishes to choose from, that sorting through the menu gives me a headache. On my last visit we plumped for some Vietnamese spring rolls (standard), belly pork (really nice), aubergine and pork (mmmmmmmm....) and clay pot cat fish (really great sauce, slightly 'fishy' tasting fish). When we turned up, there was a 30 minute queue. What I really like (which is something that London restaurants should do more) is that they took my phone number and said they would call when my table was ready, meaning I could wait in a pub across the road, and not in the cold. So if you're after Vietnamese food and you can't afford the airfare to Hanoi, Cay Tre is a great substitute!",

I love the food. Nothing is as warming and soothing as a nice bowl of Pho of a morning. However Cay Tre's strengths really lie with the starters slash/appetisers. Sharing these with freinds is a joy. The summer rolls, the Viatnamese pizza, the beef in betel leaves and the theatre of grilling your own food at the table made for a great meal.The decor is quirky and even though the service can be a touch slow I find all the waiting staff friendly and eager to please. This is a shoreditch keeper for sure.",

The menu at Cay Tre is very very similar, but they don't have the Feudal Roasted Beef which is a MUST at Viet Grill. A Lotus Stem Salad (on both menus) was fresh and zingy, but a pomelo salad with herbs was way too heavy on the herbs. And an order of shrimp cake was all batter on not enough shrimp. But still, the food was generally very good. And reasonably priced. There was something approaching chaos at the front door, with no record of a booking for a party of four (they were shipped off to Viet Grill with promise of a 10% discount, but given that they'd claimed to be full, I wonder what happened...). The main problem with Cay Tre is to do with the ambience. I ate downstairs in the basement and the noise level is absolutely INTOLERABLE. I've never experienced anything like it. I wished I'd gone somewhere else - I couldn't enjoy the meal for a second. It was like a kind of punishing art noise-oriented art installation. They really need to put some softten some of the surfaces to deaden the sound. I'd absolutely use them for a take away as there are some dead cert wonderful dishes. But I won't be eating-in again... I'll stick to Viet Grill.",

    "text": "Cay Tre is one of my favourite restaurants in London. I go to Song Que for cheap and cheerful, but if I want a nice leisurely dinner.. I go to Cay Tre. There is an excellent spread to choose from, and they do excellent seafood dishes. I've tried the famous La Vong grilled fish, and would highly recommend that when you have a table of 2 and up. The waiter will come to your table to cook this starter for you, and it is all very exciting while you look on in anticipation. Your tastebuds won't be disappointed either. For something different, I'd recommend the cat fish - I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was done.. topped with a sweetish gravy of sorts, the flesh is tender and moist. I've never had anything like that anywhere else.. That said, I'd avoid simple noodle dishes like the pho, as Song Que does it better. The beef pho at Cay Tre is a little bland, and portions aren't as big as Song Que. They do a starter portion, but that is hardly worth ordering. I'd recommend Cay Tre if you want to order dishes (that go with rice). Otherwise, if you're just in for a quick bite.. I'd rather go to Song Que, where noodle dishes are their speciality.",

I've given it 4 stars as I really liked the lemongrass pork bun noodles and the crab rolls. They were both superb. The pancakes was slightly disappointing and I feel that Song Que's version is much better. Here's the controversial bit - I thought the beef pho broth was initially quite tasty and I could smell and taste some of the spices. However, after the meal I and my wife were extremly thirsty. My personal view is that it's possibly got too much MSG. Unfortunately my wife didn't feel well after drinking most of the broth but I was ok as I'd only had a few slurps.",

In addition, the country boasts a very diverse landscape which means different regions utilizing the local fruits and veggies making Vietnam a culinary adventure with tons of fresh, amazing foods no matter what part of the country you may find yourself.Within this context, it's no surprise that a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in this city, (especially the overrated shops on Kingsland Road) don't really measure up . The exception, of course, is Cay Tre. I had seen people queue up to get in this place for a long time, making a mental note to pop in on a less crowded night. This rarely happens. I managed to squeeze in at 11pm on a Friday and 9pm on a Sunday (hardly prime dining time in this city). I fully understand why there is always a queue. This is the best Vietnamese I've tasted outside of Vietnam itself. I particularly like how they point out in their menu various dishes that are local specialties - so you can get an idea of regional favorites throughout the country. I also like that they boast an extensive and detailed wine list - it turns out Vietnamese food pairs well with a variety of wines. And finally, this food is so fresh and delicious, it's a must for anyone who loves this type of cuisine.",

By in between I mean nice enough so they can command a higher price and attract white people (or more appropriately, not scare off people scared of sketchy-looking Asian places), but not SUPER expensive and high end like, say Nobu. This usually means higher prices for more mediocre food. I usually prefer the dives with great cheap food or the really amazing worth your money type places. While Cay Tre looks like one of those in between places (nice ambiance, white people eating there, long lines, well dressed staff, stylish, etc), the food was surprisingly solid. I had the Hanoi Pho, and the broth was good. Not as good at Pho 14 in Paris, but really solid. The small bowl is REALLY small. Get the large unless you just want a snack. Worth your time and money, especially if you're bringing a friend who is skeptical of Vietnamese food or never had it before. You won't have to worry about odd ingredients common in \"authentic\" Pho, like tripe. No tripe here. A nice balance of accessible and authentic. \u00a0*sluuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrppppppppp*",

    "text": "This is one of my top ten favourites in London. I should also disclose that I'm Vietnamese, born in Vietnam and therefore grew up eating lots of Vietnamese. The chef here is good. It's mostly authentic Vietnamese but with modern touches - but the modern touches make sense and makes the food tasty. Dishes have been designed to bring out the flavours in the ingredients, the ingredients are fresh and sensibly combined and the dishes are cooked fresh. Prices are very reasonable. The pho is one of the best in London. Up there with Song Que and Viet Cafe. I know some purist will say this is not 100% authentic Vietnamese due to modern touches. Although I generally love authentic food and usually prefer it, I prefer good tasting modern food over bad tasting authentic food. Authenticity is over-rated in many cases.",

    "text": "Excellent place! I hardly give 5 stars for any place (and I have reviewed quite a few), but this place has the right combination of value and amazing food. Usually places fall into one or the other, but this Vietnamese restaurant falls into both categories. I highly recommend the Indochine beef (although onion haters would do well to stay away). The soft spring rolls are good, not too salty and very fresh. The catfish was nice too, but the sauce is very salty and it is best to order some rice to go with it! We also had a bowl of beef Pho to end our meal (you have to have Pho when eating Vietnamese!) and it was good. It wasn't as flavoursome as the one from Pho in Westfield, but I suspect they use MSG or flavourings in Pho, whereas here it feels more homemade and original. Service was also very prompt even though it was a crowded Saturday evening, and the food came quickly. I will definitely be bringing my friends back here again!!",

    "text": "This was Pho-Tastic.Actually my first ever time having Pho and will not be my last. I had the \"Bun bo hue\" meaning the imperial capital's spicier versionof \"pho\", made with round white noodles, lemongrass and whole chillies and in my case Beef.Soooo delicious. Amazing flavorful broth. I've never had anything like it. The lemongrass and the chillies together gave it quite a unique flavor that I don't think would be too spicy for anybodies taste buds, but was PACKED with flavor. The beef was cut nice and thin and soaked up the broth nicely. My only complain is that the noodles while cooked perfectly seemed immune from soaking up any of the flavor. Pull them out of the tasty broth, they were as white as snow!There might is some crazy Vietnamese technique where they combine spoon and chop stick usage to pack both in one bite, but I could not figure it out.BIG TIP: The small portion of this Pho was 4 pounds(pretty good deal), but the large is only 6 pounds and I'd say it is 3 times big. Splurge and take the extras home for takeaway/.I will back to try more of the menu asap because I am already craving some Pho.Soo close to 5 stars(and could be soon)!",

    "text": "As a massive pho addict I need a fix every couple of weeks and searched for a half decent place nearby. I couldn't wait to taste some traditional broth. Unfortunately, \u00a0what I was served by my very efficient waitress was rather pitiful. I ordered the pho classic and asked for it 'tai' which is just the rare sliced beef instead of all the fatty other bits. When the warm ( not hot!) broth arrived i was disappointed to discover it was bland and oily. No amount of basil, fish sauce, lemon or hoisin could make it taste as good as many other pho's i've eaten in the past. Not to mention my noodles were overcooked and the sliced beef looked a lot like minced beef. It's like they reheated a bowl from earlier in the day or something. Granted it was after 9pm and maybe they were running low but the broth should be tastier the longer it's left. As I was starving I just ate the noodles quickly so I could rush home to watch the Usain Bolt race. I check the bill and am suprised to see a 1.19pound charge on top of my 9pound bowl of crappy pho. Ask the waitress what the charge was for but she was unable to explain and asked to speak to another waiter and he said it was for a tip. Since when do Vietnamese restaurants force you to tip??? I let him know the pho was far from good and he said ok don't have to pay for the service charge. I don't know if anything else is any good in the restaurant but I definitely wouldn't go there for their 3/10 bowl of pho.",

The good thing is about it, it is in fact on of the best Vietnamese in whole London. The bad news is, that I can not resist going there all the time.Lets describe this place to you. There is always a queue outside of the restaurant willing to wait up to 20 minutes until a table gets available. If you go in a group I recommend making a reservation. Spying on the customers, there are lots of Vietnamese business people choosing that Vietnamese place as their favourite.The decoration is more stylish then the other Vietnamese restaurants at Kingsland Road. They have wallpaper, which looks like a drawing from an artist especially commissioned. Little colourful lights are randomly placed all over it.Now here is a list of recommendations:* Mackarell fish* Vietnamese spring rolls (not the fried ones but with fresh vegetables)* Chilli pork chop with rice and vegetablesCay Tre likes to pride themselves of their numerous won awards, I have to say, this is deserved! As with me, I usually do not eat there, but rather order a take away, which costs me \u00a35.50 for a chilli pork chop, rewarding myself after a hard day of work - what better then having my favourite food is ready in 5-10min!",

It's retained it's quaint charm even though it's heaving pretty much every night of the week and the food is very very reasonably priced - and great quality too! The only thing I would complain about is that because it's quite a small restaurant you have to share a four person table with another couple if there are just two of you - which is sometimes a bit annoying if you want to have a private conversation but this is just a tiny thing. Normally there is such a buzzing atmosphere no one is going to be listening any way :)",

Also when they cleaned the table next to us, they wiped the pieces of food onto my legs. Pricing wise- \u00a0I thought 6.50 for 2 tiny chicken wings was crazy expensive.

After exclusively having their pho for about two years now, I finally decided to switch it up and what a treat it was!We ordered the piggy aubergine (so soft it melts in your mouth & it definitely had that great caramel quality you get with Japanese miso aubergine. Maybe a little too sweet, but still yummy!)The salt and pepper squid was also stunning. Light, crispy skin and cooked to perfection - so tender and not a hint of chewiness. The spring onion, garlic and chili stir fry it comes with, ah that will blow you away! I don't know what makes it taste so good (MSG? Oops) but it is so fragrant!!! I really wanted more :(We also had the mango sea bass and it was almost like a mix of both. Fish cooked really well, crispy on the outside but firm and juicy on the inside. With sliced mangoes and a similarly sweet sauce (again, really very very sweet).The two of us shared all that and a bowl of egg fried rice (definitely a sharing portion), and we left having spent about \u00a315 each, feeling pretty darn satisfied.

The seafood pho is great, lots of seafood, large portions. However getting anything with chicken is a world of pain. Somehow the chicken they used are the scrawniest of the bunch, thus lots of bone. Plus seem like the discarded bits of meat. It's still tasty, but as much as eating plain rice with sweet and sour sauce. Not impossible, but unsubstantial. Leaving you hungry when leaving.The place is quite small and cosy, making a winter lunch visit very pleasant. The aroma of the food drifts through the restaurant. Just make sure you order a pho dish, preferably seafood and have a little more than an hour to have your meal (service is slow as a result of the busy lunch rush).",

My friend got the campfire steak and it is delicious. The right amount of sauce where it's not overly salty and the beef is very tender. It also comes on a firing plate which is a great presentation.

I had the house pho or traditional (I forget what it's called but it had 2 kinds of beef). It was absolutely delicious. The broth!!! Wow. \u00a0I'm from the states and I've had pho before but it always seemed so bland to me. Not this bowl. I go to London 1-2 times a year and now Cay Tre will be on my MUST list.

I have taken so many friends here - during the day, at night and recently I ventured to their new branch in Soho - owned by Vietnamese Kitchen they also have couple of other spots around Shoreditch.On this occasion it was going to be the original venue. Naturally with these places with so much good food you have to order to share, but the portions are so generous it's a good effort to get through one main, nevermind sharing two!We went for the Butter Fish Curry with jasmine rice and the Bun Sa noodle bowl.The Butter Fish Curry is made with dried tamarind, coconut milk & red curry and is so intensely comforting and the spices are so harmonious you just feel like a better, happier person for eating it - dramatic but true.In contrast, the Bun Sa is a refreshing zingy and clean, noodly mouthful! A huge bowl of vermicelli \u00a0rice noodles, cucumber, bean sprouts, mixed Vietnamese herbs, crispy shallots, peanuts, nuoc cham with saut\u00e9ed lemongrass and rather meaty red sea prawns.A seriously authentic place for some fresh and mouthwatering Vietnamese that's well within budget.

So, I got really drunk on their awesome party punch, but didn't think very much of their food.There is nothing wrong with the food at Cay Tre per say, and as others say, it is the perfect place to fill a hole when out around old street. \u00a0However, with so many around this area, Cay Tre was never my first port of call (see Qui Viet point). It's fine. It's kinda tasty but very rough around the edges, and the menu never really appealed- it sits in this weird area between really cheapass vietnamese food and slightly more \"refined\" vietnamese food...We shared a wrap & roll platter, some soft shell crab and the piggie aubergine. \u00a0It was all fine, but nothing to write home about. \u00a0Basically if I never came back, I would never miss it. \u00a0It's not so bad I have an opinion about it, but it's not so good I would choose to come back either.Service was quite dicey but expected the week before christmas and also we were a party of 16.P.S.

    "text": "In my quest for the perfect pho, I've found myself in cay tre... Not for the first time. I'm looking for my perfect bowl and I'll be fair, cay tre does come pretty close. In my pho reviewing career, probably the closest.The pho is always perfectly cooked, it is smooth, but not overcooked. The toppings - whichever one you go for are also on point. My litmus test is usually the beef balls - I like it with some tendon and elasticity, the beef balls are great here!! The soup is flavourful and abundant, I just have to drink all the soup after a satisfying meal. So far so good.So why four stars? Firstly, my generic frustration with London is why we charge extortionate fees for bowls of soup noodles. I'm sure this resonates with most. I understand the margins and so forth, but let's admit it, the bull of your pm should come from drinks. Leave the food alone. Anyway, secondly, pho would probably tip the 5 star mark alone, a bit more herbs and bean sprouts on my herb plate is really all I ask. Lastly, the sides that I've had are a bit hit and miss. I personally prefer the summer rolls in city caphe over the summer rolls at cay tre. They skimped on the vermicelli and meat and overdid the herbs. I ain't no herbivore. Having said that, I've had this wonderful 'piggy aubergine' in old st cay tre which was deliciously meaty and vinegary. Yum.I do like cay tre and in a world of expensive pho and overcompensating (to the point of rude, you know who I'm talking about, Song Que) Vietnamese restaurants. For now, find me in Cay Tre.",

A Vietnamese place that is unique it doesn't need to be on Kingsland Road amongst all the others fighting for your attention.When you enter you realise it's much smaller than you anticipate. The outer signage seems very, well, tacky in truth. But no matter we're here for more than just that.In terms of space inside it's quite crowded and close knit. You'd often find yourself squeezing in next to other diners. Food was good. Very good if washed down with some proper Saigon beer. I think the quality may have dropped a tad from when I first ever went as well as rising prices due to popularity. However the food was indeed good.Spring rolls, mango salad, chilli salt pepper squid, even had a table griddle beef (tho this was very tricky as table we had was tiny! - prob wouldn't try that again), as well as a Vietnamese red duck curry. All personal favs.All in all. Very good. I'm always a bit disappointed with the pho in London so haven't ventured back to any restaurant to try again, including here but maybe next time I will be adventurous.",

I've gone here twice with my colleagues and you get really large tables to dine with a big team if you want. The staff is friendly too and items on the menu are pretty decently priced. Some funky cocktails too. I remember having the wok roasted beef with rice and vegetables. I also had some spring rolls and a cocktail that I don't remember the name of, which contained a mix of some champagne, aloe, mint, lime etc. But I did have an unforgettable experience here as I almost passed out after my lunch. It certainly wasn't the food. And it was probably an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients that I had which I'm still not aware of. But this was the day I got into an ambulance. Thanks to my colleagues for quickly getting me an ambulance. I could barely breathe and I struggled to stay awake. But I was back to normal in about 20 minutes. Thanks to the medics and my friends. I think I caused the restaurant some bad business that day, as this happened soon after I had my lunch and bill was cleared. So they helped with dealing with the emergency and despite this incident I did drop by to apologize for the loss of any customers. They were very kind and asked me to take care and consult a doctor when I can. But you know London, it is hard to get a GP appointment. But I can say for sure, literally, that was a lunch to DIE for. At least that's how my colleagues describe it now.",

Interesting... considering this restaurant is constantly packed, completely overpriced, and must be doing well! You actually cannot move or walk because it is so cramped, you may as well be sitting on your neighbor's lap.

Both were delicious! A true testament of a good Vietnamese restaurant is it's pho - without a doubt it's one of the best in London. The pho bo was served with several different cuts of beef in deliciously fragrant broth. The summer rolls were expertly rolled - hardly anything dropped out of rolls when I doubled dipped them in hoi sin sauce. Although the hoi dip was tasty it traditional to serve summer rolls with fish sauce dip.Cay Tre's sister restaurant in Soho served one of the best pho chicken (pho ga) I've had - trust me, both my parents are Vietnamese. So far, these are only 2 Vietnamese restaurants I've enjoyed eating at. The portions are smaller than one would expect but nonetheless yummy!My recommendations:StarterPrawn summer rolls MainPho bo (beef noodle soup)",

We then ordered some replacements and the same thing happened with that. I then asked them what they had on the menu so it didn't happen again and the waitress was slightly rude back, walked off then came back and we finally finished our order.Food came, it was good but not the best I've had. They threw the dishes down in front of you and ran off.Overall service needs improvement and the general layout needs updating so you don't feel like sardines.

Nothing go back for. We sat in the basement which was loud at times and service was a little slow. However the wine and beers were nice and complimented the food well. This place has potential but the food wasn't good enough to make a lasting impression or entice me to ever come back. Portions were larger than expected.

And more over, it's damn fast, you receive the menu, 5 minutes you order it, 10 minutes max you get your food, out in half hour.

I was pretty set on the Classic Pho, so that was fine, if not preferred. I'm not a huge fan of chatty waitresses. The girl that waited on my table was very nice, and very efficient. The pho was phenomenal. First off, it got to my table incredibly quickly, before my drink had. I'm not going to try to make out like a pho expert, but I've had good pho and I've had bad pho and this was excellent pho. The beef was thinly sliced and delicious, the broth was just the right amount of salty, and the portion \u00a0was huge. Absolutely worth \u00a39.50",

The stress continued as I frantically searched on my phone for how to pronounce \"pho\" (no connection between this and me dining alone, obviously). Is it fuh? Is it foe? I tried fuh and then the server repeated it back to me as \"foe\". WHAT?So yes, this was my first pho experience. The beef was well cooked and tasty and although I wasn't sure exactly how to add the herbs, lemon etc that came with it, whatever I managed to do with them had a delicious result! Little bit on the expensive side for lunch, really, and I don't find broth particularly filling but I left feeling more or less full and I'm sure I'll be back to try the other options. Service was attentive and friendly. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the decor was quite nice - maybe it's been updated? Maybe I just have boring taste?",

We loved the seafood sampler of prawns, crab and squid - fried but not greasy and tones of chilli. The roll sample comprised of dumplings, glass noodles and egg rolls.

I took a bite of the noodles and was impressed of the taste because it tasted very homemade and fresh (we didn't ask if it was). Their Vietnamese coffee was also sweet wish it was a little stronger. All in all, I enjoyed my experience -- the staff were really nice and kept us in the loop with the wait time of our food. If I'm in London again I would come and support them again. The only downside is the pricing - I think I spent $16 total which is a lot for a Vietnamese restaurant... but again, we ARE in London!",

There is no lack of additional chilli options. There are the standard pho like beef and chicken (including the ultra safe pulled chicken breast) and then all sorts of variations. The beef in the traditional pho is fall apart and really perfectly cooked. But they all need a touch more soy/oyster/vinegar ? fir some extra flavour. The menu is huge and there is lots of well gentrified Vietnamese items to share and snack on. I love love love the crab rolls and the tofu aubergine is delicious. There is a single scallop which is unsharable (it's big but I don't believe in sharing scallops) as one bite wouldn't be enough. There is definitely a 'proximity to old street' tax on the food so if you want something a bit cheaper go around the corner.But it's pretty alright with a good vibe! Do the big menu sharing!

Especially for pho in England, and the Bun Thit Nuong was also pretty tasty. The BBQ pork in the bun was perfectly cooked and seasoned but I didn't like the nuoc cham (fish sauce) because it wasn't strong enough, and they don't serve it on the side! Ambiance: it's extremely loud. The music was uncomfortably loud for a Vietnamese restaurant. Because the music is so loud, you pretty much have to yell to be heard.Service: horrible. We were asked to move to a table upstairs midway through our meal. Thanks, but no thanks.In short, come here for the food. Don't expect good service or a quiet meal.",

If you like spicy pho, I definitely recommend adding the peppers at the table into the pho. They are very good and very spicy! As for the seating, they have a few tables upstairs and downstairs (basement). We were seated much sooner, because we were okay with sitting downstairs. The ambiance is much better upstairs, because it is brighter and much more lively. Nonetheless, there is nothing wrong with sitting downstairs, if you are just looking for good pho.",

There are a few Vietnamese restaurants on the same road but this one attracted us as there was no queue to get in, there was extra seating areas downstairs, and the food look great through the window!  So we walked in and was greeted by a member of staff who asked if we were eating in or takeaway and as we had se time on our hands we ate inside. Probably not the best place to go after having a heavy drinking session as all we could drink was water, but I gotta admit the little jug of water with ice and a slice of lemon looked pretty!So to start off with we shared a Crispy Vietnamese vegetable Spring Rolls which came with some sauces, which was yummy and we could have ordered another but then came our second part of the meal which was a a plate of Wok-fried Ramen Noodle, which had oyster mushrooms, beansprouts, green onions, followed with Campfire Hanger Steak which is \u00a0cooked with oyster sauce, onions and the steak was very soft. Once we finished eating it did take the waitress a long time to realise we had finished and wanted to pay our bill as she had disappear for some time but we have been here again since the service was a lot better! Also loved the menu choices as there wasn't too many items to over complicate what to select!",

The prices reflect thi, it's a bit more than you'd pay elsewhere close by and it's not BYO (which many of the others are). BUT, and the important bit, the food is nearly always AWESOME. If you go here, you have to have La Vong grilled fish! It's exquisite. The dish is finished off at your table, where they pan fry it in front of you. The combination of monk fish (which is marinated in herbs and spices), dill, chillis, peanuts and the yummy pink fish sauce is excellent. Another great dish is the Campfire beef, and it is incredibly flavoursome. Both these dishes don't seem to be on many menus along the Kingsland Road establishments and often make it worthwhile to come here just for them. Only downside is the last time we were there we saw a teeny tiny cockroach which the staff didn't seem bothered about..other than that, it's always been great.",

Service-wise this place is great and all of the food smelled and looked delicious. As a disclaimer, I LOVE pho and am used to the pho dishes in the Los Angeles area (California, USA). I guess the pho in London is generally different from the pho in LA. It was just very very different from what I am used to. The broth is much darker/thicker and the noodles were different as well. They were extra thick, reminiscint of fettuccini noodles rather than thinner like vermicelli. I did not think that it was particularly bad, it just did not fit well with my taste-buds, especially since I was expecting the same kind of pho as I am used to eating back home.",

The first time I came here for takeaway, I was left very disappointed as the quality of food didn't match my expectations (many people had said to me that it's one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in London) but then I did get takeaway on a Sunday afternoon, so my order was probably the only thing going through the kitchen at that time. Anyway, I put my dislike aside and recently went in. We were lucky to get a table as the place was rammed. The menu is large but not too big that they give you 30 variations on the same dish, as some of it's Kingsland Road neighbours seem to do. Service is very very friendly and helpful. The crowd that evening was a mix of people in the know, office workers and a few couples trying to have a romantic evening (which is hard if you're looking for any privacy as the tables are set so close together!) Many of the dishes have a theatre to them, with burners heating the food or additional preparation being done at your table. The prices are reasonable and the wine list fairly large, which I didn't expect. Second time round, the food quality was outstanding. I think my advice would be to go when it's busy (most of the time) and not when it's quiet (erm.. a Sunday afternoon!)",

The staff was somewhat \"professional\" rather than \"personal\" with us, but as mentioned before it is an extremely busy and popular place. Verdict: Probably the best meal for a tenner I ever had in London. All of East London seems to be in on it, so have a back-up plan on the weekend.

    "text": "Unashamedly bad serviceFirst, our group walks in, a group of 3 on a Sunday afternoon mind you. We receive the menu and almost immediately are asked if we are ready to order. We reply that we aren't, the other two in my group look very confused about the menu. They asked clarifying questions about nearly every item on the menu rather than the waitress volunteering to help walk them through it. At a certain point I decided to step in and just walk them through it myself. The waitress offerred to bring us prawn crackers (which never came). Finally, we ordered our food. When it came, one girl's food came almost 15 minutes before our food. She was almost finished eating by the time we got our Pho. Now, I haven't had much Pho experience in London, but I have in other cities, and this was far from great.Finally, after we finished our meal, we were owed a 3rd course (dessert) from the set menu. Again, after 15min or so of the waitress floating around nervously, she finally asked if we wanted the bill, to which I responded by asking if we were getting our dessert. She looked confused, went back to the till, and put in our dessert order, for which we had to wait another 10 minutes or so. Then came the most painful part... paying the bill.It was a simply manner of splitting 3 ways. A very simply request (asking to break a 20-pound note into 10s) became very complicated quickly. The waitress said she couldn't open the till without a purchase. I handed her the 20 and said, ok, then just give me two 10s when a purchase is made. Then she said she didn't have 10s. Fine. So I asked if we could split the bill 3 ways, and she said we couldn't. Finally I just gave up. I asked her what we could do to check out. She came with a card reader and asked who was going to pay. What??After 30 minutes of back-and-forth arguing, we (finally!) realized that, in fact, we COULD split the bill 3 ways. All this, and a 15% service charge tacked on to the bill for laughably crappy service and sub-par food.",

    "text": "Small, unassuming, you wouldn't really take notice of it when walking past, or at least I didn't anyway. Until one day someone took me here for a spot of what I thought was going to be a quick light lunch, but turned out to be a very enjoyable and indulging meal. We went a little crazy with our order and as per usual with me, over ordered. To start we had one of their salads and then Vietnamese spring rolls, which were served cold with the expected fillings of vermicelli and chicken and flavoured with chilli, mint, lime and fish sauce. Then we had their famous shaking beef fillet mignon, called bo luc lac, cooked deliciously with a spot of cognac and served with chilli sauce, a side of stir fried greens. The soft shelled crab we ordered was the weakest out of the dishes as instead of having a crisp bite to it, it came out a little soggy, but despite this it was still tasty.Cay Tre's menu is impressive and serves a wide, authentic range of true Vietnamese food. We came on a Saturday lunchtime near closing time, so there weren't that many people, which meant we had quick service. I hear that it can get really packed during the evenings on the weekend, so be sure to pre- book.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Cay Tre. I seem to remember that an Evening Standard food writer voted it in her top 5 restaurants in London. What makes this decision more interesting is that it is clearly based on food quality, not flash or expense. This is probably the most basic setting in which I have had a delicious meal. I have had so many good dishes here, they are all packed with fresh herbs and spices. It's a welcome change to the ever-present Thai explosion around London. Not that I don't love Thai, but Vietnamese food is really worth an exploration. The dishes generally are drier and less creamy than Thai, which also makes them less calorific. Sorry to sound like a typical girl, but these things are sometimes important! One of my favourite starters is the Vietnamese pancakes. Look out for the noodle and fish starter for two which is brought to the table by your waitress and prepared in front of you. If you like fresh fish, I would go for the oven baked mackerel for a main which comes wrapped in a banana leaf. You get the whole fish and it is monumentally cheap, about \u00a36.95. It's definitely true that you can eat like a king here, for a very small price. Well worth a visit.",

    "text": "Really refreshing experience. I went for lunch with a friend and would definitely try it again in the evening. She had a Vietnamese salad which was supposed to be a starter but was enormous and bursting with flavour. I had a gorgeous vermicelli one dish meal with crab meat and prawns which really filling, crunchy with fresh beansprouts and not remotely greasy (which some stir fried noodles can be). Highly worth a visit if you're near Old Street",
