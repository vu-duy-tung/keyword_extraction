First off, we did not have a reservation, and the place looked really nice, and since were were in comfy \"tourist\" clothes, I was a little nervous we would be turned away. \u00a0However to my surprise, the lovely and very nice hostess found us a table, and was very polite to us, and treated us just as if we were nicely dressed with a reservation. The look of the restaurant was very cool, sort of urban with lots of wood and metal textures. \u00a0All the staff was very good looking too, this is a trendy spot you can tell. \u00a0We got drinks and 3 courses. All were amazing, I highly recommend getting the scallops. I'm sure the menu changes, but when were were there they were topped with bacon and apples, in a carrot puree. Only reason why this is not 5 stars is b/c my entree was not so great. \u00a0I got pork belly, and for me at least the texture was a little off.However, if you want a chic date night with amazing service and great food - highly recommend checking out Bread Street Kitchen. :-)",

    "text": "I booked a table in advance for my girlfriends birthday. There's a certain amount of pressure that comes with booking a table for a birthday dinner: you kinda don't want to mess that one up by picking a place that will serve you microwave popcorn and flat coke. We arrived 45 minutes early and from that moment on the service was by far the best I've ever had in London. I was carrying flowers for my girlfriend and the staff immediately offered to put them safely away while friendly welcoming us to the restaurant. Even though we were early, they got us a table on the spot.The place itself is decorated with tremendous good taste and the tall windows all around make it feel gigantic. Our table was opposite the open kitchen but we never felt the rush of waiters running back and forward - everything was perfectly organised and if anything, it was impressive how they handle so many customers so quickly and with so much quality.Every member of the staff who attended to was was knowledgeable, fast and efficient. They made timely recommendations and were polite and friendly. The food itself was lovely. Perfect portion size, freshly made, fully flavored, great presentation. Strongly recommend the slow roasted pork with apple sauce (and top that with some delicious hand cut chips!). The desserts and coffee were also top quality, with the strawberry sorbet wrapping up a perfect meal.The price is what you expect from the place - around \u00a340 pp. But if you want to make sure you are getting your moneys worth then this is a very safe bet. 5 stars.",

I was feeling fairly budget conscious so I only ordered 2 sides, both of which were very tasty. The mixed beans in particular were v good - if a tiny bit overseasoned. \u00a0The juice I ordered was labelled as 'fresh' and when I asked if it was squeezed there the waiter got a bit confused. \u00a0It's not squeezed on site, be warned - in case you thought you were getting a truly fresh dose... \u00a0Loos are clean and kind of weird looking with mesh doors. \u00a0It would be interesting to see what the place is like during the evening... \u00a0I'd return, but ideally on someone else's dime ;)",

    "text": "I'll preface this scathing review by saying the food I received was delicious. Tiny and expensive, but tasty nonetheless.But that cannot make up for the rest of my experience.1. No one acknowledged me when I arrived upstairs despite the restaurant having just opened and therefore being empty of patrons and abundant in staff.2. The menus were being printed so were not given to me when I arrived. So I ordered a white americano while I was waiting. A flat white arrived. My companion's black americano came with milk on the side.3. 40 minutes into my visit, I had to ask after the menu. It was still being printed.4. I ordered an 'americano with milk' and the server asked me if I was sure I didn't want a flat white. No, I didn't want a flat white. I didn't want a flat white the first time.5. The menus arrived 10 minutes later - a good 50 minutes after the restaurant's opening time. This is not an exaggeration or misremembered in any way.6. The food arrived promptly, but for some reason we received complimentary bread after we'd nearly finished our meal.7. We were left waiting. And waiting. And waiting. We finally got up to request the bill after we'd been in the restaurant for at least 2.5 hours.8. At least two things on the bill were more expensive than they were on the menu, which - may I remind you - was printed at the beginning of the day's service. We were automatically charged 12.5% for service on top of it all. Galling.Never again.",

    "text": "Came here because we had a slightly bigger than usual party size and most of the posh-kind of restaurants only accepted party sizes of maximum 6 (or 7). :(Anyway, loved the interior and the general atmosphere of the place. The waiting staff were well-dressed, the bar looks friggin' awesome (they had to use ladders to reach some of the wine bottles) and there were microscopes (ones that you used in your high school science lab) decorating some of the tables. A really laid-back yet still classy kind of place that you can choose to dress up or down without feeling out of place. Location's perfect - somewhere in the City, close to St. Paul's and stone's throw from several high st. clothes stores. As for the food - like the amount of stars I've given - it's just A-OK. I've never had stomach for starters and am not a big fan of meat so I was pleasantly surprised by the fish choices - ordered sea trout and shared a side (mac + cheese). The sea trout was decently-cooked, nothing spectacular, and the broth was really salty so that made everything else slightly saltier than usual. The mac + cheese had a crunchier taste because of the fried onions but otherwise, it was a decent kind of mac + cheese (you really can't go wrong with mac + cheese). To get a varied and more unbiased opinion of the restaurant, I asked my friends what they thought of their meals, the one who I shared the mac + cheese with ordered sea bream said the taste was equivalent to catered hall food (which is seriously bad). another who had the cod fish said it was mediocre at best. LOL. Moral of the story, don't order the fish when you visit. :)Oh well - at least the bread served at the start was decent.",

Excellent sauce and a potato mash of some sort. Tasty but wouldn't order again. Sides: Greens were plain but just what I needed to compliment the heavy meal. Chips were delicious but could've used more salt. Bread and butter pudding - too expensive, delicious but seemed underdone. Tasted like what you would expect bread pudding to be. Nothing particularly too inventive. It comes out in a cast iron small pan, which means the dish stays hot forever and burns your tongue. A small price I pay for tastiness? Service: So. Freaking.

    "text": "We dropped by here on Saturday afternoon hoping for some post lunch drinks and dessert, when we reached the 1st floor we noticed (from reading the menu) that there was also a cafe/pastries/snacks area on the lower ground floor, so decided to descend there as opposed to dining solo upstairs. Despite a great mix of cocktails and drinks menu on the lower level, the nibbles available downstairs were limited, pastries were no longer being served in the afternoon; disappointing, and the staff informed us that we could not order from the dessert menu upstairs - despite there being a fully functional lift which would have made whisking down a dessert from the upper kitchen a breeze.I guess they don't want to go the extra mile for customers (yet)... maybe feedback like this will eventually make a difference...the olives and manchego cheese we did try were good, as were the cheesy risotto mushroom balls. We also tried some veggie squash flatbreads which were ok, but nothing to write home about.As for the decor its nice, but all very artificial, this isn't some converted industrial space, its made to look like it is, and the faux staining on the bathroom mirrors takes things a little too far. Also the fake candle bulbs on the lower bar are incredibly bright, we were almost blinded by the light every time we glanced towards the bar vying for the staffs attention..We cant really comment on the food as what we had was effectively tapas, that being said we will return to try the food upstairs, I just hope its a better experience than our first.",

Just a little bit loud-- not great for conversation, but luckily I wasn't in the mood for it. The menu was simple with a nice of range of options-- including veggie and seafood. I ordered the salmon ceviche and it was sooo yummy. The salmon was very thinly sliced, nicely salted, with just the right amount of citrus. It was not fishy tasting at all, but light and refreshing. \u00a0The portion was also quite big-- unless you're a very big eater, you could share this dish. For the main, I ordered the braised lamb. \u00a0It was a huge dish, really well cooked and nicely dressed. \u00a0Mashed potatoes on the side weren't memorable. FYI For halal eaters out there, the lamb is from New Zealand so you might be okay with it. Service was fine. All around solid and satisfying dining experience.",

Who would have thought such a big restaurant was hiding above a quiet-looking bar.We didn't have a booking; but there were plenty of space to accommodate us right away. The menu is small; but I believe that is totally fine. Many seafood dishes; but also grilled meat; burgers and others. I ate the roasted cod with artichoke, some sort of vegetable mashed potato and red wine sauce. It was lovely; but I have to admit that for the price, the portions were a bit small and althought it was good; it wasn't amazing.... It is definitely a place to order a two or three meal course.(Ps: it wasn't until I read the reviews here afterwards that I found out it was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant)",

First, we make reservations for same day at 4:00 (easy enough) but when we get there they tell us no kids under 12. We joked with the hostess the girls are almost 12 and we were the only group in the restaurant so she gladly sat us at the table they prepared for us. Kids don't eat much so they all ordered a side of mac and cheese. When one of the girls asked about the portion size of the mac and cheese the waiter rudely replied \"I can't tell you just like I can't say how many leaves of lettuce are in a Caesar salad\"! After ordering our food, we found out they do have a children's menu for 12 and younger! So which is it? If you don't allow kids 12 and under then why have a menu for kids 12 and under! Mr. Ramsey some of your wait staff need a lesson in manners and your people should know if you have a kids menu that kids 12 and under are allowed in your restaurant. Disappointed. Only getting 2 stars because the chef and his staff did a good job and were friendly otherwise it would be 1 star.",

Dinner time attracts business professionals and the young adult crowd. It is a very nice space upstairs. I loved the high ceilings and openness of the entire dining area. The ambiance is absolutely perfect here and definitely impressive and has a new york feel inside, However, i was a bit disappointed with the food particularly the surf and turf isn't the best. For appetizers we ordered the carpaccio (good), scallops (good), flatbread pizza (not that great)~For Entrees we order a couple of surf and turfs (was very disappointed in the thin steaks. Not what i would have expected. I had the Duck breast which was really good but needed more cranberry sauce. The duck was fantastic but just a bit too salty for me personally. BUT...the thick cut crispy chips (french fries) were by far the BEST i've had around town. I might go back for drinks and dinner just for the ambiance. It's a really nice space.",

Scallops were ok, but nothing memorable. In general, I have a problem with prawns in the UK (I'm American, I am used to shrimp with some size to them), so the prawn toast was covered in these tiny little prawns and a little crab. Flavor was good, but I'll never write a good review of prawns anywhere in the UK, so I'll give it a pass.For the mains I had the pork belly and my friend had the short rib burger. The pork belly was a generous portion and was pork belly perfection... crispy crackling and tender, moist pork. My friend loved the burger, and loved it. The down note of the meal was the mac and cheese... the macaroni was way overcooked, and I could picture Gordon Ramsey going nuts if he tried it or someone served it to him.The scene is really great there too... high ceilings and huge windows. I'd recommend it, but be warned... it is not cheap.",

Just through the invite, I knew how this would end up.This masterclass was held at the ground floor at the bar of the restaurant, and animated by 2 very talented and enthiusiastic barmen, showing us their secret tricks, and letting us try their fav' cocktails.Highlights of the evening in terms of cocktails:- 20th Century - a kind of deconstucted alcoholic lemon tart - very delicate. with a top mousse and a citric juice. Actually hard to describe but... BUT JUST TRY IT. It's one of the best boozy experiences ever- Harlem Hard Shake - okay, even if there is Jagemeister, caramel, ice cream and baileys, the mix just blends perfectly and makes a kind of nice alcoholic milk shake. Om nom nom.We were served with light pizzas and nibbles during our masterclass, which were pure delish of very simple, but fresh and good quality products.So if you're around St-Pauls and fancy a good cocktail, definitely a place to try out.",

We agreed to eat anyway since we had come all this way to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. This was supposed to be the most casual and newest one out of all of them.Pros:Beautiful RestaurantFancy FeelNice DecorationThe soup.Average:Decent ServiceEveryone well mannered and niceFood came out in a timely matterHighchairs are great to have, but not when they are only suitable for older kids. There's no leg separation insert, so a smaller baby could just slip straight through. Good thing we brought our own portable chair for our 9 month old.Cons:The food.There were 2 meats on the menu... Lamb shank and a roasted chicken.The rest was all seafood. We tried the mullet, sea bream, soup, chicken and one more other fish. All were over cooked and under seasoned. Basically not seasoned at all.The bread was pre toasted and sitting for a long time under a heat lamp, which led to very hard bread.2 pounds per person is added to your bill just for dining in.12.5% service charge is added to your bill on top of the already included taxes and fees.Water. We didn't request anything fancy. Just regular water from refilled glass bottles. 2 pounds per bottle... 5 bottles... 10 pounds added to our bill for regular water for 6 adults! We complained and had this removed.Other notes:Something else to note is that this place is really loud. For a place that is supposed to have a nicer ambiance, it is very very loud. You can barely hear yourself talking.The food, we expected to be more impressive and frankly it was disappointing. The plating was just ok.I wouldn't recommend this place unless you aren't going for the food.",

We received complimentary olive and parmesan focaccia, lightly salted, which was just fantastic. \u00a0I'm a big fan of hot buttered bread, and I can *almost* say that it didn't need the butter.. but I'm just gonna slab it on anyway. There was a special off-menu appy for the night, duck foie gras terrine with crostini, however they all ran out (and it was only 7pm!). \u00a0Slightly disappointing, but I was quite happy with the rest of my meal. To start, we had pan seared scallops (\u00a312), and the veal carpaccio (\u00a312.50). \u00a0I didn't get a chance to try the scallops, but my friend was quite happy with them, and they looked like they were cooked perfectly. \u00a0The carpaccio looked slightly more cooked than raw, but maybe I'm used to beef sashimi. \u00a0It was served with a quail egg, and a tuna dill pickle dressing. \u00a0The dressing was good - I sensed a bit of horseradish, but I wish it had a bit more of a kick to it . \u00a0Main course: Roast Pork Belly (\u00a316) - cooked perfectly, crackling skin, tender meat. \u00a0Carrot + Red Onion Coleslaw (\u00a33.50) - thought it was delicious! Though a bit heavy on the onion. \u00a0Still very good. Mac 'n Cheese (\u00a34.50) - nice n creamy, slightly on the salty side! \u00a0It was OK, I don't think I'd order this again. \u00a0I do prefer the one at Barbecoa (J.O's restaurant across the way). 10oz Beef Sirloin (\u00a328) - cooked perfectly, my friend ordered it medium, though I thought it was more on the medium rare side (the way I like it)! \u00a0Loved the fact that it came with a small bulb of roasted garlic and sauce on the side. \u00a0I wish I ordered this for myself instead of the pork belly!After sharing a bottle of wine, it came to around \u00a365 each. \u00a0Bit pricey, but the food was good. \u00a0Overall, there weren't any jaw-dropping menu items; but the food is tasty, the atmosphere was nice, and the staff was very attentive. \u00a0Sure I'd come back if someone wanted to go here, but there are a slew of other great restaurants that I d like to try out before coming back to this one.A big fat bonus - I made reservations on toptable, and seems most (if not all) of their time slots give 1,000 points. \u00a0That's halfway there to a \u00a320 food voucher :)",

A slice of Monterey Jack cheese is melted atop it and piled with pickles and a smoked tomato ketchup. On the bottom is a mayo lettuce slaw of sorts that gives the burger a creamy and savory texture. A soft bun that holds it all together is very neutral and allows the beef's saltiness and the ketchup's vinegar and salt to contrast with the creamy slaw. Gordon took a risk contrasting these flavors and it works quite effortlessly with top quality ingredients.",

We are trying to live a healthy life, so why so much salt?The steak was a little bit expensive too but the rest of the menu is cheap.",

I ordered the king crab California rolls as my starter, then the pork belly for my main. I absolutely loved the rolls. Not only was there a healthy amount of delicious crab on each of the six pieces of rolls but the also, the soya sauce dip added a perfect sesame-scented touch to the overall delight of this dish. As for the pork belly, it was solid though felt a bit too much/heavy at times. Perhaps, it would have been better if they served slightly less and instead offered more sides to go with the plate (as of now, you have to order all the sides separately). Service was good, though it did take them longer than what I would have expected for a party of ten people. Ambience was also solid -- somewhat reminiscent of Hawksmoor but a brighter version of it.Overall, a great place to try out!",

    "text": "Well, well, well... Mr. Ramsay, when was the last time you did a quality check here? So let's start from the beginning: what an odd front entrance! Huge curtains leading to a lonely bartender who directed me to take the stairs while directing a couple behind me to take the lift... I guess I should take that as a compliment! Upstairs I was greeted by a nice woman but unfortunately she had bad breath. Interestingly enough so did the waiter! Shortly after being shown my table I was provided with a couple of tiny although really good pieces of bread. Little did I know at this point that I'd be charged two frickin pounds per piece!!! At no point was this detail disclosed to me and it was only when the bill arrived that I noticed this rip off! I ordered the burger and the chips. I asked the burger to be prepared medium... Got it completely without a trace of pink plus it was dry and tasted ok at best. The chips were an even bigger disappointment, where they were uncertain whether they were fried (lots of grease on the outside) or baked (somewhat undercooked on the inside). The dessert was definitely better, with a pecan pie, cinnamon ice cream and an espresso. Service was sub par with the waiter disappearing at times. I couldn't help but notice that the two tables next to mine weren't impressed by the service either. From start to end it took roughly an hour and a half but I truly believe I could have been out of there in an hour should the waiter be a little more attentive and proactive. To end, I don't like the way the bill shows the total including the discretionary tip. Wouldn't it be more customer friendly to have the total first (without the tip?) and then another total showing the amount with the tip?...Anyway, Plane Food at Heathrow airport was great. This place? Somewhat of a letdown for me. It gets three stars because dessert was great, location and facility are amazing and the washroom is really cool! (how embarrassing that's one of the reasons but it's true!).",

    "text": "This week, I had the impromptu pleasure of dining at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.We're already onto a winner before I've even stepped inside because I am likely to support anything that angry and brilliant Scottish man does.I sat down for lunch at his very own, 'Bread Street Kitchen', situated in the heart of the City of London. (Might I add, right next to Jamie Oliver's restaurant, Barbecoa) What actually struck me the most was just the sheer size of the first floor, it is really quite vacuous, but with a rustic/art-deco-esque feel.To make sense of it, I guess you could think of it as, where Italian cuisine meets corporate London and the result is quite a unique restaurant of modern, clean-cut decor, strewn with well-placed homely-touchesI began my visit with a Cosmopolitan - whilst some may see this as too much on a Monday lunchtime, I can at least position myself as a cosmo-connoisseur as an excuse.I have to say, it was one of the best cosmos I have ever had - I just wish there was more of it! Made with Tanqueray Gin and Pierre Ferrand dry Cura\u00e7ao with Blossoms raspberry syrup and fresh lemon juice; it was fruity, floral and perfectly balanced.I decided to start with a comforting bowl of Rigatoni. I can never resist this type of over sized pasta tubes, especially when it comes with aubergine (my favourite vegetable), and cheese (mozzarella and Pecorino Romano) Double cheese? Sold!The generous-size-for-a-starter was by no means beautiful, but it was beautifully simple, perfectly al dente and comforting. Remaining with the comfort food, I then tried the spiced braised lamb shank with mash potato, baby onions and orange gremolata. The meat was as tender-soft as I'd hoped (with maybe a little too much skin and fat for me) and the mash potato were buttery clouds. I enjoyed it very much, however I would say the rest of the dish actually wasn't packed with flavour, including the jus-y sauce surrounding the dish.The staff were pleasant, especially the chefs behind the counter. I would however say the waiting staff were relatively vacant; forgetting to take our drink order at the start or mis-remembering details - perhaps this is usual, perhaps they were just having a day-dreamy afternoon - either way I can just imagine Mr. Ramsay taking a characteristic melt-down at certain points of the service.I was thrilled to dine as this pleasant, bright and vibrant establishment and I would be happy to return for the comforting home food and excellent cocktails.Read the review: laurajreeves.com/2014/03\u2026See more at: blissormiss.tumblr.com",

Here is a factual description of what happened when I \"dined\" here: We arrived at 8:45 pm and left at 11 pm. At some point during the course of three hours, I consumed food. (I put \"dined\" in quotes because what actually happened was kind of like waiting at the Home Office in Croyden for your visa to get renewed where you know you had an appointment time but you get there and everyone' s clearly been promised the same thing and all eagerly straining to hear their number called with unrealistic expectation.)After we had all tried for an hour to make eye contact with our secret agent of a waiter (he was very good at evading our attentions), we finally managed to flag him down and was promised that our food would be ready in \"2 minutes\", which actually ended up being another 15 minutes. Then I ate something. Like a sausage dish? i don't really remember what it was because by this time, I had been starving for several hours. I did burn my mouth though in my eagerness.",

    "text": "BSK has a trendy atmosphere with lively music, everything from Steve Miller and Aretha Franklin to The Roots and Daft Punk. It has kind of a renovated warehouse feel to it, which is cool.Naturally, we started by sampling one of Chef Gordon Ramsay's appetizers. We decided on the Flat bread, complete with caramelized onions, taleggio cheese, cured pig's cheeks, pine nuts, basil pesto. I was surprised my wife was adventurous enough for pig cheeks, but I was also really happy. The flat bread itself was nice and crispy. There were salty overtones from the pork, but the majority of the flavor was from the pesto. It was good, though I'd hoped for better from a restaurant of this caliber.For my entree, I picked out the 10-ounce Dingley Dell Pork Chop, topped with bearnaise (the other options were pepper or a marrowbone and shallot sauce). The charcoal grill options (of which this is one) come a la carte, so I also added a side of Buttered Jersey Royal Potatoes with Spring Onions. The potatoes were nice and buttery, with just the right amount of flavor from the onions. They were a tad salty for my liking though. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and the bearnaise was a great pairing. The fat ring was crisp and charred from the grill, and there was a nice charcoal flavor throughout. Cooking the chop bone-in made it extra juicy.For dessert, we decided to try the Blood Orange Baked Alaska. They were sadly out of blood orange sorbet, so they subbed in mango sorbet instead. It was really tasty! I'm sure the mango version packed more flavor than the blood orange would have anyway.We had eaten at Chef Ramsay's Maze Grill the night before, and in comparison Bread Street Kitchen was much snobbier all the way around (including the wait staff), which is weird since I think Maze Grill is the ritzier of the two. That being said, we both really enjoyed the meal.",

I don't really feel like I've been missing out on much though.Went for lunch with a friend, her bro and their parents who were visiting from Dubai (I suspect working so close meant she decided to invite me to their family lunch before I spotted them from my window and crashed it anyway!). The Gordon Ramsay tag understandably offered some kind of insurance that she was taking them somewhere nice. After being ushered upstairs to the restaurant I was frankly stunned by the size of the place, taking a few seconds to check I wasn't looking into a mirror and yup, the place really did go on that far. I really liked the upmarket NYC bistro style buzz, and the large floor to ceiling windows let in lots of light which was fortunate as we'd happened upon that rare treasure that is... a sunny day in London! *gasp*The bread basket was pretty to look at though quite crusty (prompting some good discussion of the latest Great British Bake Off ep!). Sadly my main course was a let-down, the roasted cod being a generously thick portion of tastelessness, though I'm assured other choices were better. Fortunately my friend's dad had chosen a great light white wine (making me thankful I had no meetings on that afternoon), and dessert swung things back into tasty territory - my chocolate fondant had that sighworthy melt-in-the-middle gooeyness it's supposed to, and my friend's passionfruit tart prompted lots of yum's (though judging by the crusts flying off the plate towards the end, the pastry around the edge was a little hard to break). Her bro went for the 'Milk and Two' drink which was basically whisky-flavoured boozy milk (hmm something to sedate future little ones with?! err, just kidding...) whilst her dad was the most daring and hit the jackpot with 'The Harlem Hard Shake' - bacardi, jagermeister, salted caramel, ice cream and other good stuff. Yeah pretty sure I wouldn't have made it back to work at all if I'd gone for that!As you can probably tell desserts were the high point, but have restrained myself to 3-stars as guess I expected more in terms of the food and flavours given the Gordon Ramsay name on the door and those sorts of prices (luckily I was being treated this time wooh). Might have to come back to try the downstairs bar if I can persuade someone to buy me a drink one eve - I did spy some quirky gym horses that gave me flashbacks to school PE lessons doubling as bar benches which looked kinda cool... Meanwhile if you do find yourself in the restaurant, mind your teeth on the bread, avoid the cod and defo leave room for dessert!",

    "text": "Really like this place.Ambiance:Great vibe. Extremely large, particularly for a restaurant in London. Fortunately the space is well utilised. High celings, good spacing between tables, and of course, the amount of space generally all result in a very bright, airy and cheerful environment. Reminds me a lot of ABC Kitchen in NY which is one of my favourite restaurants generally so that's a good thing.Food/Drinks:Quite a good cocktail selection, so that's always nice.Admittedly, I didn't take any gambles with the food; scallops and the pork belly got the most mentions on yelp so I had both and they did not disappoint. Scallops were absolutely divine. Perfectly cooked, really nice sear, and creamy in the middle. Could easily have eaten way more of these.Pork belly likewise was perfectly cooked, and melt-in-your-mouth good. The spiced apple sauce was the perfect complement. My one complaint was that the crackling was insanely salty. Ultimately all this meant is that I had really small bites of it and left a lot at the end, but it was a bit ridiculous and hence the star off the rating.Was too full for dessert sadly but the panna cotta and chocolate fondant were both calling out to me. My friend had the cod, and he said it was a great dish as well.Service:Multiple reviews mention slow service. I would have to agree. The wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable, albeit slightly inattentive. They took ages to come for the order, clear the food etc... That being said, it was still borderline acceptable.Overall, food is nothing too complex, but everything is really well executed. Awesome ambiance and a decent drink selection make this a must repeat for me. I imagine this would be the perfect brunch spot, so that's definitely going to be my next trip.",

They were not very busy so it was disappointing that it took 45 minutes for the food to make it to the table.I cannot even remember how many times the servers did something a bit strange but it happened too frequently for sure. We were still eating our bread and without asking if they could clear our plates, they grabbed all the plates on the table and took off with them. Really bizarre experience.Spicy Scramble Scrambled eggs, chorizo, tomato, caramelised onion, Monterey Jack cheese Open King Crab Omelette Open-faced omelette of king crab, Wye Valley asparagus, shaved Pecorino cheese",

The ambience was nice and the restaurant was on the 2nd floor. We arrived at 7pm and the place was half deserted. Hunmmmm..maybe it's summer, it's hot and people decided to head outdoor for drinks instead? Anyway, we were seated and began pouring over the menu. The waitress was fab and made good recommendations - she told us what's the most popular, dishes that always stay on the menu and personal favourite - you could tell that she was really passionate about her job. \u00a0The salmon tartar was good (it's my first time trying it so can't really compare to anywhere else). Main was steamed sea bream with butter. Surprisingly, it tastes really fresh, light and clean, none of those fishy bad smell. We also tried their cocktail, they don't scrimp on their alcohol so it was great! I like their food, the waitress who served us and the ambience. Well, i should have rated it a lot higher right? Yep, I was really torn, for the reasons below: 1. Mandatory \u00a32 cover charge per person - no idea why 2. Service charge was included although optional - note how I've said that the waitress that served us was good? However the let down was the amount of time we needed to get their attention, way too long! Other than that, I would recommend going to Gordon Ramsey restaurant to try it out, it's worth a try at least! :)",

I can definitely recommend this for groups! large enough tables, enough space so that you are neither crammed next to each other or have to worry that the table next to you hears every word you say. The cocktails and starters we had were great, they staff took very good care of us and of our guests with dietary requirements (vegans/vegetarians). 5 stars because while you can have \"fancier\" food in a few places in London, this has something for everyone and for a group of 10 people it was just perfect!",

The burger is served in a brioche-style bun with an eggy, glossy finish that holds the perfectly-sized burger patty. \u00a0The cheese is melty and engulfs the patty and Bread Street has shown some restraint with the sauce so that it doesn't ooze all over you. \u00a0It appears they cut the lettuce down to size in a bid to make everything concentrically circular. \u00a0Call me OCD for liking that, but to me, the only thing worse than a lousy bit of beef is an under-sized patty that is swallowed up by the bun and toppings.Hand-cut chips or mash will be another \u00a34 if you fancy a side - or Ramsay's mac 'n' cheese with garlic-roasted crumbs will be \u00a35.50. \u00a0It's on the pricey side for such a simple burger, but it's done well and satisfies the meat-lover in me. \u00a0It doesn't try to bowl you over with elaborate fixings, rich delicate toppings or the like - it simply does the job.My final take on the burger: it's quite nice, but just that - it doesn't wow or stand out in a crowded London field. \u00a0It almost seems that it's on the menu because it has to be... It's good, not great. \u00a0According to Forbes, Ramsay's empire netted him $60 million in earnings in 2015 - not bad for a guy who started out playing football in Scotland. \u00a0Ramsay's culinary career started in the kitchen of Macro Pierre White before advancing through that of Albert Roux, Guy Savoy, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, and Pierre Koffman. \u00a0Not a bad roster if you want to learn a thing or two about cooking.You can read my full review here: beeffanatic.com/2016/02/\u2026",

If you are going for a quiet dinner, this is not your place.Got seated with my friend near the window which was kind of nice. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. I've been to a couple Gordon Ramsay restaurants in the US, so obviously I wanted to check this one out. Our server messed up my drink order, but it wasn't anything to complain about- he probably didn't hear me since it was so loud. Our drinks arrived after five minutes, our food after ten, so incredibly fast. My caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had. It's hard to ruin a basic salad or to make it stand out, but for whatever reason, it did. I got the side of macaroni and cheese as well, and it was good! Not the best or worst I've ever had, but I ate it all ;) It made me laugh how fast our food came out considering how busy the place was. The service was pretty good, but when it came time to pay, our guy disappeared. This happens no matter where I go. If you aren't in a rush, I would still stop by. It is decorated very well, and I love places that pay attention to detail. I would return, the menu had great options!",

    "text": "Went there on a weekday night in April, albeit somewhat early for dinner, and reservations definitely weren't necessary. It started to fill up later. If you prefer a later meal, though, you might want to call it in, just in case. Our expectations for the bread were somewhat raised for a place called Bread Street Kitchen. The \"complimentary\" (except not so complimentary) bread was quite good, with a nice hard crust and soft crumb, although you could tell it wasn't totally freshly made. The butter was fresh and thick, yet easy to spread. Delicious scallop appetizer (baked scallops with carrot puree, treacle bacon, celery cress) - One of the best dishes of the night. The scallops were huge (maybe 5 cm/2in in diameter) and well cooked so they were lightly crisp on the edges yet soft, juicy, and delicate on the inside.Barbecue sampler (beef rump, gammon, lamb chop, pork sausage, veal kidney) with pepper sauce - Presentation was a bit plain, but everything was juicy, well-seasoned, and cooked to an appropriate temperature.We also had the crispy duck salad, which was fresh, but nothing worth writing home about. The duck was a bit dry for me.I have to compliment BSK's varied drink menu, including creative and classic cocktails, international craft beers, and over a dozen pages of wine. As a big beer fan, I especially enjoyed the Innis & Gunn (apparently one of Gordon's favorites!), Beavertown 8 Ball Rye IPA, and the Rocky Head Pale Ale (two of the hoppiest beers I've had in two days of pub-hopping in London).Good experience, a bit overpriced (especially considering the USD to GBP exchange rate), great service, and solid, if forgettable food.",

Usually a buggy = a look of Holy shit where are we going to fit that thing?!Had a lovely rose that I'll have to try again but the portion of meat to accoutrements was absurd. I had ordered the Red wine braised feather blade, star anise carrot puree, creamed wild mushrooms. If you're wondering what feather blade is as i did, its beef. And it was succulent and fall off the bone (if there was a bone) soft. It was delicious. But just a smear of puree and a bit of mushroom is not going to take me as far as the meat. I had to order a side of mashed potato which was nice, but bland and super starchy. Felt like i had eaten some peanut butter and now was getting stuck to the roof of my mouth. Starchy bland gak on the roof of my mouth. Not the greatest. note to self: Always order a side.",

We had to wait a little longer than their norm (which we were willing to do because it was busy). We were given a complimentary appetizer, and the meal was served 15 minutes later. Apparently there was some turmoil in the kitchen, so the dessert we wanted would take a bit longer to prepare (again, we were okay with waiting). Sure enough, a complimentary dessert was brought our way. We didn't mention it to our server or anyone, but we happen to be visiting London on our honeymoon. We will definitely be making a return visit every time we come here, as our stay was definitely enhanced by Bread Street!",

Talk about competition!. \u00a0The seating areas and main kitchen areas are very open planned and there are amazing 'green illuminated' fridges above the kitchen to store wines and champagnes, the exposed air conditioning system blends seamlessly into the ceiling and you hardly know it's there, very nice!. \u00a0The staff and waiters are very welcoming and know what's on the menu (including any specials). \u00a0I had a 12oz Rib Eye Steak with Peppercorn Sauce and Chips which were out of this world served in a little silver bucket, plus Dessert which was also very nice. \u00a0 So all I can say to sum up this Restaurant is that if your a fan of Gordon Ramsay and are ever in London (Heddon Street - off Regent Street) and Bread Street Kitchen (Near St. Pauls) then treat yourself to an amazing meal and Dessert they won't let you down!",

The restaurant to me looks like an old train station, each section has old style lamps and curtains, which I'm guessing during dinner they close to make it all a little more private. The menu is VERY basic. I struggled to find something that really sung out to me, and made me want to eat it. Which isn't what you want. I ended up with 2 poached eggs and toast. Avocado and Mushrooms, were extra, and a pricey \u00a33 or more each. The coffee as usual was in a small mug, and I would normally order another when the food comes, but the staff did a drop and run, and never came back. I guess i can't complain for \u00a315 a head for breakfast, BUT there are much better places to spend \u00a315 for breakfast.",

    "text": "A group of friends and I took an overseas trip and one of our stops was London. I was so excited to learn that there was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant near where we were staying, so we HAD to come try it out, specifically for the famous beef wellington. Man... what an incredibly disappointing experience this was for us..Downstairs is a pizza place, so make sure you go to the second floor for the actual restaurant. It was a gorgeous looking place. We ordered the beef wellington, a dry aged tomahawk steak, a couple sides, and some drinks. The wellington takes 45 minutes to make, just a quick tip, so definitely order that first. Our main server definitely wasn't the friendliest and didn't come back to retake our drink orders or anything. We had to flag down a couple other people to re-order. The food took almost an hour and a half to come out, and by the time we got it, it was cold. The steaks were so hard to cut through and tough to chew. If they were hot when they came out, we would've enjoyed it a lot more. The wellington itself was okay, I expected a lot more from it. Presentation of both was awesome though, but the quality of the meats did not reflect the price we paid for either. There are plenty of steakhouses back home in NYC that beat the quality of the steak here.For 4 of us, the total came out to almost $400 with a few drinks added. I don't think it was worth that price at all. I gave it a two star rating because a couple of the staff members were really friendly and made the experience a bit better. But other than that and being able to say I've eaten at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, nothing really stood out or was memorable.",

Bread Kitchen did not disappoint! I had the DELICIOUS superfood salad (packed with so many fresh, tasty vegetables) and the chocolate cake (perfectly oozing and not too sweet). Everything seemed prepared at a very high technical skill level and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I would say was missing was that \"comfort\" food feeling. This doesn't meant comfort food, I mean food that makes you feel happy and not just satisfied (this can come in a salad form too!). Again, technically everything was done to perfection. There was just that \"extra\" component missing to take it over the top. I applaud the restaurant but am not rushing to return. The ambiance is super cute. It has an after-work chill, yet slightly upscale, vibe. They even have a photo booth where you can snap photos and get a free photo strip! Love this. The service was impeccable. Well run establishment with very good food!",

Our cocktails were actually excellent, so we thought that was a good sign. We ordered the celeriac soup and the tuna tartare to start with. The soup was good. The tartare was slathered in a salty sauce that completely masked the tuna flavor rather than enhancing it. Nonetheless, it was edible. I ordered a dry aged ribeye - which happened to be the only dry aged thing they actually had despite the menu's suggestion that they maintain all kinds of different aged cuts. My husband ordered the lamb. Both of us were asked \"pink or not pink?\" Umm, is the rare to well done scale not a thing in the UK? Well, we both said pink and hoped for the best.Lamb arrived completely overcooked. Damn shame and waste. My steak was thin and looked like the horrible freezer steaks of my childhood. It, thankfully, was pink. However, it was INEDIBLE. The salt content made it absolutely impossible to eat. Awful meal.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying out BSK as I'm a big fan of Ramsay and have enjoyed cooking many of the BSK dishes at home. The setting is very well done, well suited for more relaxed corporate lunches or dinners. I ordered the pork belly with spiced carrots and truffle mash. The dishes were well seasoned and tasted great though I was a bit disappointed with the pork - the skin wasn't as crispy as it could've been and the consistency of the meat was quite loose. Perhaps I'm just too picky! Though having cooked at home Kitchen by Mike's most excellent pork belly recipe (see 2nd pic), which includes 'pressing' overnight, I feel BSK could've done a better job. But who am I to give Ramsay tips! The staff were very attentive and I would go back again albeit to try a different dish.",

The tuna tartare appetizer was decent, and the drinks were good. Overall, pretty good value for your money.",

Our table was very shaky which I asked for the server to put a wedge under with he did. Our server took a few minutes to get to us but lucky we were seated with the menus. \u00a0I already had an idea what i was going to have based off the menu i found online. \u00a0It then turns out that they were out of basically \u00a0everything i wanted from the starters Roasted Veal Carpaccio, Potted Salt Brisket & Baked Scallops. We ended up getting the Tamarind Spiced Chicken Wings & Flat Bread with Caramelised Onions. We told the server to place our starters while we figure out our mains. then the server tells me they are out of Roasted Sea Trout, \u00a0Spiced braised lamp shank, \u00a0Steamed sea beam. My brother wanted the lamb shank but couldn't get it instead got the rib eye. I ordered the pork belly, few minutes after the server left he came back to tell me they were out of the pork belly. the server took all menus off the table without asking if we wanted wine or any cocktails. So already not to a good start after everything we wanted was 86'd . \u00a0While waiting for the mains the table was unstable again which i looked for the server but he never came to check on the table so i had to get on my knees and fix the table myself. The food then came out by the manger and the assistant manager. I guess our server was to busy to be bothered. \u00a0The food was really good! We got 2 rib eyes med and med-well, lamb chops med and the pork chop. Then we shared order of mash, veg & mac & cheese. Overall the food was really great =, starters was a bit small but good. It was just service that sucked. We told the manager that we were very disappointed in the services as the only time the server came to the table to was take the order at the beginning. He told us he would look into this problem and waive the service charge. I work in the service industry and i know good service. The restaurant lost out and on over 100 pounds in drinks we were never asked if we wanted anything to drink as the server never came back to the table. We were going to get a bottle of wine and other cocktails.  All in all food is really good but really needs to work on service. Simple things like service would ruin a good thing. That is the mean reason would rate this a 3. Also by looking at the reviews below it looks like everyone agrees the service need's a lot of work. Instead of GR teaching other restaurateurs \u00a0about service he should review Bread Street. \u00a0 Food was very good but lacked quality of service based on the price you pay. Oh yeah there is a 2pound per person service fee which i really don't understand.",

The menu is diverse and vegetarian friendly and the wine list is superb, with good bottles starting at \u00a330. The interior design has an early 1900s industrial feel which fits the surrounding buildings and is trendy but not pretentious.",

Te fries were gone in no time at all. \u00a0not the cheapest place in the area but sometime you get what you pay for",

To take the conclusion first: It was a great experience!You enter via the bar and step up to the restaurant \u00a0it's huge, it's industrial, it's modern, it's vibrant. Very friendly staff \u00a0and hundreds of them!The menu is fantastic \u00a0including the wood stone where they finish various dishes. It's the kind of food, which you would expect from Gordon in such a location \u00a0here are some examples, we had:Carpaccio of Octopus: a little nothing with absolute fantastic tasteSteamed bass: perfect, what a tasteGrilled halibut: amazing, grilled to perfectionSuckling pig (in the wood oven): a real experienceOur favorite: the braised pork collar \u00a0this is unbelievable goodAnd last but not least: the hand-cut chips. For me these are the worldwide standard, how chips should be made \u00a0the best I ever had.All in all, for the 4 of us it was 180,- including drinks (some beers, no wine). Worth every penny, because you don't just eat there \u00a0you look around and you can't get enough of the flair of this location with the open kitchen.This restaurant and Jamie's Barbecoa (which sit's aside this one) are for me the future of exciting dining! Great job \u00a0could't imaging it better.One small criticism (I now it's the first week): Too many waiters. The main waitress was great, she was able to answer all questions on the food in detail. The other guys just brought drinks etc., but didn't have a clue about the menu.",

    "text": "After eating here last night and quite enjoying my night, i visited yelp to see how others enjoyed their meal, and was quite shocked by the reviews.The restaurant is a very classy but casual decor, with dark woods and mustard colored leather booths lining the grand 'cafeteria' layout of this fashionably retro restaurant. My girlfriend and i were seated at a rather awkward table, and after seeing me unconfortably try to squeeze into a seat next to my girlfriend, the hostess asked if we'd like a better table, subsequently being seated comfortably in a booth, looking upon the cooks madily dishing out gourmet food. We were promptly given bread and butter (notably delicious) and menus. Being a college student, the menu prices were quite expensive, but happy that i was in such an aromatic smelling restaurant, i decided to splurge. I got the chicken wings as a starter ( wonderful flavor, perfect amount of crunch) the cheeseburger (cheapest item on the menu, but was thick, unique, and delectable), chips ( which were wedge cut and crispy, but i had to ask for salt and ketchup as they were fairly bland) and the pineapple desert with passion fruit seeds and coconut sorbet (delicious combination of flavours). My girlfriend who is a vegetarian got the eggplant penne which i took a bite of and was happy with the amount of flavor. Overall, i had a very enjoyable night here. The service was good, (likely improved since our last reviewers) and the food was excellent. The only reason this place did not recieve 5 stars is due to the price of some of the main dishes (45 pounds for a steak?) and because i really couldnt understand a word my waitress said (speech impediment?). I would come back here when someone else is paying!",

    "text": "My wife and I are on vacation and after a long day at the Tower of London and she made reservations for dinner at 7 pm on Sunday. \u00a0We arrived and the place looked closed. \u00a0No it wasn't, just not that many people in there. It should have been a sign. We started with the potted brisket appetizer. Not bad and the pickled vegetables on the side were nice. For the entrees we tried to order the pork belly only to be told that they were out. How do you run out out of that dish at 7 pm? \u00a0So my wife ordered the cod with caramelized onions. After the pork belly disappointment I asked the waiter about the rib filet. He said you can get it medium rare or well done. Great, either perfect or like shoe leather. I ordered medium rare. It arrived and was, well like shoe leather. And it was only two slices that we about as thick as a piece of cardboard. For the cost it was a crazy small portion. On to the tastes...the cod was very good (and a decent size portion unlike the rib fillet) on a bed of potatoes \u00a0The rib beef gravy was quite nice as it was made with bone marrow and shallots. Again the beef was tough and wayyyy overcooked. Ok, so we are not blown away but liked the dinner, then we got our check. \u00a0On it was a optional 1\u00a3 charge for a food bank and a 2\u00a3 per person cover charge. Wait, what? \u00a0A cover charge for a Sunday night when there was maybe 25 people there. Simply crazy. I could understand a cover on busy nights but Sunday?Gordon, get here quick and fix this mess.",

    "text": "I was first on opening day for Breakfast and almost the last to leave when I returned for dinner so definitely had more of a feel for the overall Bread Street Kitchen experience than most,With over 700 people booked for the first day I am glad I had the early day experience which would give a better idea how service would run under normal circumstances then what some other reviews have been based on during 'Rush Hour' Evening with over 200 Customers eating at any one timeincluding the usual first day river of papa'rat'zi reviewers and self-proclaimed 'expert' bloggers trying to make a name for themselves by trying to find criticism in every twisted perverse way they can whilst actually forgetting the food, Ambiance, Decor or the mostly good elements of service!Ok Breakfast first which someone has done an amazing Job sourcing as is literally the best of everything-For those who have had the fortune of indulging in breakfast at Planefood at T5 you will know what I'm talking about \u00a0It's the reason why since T5 has opened I have never taken a flight from any other terminal even if the cost of the flight was hundreds more! Service at breakfast was pretty much flawless considering 1st day a pretty mean feat with the place gradually filling.Onto dinner and an amazing great Value menu, The dearest item for main is a Massive Rib eye steak at \u00a329 on par with my favourite steak haunts Hawksmoor and Goodman the difference was around \u00a310 behind the above mentioned on price and taste ahead of a certain 'cooks' restaurant opposite. Who is meant to pride himself on the ability to source and cook a steak correctly!That was the most expensive item most were around the \u00a315 mark my fianc\u00e9e had the Sea Bass at \u00a318 and my friend Gordon's amazing Short Rib burger one of the best I have sampled and at \u00a311 making his starter and main less than \u00a320!! Most of the starters are around \u00a310, As you would expect from Ramsay establishment this gets you amazing fresh produce combined into a taste tantalising combination which excites and intrigues the palette. Carpaccio of octopus capers and black olives with saffron , Stone Bass, Avocado, horseradish and ginger, my choice was thinly sliced Lancashire beef, Barigoule vegetables, and quail's eggs \u00a0all I can say is organic orgasmic !So to sum up Dinner at an average of around \u00a330 for 2 courses you would be hard pushed to find such value in the surrounding area and the quality and taste combination's just blow its competitors somewhere into the Thames! Wines and Champagnes they have a well-chosen and great value list , Bollinger Rose for eighty something pounds makes any celebration affordable.Then there is the restaurant itself \u00a35m to launch it's for a reason, It simply is one of the most stunning sensational design in the city everything is reclaimed and extremely fun and funky I loved it. There are some great view points if you want to check out what's going on and seating that a lot of thought went into so that big groups are cosy 2's can be comfortable.. To Sum up A fantastic team and the best freshest produce make Bread Street Kitchen a fantastic experience, Amazing Value and undoubtedly one of Gordon's biggest Successes.",

    "text": "Took my family here for dinner on a trip to London in June based on a recommendation from a business associate. \u00a0This was going to be our one \"high-end\" meal during our visit so we were really looking forward to the dining experience. \u00a0We had an early reservation and the place was pretty empty - of course that did not stop them from seating up right on top of another couple. \u00a0First off the wait staff seemed very green -- and rather awkward - it was just off. \u00a0 We ordered drinks and my son hesitated a moment trying to decide what and if he wanted - the waiter totally missed this and just walked off without taking his order. I had ordered a premium liquor martini - it had to be the smalled martini I have ever seen! \u00a0To add insult to injury it was so watered down that it virtually had no flavor. \u00a0Even after drinking a second I felt as if I had just had two glasses of water. Usually after two martinis I am having trouble sitting up!Our appetizers arrived - forget what they were - but they were fine. \u00a0My daughter and I had ordered a salad in addition to our entree. \u00a0When our entrees arrived I mentioned that we had ordered salads and before I could say we no longer wanted them since our meal was there - the waiter said they were coming! \u00a0A minute later he plopped a salad down in front of us. \u00a0We were then faced with letting our hot meal get cold while we ate our salad or just tackle both of them. \u00a0This is what I mean about the service - it was just very inexperienced and not up to par with the image this restaurant is trying to project - and certainly not the prices that they are charging.Bottom line: \u00a0good to very good food - very small portions - very high prices. \u00a0Wait staff appears to have been on the job for about 2 days -- I could forgive it if it was just one of the staff --but for some reason we had about 3 or 4 staff at one time or another -- and they all seemed somewhat lost and stumbling over themselves. \u00a0I think maybe Gordon needs to start having one of his tantrums when he is there next.My advice - save your money \u00a0and go elsewhere - there are much better restaurants in London for the price. \u00a0It is a beautiful place though!",

What??Went downhill from that. Food took forever, and it wasn't even busy. We wanted to have the service taken off the bill, bit figured we may have to wait another hour if we did ask.

    "text": "I'm genuinely surprised by the positive reviews. I went for breakfast on a Sunday and found a good few gripes with the place.First of all I must say how stunning Bread St Kitchen is: whoever the interior designer was did a fantastic job - it's just like sitting in 60's New York. No complaints there.However, the service really let it down for me. The food is not out-of-this-world-amazing, which is unfortunate as that would have been the only thing to distract from the distinctly strange waiters. When we were first seated, the staff actually avoided coming over to us to take even the drinks orders - this on a very very quiet early Sunday morning, when there were perhaps only 2 more couples in the restaurant. I dread to think what it's like on a weekend night.When we were finally noticed and given the menus, we were told to hurry up with the order, and our waiter stood right by our table whilst we attempted to read and decide and communicate our order within 60 seconds.The (overpriced) food came swiftly but inexpicably still managed to be cold. This is when the service became even stranger - having ignored us for large stretches of time, they then wouldn't leave us alone to eat. We were asked 3 times how our food was within about 2 minutes, and without any of them bringing the sauces that we had asked for when the food arrived! Very frustrating.They also stood by our table with the credit card machine when they brought the bill, which was not only disconcerting but also very rude.On a brighter note, I must admit that the spinach was absolutely fantastic.However, I'm afraid that I don't have the patience or cash to go to this place again, no matter how lovely the interior is. It's genuinely terrible.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ faultless cooking+ hospitable service+ fun d\u00e9cor in NY deli-style- small portions- dull (to the point of awful) presentation- not value for money A friend and I came to Bread Street Kitchen for lunch on a Monday. We have pre-booked a table for 12:30pm and were promptly led upstairs to our wobbly table. Before I had a chance to say something about it, the ma\u00eetre d noticed and had this fixed by one of the waitresses. Soon after we ordered our drinks (but before our food), a couple of mini bread loaves arrived in a cylindrical basket with soft, melty butter. Good start so far. Our food came quickly but I was disappointed by the portion size and the presentation. I had the tuna with parsnip mash and peppercorn sauce (\u00a319), which came with crispy slices of parsnip as decoration but I found the whole dish really brown and didn't look particularly appetising. My friend ordered the burger (\u00a312) which arrived on its own with no flair and looked not too dissimilar to what one could get at GBK or Byron's but without the trimmings, although my friend did say it tasted nice. Presentation aside, the yellow fin tuna I had was fresh and delicious, beautifully seared on both sides although the slices were rather thin. The parsnip mash was smooth and creamy, and peppercorn sauce acceptable (although I am lucky that my other half can make a sauce that taste just as good). For the price of \u00a350 for two at lunch (for two mains, a side, a glass of house white and an orange juice, including 12.5% 'discretionary' tip added to the bill), I thought it was expensive given the presentation and portion size. There are certainly many restaurants in and around London where you can get same quality of food but either better presentation or bigger size (or both) for that money. Overall, it is a banker's dig due to its proximity to the City of London (financial district) and therefore the high price might not be a deterrent for most. The restaurant offers good quality cooking (and some nice-looking cocktails, especially the dessert cocktails) but there are better haunts in London for good food at that price.",
