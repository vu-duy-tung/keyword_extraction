    "text": "My first visit to Koya (the restaurant) was admittedly underwhelming. I guess I didn't know what I was really expecting from the place. But I've been back several times since and I've been cautious about writing a review because I find myself liking it more and more everytime. Until now, I think I actually crave a bit of Koya every now and then. The udon is great, but that on its own would never have earned a 5-star rating, there's so much more to Koya. Let's start with udon - hand made, the udon at Koya has a great texture, I always get the udon cold because I like the tenacity and would prefer that they were kept that way until I decide to eat it. The broths and choices are simple and straight forward. I didn't quite get the flavours at first, but the more I eat here, the more I appreciate the simplicity. The walnut paste and mushrooms is definitely one of my favourite here, but everything's good. What tips Koya off the scale and into 5 star territory is / are its specials. They change with frequency and it always brings something new to the table. They marry ingredients I would never have dreamt of, and honestly opens my taste palette to new experiences. How could I not give them 5 stars. The last special I had was the John Dory sashimi with soy marinated cucumbers and something really fragrant on the plate. The flavours were gentle and worked in harmony. It delighted and suprised me. As for it's pork belly - I always get this - it's just divine.",

There's often a queue in the evening, but not as long as Koya's.Tip: If you get the cold udon and hot brother, you start eating it relatively quickly. I lingered with my starter for too long, and then I had cold udon and warmish broth, which got cold pretty quickly when I added the noodles.I also really like their tempura, though an entire portion plus udon is a little much, so try to get someone to share. My favourites are the spring onion and tofu cold udon, for a hot summer day, the mushroom and walnut miso udon, and the ten curry don. \u00a32 is excessive for an extra poached egg... but I get it anyway.I haven't been to Koya yet, so can't compare.",

    "text": "The little sibling of the larger Koya restaurant next door, Koya Bar is styled after the traditional Ramen houses where customers sit along a bar facing the kitchen. The menu here is more limited than its neighbour but the dishes are freshly made in front of you which provides a great opportunity to watch the chefs at work and see each step as your dish is assembled. The atmosphere is Spartan and the layout is challenging to socialise in groups, so Koya Bar is best suited for a quick catch up with a friend or a bowl of noodles before heading out in the area. Prices are reasonable with main dishes around the \u00a310 mark.The Kedgeree was fairly authentic and may be a good entry dish if you find yourself a bit dubious about the whole thing. The rice porridge is grainer than your standard cooked oats and the smoked haddock gives the dish a light savoury flavour. It's a step above congee (although I've had some full-bodied congee in my time) and is filling and warming - great if you are feeling the chill or are a bit under the weather.My curry udon noodles were fine but lacking the hefty punch I associate with curry. This is undoubtedly a result of my tendency to eat my mom's spicy chicken curries for breakfast whenever I'm at my parents' house so I imagine it's more than sufficient for the average person - particularly for breakfast!Rob H, Katie B's partner in crime, raves about the English Breakfast udon which is your standard udon noodle soup topped with a fried egg, bacon, and shiitake mushrooms. While it did look pretty good (and who doesn't love the smell of sizzling bacon), it's a hybrid dish I still can't quite get on board with. That being said, he's a noodle aficionado so there must be something to it.For a tenner, you do get a decent serving of food and service is fast and efficient if not the most friendly. I'm more than happy to drop in to line the stomach but if I had more time to kill (or was with more than one person) I think Bone Daddies has them beat.",

The udon is as great as it was next door, and the bar layout usually means shorter waiting times, although it is better suited for two or three than for a larger group (there are no tables, everyone sits around the bar). Order a starter from their specials menu - they make fantastic little plates, such as pickled cucumber or various salads etc. Really great stuff..",

Usually I find that when a traditional style place tries to do something a bit outside the main cuisine or get fusion-y it doesn't go well, but as a testament to the chef's mastery even the lettuce wrap special we tried was fantastic and fit right in with the rest of the menu. It took me right back to the year I spent in Tokyo. If you're a tourist like I was in London, you might not think to hit up a Japanese noodle bar during your trip, but I promise you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Thanks to Katie B for organising UYE breakfast edition here! \u00a0I've never had Japanese breakfast before, so I was keen on trying it out. I went with the Kedgeree (\u00a310), which is a rice porridge with smoked haddock, poached egg, and curry. \u00a0I enjoyed the dish, the smoked haddock was lovely, and it even came with a little dish of toasted anchovy flakes (could be something else, but its extremely fragrant and not fishy!) to sprinkle on top. \u00a0I could eat the powder on its own! I felt the Kedgeree was the most interesting main dish, as the other ones were pretty standard with eggs and bacon, with the occasional shiitake thrown in there. \u00a0Overall, it was a good and light (ie: non greasy) breakfast to start the day.While it was delicious, I thought the price was a bit steep (\u00a315 including service and tea), but quality Japanese food will be on the pricier side in this city. \u00a0 On the upside, the staff were really nice, and it was incredibly clean (a big plus in my books!)However - I AM keen on coming back to Koya bar to try their non breakfast items!",

Seating is cramped as it is a bar, but this makes for an amazing atmosphere. The chefs operate behind the bar, so you get to watch their traditional udon-making process, which is a treat. The noodles are amazing and served in 4 different ways- cold with dipping sauce, cold with pouring sauce, hot in hot broth, and cold in hot broth. They're all good options, but I find the last one needs some explanation: it is a plate of cold udon noodles that you add on your own to the hot broth. The broths and sauces are yummy- I recommend the smoked mackerel. This is not your pho soup or Chinese noodle shop. Udon is different and will taste much better if you go in without these expectations. Give it a try for the experience, or become a regular because of your noodle obsession. Either way, Koya is worth a visit.",

Huh, what's this place, I thought to myself.Koya Bar!! My favourite place to sit in Koya is at the kichen counter to watch the chefs at work. Now, they've created a restaurant where there is only kitchen counter seatingThe menu is virtually identical to Koya next door. I had my usual atsu atsu (hot udon noodles with hot broth) with tempura prawn. I also had one of their specials on the board - squid, watercress with sansho miso - nicely sauteed squid with slightly peppery watercress and sweet glazeThe bonus of Koya Bar is that there was no wait while there was long queue for Koya.

Seeing as half of our party was meat eaters and the the other half vegetarian/pescetarian, Koya Bar was the perfect fit as they offer a variety of options. Koya Bar is, like with many other London eateries, on the smaller scale, with an open kitchen and a bar surrounding it. Luckily, the seven of us managed to get a seat before the dinner rush.Aside from offering various udon dishes, Koya Bar also has donburi (a bowl of rice topped with something) and side items like tempura, pork belly and vegetables. Next time I'm in London, I'll definitely make a trip to Koya Bar again! From our experience it's best to get there around six-ish or even earlier, as the place fills up quickly and there's always a queue, even on a week day! And they don't take reservations. The people who work there are friendly and you can tell, dedicated and passionate about udon and good Japanese food.",

    "text": "I really love the idea of getting the food cooked right in front of myself, which is absolutely the case at Koya. Overall, it has a very nice \"minuscule bar in Tokyo\" feel, which I liked - it could draw attention to itself a bit better, though (maybe a bigger sign?).The cooks are at the same time the servers and friendly.The food was on top, as well. I also ordered green tea, which came in a lovely little ceramic pot. Despite the fact that the place was absolutely packed even at 10pm, it didn't take too long until I found myself enjoying some amazing udon.Absolutely do come early, though, as the bar can accommodate perhaps 15-20 people, consequently bringing a group of friends might be a problem.The toilets are nice and tidy, and - like the rest of the bar - tastefully decorated in a modern Japanese style.I know where I'll be eating at my next visit to London.",

The 25 seater bar had a very cozy feel and everybody was seated rapidly - the star of the restaurant is udon and the pork miso one I had was very delicious - just the right size for me - I wish that they had served the egg with the udon rather than first as I think the two would have gone together. Next time will order more small plates to share and maybe bring one addidtional person tops.",

Koya Bar is the answer!!We were waiting in line for Koya when the hostess said we could try Koya Bar next door with no wait ....so of course we did! They told us the menus are slightly different and also the seating is all bar seating. Rotations are fast so even if all of the seats are taken you should be able to get a seat fairly quickly.We started with the pork belly which was super tender and full of flavor. The udon was wonderful and the broth was light. I ordered a soft boiled egg which came in shell. I made a slight mess getting it into my bowl. Tip: Normally when I order a soft boiled egg for noodles, it comes in the soup already. Here they provide a cold pre-boiled soft egg in shell. Make a small crack and \u00a0let the egg pour out for the broth to cook it.",

Crazily a new colleague and I happened to get talking about where she a group of friends could go for dinner, I thought well B.I.N.G.O, \u00a0you're talking to the right girl. I gave her a few of my favourites to think about and she in return, mentioned Koya, \"Oh yeah they do this amazing poached egg\". Eggs, d.d..d...did you say poached egg? I had to explain about my sheer devotion to this food group, my favourite thing, poached eggs. I usually pass the Koya Restaurant's round the block queues, yearning for the day I may be able to get a coveted table, at this, no bookings eatery. \u00a0However at noon, I breezed straight in to the Koya Bar and was warmly welcomed and talked through the menu, chatted to the chefs prepping and had a lovely time. It was a great atmosphere to get some work done before a meeting, very calming, zen you might say. The poached egg was unusually cold, but still runny in a tasty miso broth. I chose a seaweed salad and barely battered, battered artichoke heart, in a crispy veil of tempura, served with an intriguing pinch of smokey aromatic grits. Really precise subtle clean flavours. I could appreciate every amount of effort in every morsel. There was a contented hush among the early smattering of diners all very much contemplating the flavours.A little pricey but worth it.",

But if I were to compare with the food next door, it would only deserve 4. I was at Koya couple weeks ago and had a bomb duck udon. I loved it soooo much I ordered the same dish. Unfortunately, the duck is a bit dough-ie and it's not the rare juicy duck breast at Koya. The soup and udon are still out of the world yum!It boils down to : if there is not a line, go to Koya, but if there is, the bar will do the job.",

We thought we would have no chance of getting seated, but Koya Bar proved us wrong.Call it luck or great management, the accommodating manager sat us within 10 minutes upon arrival and, during the wait, gave us beers and water.Koya specializes in freshly made udon served many ways (hot udon in hot broth, cold udon in hot broth, cold udon in cold dipping sauce, etc), and at Koya Bar, you would see the udon made in front of you.We shared Kaiso (mixed seaweed) salad and Atsu-Age (fried and grilled tofu). I didn't care for the seaweed salad too much, but the tofu was nicely done. The highlight was indeed the udon. The Kinoko Hiya-Atsu (cold udon served with a hot mushroom broth along with walnut miso) was fantastic. The udon was chewy and easy to eat, one could easily taste the shiitake mushrooms in the broth, and the walnut miso was extraordinary (sweet and savory). Perhaps I don't know any better, but my only minor gripe was that it was challenging to combine the walnut miso with the udon and the broth. Once the miso was in the broth, I couldn't taste the flavor so much, so I mostly ate the miso separately from the rest.The prices were a bit high, but for fresh and delectable udons, it was totally worth it.",

Ordered a variety of dishes.Firstly it must be said that the udon here is very good, even better than at Koya next door, perhaps because many of the original staff there have moved across to Koya Bar.I had the Niku Udon which is a hot udon in hot broth with thinly sliced beef, atsu atsu style! I enjoyed it very much and will definitely come back on a cold day. The noodles are freshly made in front of you and very springy and a bit chewy.I also had the Ten Mori which is a tempura assortment. This was delicious, the batter light and crispy, and the prawn and vegetables fresh. My only niggle is that it is just a bit oily, and perhaps they could pat it down a bit before serving.I tried my friends side of the Fish and Chips. Unfortunately this was disappointing. Firstly they forgot we ordered it, small mistake. But for the dish itself, the fish was average and a small portion. The chips were a type of tempura yam. It tasted nice but was incredibly greasy. We had two bites of the chips and left the rest.The menu at Koya Bar has a good range of items and is reasonably priced. I will be back should I want some hot udon!",

I am an udon girl through and through!Having just come back from Japan, based on a direct comparison, Koya Bar's specialized udon really holds its own against indigenous udon from the Land of the Rising Sun.I'll state Koya's single downside first. The wait can be long because they don't take reservations, and this joint is RIDICULOUSLY popular. However, if you're coming with a small party (under 3 people), you will be seated MUCH more quickly. In any case, they manage the line very well, making sure nobody cuts and everyone is accommodated in a fair order, so no complaints really.Now, THE FOOD. They have a diverse selection of different broths, each complex and unique in its flavor. Gingery, meaty, bright, Koya's broths are excellent.The texture of the udon too was amazing. Each noodle strand was formulated and cooked to perfection. If you had tempura, it was crispy and hot, but started getting that delicious melty texture when immersed in the broth.I recommend always getting some of the fresh specials on their seasonal menu. Everything is carefully curated, and there's something at Koya for everyone! Carnivores, vegans (but why.), locals, foreigners, etc.I can't write anymore because I'll start drooling, but if you're visiting and don't know what to eat, this is a fantastic option. If you're a London local, shame on you if you haven't visited here yet.I HAVE SPOKEN.",

    "text": "Koya bar is a beautiful little eatery containing an open kitchen and walled off by a bar with high stools for seating on the other side so customers can watch food being prepared. It is a good representation of what one is usually like in Japan with it's wooden decor and small seating space. As well as serving udon they are only a few places in London that serves traditional Japanese breakfast every day of the week opening as early as 8:30am to accommodate that. They also have a special menu that changes regularly including grilled fish of the day and serve a variety of traditional dishes for lunch and dinner as well The problem is that not all of the staff are friendly. Some can be quite stern, short and abrupt, giving service without a smile. Kedgeree This was a creative fusion of the original dish and using short grain rice and a lot of water content to create it instead. It was more like Chinese congee texture. Sadly flavours didn't realyl deliver, lacking depth and umami. \u00a0The chunks of cured haddock were quite a nice addition adding saltiness although quite dense in texture, losing too much of it's moisture from the curing process. Curry flavour was mild but a nice touch of bonito flakes on the side for a burst of flavour. A poached egg to add that creaminess in replacement of butter and cream like the original kedgeree recipe. It was a creative dish but the broth base needs to be stronger, to add depth and flavourCurry udon This was very satisfying. Probably not a breakfast dish itself but I love it. The udon were thick, bouncy and a nice long length which made it great for slurping. The curry itself was fragrant, rich and thick, attaching itself to every strand of udon. It was mild in spice which allowed big warm soothing mouthfuls to capture all the lovely flavour. The few broccoli florets it came with was nicely grilled and soft, giving a nice sweet smokiness to the curry udon. Japanese breakfast Is was very like how they serve it traditionally in Japan although a more formal breakfast nowadays. A bit disappointed with the pickles being the generic pickled beetroot rather than daikon or turnips. As much as I love beetroot I do hope to experience more traditional vegetables that you would receive in Japan. The grilled fish of the day that came with the set was brill which was cured nicely, flakey and meaty. Went well with a simple bowl of rice and a lovely freshly made miso soup with deep fried silken tofu and carrot for a nice subtle sweetness.I did very much enjoy my experience at Koya bar although I felt many improvements could have been made as well. Staff need to be more hospitable as it was the reason why my partner rated this place a two. Kedgeree needed more depth and the cured fish inside could have been more softer. The menu is full of creativity but then it leads me to question why they use ready made pickled beetroot rather than pickling their own. Still, going to Koya bar evolved some nostalgic memories of days in Japan, wanting a quick and easy bowl of udon.",

    "text": "Koya Bar, Frith Street - Koya Bar is a proper Japanese noodle bar. In the night of Soho lights, it sits humbly among the other eateries with their attractive and catchy signs. A black shop front with large glass window and a one door entrance, it would have been easier to keep an eye out for their logo. Did it attract any less customers? No, in fact, queues can build up easily as seating are limited. Koya Bar does not take reservations and you will only be seated when all of your companions have arrived.fish and chips \u00a39.10 - served as a starter, small plate, sharing style it is the Koya's take on English fish and chips. Brilliant! I suspect that the chips were from a sweet vegetable like plantain or sweet potato. It was feather light like the batter on the fish. No vinegar or tomato sauce but served with their dipping sauce of radish and spring onions, it was so delicious that we didn't stop eating until the plate was empty. kamonabe (duck and vegetable hot pot) \u00a314.30 - from a spectator's view, I thought that they were a little mean on the duck and vegetable. My dining companion confirmed that it had the proper proportion of udon to filling to broth. It was good but the broth was a little on the oily side.hiya-hiya zaru udon tenzaru (cold udon with cold sauce to dip with prawn and vegetable tempura) \u00a313.90 - after the fish and chips, I was glad that I chose the tempura to go with my noodles. It was delightfully crispy and each bite into the batter was so satisfying. The kind of batter that possibly every OCD foodie/chef is trying to create at home. I give up, and will just dine here from now on. The assortment of vegetables were all but one slightly undercooked.With Koya Bar, it was more than just the food. The place exudes the Japanese culture of eating and looking around the place for a moment, I could be fooled that we were in Japan. Koya Bar was full and most had their heads down totally engrossed in their bowls of udon, I was quite amazed that a steaming hot broth noodles was favoured equally well in the West as in Asia. I thought it was only the kind of dish only understood by the Asians. Seating by the bar might not be suitable on certain occasions - like if you have a crowd of friends \u00a0or have sharing dishes - but on second thoughts, sitting opposite someone who slurps their noodles is not particularly inviting. I still have to work my way through the menu - udon noodles being the main which comes with different toppings, rice in donburi style and various small plates to choose from. Not to mention that there are specials from time to time. What seemed like a small portion of noodles turned out to be quite filling and with a small plate to share between the two of us, I was full. A good place for simple yet flavoursome food. No desserts served and I did find myself wanting one.Koya Bar exudes a casualness with personality and integrity. It is not the kind of glamorous place with awkward formalities, numerous cutlery, hostile service and an expensive menu that makes you think twice but if I were taken on a date here, I am glad to walk away with the date that knows and has good taste!Will I be back for more? You can certainly count on it!",

I settled on the kitsune udon with onsen tamago and the fish that was written on the daily special. Maybe it was because I arrived at the odd time of 11:50 (right between breakfast and lunch), but I think my order took a long time. Another couple arrived after I was nearly finished and they seemed to receive their order in less than half the time I did. The egg was cooked perfectly, with a yolk that only barely kept its shape in the broth and the whites were just wisps. I finished almost all of the soup and the noodles had a great texture, as did the tofu. Just like in Japan. However, I have to say I was a little disappointed with the fish. It was delicious and nicely grilled, but I didn't feel it was worth \u00a39 even though it came with some lovely pickles. But I guess London is expensive and that should be expected. I would definitely come here again when the udon craving hits, though I will stick to the udon and show up at a more reasonable hour.",

The Kirin beer was more expensive than usual but when it came I realised the price was because it was the premium brew and it was really delicious.

    "text": "I think I have tried udon noodles in every city or town I've ever lived in, so to say that I'm a fan of udon is very much an understatement. Having now qualified myself as an udon expert, I think Koya Bar serves some of the best noodles I've had! Thick, chewy, freshly made noodles in tastefully made broths, with some nice surprise small plates that change often (keeps visits fun, right?).As a pescetarian, my options are more limited due to not being able to have the dishes made with pork broth. I usually order the curry or the mixed seaweed and both are delicious every time. The ingredients (veg and seaweed) actually change according to the season and what they have in the kitchen, so I'm actually never bored. In the curry, sometimes I'll get pumpkin, or squash, or aubergines, and the seaweed selection is never quite the same. Other people seem to really like their walnut miso and mushroom dish, so any lover of mushroom (which I am not) might like to try that one since it does come recommended. The cold noodles are also wonderful if you're craving a particularly chewy texture. Refreshing and just right for a warm day. My husband loves a variety of their meat options, by the way.I think there are a few people who complain that the flavour can be very bland and the portions too small. I've never had a problem with a less salty dish, to be honest. I've always loved the more subtle and cleaner tasting broth. I've had many udon soups in Japan itself and found those to be way too salty. I guess it's just a matter of preference! As for the portion, they're not huge and quite pricey, which is why my rating is a 4 rather than a 5, but I always thought the servings were just about right. That might just be me, though!You can also fill up on the smaller plates, some which have been yummy, others that have been misses. It's when you get the 'misses' that hurt because of the hefty price, but I've never had one that was downright terrible.In general, I like the former Koya restaurant better because the options for the small plates were always very good, but since that's closed now, this is now my go-to place when my udon craving kicks in. And I'm still pretty happy about that.",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast on the weekend, at first glance you get the feel you are at one of the more contemporary ramen bars you get in Tokyo near a train station.I come in and hear the usual 'irashimasen' welcoming you into the restaurant, although here it was a bit limp and unenthusiastic (compared to the roar you get in Japan).We weren't welcomed in by anyone so walked up to the bar to ask for a seat and that we had a reservation but the waitress just looked at us as if we insulted her. For a second, I thought I had said something to scare her but I really hadn't. After eventually coming to an agreement that we want to sit and eat, we found the menu already on the table for us and a bottle of tap water, it's always good when you don't have to ask for water so when it was automatically provided, I was glad and it took away a bit of the bad feelings my initial experience left me with. Also free water is commonplace in Japan, you will pretty much always get free water or even tea sometimes.The food for breakfast was ok, there was nothing wrong with it. Kind of resembled Japanese food but lacking some of the flavours and scents that you experience in Japan. Textures were fairly reminiscent of Japan and it was enjoyable at the very least if you like eating at the bar rather than at a table. The price was too high for what it was, would be at least half of this even in Tokyo and the portions would be bigger.I witnessed the 2 waitresses, including the one that we first encountered, have generally bad manners and poor behaviour towards customers the whole time we were there.Good service goes hand in hand with Japanese dining and this place failed miserably on that front. Waited about 10 minutes to finally get the attention of someone to ask for the bill even after direct eye contact and me asking for the bill several times. I payed, although the whole transaction was so awkward, I felt like I had asked something incredibly unreasonable, maybe they prefer you to not pay? I don't know, Koya was good 3 years ago, sadly I don't have any desire to return. Only come here if you don't care about service.",

Based on the other Yelp reviews I've read, it seems like there was a management change or something in the last few years. I suppose the new seating arrangement makes more sense financially - an added perk is that it feels much less intimidating to go eat on your own, as the old setup meant you were occupying an entire table by yourself, or felt like you had to make small talk with the other individuals put at your table. That said, don't even bother trying to come here with more than 3 people, you'll be left waiting for a while.Udon itself is a fairly simple dish, it's noodles dumped in broth, with meat/vegetables, and garnish, so it's quite easy to make but very difficult to master. While the udon I got (cold noodles in hot broth with beef) was quite good, it didn't have the same depth or \"WOW\" factor that made me remember the place five years later and want to come back. Or maybe I'm just getting senile with age. I'm glad they didn't chock the whole thing full of MSG like so many other places that serve udon though, I could actually drink the broth without feeling like I needed to down an entire bottle of still water (which they do provide you with, free)Still, for a SoHo-area restaurant, the prices were fairly affordable. It took a little while for me to place an order, but at least the bill came fairly quick. Also, there's a guest wifi network, but there's no wifi password anywhere to be seen. What gives?Verdict: Not bad, good as a no-frills go-to place, but I'd still come back.Yay: Good for individuals, prices, very little to no MSG in the brothNay: Not good for groupsMeh: It wasn't as good as I remembered it to be",

Ambience was casual -- all seats were along the bar, where food was served over the counter. A bit on the small side in terms of space, but perhaps, this adds to the low-key, local feel of it all.

Exactly what I needed after a long flight! Will definitely come again if I have the chance.",

Fresh prawn and vegetable with good batter. The experience was fantastic. There are limited seats in Koya. This is because the setting is of a bar style. You get to see the chef preparing it right in front of your eyes. The only thing that I have to comment is the friendliness of the staffs. Perhaps due to the busy-ness of the restaurant, I feel that the staffs can be a tad friendlier. Despite that, I would definitely return to this place for the food and experience.",

I haven't had udon in a while and this was better than I remembered.I got a classic - cold udon noodles with miso and pork broth - really tasty broth with chunks of pork mince and a faint taste of sherry? Some sort of booze but it tastes divine. While I was waiting I also had a miso soup (was very hungover and needed all of the liquids). When you sit down at the bar you get a 1/2 litre bottle of water which is always a nice touch.Besides the broth, which was really excellent, I was surprised with the tofu in my miso, I always think MEH when I think tofu and this was very good.As for queues and timing, I went at 6.30 and there were 4 people ahead of me in the queue. By the time I left there were at least 20, so I guess it pays off to come early or at a weird dining time. Enjoy!",

The prawns were ginormous and meaty, definitely the largest prawns I've ever seen in a tempura platter. We ordered the ktisune udon and the pork miso udon (both hot), perfect for a cold winter evening. The broths were simple, light, and very tasty. The noodles were cooked perfectly and slurped down quite quickly.While the food was tasty, I had to minus one star for the service. The wait staff was extremely friendly, but so slow. It took us a good 15 minutes after being seated for someone to take our order. Granted there were only 2 waiters for the small place, and just two cooks.",

We walked past and decided to give a Japanese Breakfast a try. The food isn't horrible, but the food is not worth the price. I understand that it is Soho, but then I expect something with flavors that wow. I was not quite sure whether to be pleased or to be disappointed about the time that we needed to wait for the food to be prepared. There were three other people in the restaurant.We ordered the Curry Udon and the Japanese Breakfast. I had different expectations for $34 breakfast without alcohol. For example to actually feel comfortably full or to get bouncy/chewy udon noodle. The curry was not bad but the udon noodles were a bit overdone. Maybe the lunch and evening menu are a better bang for your buck/pound.",

This place does savoury things only and if the thought of eating fish for breakfast doesn't set you off, well this is worth a try.They have 3 types of breakfasts: udon noodles; rice porridge (all with different toppings) or a japanese menu with grilled fish, pickles, rice and miso soup.First time we tried the menu and unfortunatly the fish (mackerel) was very very dry so we were a bit disappointed. If you want to give it a try, ask what the fish of the day is (second time they had haddock and it didn't look dry).We also tried the udon (egg and soya sauce for me) and the rice porridge (spring onions, haddock and egg for him) and that was delicious. Quite pricey but good idea for a special occasion breakfast (\u00a324 for 2 meals and 2 teas).Service is a bit slow - but they do cook everything in front of you so it helps pass the time.",

This wasn't our first pick since we were wanting beef but they ran out of beef at 6:15 PM when we were seated. Bill was around \u00a327.The food was pretty good except the pork and miso ramen didn't have much pork in it and little veggies.

Anyway, sweet tofu udon was on point. Sweet tofu was one whole slab of tofu and udon was cooked perfectly. The bowl was a lot bigger than it looked, so I ate slowly and ended up having overcooked udon by the end. We had some delicious udon in Honolulu, which was rated one of the best in the states, but Koya Bar definitely has them beat :) Then we shared a pork belly. And it was amazingg. Usually the fat in pork belly makes me feel so guilty that I cannot enjoy it, but this was the most tender, melt in your mouth meat that the fat was the perfect compliment. It came with this generous serving of fresh wasabi, that was just as impressive as the rest of the meal. I cannot recommend Koya Bar enough. Long lines during prime dinner times, but so worth the wait.",

The taste was good and it was filling enough. You can see from my photo that the dish looks tasty, and it was! My friend had a bowl of udon which he thought was very good. To conclude.. This restaurant isn't just good for Udon, it's good for Donburi too! I'm just giving 3/5 because I wasn't mind-blown, and the restaurant's music playing was simply Radio 1, which was too loud and lost the authentic Japanese experience.I will go back to eat more!",

    "text": "Koya is a small, authentic Japanese noodle bar specialising in all sorts of udon. Seating is around a long bar table facing the cooking area which can give you a nice glimpse of the chef preparing your dish. My friend and I both got the buta miso (his favourite) which is hot udon with pork and miso as well as a couple of sharing plates. The udon noodles itself is thick and with a lovely texture, and the hot broth held a lot of flavour. The pork is sweet which was surprising but worked well overall with the dish. Bear in mind, an udon dish is quite simple! It's quite literally thick, flat noodles plopped into a bowl of broth and a spoon of topping dumped over it but the magic is in the depth of flavour that contains. The only turn off was the price. The udon itself is alright - a bowl costs around \u00a310 - but the small plates tend to be quite pricey. A plate of a few pieces of vegetable tempura and 2 pieces of prawn cost a whopping \u00a312. Definitely not good value. Not entirely sure if I will revisit. There are other more affordable Japanese joints in this city which might take precedence.",

    "text": "Decided to get some udon at Koya Soho with a friend on a Saturday. I got the Niku udon. The broth is lighter than I'd like and missing an umami quality a beef udon should have. Broth flavors were mainly ginger notes and dashi essence. Furthermore, the noodles were slightly overcooked and soft. I doubt the noodles are being made in house from scratch. I also ordered tanuki which is chopped up tempura bits. This topping lent a fried tempura-ness to the udon. The Niku (beef) itself was thin cut, rare and satisfactory, but nothing particularly remarkable. In addition to udon, my friend and I ordered kakuni, and tsukemono. Kakuni is served in a bowl, stewing in its own juices. A dab of wasabi on the side. Melty and fatty. Unami. Wasabi offers a spicy nuance. Mild salty seasoning. Tsukemono was also enjoyable, crunchy fermented greens and roots. Salty and tangy fermented character was an excellent palate cleanser for the meal.While I think the main attraction, the udon, is satisfactory at best, the sides are the hidden gems of the menu at Koya Soho.",

The udons were amazing, although we didn't get to try the one I had targeted going in (the hiyashi buta miso -- they were all out by the time we got there). The tempura is an absolute must as well.

As soon as I bit down into my tempura and noodles, I was home. It was all worth it.Fresh, crunchy tempura with giant prawns and vegetables. Delicate, flavourful noodles and dashi broth. The saba udon was hot, flaky and packed with umami. Beware of the lone fishbone. Otherwise you can go as slow as you want.My friend had the curry and it was thick and delicious. Very filling and enriching. My companion had the miso pork which had depth and a salty broth. Such a joy in every bite.I recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the best of Japanese cuisine in a bar setting. I cannot wait to return.",

If you don't mind waiting at least 30 minutes on a weekend night, then you'll find yourself deciding among a ton of udon options to try. The menu features a ton of options for your udon, whether you prefer it hot or cold, with broth or sauce, and different toppings. The food came pretty quickly after we ordered. My friend and I both got the cold udon with sesame sauce for dipping. This was delicious. The sesame sauce is thick and flavorful and the udon is firm and chewy. No matter what udon you choose, you also have to get the prawn and vegetable tempura. The tempura is crunchy and the prawns are huge and delicious! Each serving comes with two prawns so this is great for sharing too! The menu also featured some small plates. We tried the agedashi tofu, which was good but it uses hard tofu and I prefer soft tofu. Overall, I really enjoyed the udon and tempura here. Can't wait to return when I crave udon!",

The udon was of perfect bite/texture and the pour over sauce went well with it.iso pork was salty and a tiny bit sweetness so it was tasty when mixed into the noodles and the sauce. I added some green onions and then ginger whenever I wanted a little spicy kick. Radish on the side to clean my palate between bites of other food items+ Vegetable tempura: thought this was okay. The batter was light, still greasy especially with the starchy vegetables. Fairly large size order- attempted to order the \"fish and chips\" but they didn't have any that dayAMBIANCE/DECORCozy small shop with counter seating around the kitchen. Everything seems neat and tidy. I sat in front of the noodle chef who called out orders from time to time. The place was fairly quiet and patrons mainly dined alone or some with one other companion. No hooks under table for jackets or purses, but coat hooks on the wall to the right when you walk in. Restroom available was clean too.SERVICEGood service and food came at a good pace. I didn't have to wait long at all. I was asked to move one seat over because a small group of people came and wanted more space to sit together. I didn't hear the waitress tell them she will ask me to move over so I think it was the customers' request. It was fine. I'm not claustrophobic :)Are at my own pace and was not rushed to pay bill. Overall, I really liked their udon and would come back to try other items when I'm back in London! I even offered my husband to come for another meal (he's never been), but we decided to eat elsewhere the rest of our stay in London. So yea, I would recommend this place!",

They have a ton of options for udon it's a bit overwhelming but also great way to get you to come back and try the different flavors. MUST-GET: Any of their udons! Probably go with the cold udon so it's chewier. Although when it's cold outside, it's nice to just have a large bowl of hot udon and soup. I really enjoyed the Niku udon. I love their clear soup, it's not too oily like most ramen soup and it's very refreshing. Their tempura is also delicious! Unlike most tempura outside of Japan, their tempura batter is light and crisp. Lastly, I was surprised by the atsu age (fried-grilled tofu) - it's simple (just fried tofu in soy sauce) yet you just can't stop eating it for some reason.DON'T GET: Gyu-katsu, it's not bad but also not amazing so I would save your tummy space for something else.OTHER TIPS: Go early or late for the meal to avoid the line, we went at 8:30pm and waited for around 20minutes before we got seated.",

Found this place on Yelp, and my friend and I made our way here at around 9PM on a Saturday night. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (5th in line), but the queue quickly grew and was out the door shortly after we were seated.We ordered the pork belly appetizer, niku udon, and duck hotpot udon. The pork belly was tasty, but extremely fatty (50%+ of each piece was pure fat); there wasn't anything really remarkable about it otherwise. The niku udon was much better than the duck, in my opinion, as the rather large chunks of duck meat quickly became chewy as they cooked in the broth, while the thinly sliced beef in the niku was more suited to maintain a tender texture through the meal.The broth of the soups were clean and fresh, not at all too salty or heavy. The noodles however, were a disappointment as they became very soggy/overcooked and started breaking apart in the hot broth. Perhaps the cold dipping noodles are a good way to go to avoid this, but my favorite udon spots in NYC don't have this problem.Bar-only seating, which is cool as you can watch the chefs work.",

The flavor and texture was better than Shin, the top-rated Udon place in Tokyo.We did some tempura as well, which was outrageously good. This was easily the best shrimp tempura I've ever had even having traveled recently to Japan. We had quick, friendly service throughout the evening.

I miss this place so much, wish we had one in California. It made me fall in love with udon!If the tempura cabbage is on the menu, order it!! Wow.I recommend all the udon bowls, but especially buta miso and the shrimp tempura.",

My friend had the udon but the portion didn't seem as big compared to other common noodle places you'd see. I had the gyudon and again, smaller portions than other restaurants, but it was still great!",

    "text": "This time I came food was probably more like a 4.25 but I'm gonna round up to a 5 for old times sake.Just gotta love koya! Always trusty, it never disappoints. Udon is always great. I like kitsune Atsu atsu just because it's classic and you can always count on it being delicious. My boyfriend had the miso pork hiya atsu and that was realllly great too. Prawn Tempura was on point. Came with a good smattering of extra tempura crunch I could just scatter all over my udon. You can tell I was very pleased! I did wish they had a better selection of small plates/ daily specials though, but probably just bad luck on the day I went. Last time I was here they had amazing chicken karaage, so get that if you see it on the specials!",

My friend told me about Koya and since I love udon I had to try it. \u00a0It was later in the afternoon so I was lucky to get a seat right away.Food: I ordered the Buta Udon which was simple, had amazing flavor and was perfect.I also ordered a ride of wings which were ok. \u00a0Next time I'm going to try the pork belly.Drinks: I ordered the homemade lemonade which was delicious. Very mild, not tart at all with a hint of honey.Price: \u00a324.05Service: \u00a0Very friendlyAmbiance: Its very cozy with just a long bar with the chefs cooking. Probably seats about 20 people. Would I go back? Yes! I love noodles and I want to try all of the udons on the menu!",

The flavor and texture was good, udon was authentic but wasn't the best I ever had. Good place to eat if you are in the area and craving udon but I wouldn't wait if there was a long wait. Bar seating only so not ideal with a group.",

The broth was on point and the noodles were terrific. Some of the best Udon I've had in years. Great for a cold weather day. Service was quick and efficient. They have a small sake list which is solid.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is quaint and reminiscent of small Tokyo noodle spots, but the food is pretty awful. We ordered the niku udon and breaded beef small plate. The beef in my udon was served raw which would be fine except the broth was not nearly hot enough to cook the beef through. It was REALLY oily, full of fat, and it cooked to a white color (not brown). It tasted like gelatinous, mushy pork in a kind of herb tinted soup. It was pretty bad. I tried my husband's breaded beef dish and couldn't even bite through it. It was SO chewy... Maybe we came on an off night, but that was probably the worst food I've had in a long time.",
