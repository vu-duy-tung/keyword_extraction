However, luckily, Nandos have a great vegetarian menu. I usually have the bean burger which is really nice. To be honest, I think the main thing which makes Nandos stand out is the spicey flavourings they have - really tasty and unusual in fast food restaurants! You can buy the bottles for home too mmmmm! I like that Nandos is fast food which is healthier and tastier than most of the crap around nowadays! Would definitely recommend, particularly to people who like spicey food (you can get it without spice but I don't think it's as nice)",

Service at this restaurant is pretty good as well, though during rush hours the waitresses/waiters do seem a bit rushed.

And a side of chips/fries.The gentlemen who brought me my burger was congenial. The \"medium\" hot sauce looked like melted cheese; he informed to the contrary. Naturally, I was confused - maybe I was just hungry...The veggie burger was decent. The bread was great. The \"medium\" sauce was spicy and worth investigating another time. The one-leaf of lettuce was sad and paltry. The one slice of tomato was an afterthought.Overall \u00a0- I was just let down. For \u00a38.75 I anticipated a decent meal of quality.

    "text": "Having been to a few Nando's in my life, I've got a feel for whether a branch is a good'un or not. This one is pretty average, though having said that I've always been here with a very (about 30-40 people) large group and so maybe standards just slip with a rush of orders all at the same time. The food is usual Nando's fare - if you don't like chicken, you're in the wrong place - and bottomless drinks are fantastic. So to make some comparison I have to go on how much food I got, how well it was cooked, service and surroundings. Firstly, quantity. I probably got the most miserly portion of chips this time round. Usually Nando's fill your plate but not this time so I was fairly disappointed with that. I also had a double chicken wrap and was expecting a bit more filling (it looked like I'd just got a single one!). It was cooked well however and service was very quick and the staff very helpful considering our group size. I love that for large groups they take your name so that everyone gets the right food in the right order, though obviously if your name is a bit tricky it results in much hilarity listening to them try to pronounce it, as with one of my friends Welsh name! Lastly, surroundings. I love the look of this branch, highly amusing is the wall made out of drinks cans upstairs, and it's all very open and airy which is great. Overall a good meal, though I wish I'd had more of it!",

The chikcen is decent enough, but I tend to go for the veggie burger, which I'm actually quite fond of, and yesterday I tried the beanie burger, which was also quite nice. The macho peas are a great side, and everything else I've tasted has been done well and is full of flavour. This particular branch is one I've visited a few times, usually after a concert. This means that we end up going with a huge group of students, and often quite a few instruments too. They're always welcoming, and there's usually space upstairs for us to sit, no matter how many (although we do usually try to book it as well!). The only problem I've had with this one is...they didn't have any veggie burgers yesterday. Which lost them a star. That may seem a little harsh, but...well, if they have it next time I go back, we might be able to rectify that.",

I ordered up a 1/4 chicken combo with some corn on the cob and my wife had a chicken sandwich. Both came quickly and were very tasty. The chicken was juicy and the fries and corn were both excellent. The nice thing about Nando's is that their chicken is grilled, not fried, so it's a little better for you. All of it was very reasonably priced.

    "text": "It was our first night in London and while the time on our watches read 11pm, my belly thought it was 6pm. American Airlines' surprisingly decent airplane food aside, I was hungry. My quest for food took me through the non-grid like streets of this charming London neighborhood of gardens, roads and...restaurants closing by 11? Past the last seating so no more eating?Let's try a pub which revealed a crowded scene of happy revelers drinking but not eating. There would be plenty of time for a London pub experience but not at the moment.What to do? Enter Nando's, a chain from South Africa serving up Portuguese eats. The existence and encounter with Nando's that night saved us from raiding the packed emergency supply of Kellog's Special K bars or hitting the local Tesco's. (Which we didn't know existed at the moment).The order of operations at Nando's is slightly different than most restaurants. You are assigned a table, complete with number, and peruse the menu. Once ready to order, up you to go to the counter, tell them what you want and your table number, pay and moments later the feast is brought to your table.Under the circumstances of near starvation, this non-traditional method may have been too much but then I tasted my first bite of lemon herb chicken and was suddenly asking why there isn't a Nando's in my home town of NYC. (Washington DC is the only bastion of Nando's flavor in the US).We ordered a meal platter which includes a whole chicken and two regular sides for 18.95 pounds. This was the kind of chicken where manners are cast aside (Why look, they gave me a real knife and fork, neither a spork nor one made of plastic!) and a full hands-on, fingers in, meat and skin deep delight just happens spontaneously.The creamy mash was a hit as side #1-- surprisingly sweet and regrettably gone in moments as we gorged upon our first meal in Great Britain. Side #2, garlic bread, was also quite good and fresh, an unexpected plus when the place is preparing to shut down by midnight.The vibrant multicultural 21st Century city that is London is served well by Nando's. It was a fitting place for my first meal in the Metropole and readily disproves the myth of poor eating options across the pond. And it earns extra points for rhyming with Lando (Calrissian, of course).",

    "text": "This is by far my favourite Nando's in all of London. Perhaps I'm a bit partial that it was less than a 5 minute walk from our flat. This particular location is great in the spring/summer time, as there are some tables outside along the road where you can sit outside and enjoy the bustle of the Gloucester Road / South Kensington area.What to order:* The chicken burgers and pitas are best. The reason for this is that the flavouring is more plentiful on these than on the whole/half chickens.* The peri peri chips are tasty. The peri peri seasoning makes them good. The ordinary chips are all right. (I'm not a chip girl)* The corn is tasty. How can you mess up corn though?Love Nando's and terribly miss this location! Can't wait 'til we can go back!",

Garlic bread is also very good; it's has a nice crunch to it. I do wish the portions were a bit bigger, but I'm not complaining. Drinks are also bottomless for around two quid so that's a perk too.

After a long day of hitting London's tourist attractions and then fighting our way home during the Tube strike, most of the other restaurants were closed and the pubs had stopped serving food. Nando's was the only (decently affordable) place still open, so we figured we'd give it a try.We ended up really liking it. Of course, we got carded when we tried to buy beer (and we are 25-26, NOT under 18) but at least the cashier had a good sense of humor about it. My friend had some sort of chicken burger, and I had one of the veggie burgers (I believe it was the one made mostly of beans), which was delish. Some things were a bit odd (trying to figure out where to get condiments, where the napkins were, etc.), but it was quick, cheap, and good, so no real complaints here!",

I had the half chicken and was disappointed that they could not do all dark meat. Putting that aside though, the chicken was tiny and dry. Thank goodness there were several peri peri dipping sauces, which were interesting and flavorful. The peri peri fries were just normal fries with a sprinkling of seasoning and not worth extra money. The mushy peas are a London staple and an acquired taste. I liked them, but I can see why people may not be as into them. Overall I think Boston Markets, Sonoma Chicken Coop's, and Costco's chicken are all better that Nando's. One plus was the self-service soda and ice machine, both rarities in London.",

Great spot by the river, buzzing atmosphere and cleanly laid out. Family friendly, good for groups, business lunches, no need for booking, and you can even take out! Best during summer time. Food? After experimenting with the menu, I have found the chicken breast in pitta and chicken burgers to be the most satisfying and flavorful (remember to add cheese). Houmous with peri-drizzle & pitta serves to be a great appetizer, and the prego steak roll is surprisingly tasty as well. What makes it unique? Bottomless soda, PERI PERI SAUCE, company culture.Downside? Sometimes service can be slow and one can tell the chips have been sitting out on the counter for a while. The only other minor complaint I have would be the dryness of the lettuce and some of the other veggies in the pitta but that's why you douse it in peri-peri!Now all I need now is that Nando's black card...",

Don't knock it till you've rocked it. For the meat-a-tarians of the bunch, everyone around me was snarfing up their food so fast, it had to have been scrumptious.

She really enjoyed her salad as it tasted fresh and the dressing was good. Don't get me wrong my experience wasn't bad but i just didn't see what the hype was as it was okay.",

It's not the cheapest place out there, but it's certainly unique and you won't get food like theirs many other places. Quality is great, prices are acceptable for what you usually get. Only thing I'd take a star off for is that it sometimes takes over half an hour for your food to arrive, especially when it's busy.",

Would not recommend to work there for the 11:30 pm shift. Fries are a bit dry, nothing special there, but anyways, this is a Portuguese restaurant and not a Belgian restraint right? Who am I kidding. It was a fine place and would recommend other people to it.",

Check my profile for more about how I rank restaurants. \u00a0I guess this would be a 2 star type of establishment, because it's considered 'fast food'.",

Super casual environment and I love that the kitchen is open and you can see the large grill where they cook up their delicious chicken! I ordered the flame grilled butterfly chicken breast (medium spice) with two sides. A delicious piece of chicken flame grilled WITH the crispy skin cooked to perfection :) As a carb lover, I chose the garlic bread and french fries for my side. French fries were pretty standard and the garlic bread provided was two slices of garlic and herb grilled bread served hot and toasty. They also have bottled sauces that you can add to your meal. I believe we tried the garlic and their standard peri-peri. The garlic was pretty hot! Aside from the chicken, one of the things I liked about this restaurant was the unlimited refills on the beverages AND the self-serve ice machine :) I had heard about the lack of ice usage in the UK and I hadn't thought I would miss it, but I did.The people here were friendly, food came out quickly and hot! Great little casual restaurant for a quick hot meal!",

    "text": "As they say, everything is relative to your own personal experiences. I guess the glowing reviews on here are from people who have not had great rotisserie chicken because coming from Miami where we have Latin and Caribbean influences on rotisserie chicken this place really falls short. Portion sizes are so small, ordered a quarter chicken and it was maybe 4 bites, chicken breast must have come from a baby chicken as it was about 5 bites. They have a million sauces to choose from because they don't know how to season and marinate the chicken correctly so they want you to throw a ton of sauce on it to mask the fact the the chicken is flavorless and rubbery. Ordered corn on the cob and mashed potatoes and those were bad too. Corn on the cob was terrible quality corn and instead of being sweet and juicy it was dry and mushy. Mashed potatoes were just that mashed with no butter or sour cream so again flavorless. Do not listen to glowing reviews, bland chicken and tiny portions make this place a no go.",

No matter how hard I try, I can not keep myself from NOT popping into a Nando's for a quick and tasty meal while on layover--and all for less than \u00a312 (with drink). Is it a chain? Yes. Does it serve semi-basic food? Yes. Do I love it? Yes. It's quick, it's easy, it's consistent, it's delicious. Can't wait to be back for my next round of medium chicken wings with table added Lemon-Herb Peri Peri sauce. **drool**Rumor has it the chain has made its way stateside, to the DC area, but I haven't made the 2 hour drive from Philadelphia yet...",

You can't go wrong at this place! My wife had this flat iron steak sandwich and the steak was good enough to eat by itself",

    "text": "Want chicken wings? Come here. I have to admit that I first learned about Nandos from my little sister who was a One Direction fan (Niall loves Nandos apparently). You seat yourself and you order at the cash register. They'll bring the food to you. You also get your own plates and silverware yourself. They have assorted hot sauces and dressings to share and you can bring whichever you like to your own table. The chicken wings here are so juicy and tender, which is why I give them 5 stars. I got the 10 wing entree with HOT Peli-Peli sauce. HOT was pretty spicy for me, they don't underestimate their spicy. The Peli Peli chips are yummy too and a tad bit spicy as well. (Chips in the UK are like fatter French fries with more potato, not potato chips which are called crisps). They also have three options of sangria which are yummy and great for sharing. It's pretty sweet though, as sangria usually is.",

The potatoe was served with yogurt and seeds. The best part was this is one of the only places in London that gives free refills on soda! That was a highlight for me considering I'm from the usa.",
