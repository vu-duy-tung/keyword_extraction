The lamb was tender and moist, and cooked through well-- which is quite the challenge.Excellent overall, and we were glad to find it.",

Not cheap, by any means, but probably the best curry I've had outside India itself: nicely spiced (fairly mild but enough to add a bit of heat to the dishes) and the amount of food we had with the pre-theatre early evening dinner menu (3 courses for \u00a325 + service) was pretty good too. Having to be in and out within 90 minutes was a pity, but the meal didn't feel hugely rushed, despite the waiter taking our orders for all 3 courses at once. Given how much I've paid for similarly high-end indian meals in far less glamorous places, none of which have come close to this, I'd definitely favour Tamarind.",

    "text": "Pics@Chopstix2Steakniveschopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 Catching up with SC, we ended up heading to Tamarind for dinner. I was looking forward to the meal and we both opted for the tasting menu. A round of various sauces to dip our papadums started us off. Spiced chickpeas with mint chutney and sweetened yoghurt topped with tamarind chutney skewered ground lamb kebab with ginger, chilli, cheese, paprika and basil The chickpeas had a delicate spiciness which was a great contrast to the coolness of mint and yoghurt. The lamb kebab was moist and tasty without a greasy aftertaste. Tiger prawns marinated with ginger, yoghurt, paprika, dill leaves and ajwain This wasn't as positively received as the prawn was either frozen, not fresh or overcooked as it had a mushy texture. After the duo of starters, a tray of various bowls with ladened with our mains arrived. Monkfish chunks marinated with yoghurt, coriander, mint, mint-leaf, green chilli, roasted gram flour and saffron The Monkfish was cooked well with the aroma and taste of lemongrass sealed in the charred bits. The spices harmonised together with an overall sweetness balance. Chicken Tikka in sauce of fresh tomatoes, with ginger, red onions, green chillies and crushed fenugreek leaves I found the chicken tikka to be veering slightly on the sweet side as well. On the vegetables side, we had shiitake mushrooms in pureed spinach, flavoured with cumin and garlic and slow cooked black lentils, a speciality of the Northwest frontier All these were mopped up with a choice of cumin and saffron rice and toasted almond/date naan. For desserts, we had a velvety dark chocolate mousse with a hint of cinnamon and orange zest and basmati rice simmered in milk flavoured with cloves At the end of the dinner, I found the meal to be satisfying. The dishes were all made to be friendly and appeal without pushing the boundaries of the palate of the people I didn't get the spicy explosion that usually comes with Indian cuisine but it does hit all the basic elements.",

    "text": "I had lunch at Tamarind recently. It was my third visit to the place (and the first without the wife, but I won't tell her if you won't) and my third excellent meal. I first visited about two weeks before it received its Michelin star, and last visited not long after Alfred Prassad had replaced Atul Kochhar in the kitchen. Maybe I've been lucky but what I found leaves me slightly bemused by the negative comments here and on other (obviously lesser) review sites. I've had three delicious meals, all with exemplary service and exquisite wines. Yes, it's expensive but you know what? Sometimes quality costs. You can certainly eat great Indian for much less in London - hello Tayyabs, Needoo, etc - but for formal but spicy dining? I'll take Tamarind over its rivals anyday. I'll also take Alfred's cooking over Atul's. That, admittedly, is a very close run thing but there's a lightness to Alfred's dishes that belies their depth of flavour. You'll come away, tingling at the heat-inspired joys but not reeling with a body that's now around 83% ghee. The prices mean this is probably one for special occasions only but that just makes me appreciate it more - and, with a little judicious bread ordering, you could happily share a few bits and pieces with your nearest and dearest and get out at around \u00a335 a head. Just delicious.",

    "text": "Why are the best Indian restaurants in central London such clandestine affairs? First La Porte des Indes, which I must have walked past several times before actually recognising its existence, and now Tamarind. Well not really 'and now' because it has been there for ages, with a Michelin-star no less. While the dining room is typically lavish, for some reason it reminds me of a 20s Chicago speakeasy, the sort of place high society went at night to kick back with some swing music and a bathtub mint julep. With hints of the exotic in its decoration, there is still something disconcerting about a room without windows. While I'm sure there are plenty of exits, it just seems to me to have a tomb feel to it. which isn't ideal for a relaxing meal. The food is of course inspiring, with delicate spices coaxing sensual moans from the taster, rather than the usual cacophony coaxing gasps for water. The taster menu is a particularly good choice is you enjoy the eclectic tastes of the subcontinent. All in all, I would definitely check this place out, particularly at the moment, when the capital's finest eateries are gasping for custom and real deals can be found (I believe their set menu is currently at 1999 prices).",

The service was good. It was pricey, but at ~\u00a335 a head, less so than i had imagined.Normally i would have described the entire experience as enjoyable ... had it not been for the immensely high expectations that i had from this place.

Before I ate at Tamarind my impression was that dining at a good Indian restaurant in London was a wonderful and affordable experience. After my visit to Tamarind, my perception was that dining at this particular restaurant was stupidly expensive, especially considering how mediocre the food was. Tamarind did manage to change my perception of what it takes to be a Michelin starred restaurant. It doesn't seem as such a reputable and exclusive club anymore. Service was phenomenal but the food was just okay. Really, I've had better Indian food at a tenth the price Tamarind charged. And the d\u00e9cor wasn't even all that. I mean, it was kinda nice-looking inside but not what I would expect from (or have seen at other) Michelin starred restaurants. Honestly, it was a bit tattered and in need of some touching up. Service was phenomenal, but ultimately who cares? There's no reason to eat here. It's star-status and astronomical prices are an enigma.",

It came out slowly on plates of starters like shrimps, scallop and other things that were unidentifiable but good, one after the other, in a fancy presentation until all the main courses came out of lamb, chicken, lentils, mustard greens and lots of nan bread and sauces. We could not come close to finishing it and there was nothing served we didn't think was very good. The place is probably a little more pricey that it should be. Our dinner for two with a couple drinks was 198 pounds. A ginger mojito we had was 11.50 pounds alone. Come on people, its only rum, lime, mint, ginger and ginger ale. Yes this is a place to impress someone and surely a safe place for a first time Indian food taster as virtually nothing was spicy that we had. Regardless of the high prices, it was a treat of an experience and I'd go again order off the regular menu which would cost considerably less.",

No. Service and decor are typical Mayfair, but the Indian flavors were not as bright and differentiated as at Imli. Even the 3 sauces served with Pappadum included a cranberry (?) sauce that was more Like jam. Lamb cakes were so finely ground and under-seasoned, they could have been hospital food. Steamed sea bass had a \"fish whiff\" that suggested not the freshest. I will not be going back. There are much better upscale Indian joints nearby.",

    "text": "When Tamarind was first launched in 1995 its unusual decor of gilded Lillies running through the restaurant was a big hit in Mayfair. Very recently I decided to take some friends there and I must admit that the quality of the food is just as good as it was 12 years ago when it first opened. Although the decor looks a bit scuffed but I though to myself I am not going to be eating the decor.Chef Alfred Prasad is still the chef and the quality of his cooking has lost none of its goodness. He still produces consistently perfect dishes, otherwise they wouldn't be open. On this occasion I had a classic North Indian Lamb Biriyani topped witha pastry lid which releases the dish's aromas when lifted;the generous amount of Lamb chunks within were tender and succulent; the rice grains distinctively flavoured with mild aromatic spices. Even something as homely as the Tarka Dhal was sublime. Not all the dishes are as Classic as these.There are new tastes and flavours as well like Paneer Tikka-vegetarian cheese chunks marinated and cooked in a hot charcoal oven, or grilled Kingfish Chunks both light dishes which have a very nice pleasing taste. Whenever I eat Indian food be at someone's house or at a restaurant or cafe I always go for the Rice Dishes because they really know how to cook Rice. I am always amazed at how seperate and perfectly cooked through each grain of Rice is. Basmati Rice which come in numerous varieities is just right for curry and Biryani dishes. Enough digressing-although the prices are high in Mayfair we did not mind paying for the excellent cooking and friendly attentive service for party of 10.",

I've had far better elsewhere. Having lived in California and worked with many Indians, I have had my share of great and tasty Indian food, for much less :))) I was really shocked to pay \u00a380 per person for ok food. The dessert (gulab) was especially disappointing and a little ridiculously presented. Apart from the price, I also was a little puzzled by the cuisine style. We had told me it was a modern twist on Indian food. I didn't see that.But I would say that Tamarind is a nice place, quite dark but pleasant for a date. The staff is really nice and smiling. It is underground, so it all makes it a little claustrophobic to my taste ;)I wouldn't go back, and well prefer a small shabby place and get the full Indian experience at a far better price :)",

The staff seemed really pleased to see us and were helpful and involved in choosing us pre-dinner cocktails. Popadoms came with three diferent dips, none of the usual stuff you get in curry places but they were all interesting and a change is always nice. Then we had a trio of starters, one lamb, one prawn and one vegetable. These were all excellent (and filling). For the main course, we had a lamb curry, a chicken curry (a lot like a masala), a couple of vegetable dishes, naans and rice. One of the naans was flavoured, I can't remember with what, but it was great. Of the other dishes I enjoyed them all, but the chicken was probably the best. I was pretty stuffed after that but there was still dessert to come, luckily this was quite small portions of a chocolate mousse, rice pudding and something else I couldn't identify. Rice pudding was especially tasty. Will definitely be going back here.",

The portions weren't as big as I expected for the price, but they were enough for me. We got the cheese stuffed naan (not enough cheesy stuffiness), the lamb chops (perfect), and the chicken masala (because I'm boring.)I really like the fact that you can see the chefs through the glass, but in a way that doesn't scream Chuck-E-Cheese.

The food is well prepared (a few dishes were a bit bland), and I asked for their house red wine, and it was quite good. In fact if you go there, I would guess you will get a good meal (eventually).But basically this is a repackaging of standard north Indian dishes. Its not bad. But it sure as hell does not justify the cost! Wait, wait, I know what your thinking. Sometime one WANTS to shell out the clams and have an upscale experience. Perhaps you want to impress a client or a hot date with your knowledge of exotic food. Well by all means do it. But I do hope you score that deal, or perhaps a good night kiss, because this place is not a good value proposition. The service was crap. There, I said it. Pure crap. My wine glass sat empty for 10 minutes waiting for attention. After quite a while of waiting, we had to flag someone down to get more rice. WTF? Are you kidding? Tamarind is not a bad restaurant.

Overall good service, nice decor and atmosphere and good but not stand out food. Started out with the scallop appetizer and the chicken kabob. The scallops were cooked perfectly but under seasoned for my taste and barely warm when brought to the table. The chicken kabob was made up of ground chicken, green peppers and spices and had a slight kick to it. It was good but not something I'd go back specifically for. None of the chicken main dishes stood out to me so after describing what I typically enjoy (lots of heat and cardamom, star anise) the waiter recommended a dish that was not on the menu. I also ordered the bread basket. The chicken dish was seasoned excellent and had plenty of heat but unfortunately I failed to ask for chicken breast which I prefer and it definitely needed more sauce. The best part for me is dipping my naan bread in the sauce and unfortunately there wasn't much to dip in! The bread basket consisted of regular naan which was bland, a stuffed naan which I was really excited to try but again tasted bland to me and one that I think was garlic which was decent but not the best I've had. I would give this 3.5 stars (if I could). Good but no comparison to my favorites Zaika and Tamarind in NYC! Forgot to mention the white chocolate dipped mint leaves at the end of the meal....yummy.",

My wine glass was never any less than half full. Our server was very nice and answered all of our questions and provided many recommendations when asked. My brother asked what the spiciest thing on the menu was. Our server told him that while nothing was very spicy, he could certainly tell the chef to make his order extra spicy (which my brother later regretted, because the definition of spicy with Indian food is quite different). The food was very good. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, and definitely enjoyed it. Everyone in my group thoroughly enjoyed their food.All of that being said, I have had Indian food that was just as good, if not better at other Indian restaurants for a fraction of the price. You're paying more for the dining experience, I suppose. But I was extremely happy I wasn't paying the bill. My wallet cannot even comprehend spending that much money. The final bill was more than I spent on my bed and mattress...and is more money than I have in my bank account right now. I don't want to give them a negative review, by any means. It was a great dinner, experience wise it was my best meal in London. I'm just holding the food to a high standard because of the price. It wasn't as good as what we paid for it. The service was.",

The decor here and elegance is quite simply unbelievable and right up there with any other restaurant I have ever eaten at. We chose to split a bottle of red wine and went with the chef's selection. It was incredible. From the incredible appetizers to the dal, naan and chicken tikka masala, this easily goes down as one of my best Indian food experiences ever. My only minor complaint is that the service was a little bit silly with 2-3 servers asking us about water/food/wine and or dessert. This place is also quite expensive, but it is money well spent!",

    "text": "It is difficult to write a review for this place. The food is good. It is comparable to the top Indian restaurants in London like Amaya. The decor and ambience is also pleasant and simple. The main issue with this place is the service. The service is almost arrogant and tries to be smart on customers. They have Head Waiters who take orders and bring bills while the waiters only bring food and clear tables. They have only 2 Head Waiters so when the place is busy no one pays attention to the customers. When we were sat down the Head waiter asked us if he should arrange the dinner! (we were only three) or whether we would like to have a menu (is that a question?). I like to check the menu and while I may ask for recommendations I don't like someone else to choose my food. So when I said we would like to see the menu the service went down the drain from there. No attention at all. We had to call few times for anything including placing an order! We had to call three times to get the dessert menu and when it was given to us no one came to take the order after waiting for 15 minutes. Finally we asked for the bill and decided to leave without ordering any desserts. When the bill arrived we realized why they are hesitant in giving out the menu. They had charged us for dishes that we didn't order no had. After we complained they removed the items without even apologizing. It seems that this is a usual practice. So one has to be very careful here. Will I come back? I don't think so. Service is an important element of a dining experience and this place definitely lacks it.",

It's full of rich, authentic flavours, traditionally and beautifully presented! Service from staff was excellent, they were all very friendly, efficient and helpful.Yes, it is pricey, but well worth the money. If you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate an event like a birthday or an anniversary, Tamarind is perfect. I'll definitely be going there for my next birthday! ;)Oh, and just a polite note to reviewers who complained it was expensive and not worth the money - You're dined in London's Mayfair, one of the City's most affluent areas! If you wanted a cheap curry you should have went to Tooting or Brixton ............. :P",

A round of various sauces to dip our papadums started us off.Spiced chickpeas with mint chutney and sweetened yoghurt topped with tamarind chutney skewered ground lamb kebab with ginger, chilli, cheese, paprika and basilThe chickpeas had a delicate spiciness which was a great contrast to the coolness of mint and yoghurt.The lamb kebab was moist and tasty without a greasy aftertaste.Tiger prawns marinated with ginger, yoghurt, paprika, dill leaves and ajwainThis wasn't as positively received as the prawn was either frozen, not fresh or overcooked as it had a mushy texture.After the duo of starters, a tray of various bowls with ladened with our mains arrived.Monkfish chunks marinated with yoghurt, coriander, mint, mint-leaf, green chilli, roasted gram flour and saffronThe Monkfish was cooked well with the aroma and taste of lemongrass sealed in the charred bits. The spices harmonised together with an overall sweetness balance.Chicken Tikka in sauce of fresh tomatoes, with ginger, red onions, green chillies and crushed fenugreek leavesI found the chicken tikka to be veering slightly on the sweet side as well.On the vegetables side, we had shiitake mushrooms in pureed spinach, flavoured with cumin and garlic and slow cooked black lentils, a speciality of the Northwest frontierAll these were mopped up with a choice of cumin and saffron rice and toasted almond/date naan.For desserts, we had a velvety dark chocolate mousse with a hint of cinnamon and orange zest and basmati rice simmered in milk flavoured with clovesAt the end of the dinner, I found the meal to be satisfying. The dishes were all made to be friendly and appeal without pushing the boundaries of the palate of the people I didn't get the spicy explosion that usually comes with Indian cuisine but it does hit all the basic elements.",

    "text": "In short, Tamarind was good, not great, and very overpriced. \u00a0Small entrees hovered around the \u00a320 mark, and the food was not delicious enough to warrant this price point.To be fair, Tamarind makes no pretensions at being an authentic hole-in-the-wall type of place and what they offer is meant to be high-end. \u00a0The atmosphere furthers this purpose - upon entering, a set of stairs takes you down to a glowing dining room with a high ceiling, with a sizable wait staff dressed in smart uniforms. \u00a0Service was attentive as well.The food was pretty decent for the most part, with a couple misses. \u00a0The complimentary crispy chips and the trio of accompanying chutneys was great. \u00a0Our table of four shared three appetizers, two kabab dishes, and three curries, along with sides of nan and rice and one dessert. \u00a0Of the appetizers, the palak-patta chaat (spiced chickpeas and whole wheat crisps with mint chutney, sweetened yogurt and tamarind chutney) was my favorite, followed by the spicy galaoti murgh (ground chicken with browned onions, mace, saffron and herbs with mint chutney). \u00a0The grilled scallops, flavored with peppercorns and drizzled with roasted peppers and crushed fenugreek in olive oil, were a little more cooked than I would've liked, especially at \u00a34 per scallop.The kababs were, on balance, very dull. \u00a0Tandoori chicken was dry and lacking in flavor. \u00a0The kabab selection (\u00a322 for four pieces of meat - the winner for biggest rip-off) came with monkfish, tiger prawn, corn fed chicken supreme, and lamb cutlet. \u00a0Of these four, the lamb cutlet was the only one worth remembering, though I'll admit that was quite good. \u00a0Curries were better. \u00a0Both the achari jhinga (tiger prawns tossed with cumin, onions, and tomatoes) and the chicken tikka with chunks of potato were very, very tasty. \u00a0I didn't like the kashmiri shank, which was labeled as a house specialty. \u00a0This was slow cooked lamb shank and it had more fat than flavor to offer. \u00a0The naan and braised rice with browned onions, cumin, and saffron were both good, but I've certainly had better for under \u00a33.95.The tandoori ananas dessert - a house specialty of grilled pineapple marinated with star anise, honey, and saffron, served with a scoop of rose petal ice cream and two blackberries with a drizzle of berry sauce - was a nice way to end the meal. \u00a0The pineapple was warm and tasty and the ice cream fragrant and lovely. \u00a0I'm not sure that their integration did a whole lot to elevate the separate components, but definitely solid. \u00a0After our meal we were given dark chocolate clusters with fruit and nuts as well as mint leaves coated in white chocolate. \u00a0These were welcome surprises.A special challenge faces proprietors of upscale ethnic establishments - people who know and enjoy their ethnic food can usually get it cheap and delicious elsewhere. \u00a0The challenge is not insurmountable - Hakkasan, another Michelin-starred restaurant we visited on this trip comes to mind - but I don't think that Tamarind successfully surmounted it. \u00a0That said, I had some good food here and the wine we ordered was better than what I might get at, say, an Indian lunch buffet in the States.",

    "text": "I always get worried when I have to go to an Indian restaurant. I think will this live up to my mother's cooking? The answer is usually no and Tamarind was a no.Four of us went for a friend's birthday and upon arrival we were asked for our coats and were sent down the dimly lit stairs which revealed the beautifully decorated restaurant. At the bottom of the hallway we were instantly greeted again and were escorted to our seats, where a waiter welcomed and introduced himself, even though most of the evening we had different waiters serving us.The menu was pretty limited from what I had expected but that to me meant that they were confident about the dishes they were serving. I had scallops for starters, the shank for mains, no desserts as we were not totally satisfied with what we had and for drinks I had a virgin colada, strawberry lassi, plenty of water and coca cola (I was the designated driver). They all came presented perfectly.The scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly but nothing else. I was waiting for a punch of spice or something that would have made the dish standout but nothing. I got to try my friend's Papdi Chaat, that was delicious, fresh and I could have happily ate a plate by myself. My virgin colada was nice but that was it. The shank was beautiful, cooked perfectly and the spices were bang on. I ordered naan which was the wrong thing to do but why did the waiter not stop me when I was making that error. He could have easily said I would recommend rice but we never got that from the waiter except would you like any dal tadka to go with that. Hmm... no dal tadka thank you but you could have recommended me rice for my shank. Anyway I still enjoyed the naan with my shank. My friend totally hated the biryani and she never complains about biryani but she said it lacked spice and flavour.The last thing I had was the strawberry lassi and what a disappointment that was. Hardly any flavour of the strawberries coming through which gave it more of a lassi taste rather than of the sweet strawberries described.We asked for the weighty bill which was accompanied with some lovely chocolates and off we were out of the restaurant, half full and half disappointed. Comparing Tamarind to Benares which is also an Indian Michelin Star restaurant, Benares wins outright.",

The Indian food at Tamarind is traditional West Indian food prepared in a tandoor oven; it is delicate, subtle, and expertly balanced with spice resulting in delicious unforgettable food. \u00a0Dining at Tamarind is a special experience that will transform your experience with Indian food and perhaps directly influence your thoughts about India's culture.Tamarind's atmosphere is warm and inviting; the service (run by Fernandes, a native of GOA) is impeccable, the head wine sommelier Reynald Felder is refreshingly knowledgable and passionate about wine and it's pairing with Indian food. \u00a0There are very few (if any) restaurants that we dine at where the sommelier knows as much as my husband does about wine or is as passionate as he is. \u00a0For wine lovers, the wine list at Tamarind is well assembled and balanced.To assist you with the menu you may want the assistance of Fernandes. \u00a0For our recent dinner we paired a delicious bottle of white burgandy (a Folatieres, Puligny Montrachet) .... \u00a0which has a light, smooth, and a seductive taste with a mixed appetizer from the kebab menu, including tikka prawn (our favorite); and the main course items of Lamb masala, Chicken tikka in tomatoe, potatoes and okra, and garlic naan.Tamarind is a fabulous restaurant that never disappoints.",

Walking inside Tamarind I love the beautiful well appointed and elegant decor that is sophisticated and luxurious, not stuffy.Tamarind's traditional Moghul cuisine allows you to try dishes that are cooked in their authentic tandoor style oven. I lost a bet the previous evening with my college roommate so I was buying dinner. I figured if I was paying we might as well try as much of the menu as possible. We started with Aloo Tikki, Grilled scallops, Kalonji Jhinga Tiger prawns with ginger, yoghurt, paprika,ground spices and toasted nigella seeds - Yum. For main courses we loved the Kadhai Gosht Lamb with peppers, onions, crushed coriander and cumin; The Chicken Tikka, and Tali Macchi fillet of sea bass.Needless to say we skipped the desserts, but were able to wash this 3 hour dinner down with some cold lagers. New York needs some better Indian cuisine, and a proper Tamarind is in order.",

We ordered the following:1) Papdi Chaat - Surprisingly light for a street food appetizer dish like this and full of flavor2) Lobster Masala - Lobster tail meat, surprisingly a good portion. For some reason, the sauce didn't do a whole lot for me but the meat was great.3) Murgh Makhani - You can't go wrong with this butter chicken dish. Excellent curry.4) Prawn with Coconut Curry (forgot the exact name for this curry) - Highly recommend this one. The curry was also very very VERY good.5) Plain naan of course which was good6) Kulfi (both pistachio and mango) - Surprisingly a bit let down by these BUT worth a shot. Maybe do the gulab jaman instead!With Indian food, I always do Old Fashioned cocktails as it pairs very well for me and I gotta say...they make an AWESOME Old Fashioned here.The space is great, service is class, and you walk away with a full stomach guaranteed.Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This place is excellent.Had a wonderful dinner here. Was in a party of three. We got the group menu (\u00a372 per person). Obviously that's not cheap, but the food was outstanding and the portions voluminous; we had quite a bit left over, and we were completely stuffed.What I liked about the food is that it wasn't over-engineered or anything. It was classic, hearty and delicious. I think the other set menu ('tasting menu') was more high-end and painstakingly presented, but the stuff we got was straightforward.There's an exhaustive wine list, but we just kept it to a couple rounds of Cobra (priced at a refreshing \u00a35 per bottle). Very pleasant ambiance, not too stuffy. Stellar service.Absolutely worth a visit if you like Indian food and are willing to pay up a bit for a special experience.",

    "text": "After hearing, for years, how great Tamarind is we finally had a chance to visit for dinner this past week. I'm sorry to write that this place is very overrated. Ambiance: Tamarind is a beautiful place. Clean, well-decorated, and located in Mayfair (where we usually stay). Note that this place isn't as formal as one would think, with people dressed in jeans and polo shirts. Service: Very lacking. While we were seated immediately (we had a reservation), we waited for a long time for someone to take our order. I finally had to flag someone down, which strikes me as very inappropriate for this type of restaurant.Food: Average all around. The seabass needed salt and was also too acidic. The bhindi was bland. The lamb biryani was so spicy my in-laws sent it back (and they never do that). The replacement biryani was just as spicy and thus didn't get eaten. The roti and daal seemed to be fine for my FIL (I didn't try either). My husband said the chicken was bland but at least the meat was good quality. The papadums and chutneys were fantastic!Prices: This restaurant is VERY expensive. Definitely not worth the inflated prices.Overall: I had a much better meal at Masala Zone on Monday of this week, at a fraction of the cost. The food was better there, the service was better there, and the ambiance was just as nice. I don't recommend Tamarind at all.",

A huge tiger prawn, chicken, monk fish and lamb chop. For our main we selected an array of dishes so we could sample \u00a0everything. They have a good cocktail selection and were more than happy to make a cocktail for me that was not on their list. The staff were very friendly and attentive.I will definetely be back and they do have a monthly competition where you can win a meal for 2 if you place your business card in the bowl.",

    "text": "My first introduction to Indian food was on a business trip here in 2002, when Tamarind was near the peak of its popularity and tables were hard to find. My Indian colleague had been there before and was very enthusiastic about what he felt was honest-to-goodness, traditional Indian food of the highest quality. Indeed, I was blown away by the heartiness and full flavors of the otherwise deceivingly small dishes, and I've been a fan of Indian food ever since.Fast forward to a more recent visit. While it's clear that Tamarind's aura has faded somewhat and tables are now much easier to find, you'd be hard-pressed to find a higher quality Indian experience, as long as you're willing to pay up for the location and the Michelin star. The portions are as small as ever, but still very filling without being overpoweringly heavy. The food, including the rogan josh (lamb) and malai tikka (chicken kebob) remains wholesome, fresh, and flavorful.It's a small, intimate, subterranean space in the heart of Mayfair and there's a windowed view into the kitchen. It remains a dependable place for a business dinner or a nice night out.",

My co-worker loves Indian food and was given Tamarind as a recommendation. It is a Michelin starred restaurant and is worthy of the rating.To get started I ordered the passion fruit martini and my co-worker ordered the rose petal martini. OMG delicious drinks! After taking a sip of the rose petal martini I knew that had to be my second drink. Both were expertly crafted. As for our meal we enjoyed: *Pudhina chops which featured lamb cutlets with dried mint, tomato & coriander chutney. Absolutely delicious with no one flavor too overpowering.*Tandoori grilled jumbo prawn with a mint sauce. Another excellent choice.*Chicken Tikka Masala. A staple dish in Indian cuisine featuring perfectly flavored chicken cooked with tomato, onion, and ginger with dried fenugreek leaves. My co-worker said this was the best chicken Tikka she ever had. I didn't have anything to compare it to but I couldn't imagine it tasting any better.We also enjoyed a side of roasted eggplant and seasoned rice. The rice was light and delicious. Not sure what flavors were in it but it complimented everything we ate. The roasted eggplant was not too soggy which can often times happen. \u00a0As for dessert we shared the Gulab Jamun which was cardamom flavored milk dumplings and hazelnut chantillie. It almost tasted like a warm doughnut. Really hard to pinpoint the flavor or texture but it was excellent.Service was fast and efficient. Our server wasn't overly attentive or friendly but was in no way rude. We enjoyed a pleasant conversation with the Sommelier who was quick to bring us our cocktails and make sure we were happy with our drink choices. Tamarind was a wonderful experience and I would enthusiastically recommend dining here.",

    "text": "I've been to Tamarind a couple times, and without a doubt it's one of my favorite place to eat in London. While the set lunch with 3 courses and sides for \u00a332 is an absolute steal, it's worth every penny to veer into the pricier a la carte menu. The tandoori grilled jumbo prawns are heavenly and perhaps one of the best things I've ever eaten. Even if you think you know Indian food, a visit to Tamarind will show you how Indian flavors can be elevated to a level you've never tasted before. While I was skeptical at first, Tamarind is very deserving of its Michelin star.Service is excellent, being both attentive and approachable. The dining room is very bright and airy despite being in a basement location. Wine service is excellent.",

This place has the best ambience and very good service. The food here is definitely topnotch with enough options to choose from for vegetarians. We ordered baigan curry, some paneer curry and avocado chutney( not guacamole but chutney). Food was delicious and the portions were just right. If you are looking for street side Indian food then this is NOT the place for you. I would recommend dishoom or tally joe for that matter.",

    "text": "We went to Tamarind while visiting London by a recommendation of a friend. My husband and i were celebrating our Anniversary and so we wanted somewhere special. Tamarind was a great choice. We both love Indian food so an Indian food restaurant was a must while in London!. The fact that is Michelin stared place was a big draw as well.The restaurant is located in the posh Mayfair district, and the restaurant itself is very elegant. The crowd is very elegant as well. The service was a little overwhelming as you have about 5 people waiting on you at all times, but it was a very nice dinner and the staff even remembered it was our Anniversary. Very nice touch!.The food, OMG, the food is amazing!. A medley of flavors, sauces and spices. Not for the faint of heart as Indian food is. Very authentic plates as well as some fusion ones.However all of it was delicious.The Maitre D suggested a very nice wine, we also tried some excellent cocktails suggested by out server and went with the Chef's Menu. Now in hindsight, this was way too much food, about 7 courses or so, but so delicious!. We tried a bit of everything: from lamb to masala to Tandori oven dishes. 5 star all the way!",

The sommelier came by with the wine list. We asked for his help in recommending a good wine to go with our choice of food and were not disappointed. For the starters, we had the Gilafi Reshmi and Grilled Scallops which were very good. These were followed by the mains of the Murgh Tikka Masala and the Hyderabadi Shank with sides of pilau rice and dark lentils. Both meat dishes were soft and well seasoned to the taste. All in all it was a good experience. The restaurant wasn't too noisy but still had a lovely atmosphere under the customers chatter.",

The desserts should not be missed, I had never really had much in the way of Indian desserts before, but these were stunning.",

The calamari in the seafood masala was overcooked. Having eaten in many michelin starred restaurants, I would suggest that this establishment no longer deserves this honour.",

The decor is oppulent-asian (with lots of gold, brass, strong materials etc), and nestled underground you feel miles away from the city above. Service is impeccable (the drinks trolley being a nice touch) and the food is, as you would expect, superb, and really celebrates (in my opinion) the diversity and elegance of proper indian cooking.",
