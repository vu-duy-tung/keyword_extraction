Either that of the menu was so blah that it turned my appetite into a thing of the past.I ordered the scallops because I love scallops but these were sadly waaaay too overdone and rubbery and there is nothing worse in the scallop world than a scallop you can bounce off the floor. I also tried the rocket salad, which I must say is a far cooler word for arugula than our American version, so that was worth something. As for a beverage I ordered a bottle of coke which was 2.25 pounds. That seems pretty high for a soda, but oh well. The decor also left me a bit cold. It just didn't have anything memorable going for it, which I guess gelled perfectly with the food. Would I come back here? Most likely not, but maybe you'll like it. Never know.",

The menu was appropriate, if a bit limited, and the main course (predictably, I went for the turkey with all the trimmings) was perfectly lovely. The best bit about it, though, was the \"Porn Star\" martinis (passion fruit) with a shot of champagne on the side. Excellent! Well, that and the fact that the Christmas crackers contained three-foot-long tube-shaped balloons which everyone was blowing up and releasing around the room. The atmosphere was friendly and enjoyably loud (ie: conversation rather than music); and the staff looked after us brilliantly. I understand from reading the reviews that ordinarily the Balans experience can be a bit mediocre, and while this wasn't blow-your-mind excellent, it was certainly very good value for money on Christmas day, and entirely convivial.",

Last time I went with a few friends ordering food was a mission in itself, first the waiter has to drag himself away from his mirror and then somewhat later you actually get noticed and ordering well that is something else. We ordered a simple two course meal and the main course arrived first and then the starter and what we ordered was very simple the waiter got us mixed up with another table and refused to budge on the matter, its simple a mad circus in there. The food is really nice and you get really good drinks, I personally like the cocktails. Brunch is much better as I love there Egg's Benedict and their salads. The location is awesome, right in the middle of old Compton Street, Soho. So really good if your out bar hopping from one bar to another or just a great place to meet up with mates. The prices are really good too, not that expensive.",

We were glared at for asking for a table of six (they had to put to tables together you see). Then we were ignored for ages. Once we got our order in, some more friends joined us. Ten minutes later they got their food. When we asked why we'd been waiting half an hour and they got served first, their explanation was that our friends were ' in a different department'. Then the waitress came over to tell us they had no crumpets left. But it took her half an hour. My eggs Benidict was cold. Our final latecomer didn't even get the menu he asked for so went hungry. It took me ten more minutes to get a glass of water. By which time we'd asked for the bill about four times. We didn't pay service, which they had the nerve to question. They also never apologised for being so incompetent. I'll never come back here. There are enough decent places to get breakfast in Soho. Including a place on the Wardour St/Old Compton St corner that does great bacon and egg sandwiches. I'll go there instead. I have to give Balans a star, but I don't want to. Grrrr I'm still annoyed by this place after a month.",

The menu is fine and the food is quite good. This is a decent late night venue - I hate the rush of bars closing at 11 and then having nowhere to go after to just relax - so this for me provides that space.

By early I mean that certain realm of time where you're only just stumbling out of the club at 5am while early morning commuters look at you with disdain. Yes, you will have to queue, yes it doesn't look like your typical breakfast cafe but there just aren't many places in central London that will give you a full English AND put up with your inebriated giggling when the sun is just coming up. Further down the road is the big Balans, this is where you should be lathering up pre-club. The food, I have to admit, is pretty mediocre. The cocktails on the other hand at a reasonable 5-8 quid a pop are pretty special. If you're going to drink on the gayest street in London may as well get some fabulous gay drinks too and these gays are excellent at cocktails. So if you've had a bad experience go back, have a frozen passionfruit daquiri and give it a second chance.",

We had a few Bellinis upon arrival, which were tasty and quick to be delivered.It's a nice little stop off for an early dinner and drink before heading out \u00a0into Soho. I'll be honest. I'd rather go to Lab a few doors down (now called Academy) or pop over to Cafe Boheme for some food. If someone asked me to meet them there, I'd go for a few, but if I had the choice, I'd rather go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Warning: there are TWO Balans on Old Compton Street. We waited for one another for 20 mins and then I realised there must be two. You have been warned. Secondly, Old Compton street is the most gay street in Soho. It is v gay friendly. You open a gay friendly place on this street and you will make money, irrespective of quality. That does not create a keen competitive environment to keep standards high. You have been warned. Balans gave me a very friendly welcome (I supposed I do look a bit gay with my shaven head). They gave a nice table in a shabby looking room. The menu looked great. The eggs benedict were the worst I ever had: Burned bacon, eggs full of water & over-cooked, Hollandaise with a crusty skin. The smoothie was moderate but over-priced. Not a great place, but then in retrospect, its not really there to serve good food.",

I don't really think it's all that pricey as a couple others have mentioned, but I don't tend to buy a lot of drinks because I go here to end the night . \u00a0Mains are between \u00a310- \u00a312 unless you order steak or something similar. \u00a0I also have never paid a cover to get in and wouldn't. \u00a0Maybe that happens much later, I don't know.We hit this place after the theatre or when we want to get food after going out for drinks.I have never been here for breakfast so cannot comment at all on that. \u00a0For me, Balans has been strictly late-ish night, but still dinner food.Note: This place is definitely not Italian. \u00a0I tried to re-categorize it but there's no \"eclectic\" tag. \u00a0The food ranges from Thai, \u00a0Mexican, and European to French and African. \u00a0I think it kind of fills the role that a diner would in the US, but it's not really a diner so much..",

Shizz, talk about taking the people for a ride!With club flashing lights and pumping music, the night never needs to end. Despite our inebriation, I can comment on the food. The hollandaise sauce on my eggs benedict was a bit over done, but you can't expect perfect from a chef working the 5am shift. My blueberry pancakes on the other hand were incredible.

I guess so.\" \u00a0He took the dish back to the kitchen, almost certainly spat on it, and wrapped the hunk of pork in tin foil and deposited it back on our table. \u00a0No bag, no container, just a tinfoil-wrapped slab of pork for my wife to carry around in her purse. \u00a0I guess.Yes, I know that taking leftovers to go is an American thing that isn't really done here. \u00a0But 1) I'm sure that we weren't the first Americans that Ludvigs ever waited on, and 2) You should never really throw up in your mouth in front of a customer. \u00a0Or at least try to be subtle about it.",

Seriously.Oh right, he forgot he wasn't at Starbuck's and actually working! \u00a0He was mostly fine though green and apathetic to our questions. \u00a0One friend asked the waiter if the sea bass or lamb shoulder is better. \u00a0Reply \"One is lamb, is fish.\" \u00a0Only on more prompting, did he say the flavoring on lamb was tastier. \u00a0He uttered a similar response when I asked about the pork belly or the wild mushroom pasta. \u00a0\"It's pasta.\" \u00a0The food itself was decent. \u00a0I had chicken liver salad with a poached egg (this was not really poached, more like almost hard-boiled) and it was standard. \u00a0My pork belly was seared so there was little fat left, but the meat still tender. \u00a0The sea bass was decent (not awesome). \u00a0The calamari was funny in there there were 4 pieces. \u00a0Yes, 4 for , \u00a36. \u00a0While the dishes were mostly executed well, I thought the seasonings could have been more bold. \u00a0Prices were reasonable and dinner was about \u00a0\u00a325/person with wine and shared starters.The funniest part to our fun waiter experience came at the end. \u00a0I hardly touched my pork belly (which was actually pretty sizeable) and asked to have it taken away. \u00a0The waiter looked like he was ready to heave and conceded, \u00a0but not happily. \u00a0 I know wrapping leftovers is an American vestige, but you don't have to look like you're about to throw up in my food.Oh and the music is too loud, subpar trance music. \u00a0Mmm, goes so well with pork belly and conversation with friends.Ok food, but I'm sure there are better places in the area as well as places where the waiters aren't reading the newspaper.",

The latter, sadly, did not involve alcohol so I was able to glean how good the food it.To start we had the calimari (decent), the duck spring rolls (avoid), chicken pot stickers (under-overwhelming), bread basket (best starter) and some olives (standard). Its nice that they have a variety. They are definitely sacrificing quality for diversity so be aware. If you are going to eat head straight for the mains.For my main meal, I ordered the prawn green curry with noodles. The prawns, like the noodles, were a little overcooked thus giving them a very rubbery texture. Yum (read: not)! Since, I wasn't impressed I was really holding out for dessert: Cheese Cake!Creamy. Cheesy. Delicious. Even though I ate enough for 3 people and a small child I still made room for dessert.",

It just means you're going to order a lot more you can eat :)The food itself could have been better - for example I did not like the seafood Jambalaya, though my friend swears by it. They do have nice calamari rings and scalops. And as far as I can recall on my post-birthday dinner/breakfast (at 3am!) I had a nice fish & chips.Do be aware that they stop serving alcohol at 3am...which is such a shame - majority of the clubs close at 3am and sometimes you just want to have that one drink - but it's not a reason not to give full 4 starts to the place.The place itself is clean in addition to all other its merits and as I said before - staff is nice and very patient.I love it - I love the atmosphere, kind of buzzy middle-of-the-night oasis of life - while soaked in alcohol Soho closes its eyes for the rest of the night.",

Slightly annoyed as have been informed today the table we're about to sit for our meal need to be vacated by 8.30. Now we have always been told Balans do NOT book tables so what is this about? Aparently regulares (which it looks like we are not even though we eat there once a week sometimes) can book tables! Feeling a bit insulted... I wonder if all the regulars are \"Men\"? Not good at all. Food still top quality, a bit loud at times but we enjoy the music and busy environment.",

Loud bumpin' vibe so the party doesn't have to stop. Feels like you're back in the club. Lots of people watching and ambiguously sexual patrons and waiters. Food is a solid 3. Drinks are a 2. Had to send back my all sugar and syrup martini. It was disgusting. Wine tasted like 2 buck chuck. All in all, they fed us when we needed to be fed.

They are open till 5am with alcoholic beverages available until 3am - only thing is, they ask for a \u00a32.50 cover charge per person. Price per head is about \u00a325 including a drink. The location is in the heart of Soho a little way down Old Compton Street. Vibrant atmosphere, good friendly service and British International food to die for! The decor is funky, modern and fresh. You almost feel like your in a trendy bar on the set of 'Sex and The City'. While you tuck into your tasty late night meal and get slozzled on Whisky sours, there is background music of old and new house, which is always appreciated. This is a great place to come before a night out or after! This is a popular branch but they also have others in Chiswick, Earls Court, Westfield and Kensington. I recommend the venison sausage and buttered garlic mash or the three egg omelette with spinach, salmon and sauteed potatoes! Nom nom!!! A great little gem in the buzzing area of Soho!",

The espresso was damn good (they suck in the U.S.) I had ordered the big breakfast because I had a 14 hour flight ahead of me. It came with large pieces of bacon that was good (had to cut out a bunch of fat though). Sausage, toast, potatos,scrambled eggs, tomato, and mushrooms. Pretty good but nothing outstanding.

The sauce, as others have commented, was a little acidic, but at 2 am who cares... It was a bit loud inside, but not nearly as loud as a club or bar would've been.

I tried mixed berry pancakes for a late breakfast on a weekday. Staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant was not very busy and the service was pretty quick. I went for mixed berry pancakes. The pancakes were good. They were fluffy like they should be. But they were a little too sweet as they were soaked with syrup. I much prefer to have syrup (and butter) separately so I can control how much stuff I add as I make my way through the stack of pancakes. I always enjoy eating the plain pancakes first before adding syrup. I have never been here in the evening but apparently they open till late.",

The new interiors are awful. May be they attract suburban yummy mummies but they are not the sexy gay environment they used to be.",

A table in the sun on the street watching the colorful soho crowd, excellent. 5 stars. The prices are on the high side ie \u00a39 for two poached eggs on a \"muffin\" with a slice of salmon. \u00a0Which gets me to my order. The Eggs Benedict. \u00a0Poached eggs on salmon and a toasted muffin with hollandaise sauce. \u00a0The basic dish. \u00a0So it arrives. No dressings or frills or sides just the two dressed eggs. \u00a0The muffin is not a muffin but more like a white roll. So the outside of it is lightly toasted but what ends up being the meal is, you're eating your eggs on white untoasted bread. Not good. Then the hollandaise sauce on top of the eggs is cold. So your whole meal is now on the cold side. \u00a0It must be said that the poached eggs are made to perfection but with cold sauce on the top and a fluffy bread base, it's ruined. \u00a0The salmon is very salty. And the Americano coffee is too strong. \u00a0So I guess, go there for the location, just be careful and specific when you order.",

    "text": "Racially Profiled My First Night in London, how exciting! Goes without saying I was excited for my first evening in London when we found this bar/restaurant. The place was full for the most part, with a few unbussed tables in front and some empty tables I could see in the back. There was however no hostess to indicate if it was seat yourself service or wait to be seated. After a awkwardly waiting by the entrance with no sign of an employee working the door, I decided to walk over to a server terminal where I saw someone putting in an order, to request a table. I asked if we could be seated, and the man (later told me his name was Victor) asked how many. I told him 2 and gestured towards my sister still standing by the door. He looked over, then replied there would be about a 30 minute wait, to which I said OK that's fine, could you add us to the list please. He said well, we stop serving alcohol at quarter past 12, so you wouldn't be able to get anything to drink after then. I was surprised by how early bars closed here, and asked if he had the current time, to see if we would still be able to have at least 1 cocktail after the wait. He said it was 11:45, meaning we would be seated after drink service. Convenient. I pointed out that there were a few empty tables, and would it be possible to just sit for a drink before last call to which he again insisted there was a wait list and suggested we leave and try somewhere else.I looked around and realized there was no one else standing or waiting around the door or restaurant waiting for a seat. So I asked him, where are the other patrons on your wait list, certainly you could start seating some now. He said they were no longer at the restaurant but he was sticking to the wait list and wouldn't be able to seat us. At this point, I started realizing what was going on. And started asking if he had a contact number for his phantom wait list party, were they aware tables were open, was it possible they may have gone somewhere else, was he truly going to deny service to us to which he replied\"I am\". Besides the fact that we were denied seating in a bar with several open seats, the nonchalant manner with which I was dismissed (responding to my questions in brief, curt phrases, not even looking at me when we spoke), it was so rude. I asked if there was a manager, which he said he was. 2 black females walk into a bar. The End. Because racism. Disgusting!",

We were seated in one of the large circular booths at the back of the restaurant which was spacious and quite private. The menu is nice and reasonably priced for Central London. I wasn't keen on my scallop starter - they were almost under-cooked and a little watery but it didn't matter to me as I was having a rare old time knocking back the Prosseco and a very well made mojito! The main course was delicious I have to say, I had the bavette and it was really very good! Everyone at our table enjoyed their main meals - the desserts were fantastic also!

    "text": "I just read through some of the last reviews and I think summed up it just confirms what my problem with Balans is...in that I don't know what my problem is...I just know that I have one. I was thinking it was the menu - it's such a hotch potch of dishes and cuisines you can't really see a theme, but then that's not a big problem is it? So,maybe it was the food itself...my starter of scallops with a caulliflower puree was really nice but then our calamari seemed like that frozen stuff. Or mains were a bit more of a miss. Seafood jambalaya needed a bit more flavour. My swordfish was ok, but again I think a frozen steak and the blackbean rice wasn't seasoned or cooked long enough. BUT, again, if you look at the prices, what were we really expecting? Ok, maybe the service? No, our waiter was really friendly and smiley and even knew that my friend always had extra toast when she goes in! Decor? hmm..more shadow lounge than restaurant but so what. In conclusion...if you want somewhere cheap and very cheerful right in the heart of Soho that's open until sunrise'o'clock than this is the place....but keep your expectations at the door!",
