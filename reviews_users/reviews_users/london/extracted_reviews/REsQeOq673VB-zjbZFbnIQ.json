You convinced me, you wise yelp-using folk.First off, I was *supposed* to come to dinner here with Andrew M., Nava N. and Grant T., so their reviews give a great idea of what inspired me to bring a friend here one day when we were bumming about the Shoreditch/Hoxton area. I said, Hungry? He said, Burgers? I said, Let me Yelp.... MEAT MISSION!He still says it's the best burger he's had in London.I haven't had a ton, but it was a great burger!We started with the currywurst, because I'm a sucker for it, and by the time our burgers arrived, I was nearly full. However, our burgers were delicious. Toasted buns, piled with toppings, and so big I couldn't fit my mouth around it. I have a big mouth.... So that says something!All of our food was great. We had a good view, and had the chance to try some of their wide range of international beers (yay USA beer!!). We even got to go in the photo booth and make silly faces to take as a souvenir from our time.In total, a great experience. Definitely a highlight, tucked away on Hoxton Square (but absolutely worth the walk!!). Must do, if you're a burger person in London.",

The gravy chips are sinfully good and I always order the deep fried pickles. Be prepared to do lot of exercise to work this off after! But this Meatmission in comparison to their other branches is nice and gothic. Built on an old church I think which is nicely apt for the name.",

    "text": "Really, this should be a three star review. Saved by the Monkey Fingers.What are Monkey Fingers, you ask? Think fried chicken breast fingers, dredged in a vinegary-tangy buffalo sauce. Those are good. Utterly unhealthy and delicious.The decor is very Shoreditch and uber cool, though the clientele, perhaps not surprisingly, was distinctly more City. I also like that they take reservations. Nobody likes to queue outside in the cold, hence my reason for never trying Meatliquor. My burger was incredibly average though, sadly. I had the Green Chilli Burger, and I am generally not much of a spice wuss, but it was way too hot for me. Probably a problem with different spicinesses of individual chillies, but wowzer. The meat was a bit dry and had no flavour. If you really craving a good burger, my favourite thus far as been Honest Burger, but there you have that whole waiting/no booking issue. I had a single bite of my friend's Dead Hippie, and that was much better than mine. I'll try it again, perhaps I just ordered incorrectly.",

The burgers are good too but I've always found them to have too much black pepper. The last time I had the hippie fries the caramelized onions tasted old and tinny. It seems the quality of the food prep is going a bit downhill. The beer selection is great though and staff are friendly. A good casual place to meet hipster friends. \u00a0Three stars for the burger. Four stars for the wings, location and value for money.",

The dead hippie fries were OK, a bit heavy on the mayo for my american tastes, but they were cooked to a nice crispness and the ingredients were top notch and full of flavor. A nice beer selection, even with a few American Craft beers to boot. The large communal table in the center makes this a great place for groups, though be prepared to talk loudly, as the music is booming.",

    "text": "I was on a mission. A mission for meat. And MEATmission was definitely the place to go.Now it's not named MEATmission for that reason. It's in an awesomely converted old Mission. However, it should be named because of that. It really should.So I'm starting out with the statement that I've wanted to try MEATliquor for ages. However, they don't take reservations and every time I've gone by the queue has been stupid. And I'm not British, so I don't believe that queues will make things better. MEATmission (part of the family of MEATliquor, MEATmarket and MEATwagon) takes reservations(!) so I asked a few Yelp friends to join. Unfortunately, I tried to book for a Wednesday night on the previous Friday and it was already completely booked. (Now, the bookings are only for one of the dining rooms in the restaurant, the other is first come first serve, remember that!) I had nothing else to do, and I really wanted to try it, so we agreed to queue and get there about 6:45ish so we could get in around 7:30ish or so. So as I'm getting off the train at around 6:45ish (due to my train being late), I get this text saying that there was no queue and they already had a table! SCORE! I get there around 7 (because I'm an idiot and walked too far), and the place has people, but it's not full to the gills. So +1 to MEATmission for lack of a long queue! However, has the night progressed, it definitely filled up and by 8:00 there were quite a few people at the bar waiting. Suckers! Get there earlier!The four of us went a bit crazy. We ordered a few starters. Chicken wings, fried pickles (yes, deep fried American-style pickles. I've had them before, and was really excited about getting them) and the roast beef garbage plate. The garbage plate is similar to the Canadian delicacy poutine (fries, gravy and cheese) with the addition of roast beef, horseradish and onions. They were all fantastic. Even the non-meaty pickles. Erica fell in love with them at first bite. The wings were tasty but nothing that made them stand out from other buffalo wings. Get the garbage plate. It may sound gross and look a bit gross, but it is SO GOOD. I was dipping my fingers in the gravy with the fries. Sticky hands, but with the lack of cutlery, I didn't care. Chips and horseradish may be my new favorite combination.So we decide to get some mains next. I wanted to try the dirty hippie burger, but I was concerned that it wouldn't be as good as something else. So Andrew decided to order an extra one and split it four ways so we could all try. Genius. Andrw and I had the green chili cheeseburger, Erica had the chili dog and Nava ordered the pastrami dog. We also got an extra order of chips on the side and another order of fried pickles (they were that good). They were awesome. I lived in New Mexico for nine years, and they throw New Mexico green chili on everything. Burgers, fries and whatever else you can imagine. Now in no way did this compare to the green chili there, but it was DAMN close. I was in heaven. I tried some of the chili dog as well, which was also quite tasty and served with mustard on top (just the way I like them). The pastrami dog was fantastic. A hotdog wrapped in pastrami and fried? Then covered with sauerkraut? It was meaty and heavenly.They didn't have any dessert the night we went. Which was good, because we would have ordered it. But by the time I got home, I was in a meat coma. It was amazing.One of the best burger places in London by far. It may beat out Honest Burgers in terms of burger deliciousness, but the chips and price at Honest Burgers are still second to none. I will be back. And I will try more meaty goodness. (I'm even tempted by the challenges. But a chili dog, chili burger and chili fries in TEN minutes? Seems impossible. The chicken one seems slightly better. Two different chicken burgers and chicken wings in ten minutes. Maybe. We'll see.)",

Burger and fries are always decent, but not amazing. The service is what really let us down. We were basically ignored and had to flag our waitress down for everything, then she got our order wrong as we'd asked for dead hippie fries but received regular. You'd think this is a quick swap, but the correct fries took so long we'd all but finished by the the time they arrived. Oh, and the waitress made it seem like our fault, instead of just apologising- massive faux pas in my book!!\u00a350 for a couple burgers with unimpressive drinks and terrible service? No, just no.",

The bar gets seriously busy, as do the tables so plan your times right as you can't book. My friend and I arrived at 5 for a late lunch and it wasn't busy but after an hour went by, it was heaving with people. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and fried pickles. The burger was so juicy and thick, the bun was a sweet brioche and the filling was packed tight. My only criticism was the bacon didn't exactly look like bacon. It was a salty piece of compressed meat that unfortunately ruined the burger for me. I don't want to complain because everything else was sehr lecker! And fried pickles? Mmm yummy.I would recommend this place if you're in need for a good burger and a beer. Service isn't that great, they all seem to be in their own world but they're young after all!",

    "text": "Burger bars seem to be popping up everywhere in London, and to be honest, I've typically found something more appealing than a burger when out for dinner. You may wonder why I'd go to a burger bar? Well, I was given the task of find a place that would appeal to a wide range of tastes, was a bit different to our usual choices, was affordable, and could serve a mean cocktail. I also wanted to steer clear of Covent Garden and show friends a bit of East London.I settled on Meat Mission since it appeared to tick these boxes. I'm very happy I did.The most surprising thing was how affordable Meat Mission is. Around \u00a38 for a burger in a trendy spot seems unbelievable to me. I pay more than that in a run of the mill pub these days. I decided to have the red chili cheeseburger and gobbled it right down. Other friends opted for bacon cheeseburgers and dirty chicken burgers. All but one of the group liked the food (the exception finding it too greasy for her tastes). The chicken burger did fall apart as often happens, but my chili seems to help bind it together (which could go some way to explaining my quick progress).The cocktails were also very tasty. I wish I could tell you which ones I opted for, but their names escape me. They were both fruity berry options though. My main regret is not ordering the dead hippie. Yes, It would have been a struggle to finish it, but the sauce we had with the hippie chix was delicious and I regretted not having another way to taste it. I'd definitely go again.",

I look up into the (fake) stained glass windows and join the congregation in a celebration of meat.And I loved loved loved the dead hippie burger at Meatliquor, but I hated the service. Meat mission actually has much better service- there are queues but man, the wait staff is way more chilled and the bar is so much easier to get to than its sister restaurant. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try the dead hippie this time because I was still full from a lunch buffet earlier! So I went for wings and the hippie fries. But I have to say, the hippie sauce wasn't as good.The wings were amazing. The wings are always amazing. perfectly cooked, spicy, and cooled once dipped in glorious blue cheese sauce. I'm drooling. DROOLING. It's a bit hard to find- it's off hoxton square, look \u00a0for the meat sign. a big great neon meat sign, leading the way to eternal meatiness and bask in meat (sweats.)",

It was a solid burger but not special. Likewise the wings- pretty good for London but won't make me come back again and again. The drinks, when they had the ingredients, were quite good.

When you enter inside you feel like beeing in a nightclub, loud misic, lot of people going in and out.This trendy place is busy, so I would recommend to book your table. Otherwhise expect to wait more than 30 minutes on weekends. If it is the case, why not enjoying a drink at the bar ?The menu offers everything you wish to taste in the US. I tried the chicken wings, the fries and the cheeseburger. The quality is right, great value for the price. I even was thinking it is too cheap!Tasty food, served in large quantity. It is pretty dark inside and you cannot really see what you are eating :)It was hard to talk with others and to be listened, this is a really noisy place..",

It's in a former mission, hence the name, and you sit on some rickety pews that are not all that comfortable. The major positives are that this is the only place in the chain that takes reservations; they have a great bar by the entrance should you arrive early or have to wait; and the sharing cocktails are so fun (we drank out of a porcelain bowl that was in the shape of a face!) And it's right in the heart of Hoxton so definitely go heavy on the drinks then hit a few bars in the area.",

There are Chilli Challenges, which you can try.So this is more like a burger place which serves great choice of drinks also. I had a Red Chilli cheese burger. It was really good. Juicy and amazing with a little bit of spiciness. Loved it. I didn't go for anything else like fries as I thought it would be too heavy. The burger wasn't as big as I expected but it was filling though. I chose a drink that I had never tried before that day. It is called Bitter and Twisted. And just as the name suggested it was bitter towards the beginning and the taste got twisted into something sweet as you gulped it. It was like a mix of beer and ale. There was a sort of milkshake I wanted to try, but thinking about the fact that I had to go back to work and code again, I avoided it. The heavy lunch would put me to sleep for sure. This was a team lunch, with my coworkers. So we all had a variety of stuff. I'm pretty sure if you are a meat lover you will love this place. There is also one vegetarian option. Halloumi and Mushrooms! Neither my co-workers nor I was interested in checking that out. So you can share your review of that item with me when you try it. I totally recommend going here.",

Or just MISSION as their front door sign reads, is almost an exclusive restaurant as their regulars get the booths and first timers are relegated to sitting on the benches in the center of the room. Going with a small group I really enjoyed their beer jugs and was quite amused by the decor. However the burgers aren't overly impressive and pretty pricey despite the dressings. Their Hippy Fries stood out. But when the check arrived I wasn't happy with the surcharges.. Ok ok take my %10 service charge, that's compulsory Id never refuse to tip to a decent waiter but another quid for a \"voluntary donation\" huh?

Fries, gravy, cheese, onions AND crispy onions, roast beef and horseradish cream? \u00a0Lawd. \u00a0We also had the fried pickles which are devine, and the wings, which were serviceable, to start. \u00a0For my main, I got the Pastrami Dog. \u00a0Man, oh man. \u00a0It was a bun. \u00a0Then melted cheese and pastrami on bottom, smoked pork dog, russian dressing, and a healthy portion of kraut on top. \u00a0I don't think I can come to Meat Mission and not order that again because it was so damn tasty. \u00a0As Grant mentioned, we split the Dead Hippie four ways, and I was far more impressed with it than its ugly fraternal twin I had at Meat Liquor.While it was almost empty when I walked in, we left at almost 9 and business was booming, so bear that in mind when planning your visit. \u00a0I'll be back. \u00a0For sure. \u00a0Maybe I'll even drag my veggie cousin as they had a mushroom and halloumi sandwich on the menu!",

    "text": "Oh, how many ways can I praise Yianni Papoutsis for kicking off the burger revolution here in London. When MEATwagon went brick and mortar and opened MEATliquor with Scott Collins, it quickly amassed a passionate and hungry legion of carnivores. If you've ever strolled into Marylebone from Bond Street Station, you may have seen enormous queues day after day since November 2011. Thankfully, MEATmarket followed and now MEATMission. Each of these places is an assault on the tastebuds and senses in the best possible way. Not sure if it's a converted church, but it might be, and fitting for this cathedral of the burger and its equally tasty supporting cast of side dishes and cocktails. As my Yelp buddy Shevin Tantula said, it's rare to find a place in London with a great American-style burger that also does excellent versions of bar classics like buffalo wings and chili fries. Oh my God, the chili fries. Unlike many I've tried in London, each element of the chili fries (fries, chili, mozzarella or cheddar--need to check on this--and tex-mex style jalape\u00f1os) melds together to form a perfectly cohesive and extremely satisfactory explosion of flavor. They are addictive. And then there are the burgers, as close to the American diner burger as can be, only outdone (slightly so) by the Bleecker Street Burger truck. I thought I had tried them all, even the elusive Black Palace at MEATmarket in Covent Garden (won't find that beast here, but try the Dead Hippie). But on my last visit after the kick-ass Yelp \"When Gin Met Tonic\" event, I discovered the green and red chili burgers on the menu, which I would have tried if I hadn't stuffed myself with the addictive buffalo tenders and chili fries. Next time, Gadget. And there surely will be a next time.",

However, neither bad points as the decor was interesting and definitely had me scanning around soaking in the cool surroundings. And my bad for not seeing the entrance correctly, looking back it was glaringly obvious. Sat at the bar for 10 minutes before a table became available, we didn't book. Bar tender took a bit long to take my order which was slightly annoying but they were very busy with what looked like a huge order of cocktails.Once seated for food the menu had my mouth watering immediately. Not an overwhelming choice, which I prefer, but everything I expected and more. I was tempted to try the chill challenge but the waiter informed me I had to finish it in 10 minutes. I wanted to enjoy my first visit here so declined.I went with one of the specials, Dead Hippie burger with a bunch of toppings, the bacon took special note being beautifully crispy and smoked. There was also cheese, two patties and pretty good hamburger sauce amongst some other tasty fillings. The burger wasn't too stacked despite the description, so I was impressed when it arrived and didn't look like a handful to deal with.Shared the wings and special fries with caramelised onions with my guest. Now I've definitely had better wings (Bodeans), they were fine and not bad by any means, but expected more. But the fries were sensational with the onions and mustardy sauce that accompanied them, 100% recommended!Portion sizes were perfect, I didn't try my guests burger but she raved about it too. Sadly desert offerings were nowhere to be found, which really is a shame as a mountain of hot brownies covered in ice cream would have been perfect.Drinks offerings were standard enough, pleanty of choice but nothing stand out. I would recommend getting the pitchers of beer as they're good value for your buck.Out waiter was also a gent and had a good bit of chat about him which is always a bonus and all too rare in London.Overall a great experience that just lived up to my very high expectations of the place. Loses a star for no dessert offerings and mediocre wings. But still an absolute pleasure and can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Our group of ten were meeting at this restaurant for a baby shower meal. We arrived there happy to see each other and hungry! A couple of us were delayed on the tube so were running a bit late. We were met by a very unfriendly and rude member of staff who continued being rude throughout the whole time. When booking the table we were told that we had two hours. Which we totally understood. She rushed us through ordering rather aggressively. We quickly ordered as could see she was clearly in a hurry to get us fed and out of there. I was 25 minutes late for the meal and when I apologised and tried to order a drink, the waitress grunted and acted like it was a major hardship for her. So I ended up sharing my friends drink. Once the food came we ate quickly and she came back and started picking trays up that weren't even finished!!!! We didn't even have time to tell her that we hadn't finished. To be honest she should have seen that there was still food on the trays and asked us before running away with them!Half an hour before our booking was up she returned to the table \u00a0with the card machine. We asked if we could order a bottle of champagne (we would have been sharing this so probably would have only had a small glass each which would have gone down quick). The waitress rolled her eyes and said \"where do you think you are going to drink that? Your table is nearly finished and we don't have a bar where you can stand and drink this\". We were so shocked by her response we decide that we would take our business somewhere else as there was no point arguing with her. But she continued to huff and puff. we asked her what the issue was as we still had 25 minutes left now. She advised that she needed to get us out and clear the table for the next people by 8pm!!!!!!!! We were all absolutely shocked at her attitude. She turned a fun happy occasion Into a miserable one. We asked her to take off the service charge from the bill as she had been so disgusting and she rolled her eyes and snatched the receipt to take the payment.Needless to say that non of our party of ten (most of who work around the area) will not be returning. This was the worst customer service we have ever experienced. Totally ruined our night.Shame as the food was pretty good. I had the protein style HippyBurger. Cooked perfectly and very tasty.",

The veggie option is a halloumi burger which is pretty nice even for us non-veggies... \u00a0 The only issue is the queuing it can get rather busy and no matter what the wait is, they'll always quote you 20 minutes, but you can go round the corner for a quick drink and wait. \u00a0They also do \"Doggy Bags\" for all the food you order and don't eat... which is usually a lot.",

    "text": "So, somehow I suggested Meat Mission for lunch with my dear colleague Alex. Somehow, in that...I thought this was even going to have a relatively healthy option!? Think again, and absolutely not. Then again, who comes to Meat Mission (or any other of the locales under this meaty umbrella) expecting health food? I'm guessing literally, no one. So, that one's on me...and I'll take the meaty lumps as they may. MAKE A RESERVATION, even for lunch. This place, though seemingly inconspicuous lodged between Hoxton Square and Pitfield Street, is attracting large crowds on the regular. Late lunch (130pm) on Friday, barely a seat open in the house. You've been warned, make a reservation. Easy to do so online. Our table was not great, right next to the kitchen and we felt a bit in the way, so if you can try to snag one against a wall, I'd vote for that next time. ITS DARK. AND LOUD. Even in the middle of the day, you could not call this place \"low key.\" It's dark, loud. ITS UNHEALTHY: Things like \"garbage plates\" exist. Bread bowls. There is not one thing you could order that isn't deep friend, slapped between buttery buns or dripping in gravy and cheese. Sweet, sinful indulgences. THEY ARE NICE: they are. The service was good and everyone was smiling even though they don't see the sunlight! I did end up with the Dead Hippie burger (minus bun, a la deconstruction) which is amazing. Two mustard fried patties with cheese, onions, special sauces and pickles. It's for real. Even without the bun it was pretty rock solid and tasty. Do yourself a favor and come here when you've got the space to indulge, obviously. I didn't try the cocktails, but with quite an extensive list and a penchant for the ones on offer at Meat Liquor, I'd have to say they are a safe bet. They did charge me double for a soda. I caught it too late and seemed petty, but just watch your bill...as they are a new outfit and perhaps there may be an error. Will definitely be back, far preferable to Byron (blech) --- nice to have one of these in the area. BURGERS! DEAD HIPPIES!",

    "text": "MEATMission, the latest edition of the MEAT family, puts its siblings to shame. The Mission part comes from the fact that it's set up in a converted Spanish mission and they've really focused on that with an epic stained glass ceiling and the fact the lit up sign outside only says \"Mission\". It took me a minute of staring at the sign to decide it must be the right place as the dark, almost blacked out windows don't give anything away. Once inside, I spotted Nava at a booth and in short order we were relaxing and staring around in wide-eyed wonder. The rest of our MEAT crew soon showed up and were quickly followed by a 3 pint jug (I'm talking a glass jug in the shape of those stereotypical moonshine bottles - the ones with the XX on them). I believe we chose the Brooklyn Lager which was light, a touch sweet, and a good helping of hops - all in all it was a perfect accompaniment to our varied food choices. After perusing the menu and having some debate over what starters to get, we decided to do the grown up thing and order all of them (or would the grown up thing be to actually make a decision?). This came to buffalo wings, fried pickles, and an epic garbage plate. The wings were good and kudos for properly serving them with celery and blue cheese dressing, but they could have used some more heat. The fried pickles weren't my thing but made Erica swoon so they must have something going for them.Stealing the show was the garbage plate which tastes pretty much the opposite of how it sounds. Think of it as the American version of a poutine with crunchy fries, saut\u00e9ed and crunchy oninons, slices of roast beef, and horseradish cream all covered in a meaty beef gravy. And I mean properly doused, not just drizzled for appearance. Apart from the heart attack I had with every other bite, it was pure heaven and I could eat that any time.For the burger, I stuck with my green chilli burger (a cheeseburger covered in chopped jalapenos) but in an effort to keep an open mind (and break in our MEAT virgins), we also got a Dead Hippie to share. Now, as you may recall from my MEATMarket review, I thought the Dead Hippie burger tasted exactly like its namesake would likely taste, so I wasn't fan. The MEATMission version however was so much better and may have made a fan out of me. I love the slightly pungent taste of the mustard fried patties and the sauce makes it an interesting flavour combination of meaty, tangy, and a bit acidic (in a good way). The green chilli still wins but I no longer hate the Dead Hippie (but only at MEATMission).The atmosphere is also more pleasing and manages to have character without deafening you (I'm thinking of you MEATLiquor). The servers are pretty damn friendly and don't mind when you make a mess. As a side note, although they say you can book, there is only one large table open for reservations. So even if they tell you there are no reservations available, 90% of the place is up for walk in. Do make sure to get in early though as by 8pm there was a considerable line.Overall, MEATMission brought me back to the MEAT family, and for that I thank it.",

    "text": "Dear God, what is this pain? Oh right, yes, a visit to Meat Mission. The newly opened hell-child of the MEAT family (Wagon, Liquor, Market), it's roared into existence and overnight popularity in what used to be The Real Greek in Hoxton Market. A former Christian mission, this ain't sacred no more. Skulls and crossbones, saucy cocktails and plate after plate of diet destroying meat is served up. Though the way the tables in the middle are served canteen-style to grungey hipsters, it has a touch of that Christian homeless food shelter still about it. We sidled in, managed to secure a seat the bar and a table (early adopter bird gets the worm) but it was still heaving with people. I ordered The Tipped Velvet, which is apparently 1950s slang for women who like women. A lot of the drinks seem to come in some whimsical fashion, served in a mask or a plastic jar thing. I was there for the food though and it does not disappoint, if you're looking for a greasy, satisfying heart attack. One order of deep fried pickles, the signature Dead Hippie burger and the 'roast beef garbage plate' which is kind of like poutine, fries, roast beef, cheese, sour cream and a jug of gravy to pour over it. \u00a0I am dying of food. This does \u00a0have a lot more options that Meat Liquor so i can see it being more successful. It has a lot more sandwich options, like a beef dip, pastrami, and the plates. The venue is very cool, with touches of Hells Angels style from Meat Liquor mixed with the original Christian features, stained glass windows, memorial plaques.",

    "text": "Slipping away from the Magaluf like strip where the heathens of Hoxton Square hang out, Hoxton 'Market' is however a more subdued, cobbled causeway away from the crazy. However, bless my soul, on entering Meat Mission you'll find a den just as sacrilegious. Think the theme of Madonna's like a virgin video with skulls and barnyard owls on a impressive stained glass effect ceiling! Cosy looking booths cling to the edges where patrons are lubricated into wipe down scalloped seating, with the sheer amount of oil in the atmosphere easing eaters in to their troughs, sorry tables. Our party had a biblically long bench in the centre of the Mission Hall. God help you hear in the DJ'd din, but sitting down trying to concentrate on a cocktail list 5 pages long, I have to commend my Burgerette for her saintly patience and *the most expensive* recommendations. Turning to the back page for the solids, the sustenance, where I was hoping I'd find -the food menu. I wondered if I'd missed the main menu? If perhaps this list at the back was just the bar snacks. Nope, that was it; Burgers Burgers Burgers. Looking around, confounded by a surreal haze of burgers; sloppy stacks with green dripping off appeared to my left, across the hall a pile of precariously laid out burgers with yellow goop projected over them were slammed down opposite, then a stack of burgers with unidentifiable sauces groaning out of them were slip sliding out of it's captors hands and down his front to my right. Despite these frightful sights, I tried to contemplate the menu. But I panicked, nothing seemed worthy or the slightest bit appealing. I was anxious, my forehead was glistening, not with beads of sweat, but the anointment from the oily atmosphere coating my clothes and vision. I felt queasy in a Fear and Loathing type way, music was blaring, I feared what was going on around me and I was just loathing it. Bountiful streams of kitchen roll cascaded around me, waitresses with more trays waded past. I'd like to proclaim, I was looking forward to meat, it was my mission that night to meet and greet some meat. But are burgers and wings really classifiable as 'Meat' for someone on a mission? Where were the baby back ribs? The steaks? Contempt, annulled my appetite. However I didn't want to appear the pariah, or be the one who in protest orders a salad. Who'd in a place like this order a salad for fear of being curs-ed and escorted out. Realising my glow of sanctimonious unease, I priggishly ordered deep fried pickles dipped in blue cheese. Our food arrived on trays, wet handfuls of burgers with flimsy buns dissolving were dispatched around the table, not on plates but on Plentiful paper towels. Then communion of fries were passed along the congregation the same. My pickles had to be picked up in a tissued hand and placed in front of me, much like how a toddler in a high chair is served. Although many enjoyed the festivities and the novelty of dining, returning to such regression, I felt a tots tantrum brewing for the want of the use of a fork.As not to sacrifice the enjoyment of my evening, I continued communion with the Sangiovese to calm my infernal delirium for which I give an offering of one star.By the end of our congregations meal seating, most faces were aglow with not greasy satiation but the light with which we were checking our phones. During the terrible dinners Din we'd become hoarse and contemplative silence fell when conversation was maddeningly hopeless.Feeling the need to be cleansed of this experience, I with the remaining powers of Regina invested, put a pillowy setting of tissues down and prayed. \"Thank you, Food Gods for what I have had. The Cocktail list was splendid. Also please bless all the terrified aged parents who's feckless fully grown children suggest taking them to dinner here\". I'd only come here again for drinks alone, but feel I have now done my life's pilgrimage to the Mission. For all those new that descend into these doors from the broadcast radio's loud call to prayer, a small space for when the spirit of dancing fills the Mass wouldn't go amiss.",

The venue it's self is very unique in the way the ceiling is light up with interesting pieces of colourful art. The seating plan is slightly odd as they sit you right next to people who u don't know from Adam. Other than that the atmosphere is nice and chilled although this place will normally be packed after 6pm. THE FOOD....all in all the food was brilliant, big portions and for a good price. They serve wings to start which are \u00a36 and something pence. I ordered a portion thinking I might get about 6-8 wings but no I go a total of 12 wings. This is a trend for most of the starters so I would suggest sharing as 6 wings or strips are plenty per person. The mains are a mix of burgers hotdogs and pulled pork sandwiches. I had a double burger cooked in mustard which was lovely and by the end of the night I was stuffed and could barely move. A good tip is to order 1 portion of chips between 2 as they are also XXL lol. I never had room for dessert but the peanut butter and chocolate sundae seemed like it could be a winner. All in all a really good restaurant that won't let you down.

    "text": "Out of all of the Meat Liquor branches around London, this one in Hoxton is one of the best. I love love love it! The food here is such a great price as I know full well that other restaurants charge \u00a33-\u00a35 for food that is not as good as the food they dish up in Meat Mission.Their signature Dead Hippie Sauce is delicious, a yummy mayonnaise rendition, and their fried chicken in their chicken burgers is so crispy and the chicken breast is so meaty and you know it's not full of water or bits of chicken you'd rather not be eating!Their chilli cheese fries were also very impressive! The chilli meat on top was full of flavour with tomatoes, and the cheese on top with jalapenos was such a great mixture of delicious tastes.The venue is unique too with great surroundings and friendly and helpful staff.Overall, I highly highly recommend eating here in the Meat Mission in Hoxton. Go for it!",

    "text": "Fantastic burgers. But loses a star for raw onion on the cheese fries. They really love raw onion, it's on almost every dish, and their menu warns you it's there so you can ask to skip it, but I didn't spot \"onion\" on the cheese fries menu entry, that's an unexpected horror that ruined it. And it loses another star because at this price you should use free range / organic / animal welfare kinda meat and they don't.",

In fact I directly credit that one burger to making me realise that I don't want everything well done!But I've been to Meatliquor and have been disappointed - the service there is pants and it's so dark that we didn't notice one time that they brought us the wrong burger till the first bite.So, with trepidation we went to the Mission. First off - the interior. Massive improvement co paired to liquor, there's more than two lightbulbs! The ceiling is frankly amazing and I think it's brilliant how they've kept the original features.Now the food. I had a dead hippie. I first had one back at the pop up Meateasy, and I can vividly remember the taste - it's never been as good since. But half of the burger I got at the mission was so perfectly seasoned as to remind me for the first time of that amazing burger. On that single note this is five stars alone.Very happy with the mission. Now it's my mission to return - goodbye Meatliquor, I've run off with your sister!",

So when we were in scoffing distance of Meat Mission, I had to go and try it.And I'm glad I did! We were there around 4.30pm on a Sunday. I thought it would be empty - but in fact, there was only one booth remaining when we got there, and the place was lively. And while the decor was pretty similar to MeatLiquor, someone had the genius idea to install a few lightbulbs. It was nice to be able to see both my dining companion and my food. How novel! I didn't like the bench seating, as the dude next to me was a wiggler, and was funny about me moving the bench out so I could get in without climbing over it (I'm as graceful as an ox), but once we were settled and I got used to feeling like I was on a boat, I was golden.The food was similar to the other Meats, tasty but a little underseasoned (come on, guys, stop being scared of salt and pepper, or put some on the table!) and I hate the stupid metal tray. But it was overall a tasty burger, with good service in a trendy place that wasn't too trendy to make me feel dumb, and I left pretty happy.",

All finished off by another server dropping off our bill saying \"we close in five minutes,\" rushing us to pay, adding a 10% service fee to our bill.

The staff were busy but seemed as if they have no real idea what was going on. We had booked a table, but still had to wait. Seems that booking makes no difference as all the tables were full and we simply had to wait till a table came free. There was no real personality to the service and despite asking if the bingo wings were spicy, were told they weren't despite a friend being unable to eat spicy stuff. A flat out lie. Nor did the inability to get the bill after 3 requests impress either. This said however, it was down to the food to represent. And represent they did.We ordered bingo wings and monkey fingers for our sides. Essentially buffalo wings and turkey drummer style, they were nothing special, but the quantities were good.. Eating on a converted church or missionary, it's quite a surreal place. It almost felt like I was in an episode of sister act, expecting somebody to break out in song at any time. If there is a church of hipster, it would be located here.The mains are where it's at though. The buffalo chicken burger is packed to overfilling with blue cheese, deep fried chicken, lettuce and onions wasn't the tastiest I've ever had, but it was the largest and messiest. If you can't be the best, be the biggest and messiest.To me, that's a signal of intent.",

(and quite cheap as well)And what about the FOOD? I have no words...one of my top five places to have the best burgers in London. Delicious, mouthwatering and...NO WORDS! The sides are good: the fries are not a big deal, but they have some kind of spicy chicken wings with blue cheese dressing, OMG! Seriously. TO DIE FOR.Last but not least. THE DECORATION. Rock and roll and Purgatory get well together. What can I say? It's my kind of place. Everyone is chilling, no worries, good food and a lot of beer!You can find me there almost every week :)",

I accuse myself of the following gluttonous acts.We donned our flannel shirts, thick-rimmed wayfarers, and ironic 90s tees and ventured into Shoreditch/Hoxton for Meat Mission, where the patties were as juicy as the decor was blasphemous.We booked a booth ahead of time, which I recommend since this place gets busy at dinner time. The restaurant is a converted convent supposedly, and is decked out with all manner of religious artifacts from stained glass windows to confessional booths to Illuminati symbology painted on the ceiling. Meat Mission boasts an impressive range of craft brews on tap and a rather aggressive cocktail list.After gorging ourselves on wings (HIGHLY recommended) we got down to business. One friend ordered the gravy fries and some complicated bougie burger, and the rest of us mostly got cheeseburgers. \u00a0The meat came perfectly cooked - a thin layer of brown on all sides, with a fleshy pink center. The fries (not chips) were okay, they were a bit plain and under-salted, so I resorted to my normal gastronomic intervention of smothering them in ketchup and mayo. They bring your food to your table on big trays, and the burgers seemed to be arranged randomly so you get to clamber over each other to get to yours.We washed it all down with a couple of pints of beer. Heads up - they only serve tap beers in 2/3 pint, 2 pint, and 3 pint containers. So you're basically either sampling or you're downright committing. All the more reason to bring friends!",

This place will be our (Meat) Mission! Meat Mission is nearby Hoxton Square and you can recognize the words Meat or Mission in red letters. I was glad that I had booked a table, because this place is very popular! It is located in an old church and the walls and ceiling are decorated with cool art! The atmosphere is very cool and relax and the people are a mix of hipsters, business peeps and down-to-earth peeps. Staff is friendly and quick.I have food allergies and it can be a challenge when you are allergic to both milk and soy. Forgive me, Father! I need to check this place out and YOLO! We ordered the Garbage Plate, Chili Fries and The Dead Hippie. The food was excellent but maybe too much. My stomach was a garbage and I was almost a Dead Hippie but hey, I know worse places and food;-)! I don't like the food. Noo, I LOVE the food! Especially The Garbage Plate with fries, meat, gravy, onions, cheese, and so on was dangerously good! The Dead Hipster hamburger and the Chili Fries were also good. This version of Chili Fries had a different taste and the USA versions. This one had more meat and is a bit spicy. You pay between \u00a36 and \u00a310 per dish but the portions are really huge. That is not expensive!My fiance and I decided to go to this awesome place every week...oh wait..we are living in Amsterdam and there is no Meat Mission here, boohoo! I should have a Meat Mission to open a second restaurant in Amsterdam;-). In the meanwhile I'll be back at Meat Mission in London...soon!",

The music can be a tad bit loud for some looking for a quiet evening but not for me :)The service is great - lots of quick, proper attention.We went in on Wednesday evening and had to wait for a few minutes to be seated but it was quite full for a weeknight. Weekends can be quite difficult - with a long waiting period so better to plan well.And now let's talk about the finger licking burgers!!we had the bacon cheeseburger and red chili burger and they were both delicious!! The size is good, the patty is moist and the bread is fresh. We also tried the hippie fries - French fries loaded with fried onions and mayo based tangy hippie sauce.So. All in all. I'm definitely going back here for my burger & fries times!",

    "text": "Meat Mission is definitely a one of a kind place. A converted mission (although you might struggle to find much evidence of this) with huge, vivid graphic murals and illuminated ceilings.Not too trendy hipster, despite being in the centre of Hoxton, the ambience is relaxed and social, everyone is in it together; seated side by side on somewhat cosy bench seats and cheering on their fellow diners who dare to attempt the Triple Chilli Challenge.The food is very reasonably priced, so you don't feel too put out that it arrives on a tray which you share with your fellow diners. Who needs plates anyway? The chicken wings, chilli fries and chicken burger were all gorgeously saucetastic. There is a similarity to the food you might get at Hard Rock Cafe, but not as pricey.Bear in mind that this is a very loud bar/restaurant, and you may have to hop over other patrons in order to get in and out of your seat. Probably not the place to take your elderly uncle, but a great place to meet friends and have a laugh. I certainly enjoyed myself! I fully intend to go back and attempt the somewhat dangerous cocktail list at some point too...",

    "text": "When you walk in you're immediately hit by the dimly-lit, cool vibe of the place. There's a massive mural on the ceiling and plenty of interesting ornaments on the wall related to the local area. As would be expected from Shoreditch, it has an extremely trendy feel - I think it's the first time I've ever seen a manned DJ podium controlling the music being played. Fortunately, the food is as good as the decor, the menu has some great, interesting dishes and it's hard to choose just one. Ended up going for the chicken strips to begin, which were perfect. Deep fried and battered, covered in hot pepper sauce with a delicious blue cheese dip. Between 3 of us we shared one portion of chips, and this was more than enough to go around. The burgers themselves were also filling, meaty affairs. I went for the chicken buffalo burger, which had tasty, well cooked chicken bursting from the bun. This had a blue cheese dressing, which again was delicious. Managed to nab a bite of my girlfriends 'Dead Hippie' burger, and this tasted pretty fantastic too. The drinks choice is excellent, for the beer lover there are many choices - from Brooklyn IPAs to german Weiss Beers. These come in 3/4 of a pint, or in pitchers ranging from 2-4 pints. Tried a couple of these and they went down very well. Also had a sip of the Tea infused gin cocktail that someone else had, and that was pretty damn good also. Only downside is the lack of plates or knives and forks. Definitely not a place for a first date as you WILL get messy - which is why they provide a whole roll of kitchen roll per table. Whilst I'm not afraid to get stuck in, when you've got a beard it is fairly tricky to avoid a face covered in burger sauce - so I did end up using a copious amount of kitchen roll. But, all part of the experience!Tldr; well worth it, but not on a first date ;)Prices are faaaairly decent too, spent about \u00a325 each for a starter, burger each and quite a few drinks.",

The burger supposedly had a thin bacon patty, but it honestly looked unappetizing and was so crispy that it didn't even taste like bacon. I had high expectations for the milkshake because I've heard good things about the shakes here. It tasted delicious, but it was super weak and tasted of no alcohol. My friend got the chicken parm burger which she liked. Overall just an okay, loud place. Probably won't be going again.",

The food was greasy, dry and over cooked - quite the achievement. We waited half an hour for it, and it arrived looking and tasting as if it had been sat under a heat lamp for a half of that time.

I'm not sure it's quite as good as it used to be and they've certainly expanded aggressively all over London, but it's always a solid option.I've tried most of the menu and I can vouch for the slaw and the onion rings. Both are very good, perhaps the slaw wins. I also recently tried the chicken wings which were good- although I always thing messing up wings should be a crime.Other than that, you can't go wrong with the dirty hippy or the dirty chicken burger.I did however hear from one of my dining companions that the deep fried mac and cheese wasn't that great and that the sauce they put with it was a weird combination, so maybe stay away from that side!",

Found out on our way over that it's a hamburger joint, I thought oh my 1st meal in London will be a hamburger but after the cocktail a burger sounded great!After a fast 2 minute walk we were inside the Meat Mission, now the door on the outside is dark and just says MEAT on it, I would have walked by on my own not knowing what waiting for me inside.Meat Mission is AMAZING!! Mind Blowing, when you 1st walk in your eyes take in soo much, from the stained glass ceiling, to the paintings on the wall, to the bar in the center of the place to the hunky hostess working his mostest (yep that's a word, I typed it LOL and he had the cutest dimples ever, would love to have taken him home, but sadly I wasn't leaving for the states anytime soon so I left him be haha) This place ROCKS! We had about a 30 minute wait before we could get seat so we made our way to the bar, I cant even recall the name of the drink I ordered but it came in a martin glass, tasted like that lemon/lime fizz candy used to eat as a kid, it was soo good and refreshing, couldn't tell it was a drink, I'm sure that lil fella could get me in trouble haha.Got our table and it was time to look over the menu, by the way, the menu itself a work of art, totally going to the Church of Burger and about to get our praise on! AMEN Bring me the beef! Before I tell yall what I ordered, I was told by \"they\" that food in the UK is bland, no flavor, NO HEAT, so I was prepared to be without spice for a few days, but when I saw on the menu they had a Green Chili Cheeseburger, I thought I died and went to heaven, oh wait I am in the Church of Beef, so they must have heard my prayers from abroad to make sure some things pack some heat!The green chili cheeseburger was a great beefy patty, cheese, red onions, pickles, lettuce, mustard, catsup and chili butter, I wasn't sure what chili butter was but I though eh why not, the burger came out and it looked amazing! I think the hamburger gods were smiling on me because this chili butter holy damn that stuff is AMAZBALLS!!! So damn good! This was hands down one of the best burgers I have had in a while, Yes Meat Mission I am here to praise you!! Had great company, great food, so glad to have stopped by this place!",

    "text": "I'd been hearing about this place for months, so I was pretty excited to go for a burger before a gig at Hoxton Square last night. I loved the interior -- so quirky and cozy. We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away, even though the place was definitely busy.Despite it being in a church, it wasn't exactly the religious experience I was hoping for. Our server was really sweet, the cocktail was delicious and the atmosphere was great. Plates might've been nice, but whatever. I would've given 5 stars if one or both of the things below didn't happen:1. Don't get the Green Chilli Burger unless you like your esophagus immediately ablaze and a 3am rummage for Rennies. Look, I am from Southern California -- I know spicy. I put the hottest hot sauce on everything. Spicy is a way of life and usually, I laugh in the face of UK \"spicy\", so when the menu read \"spicy chilli butter\", I said \"LET'S DO THIS.\"But what they don't tell you is it's not Spicy GREEN chilli butter, it's spicy RED chilli butter and it was HOTTER THAN SATAN'S TAINT. Yes, there were luscious piles of green chillis on top, but those are the mildest chillis on the planet. If you call it a Green Chilli Burger, then say it has chilli butter on it, the assumption is that it's green chilli butter. It caused me physical pain. My tongue went numb, my lips were on fire, my throat was searing and I only had one bite. Given that everything in the UK that's spicy is usually quite mild, a little flame or star or \"Hey bitch, you've been warned!\" on the menu would've been nice.2. \u00a0I don't usually gripe about dissatisfied meals to servers in London, especially in Shoreditch, because I'd been told where to shove an especially fatty porkchop once, but our server was nice and my burger was basically inedible. I sweetly asked our server after having only one bite, if I could swap it for something else because nobody warned me it would be that hot. To his credit, he asked management if he could take it off my bill, but was told no. So if I wanted something else, it would come out of my own pocket.I don't mean to be That American here, but c'mon. It would've cost them a couple pounds at *most* to replace the burger and make me a happy, meat-munching customer, prepared to leave a 5-star review, but instead, he brought me a new top bun (not even a whole new bun) and I had to scrape off every single thing on the burger into a paper towel, so I was left with no cheese, no condiments, nothing. Just a burger. Which was still saturated with spicy chilli butter. I ate it because I had to pay for it, but I physically regretted it and left feeling resentful. The burger itself was cooked well and had it not been like eating the Sun, I would've been really happy with the food.My girlfriend got the Dead Hippie which was delicious and seemed modeled after the infamous Double Double Animal Style of In-n-Out in the States, so you can't go wrong there. The cheese fries were really good, though I would've preferred grilled onions or something -- raw was a bit harsh.One tiny clarification on the menu could help future customers from feeling the burn, so to speak. Our server was ace, but management should've conceded here. I wasn't ranting, I wasn't a jerk, I couldn't have been sweeter about it -- I'm not saying the customer is always right, but a little concession here and there won't break the bank.Overall, I'd go again and get something else, but the poor customer service left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I visited during lunch time and the place was empty, but that didn't stop me from admiring the decor of the place--which was a former church or shelter. The jalape\u00f1o burger had the right amount of spice and it was super tasty. I recommend coming in for lunch as they offer a free beverage during early hours.",

It was very busy and lots of people around but great atmosphere! The waitress gave us 2 complimentary shots for a mix up, which was really lovely. Food was good, the same as meat liquor but all delicious. My dirty chicken burger was huge and meat wasn't dry at all. I will definitely be going back again, it's a great place to take someone who is new to london or just visiting as well!",

I've had the Dead Hippie several times and can attest that it's still the best burger in the city! Modeled after In-And-Out's Double Double Animal Style, this is just an amazingly simple burger. They get everything right. From the bun and lettuce to the onions and secret sauce. And of course that juicy and charred patty. The chili fries, buffalo wings, onion wings, all of it is anywhere from solid good to amazing. You really can't go wrong but always coming back to that Dead Hippie.",

    "text": "Yet another burger, well a holy burger in this case!MeatMission looks like one of the fashionist, they-tried-too-much-to-be-fancy shoreditch's kind of place.Well it actually is, but proper food and good beers make me willing to come again, even waiting half an hour at the bar at 22:30 on a friday night!The interior is reminding of a church (I actually know the place was an actual church, but don't take my words as granted) but it's not too pushing in that direction... It's kind of cool actually, they could have done much worse! beer is served in glass or (more properly) in jars you can spill it by yourself, and I love the idea! I like to have the sharing jar of beer, and because of the number of good beers they have this is a reason why I'll get back here again! Food is served on big trays, directly on paper cloths (yes, even the chicken nuggets were directly on the cloth!). In conclusion, not a place for your parents.But the food is actually good, almost really good, the monkey fingers were nicely hot but without being hurting and the burger (as many suggested, go for the dead hippies the first time!) was deliciously rare They get straight to the top 3 of my burger top spots, without even asking for directions! Good job meat mission!",

Fries would have been good but for the heart stopping amount of salt - 30 minutes on and lips still burning.Daughter dropped a glass of water on the floor so I wiped it up using their paper towels - they were literally black after a quick wipe. Absolutely filthy.Plus draft beer sold in 2/3 pints - I don't need a fraction of a beer.",

Fried mac&cheese sticks were the best I've tried. Vanilla malt milkshake was malty and lovely but I felt not the highest quality of ice-cream had been used. Service was good except for 1 guy who was arguing with me about their reservation policy I had gone through myself and he was telling me things which weren't true. For the record, no reservations past 6.45pm. Monday evening was quiet enough for walk-ins though. His attitude, the small milkshake and the like warm chips mean I won't be back.",

    "text": "First of all, burger gets 4.5 stars. \u00a0It's damn close to a 5, but let down by a slight under-cheesing on the cheeseburger. \u00a0Other than that it takes the prize for best burger I've had as an American living in the UK for nearly 14 years. \u00a0From top to bottom it's a really tasty burger, with the highlight being the meat. \u00a0It's nicely seasoned, well formed (not too tight) and well cooked. \u00a0Pretty close to a Shake Shack burger, but MM is better as it's got no faux-piped in grease (read the NYT profile of SS's owner from about 18 months ago). \u00a0The fries get 5 stars. \u00a0They're absolutely delish. \u00a0There are two reasons for MM getting 4 stars overall, ie a rating below its food: \u00a0First, the beer policy. \u00a0Who the hell serves 2/3rd pints but charges full pint prices? \u00a0We're talking 6 quid+ a full pint! \u00a0I won't have beers with dinner on principle alone. \u00a0Second is a weird combination of aggressive and airheaded service. \u00a0Aggressive is seating a group of three at stools facing a wall with a pillar between two of the stools, when you have a half empty dining room. \u00a0You can pleasantly offer us a reserved table if we're comfortable that we've only got an hour (and BTW, what are the odds that a family of 3 with a 9 year old take MORE than an hour? \u00a0none). \u00a0Ditzy in that we had to do the usual chasing of underexperienced wait staff. \u00a0We'll be back though. \u00a0Again, and again, and again. \u00a0We just won't drink beer!Final comment for management: \u00a0The credit card machines don't have an input for gratuity (which to MM's credit is not automatically added). \u00a0You're killing your waitstaff! \u00a0How many people overlook this and forget to tip? \u00a0We did during our first meal here. \u00a0The waitstaff should rise like the dead memorialized in the artwork and demand a change.",

I don't know how I feel about this. It's not that I'm religious in the slightest, but it made me a bit sad for some reason, whether it be the decor or what, I'm not sure. \u00a0At least the place doesn't pretend to be anything other than a grimy, filthy, hedonistic slopfest, sauces oozing suggestively out of a greasy, stuffed, overflowing tower of sin, not onto any sort of china or crockery whatsoever but, shockingly, directly onto a tray. \u00a0I'm pretty sure that's some kind of sin, as is coveting your neighbours' food as it is delivered to them. \u00a0Either way, my mother would disapprove.Don't get me wrong, I love a good slopfest. \u00a0However, I didn't particularly enjoy this one. \u00a0The burgers themselves are alright, but they're pretty unmemorable. \u00a0As I was eating my Dead Hippie (RIP), all I could think about was how it was a glorified Big Mac, the only difference was that the burger was bigger than those teasing, food porn-fluffed photographs plastered on the menu boards in McDonalds. \u00a0I have no problem with glorified Big Macs (there are some great street food ones), but somehow this let me down a bit, whether it's because I felt that it was trying to be something else or what, I dunno. \u00a0Secondly, the place just doesn't feel FUN to me (and let's face it, a slopfest has to be fun)...maybe it's because I'd had the pleasure of having a textbook slop experience at Lucky Chip not too long a time before coming here, but I just didn't feel any charm. \u00a0I never felt my face light up, or my eyes slave driving the acid production in my stomach. \u00a0As for the other bits, I've noted in my brain that the chips are not bad (couldn't tell you more than that) and that the Monkey Fingers are pretty addictive and come in a monster-sized portion. \u00a0From my experience, I'd say they're more likely to have originated from an orangutan - the colour being commensurate with the that of the tangy buffalo-esque sauce.Overall, I wouldn't object to going again, but at the same time...eh. \u00a0It's not horrendously expensive. \u00a0It's a decent burger. \u00a0Maybe it's just a function of the hype machine, maybe not. \u00a0Either way, don't listen to it.",

    "text": "If I was feeling particularly pretentious (what moi) I'd talk about being there in New Cross and just how hip and cool I was. \u00a0MEATeasy may be long gone, instead we now have 4? MEAT**** restaurants serving variants on the theme of meat and stuff arranged in delicious combinations. \u00a0 The latest of these is MEATmission in Hoxton, a quite little corner behind the Holiday Inn.If we considered this small chain to be a family, then Meat Mission would be the art school dropout brother. Living in a squat in Haggerson he wears skinny jeans and a fedora, smokes roll-ups and has a 24 inch waist. He would also probably be angling for a job here....On a Wednesday night the tables were crowded with the cool young things of Shorditch and Hoxton sitting at booths and benches surrounded by the 'saints and sinners' theme assisted by the atmosphere and features of this former Mission. The haircuts and fashion on display is almost worth the entry alone, but lets talk about the food.The Dead hippy I've eaten before (see above) and it's fab, the Monkey Fingers were new to me and proved to be an orgasmicly good chicken and chilli/pepper sauce combo - served dumped straight on a metal tray, because anyone eating here is too cool for fripperies like plates. \u00a0 The Garbage Plate however as suggested by the name, did actually come on a plate. \u00a0I almost have no words for this combination of a vast pile of fries, meat, gravy, onion, horseradish cream and cheese. \u00a0It was dirty and I liked it. \u00a0I pride myself on having a healthy, well trained appetite but this nearly brought me to my knees. \u00a0Its big, its sloppy and my lord is it good. \u00a0I ate so much food I could barely breath in, never mind walk. \u00a0Washed down with a couple of reasonable(if not particularly exciting) cocktails the meal probably shortened my lifespan slightly but I don't really care. \u00a0 My recommendation, is eat there soon, eat there with friends, eat as much as you can physically fit inside you. \u00a0You'll never be able to capture the MEATeasy experience but this is probably the closest you can get.",
