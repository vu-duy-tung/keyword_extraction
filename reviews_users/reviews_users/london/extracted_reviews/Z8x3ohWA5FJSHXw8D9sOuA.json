The doorstaff are proffesional, helpful and in some cases excessivly friendly! It makes getting to your seat a smooth and stress-free experience. The bars and food counters are large and numerous, its still the usual concert burgers and beers though, think it would really add to the experience to be able to buy drinks that arent available at all Wetherspoons. The Stadium is huge which can be a good or bad thing, if you are standing and can get sort of middle to front then the view is great! However if you get seats somewhere at the top near the back then you can't see anything cause you are simply too far away, video screens are usually a good solution for this but they seem somewhat of a rarity at the gigs I've seen here, not sure if it the bands fault or the stadiums fault, but they need to get them now!",

    "text": "Where do I start with the O2 well best to say I just love it I suppose. I have now been there more times than I can remember for concerts, festivals and free days out. First off the auditorium for the shows is out of this world, it's so large but it's easy to see the stars on stage even from the back. The accoustics are great and the staff are very helpful and friendly. There is plenty of disabled areas and a carer gets in free for all concerts and shows and sometimes the disabled area is right next to the stage. There is tons and tons of parking with lots of disabled parking close to the entrances. The fees for parking can be a little steep but they are always half price with a blue badge. Now onto what else there is at the O2 apart from just the arena itself. There is the Indigo room which holds private small functions for around 250 people, they have things like Dylan Moran, Madness etc it's all very up close and personal and adults only. There are many many eateries in the O2 however be warned they are all very expensive and there's not a lot of choice for vegetarians. There is a state of the art cinema inside the O2 which is very grandiose and seats thousands, I think they have around 11 screens. My only real bug bear with the O2 and the reason I haven't given it 5 stars is the fact it's so dam cold all the time, there's no heating at all except in the eateries so if you're going along there make sure you dress warm. Thumbs up.",

Plenty of restaurants to choose from, the food isn't cheap but where is in London?

Book car park before you go( very expensive) and get there early as que to car park is rediculous. (Best to park couple of tube stations away and go by tube), There is a food and beverage mobile cabin outside the venue which is decent & has cheapest food and drink. Inside, an oasis drink is \u00a33.00 double the cabin price and the food portions are tiny and triple high street price so if your starving eat at the cabin its cheaper. Note if you bring a bottle of drink when you go in security will take your lid (probably coz we were going to a concert). Also as you walk in the main entrance of the 02 there is an American style restaurant (one of many) on the immediate left (cant remember the name) dont bother, poor service, they got the order completely wrong and it was COLD (others were complaining too) and not worth the price. So be warned. There are many bars and reasturants as you go in to the alley on the right hand side. But all are very expensive. The arena itself is smaller than what i expected. The chairs are basic and space for leg room is tiny. So if you arent 'petite standard' under 5'3 (making reference to shop clothes size), expect to sit sideways or legs wide open, very unconfortable.Bring a long sleeve top as the the air con can get pretty cold. Staff are friendly and crowd control was good.",

    "text": "The O2 is a real story of a phoenix rising from the ashes. I can't really comment first hand about this venue when it was born originally as the Millennium Dome. Fairly or unfairly, it got a bad press and its reputation never really recovered though I had friends who did make multiple visits there.The site stayed in limbo after the millennium until it was gloriously transformed into the O2 Arena. It is now probably the leading music venue in the country.I made my first visit here only recently for the Strictly Come Dancing roadshow and was mightily impressed. It is an enormous structure but has an impressive Tube station to cope with the crowds. There were a lot of stewards too to help marshall people into sensible streams of flow, which really helped.The main \u00a0auditorium was huge and we were lucky to have good seats. The higher seats are quite far away and apparently very steeply banked according to friends who have sat up there. However, the seats are a good size and I was quite comfortable for the 3 hour show.The acoustics were great and this is attracting many artists to shift allegiances from other venues.Besides the main performance area, there is a big cinema and multiple exhibitions going on. It's a complete entertainment venue. At peak times, the main walkways can get busy as people browse the restaurants but there is a good range of food options from Brazilian BBQs to Chinese buffets.Sadly, although venues like Wembley Arena have nostalgia and history, the O2 Arena is the future. One last tip is that O2 customers get priority on bookings for events held here.",

    "text": "I think it was a universal notion shared by many astounded Londoners that a significant amount of money and good space was wasted on account of The Millennium Dome. Created in 2000, it was initially used as hub for 'The Millennium Experience'; an exhibition divided into 14 zones, illustrating multiple sectors of the human life. The project, however, failed to attract the number of visitors anticipated and was consequently shut down. In 2007, however, after undergoing a re-development, the Millennium Dome was reintroduced to the public as 'The O2'. Since then, I must admit that it has evolved into becoming one of the many hotspots of London life. The O2, I think, is the home of the largest entertainment plazas that London has on offer - one of its main attractions being 'The O2 Arena' that has accommodated for the likes of The Rolling Stones, Kylie, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Prince and Take That to name but a few. With an assortment of restaurants [some of the very best in town] alongside bars and clubs and of course the most current and riveting exhibitions - The O2 is definitely worth the visit. Easy tube access, with the nearest station being North Greenwich, The O2 is open until the early hours of the morning on most days to accommodate for your entertainment desires! If you're done exploring the wonders of the internal, then take a stroll under the stars along the Thames for a romantic end to a hectic evening. It can, however, get a little chilly so do bring a big, strong man to keep you warm - or in my case, a cashmere M&S cardigan!",

    "text": "The only reason this venue doesn't get 5 stars is because the queues for lining up for the food restaurants are just ridiculous! Think about it; you got matter - 2,600 capacity, a small intimate concert hall (O2 indigo - capacity 2,400), cinema, concert arena for 20,000 and shops! 21 restaurants with seating for about 100 in each at is best is whack! = 25,000 people possibly at any one time in the arena, so for the amount of people that are in this venue at one time there ain't enough food restaurants! What more could you want in one place, but the food queueing for any event here is just too long! What they need to do, is expand on the food courts, they got enough space to do it! Apart from that, everything else is fantastic, well worth the years of wait for them to do something constructive with the millennium site. I'm glad it has come to be what it is today! Countless good events in a local area! p.s. the car park is officially a ripoff at upto \u00a325 an hour! oh and the capacity 2,500!",

I was lucky enough to attend several of the Prince concerts staged in the concert arena during 2007 and I have to say not one seat gave me a bad view. Every time I had a clear view of the action, plenty of room to move and there was no problems with the sound. Having a central stage (in the round) is a big bonus and something that has been lacking from UK concert venues for too long. The venue is very organised and even with all the cinema goers, clubbers and concert goers - it all seems to run like clock work. The concert venue is very well located in the centre of the 02 and there are plenty of concessions and facilities available. I cannot rate the 02 highly enough ( and that's without gushing about the after show party I attended at Indigo 2 ;0)",

    "text": "The O2 is a cool place to hang out if you enjoy the feeling of living in an Orwellian-esque land. I find the place rather terryfying. We went to see Chris Rock last night in the arena, at a record breaking (for attendance) comedy gig. Half the gig was quite good, the rest was essentially a list of offensive cliches about the differences between men and women, black people and white people, black women and white men and so on ad infinitem. The venue itself felt to me like a sort of sociological experiment. 15,000 people in one room watching one person seems in practicality to be wrong to me. For a band, it might be less weird. We were on the 4th level, at the back. The view was completely unobstructed and we could see almost the entire venue. But again this just reinforced the panoptic 1984 feeling. From the balconies on the 4th floor you can see the tops of all the restaurants on the ground floor (of which there weren't enough to accomodate all the people who were in the O2 last night). Being able to see the tops of the cafes, makes it look like a fake town. Like Sim City 2000. Of course the Millenium Dome (as I will insist on calling it) is an impressive building, mostly in terms of its collosal size. It is quite exciting when you first enter it, but I couldn't shake the feeling of not really being in a 'real' place. Of course, the fact that there are seemingly only chain restaurants in the buidling doesn't help get rid of that corporate sense. I think when the robots have taken over they will enjoy the Millenium Dome.",

It's more of an experience, rather than just going out to a gig in a sweaty flea pit. Definitely a must do if you're visiting London and live in London, great to explore a developing area of the city. Loads of nice restaurants to choose from - everything from sushi to Gaucho's, and even an S&M cafe if you like your bangers and mash woohoo! (i'm veggie but they do great veggie sausages). Saw the Spice Girls and the lovely Kylie here recently and travelled to the gigs via ye olde river Thames - loved it! So cool that you can get somewhere in London without needing to get on a smelly tube, added something special to the evening. There's also an S&M cafe on the boat - bangers all round then! ;o)",

There is also a very good selection of bars and restaurents to suit every appetite - i especially love Nando's!!!

    "text": "When I arrived in London in early 2001, the Millennium Dome was a huge joke: the worst failure of an over-hyped let's-kick-off-the-next-1000-years. No one, at the time, thought it would become the most popular ticket-selling venue in the world. I've been there five times, to see Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Roger waters, Duran Duran and Afrika! Afrika! I think that it's just about as amazing as a large venue can be. Access is so simple. The Jubilee Line runs right to it, and your short walk to the front door is entirely under cover. Buses, taxis, and driving are all accommodated for as well, though I can't imagine why you'd bother with the hassle of the last option. The building itself is gorgeous, I think, really interesting. Its only once you're inside that you realise how functional those exterior roof spikes are, because they remove any need for interior sightline-blocking supports. The lobby area is huge and ornate. It's got shops galore. The interior arcade of bars, restaurants, shops, movie theatres, skating rinks seems endless. None of it's cheap, of course, but if you want to beat the crowds, get there early, and have a fancy meal or a few glasses of wine before a show, you're well catered for. The performance area is great. Yes, it's huge, but it's round and very steep at the top, so even when up in the nosebleeds you're much closer than you would expect to be. There are tons of concession stands and toilets on every level. There seem to be plenty of staff on hand at all times, and they're very helpful. I've heard the nightclub-type venue inside the venue - the indigO2 - is quite cool, but I've not been in it yet. They've got lots of fenced-in exterior space, too, which is where they put the Afrika! Afrika! tent. The only painful part of a visit to the O2 is getting to the Tube afterwards. They throttle access into the Underground entrance after shows (to prevent crowds building up at the top of, and on, the descending escalators), which means you can often queue in the crowd for 10 or 15 minutes. I hate the fact that there are acts I can only see at a venue as large as the O2, but if I've got to do it, I can't imagine a better layout for doing so.",

    "text": "We went here for a Cliff Richard concert (the whole point and climax of me and my mom's trip to London!) and though it is outside the city of London, in Greenwich, it was super easy to get to via the Jubillee line. Best part is, the station is literally in front of the massive entertainment center, so no need to plan for extra travel. The architecture is very futuristic, and it was a nice contrast to all the historical buildings we were touring in London. There are many smaller food vendors in one fantastic looking building outside the main stadium, and once you enter you are met in a rather large quarter of restaurants and shops and clubs. It looks like you can enjoy your time before a big show or event at one of these places. For our show in particular, they had a large souvenir stand before you got into the arena. There were many people manning this station, so we didn't have to wait in line for my mom to get her hands on all her Cliff Richard goodies. The arena itself, for the show, was very comfortable and clean. There were ample amounts of concessions and bathrooms for the most part. The staff was very nice and accommodating (there were many older people at this show! ) My only complaint is that before you enter the stadium for your event, the bathrooms are hard to find and there weren't many of them.",

It did seem a little short on loos (though I guess there are loads of them in the individual parts), and we only spotted one shop that wasn't a caf\u00e9. Still it's a great place to wander around among the artificial trees and 'street life'. There's 'installations' to look at, and a place where you can make your own dance video for free. The open area outside on the way back to the tube station is also worth exploring. It doesn't look much, but look closer. There's a water wall, and the Greenwich Meridian cuts through, so you can get your piccy taken on that. At time of writing there was a display relating to the local area, which I didn't get time to look at, and a huge statue of Anubis for the Egyptian exhibition.",

Be warned, though, there are no cheap places to eat.There are a couple of large bars (including a Slug & Lettuce), coffee shops, an 02 shop (naturally), a news-agent, and - at busy times - a few free-standing stalls selling expensive nick-nacks.When there's a big event in the Arena, it can get very crowded and queues for the restaurants quickly build up, so it pays to arrive early if you want to eat before going to the event. If you are planning a cinema trip, it might also be worth checking what's on in the 02 before you travel - I went once when Cliff Richard was on - couldn't move for grey-haired Cliff fans!Be careful to check if you are driving as the carparks can be extortionately expensive (Vue cinema ticket holders, however, can get their parking for free). It may be better to park locally and get a bus up to North Greenwich (remember your Oystercards).Along from the restaurants are a couple of large open areas that are used to house other more temporary visitor attractions. Over the past three years, there's been a skating rink (2007), a ski slope (2008) and Carter's Steam fun-fair in the winter (almost deserted on Christmas Eve 2009, but also expensive - and some of the operators.... well, let's just say they weren't full of the Christmas Spirit!).

    "text": "Well done Mr. O2 for turning a White (dome-shaped) Elephant into a top arena! I must say, I hate the \"village\" aspect of the O2 with the silly, overpriced bars and restaurants. But the actual arena is wonderful. One of the better barns for acoustics, the O2 Arena possesses a decent clarity, even when I have sat in areas that normally sound woolly and inarticulate in other large venues. The rake and angle of seats are very conducive to having a decent view of the stage. My preference is having the stage set \"in the round\" as it was when Prince Nelson was hanging out there. Last night I went to see Norwegian-black-and-white-cartoon-characters, a-ha. It was a surprisingly good gig, especially as you get what you pay for. And I paid nothing. The gig itself labored a little in the middle, due to the fact that 10,000 people and I did not know any of the songs between \"The Nun Always Climbs on T.V.s\" and \"Cryyyyy Wooooooolf (Wooooo-oooooo)\". They had me won back again, especially with \"The Living Daylights\", but that's because I like Timothy Dalton as Bond. He had the best Aston. But was Welsh. And had a dent in his chin. Another treat last night was the corporate hospitality. Having a room to relax in before the gig is always nice, but having waitress service, free bar and full meal makes me begrudge having to resume watching gigs like a serf. The only fly in the ointment is using the Jubilee line after a gig - you are herded like an animal to the station and cram onto a tube if you are lucky to get one. And woe betide you staying a little late and missing the last train. The last time that happened, my then-girlfriend and I were so pissed off with each other that it ended the relationship. Either that, or the Ann Widdecombe impersonator with the large glasses and Red Piano that we had watched perform that night had poisoned our young and impressionable minds. Each explanation is plausible.",

    "text": "Ok, this is one MASSIVE stadium. The floor seats (section B for the Bon Jovi Circle tour) were amazing. I saw the rest of the people all the way up or behind the stage, and I felt both sorry for them and slightly queasy at how high up they were. The sound is brilliant, but a bit of a \"puddle\" is formed in the middle as the waves reverberate off the back and sides. So a good balance, but oh my god it was loud! Odd thing: they don't let you take bottles of water with their caps inside. They keep the caps. Also, you can't bring in water from beyond the security check when you get your ticket verified. Yes, almost like a flight post 9-11. Also, they sell 500ml bottles for \u00a32.50 in there. Monopoly, anyone? Overall I'd say that getting a seat near the front, even if it's on the side, is definitely worth more than a seat all the way at the back but in the centre. Because at least you'd get to see. The venue is absolutely HUGE.",

    "text": "If you want to eat before a concert at the O2 Arena, I have a tip for you. Get there early, and decide where you want to eat right away. We got there early, and were almost immediately attracted by a rather nice Thai restaurant. BUT . 'Let's see what else there is before we go firm on it!' That was a mistake, for there are an awful lot of food outlets within the Arena. By the time we'd checked them all, read their menus and returned to the Thai restaurant, we were told there'd be a 30 minute wait before we could even be seated. And, the concert started in 45 minutes. So, the search had to be confined to places where we could be seated and served almost straight away. The one we chose was the 'Armadillo', which wouldn't, normally, have been my first choice. They try desperately to 'be American', but don't quite make it. There's American beer on offer, but there's also Beck's beer \u00a0which is better and cheaper. I found the music a little too loud for my tastes, and the restaurant was a little crowded. But, nevertheless, the service was slick and efficient, and we couldn't complain about the food; fish and chips and a chili burger. It's just that the ambience doesn't quite do it for me.",

Shush, that's a word. The stage is amazing (unless you've got the seats behind the stage - really, what's the point?) and the sound is good. The whole place is shiny, well organised and I had a fab time. Even though I wish I'd been right in the old man rock action.

Good points are: there is a great selection of restaurants and bars (although on nights when live acts are playing, be prepared to queue). The actual music venue is enormous with the 'nose bleed' seats being very high up so avoid if you are fearful of heights. In the actual concert venue there are good bars and food vendors. The amenities are excellent, clean toilets, friendly staff. The cinema was excellent also, when big films are showing there are multiple screens showing the film and at frequent intervals so as not to disappoint.Downsides are: queuing for restaurants on nights when live acts are playing (sometimes up to 40mins) so get there early. With the venue being so big if you do get a seat near the back you may not enjoy the atmosphere quite as much. It is definitely worth a visit if only to see how they have made good use of the millennium dome.",

    "text": "The O2, formerly known as the Millenium Dome is a cool place to hang out over the weekend with your partner or a group of friends. The O2 hosts a number of retsuaraunts, including chains such as Nando's, Zizi's and Gaucho and others such as Las Iguanas, which is a Latin American restaurant and cocktail bar, there are also many American Grill places there. The revamped venue also has a number of bars and clubs, a cinema with a large number of screens and particularly expensive tickets and of course, what it is known for, it's concert venue, which is now taking a substantial amount of business from Wembley Arena. The O2 has been a host to many of music's biggest players, Alicia Keys, Kanye West, 50 Cent, Spice Girls and the phenomenal Prince. I have heard many frequent concert goers complain about the prices of tickets at the O2 in comparison to Wembley as now they are forced to go to the O2 and pay the O2's ticket prices to see their favourite artists. Nevertheless, I like the O2, it's located a mere fifteen minute drive from where I live and offers a variety of things to do all in one stone throw away from the next. There are always exhibitions and interactive things to do, it reminds me very much of City Walk in Orlando Fl. Transport is also great here, the Jubilee line runs right to North Greenwich station, which is where the O2 is located, security is particularly strict here, searches are carried out and metal detectors are located at the entrance.The only annoying thing about the O2 is that many bars close early due to being quiet for business, which means you can never gage what time your night may end. I found that on a Friday night most bars by eleven o clock were getting ready to close, we ended up heading to Urban Inc, a club in the O2, which was the only place open and staying open until three.If you haven't checked this place out yet then I would definitely recommend you do!",

I tend to prefer more intimate venues when I go to see gigs but some artists will only do the big arenas and this is definitely the best one I've ever been to! I've been 3 times to see Justin Timberlake (just after it opened) and the Spice Girls! It's absolutely huge with a floor, level one tier and a very high up tier (level four). I wouldn't recommend the fourth tier if you're scared of heights. I've only been on the fourth tier once when I received free tickets from a friend and I was scared to stand up cos we were such a long way up! And obviously the artist is like a dot in the distance haha. The floor has absolutely amazing views though as you're right in the middle of the action and the first tier is good too you're a bit away but you still get a very decent view! They also have a good range of places to eat and drink, as well as a cinema and club. The little indigo2 club does more intimate gigs which is great - I saw Timbaland there after the Justin Timberlake gig I attended and it was very good. Very intimate and after he'd left everyone partied on - it sort of turned into a club. Only downsides are the expensiveness of the food etc (but it's the same anywhere really!) and that it's over commercialised.",

Long story short (because there was a hell of alot wrong) - The staff were rude and abrupt, they confiscated my camera on the premise that no unauthorised photography was allowed they were then really rude when we left and got our camera back. Anyway after 7 months of trying to get someone to listen to my complaint and give me a straight answer (7 months i kid you not) i was contacted by the head of the O2 who apologised profusely and offered me complementary tickets to an event of my choosing and free parking for the event too! She took on board all of my issues and alleviated my grievance. When i returned to see the UFC again on my free tickets there was a noticeable change in the way the staff were acting (for the better) and the whole place seemed much much better. The arena itself is a pretty impressive building and unlike anything else you will visit. Only gripe is the acoustics arnt really up to much So the first experience was a 1 star venue but the second was a 4 star venue so i've give then a 3 star overall.",

    "text": "Of course I had a fabulous time here anyway because I was at the NKOTBSB concert, but this venue is really spectacular! \u00a0Getting there is easy... Jubilee Line to North Greenwich and follow the crowds. \u00a0If you are making a night of your concert/show, there are loads of restaurants and bars, both outside of the complex and inside. \u00a0Obviously most of them are chain restaurants, but still reasonable prices. \u00a0Some of the restaurants were busier than others... loads of queues spilling out into the walkway, but with a concert and the film festival, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Work BFF and I chose the Thai restaurant that was decent. \u00a0No wait, quick service, however, you did have to order off of one of their set menus. \u00a0As we walked to the entrance to the arena, there was even a bar with a set up conveniently on the walkway for those wanting a drink as they walked around. \u00a0Once you go in, there are various food/drink/souvenir vendors on each level. \u00a0Everything from fish and chips to popcorn and candy.The arena is massive, but we had pretty good seats... not to mention the guys were in the crowd... not just the seats on the floor, but up in the stands! \u00a0On the display around the arena, it told everyone when the last tube would be departing for Central London! \u00a0Getting out of the O2 took some doing and the obstacles on the walkway: \u00a0the chairs and things from the restaurants really slowed the crowd down, but the crowd still moved at a good pace. \u00a0Going into the tube station was a bit chaotic, but not once were we stood absolutely still... the crowd was still moving forward. \u00a0Even on the platform and getting on the tube, it wasn't overly crowded. \u00a0Really impressed with that many people!",

    "text": "This review is for IndigO2, the smaller venue adjacent to The O2. My favorite band, Wolfmother, performed an epic show at IndigO2 on 6 July 2012. Seeing as it was only 5 or so Pounds more than the standard ticket, we went for the Kings Row VIP seating and loved it. Kings Row includes a whole lounge area with a private bar and TV screens, comfortable lounge-style seating, and a separate VIP entrance. Worth every penny. I wish we had arrived a little earlier to enjoy the lounge more, but we never had to wait in line to order a drink and the prices were very reasonable for a concert venue in London (rum and coke and a double gin and tonic for approximately 12 Pounds). The acoustics are excellent, no echo and a very balanced sound. The opening act, Turbowolf, was terrible but that's certainly not the fault of IndigO2. The only thing that could be improved was the lighting. The lighting effects seemed off-the-cuff and not well coordinated with the music, as if programmed by someone with absolutely no familiarity with Wolfmother's songs. So, down a star for that. The bouncers were even pretty cool, very flexible and enjoying themselves while doing their job effectively. We even caught them rocking to the music on occasion. Overall, a very relaxed venue.In the end, the show as spectacular, the venue was great, and King's Row ended up being worth it. If you're looking for the mosh-pit experience, though, you will obviously want the standing area downstairs.",

    "text": "So I am one of those Nine Inch Nails fans that makes a vacation out of a few NIN tour dates. When they announced their UK/EU dates for the spring, I knew I had to come to London to see them. Unfortunately, with the time difference and a bit of indecision on my part, we got tix up in nosebleed. I figured it would be okay since NIN shows have great visuals and in the end I wasn't disappointed.Even though the venue is ginormous, the sound was great and so were the sight lines. I took a few videos and the sound quality was way better than I thought it would be which definitely speaks for the acoustics. The seats were comfortable (not like I sat in them for most of the show), but I appreciated being able to sit for a bit after some standard show dancing/fist pumping, etc.Pro-tips: do I even have to say that the Tube was the best way to get in and out of the show? There are a bunch of bars/restaurants/etc around the arena for pre or post show shenanigans if you're feeling uninspired to make real plans before or after.",

I do find it strange that if you have standing tickets you have to go to a totally different entrance to seating tickets, but it's never put me off.

There are plenty of places to eat - some good, some not so. Parking is expensive though, so I always bus it here. Theres also a cinema and coffee places such as Starbucks and regular exhibitions.",

We could see London.We went at sunset, so romantic! Not thinking about that, we were of course in a group full of couples, bleurgh. So we made fun of everyone to their disgust. Oh well! We had a brief safety announcement and then up we popped. You basically get attached to the stairs that lead you up to the viewing platform and clamber up. It's a weird feeling, the stairs aren't exactly solid so you do tend to bounce around a bit. The climb starts quite steeply as well so feel yourself srambling to get up but it levels out and you get a good 20 minutes at the top to look around and take in the sights - Canary Wharf on one side and random other bits of London on the other. I had fun watching the planes come in to City airport to land and waving at the people in the Air Emirates cable cars that go from the O2 over to the Excel centre. Then you scramble down and try incredibly hard not to fall, more difficult going down because the steep part is even steeper. Dear God! Definitely a good work out for the legs.All in all, not an unpleasant experience, but frankly a bit boring. Better than a generic card and box of chocolates though!",

You are given another quick safety/ rules chat at the bottom of a set stairs then your harness is double checked by guide before you go up to platform where they take your picture and then you begin.My friends volunteered for us to go first so I wouldn't back out lol it was odd at first because walkway was like walking on a trampoline, it was a hard go on the way up quite steep but wow oh wow is it worth it when you get to top platform what a view!!!! You have about 15 mins to wander around top platform which is plenty of time then you begin your decent. I quite enjoyed the decent bit but a lot people didn't guess it's personal preference. The whole climb took about an hour but I definitely think it was worth money and time I want to do it again :-) the guides are very conscious of safety and made the experience a great time. Definitely recommend going",

It is the home for super club Matter, and some of the best exhibitions in the world have graced this architectural wonder. There is a cinema and a multitude of mid-range restaurants and eateries to keep you topped up before a gig.Due to the sheer size, it is almost impossible for the place to hold a buzzy atmosphere.

Had to get a replacement bus service to some station somewhere on the way back so that took a lot longer - bit confusing if you're not used to transport in London but we made it : ) Anyway, great venue - massive, spacious, staffed by helpful enough people. Plenty of toilets, although there were still long queues. What really got me mad were the drinks prices though. I know you expect to pay more somewhere like this, but \u00a34.50 for a tiny bottle of cider? So I had to get 2 each time, in a pint glass, so between 2 of us we spent over \u00a330 on drinks.

It was my first time at The O2 as I never get to come around here when in London. I thought it was just the arena. I was surprised to find out it's a shopping centre. Not just one or two shops but lots of shops and restaurants. We got the last screening at the cinema as the one before was booked out. Had about an hour to spare. Decided to go for a meal. Looking around for places to eat and most were closing down. Las Iguanas was still opened for another hour or less. Ate there.Ofcourse the famous O2 arena is in there and it's one of the big entertainment venue in London. Lots of big concerts and other shows take place here. It is one of the biggest arenas. I would love to go see a show here next time I go.",

After booking it in advance I worried whether the weather might be really bad and had visions of getting soaking wet. \u00a0However we were really lucky as it was a really hot day and the sky was really clear so when we got to the top we had really good views over London.Climbing up isn't too bad, occasionally it is slightly tricky to get your harness through the gates, but after a bit of wiggle it gets through. \u00a0At the top you can mostly see Canary wharf, the docklands area and the Olympic park, where I could see the new Orbital structure. On the way down is the steepest part of the climb at 30 degrees, so you have to take it really slowly.They provide you with Ecco shoes and a blue vest top. \u00a0The only thing you can take up with you is a small camera or smart phone and the jacket has a pocket with a zip in it to keep it safe as you ascend and descend. \u00a0Don't forget to bring a pair of socks with you though to wear with the shoes, although they do sell them for \u00a31. \u00a0At the end there is a little gift shop where you can buy photos at the steep price of \u00a315 as well as little toys, t-shirts and drinks.After all the bouncing up and down the walk ways I did feel little bit dizzy when I got back down to firm ground. \u00a0Had a good time and would recommend it if you have the opportunity especially if you can get a discount.",

Security check was a bit of an overkill considering the type of show and demographic. For the most part the staff were really nice. \u00a0There was a mix up with our seat allocations, however, they were unable to assist us as they openly admitted that the venue sold 10% of the tickets to the public and they sold the rest to stubhub so unless the unsold tickets are given back to the venue than they could resolve our issue. In other words they openly work hand in hand with scalpels whereas in Canada they work very hard and denying the truth. In others words if I wanted to pay an extra $150 pounds I would've had my original seat that I had tried to select at the time of check out. We just sucked it up and dealt with it. Other than that the arena itself looks really cool. Strong wifi signal so that I could work on zine.",

I bought tickets through AXS and they were extremely unorganized at the ticket window when distributing tickets. Then when we were finally allowed to enter, they had us follow a path around the arena that ended up taking us almost all the way back to where we came from! The lines to get in and go through security were extremely long. Then, inside the arena, the food selections were only OK, and some of the seats in the place were so far from the court, especially behind the basket, I have no idea how anyone could see from there. The only good thing was the surrounding area outside the arena but attached, with restaurants and shops. However, it seemed to be inside but it was very cold and not heated. That was disappointing.",

    "text": "Up at the O2 is a new experience that seeks to get that extra bit of value from having such an iconic building. You can practically imagine how this idea was bandied around in meetings till they settled on the idea that it would be a great idea to let people climb over the \"white elephant\".The climb nearly didn't happen for our group because of the wine. Note, if the wind is above 40 mph, then they halt all upcoming walks until the wind level drops to a level below 35 mph. It's a bit of a silly system, as wind for one constantly changes. One minute it will be 50, then a few minutes later, into the low 20s, then back up. I'm sure when we actually started the walk, the wind MUST have hit above 35mph, but they're for sure won't walk you down when you're already a third of the way up. :/. What it DID do however was delay our walk so we just missed sunset on our \"sunset climb\":(. So a suggestion, if planning to do the sunset climb. Don't book the \"sunset climb\", book one or two sessions before that. You'll spend a good 30 minutes or so at the top, so you're sure to hit sunset by the time you're at the top.Anyway, you're first taken to a briefing room, where you're shown a humorous video about safety and how the event will plan out. After this you head to the room next door to get all your gear on. You end up looking (and feeling) like an astronaut. Then it's up and outside to start the climb.The climb to the top takes around 15-20 minutes. It can get quite windy up there, but the line is super secure with no risk to you. I like the fact that the platform you walk up is bouncy. Almost like it's trying to replicate what you imagine it should feel like to walk over a great big tarp. But importantly has the important function of reducing the amount of weight upon the actual O2 structure.At the top, you realise the O2 isn't really that high. But it's fine because the views are great. \u00a0Particularly over toward Canary Wharf. They even let you take your mobile with you to take pictures, safely stored in a arm pouch on your suit. It was very cold so the suits given were extremely welcome, but on a warmer day, I'm sure it would get quite hot inside them. So for sure, only have a t shirt on. You'll probably regret anything thicker.So in all, it's a good experience and one to tick off the bucket list. I didn't love it that much that I would outwardly recommend it to others, but I would say it's one of those to do if you're already thinking of it. It isn't cheap however at peak times, so if you can try to do it on a weekday.",

It is located on the Greenwich Peninsula and is accessed easily from North Greenwich station on the Jubilee Line or from a Thames Clipper.Nowadays, the O2 is an entertainment complex with a cinema, concert hall, restaurants and nightclubs. At the moment, it is home to the British Music Experience and the Titanic exhibition. The O2 Arena seats up to 20,000 and has been used for large stadium-sized concerts and sporting events. There is also a smaller club-style venue, the IndigO2. It's going to be hosting several of the Olympic games too.It is the largest dome of its type in the world. There are 12 support towers (12 hours on a clock face), 365 meters in diameter (one for every day of the year) and 52 meters tall (one for every week of the year). The roof itself is apparently lighter than the weight of the air underneath. From the air, you simply can not miss it. Once inside, it's bigger than you would think.",

    "text": "Despite the hype I never actually got to visit the 02 when it was the infamous 'millennium dome' and quite frankly I don't really mind! The venue as it is now is a fantastic place for everyone and I always enjoy a trip there.I have visited for a few different reasons, concerts, dinner, clubs, cinema but I must admit I mostly visit when I have tickets for something (Fleetwood Mac btw was the BEST!) As a venue I think its fantastic. Despite it's 20,000 capacity no view is a bad view and it doesn't feel huge compared with places like Wembley and Twickenham, where sitting at the back really does mean at the back. The acoustics are fairly good and I've always felt like I've gotten a good deal even when I've had the 'worst' seats. More than being just a venue, I am very fortunate to live a mere 10 minute bus ride from the 02 and thus often use it as my go to cinema or dining experience. It's the one time I appreciate living in South East London (come on restaurateurs we need more dining experiences in SE). The cinema is cineworld which are fairly reasonably priced and have huge screens. They show all the latest films and its easy to navigate your way to. With a plethora of restaurants you can really make an evening of it and they have something to suit everyone's tastes including Nandos, Las Iguanas, Byron, TGI Fridays and loads more. I'm a big fan of the outside bit where they have a mini Tesco, coffee shops and a nice space with fountains etc. My only suggestion would be to add shops. The 02 could be an 'all in one' with a shopping centre! Despite this it is the perfect place to catch dinner, a show or a film or even just a coffee! Especially if you havent made up your mind!",

But the biggest problem is it lacks decent independent restaurants and shops.

    "text": "It's a 23,000 seat arena venue - not much to say about it as it looks, feels and runs just like every other big arena I've been to. So instead this is just a completely logistical take of attending a concert.Showing up and getting the hell out: About a two minute walk out of North Greenwich station (Jubilee Line), I don't think there's any where to go but in the direction of the venue. Leaving was relatively painless and they had actual people directing as well as roping set up to flow the foot traffic in a relatively smooth way. No major complaints.Eating: Meh. Loads of options that are all mall-type chain and random offerings (Pizza Express, La Rouge, Armadillo, Water Margin, etc) and one \"gourmet\" option with Gaucho's. All are totally overpriced and had lines snaking out of them one hour before show time. Also, the outer ring is covered but not entirely enclosed, which meant it was FREEZING walking around in December and most places had \"patio\" seating right out on the (cold) main drag. The entire thing reminded me of Vegas hotel like New York New York. It's not worth the jacked up pricing or the atmosphere, in my opinion. Try to eat or drink before getting to the arena area. The arena venue itself: \u00a0Was functional enough - sound was decent, security was friendly, seating was typically cramped but not painful -- and made no lasting impression. You can get beer, wine and champagne by the bottle (a bit much but ok) and take drinks to your seat. It is in dire need of bigger / better placed large screens. It's a low blow to be paying for a live concert only to resign to watching them the show on a screen as it is --- so at least make these accessible to all the far away seats!Other stuff: There isn't much to do besides eat or get a drink. They did have one small shop if you wanted water or gum or a packaged sandwich, but nowhere to sit and hang out. They have decided you are there to consume and have not made it easy to do much else ... including use the toilet. I walked around nearly the whole thing before finding a giant toilet sign that lead OUTSIDE to an upgraded porta-potty situation (toilets as expected once inside the arena itself). Hmmph. Overall impression: I think it's meant to be a destination even if you aren't going to an event at the arena (there is a cinema here too) but why you would drag ass out there and overpay to eat, drink, etc is beyond me.",

    "text": "I was rather disappointed with my visit to the O2. First, I think it is preposterous and a waste to make visitors throw out any drink containers upon entry. This just enforces longer queues. Additionally, there is no re-admittance if you leave during intermissions. I really wanted to go out to the proper restaurants (there's a GBK, Yo Sushi, etc around the perimeter), but we were stuck with the expensive arena options. The choices were minimal, and the food - theoretically ready-to-go McDonald's style, took time to prepare and all the stations were understaffed. Thus we missed the beginning of the show while waiting for burritos. There are also very few allergy-friendly options. There was also no system of queuing in place for these eateries. For \u00a38.50, I got a burrito that didn't taste properly Mexican, and that I was promised was ready but had to wait 15 minutes for.I can't remark on the ticketing situation as my friend bought my ticket, but I heard many people complaining that it was similarly disastrous. Although I enjoyed seeing Monty Python live, I'd prefer to go to a smaller local venue for my comedy shows. The nosebleed section doesn't quite cut it.",

Live music, food, and drinks all within 100ft, party time! The O2 is attached to the London Underground which makes it easy to get to and from the venue, so you don't have drive. This place is also located right off the river, so weather can change from cold, to rainy, and back to cold so bundle up! I came here for the, \"My Name Is Prince\" exhibit which took place in the green room and back areas of the O2. In fact part of the exhibit, was set up like an exact replica of Prince's normal backstage lounge, fully equipped with satin curtains, burning incense, and Prince's full tour closet with all of his actual clothes still in them. I was even able to hold one of his guitars that he actually played, it was amazing! This exhibit has since ended, but is supposedly coming to the states soon. Never been here? Make some plans and get here soon!",

It's like the Brazilian version of Nando's!To get into the actual arena, you have to go through a security check where they will take your food off you. There is a sign up saying \"no food or drink past this point\" but when you get into the waiting room, they are flogging popcorn and ice cream at \u00a34 a pop!The show was really great - Saara Aalto wowed with her crazy balloon set-up and Honey G was hilarious! I recorded a little bit of every act which was a good idea as everyone was different! There was a good crowd but there were still quite a few empty seats in some blocks.If you are going to use the toilet, go before the show starts as the queues were pretty long at the interval and at the end!I did like the O2 but it was extremely expensive, for example, I wanted to buy a programme but they were \u00a310!!!",

Usually when I'm seeing a live performance the most thought I put into the actual venue is finding the address so that I get to the correct place. Luckily, the O2 was actually a very nice arena and made the absolutely amazing show a bit nicer experience. The O2 has its own subway station, which made traveling here quite easy. There are multitudes of other things in the area, including movie theaters, restaurants, and you can even climb up the side of the arena (for a nominal fee of course). Pedestrian traffic in and out of the arena was fairly brisk considering how many people were there and the all of the staff we encountered were quite friendly. The prices for food and drinks inside were high, but that's universally seen at any sports arena or theater. I will say that their idea of nachos was pitifully bad - mealy chips with a watery \"cheese\" is just pathetic, but I should have known better since I was in London and not the States. All in all, it's a pretty good venue and I would definitely see another live performace there if I'm ever in the area again.",

But there is a large variety of places to eat, a Cineworld, exhibitions, places to hang out, and even (currently) one of those machines that presses a penny flat (Brian C is addicted).For the venue portion - the main venue is really strict on what you can take in. I saw 2 small bags of crisps confiscated when I was there last week to see U2. Plus they take all the caps off bottled drinks, so if you're feeling devious, slip a bottle cap into your pocket.Even though we had limited view seats (ie, behind the stage) we could see everything. Personally, I think the upper tier seats are just really a bit too high to properly enjoy myself, and I'd rather have less central seats a level down. The best way to go though, if you can swing it, is in a corporate box - they usually have bar service within the box, and a large selection of private seats. The few times I've been lucky enough to go and be in a box, I found that most people were more interested in the bar than the concert, and I had a great view with lots of space around me - bliss.",

After queuing, we were inspected at the entrance (bag was briefly searched and we were patted security style). I guess this type of security followed Paris attacks, as I remember at a previous Muse concert only my bag got briefly searched. The security staff was very friendly and accommodating.When entering the concert venue, we were pleased to see the stage across the venue (which I think it is not the case and has been specially arranged for Muse). Throughout the concert this type of configuration allowed the standing and seated public to enjoy a closer look and feel to the band. And I was even able to touch all three members of the band! (My excitement is beyond the written word...). The staff was incredibly nice, handing cups of fresh water to the standing public, making jokes and smiling at us. They were also very \"serious\" when it came to checking on people who were pushing on the back and who stopped immediately. They were super nice.The acoustic were fantastic and the light and special effects were INCREDIBLE. It is renowned that Muse has the craziest live shows and I can agree for the second time that it was the case. There were drones, a giant floating space ship, giant balloons thrown at the crowd to play with, paper man shot in the air and lots of light. I absolutely loved it. As I read on the previous comments the toilets were considered an issue. I thought so too when I saw a monstrous line for the females, but it was just matter of 3/4 minutes and I was also able to access the powder room. So pretty impressed by the efficiency. The only negative point I have is the price-to-taste ratio of food sold inside the concert venue. We got 2 beers and a hotdog with chips for 25\u00a3, which is so incredibly expensive that I think only the adrenaline of the moment made us accept this price. Beers were ok, but the hotdog was just typical boring school canteen food and the chips were quite oily. For 25\u00a3 try to wait until the concert is over and eat just outside. Overall, I recommend this venue. However I also thinks it comes up to who is playing and how are you positioned inside the venue. Muse was just amazing.",

It's always a great idea to pop into a bar grab a few cheeky drinks then head to a gig. It was very vibrant and great experience. The bars range from All bar one, Slug and Lettuce. You also have the chance to climb up the O2 unfortunately I was too pissed to do so, but definitely something exciting to try in the day. Might I add, I throughly enjoyed Fleetwood Mac, definitely one of my favourite concerts.",

I had to leave early too because of the train times but I suppose that was a blessing, the queues to come out of there were hell, from what I heard!The restaurants and bars leading into the venue were packed out and drinks were too expensive!!",

It's impossible to get any food or drink under \u00a35 as you're a captive audience in the little dome. This isn't such a bad thing, but there simply are no other options. Having said that the architecture of the dome itself is pretty interesting, and great to see the Blackwall Tunnel ventilation shaft inside it. And all the ropes that hold it up! Other than that, it's in a bit of a no-man's land. Quick tip - if you're going there and want to get back to central london, try the Thames Clippers - awesomely fast!",

The acoustics are terrible and unless your seats are lower down it can be difficult to enjoy (the seats higher up come with a warning to those who have even slight vertigo). The food is really varied but very expensive. Transports links are good though and I recommend getting the boat along the thames home, it's \u00a34 for a single journey but is so worth it!

You can go and see an exhibition (Tut Anch Amun), to see a concert (in one of the 2 concert hall), to dine (all cuisines) etc. and all of this on the same day in the same venue. The possibilities are lierally endless. I went there for quite some concerts and of course the tickts are not cheap and easy to get, because they are highly sought after, but it is worth the trouble.If you are prepared to pay some money you can also get returned tickets on the day of the concert itself at the official ticket stands.I also really appreciate that there are no ticket touts standing in front of thevenue selling fake tickets for 10 bucks. Another important factor is that it is easy to reach from central London (via Jubilee line) and that the tube station has basically a direct link to the venue, so you can't get lost.",

There is the MASSIVE arena, which hosts acts like Justin Timberlake, Elton John, Tina Turner, and Girls Aloud. Do go for the more expensive closer tickets because like all massive arenas the further you are back the more likely you will be watching the show on the monitors, and lets face it you cold be doing that at home when the DVD comes out for a fraction of the cost. \u00a0It also converts in to a sports venue and in2012 will host the Gymnastic and Basketball Olympic events. For those who prefer a more intimate musical experience there is the Indigo O2 which is smaller but has a standing areas, sitting areas( with table service) and a lounge areas. This venue has hosted acts such a Timbaland, Joss Stow, & Natalie Cole, all great acts but not necessarily going to sell out the arena. If you are in the mood for a bit of dancing after the concert then hit the club Matter with three flours of \u00a0music for your dancing needs. \u00a0If you enjoy unsigned acts then there is the Basking Stage, where who knows you could be watching the next Beatles make a name for themselves. Forget going ice skating at Hyde Park this year and instead go to the O2 and go \u00a0INDOOR SNOWBOARDING!!! How cool is that? There is even modern art at the O2 centre, inside of the O2 Bubble is the current Bodies Exhibition ( not for the faint of heart). There is a Vue Cinema and plenty of places to eat and drink. It would take you a very long weekend to experience everything the O2 has to offer and with the events constantly changing you can never experience the same thing twice.",

It seemed of a better quality and perhaps a higher budget than most exhibitions that i have been to around London and fully warranted the cost. I took the time to have a decent look around the venue whilst i was there and thought it had an interesting atmosphere owing to its unique design and i would definitely consider returning for a music event to test out the acoustics.",

So to be blunt, this concoxion is a waste of money.It is a great place to go for a night out with friends or for a birthday - there are dozens of bars and restaurants and also a cinema,etc. The one negatvie thing to note is that it is quite intimidating and dangerous late at night (on the weekend especially)!Last time we went out for dinner with a few friends, as we were leaving it all kicked off at the club. The kids spilled out of a club, some with blood on their t-shirts and the bouncers pushed them towards the exit, where we were heading! As we walked around the corner, there were two boys unconscious ahead of us. It was a mess and this is a clear example of the type of clientele that frequent the o2.Dont get me wrong, 95% of people are not like that, but I do not intend you visit it again anytime soon!",

Inside the venue you will find helpful and fairly friendly staff, although they are of course very jobsworth in such a corporate place and will be keen on, for instance, stopping you from taking illegal photos of the concert (as if you're about to make a pile of cash from photographing Leonard Cohen from 500 miles away on a mobile phone), and a soundsystem that is much better than many venues of a similar size.And of course, where else are you going to see the acts that play here? have fun!",

It's very easy to get to, we usually get the Jubilee line as it's about a 2 minute (probably less) walk from the door of the station to the door of the o2. Jsut be careful on your way out as I've found that after concerts tryign to get back into the tube station can be diffiult and I've seen a lot of pushing (as well as a lot of people being very sensible about it). There's lots of places to eat and drink before your show, all with varying prices and to suit most appetities. There's alsoa news agents but be careful because often you can't take drinks in. Once you're in the actual venue there's lots of places sellign drinks and sweets but they're very expensive - you're better off to stay outside and enjoy your refreshments then buy as little as possible once you've given in your ticket.

    "text": "I went to the Millenium Dome 9 years ago and it was interesting to see how it had been changed into not only a venue but a load of restaurants and exhibitions. The prime reason for me going was to see Girls Aloud but my girlfriend wanted to go to the Bodyworlds Exhibtion before hand. It was expensive at \u00a314 each for adult but luckily we had a voucher so it was really two-for-one. It was a reasonable exhibition that took at least one hour to walk around. I would have preferred to see the music one though! After the exhibition we wanted to go to Nando's or Pizza Express but the queues were too long. Instead we went to S&M which seemed to specialise in Sausages & Mash. It was very overpriced but did the job. The venue itself is very big and we were sat on Level 4 so didn't have the best view. The sound was OK as expected but I don't think I would rush back to see another gig there. I prefer smaller venues.",

Parked 100 yards or so from the (private) entrance & with a pack of laminates around my pre-medallioned neck and was ushered into the uberprivate musos & friends bar for champers - so much for Red Wedge eh!? I can confirm that this ultra cool spot is THE bar you've been looking for all your Qype life! Right next door to the Blackwall Tunnel too! Who'd credit it? Great venue, decent sound. I have no comment on the public bars & restaurants as I didn't go near 'em. The gig finished & I returned to my natural level in life. The gutter.",

    "text": "Probably one of the best venues in London. Great food outlets. Parking is great. It is well signposted driving up to the place along the A2. One drawback is the views aren't too clever on the higher tiers. There are giant video screens on each side of the screen. I am a wheelchair user. There are plenty of wheelchair seats. Try to get the ones nearer the stage. The other ones are on tier three. Which is OK for the food stands but not so hot for viewing the stage. The whole use of the dome as a multi-media centre is a brilliant use of space. Go see it!",

    "text": "You know, this place is pretty easy to diss being big and corporate and all that.but having lived withing 100 yards in Milllenium Village and walked to concerts of a summer eve, I'm a pretty big fan. And I can't even remember coming here when it was the 'dome' although I remember paying big prices for doing so! Good viewing from all seats, although admittedly pretty tiny from the 'cheap seats', there are usually screens beside the stage that offer great views of performances. Good bar/toilet to person ratio on each floor (it's important when you're rushing between songs from a favourite album versus the new stuff no-one knows!). Good pre-and after-concert restaurants and bars in the place too, as well as a range of ways of getting home - recommend the boat to London Bridge and down the river, which runs till the wee hours, a classy and comfy way to get home. I've seen people from Prince to Snow Patrol, Dolly Parton to Justin Timberlake and Scissor Sisters here and they were all unique in their own way, with the stage arranged differently and a different feel each time. This and the Royal Albert Hall (for entirely different reasons) are my favourite concert venues in the city Have yet to check out the Tutankhamun exhibit but it's on the (ever expanding) list.",

The arena is massive yet you can still get a pretty good view even up in the nose bleeds. It could do with more fast food places around the outside and not just sit down restaurants as I'm often running late for things and don't want to be waited on whilst I'm running late, but getting in and getting out is no problem despite the number of people.",

I found it easy to get to by tube. There is a multiplex cinema inside with 11 screens and you can get very cheap tickets for children. Inside the O2 there are 548 toilets so you won't be queuing for ages. Parking is available outside and if you go to the cinema and retain your ticket then you can claim the money back that it has cost you to park. Inside the O2 bubble they have exhibitions on in different months and the parking cost is \u00a35 for all day.",

It is really easy to get to, just a Jubilee line train to North Greenwich, and from the station it's about a 5 minute walk, which is clearly marked. The new owners have really made it somewhere people want to visit and when I went recently with a friend it was real fun. I visited the cinema and afterwards took a walk around, it was nighttime, and it looked amazing! All those lights were really amazing, it's like a city, but undercover. It's really amazing. And the O2 also hosts many concerts and even Gunther Von Hagen's Body World's which looks fantastic. Before I really disliked the Millennium dome, but now it's somewhere that is worth going.",

The sheer scale of the place has to be seen to be believed, it is like a mini town all on its own. Pride of place now is the 23,000 seater indoor arena which is now the best in the country (yes MEN arena, really!) Great for sporting events, though its acoustics have been criticized at gigs there. Outside the arena itself but still housed within the dome seems a huge village of shops, restaurants & public houses and even a massive cinema. The whole building is very spacious and overwhelming. Transport to and from the O2 is by tube and Thames Clipper",

We love going there for the music but find the food places inside rather plastic and a bit chain like. If you are going to the O2 and like Chinese food, there is a Chinese Restaurant next to the Express Holiday Inn that is fabulous. They specialise in Dim Sum and is generally full of foodies! Loads of Chinese people go there and I can honestly say do some of the best Dim Sum we have had. Worth a visit if you can slot it in:-)",

However, due to the size i really try to avoid it as a band venue as depending on where you are you can really feel distanced to what is going on. It's well organised so there is not a huge headache to get out and onto the tube like there is with Wembly etc. Getting the boat to/from is always fun and quite cheap too. Also the bars and restaurants really fill up before events so if you want to eat/drink first get there early.",
