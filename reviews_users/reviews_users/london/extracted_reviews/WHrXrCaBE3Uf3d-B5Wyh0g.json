    "text": "I'd been wanting to try one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants for a while now and this place did not disappoint! I was well satisfied by both the food and service. For starters, I got to try the cured salmon with yuzu avocado puree and the baked scallop - both dishes had wonderful (but different) tastes, but I definitely liked the scallop more. The salmon was a bit lighter while the scallop had a stronger feel (especially because of the bacon).For the main course I went for the steamed sea bream, which I also really enjoyed! The fish was cooked perfectly and had an amazingly soft (yet not mushy) texture. With the clams, sauce, and the sprouting broccoli, I thought the dish was extremely well balanced - although the broccoli was a bit overcooked in my opinion, as I would've preferred a harder texture.And the dessert...my friend and I, who are major fans of dessert, decided to go for the chef's selection plate, which came with four items: eton mess, dark chocolate tart, pineapple and melon carpaccio, and the baked New York cheesecake. Unfortunately, I only really liked the cheesecake. I wasn't a fan of the eton mess (mostly because I'm not a fan of merengue), the dark chocolate was too dense for me, and the pineapple and melon carpaccio just didn't appeal to my taste buds (probably because when it comes to dessert I don't really prefer fruity things). However, the cheesecake was REALLY GOOD - probably one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. The service was great too, and our waitress was super sweet. My only real complaint is for the dessert chef's selection plate, which I felt was underwhelming especially compared to the starters and main course. If you want dessert, I'd definitely suggest getting the cheesecake over the other three I tried! Or maybe the chocolate fondant...which I'll definitely be trying the next time I visit.",

    "text": "I wish to convey in few words my profound enjoyment of the Beef Wellington, this establishment's signature dish. The perfect arrangement of flavours, meticulously swirled oil paints upon the blank canvas of your tongue. An experience I could only describe as a waltz in your mouth, the sheer tenderness of the Beef \u00a0dancing in a flowing dress of red wine upon the dancefloor of portobello. The crispy flakes keep you on your toes until they melt away into song, a medley that never becomes bland. A burst of aromatic cherry tomato cleanses the palate, renewing your vigor bite after bite. As the dish nears it's end, like Cinderella in the ballroom approaching midnight the Magic will fade from your palate, a memory on your lips, the long 45 minute wait a reminder of the toils endured to step into those glass heels. I highly recommend.The Scampi was pretty good, but found the chicken skewers lacking substance.",

Lovely decor, nice outdoor seating as well, had a reservation and sat right away. We started with the scallops, which were everything that you could imagine and more. Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. We then shared the beef Wellington and truffle mashed potato. The menu says that the beef is a 45 minute wait, and they were pretty accurate on the timing. WOW!! Your knife cuts like butter through the meat, perfectly cooked and delicious. You don't even need the sauce that accompanies it. The truffle mash was a little strong and first, but very good. Would highly recommend and will be back when I'm in the area again.",

A great venue with outdoor seating if you prefer, and inside, it's swanky as ever. I can imagine it being a great place to have an evening drink, along with dinner. The staff are superb, quick, and kind. The full english is lean and rather light--in a good way--for what it is. The tea china is beautiful and matching, and come on, that's mostly why it's so fun to order tea at a restaurant (for me at least). The porridge was just meh. Perhaps I was expecting something a little more flashy and garnished, but I suppose that's what I get for breaking the cardinal rule of never ordering porridge at a restaurant, when I could go home and throw some plain oats and boiling water in a sauce pan, serve up, and eat as it is. Nonetheless, would definitely return for a second more substantial meal.",

We also met Neo the head chef. This is a man that loves his job and takes extreme pride in this restaurant and the quality of the food.

    "text": "Me and some friends booked a table for brunch here and had planned to use 2-4-1 vouchers through Emerald Street. When we got there, we were given a separate menu made up of just 3 items; muesli, egg & bacon roll, and scrambled egg with salmon. If any of us had been a vegetarian, we'd have been stuck with a measly bowl of muesli. (I've just checked their site and it looks like they've changed the Emerald Street menu, but the deal ends today, so a little too late). As it was cold and wet outside, we decided to stay where we were and just order from the main menu. This meant we couldn't use our vouchers and would have to pay full price for everything we ordered. 2 of our party went for the full English breakfast which didn't look to filling at all, with only 1 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon, 1 big mushroom, 2 tiny (and overdone) poached eggs and a tomato. There wasn't even any toast! This plate is priced at \u00a311.50, and if you wanted an ungenerous extra side of baked beans, it would set you back \u00a33! Another of our party ordered the avocado on pumpernickel toast, which was very much burnt. The service wasn't too great either. Our waitress came over to ask why we hadn't paid the service charger, and after giving her out reasons, she practically rolled her eyes at us. Safe to say we shan't be going back.",

    "text": "After watching Gordon Ramsey for years, finally had the chance to dine in one of restaurants in London. After reviewing the choices, we made a reservation at HSK. The location is in a very cool part of Piccadilly and the decor is cool. As one of his more casual restaurants, no dress code but as it was a Friday night, we spiffed up. Was seated right away upstairs facing the courtyard (it faces a small private street with other restaurants). That is where the issues started. After being seated, it took quite a while for drinks to be delivered. We are talking about a bottle of wine and water. From that point on, we had to ask for water. Mind you, the table next to us had water glasses refilled many times without asking. For example, I flagged down a server and asked for water. The server returned to the table next to us, looked over at our empty glasses and filled their water. That's it. End of story. One of Gordon's trademarks is hot food. Always make sure the whole table is served. My sirloin was lukewarm at best. It took several minutes to get anyone's attention to ask for it to be reheated. By time a new one was brought to me my whole party had finished. Out of 4 dishes, the best compliment was for the Mac & cheese, does that say something? Not once did anyone check on us throughout the visit if not flagged down by us. In shows like Kitchen Nightmares, Chef Ramsey preaches customer satisfaction is most important. Sadly, my party and I did not get that attention. The food would have been better if the experience was better.",

    "text": "This was a successful last minute Yelp search. It was our first night in London so was looking for traditional British food. My wife mentioned Beef Wellington and I was on a mission. Overall the food experience was good but the place lacked some basic details to make it great. Would rate 4 or higher if a little more value and waitress had more menu knowledge.Upon first walking in at around 6:30-7pm it was a little quiet but nice atmosphere. We were quickly addressed at the host bar and taken to our seats. We did not have reservations so they took us to a less desirable spot that had a burnt out light near a waiter hub. At first I was really annoyed as there were plenty of open seats in better spots but after 15 minutes the place really filled up. \u00a0As in many places, make reservations in advance.The waitress was quick to visit, a little dry and quick to offer bottled water, tap water is good in London. She also offered bread and olives, I knew from previous dining experiences this would be at cost, so heads up. The bread and olives were great though.They had a decent drinks list and I had the \"More Than Illegal\" cocktail a sweet bourbon based drink with banana flavours. It tasted great if not a bit thick because of the banana pur\u00e9e. I was disappointed when I asked the waitress what one of the contents was and she didn't know and didn't really make an effort to inform herself. In the end, didn't want to make a deal so ordered anyways, good choice though.For the meal I ordered beef Wellington... curse my wife's lack of hunger! She only wanted a salad and the beef Wellington could only be ordered for 2. My 1st world dreams (for the evening) were dashed. I ordered the 8oz filet which was very good! My wife's beetroot salad was awesome and would have worked great as a side to the steak.The overall cost seems high for the decor level but the food quality is very good. Want to dine here again, except when my wife is hungry to order the Beef Wellington.",

When I found out that I could have Gordon's version, we had to do it. We arrived early because we also had the Cocktail Masterclass (another hobby) and wanted to allot plenty of time. While the wellington was top notch, the masterclass sticks out as a highlight of our entire trip. Georgi (head bartender?) is easily the person I remember most of any meal I had while visiting London. He went above and beyond anything I've ever experienced at a restaurant and made the night/trip for us. We had an incredible time at Heddon St and honestly it blew away our meal at Petrus (or anywhere else). Nothing against Petrus, but that's how special the service from Georgi and team was. His knowledge of cocktails and crafting them to fit specific tastes is second to none. He spent nearly 30 minutes getting to know my wife and I and crafting two unique cocktails to suit our tastes. After we finished the cocktail class and headed to our table, he came over a few more times to check on us and make sure everything was perfect. You couldn't ask for a better date night than a cocktail masterclass at Heddon St with Georgi followed by an incredible meal.",

Seems like a pretty simple request... speaking of the Caesar salad, we also had to ask for pepper to add to the bland dressing. For entrees, we had the cod and sea bass. Both were decent, but came with the skin still on, which Gordon always tells people not to do unless it's crisp. \u00a0Also they charge \u00a33.50 for four pieces of bread and a pat of butter.

Some dishes were nice and some were just hard to eat. We had the set menu as this seems good value at \u00a326 for three courses (but with the Time Out offer you also get a dessert cocktail). \u00a0A choice between the Rillettes of Scottish Salmon, avocado and watercress or Mushroom and Parmesan soup for starters. \u00a0I chose the former and my partner chose the latter. \u00a0I wish I chose the latter now, as the soup was really creamy and tasty, whereas the salmon was disappointingly plain and tasteless. On to the mains, I chose the wood oven roasted trout with buttered leeks and my partner chose the slow braised British beef, parsley and garlic. \u00a0Again, he chose the better dish. \u00a0The braised beef was lovely and tender. I could hardly eat my buttered leeks as they were so salty. Even eating it with the bland tasting trout could not take away the saltiness. Perhaps, they put double salt in error. \u00a0Then on to the dessert. \u00a0Finally, I chose well. \u00a0I had the mulled wine meringue, which consisted of a mulled wine sorbet with a mess of meringue and cream, which went really well together. My partner had the caramel chocolate mousse, which arrived in a little pot with a lid, which he mistook for a sugar bowl. \u00a0On opening the lid, there were small broken pieces of shortbread biscuits, no sign of the chocolate mousse. \u00a0Digging deep into the little pot only brings up very sweet caramel. Service was a little lax. \u00a0We also had to ask for our dessert cocktail and they had to keep checking the offer as they did not know/remember what we had booked, \u00a0whether it was the two or the three courses, with or without dessert cocktail.The cocktails were nice enough though, and the restaurant has a relaxed and friendly feel. \u00a0However, we left feeling underwhelmed by the whole experience, as even with the offer, the bill came to over \u00a383. \u00a0For that price, we could have eaten much better and more interesting elsewhere.",

    "text": "One of the most disappointing meals I had in London! I had high hopes for one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, as I'm a huge admirer of his work. It was my first time dining at one of his establishments and it might be my last. For someone who constantly criticizes others, you would think that he'd make sure his food was above the rest.As far as the ambiance and service, everything was fine in that regard. Waiters and hosts were polite and attentive, nothing above and beyond, but adequate for a restaurant of that supposed caliber. The decor was very interesting, a very nice blend of industrial and classic.Unfortunately where all stars are lost in this review was the food. I started with the Roasted Lamb Rump with a side of Roasted Vegetables. There was no semblance of temperature, as the lamb was cold, but the rest of the dish (gem lettuce and onion) was hot and limp and soaking wet in what I can think was the au jus. On top of it being cold, the lamb was tasteless and chewy as leather. And the side of roast veggies were cold, too!I flagged a waiter and had it sent back for the Sunday Roast. And would you imagine, that was cold and tasteless, too! It had hard fat in it, but at least this time it was edible enough and the roast veggies were hot and flavorful. I was starving, so I dealt with it. Thankfully, they did the honorable thing and comped the dish, but if that's what to be expected at Heddon Street or any of GR's restaurants, I'll be eating elsewhere.",

    "text": "Call me a fan boy that's fine, but when we began to plan our trip to London, there was only one thing I really wanted to do. It wasn't Buckingham Palace, wasn't Piccadilly Circus, all I really wanted was to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Like I said, I'm a fan!Booking from home in Toronto, Canada, I began to seek out a Ramsay restaurant and was stumped when I saw he didn't have just a couple of options, he had somewhere around 20 in London alone! I knew price would be a factor so after looking at some different options I ruled out the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 options because I knew it just wasn't feasible to do so (which made me a little sad because I know fine dining is where Gordon really shines). But after speaking with some local pals in the UK, comparing some web reviews on Yelp and other sources, I settled on Heddon Street Kitchen for it's more casual atmosphere and \"slightly lower\" price point.We made an early reso for 5pm and arrived shortly after opening for evening service. It's in a great location on Heddon Street, an alley way style cobblestone side street just away from the hustle and bustle of the main roads. I was so happy I was literally jumping in my skin from the moment I walked in. The look and the feel of this place was rustic and slightly industrial with a polished finish. It was totally in my element.Even being a more casual look and feel the steps of service were still as spot on as if you were at a Michelin star spot. From the hostesses to the servers to the Somm who was sent to our table the moment we decide we might be interested in ordering a bottle of wine with our meal.We began with a pair of cocktails, I opted for one of the \"before meal\" cocktails named - From a Few to a Thrill which had Campari, Martini Rosso, Grapefruit bitters, fresh orange and Prosecco, It was slightly bitter but by the end had opened up my taste buds and was delicious! My girlfriend opted for an early evening cocktail option called My Pear Lady, made with Bombay Sapphire Gin, fresh pear, rosemary, lemon and soda. She loved it!To begin, I HAD to have a Ramsay Scallop appetizer. I mean after watching season after season of his shows and the scallop being the most elusive dish to do well, I knew I needed to have it. I was presented with 3 meaty scallops beautifully plated, and perfectly cooked. My girlfriend had a mushroom flatbread. Both were amazing and had us making audible sounds of enjoyment.Following our cocktails, we spoke with the sommelier, and discussed with him what we were having for our appetizers and mains and he made some recommendations for us to consider. We settled on a well priced medium bodied Spanish red called Pasi\u00f3n de Bobal. It was so amazing I could have drank a bottle to myself.Following the appetizer course and enjoying a glass of wine (or two) from our bottle our mains arrived promptly, The decision on mains was torture for me, I knew I could only pick one and I likely wouldn't be able to come back here for a long time again. After some tears I decided to go for the lamb entree which came with a polenta mash and a roasted tomato. I added a side of green beans done with parmigianno. From first bite to last I was in heaven, easily some of the best lamb I've ever had, like ever! I'm not a huge polenta fan but if someone made it like this for me everyday I would have no issue eating this. Finished with those beans! Oh those beans! Such a simple dish but the perfect match for the dish!Shortly after the main course the dessert menu came around but we decided to politely decline so as to not be overly stuffed and so we could enjoy the rest of our wineA fantastic experience and one that I wish I could have regularly. Alas, there are no Gordon Ramsay restaurants on Canada's east coast, so to enjoy Gordon's fine fare I'll need to seek out some of his locations in the USA. Until then, I have fond memories and great pictures to remind me of my delicious experience on Heddon StreetEatcrest Out",

Yum! Everything tastes fresh and delicious and you can see the chefs busy at work in the kitchen.

The Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection so it melted in your mouth along with many other staple flavors in the signature dish. The only problem was that there was too much puff pastry and was a little heavy. The real star of the day though, was the cod. It was full of flavor and every element of the dish worked together to make an amazing finish. Every bite left you hungry for more. For dessert, we got the sticky toffee pudding, a Gordon Ramsay classic. It was definitely one of the best things I had during my trip to the UK. We also got the make your own ice cream bar. There was everything to top the wide selection of flavors from Jelly Beans to marshmallows or merengue, we had it all! The lady serving my brother and I was super kind, helpful, and chatty, she was great! Overall, I thought the food was really good and the service was spot on.",

Unfortunately my first choices of both starter and main had sold out - but there were still plenty more delicious options. For a starter, I chose the Spicy Tuna Tartare, wonton crisps and creme fraiche. It was a very unusual texture and not that spicy, still enjoyable but I much preferred the Tamarind Spiced Chicken Wings. Well-spiced with a sticky glaze and an impressive portion - these, I'd definitely have again.One thing I always appreciate, especially during the colder months, is a big ol' bowl of tasty mac'n'cheese. Heddon Street Kitchen's offering is very much up there with the very best of the best. Rich slow-braised beef cubes, ooze-y cheese and an almost-too-much portion size, perfect. We alsoended up ordering the caesar salad with boiled egg, pancetta and anchovies. A tad bit more adventurous than my normal caesar salad style, the dressing was lovely and rich. Overall, definitely worth the cashsplash - plus, they do 2for1 details on the regs so even if you're on a budget, you don't have to miss out!",

Really delicious pastry, carved perfectly. I would say it's not the best thing for a wooden board due to all the juices. Nevertheless the flavours were fabulous and we were very pleased. The truffle mash was excellent if very small in portion. The spinach was large leaf spinach and the onion rings were large and very crispy. Extra jus came in a side jug which was delicious too.Service was excellent, chatty, friendly, they knew the details of my reservation and offered to put our Wellington on straight away as it would take a long time.

I mean, if you've made it to 36 years old and never had a proper welly, it's got to be Gordon's classic dish or bust, right? My husband made reservations at Heddon Street for a late Saturday night dinner about a week before our long weekend in London. Night of, our table was ready when we arrived a few minutes early. We were promptly visited by a sommelier, who shortly thereafter delivered a beautiful Syrah. We enjoyed chatting with her the rest of the night as she checked in on us often to refill our glasses and ensure we were enjoying everything, including the wine. We couldn't decide on just one or two apps, so as is our MO, we over-ordered and got three. The turmeric chicken wings were my favorite of the three! So flavorful and crispy. The sauce was sticky and had the perfect sweet/savory balance I love so much. However the 'nduja filled gnocchi were a close, close second. The poor chips with truffle aioli would have been the star app anywhere else (they were quite tasty) but they paled in comparison to the wings and gnocchi. About 45-minutes after we placed the order (it takes some extra time for the wellington), the masterpiece arrived! Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. My mouth started watering the minute they put it down in front of us. Everything about the dish was just perfect. From the tender, salty beef to the warm, flaky pastry crust... Even the accoutrements were mind blowing. I mean, can we talk about the truffle mashed potatoes for a minute? How do they even make a bowl of potatoes taste so rich and earthy yet light and airy all at the same time?!? Sadly, after all of that food, we were way too full for dessert. Next time we visit (oh, there will be a next time!) we will skip an app or two and go for the sticky toffee pudding. Thank you Gordon Ramsay and team for such a wonderful night out and a life-changing first taste of Beef Wellington!",

    "text": "Very accessible walk from Piccadilly Circus tube stop, secluded in a quiet walking street, is Heddon Street Kitchen. Earlier in the day, I saw Gordon Ramsay post a brunch item, so thought this would be a great new spot to try for dinner. We were not disappointed!! Very friendly staff, chefs, made for a great night. Ordered my first ever Beef Wellington, and I enjoyed every bite! From the first taste to the last, it was very enjoyable. A friend ordered the duck, and he enjoyed it just the same. A cheeseburger was ordered for the younger guest, by the time I looked down to check it out, it was devoured. Wine selections complimented our meals, and the dessert bar upstairs was fantastic.Thank you to Ian (our waiter) and Dario (Head Chef) for a night I'll talk about for a long time! Only thing that would've made this visit better was to have had Gordon Ramsay walk in (but he didn't)",

    "text": "Whilst in London in April 2017, I made dinner reservations at Gordon Ramsay's Heddon Street Kitchen. My sole purpose was to finally try Gordon's infamous Beef Wellington and I must say, it was quite impressive. The presentation alone was an art piece and the cook of the meat as well as the outer crust was perfect. It's presented on wood cutting board and is served with a pinch of Sea salt, a bed of fresh greens and a cluster of tomatoes still on the vine. The Beef Wellington comes with a side of Brie mashed potatoes and a red wine jus. The dish takes about 45 minutes from ordering, so sit back and enjoy a nice glass of wine or a cocktail and relax. The dish is recommended for two people and they charge 40 pounds per person. The ambience is casual while maintaining an upscale appeal. Although it's not one of his three Michelin starred restaurants, it allows a Gordon Ramsay experience without breaking the bank. If you are visiting London, I highly recommend having dinner here and experiencing the Beef Wellington.",

That being said I was disappointed in the food at Heddon Street. I suppose if I wasn't spending the \u00a3 that I did I wouldn't be so upset. I actually can't remember the name of what I had, the pigs stomach that was deeply fried/crusted. I ate the crust which was delish and dessert saved me. The pros are, the restaurant and downtown area were primo! Absolutely cool 2 floor restaurant with outside patio seating and lil lap blankets for those cool nights. The staircase going to the upstairs seating is beautiful. The loo is quite nice too and I found a new brand of soap & lotion that I've since ordered online, Au Lait by The Scottish Fine Soaps Company. The waitress was very nice and it being 17 friends out for dinner AND it being a Friday night, the staff handled themselves all very well. I will say that my joy in going to a Ramsey restaurant far outweighed my disappointment in the food. I think I'm just not so into the more glamorous foods \u200d",

When we asked why we weren't getting the kids price they said \"because you didn't get a free kids meal\". \u00a0So if I ordered those free meals and just left them on the table untouched we could have gotten the ice cream for the kids price?!This is NOT the type of service we would expect from a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. \u00a0We bought the most expensive dish on the menu, wine, desserts, appetizers...I don't expect to be argued about 2 pounds when I'm spending 240 pounds for dinner. \u00a0Put a dark cloud over the night.",

Turns out they charged us for water and the waitress bought out extra wings when we said we did not want it. \u00a0Of course we told the staff and they quickly rectified the bill.Overall, a nice fancy restaurant with a bar bistro feel to it. Very pricey when you don't order from the set menu. \u00a0Will try other Gordon Ramsey establishments instead of returning here.",

    "text": "Having watched Gordon Ramsay for years, and after visiting Hell's Kitchen in Las Vegas (and loving it), I was excited to visit his Heddon St. Kitchen in London recently. \u00a0We were seated outside and ordered from the Thank Gord it's Summer set-menu. Our table had a small sofa on one side with chairs on the other. \u00a0Unfortunately the sofa had not been cleaned in the recent past and was covered in crumbs and other unidentifiable substances. Our table was also off-centre and wobbly. This was not rectified until we got up to exchange the table ourselves, as our waiter appeared disinterested in us. This was such a glaring difference from our experience at Hell's Kitchen, where our every need was anticipated - while relatively pleasant, or waiter did the bare minimum and answered our questions with 2-3 words, not offering recommendations or other information. \u00a0We had to flag someone down whenever we needed anything and even got up to get the water jug ourselves. The manager checked in with us early on when things were still OK, but we had to get up and go to him towards the end of our meal to express our concerns. Food wise, we all had the wing starter, which was tasty, but mine still had some feathers on them. I subsequently sent them back, and they were replaced with feather-free ones, but I got no explanation. The burgers were very good and cooked to our liking, but mine had a gluten free bun that had been over-microwaved, and was hard in spots (I thought GR didn't use microwaves)...I didn't bother to send it back, however, as we had been there for over an hour at this point. We added a couple servings of chips for the table and while they were cooked well and could have been a highlight, they were unseasoned and bland. We all tried different desserts, with the chocolate mousse and pineapple carpaccio getting high marks. I asked for the sticky toffee pudding, which tasted delicious, but again was microwaved - and crunchy in spots. The manager was receptive to our feedback and discounted our meal, but I left feeling disappointed in my London GR experience.",

Heddon street kitchen seemed to fit the bill. After years of watching Gordon Ramsay bully and berate chefs, aspiring chefs, restaurant owners and hotel owners on television, I must admit I was curious as to what to expect in one of his own kitchens.I'm not a fan of his onscreen personality (except his series when he was travelling across Asia), but I must admit that his kitchen (at this location) is well run.We ordered mostly seafood as my companions were pescatarians. The scallops and vegetarian flat bread were lovely. I'm not a fan of haddock, so I wasn't too thrilled with the asparagus and haddock, but they enjoyed it. Cod and halibut were ordered for mains, while I had a carpaccio of roast beef (first time I'm having a cooked beef carpaccio), it was lightly cooked, still red in the centre, and mostly meat. (I'm used to a lot of salad leaves with my carpaccio) But very delicious.The triple cooked fries were nice and crispy, but even I who eat very low salt food, felt they needed more salt. However, since we were busy talking we forgot to even ask for some ketchup to eat them with and they turned cold and got left on the table. We did however finish everything else that was served. We tried the sticky toffee pudding, crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate fondant for dessert and I have to give top marks to all of them.It's a great place to take guests out for a meal, with enough variety on the menu to suit multiple dietary requirements and very comfortable and scenic seating (we sat upstairs and had a very picturesque view of the street outside)",

So my family and I visited London and we are huge Gordon Ramsey fans so I went on a hunt trying to find which of his restaurants has good reviews as well as somewhat affordable pricing. This place caught my eye considering there were several main entrees for under 20 pounds. So I made a reservation for 4 in Open Table. We ordered the beef Wellington, which requires two people and costs 37.50 pounds per person. We also ordered the burger and the chicken. Everything was delicious. The chicken was moist and a huge serving. The burger was juicy and came with perfectly cooked French fries. The star of course was the beef Wellington. The beef was so tender and flavorful, surrounded with the delicious pastry. It came with this truffle mash potato that was addicting. My brother is a huge steak lover and this is by far the best he's ever had. My only complaint is that they charge for water. Really guys?!?",

The service was good as well. - Beef wellington - I was quite excited to have this but I found it quite heavy and extremely salty. The layer of puff pastry was quite thick, almost a pie crust, the mushroom duxelle lacked consistency, the beef was perfectly mid-rare, but because of the density of the dish, just weighed everything down.- Truffle mashed potatoes - This comes with the beef wellington. Deliciously creamy, truffle flavor permeating throughout, perfect mashed potatoes. Probably my favorite dish. - Kale salad - I'm so glad we got this, it helped freshen the heaviness of the wellington. - Sticky toffee pudding - Probably my favorite English dessert. Perfectly warm date cake and sweet, sticky, creamy topping. So good.Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by the beef wellington, which I was so excited about, but still a decent place to go!",

Biggest gripe was that I didn't even know who my server was because we had at least 5 different people come and take orders/check in on us. Food: here's where I was let down. Got the gnocchi and flatbread to start and they were pretty solid. For a main we did the Wellington for 2 and it was just bland. The cook was fine but it desperately needed to be seasoned. The pastry was falling off of the meat (I suspect because it is sliced into 6 pieces) and the filling was uneven. I have loved the Wellington in the past but this one was just not good and made me regret my decision. Toffee pudding for dessert was great. Ambiance: nice and pretty chic (but also casual). Music was kind of bad but not much to do about that. Overall, it was ok. There were some hits and misses with the meal, but for the total price I was REALLY disappointed.",

Right when we arrived, we received a friendly greeting and was seated promptly.For the food, I shared the beef Wellington with my GF. The beef was tender and cooked to perfection. The crust was also flaky and crunchy. The accompanying mashed potato was out of this world! My overall dining experience was amazing! Would come again the next time I am in London.",

    "text": "Our Gordon Ramsey obsession brought my husband and I to Heddon Street while visiting London this week and we were not disappointed.We dined late and we're lucky to get in without a reservation. The ambiance is relaxed but upscale and Impressive, we immediately knew we were in the right place. We split everything and went with the salt and pepper squid, njuda gnocchi, scallops, tortoloni, jersey potatoes, and sticky toffee pudding. Everything we ate was perfectly executed and up to the standards I would expect from an establishment baring the Ramsey name. I have a bit of a buratta obsession and fell in love with the buratta stuffed tortoloni, it was a to die for flavor combination that's not to be missed while visiting Heddon Street. The sticky toffee pudding was also unbelievable, by far one of the best desserts I've had in ages. Don't let them fool you with the Jersey potatoes and their \"unique\" presentation, they are delicious but simple roasted potatoes.Finally, service was all over the map. We had three servers throughout the evening. One was outstanding and the other two were fine. Despite that we loved Heddon Street and are glad it was our first introduction to Ramsey's restaurants.",

    "text": "Not sure what I expected but it was still a very nice night. We are big foodies and we had already eaten at another venue so my husband only wanted a dessert dish. I'm of course a huge slob so I got a starter and a small meal as well. I didn't like the questions about just having a dessert dish tho. Who cares what you eat! \u00a0I did enjoy the tuna tartar, in fact one of the best I've had anywhere.The venue is very nice.Also, minus on the dirty martinis. Small and zero dirty. Do they know how to make them outside of the US? Anyway, worth visiting :)",
