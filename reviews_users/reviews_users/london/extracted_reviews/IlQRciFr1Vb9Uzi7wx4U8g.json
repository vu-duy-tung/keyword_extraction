Where are the basil leaves? Spaghetti meatballs in my pho? Yea, no thanks. Soup doesnt have much flavor, only rescued by Sriracha. The Vietnamese coffee tasted like instant coffee with condense milk.Im giving two stars for the clean environment and the staff are quite nice. Definitely not coming back again.

We both love Vietnamese food and, having checked the menu, we eagerly entered.It was quiet when we got there, so the space, dominated by a brick wall and a long rugged wooden bench in the centre was very welcoming. We got a table for two and started to look at the menu, sensibly opting to share a starter - Chicken B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o, a delicious savoury Vietnamese crispy crepe with rice papers & herbs.I'd not had the crispy crepe and will admit I've not mastered rolling rice paper yet but it was all very tasty if a little messy!For main I plumped for Cm tm rang. A wonderful aromatic dish of spicy wok-fried broken rice with chicken & dried shrimp, a generous helping of that, with a dash of soy and the only challenge was my poor dexterity with chopsticks!Kirsty had the Chicken & Prawn Ph X\u00e0o. Wok fried flat rice noodles with lemongrass, chilli and Asian greens. Served with peanuts & nc chm I managed to snag a few bits of that too and it was as fresh and tasty as my dish.We also ordered a side of green veg (green beans and sugar snap peas topped with pan fried peanuts) which were ok. Oddly we were told they were out of peanuts, yet Kirsty's dish definitely had them?!Service was good, food was fresh and tasty and for an eatery in London it was reasonably priced, win all round!!",

Naturally, when I see a restaurant named Pho, I have high expectations. I have to say this chain is consistent and the noodles here are good, but not great. I find the beef noodle soup a bit on the light side. Though the soup is supposed to be clear, it should be full of flavor, which is a bit lacking here. However, it is so close to my flat, so it has become my go-to whenever I feel like a hot and spicy noodle soup to chase away the winter chill. Besides Pho, they also offer other popular dishes, like grilled meat on vermicelli noodles and stir-fry with rice. I have never tried those dishes, so I can't really comment on them. What I do like is their take out. Very thoughtful. The noodles and soup are packed separately, so the noodles won't get soggy. The container for noodles is like a proper noodle bowel, big and deep. You also get all the fixings in small packages. You can assemble your Pho whenever you are ready and your noodles will taste fresh.",

The broth here was actually quite good. The noodles were the wide variety which I usually don't care for much and rarely have I seen them in pho. The meat was good different but good. I would say it was a higher quality meat prepared with more culinary knowledge rather than family tradition Overall a solid place to eat and very clean.

It's a chain of Vietnamese restaurant that tries to go mainstream but I think is a complete fail.The food is pretty blend. I ordered the vermicelli noodles with spring rolls. The noodles were big fat ones not really vermicelli and also undercooked. The spring rolls had a really strong weird taste (maybe cause of the meat?). Fish sauce on the side was tasteless. Overall very disappointed by the food.Staff was ok, but only did their minimal duty. Maybe one waiter was actually Vietnamese...Bottom line is: save yourself some disappointment and go to Kingland's Road where you can find the best Vietnamese food in town.",

    "text": "I remember going to Pho many moons ago and not being very impressed - this was back when Vietnamese food was pretty new to me too, so I hadn't been back since. \u00a0It's undergone an extensive rebrand in the intervening period and after being recommended by a number of different people, I decided to give it another shot.This branch of pho is exactly how you'd imagine a slightly trendy-ish Vietnamese restaurant near Spitalfields. \u00a0To. A. Tee. \u00a0I bet there's one restaurant outfitters who have an Argos-type catalogue of settings and basically do every restaurant in London (this reminds me of the Northern Chinese restaurant on Lisle Street which had North African d\u00e9cor - I'm 90 % sure its predecessor was also Chinese, so I can only assume that that particular package was on offer. \u00a0This is totally and utterly unrelated to this review so I'll STFU now). \u00a0Pho goes for a fairly cosy feel (fairly dimly lit, obvs) despite the quasi-brutalist smooth concrete walls also found in House of Ho (remember, Vietnam IS a communist country after all). \u00a0I don't know if it's the walls, but as a result, the main room is pretty resonant so I'd have to work harder in conversation here than other places (albeit not as bad as the deafening bathroom acoustics of Cay Tre in Soho). \u00a0However, I am El Lobo Solitario. so no such problems this time round.I went for one of the large spring rolls and a Pho Tai Lan (the garlic variant) with an extra raw egg (mm, salmonella roulette). \u00a0I liked the spring rolls - not too greasy, crispy outside, and nice - if not overly flavourful- filling. \u00a0I would have liked a bit more variety in filling texture, but really it was a decent rendition with a good dipping sauce to boot. \u00a0I thought the pho had a good flavour, and compared favourably to a number of places on Kingsland Road. \u00a0The beef quality isn't the best, but the soup was pretty satisfying on the whole. \u00a0I don't get some of the complaints about here, it was nowhere near anything resembling bland and I'll be definitely returning in the future. \u00a0Being a bit upmarket, there aren't any options in the odd beef bits department (tendon, tripe), but that's fine. \u00a0It's not the most authentic in the world but then again it's not trying to be - if that's what you're looking for, go to any one of the numerous Viet places in Shoreditch. \u00a0However, I felt that pho does what it does pretty well. \u00a0I also had a Viet coffee - pretty good, although I felt it could be stronger, and it lacked the signature chocolate-ness of a really good one. \u00a0Still, the staff did manage to prepare it properly (no leaks here) unlike quite a few places. \u00a0House of Ho still do my favourite one in town, but this one suffices in a pinch.Overall, a good experience, plus the waiter returned my wallet which I'd left on the table. \u00a0Oops. \u00a0Extra tips then. \u00a0No complaints here and I think Pho's done a good job of pulling itself out of mediocrity.",

The menu is diverse and even if you aren't ordering pho, you still pick a winning dish. The pho comes with quite a lot of vegetables inside and a side tray of herbs to add, so in case the additional toppings to add confuse you, you will still get quite a lot of ingredients in your bowl. There are also a number of additional sauces you can add, however not all of them may be located on your table. We sat at a table for two and only had the sriracha and the fish sauce. We had to ask another table for their in house made sauces, which I would recommend highly.",

For starters, we picked out the Mc chi\u00ean gi\u00f2n (fried baby squid) (please don't ask me how to pronounce it) and C\u00e1nh g\u00e0 (seasoned crispy chicken wings with sriracha dip). And THEY WERE AMAZING. The wings were wonderfully seasoned and meaty, and the squid was just wonderful. I was completely sold on Pho by the starters alone, to be honest.The pho main course itself was pretty huge and very tasty. I chose the Prawn pho with chicken broth, and it was lovely and flavoursome - full of soft, well-cooked noodles. I did struggle with eating it slightly until I had my technique in check though... The portion size was very generous and I ended up taking some home with me - Pho also have a takeout counter upstairs so you can grab some on the go.The service was great too - despite having a sore throat and basically having lost her voice, our server was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was pretty lively on a Friday night, but we got a table immediately and were served quickly.I'm totally sold on Pho and will definitely be heading back very soon. PHO YES.",

I already had expectations that it would probably be hard to find authentic vietnamese food here, and this place was the closest my boyfriend and I found around the area where we were at. I had the Pho Bo (beef) Xao. When I got my plate, I had no clue why there were cold bean sprouts and fish sauce on one side so I found that odd. Don't get me wrong, the food was good and I was content, but of course it's nothing like vietnamese food back home in California. I would highly recommend making a trip to California, either the Bay Area, specifically San Jose, or Los Angeles for real authentic vietnamese food! Other than that, the service was great! And you get a postcard to take home if you're a tourist.",

I did a Yelp search from my desk and noticed that this restaurant was within walking distance and had a good rating.It was certainly a popular day for pho! The line of people seeking Vietnamese was almost out of the door. The winter air was crisp and we were keen to access the restaurant proper and get our fill.The pho was delicious and I was satisfied in just the way I wanted. The first spoonful of the broth was moreish. I scooped several more full spoons of broth down before I started on the noodles and beef. The noodles were cooked just right (a little firm, as I prefer) and the beef was tasty.I finished the broth. All of it. To the last spoonful.I think this is a pho restaurant for newcomers to pho. The menu has helpful comments about the dishes so you know what to expect. The waitress asked me if I had had pho before, when she dropped off the pho with the side dish of leaves and lime. For a newcomer, I think she may have given some friendly advice about how to tackle the pho.This is a bankable Vietnamese restaurant near work and I expect that I will be back again this winter.",
