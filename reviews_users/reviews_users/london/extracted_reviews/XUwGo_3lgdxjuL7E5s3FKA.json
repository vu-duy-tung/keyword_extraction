We were seated, then when we asked to change for the dessert menus instead the waiter had to go and ask the manager if it was ok, he came back and told us that it was'nt ok. So we just got up and left. We couldn't just have dessert/coffee or dessert wine? Why not? Probably because the manager was on a power trip and too greedy! Shame, we will never go back!au revoir Pierre V...",

Last week we went early as we were going to the theatre. They have a very good value for money set menu if you order before 6.30 pm. It is only \u00a38.90 for two courses with supplements for some of the more expensive dishes - with drinks it came to just under \u00a320 per person and the food was lovely. The staff were good though a little quick at asking for more wine - one had just overfilled our glasses in the attempt to empty the bottle and then asked if we wanted another one. Not Yet, please! The wine list is good though and the prices are very reasonable.In the evening a guy comes along to play the piano, which is a really nice touch. The restaurant is quite small and gets really busy because it is so popular. There is a nice buzz but I don't think it would be the best place to go on a first/romantic date. Otherwise I would recommend it to everyone.",

As I said, I recommend their bavette steak w/ red wine, shallots and fries for \u00a310.90. They also boast a fantastic wine and beer selection. Pierre Victoire is definitely THE place to go on a romantic date. Two main courses and a bottle of red will run you about \u00a340--not a bad deal for the quality of both their food and service.

    "text": "Pierre Victoire is a fantastic gem in the heart of london's bustling SOHO neighborhood. I've been a regular customer here since I moved to London 3 years ago and my experience is always top notch. Even on the occasions where something has gone slightly awry, the head maitre-de always makes up for it...but more on that later.This is an ideal place for a first or second date, or an intimate party amongst friends and families. The decor is rustic and simple. Mixed candles and a choice bottle of wine on each of the bare wooden tables are offset \u00a0by white walls adorned with local artwork (for sale). \u00a0And If you're lucky enough to get a table on a saturday night your food will be accompanied by the sweet sounds of their resident piano player. It's all very French.The food is fantastic - i've tried just about everything on the menu and my recommendations are: the duck, which comes with dauphinoise potatoes, bok choi and a delicious asian marinade; the tuna steak; accompanied with legumes and pan fried chorizo, and the steak frites with their signature cream sauce (get it on the side as its very rich). Best of all, all of these aforementioned options are under 15 pounds! When you're dining in the heart of London, this is a very rare thing to come across. If you're hungry enough to attempt either starters, desserts or both, i've got a couple of recommendations here too: for starters - the scallops, steak carpaccio or the mussels - you simply cannot go wrong with any of these! For dessert - the banofee pie wins me over every time.The house wine is very good. They offer 2 house options (lighter/heavier) for both red and white which is a nice touch. The italian house red is my favorite...I know, controversial in a French restaurant! It has a velvety texture with jammy undertones and notes of plum and spice. Best of all, it wont leave you gasping for water or rubbing your temples after the bottle is finished. Alternatively, if you can move up to the pricier options, they've got some fantastic Cabernet Savignon's and merlots on the menu as well. The service can be interesting at times but there is salvation. There are a few clueless looking waitresses on the premises, but the head maitre-de more that makes up for what those gals lack. He's extremely friendly and will always bend over backwards to make sure your visit is the best. I was dining there on a very busy Thursday night. There were 3 of us in my party and we were sitting at a 4 person table. A family of 4 walked in and there were no spare tables big enough to place them at, so Mr Maitre-de came over and very apologetically asked if we wouldn't mind moving to a smaller table. We literally hadn't even had a sip of wine yet so it was totally fine. He felt so bad, however, \u00a0that he bought us our bottle of wine and insisted that we each have a glass of amaretto on the house after our meals. Excellent service! I'm all about treating customers well and this more than made up for us having to trek 4 feet away to a slightly smaller table. Thank you sir!! I think i've made my point here...Pierre Victoire is a rare find in London. The city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants but if you want simple, delicious and unpretentious cooking in a cozy environment with a price tag that wont have you sweating steak frites in your sleep, head over to Pierre Victoire.....you'll definitely find me there.",

There used to be a whole plethora of Pierre Victiure restaurants throughout the south east, serving good French bistro food at incredible value - around \u00a37 for a 2 course lunchThe chain went bankrupt but somehow this place still survives, keeping the original green waning. It has continued the best traditions of the chain with lunch set menus at \u00a37.90 and dinner set menus at \u00a39.90The menu does look a little more international these days with dishes like Polish pierogi and Armenian lamb bosbash augmenting French classicsThe cooking is rustic, hearty and filling but very correct in the casual way that good French bistros pull off effortlesslyAllez, Pierre Victoire!",

And I'm pleased to say, we were not disappointed! The staff here are amazing. Nothing was too much trouble and they were attentive and helpful to the end. We had a table of 16, taking up most of the basement and I have to say that after seeing the packed ground floor, I actually preferred the intimate basement as it was quieter and better for a large group. The starter of halloumi and beetroot salad was scrumptious a very decent portion (as was the ginormous affogato at the end of our meal - the biggest I've ever seen!). I replaced my frites for mash with my main of steak bavette, was served in a red wine jus with onion and it was delicious (the meat wasn't as melt-in-the-mouth as my friend who opted for the more expensive Steak Frites; my choice next time...). It was a shame that the set menu (2 courses for \u00a39.90) finished at 7pm as that really made it a great option for those on a budget. Top marks for the house red wine - fantastique! I will definitely be coming back. Thanks for a great night!",

This location survived the group going bust, the loyal customers coming back again and again.Just like its sister restaurant Prix Fixe, they offer set-price menus for lunch and up until 7pm, represent ridiculous value for money. The service can be very French at times, but that's to be expected.Unusually, and even more surprising given the price, you can get a very good steak here for just \u00a315. Mine was cooked to perfection.",

Particularly if you'd find the old dude playing the piano entertainingThe food was good, particularly the 'escargot-style' mussels and the chocolate mousse dessert, and was very reasonably priced for a good restaurant in Soho. Overall the bill was \u00a330 each for 3 courses and wine.The atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty lively generally, but we were downstairs where it was a bit quieter.

We went here a Tuesday night - 3 courses for 12 pounds before 7:00 pm, which we thought was a very good price compared to other London restaurants.The ambience here was quite lovely with dripping candles on the tables; and we were even spoiled with live piano playing during our dinner.Now, regarding the food: The menu (it changes from week to week, apparently!) was really exciting in its variety, and we had trouble even choosing. We finally came down with seafood soup, smoked salmon & prawn roulades, thai fish cakes, Beef Bourguignon, and sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Everything was great, lots of different tastes and very good, attentive service throughout. The only thing that can be criticized a bit was the tempo in which the courses was served; we had had all of our courses within 1,5 hour, which felt a tiny bit too fast. But everything else was spot on and we would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a cozy night out with excellent food for a good price to head for Pierre Victorie!",

    "text": "I've been to Pierre Victoire a couple of times for their cheap and cheerful early bird menu. Being in central London, just around the corner from Soho Square, it's great for dining at before you head out for the night when eating isn't particularly the main priority. If you order before 7pm from the selected choices two courses are only \u00a0\u00a39.90. Bargain! If you pay a \u00a33 or \u00a36 supplement you can incorporate most of the premium dishes from their affordable French menu into your deal, such as the steak that is consistently good, or the sea bass (the quality of their sea food is also another good surprise for such a reasonable price). Their cheap wine list is OK, nothing that your tastebuds will fall in love with, but it doesn't taste like paint stripper either so It will do just fine. Although you don't have one waiter assigned to your table, so you miss out on an intimate service, it does mean a quick turnaround that is convenient for lunch in an hour, and at \u00a37.90 for two courses from the lunch time menu, it wont break the bank either. As my city friend describes it: \"A credit-crunch, power lunch.\" There's always a buzzy atmosphere, constantly topped up with more hungry customers who are conscious of their purse strings. They do add a 12% service charge that seems a little sneaky since as their selling point is a two course meal for under a tenner, but I guess it's only fair. Just be careful that you don't miss this and end up tipping twice.",

Going with my fussy eater mother she was tempted in by the advertised two course menu for \u00c2\u00a39.99 which included steak and frites. We should have reported the owners to trade descriptions because once inside reading the confusing, badly copied, handwritten mess that is the menu we realised that all the steaks and some of the other meat courses all had a supplementary \u00c2\u00a35 charge, which is a bit cheeky. Still, we stayed. The snotty waitress eventually came and took our order, the wine was good and reasonably priced. My lamb was tremendous and my mother enjoyed her steak and frites. She had coffee after and as a culinary treat it was okay. So why the three stars. Mainly the menu, it is a mess, but also the service was appalling. Too much attitude not enough manners. I know a good waiter should never be seen but that only applies to when serving, surely they could be more forthcoming and helpful upon arrival, especially in such a tourist trap area!",

Not sure the beet root was needed. Overall, an ok but not very special dish. But the mains were very good. Roasted seabass fillets were served on thick slices of potato and came with one stuffed calamari. The standout of this dish was oddly the pieces of beet root! Delicious.

The set menu for lunch is really cheap as you can get a whole 2 course meal for around \u00a38 and a 3 course for \u00a311. The quality of the food is impeccable. I mean, I loved it, but my French friend also commended it. If a proper 2 course lunch wouldn't make me too sleepy to go back to work \"fully operational\" I would likely have lunch here every weekday :)",

Start with an appetiser: the mussels or the escargot in a garlic sauce. Finish that with bread. Have some wine. This place offers an intimate setting, candle-lit with quiet jazzy music in the backdrop. You won't be waiting for the meal... You'll be munching on their delicious bread!",

Thankfully, when I asked for them they promptly gave us our required cracker each, otherwise how could it be a Christmas dinner?!The food itself was pretty good, however the setting was more cramped than cosy (we were sitting in a corner downstairs).I don't think I'll try this place again, but perhaps the experience would be different if it was just a meal for two.",

    "text": "I am glad I am not the only one who finds this so called 'gem' of a restaurant to be disappointing. Living in SE and working somewhere near Old Street I don't often frequent Soho for dinner or drinks but I had heard great things about Pierre Victoire. We went here for a friends birthday dinner and I just wasn't impressed. The place is tiny so all night you had people pushing past you and you practically had to climb out of your chair to go to the toilet. We had booked for a fairly big group so I put this down to that. However, we all ordered our mains with a few people ordering starters. The starters came, they were fine, the food was in fact quite tasty. Then came the mains, well all of them except one. Out of a group of 9, most of whom ordered full mains of cooked food, one girl ordered a salad, For some reason this was too difficult for the kitchen and it took nearly an hour (after everyone else had received their food) for her salad (yes salad) to come. The apologies were not particularly heartfelt and when it finally arrived it was sort of thrown in her direction. By this point she was quite upset considering everyone else had finished their food (after waiting as long as we could). We then went to order desserts..and were told that we only had 10 minutes before we had to leave our table as it had been booked by someone else so could we hurry up if we wanted desserts. We couldn't believe it. Putting aside the fact that a 2 hour limit was never communicated to us on booking the table, they had taken over an hour to bring a salad. Needless to say we paid the bill minus the service charge and left the restaurant only to be chased down the street by a waiter demanding we pay the service charge! We explained that we didn't feel the service was good enough and it wasn't until they fetched a manager that we were able to get them to understand. After all that we weren't even offered an apology. Basically it was an awful experience and one I don't want to repeat. Even if it was a one off I doubt i'll ever be going back here again which is a shame as actually the food was delicious!",

    "text": "My friend who is really good at picking restaurants picked this one for our little gathering. The price sounded right. Before 7pm you can get a 2-course meal for under \u00a310 but even if you arent able to make it on time, a main is between \u00a310 - \u00a314.Unfortunately the food more than reflected its price. Every dish we got tasted like it came out of a high school cafeteria. My ribeye and mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a paper package. The rare seared tuna steak was overcooked, thinly sliced, and tasted like it was on a tangy hot sauce and a bed of hot dogs that were supposed to be chorizo.Dessert was good. The seasonal fruit crumble was well cinnamoned while a taste of the tiramisu, creme brulee and coffee pudding left me satisfied.The best part about the restaurant is that it takes reservations despite being ultra busy. The atmosphere was wonderful too, with candles lit in the bottles and a piano played by someone working for the restaurant.Maybe I'm not ordering the right food, or maybe if I come back before 7pm, i'll feel like the food taste better (when it's cheaper). But I was very disappointed last night.",

    "text": "Got in here without a reservation! A French restaurant on Dean Street. Walked in with supreme scepticism. Ok, so worst, we'd break a baguette and butter it up. Let's look at the menu ... oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! \u00a312 set menu?!?! I'm sorry, am I not in the overpriced West End? My foie will cost \u00a312 one block over on Frith Street! As the scepticism increased (maybe they were in fact going to serve us buttered up baguette?), our waiter escorted us to a six seater in the middle of the downstairs dining area. Wooden tables teeming on the wooden floor with low lighting mainly from the candles that adorned the tables; almost sticking to each other with very little room to manoeuvre your physical self. Ouch. But very cosy. Just remember, a \u00a312 menu which hasn't been outright slammed in any of the seemingly effortfully written reviews.The baguette did come in, only not buttered, but accompanied with little packets of butter. Mussels, mackerel, onion soup, mushrooms; so a fairly well balanced range of starters. We shared 3 carafes of reasonably priced house wine. I've had superbly cooked steak here, and slow cooked lamb, and both were above average. The menu changes from time to time, so you can always go back for new stuff on the menu. It'll be hard to find serious issues with the food, and for the price, location and the overall experience, I would award this place four stars.The fine print at the bottom of the menu will tell you that you will pay an additional 15% service.",

    "text": "Zut Alors! How have I only just discovered this place?Until recently, the only French cuisine I had ever sampled had been baguettes, croissants and pain au chocolats. I'm a regular in the Soho area and thought I had tried all the best restaurants in the area until my recent visit to Pierre Victoire. The interior was stereotypically everything I expected it to be, which I loved. The rustic decor, the wine bottle candles and french memorabilia; all of this along with the low lighting and french music added to the warm and ambient atmosphere. The bistro has great set menus if you are on a budget, but since I was here for a special occasion a little bit of indulgence was required. I started off with the escargot-style grilled mussels in garlic, parsley and Pernod butter with bread crumbs. I wasn't a big fan of mussels until recently and they were delicious. My main course was one of the best I have ever had; confit of duck with dauphinoise potatoes, garlic fine beans and green peppercorn cream. Despite parts of the duck being a bit more chewy that i'd like, overall simply exquisite.To drink, what else would you have in a French restaurant but of course wine! We started with a bottle of Ca'Lunghetta Pinot Grigio Blush and moved on to a bottle of Merlot Ros\u00e9. Everyone agreed that the food was delicious and the menus are extensive enough to suit any budget. With a very central and easily accessible location this gem of a restaurant is unfortunately no longer a hidden treasure.I staggered home after one too many glasses of wine after having a very enjoyable evening and will definitely be visiting again.",

Candles on all table, low light otherwise, it creates a nice cozy atmosphere. The decoration brings back French souvenirs from the 1920's with posters and paintings on the walls.All in all, I'd recommend it.",

They had a 2-course or 3-three course set menu for \u00a314.90 or \u00a317.90, respectively. I went with the latter.Had the butternut squash soup, the Conchiglie summer pasta, and creme brulee. I also tried the steamed mussels in white wine and couldn't decide whether I liked that broth more or the soup.

It was in turn recommended to her by her sixth form French teacher.I hear it used to be a chain but doesn't feel like it. In fact it reminded me so much of a place called 'Bistrot Victoires' in Paris that I had a hard time believing we were still in London and on Dean Street of all places!The menu here is very reasonably priced and the pre-theatre and lunch sets are out of this world value for money. Something to keep in mind next time you're running to Pizza Express before catching a show. My friend and I ordered a la carte though and neither of us regretted our choices. She ordered seabass which was beautifully cooked and I had a bavette steak (so rare to find in the UK) with frites. We shared a side of green beans. Everything was excellent and the food arrived really quickly despite the fact the place was packed to the brim.Dessert was delicious too but not quite as inspired as our mains. I had a simple affogato and my friend ordered a banoffee pie. It would have been nice to see something a little more in keeping with the rest of the menu but no complaints other than that.Mains, desserts, a carafe of wine plus some post-dinner coffee/tea came to about \u00a365 for two of us including service. Will definitely visit again. A great experience. Very happy to that it's now on my radar!",

I came in with a group of 4 and we all tried different appetizers and entrees, I honestly cannot think of a single bad thing about any plate. The waitstaff and chef were so very thoughtful. When we told them it would be our last meal before our flight back to New York, they were kind enough to seat us by the window, rush our orders and provide us with complimentary Proseccos. A+ all around!",

    "text": "My husband and I had a really disappointing experience here last night (thanks TimeOut voucher =/).It started off well: the place was bustling when we got there at 7pm but as we had a rez, we got a table (with the piano to my back) near the entrance straightaway. We got our menus and one of the staff (four were on last night) let me substitute a glass of white wine for the prosecco (as part of the voucher). Warm French baguette bread came out shortly. And then, this is where it mostly goes downhill. I ordered the beetroot cream cheese as a starter and my husband the pork shoulder croquette. For mains, I ordered the Roast Cauliflower and hazelnut carbonara with parmesan and parsley and my husband the Chargrilled Entrecote steak with homemade frites, crispy cos and rocket salad & maitre d butter.And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.Finally, our apps arrived and the cream cheese platter had a delightful presentation and tasted just as phenomenal. Explosive hints of butter and garlic and honey and OMGGGG so good. My husband said his croquette was middling.Then we waited again. And some more. Then the two tables that sat down AFTER us got their food. And finished their food. And we were STILL WAITING 20 minutes later for our mains.At this point, I nearly walked out.An hour and 20 minutes after we were sat and our orders had been taken and we got our food... and it was tasteless. The pasta looked amazing but was one of the worst I have ever had- completely bland. The meek, scant cauliflower and hazelnuts scatterings couldn't help it at all. Similarly, my husband said his was pretty flavourless as well. I made sure we got the oh-so-stupid gratuity all London restaurants add of 12.5% removed and we left in disgust. The only somewhat saving grace was the waitstaff were all very apologetic, explaining there were only 2 cooks on staff that night. Still, TRULY good customer service (which only happens in the US of course, so silly of me to expect) would have removed the charge for the extra glass of wine I had and/or the 6 pound supplement charge for my husband's steak.I gave my leftover pasta to a homeless person; maybe he would have enjoyed it more!",

I particular liked my starter -- it was fresh and very flavourful. My main was also good, though I felt like my mussels weren't 100% fresh. Ambience was great -- very cozy and French. Service was prompt as well.Would definitely go back for the great food at very reasonable prices!",

We received prompt, \u00a0service, actually it seemed a bit rushed but was friendly and attentive.We enjoyed a bubbly prosecco and a starter of steamed mussels in meuniere sauce which were succulent! Our main consisted of piquant, moist cod steamed in parchment infused with a delightful assortment of flavorful spices and herbs, we detected ginger, green onion, red pepper and lemongrass! The raspberry creme brulee and chocolate mousse was decadently delicious!Intimate and romantic, it's a great place to go on date night!",

    "text": "This is a very good value, French-style restaurant, which also caters pretty well for vegetarians.The restaurant itself is rather cosy with an unpretentious, lived-in feel - tables are quite close together, the wooden furniture is second-hand - but not exactly shabby chic. It's very different from the usual Soho joint, and all the better for it. There's a cosy downstairs area as well.As others have said, the set menus - which offer over half a dozen choices of starters and mains - are excellent value for the area. Even the a la carte is not bad, given the quality of the food. Friends who had steaks and the ox cheek were delighted by both quality and quantity - they cook the steaks as you wish - although serving frites in a jar in the modern style doesn't add anything in my view. I had falafel to start and mushroom pappardelle , followed by sticky toffee pudding.Service is efficient and unfussy. One tip - the lighting is very subdued and, while this lends a romantic air, in the evening take a phone with a torch facility!A real find in the area.",

My friends had the mussels as a starter and enjoyed them. The candle burning atop an old wine bottle adds a nice touch to the atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and seemed eager to please. A very pleasurable dining experience.Post Script. I was persuaded to have dessert. After agonizing over an amazing array of scrumptious options, I chose the Banoffee Pie. I wasn't disappointed. You won't be either. AND THEN... the pimple faced kid with the impossibly thick accent who was just serving food sits down at the piano an starts \"playing around\" tickling the ivory while chatting with a waitress. Smooth move kid. Impressively unexpected piano skills.BONUS POINTS!",

The ambience is standard French bistro and is no more crowded together than one would expect. The food was well cooked and well presented. The portion size was generous. The bread was fresh - often a good test of a bistro - and again generous.We booked a table for 3 at 8.00pm on a Tuesday. We were seated on time, and while we were there the restaurant was almost full the entire time. Service was courteous and were helpful with one of the party who had dietary needs, and food delivery and clearing were on point: not too quick or slow.Starter and main with one large glass of house red wine each for three and coffee was \u00a395 including 12.5% service charge, and I would eat there again tonight without a qualm.

    "text": "Went there for the first time on Valentine's Day. A 3-course set menu was given on the day, and we ordered baby squid with risotto, mussels cooked in escargot style as appetisers, ribeye steak and duck breast for mains, and sticky toffee pudding and banoffee pie to end the meal. The appetisers were a very nice surprise because the plating was fantastic, let alone the freshness of the squid and creamy yet light risotto. The mussels were tiny but very cutely snuggled in a escargot dish, the flavours were so nice we ordered an extra serving of bread to dip in all the sauces! Ribeye steak was rustic with a hint of chargrilled burntness and it was tender and juicy. Duck breast was a little dry on the edge cuts, but the accompanied relish and dauphinoise potatoes made up for it. Sticky toffee pudding was remarkably lovely with a hot melt-in-mouth toffee centre, but I wish the ice cream was served in a cold container so it wouldn't melt so quickly on the hot plate. Banoffee pie was sadly not what I expected with a thick layer of cream and little chocolate shavings on top, there was not enough caramel with a very thin pie and the bananas were in wholes. The overall texture was more like a banana boat than a banoffee pie.The set dinner was very reasonably priced, speed of service was slow and it was a bit o fa wait on the appetiser (approx. half an hour). The atmosphere however was vibrant and cosy, especially with hearty decorations for Valentine's day. We sat next to the entrance but it was rather packed, so the cold breeze every now and then wasn't too bad (would of course prefer other seating if we had a choice). Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who fancies an intimate French meal!",
