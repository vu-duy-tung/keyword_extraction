The beers on tap are Meantime Brewery (always nice to support the local goods) and the food is reliably good. My favorite menu item is definitely the burger (even the bun is good!), albeit a tiny bit overcooked but generously portioned and with homemade condiments and chips. My only disappointments are the small menu (wish they had a few more classic pub items as I'm sure they'd be great at it) and the Sunday roast - its OK, but like a lot of pubs serve thin slices of beef that aren't as rare as I'd like. Overall great for a drink or snack and in nice weather has a lovely small garden out back!",

    "text": "My visit to the Greenwich Union was a spur of the moment encounter having met friends locally and trying after their recommendation. Set along a quaint street with a historical setting the ambiance in the area is second to none. The selection of ales and beers is fantastic, with something for every palette to enjoy. Turning to the the menu i found it to be pretty standard but solid. I tried the fish and chips with the cod being fresh and light but the batter - a crucial part - was crisp but, i felt, a little lacking in the depth of taste. The chips were firm, thankfully missing the ubiquitous London grease and exploding with a fluffy potato interior. Kudos. A friend had his order mixed up and the manager was superior in his customer service qualities both apologising, getting the appropriate dish out to him quickly and going beyond by giving him a free drink. Good job mr manager. The casks are professionally kept, the kitchen is solid and efficient but all the time I had a nagging sensation that the space begged for a more imaginative and perhaps authentic revamp. The Union is run in ship-shape fashion offering a high quality experience and with a level of service that the locals clearly lap up but it lacks a certain imagination to mark it out as a marque London pub.",

    "text": "This is the best pub in London. Well, OK I might have trouble proving that, but it's my local and I adore it. To give you an idea of how much I adore it, I should tell you that i live on the other side of Greenwich and have to get on a train to get here. But it's worth it. For a start, it's so untouched. It's a bit off the beaten track and you'll have a hard job finding it if no one has told you about it. This is a really amazing quality in a pub in Greenwich. Sure, it's busy at the weekends but it's busy with locals. And big fluffy dogs too. Cute. The bar staff are firendly and hot. All of them. They're happy to see me when I come in. They've never once siad anyhing when I've got too drunk at the bar. (It doesn't happen often I promise.) They let me eat ice cream in here while I drink beer. I don't need to bring my own ice cream though, the food here is great. It could be described as gastro pub food, but they source all their stuff locally and it's yummy. The do brinch as well. Their Sunday lunches are pretty good too. If a tad pretty looking when what you really want is more roasties. They also brew their own beer. Meantime Brewery is pretty well known south of the river and it's well worth discovering. Though I'm allergic to raspberries so I've never tried that flavour. Their wheat beer tastes of banana milkshake. (I'm a smoker, this may just be my messed up taste buds!) I absolutley can't say anything bad about it in here. there's a beer garden out the back and I've given myself pretty awful sunburn because I just didn't want to leave. It's so gorgeous in here. The whole pub makes me happy. It's got everything a local should have. Except a cat. Maybe it should have a cat.",

    "text": "Greenwich is a wonderful place to go to on a Sunday, to have a look around the market, take a walk through the park, and of course grab a beer and maybe a pub lunch, and The Union is the best place for it. It's a traditional English pub, but with an airy modern twist that makes it an attractive summer option, as well as somewhere to huddle in the winter. The garden is also great when it's sunny.The pub is the Meantime Brewing Company's first official home and serves no national beers, only its own products including fruit beers, pale ale and wheat beer. I'm a fan of the raspberry, and that's from someone who doesn't normally like beer.The food menu is traditional English fare, done to a solid, quality standard at reasonable but not cheap prices.This is a great place to visit after a walk, for an evening with friends, or just an afternoon alone reading. The beers alone are worth it.",

    "text": "The pub we decided to settle in for lunch was The Greenwich Union. The Greenwich Union is one of four pubs along Royal Hill \u00a0they are all pretty much in a row, but most if not all do great business and each seems to have its own vibe and particular atmosphere \u00a0there is something for everyone.In any case before we tackle the roast lets go back to the pub itself, its housed in what looks like a traditional pub and inside is also very traditional with lots of wood however the back part of the pub opens out into a light and airey conservatory with booth seats, further on is the beer garden. The music going on in the back ground is just at the right level for you to be aware of it and to hum along to your fav tunes but not too loud that you cant hear yourself or anyone else speak.It wasnt too busy which was great, though was largely because we went quite early it would soon fill up. We sat in one of the booth seats.On offer was a Vege option and Beef, Lamb and Pork the cost of each was \u00a312.20 (the Vege option was cheaper). I love it when a pub separates out its roast menu \u00a0it makes it feel a little more special and shows that on a week on week basis it could change depending on whats available.I settled for the Beef and my other half on the Pork. Before I could get to the bar to order one of the staff came up and asked if we wanted anything and were keen to please always a good sign.InsideThe food arrived really quickly \u00a0probably within 10 minutes if that \u00a0maybe a little soon for my liking, surely some of the joy in eating food is the anticipation of it..anywaySo once it arrived what did we get for our money:Meat: Beef in slices a generous portion \\ Pork was the same in slices with cracking but a generous portionVeg: A large roasted carrot, green beans and red cabbage (a nice and different touch!)Potatoes: Roasted 2 largeOther: Large yorkshire pudding, Gravy (made with Meantimes own London Stout), horseraddish sauce for the Beef and Apple sauce for the Pork in a separate dish.Heres the roastIt was very attractively presented and hot, I loved the fact their yorkshire puddings were home made and werent some uniformed Aunt Bessies \u00a0though it was a little too crunchy for my liking. On the reverse the potatoes were large but not quite crispy enough. The red cabbage was a nice touch \u00a0always nice to see different veg, and being lightly pickled it added a different taste sensation when combined with the meat or the potatoes. The gravy was rich and using London Stout again brought it to a different level \u00a0would have been nice to have more of it though!All in all a nice roast \u00a0it goes to the top of the leader board.Here are the ratingsMeat 4.5/5Veg 4/5Potatoes 3/5Gravy 4/5Other (ie yorkshire pudds) 3/5Service 4/5Value for money 3.5/5 (possibly just a little overpriced)Total 26/35View Larger Map",

Initially mistaking this pub for part of the University bar was an easy error to make in name, but upon seeing the actual pub it soon becomes clear that the connection ends there. The pub plays host to a series of it's own varied beers. Definitely a place worth visiting if you'd like to see that Greenwich isn't just confined to the surroundings of the market square. Saving the best for last, on my most recent visit there I was very pleased to discover that they sell a very tasty bottled ciderI unfortunately forget it's name, but if you ask for the sweet bottled cider I'm sure they will know the stuff. Definitely worth a try if you like your libations apple based!",

This is by far the best food we had on our trip, coupled with the friendliest service. No offense, but Londoners don't seem to smile much. Not true here. I found the Union in a London with Kids guide. It's a bit off the tourist track, about a 15 minute walk from the park, but well worth it. The food was excellent- fresh fish perfectly cooked, and those potato patty things were crazy good! In fact we came back here 2 more times even though it meant a long boat trip down the Thames.Great for kids, if yours are fairly obedient anyway. We found that most restaurants discourage children, if not forbid them outright. True, we saw a lot of bratty British kids (what's with that?) but our daughters are well behaved and enjoy good food, not McDonald's. The Union welcomed us with open arms. The girls loved the cat in the garden out back, and we couldn't get enough of their delicious beer- we tried almost everything! It's been two and a half years but I still remember this place fondly, and have recommended it to my British friends and relations. Go there now and have a pint for me!",

Two guys, just weren't enough to keep up with demand on the sunny weekend we went there. So long waits were a feature. Also, the bar is split in two, and they only seemed interested in serving one end. How about one bar tender on each side? Really, it makes sense. But that isn't why I'm writing this. I really wanted to warn about the food. We had a selection of bar snacks, hummus dip, black pudding, chorizo and fish sticks. The fish was pretty decent, so no complaints there other than the fact they ran out of condiments. As the ketchup bottles were empty (but still out), I asked if there was any more. I was unapologetically told they had run out. The black pudding was charred to a crisp, the hummus tasted only of lemon. The presentation was great, but the rest was poor.",

My personal favourite of their beers is the Yakima Red.It's a relaxed place, this. No pretense to be found.The food is very good. I enjoyed their burger a lot. If I hadn't been sporting a hangover and no doubt slightly worse for wear after a very enjoyable brewery tour, I might have been more adventurous with my choice, as there is a lot to choose from.

The pub had football on one screen when we arrived, but the commentary was turned down so that it wasn't intrusive. As more patrons arrived, we were asked if we minded having another screen switched on (but again without sound) - no problem.

I did some pre-research and wrote down a few pub names. This one is a little off the beaten tourist path by a few blocks, but was nonetheless packed -- a good sign, since they were likely all locals. We had a 15 minute wait - not problem, and a little mix up that the people before us got seated first. But the waiter was profusely apologetic so no harm done.We were with a toddler and they were able to bring food for him right away - the pigs in a blanket (mini sausages wrapped in bacon - so amazing), and a side of perfectly good chips. Husband had the roast beef roast. I had the vegetarian roast. Both came on a bed of roasted veggies and some greens, drizzled in gravy and a yorkshire pudding. Husband thought the roast beef was exceptional. I was literally in heaven with my veggie cheese tart and accoutrements. It's so rare to find a good vegetarian roast. Every mouthful was delectable. The one weakness was the yorkshire pudding, which was pretty dry and crunchy. I like some breadiness there for sopping up the gravy. I would return here in a second. Wish i'd found a similar place in the city.",

    "text": "I Yelp for a reason. I use Yelp and therefore, feel it's my duty to give back what I have taken. The Greenwich Union is a perfect example of this.On the weekend my partner in crime (and fun times) and I went on a cycling adventure to Greenwich from our home in Stoke Newington. We had a few things planned along the way but by 1pm we'd hit Greenwich and were starving. Using my trusty Yely app, I hunted for a pub with an outside space and The Greenwich Union came up. Wonderful! So after really enjoying myself, I just had to leave a review...The Greenwich Union serves up a selection of local Meantime beers and have recently taken Brewdog on tap too. They have specials that change daily and really wonderful British pub food - you may even dare to call it a gastropub (you crazy Americans you). The portions are huge and the service is pretty decent too.As always, I ordered a Bloody Mary and was suprised at how well made it was. Kind of spicy and then I could add more if needed - I love it when they let you add extra bits without judging. And there really was no judgment on the amount of Tabasco I splashed in. As for the dining space, it was lovely, they have a little patio with neat little tables outside, loads in fact. They also have a conservatory which is great to escape to when you need to get out the rain, and a reasonable sized inside area too. Well done Greenwich Union, well done!Oh did I mention it was kid friendly? It's kid friendly.",

    "text": "We recently bowled in here for a Sunday roast whilst in the neighbourhood - as a visitor from the far North I'd often heard of The Union in the wilds of Greenwich, and was quite pleased with what I found. The main drawcard of this place is the beer: the tap selection is almost solely the preserve of Meantime Brewery, London's excellent artisans of the brew. There were around 6-8 interesting looking beers on keg, and 3 further ales on handpump. We tried several of them, and they were all very tasty & fresh tasting - the Smoked Bock was an interesting find, the Wheatbeer had the fruity character of the German variety it's based on, and the handpumped London Pale Ale was sheer hoppy, piney joy in a glass! The building itself seemed cosy enough, but with a slightly modernised edge to it: perhaps it was the blondwood finish of everything; it definitely didn't give off the vibe of Old Man pub. We ordered Sunday lunch, and whilst initially thought we might've been screwed over on portion size (I seem to recall the roast being \u00a312?), although it was all very tasty and by the time we'd finished we felt just on the pleasant side of being farctate. Which left room for more beer. The staff were friendly and helpful: the barman mistook my indecision over which beer to try for confusion, and set about describing the different styles, which he did very capably and clearly without sounding like a prat. I'd happily swing back through there - no questions! The only downside is that it didn't seem quite as cosy as the Richard I next door. Otherwise: nice battle cruiser, this!",

    "text": "Meantime might be the world's greatest brand of beer. So of course, any pub that specializes in serving Meantime is bound to rank pretty highly. I'm a big fan of the Greenwich Union. It's tucked away on a side street, close to all of the main attractions of Greenwich, but far enough away that you get few tourists than other places. Service was great. The bar staff was pretty efficient, even as the pub got packed later in the evening. My biggest problem with the Greenwich Union was the outdoor seating area. I sat on the back patio and got a great view of the tall, impenetrable wooden fence the pub had set up around its premises. My suggestion: If you find yourself in Greenwich, and you want a pint of Meantime, walk down the street to the Old Brewery. But without taking the Old Brewery into account, the Greenwich Union is tops.",

The staff are attentive and friendly, the food is good (especially the pork burger), they serve predominately Meantime Brewery's beers (which are my favourite), the prices are reasonable and both the inside and the beer garden are great places to hangout and spend the afternoon or evening in. Additionally, as the location is a bit off the beaten path, there really aren't the usual Greenwich tourist lingering about.For me, it really doesn't get much better than the Greenwich Union.

So far my description has not made it seem out of the ordinary at all, but it really does stand out from other pubs. The beer they serve is in fact from their own independent Meantime Brewing Company and not from any national breweries. On draught they have a variety of Bavarian country style lagers, pale ales and amber lagers whilst by the bottle you can try their delicious coffee and chocolate beers, as well as the other excellent worldwide beers they store.The lunch and dinner menus are simple and traditional- cod & chips, steak and stout pie, steak and chips and roast shoulder of lamb during the week, on Saturdays a reasonable brunch menu of eggs florentine and benedict, bacon butties and salt beef hashes and on Sundays, an excellent roast dinner for under 13 pounds (roast beef is 12.95 whilst lamb and chicken is 10.95) It is a perfect place for groups- the crowd is typically friendly and unpretencious- but also an excellent place to sit on your own and read the newspaper.",

We're happy to report that the Greenwich Union is still going strong and their beers and ales are fantastic! This is micro-brew without the 'tude. In the US we had gotten used to micro-breweries being obnoxious and over the top with arrogant self-absorption. This was definitely a breath of fresh air- a real true pub... that just so happens to also serve small-batch beer. We tried a couple of their seasonal brews, including the Belgian-style High Saison, and enjoyed all of them.The food is definitely not too shabby either. I had the sweet potato cake with goat cheese and rocket. Very flavorful! My husband ordered the burger and while he enjoyed it and thought it very good, he wanted it made clear that the beef was mixed with a lot of bread crumbs and spices. So if you're looking for a very beefy, American-style burger, this isn't it. But he really enjoyed it. Little one had the fish and chips (cod) and yum-yummed it right up.Service was snappy and very friendly and they were really happy to give us tasters of any of their beers. We sat in the front of the bar where it is slightly darker and more pubby, but the atrium area at the back looked warm and inviting and glowed a nice tangerine colour. It was full of locals enjoying a pint and some company on a lazy afternoon. The outdoor garden patio also looked fantastic, but it was on-and-off rainy and windy while we were there.We enjoyed ourselves very much and will definitely be back some time when we're in Greenwich again.",

My only two slight quibbles are that the pudding menu is slightly lacking (nothing with chocolate - apart from ice cream, and it's Winter!), and I was offered no option to have my burger rare/medium etc., and it came well done, which wouldn't have been my first choice. That said, it was still moist, well-seasoned and very enjoyable, so it's only a minor point for improvement.Trek up Royal Hill and find this place - cosy for a Winter's evening!",

Ok I will. Meantime and loads of other beers. With glasses to match. GLASSES TO MATCH. I'm coming here again. It's just a chilled atmosphere. I recommend you do too.",

The only annoying thing is that this place doesn't take reservations - and it can become busy and difficult to get a table at times. If eating, you can also put drinks on the tab (table service) and I was pleased to see that the bill didn't include an \"automatic gratuity\" insult that unfortunately has become standard around here",

A lot of locals, and lets face it, giving the location I don't see a whole lot of tourists crowding this place, which is a great thing.Talk about one of the best beer selection I ever seen. Several of them in the top 50 beers of the world. I'm yet to see that many top rated beers together anywhere in the US. Not to mention Meantime on draft. Meantime, a brewery I got introduced to by my friend while in London and oh how I wish I had some with me. Typical pub food but very very good. We were four and shared a Veggie burger, risotto, steak and Shepherd's pie. The veggie burger was incredible, can't believe I ate a veggie anything. The risotto was creamy and much better that what you find in some Italian restaurants. The steak was perfectly cooked and the Shepherd's pie was delicious. Another reason to love London.",

The establishment has a nice mixture of cozy and airy, which was perfect for a lazy(ish) Sunday. I hate to use this word, but I'll use it anyway (because I can't think of a better descriptor): the service here is \"super\" friendly, and very knowledgeable, particularly regarding the ales on tap. The barkeep gave us a few sample pours without waiting for us to ask, which we greatly appreciated. Because of that, we were more than happy with the pints we ordered. Moving on to the food: the roasts were delicious, in particular the pork loin, which was moist and flavorful. I enjoyed my roast beef as well. The Yorkshire pudding was wonderful and I might have been just as happy eating that alone for my meal, to be honest. The pub is in walking distance of the touristy areas of Greenwich, so it's easy enough to put some good food in your belly and continue on to your sightseeing, afterward.",

We were thinking of taking a tour of the brewery itself but we had heard a lot of hype about the Union and quite fancied a lunch out too which we couldn't really imagining brewery having much to offer in that department.As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable bartender who , before even asking, poured a small taster of a beer he had a preference for. After a short conversation with the staff I went on to order a paddle offering four 1/3 pints for \u00a36.50 which consisted of four meantime beers of my choice (Yakima red, Pilsner lager, raspberry wheat beer and London stout). Moving on to food ... We always judge a venue on the quality of their garlic bread and cheese so we both ordered garlic bread and hummus asking them to top off the bread with cheese. As far as the garlic bread and cheese goes it's a solid 9/10 just could have used more cheese but bar that it was perfect. For the mains I ordered a rack of ribs which was accompanied by fries and house slaw as are most rib dishes, but these ribs were sublime they were so soft and actually had a large amount of meat on the bone compared to most other places. My buddy ordered an aged Angus burger which I can only comment on the presentation and comments from my friend which were both 10/10.As for the venue it was perfect small hip location with great lighting and the wall decorations were fascinating. They consisted of vintage fosters and a huge selection of rare branded glasses, kind of like a small beer museum. The smoking area out back was covered , heated , decorated great and surprisingly clean for a smoking area. One final comment goes to the huge selection of craft beers available and even the bottle shop where you can pick up some rarities to take back with you.",

    "text": "I might be making it over to Greenwich more often! We reserved a table for 6 for 1pm a few days in advance, which was a good idea since all the tables were full for Sunday lunch.I ordered ribs that came with coleslaw and chips. The chips were crispy and fresh. The coleslaw wasn't the best, but I've come to expect that in the uk. It was too wet. The ribs were covered in a great spice rub and slathered with BBQ sauce. All in all a pretty fantastic meal. I wasn't drinking but my friends ordered different Meantime Ales and enjoyed them. There were also a bunch of kids there, so friendly for all.",

    "text": "My only previous experience of Greenwich was the area around the Cutty Sark and the touristy bits, but the Greenwich Union is worth checking out. In spite of the previous sentence, the pub was deceptively close to Greenwich park by way of a few side roads. I came here for Sunday lunch with 5 others at the end of October. We booked a table which was a good idea as the place was full.The Greenwich Union is one of the Meantime places which is fine by me as I really like their brews. The food was good, I was a little disappointed that the beef roast dinner was unavailable because of an operations management mistake but the fish and chips was a more than adequate replacement. Julia D had ribs which I hoped she wouldn't finish as they were great, I would recommend that off the menu. All in all very good.",

    "text": "Finally got to sample some of my favorite brewer's wares in person! \u00a0Great beer, good food and good ambience (can't beat being at a pub in England). \u00a0Tried the Meantime Fools Gold seasonal ale and it was really good, the porter was even better (and is different from their bottled porter).Had the veggie burger and chips (thick French fries) and both were really good. Many of the veggie burgers here are Halloumi made from cheese and a vegetable, in this case carrots. \u00a0Our server was kind enough to offer ketchup for the chips once she saw that I wasn't using the vinegar and salt on the table!We sat in the back outside area which is quieter than inside the pub and has heat lamps (which were needed).Well worth a visit if you are in Greenwich and are a fan of craft beers.",

    "text": "A friend and I who are fans of \u00a0Meantime Brewery thought we'd check the place out and for lunch and quick pint and we wasn't disappointed. The staff were friendly and had good knowledge of the beers they served. I went for a Cali PA which was really crisp and not too heavy while my friend went for a paddle. Onto the food: We started off with garlic bread(asked for extra cheese) and hummus. The hummus was really cold but tasted reasonable with a strong flavour of coriander. The garlic bread itself was moreish as it should be.Garlic bread with cheese o'meter - 7/10I had a burger which tasted like the best of pub burgers, with nice and crispy homemade chips and a nice garlic aioli. My friend had the ribs which came straight off the bone.The place has a nice vibe from the beer-oriented decor and friendly staff, and it's just the right size too. Definitely worth popping into if your around the area.",

    "text": "First time in Greenwich and had to make a choice for a quick weekend lunch. Given there are a lot of pubs right near the tube station and observatory, we almost ended up in one of the familiar chains. Fortunately, a quick Google search revealed the Greenwich Union as an independent pub serving local beer. That sounded good, so we went for it. It's a little bit of a hike away from the central (touristy) core and, oddly enough, right next to another big chain pub. Walk past that, in you're a fairly unremarkable interior but there's a nice solarium in the back and garden behind that.Once seated, service was quick and friendly. The menu looked pretty standard - fish and chips, burgers, pies, etc. - but the beer list was astounding! It's a huge list that's heavily tilted toward mid-range and higher end Belgian ales, plus a strong selection of craft American ale. There's also the local beer from Meantime, which we didn't end up trying. Settling on a Founders IPA, a sour ale from Lervig (Norway), a burger, and some fish and chips, we settled in for our meal.Food was served quickly and staff were again attentive. The beer was excellent, unsurprisingly. But the food really stood out. My wife said it was the best fish and chips she'd had in London (and we've tried a lot of fish and chips). The burger was moist, tender, and had a strong but not at all overpowering pepper flavor. One of the best burgers I've ever had to be honest. The chips looked a little questionable at first - maybe they were going to be too greasy, we said - but turned out to be quite the opposite.Highly, highly recommend. And we will be back, even though we don't live anywhere near Greenwich.",

The menu is not what you'd expect from a typical London pub. The staff is friendly and service is great. I've been a few times and would highly recommend stopping in for a pint or two plus a good meal. I would have rated it a 5 star - but the ribs deserve a better BBQ sauce.",
