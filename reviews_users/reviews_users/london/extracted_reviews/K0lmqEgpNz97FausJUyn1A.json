    "text": "Tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers - William Shakespeare - Romeo and Juliet - act 4, scene 2Wise words from The Bard, which should be a warning to all cooks to taste, taste, taste as they prepare their worldly delights. A tip which I would commend to the chef at The Swan at The Globe.The Globe Theatre is the defacto home of Shakespeare, a reconstruction of his original London theatre, located on the Southbank. The Swan is fully integrated into the theatre building but does have a separate entrance. The d\u00e9cor was very well put together, dark woods and intricate patterns were combined with plain tables and painted wooden chairs in the bar area. Upstairs, the Brasserie, where we were eating, was a simple design of creams and dark browns, with some interesting flower arrangements scattered about. A large dining table at one end provided the possibility of private dining once the heavy curtains were drawn. The layout was comfortable, and we certainly weren't falling across other diners - not least because there weren't many others; rather surprising for such a prime location. The Swan, as our hostess explained, has a busy sitting before the evening performance at the theatre after which the Brasserie closes in order to re-lay tables. J and myself were invited to take a drink at the bar.The menu is small, providing about 7 dishes per course, and all seem reasonably priced. Large menu selections fill me with dread and suspicion: large menus seldom provide fresh, quality produce.So to the food:J opened with potted shrimp, served in an old fashioned clasp fasten jam jar delicately placed on a folded white napkin. Unsure what to do with the napkin, it was swiftly removed. Slight hints of chilli - but ever so slight. My Scallops, with braised lentils and gremolata (the waitress was unsure how to explain what this was - so we only got as far as it's the sauce that comes with the lentils - it was clear she didn't know!), were well cooked: tender, juicy and sweet. The lentils were still very much al dente, bit too much for my liking. The common thread for both dishes however was blandness. And here I refer to my opening quotation. Dishes were well constructed and presented and arrived full of promise. But the lack of basic seasoning deflated two otherwise good plates of food. Taste, taste, taste.J's main course was Elwy Lamb with spring beans and thyme sauce and a side of classic cauliflower cheese. The cauliflower cheese tantalised with a crunchy cheesy top and cauliflower with a bit of a bite. The faintest bit of nutmeg provided a fleeting aftertaste; the sauce a bit thin. The lamb was nicely pink, just as promised.I had a beautifully baked salmon, still moist, with a topping of crisp skin. The accompanying crushed new potatoes and tomato sauce didn't thrill and let down the fish, but I did eat the lot.Once again the basics of seasoning was missing, the importance of which I can not understate. And if you're going to use tantalizing seasoning like nutmeg, then let's make sure it really incorporates into the dish, rather than being an afterthought.Pudding however was another matter and here the chef really excelled. J had a rhubarb pavlova - poached in a ginger syrup and laid on a chewy meringue filled with vanilla infused cream. I had one of the best sticky toffee puddings I've tasted for a long time - moist, sweet, not drowned in sauce. My only criticism is that it wasn't a big enough portion! Food 3/5 - Season and taste!Service 3/5 - Attentive, but staff lacking in menu knowledgeEnvironment 4/5 - Comfortable, d\u00e9cor Elle Decoration would be proud of says J.",

The acting is always first-class, and one has a feeling that there's a commitment from everyone: players, staff and audience. Quite rightly the Globe has become an item on tourism, but it definitely doesn't feel touristy. Anyone will see one of the very finest things the UK can offer.",

I see thee yet, in form as palapable, as this one on the brochure.. OK, I'm not Shakespeare, but maybe nor was he, according to some rumours. And this is not the Globe. It's a re-creation, not on the original site, envisioned by film-maker Sam Wanamaker. It looks way too new for my liking, and though it pulls in thousands of punters a day, it has an uneasy Disney feel for me. If you want to see where the Globe really was, head south, turn left under the railway bridge and look for a plaque on the wall. It's now a car park for a block of flats. Says it all really.",

Although it isn't in exactly the same spot as the original theatre, it has been lovingly and carefully recreated- as shown in the small museum included in the ticket price. Watching performances, you really get a true sense of how it would have been at the time, and why Shakespeare had to put certain stage directions and obvious statements in his plays. I don't think I could cope standing for the whole 3 hour play, but tickets are a lot cheaper and you get the true authentic experience if you do! If you go, take a cushion- you can hire them for a couple of pounds, but the seats are basic wooden benches and not that comfortable when you're sitting for that length of time.",

The tour around the theatre is great and takes you all around including back stage. There is also an interesting exhibit which shows the history of the theatre. The shows themselves are great to watch and as with the original Globe theatre you can buy cheap tickets in the pits, this is a area right in front of the stage, however there are no seats and you will need to stand for the duration of the show, so it is not for people with weak knees! Tickets for the pits are only \u00a35. On the plus side you are very close to the actors. However, if it does rain there is no rood over the pit to protect you!",

Unfortunately, when she brought it she didn't notice that I had no cutlery with which to eat it and disappeared so quickly that I couldn't ask. \u00a0I wound up eating my meal with my daughter's salad fork and my butter knife. \u00a0The dessert was \u00a0some kind of sorbet of a frankly alarming shade floating in a sugary soup with actual multi colored sprinkles on it. \u00a0Not to put too fine a point on it, but I'm an American and even I wouldn't touch it. \u00a0At this point I got up and retrieved our wine bottle so we could refill our (again!) empty glasses. \u00a0None of the servers who observed this offered assistance. \u00a0At the close of the meal someone who I assume was a manger asked how the meal was. \u00a0I shared my opinion of the service (as diplomatically as possible but after all, he asked) and \u00a0was not given an apology but instead was told it was our server's first day. \u00a0I don't mean to be insensitive but isn't it the responsibility of the establishment to put properly trained servers on the roster, especially in a restaurant that advertises (and prices) itself as an upscale dining experience? \u00a0I rarely give negative reviews but in this case, save your money and visit the downscale Anchor pub a few steps away. \u00a0Still a bit of history and you'll get a decent meal for a decent price.",

We got the fixed price three-course dinner. I had the lamb entree with a broccoli salad and gooseberry tart. My wife had hake, prawn bisque and peach Melba. Delightful!",

This wasted a further 5 minutes.(3) I proceeded to order a margarita. Despite assurances in the menu, I was not asked how I'd like it served - on the rocks, straight, salt rim or not. They also missed out on a chance to upsell me to a better brand of tequila.(4) They failed to double-strain the drink, which is standard procedure with any shaken drink of this nature.(5) The drink was completely devoid of any garnish - no lime wheel, twist or anything.(6) Margarita was overly dilute and somewhat unbalanced.It's terribly disappointing - I pass by on a regular basis, and there's a dearth of cocktail bars nearby, so it would have been ideal if this was a good drinking hole. Perhaps it is, if you stick to beer, but their cocktails are nowhere near as good as they should be.",

    "text": "In its first staging at The Globe Theatre, All's Well That Ends Well is brought to life in John Doves production. It tells the story of Helena (Ellie Piercy) who is in love with her Count Bertram (Sam Crane) though he doesn't seem to notice she exists. After curing the King of France (played wonderfully by Sam Cox) she is allowed to marry the man of her choosing and chooses Bertram, much to the delight of his mother, the Countess of Roussillion (played delightfully by Janie Dee). As this is a Shakespeare story, nothing goes to plan and Helena is left feeling rejected and in need of a plan to truly win the heart of the man she loves. Although it is one of Shakespeare's lesser than plays, All's Well That Ends Well is the perfect production for a place like The Globe, with its simple storyline and modest scenery and cast. You really feel as if you are personally witnessing this love story unfold as if you were a member of the household and can't help but feel your heart warmed by an ending, that for once, ends the way you feel every love story should. All's Well That Ends Well is showing at The Globe Theatre until August 21st. itsnosmallthing.weebly.c\u2026",

    "text": "On a stretch of river in our capital city filled with world famous buildings and iconic views, there can only be two sureties; loud, jostling hungry tourists, and overpriced, substandard restaurants to feed them.One of the jewels along the waterside is the Globe Theatre. Only a teenager (started by Sam Wannamaker in 1970, opening after his death in 1997), it fits in perfectly with its older neighbours and has rightly become a real destination along the bank. For the last year or so they've also been blessed with the Swan. A lovely little bar and brasserie \u00a0adjoining the theatre 'directed' by ex Ramsay cohort Mark Sargeant, there's a sense of real purpose about the menu. They shout loud and proud about their reliance on foragers, farmers and local markets (they are just up the road from Borough Market after all) and the menu reflects this seasonality. Sadly that season has just passed. On a gorgeous spring night it's a shame that most of the food on offer has a distinctly wintery note. Don't get me wrong, I love the sound of the Cashel Blue macaroni cheese and spiced Elizabethan mutton casserole is just what you'd expect to eat before outdoor Shakespeare, but not when the weather outside is so warm.I went for the one seasonal starter. Trimmed asparagus with hollandaise. Sometimes kitchens have to realise that you don't mess with perfection and that was certainly the case. Cooked for a couple of minutes, lightly drizzled with a zingy sauce, it was heaven. Nicco Polo was slightly less lucky. His scallop and spring onion gratin was average at best, with an excess of herbed breadcrumbs and a strong gratin sauce overwhelming the more delicate scallops.The confit pork belly was a big homely portion. Again, not necessarily suited to a spring night, but I'm a big fan of the pig and won't let a little thing like seasonality get in my way. The large slab came with a sweet honey and dill glazed crackling, sweetly tender fat and a creamy, mustardy celeriac remoulade that set it off perfectly.Finishing off with the summer pudding, I was struck by just how conducive the restaurant was to having a good time. It was so friendly and comfortable with some excellent food, that and the very central location mean I'll certainly be coming back. For a very reasonable price, we had three strong courses, an aperitif and a Chilean Pinot Noir from a tasty little list that struggled to top \u00a340 a bottle. Looking out at the tourists crossing the Millennium Bridge as the light gradually faded behind St Paul's dome we wondered how many of them would look up and check out the Swan, or given the sad state of occupancy would they all end up flooding into the overpriced 'ye olde pubbe' or one of the chain restaurants that infest the area. More fool them if they do.",

Service was also extremely surly and slow.We arrived at the restaurant a bit early so I slipped away to speak to someone about ordering dessert and having a birthday message piped onto the plate. The \"manager\" just gave me a blank look and told me to talk to one of the servers who will \"deal with it\". Not a good start. Food didn't arrive for a good 30-45 minutes. I ordered a rare steak which came medium - so I sent it back. It took another 15 minutes for them to bring me my food. By then nearly everyone at the table had finished eating because they were so hungry! The sides were TINY, onion rings were burnt, and fries were oversalted. My friend ordered the pork belly, which was dry and came with crackling that wasn't even crispy!Dessert wasn't great either. A good sticky toffee pudding should be gooey...this one was dry and very cakey. Even though it could've been an off-day, but I definitely won't be giving Swan at the Globe another go. One of the worst meals of the year for me.",

The Swan is located in the Globe entrance, the main restaurant is upstairs on the 3rd floor and is worth all the pennies. Take a break from the grime and bustle of London tourists and join the upper class at the top of the Swan. Service and food were fantastic. \u00a0I had a full three course meal with wine and 2 750ml bottles of Blenheim Palace water for \u00a350 (including larger tip) \u00a0If I had not been so dehydrated or a big tipper the meal would have been \u00a340. \u00a0 But it was so worth the view, food, view, experience and service that it made the day complete. I had the salmon to start with, mushroom crepe for main course and the bitter chocolate moose which was superb! They bring bread to the table in little sacks which was really good, made up for the bread they served with the salmon which I did not like. Looking around the main course salmon was huge, but had a lot of bones in, the burgers and steaks looked great too. \u00a0I had a great server with a fantastic sense of humor. \u00a0I would make a point to go again if I was in the area.",

We visited on a sunny day, and enjoyed a clear view of St Paul's Cathedral, and riverside buildings - one of the best backdrops I can imagine! The interior is light and airy, the service is efficient - we had a charming waiter. I chose the special, grilled salmon, which was beautifully done, and my friend had the spring onion tart. We saved room for dessert! What a selection of classics: cherry pie with Devon cream, Bramley apple pie and (I chose) lemon cake with pistachio ice cream. The wine list is a decent selection too.",

Impressively, it even doesn't give that much of a touristy feeling as I would have expected..But the service.. Let me tell you, they should reconsider training or maybe providing training for the staff.. Nobody knew what to do.. They weren't sure where to seat us and whether we could sit at certain table. This horror continued with clearly unexperienced girl with visibly bored face and bored performance.. When I asked for fresh mint tea, they responded they don't have any. When I pointed out the bunches of fresh mint on the bar, clearly ready for being used, the waiters responded they cannot be used for the tea as they are for the cocktails.. (I mean, WHAT??!!!) So she goes and asks the barman, who really didn't let her to get few of those mint leaves..Payment seemed also a difficult task to do.. The waiters sighed loudly when we wanted to split the bill.. Seeing her bored face, we just took out our phones and calculated for her.. Food wise, well... Back to the service.. The waiters didn't know the menu... Taste wise, it was alright.. Nothing I would want to come back for as you can get that kind of food anywhere with waaaaay better experience.. Portions on the smallish side..In overall, it was a tragedy... I will not be back and recommend avoiding at all costs!Actually, I am exaggerating.. I've seen worse...",

It is a restored (if slightly relocated) version of the original Shakespeare's theatre that was built in the South Bank in Shakespeare's time! The actors are amazing, and even though the seats are highly uncomfortable (wooden benches) you have great visibility from anywhere at all. All plays have \u00a35 standing tickets for spots in the ground area below the scene. Definitely worth it if you're into theatre but can't find regular tickets (plays are regularly sold out months in advance!) or just can't afford them.",

I would actually say it's worth heading over just to look at the building, which is a reconstruction of the original Globe theatre, and to mosy round the gift shop, which has some original souvenirs, many of which are at reasonable prices and of good quality. It also has quite a large book and play section.If you have a bit more time, I would definitely recommend seeing a play. Tickets are very good value if you don't mind standing - I only paid a fiver, which is amazing really - less than a cinema ticket! It is a long time to stand, but I think you get the best experience if you do - it's authentic, and the actors really make the most of having groundlings, dancing and playing music amongst the crowd before the play. In terms of the production, I was very impressed. It was well directed and engaging, and the actors were really good - I was very impressed with them working on through a huge downpour of rain (and a word of warning - as a groundling, you will get soaked if it rains!).Overall, I would certainly recommend a trip to this attraction, whether you are a tourist or a Londoner. This is Shakespeare as it was meant to be seen!",

Definitely ask for a window table when you book. Looking out over the river with pretty boats floating past, St Pauls thrusting magnificently upwards, offices lit like jewels on the far shore, it's the kind of place where eating alone would be thoroughly pleasurable. Shame the food doesn't quite live up to this magnificence. I seriously doubt Mark Sargent has ever set foot in the kitchen, the food is simply not to that kind of standard. It is good, but not really good, and definitely not great which is a shame. I started with the best dish of the night - a perfectly rare pigeon breast atop a pile of creamy lentils. The man had smoked salmon that had a pretty scattering of boiled egg yolk that added nothing by way of flavour or texture as it was simply to fine to make an impression. The other man had potted shrimp that were a little too fridge cold and not notably spiced with anything. Mains were less good, my cod had been cooked a bit too long and the dryness was not well covered by the mussel and clam soup. At alomst \u00a320 it was a disappointment. The man liked his lamb and it's kidney. The other man ordered the special - steak and kidney pudding - which was tiny. It would easily have fitted into a teacup and came with nothing but a jug of gravy. Lucky we ordered some buttered kale as a side. didn't go for desserts but did have a cheese plate which well presented. Service was friendly but I have to say I'd return to have a drink in the bar downstairs - and order a bowl of chips to go with if I was peckish -rather than climb the stairs for dinner.",

Often there are actors interspersed through the crowd at the foot of the stage, and players often enter and exit through the crowds.

I saw a midnight anniversary production of Hamlet at the Globe, and despite the unusual hour the services available were still good. The prices are good, very cheap for yard seats if you're prepared to stand, and slightly more for seats. The seats are more typical of the period and aren't designed with comfort in mind - they're more like school benches; hard and quite painful after a 3 hour play. Nevertheless you get some shelter if the weather doesn't hold out in the open air. Despite the time, there was a variety of foods available in the interval including good quality, authentic looking sausages in ciabatta. You should definitely see at least one play at the Globe - ideally a Shakespearian play, both for the excitement of the performance, but also for the experience of this unique venue.",

It's definitely a lot of food for one person but I enjoyed trying everything, it's a great value. I was seated right by the window and enjoyed the view of the Thames and people watched lazily. The presentation of the meal was all star (coming in four tier and with beautifully designed desserts and sandwiches) and served on Anna Westler's custom designed tea seat for Shakespeare's Globe.",

The wine was good - not great - but it was served in a plastic bottle with plastic cups so we could take it in to the theatre to enjoy the rest whilst we watched the play.

The servers know when the show starts and can accommodate a fast turn around for guests. The place gets pretty loud when it's crowded.

    "text": "A walk around the Thames on a sunny afternoon can be a treat. The weather is so unpredictable that when you are blessed with a bit of sunshine and warmth, it can really lift your spirits and make you much more sociable. London Bridge is a meeting point for some of my friends and I, as it is central for us all to make our way home. It's not a bad spot at all with its bars, pubs, market, places of interest and flow of interesting folk. Whilst I have never been to the Shakespeare's Globe, I have always wandered about the idea of seeing a production outdoors, weather permitting. It must be quite the experience and yes, it is on my to-do list. For now, I was close enough having dinner at the Swan which is right next door.The Swan is a bar on the ground floor and restaurant on the first floor. They do not jest when they say they have stunning views, they do, as if you get the right spot you can see all the nearby landmarks such as St Pauls, on the north side of the Thames. Following a drink in nearby Borough Market, we visited for a meal as recommended by my dining partner. She had recently had a birthday dinner here and was well impressed. It was busy and although we did not have a reservation, we literally got the best table in the spot. For dinner it was going to be straight to the main course with me having salt marsh lamb rump, sea vegetables, Cornish potatoes and cockle butter. \u00a0I also had a size of peas and enjoyed all elements of my food. The lamb in particular was very tender. Eleanor had 400g Galloway rib eye steak, watercress, pickles shallot salad with chops and bearnaise. The food is modern British with a flair for making the simple luxurious. Because of excellent quality of the food and its proximity to the Globe, the crowd are mature and discerning diners. Swan restaurant is not a place for raucous and informal behaviour. It is much more subtle and formal than that. This is not a bad thing if you want the focus to be on enjoying the food as the lead player, which it deserves. The service also stands out too, with a nice pace in service. In terms of pricing, it is not cheap but at \u00a328.50 for a steak, you work out if you feel this is expensive. I see Swan restaurant as a romantic location to celebrate quality time with your loved one or good food for your theatre visit.",

The pancake batter is similar to that of a victoria sponge and are griddled in butter, resulting in the most perfectly fluffy crunchy cake heaven you'll ever put in your mouth. The pancakes are then topped in a berry compote and scratch-made whip cream. The whip cream has little flecks of vanilla bean and is perfectly sweetened. No maple syrup is needed for pancakes this good.My partner ordered the eggs florentine. I tried some of his hollandaise sauce and it was divine. What a lovely spot overlooking the Thames.

Served from 11:30 am - 3:30 pm Monday thru Saturday and 2:00 - 3:30 pm on Sunday, it was the perfect afternoon pick-me-up. The restaurant itself is two levels, with the tea taking place on the top, more formal level. We were seated near a window which provided a great view of the River Thames and surrounding landmarks. For 26.50 pounds, we got a three tiered display of sandwiches, biscuits and desserts. We also ordered two pots of tea and, since I was feeling celebratory, a glass of Love Potion, a mix of Earl Grey infused gin, honey from the London Honey Co, blackberry puree and prosecco, topped with fresh blackberries. It was SO GOOD. Let's just say my dream of tea was more than fulfilled. It was such a nice respite from touring London and I would definitely recommend. Although this spot may be on the pricier side, the ambiance, service and quality of food was more than worth it!",

Once lunchtime rolled around, she took our order, but then we saw others ordering off a different lunch menu than we were offered. One thing we ordered were the cracklings (after noon because we were told we could not order before noon). When it came out it was cold, (telling me they were pre-cooked) so the waitress' story that \"the chef hasn't arrived\" to cook all the food was a crock. Plus, having been in F&B, if you're a chef showing up right at noon to start prep and cooking for lunch, you're about 3-4 hours late. After we left, we walked by the kitchen windows and saw several \"chefs\" running around making lunch. It's terrible when you KNOW you're being lied to.",

    "text": "Though we initially chose the Swan for its proximity to Shakespeare's Globe Theater, this elegant restaurant, located on property, is by no means merely riding on the coattails of the famed stage's popularity. With its timeless, romantic atmosphere & food so impeccably prepared, I've no doubt that the Swan could succeed in the middle of nowhere. Aromatic rosemary & onion flavors their sliced bread (& ya gotta love a place that serves room temperature butter!) Many compliments for his ribeye, & my tart, topped with a beautiful assortment of roasted veggies, was absolutely delectable. The light, delicate layers of puff pastry became rich when coated in red wine butter sauce. And speaking of butter, my side of heritage potatoes were coated in the perfect marriage (or rather, m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois?!) of butter, oil, & herbs. We had dinner upstairs, but should you have time restraints, the abbreviated bar menu available on the ground level looked just as lovely. Spectacular views, wonderful service, & maximum flavor in each forkful; needless to say, the Swan is a charmer.",

First time, to grab dessert and a drink before the the play \"Comus: A Masque in Honour of Chastity\". As part of my solo dirty 30 celebration.Second time, after the play for a bit of warm soup and two cocktails (2 of the Rose Sangria and does taste like rose!). The third time, for an actual proper meal... I had the soup again, the main course special: pheasant,and apple pie with vanilla ice... My favorite was the peasant because it had a nice umami sauce with rosemary. The second favorite part of the meal was the dessert with its fresh out of the oven pastry and delicate apple goodness.Also the people you meet are worth it. Ranging from the locals to Aussies to drunk out of their minds folks, it won't be a dull evening. So, I recommend coming here during the evening if you want a savory English meal or a pint.",

At night you'd have a good view of the lights on the opposite riverbank The pre-theatre menu is overpriced for the mediocre food on offer. We both ordered the Herb Crusted Sea Trout with Potato & Cucumber Salad, Pickled Mustard Seeds with Squid Ink and Garlic Mayonnaise. As soon as we saw it we said \"It's salmon\" and the arrogant waiter's reply was \"Trust me, it's trout\". \u00a0It was definitely salmon as I only eat fish and it was slightly overcooked. The amount of salad was about a heaped tablespoon and the mayonnaise was in a tiny dish, so not a big meal. For dessert I had Baked BlackBerry Tart, Frangipane with cream. I've had better and the pastry crust was very hard. \u00a0We were annoyed by the frequency of waiter visits to top up water and wine. Surely we could have looked after our own water. There are plenty of other restaurants near the Bankside so I'd give it a miss unless you want a good view after dark. Beware: they add 12.5% service charge is added.",

But sometimes I want something more casual, no fancy dress code, somewhere I can relax and be cosy and Swan at the Globe is always one of those places I return to for that. It is a mix crowd of people depending on what time you come. I am recommending an early brunch as it's definitely more quiet and peaceful before the bar gets busy and the louder crowd comes in, especially during the weekends for pre-theatre drinks.They have recently refurbished their upstairs restaurant if you prefer more formal dining but I haven't been upstairs to comment. One thing I find myself drooling for are their beautiful rich yolky poached Legbar eggs. It must be the reason why their eggs Benedict is known to be their signature dish being voted top 10 in London by the Evening Standard too.We started with a mocha and an Americano presented in two different classic mugs like I entered someones's home. Very cute. Mocha was rich and chocolatey and Americano smooth and fragrant. Good coffee! For food we ordered:Eggs florentineJust like how I ordered them 3 years ago. The muffin was light and fluffy, toasted do was nice and crisp around the edges. The spinach was fresh, velvety and cooked to perfection. But the highlight of it all were those two large poached eggs sitting on top. The yolk came out blood orange, deliciously rich and thick. The accompanied hollandaise sauce did it much justice adding that lovely creaminess to it and bringing everything together.Full English breakfastIt didn't have all the fancy presentation or looked like much. But the beauty was inside as everything tasted great. Juicy portobello mushroom, silky creamy scrambled eggs, sweet crispy bacon, the sausages were very flavoursome, full of herbs and texture and same goes for the black pudding. It came with a jar of baked beans so it was kept warm inside but you ate it and a slice of toast. Service was great and efficient. We even asked for more of that delicious crisp fluffy toast to accompany it all and they gave it to us without no questions.Buttermilk pancakes, berry compote and vanilla cream. These were slightly disappointing. The pancakes themselves were slightly too dense and bland. The berries were tart but refreshing if you like that kind of sourness. The vanilla cream did a good job balancing out the flavours though. Overall I really enjoy Swan at the Globe. Although it is right next to the Globe theatre itself, a big tourist attraction, prices are still affordable. If you manage to grab a booth table and able to enjoy the comfy leather couch seating then you can find yourself here letting time fly by. Otherwise it might be a shared table with other diners next to you. Whatever it is just order an eggs Florentine/Royale/Benedict. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Had such an amazing dining experience here! Got to have some afternoon tea with friends. While visiting London, we all knew we needed to have afternoon tea. The places we looked at were all booked in advance, unfortunately. And after attempting a different location and getting rejected since they were fully booked, we happened across Swan. They too were fully booked as well, but the hostess immediately attempted to find us a table despite this fact. And after a few minutes, she came back with a spot for us! So A+ customer service already!! The bottom plate was definitely my favorite of course. The savory foods, ughhh those small finger sandwiches are to die for. On the second plate were the scones, which were absolutely delicious! They melted in your mouth. On the final third plate on top were the sweet sweet desserts. All of them tasted amazing! The restaurant was I believe three floors, and the ambiance of the whole place is a big WOW! Modern, gorgeous and cute all at the same time. Also, the location of the place is walking distance to many tourist areas.. Service is amazing, the tea was great and they offered different choices. I also got a cocktail or 'love potion' as they called it, which was super good (& strong hahah!).",

Apparently there are many variations but this is the classical style.This is now my second favorite way to eat eggs, eggs Benedict would be my first. But Scotch eggs don't necessarily need to be eaten for breakfast, they make a good anytime snack and go well with a pint of beer. Ended up getting several plates of these tasty treats. The Swan is a lovely place with a great view of the Thames and located next to the Globe theater. They have wooden bench seating in the middle, booth on the sides and outside seating is available in the nautical themed space. They also serve up a good fish and chips. We were here for lunch but also visited late while taking a stroll down the river walk. We stopped in and had a few drinks, place is very lively. It is a very open space and nicely decorated, the staff were super friendly and there seems to be a good mix of people who visit the place.",

She quickly showed us to a sofa and two chairs were we had a lovely inside view. The atmosphere is fun and the prices are better than most pubs.

    "text": "09/13/17Not far from Tate Modern Museum. This is the restaurant that is connected to Shakespeare's Globe with gorgeous views of the Thames river and St. Paul's cathedral. This two story restaurant a partner with the Shakespeare Globe Theater for over a decade. Contemporary British cuisine is showcased here. Morgan I think was the Maitre D but he ended up being our waiter. He was unbelievably knowledgeable, friendly and an expert in customer service. I can not impart how truly wonderful, attentive and friendly he was. We continued to rave not only about him but about the food. There are bites in our life that leave an indelible memory on our brain. Memories of lovely and luscious, delectable, savory and sweet treats play in my mind. This was my families first time to London and our fist time to this restaurant. We were leaving London and my daughter and I wanted to try a high tea before we left. I made the faux pas of not dressing up. I humbly apologized to the hostess and to Morgan who was beyond kind and gracious and told us not to worry! Thanks Morgan for making us feel welcome and understood. Was super excited to try the new menu for high tea that was made to compliment a Midsummer Night's Dream. The dinner ware had Midsummer Night's Dream character's on them. I was super amused and wish that my photo's of the plates and flatware turned out. Even the menu had the same design as our plates. My daughter and I have never had high tea. We felt it was a must do before we left London. High tea is a shared platter. We ordered tea. I ordered Sapphire Earl Grey my daughter had the Egyptian mint. My husband and son ordered off the main menu. My husband ordered the special of the day. My son got slow cooked short rib or beef with braised carrots, mashed potatoes and pickled onions.Our meals arrived together. My daughter's and mine was a three tier platter. The first platter was dessert, the second scones and the first savory items. On our menu was wild mushroom and leek quiche, Wiltshire ham with grain mustard and pea shoots, oak smoked salmon with lemon pepper butter on dark rye, Clarence court egg with mayonnaise and watercress. These little bites were so delectable and tasty that I had to close my eyes and savor each and every bite. My daughter and I were beyond pleased. I love salmon but that one was my least favorite. The second tier had mulberry and plain scones with clotted cream and strawberry jam. This was the first time we had a British scone. These scones were flaky, lightly crisp around the edges with a light and airy center. The clotted cream and jam on top just put them over the top. Thanks again to Morgan who when asked what the etiquette was on how to enjoy the High Tea. He was so kind and full of information. He was right the jam and clotted cream really make the scones heaven. The desserts at the top were divine. They were rose infused raspberry and lemon cake, Elderflower and violet macroons, glazed white chocolate blondie with caco nibs, blackberry compote with lavendar cream. I know it doesn't sound like a lot of food but it was. I was not able to finish both of my scones because it was so much food.The desserts were so light, airy and luscious. Again we were closing our eyes to savor the flavor and moment. The cost seemed to be about average when I was researching High Teas in London. I can only rave about our high tea or about Morgan. Would I go back? You bet I would. While we were munching down our little finger foods off the High Tea platter we could hear my husband and son oohing and ahhing over their own plates. Can I just say look at my pictures and I am sure you can understand why they were in love with their meal. I truly hope that Morgan is give Kudos!! Thanks so much Swan Shakespeare Globe for a wonderful, superb meals that will leave a memory that will last a lifetime or the next time we go to London!!",

I had the lamb roast dinner as a main and it was delicious. Great roast potatoes and I was very pleased to see a Yorkshire pudding included in the \"trimmings\". My lamb was flavoursome, if a little fatty. \u00a0I opted for a meringue and fruit desert. It was good but my friend had the brown sugar tart which was delicious and immediately gave me dessert envy. Lovely service and the staff were very attentive. They checked on us and get us topped up with wine throughout the meal. Finally, the thing that absolutely makes this place a must visit, is the view from the dinner table. Beautiful scenes of the river and the stunning skyline across London.",

However, it's a wonderul experience and offers plenty of extra tours and the like for those who cannot stay for an actual play, although I would always recommend the play if you can.

As it was London Restaurant Festival, we decided to treat ourselves for lunch for a friend's birthday, and this was the first place that was open and had space. And, boy, were we glad about that. The setting looking out over the Thames is absolutely beautiful and the food matched this. Starters of scallop gratin, potted shrimp, smoked salmon and leek and potato soup (with a poached egg), were all playful and delicious, while the mains - roast beef and pork belly, were all devoured and were spot on. The carrot and swede mash was a particular highlight. Desserts were also delicious, but we probably didn't quite do them justice, given how stuffed we were. Two of our group were in raptures about the Sherry Trifle, the crumble and the chocolate mousse were both delicious, although the sticky toffee pudding was a little dry. The only real complaint was the service was a tad slow at times. But the food was delicious and given it was a very lazy Sunday lunch, this wasn't as big an issue as it might have been. I'd love to try the regular non-Sunday menu.",

Having said that, the food ain't half bad either, as you'd expect when the head chef is a Ramsey protege like Mark Sargeant. The menu consists of solid British fare plus some quirky items such as Elizabethan mutton casserole,and kipper pate. The highlight for me was a seafood cocktail with a nice feisty gazpacho. Lots of flavour, good ingredients and a novel concept - nice little dish. They also often have very good Top Table deals so it's worth watching out for those. We ate there at 8.30 on a Friday night and were still able to get 40% off the food. Very tidy!",

It was lovely and one of my favorite tea experiences in London so far. The atmosphere was perfect for a rainy day, warm and comforting with lots of seating and soothing lighting. Our server, Emma, was extremely nice and warmly welcomed us and looked after us throughout our experience. I got a pot of English breakfast tea and a huge piece of carrot cake and my friend got the mint tea and a scone-all for \u00a312. I am confused as to why this place was labeled with \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3, I thought it was quite affordable, even the main menu items weren't over the top. The Swan is has a very versatile clientele, men in business suits grabbing a pint after work, ladies who lunch, theater goers having an early dinner, everyone seems to go here and there's something for everyone. Check out their drink menu when you go; it is full of very creative and Shakespeare themed drinks.",

The benches in the theatre are quite uncomfortable, especially if you've been sitting on them for a couple of hours. I would recommend getting one of the wooden seats with cushions if you intend on sitting down. You can buy standing tickets very cheaply but you're not allowed to sit on the floor if you get tired so be careful! There are stalls outside selling drinks and snacks. The atmosphere is buzzing - a fab day out!",

    "text": "Most people have already covered the main points about the Globe. So I'll just add my tuppence worth. It truly is a wonderful addition to a great city. Kitted out like the original open air theatre, this is the only place to go in summer for a spot of Shakespeare. There are \u00a35 standing tickets for every show, which is awesome value. Some of the the shows are 3 hours long! The down side is that you have to stand for that long, but to be honest, it's the only way to see a show there. For those who chicken out and get cushioned seats, they miss out on the best of it with the groundlings. One of the best shows i ever did see was at the Globe. It was a production of Pericles (which I hadn't seen before), directed by Kathryn Hunter. On the night that I went to see it, Corin Redgrave, who was the principal actor playing old Pericles, had been rushed to hospital, and the then artistic director Mark Rylance stepped into the role. It was wonderful. Really, brilliantly, marvellously, awesomely wonderful. Since Dom Dromgoole has taken over the artistic directorship, the programme has become significantly more edgy and violent. Not necessarily a bad thing. The Globe also puts on new writing that has a basis in Jacobean styles. As with everything creative, sometimes it's good and sometimes it ain't. I walked out at the interval at the press night of a new show last year. As much because it was boring as it was because it was raining. It is great when you find a show that's worth standing in the rain for though.",

It only costs \u00a35 to stand and watch but be warned it can be tiresome after 3 hours standing on a concrete flour. I suggest getting in as early as possible and getting a place either near the front where you have more space to sit down at the interval, or right at the back where you can at least lean on the partition to the seating. The plays are well acted and good use of the venue is used. Refreshments are available but are pricey. A shop is inside and there are some good quality souvenirs available at reasonable prices.",

I got to visit right after it was built in the late 90s and unfortunately, there were no plays being shown during my short stint in London. This bummed me out hugely, but I hope to go see a play here next time I visit. As an attraction and a tour, the Globe is a must-see in London. The theatre is a real site to behold. It was built based on the exact dimensions of the original which burned down a long time ago. It wasn't built in the same location, but from what I remember, it wasn't built that far away from where the original stood. The workmanship of the building, the artistry of the woodwork was very much felt, as was the sense of history it represented, even though it was a reproduction. I really look forward to seeing a play here next time I'm in London.",

I have seen plays both as a 'groundling' and from a seat. I did not enjoy standing about on the groundpartly because it was really really long, but mostly because I am a bit short, and the stage is really high, so I felt like I was missing loads of stuff as I couldnt really see..also I got spat on by an actor!! From the seats it was better, but if you are too high up, you can loose some of the words, as the lack of roof makes the sound a bit funny. That said it is definately worth the experience, and there is no where else where theatre is quite the same!",

The Bard was looking pretty good for his age - Firstly we took a look through the museum. It's a bit dated and naff for a museum. Personally I love all the info detailing the rebuilding of the Globe, the info on London at the time etc, but I think the main space there could be a little bit better in its lighting and ease of access. It's a little bit like being led around a rat run. After we'd seen the museum we went upstairs to view the theatre itself. Much better!We sat in the sun and watched some of the free performances of music and recitals by members of the unsuspecting public. For corporates there is a amll auditorium and various small meeting and dining rooms that can be hired. My favourite is the Swan at the Globe restuarant and the room abouve it that both look over the Thames with views up and down the river. Don't know if I would really pay to see the museum, but definitely worth a performance - especially at the \u00a35.00 standing deals they do all summer.",
