The take-away side is mostly stand-up eating only with a couple tables, less expensive, and mostly for fish and chips. The \"sit-down\" side looks nice inside. Our party of 4 was seated right away at 7:45 p.m. However, it took 55 minutes from the time we ordered to receive all of our food. The waitress explained that the take away side was very busy, so the kitchen was backed up. The food was delicious, but unfortunately, the service was so poor- we couldn't get anyone's attention to get our water refilled, ketchup brought to the table, or help with anything else. Because of the previous good reviews, we wanted to like this place, but it just left us feeling disappointed.",

    "text": "Some of our cousins from across the pond or over the Channel may take a certain view on the idiosyncrasies of 'British' cooking. There are the names, for a start. Spotted Dick. Toad in the Hole. Severed Retina in Suet. I may have made one of those up. Fish 'n' Chips (you have to use the 'n'... it's traditional) is a timeless example of the genre, and has the added advantage of being What It Says On The Tin. And we should make the distinction here. Chips are not fries. Fries are thin, and made of cardboard. Chips are thick and made of grease. I have spent at least some of my life living in Yorkshire, and they take their fish 'n' chips seriously up there. The Seashell, though, is the equal of any Northern pretender. The pisces in question are spanking fresh and sheathed in light crispy batter. The chips, contrary to the laws passed down from parent to issue throughout the annals of British culinary history, are crisp. And they sell big bloody gherkins to go with them. Gherkins, as I may have mentioned in a previous review, are good. Oh yes, and they sell proper scampi, which remind me of being 8. Christ knows why. I must have eaten a lot of scampi as a young fella. All the usual suspects are present. I'm talking about the fish, not the clientele. There is, oddly, a restaurant attached to the chippy. Or perhaps it's a chippy attached to a restaurant. The room is clean and faintly 50s-looking, and the service is nice and friendly and tends to be a tad slow. I spend occasional Fridays having lunch there - it's my Catholic upbringing - and in this instance I don't really mind if the food takes a while. If I was rushing on a Monday, I might feel differently. Here's the kicker it isn't cheap. Lunch will set you back \u00a311 for fish and - sorry, 'n' - chips, or the takeaway is \u00a36 or thereabouts, depending on what you have. Annoyingly, at the takeaway you pay extra for sauces like ketchup and tartare, which would seem to me to be necessities rather than luxuries. Still, it's a small sacrifice for what is a fine, nay, pre-eminent example of the genre. Don't forget your gherkin.",

The Seashell has slid down and down over the years (the fire that destroyed the whole place was the best thing that happened recently). Like a glutton for punishment, I returned here recently to see if things had gotten any better since the rebuild from the fire. Unfortunately, I am unable to say that things are particularly good here. Now, let me tell you why... The chips here are far below the standard you would expect from a gourmet style fish and chip shop. They do not have that good chippy potato taste and are made from the cheapest possible stock. I ordered haddock for myself and my accompanying mum went for the cod. Although it looked pretty impressive, when it turned up (i.e. it was huge), it was very disappointing that they had not cooked my haddock properly. I cannot describe how horrible it is to bite into partially cooked fish in batter. The clear liquid that spewed forth with my bite was nauseating. They were good enough to accept a return on this, however I did not trust haddock a second time and went for the safe option of cod. The staff who work there are polite enough, but they really do not have any training or any knowledge of what good fish and chips is. Not exactly a solid foundation to put a business together and especially when they charge the high prices that they do for the reputation that has gone before. A disappointing exercise. But hey I'm English right? So I must crave disappointment deep down in everything I do!",

    "text": "Being a complete tourist in London - I suppose the ratings might be correct. \u00a0Maybe there is some amazing fish and chips restaurant in London that I didn't hear about - - but this was the place we knew about, and this was the place the concierge recommended. \u00a0Every single cab driver seemed to know it, too.So - upon arriving in the city of London, the very first thing we did, prior to even getting to the room, was hit up \"the best fish and chips in London\" - Sea Shell of Lisson Grove.Now, perhaps I've been subjected to mediocre fish and chips for all of my American life...Perhaps I tasted mediocre in London and didn't know the difference between this and \"amazing\"....In any case, I was blown away!The fresh fish was expected, but the batter was SO light that at no time did I feel like I was eating something not quite healthy. \u00a0Excepting the \"chips\" (french fries, in other words) this fried fish felt as healthy as a salad w/ some ham on it.When asked what I wanted for a drink, I realized I have an irresistible urge for beer at the mere thought of fried foods, but didn't like some of their beers, and didn't recognize others until... GUINNESS.OK, that'll do.It turns out Guinness in the UK is better than Guinness in the US, but nowhere near that of Guinness in Ireland. \u00a0Not surprising, but due to proximity, I hoped.We also shared an order of calamari, and a fish soup that was on the menu. \u00a0This fish soup was outstanding, and the calamari was surprisingly good, though nothing like the calamari one would expect. \u00a0Whole pieces of squid, battered in something very light, lightly fried and only somewhat crisp, but nonetheless quite delicious, and perfectly seasoned.The chips deserve a mention also. \u00a0Very lightly crisp on the oustide but so soft, and so hot on the inside. \u00a0Again, the common theme at Sea Shells was that none of it was battered heavily, or fried to a ,massive crisp. \u00a0For someone like me who doesn't really like overly crisp things - - this restaurant hit a homerun.My dish cost about 12 pounds, if I recall correctly. \u00a0When ordering, you get a choice of about 5 fish, including the common cod and a rock salmon. \u00a0I ordered the haddock, which was precisely what I wanted - thick, juicy, and flaky. \u00a0The serving was generous, and while I devoured the whole fish before Rob was even halfway through his, I found that I had barely any room left for the chips. \u00a0Keep in mind that I did finish the calamari virtually by myself first.In any case, I feel really lucky to have dined at Sea Shell. \u00a0I'd go here time and again as my first meal when in London. \u00a0Touristy? \u00a0Perhaps. \u00a0But I maintain that tourist food is not necessarily bad food, and places like Sea Shell are the exception.",

    "text": "Firstly, this review is being written by an American from Wisconsin, home of the Friday Night Fish Fry...which is, in essence, the British Fish and Chips experience with a few subtle differences...we know our fish frys!Several people had recommended this establishment for the 'best fish and chips in London', so my fiance' and I were eager to try it out. \u00a0 It was with some excitement when we found out that the group we were in London with included lunch at the Seashell as part of the package. \u00a0 However, I think that the size of the group (20+ arriving on a bus all at once) had some effect on the experience, which I'll detail in a bit.Firstly, if you just want fish and chips, go to the takeaway area and order there. \u00a0It's about 1/2 the price of the sit-down, and in this reviewer's opinion, there's not much that you're missing. \u00a0 I give the sit down experience 3 stars and the waitstaff 2 stars. \u00a0It was stuffy, hot and the service was slow. \u00a0We weren't served the drinks that we ordered before the meal until we were nearly done with the meal. \u00a0Skip all that and carry-out.The fish was outstanding. \u00a05 stars on that!!! I'd give the fish more than 5 stars if I could. \u00a0The chips....they don't salt them like Americans do, so if you lay on some sea salt and malt vinegar, they're delicious. \u00a0 I'd give them 5 stars, but my fiance' didn't care for them at all. \u00a0 We also were served apple pie with custard. \u00a0Custard was delicious. \u00a0Skip the pie if you like a sweet apple pie, as is made in the U.S. \u00a0This one is a tart pie, and probably very well made for what it's supposed to be, but didn't appeal to the American palette.Overall, great fish, good chips if you like a very crisp chip and if you remember to salt and vinegar the hell out of them, and generous portions. \u00a04 stars overall.",

This place caught my attention, and needless to say, I had high expectation coming to this joint and I certainly was not disappointed. I ordered cod, chips, and an order of fish cakes. The cod was fresh, made to order. The batter was medium-thick and crispy, without too much grease. The chips were done right, and the fishcakes were fresh too. They were not cheap, but the portions were big (I wasn't able to finish my order although I was starving). Service was friendly - the girl behind the counter was very helpful.

Big selection of fish from your normal cod to skate to salmon. The fish come bland and is designed for you to add your own condiments. My favorite combo is lemon+malt vinegar+salt. You can't go wrong with the cod, but watch out for the skate. Skate (think stingray) takes longer to make and has a TON of soft bones. A good meal will set you back 10-15 quids per person.Tip: The street facing shop is a quick to-go service joint but swing around the back and you'll find the sit-down restaurant portion.",

This place is very kid friendly and the people who work here are very helpful. I asked for a sample of the mashed peas and they gave me a whole cup. If you have about 3 people with you, 2 fish and chips is enough because they are a pretty big portion. Overall, I was really pleased and impressed.",

Because when I'm on vacation I want to spend time a hotel) was Sea Shell. We were sold. When we arrived it was about 45min to closing (long day of sightseeing) and left less then welcome by our female server. Sorry for enjoying your city and then wanting a good fish and chip. However, at the end of our meal a different server assisted us and he was far more pleasant.My sister and I shared the fish & chip and the session pie. The fish and chips were good but I could easily get this back home (Wisconsin, USA) at our church's Friday fish fry. We also shared the fish pie. I felt as though the chef forgot to add the seasonings. I did have an excellent red wine, Rioja.Overall, Sea Shell had a lovely atmosphere and a good meal. You could tell it was made with love just not enough seasoning.. And I bet on a second trip and different selections I would probably have a better review.",

I had the sea bass fish and chips and my wife had the sole (apparently this is the only way fish and chips should be). The food came within a few minutes and the fish was fried perfectly. It was crispy, fresh, and not oily at all. The fries were just as good. It was quite hard to find, but well worth the search. I would definitely recommend this place to all visitors.",

The menu has a whole page on the different varieties of fish that you can have battered. Did I also mention that the fries that come with it are unlimited?!!I was pretty basic and went with the cod and a side of salad. The piece of cod I received was fresh, crispy, moist, and flaky; like what more can I ask for?! The portion was also bigger than any piece that I have had in the States. The salad was fresh and I loved the simple dressing on it. I also had a taste of my friend's chips, which were also yummy. Service was also top notch; our waitress was sweet and checked up on us often. Service fee is not included here, so remember to leave some tip! The only setback is that this place is sort of expensive, with the fish and chips starting at 15 quid and going up to 20. Otherwise I would be here every weekend lol. I would definitely recommend this place for proper fish and chips!",

The restaurant is a very higher end fish and chips place with nice decor and staff. This also raises the price of the dishes tho with the regular fish and chips being no less than 15\u00a3! I have to say it was the best fish and chips I've had though, the fry on the fish was light and coated it perfectly and the meat was tender and juicy. The fries were good but maybe could've been a little better but the tarter sauce was amazing as well. I'm not sure what they put in it but it just tastes much better than usual ones. Overall if your in marylebone come try lady Gagas favourite fish and chips and see what I'm talking about! Only if your willing to pay more than 18\u00a3 for a meal of a drink and fish a and chips.",

Maybe this is normal in the UK, but it grossed me out. Blech. No tartar sauce was given. Why does everything cost extra here? I didn't even think about having to request it until I had left the shop and there was no sauce.Last, I thought I was going to get a fountain drink with my meal deal (yay, ice!). Instead, I was offered a can of Pepsi when I requested a Coke, and it was warm. Nooooooo. I am ok with the can, but I am not so with the warm.",

Location is not unique enough. If you are a Japanese tourist you might love it.Sorry",

The service was also slow.The popcorn cod and fish filet was bland, oily, and didn't pair well with the tar tar sauce. The grilled seabass was good, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a typical \"fish & chips\" visit.All in all, good food, slow service, & wouldn't recommend to a visiting friend!",

In the last couple of years I started to go there less and less as the take away food has deteriorated so much that it is really rubbish. Last straw was last night when I bought a regular chips and got some dry, old,uneatable things that they call chips. Last time I'll go there it's crazy. And by the way if you at the restaurant read this post would you please clean the pavement outside with a steam cleaner like they used to do as it is caked in grease and oil and smells really bad in this weather.

    "text": "Seashell came recommended to us from our hotel concierge, we did check out our trusty yelp before heading out and they did have lots of hot and cold reviews. We just arrived in London and was staving, what better dinner then the original London favorite fish and chips! This being my first time in London I wanted to try the local fair cuisine. Disappointed is a bit strong, but I left seashells unsatisfied. It was FREEZING outside we decided to sit in the restaurant side rather then the take out, the atmosphere was a bit \"blah\" the bathroom is 3 flights of stairs down! Yes 3 flights, service we mediocre and so was the fish and chips. I had the cod, which over all was the best my friend had the Halibut and the other had the haddock, he returned his haddock for the cod. Was not crispy, I am a fan of crispy battered fried fish, Was a bit mushy and watery for my taste. You'll see my photo it's just \"blah\"I don't feel I'd return, sorry to report not the best food I had in London! However I did try another fish and chips place that was great! Stay tuned for another review",

They have a really nice selection that you can't find in the US or Singapore. Of course I ordered some side dishes and the good ol fish and chips. The portions are real huge here. Who knew? They put the chips first and then a large piece of fish. Of course I eat a lot and I got some side dishes. I am not very clear on this but I think they have clam fitters or something. Either way it's really nice. You can pick a nice brew here too if you are a beer person. Come by because it feels real good here.",

In the time it took to place our order and receive it, a homeless woman came storming around the corner yelling profanities and two cars came speeding past the storefront at carriageway speeds. Although these are no fault of the shop, let this be an indicator that one should probably not sit outside to eat. There is very limited seating inside and it's very warm from the stove and fryers going. As for the food, there seemed to be a broad selection of fish prepared in a variety of ways. We tried a cod fillet with chips on the side as well as popcorn fish and chips. The fish itself was well done, served hot and crisp, but the chips were a disappointment. They looked and tasted old, possibly re-cooked, and no amount of ketchup could make up for it. If I'm London again, I will likely try another place for traditional fish and chips.",

However, after consulting with the cashier on her recommendations of what was left, I ordered the haddock filet and chips. The meal came with a soft drink for 9 pounds. The haddock was cooked really well, with a good amount of batter and a lot of flavor - really easy to eat. It was also a really large fillet - the lady at the counter had to fold the ends a little bit just to fit it in the takeaway box. The chips were a little soggy, though that may be because I took this back to the flat to eat.",

Condiments? go grab whatever is left yourselves. We had some questions on the menu items which they answered, but they were just short and quick as if they were annoyed by us and didn't give off a friendly vibe. Food was Decent. Love that they're all in take away boxes so it's just easier to eat out of. \u00a0The servings are generous, there was no way for me to finish everything.

Although there was a line the service was very fast, very courteous and friendly. We had the cod, chips & whitebait. The fish was firm yet very moist. Not greasy AT ALL. Whitebait was also cooked perfectly. Lots of crunch, not greasy. Chips are usually not my thing but these were all but finished by us...that's really saying something. This restaurant is SO clean.

Then, at some point later on, it lost its status and ever since it seems to have been forgotten apart from, well, the people who haven't forgotten it and there still seem to be plenty of us plus lots of taxi drivers.It went through a rocky patch, quality-wise, a few years ago, but recently its been getting better and better....almost to perfection.The fish is delightfully fresh. The batter light and golden. The chips chunky and tasty. The portions nice and generous and all the extras I've tried, like mushy peas and coleslaw have been top notch. I'm referring to the takeaway, which also has an unfriendly stand-up eating area and a few grotty tables on the street. If you can, take your goodies home. They'll give you a good box if you ask them and it helps retain the heat.",

It's not fine dining, it's not asian-fusion cuisine nor mediterraneanit's good old fish & chipsand done very well!The restaurant is quite basic and informal however you should be going there for the food! Great for a lunchtim meal - go for the cod, chips and mushy peas - all you need! Real comfort food!Love it!",

The chips are beautifully chunky but no longer crisp, the fish is bland and served in flabby tasteless batter. One regular told me you had to go on a Friday if you wanted good, fresh-tasting fish, for some reason he reckoned it's not so good the rest of the week. For me, it was miles away from its heyday.",

You have not tasted fish and chips until you have tasted the delights of Sea Shell. The chips are crisp and chunky and the fish is always cooked perfectly and the batter is never too thick. The calamari and scampi are also very good. I have eaten in the restaurant but when I lived locally I regularly used the takeaway service. I have never been disappointed with the food and I can't wait to go back.",

I have not wanted to taint my tastebuds with substandard fish and chippy food, but this place made the wait worth it. Great service, friendly, really upmarket without being showy, clean and neat and far from the days of newspaper with the same if not better taste. The best fish and chips I have EVER eaten.",

    "text": "First time to London and wanted to find really good fish and chips. Read about Golden Hinde which was my first choice, but they were closed when we arrived. Ended up going to Sea Shell of Lisson Grove. The fish was huge and tasted light and fresh. The chips weren't as good since they were a bit hard and fishy-tasting. Overall it was good so a week later we went again. We heard another customer complain that he bit into ice in the fish and we were really surprised. Is the fish frozen? Then we got our order and when we cut open the fish, it was leaking a liquid, like water, as if they were fried when the fish was frozen. I suspect they didn't defrost enough fish and were cooking the fish when it was frozen. I was completely turned off and now would not recommend this place to anyone. Too bad I didn't have a chance to try Golden Hinde to compare.",

Always a line of people waiting, some local and some who clearly come just for the food theer (cab drivers). The setting and the crowd have personnality and it is simple and good, and frankly quite cheap. A great place to go if you visit the market next to it during the weekend or Alfie's, the antiques market.",

The big difference between the sea shell and other fish and chips is that these are fresh. It costs a little but more but the taste is excellant. When you gt fish and chips here you understand what good fish and chips should taste like. It is a shame there are not more around London like this instead of those awful Kebab or CHhicken places. I must go to the restaurant next door one day. Well worth a visit.",
