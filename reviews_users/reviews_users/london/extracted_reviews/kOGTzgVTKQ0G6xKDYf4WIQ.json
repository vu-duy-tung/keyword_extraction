Just the pizza margherita, please. It came within 5 minutes, testament to the furnace like oven which is needed for the best pizza. This pizza is one of the best I've had anywhere and was just as good as the pop up version but a bit bigger. When it comes to pizza, simple is best. Just a smear of sauce, a few blobs of moz, a few basil leaves. So simple, so good. The base is perfect, charred, bubbly, nicely chewy and flavoursome. My tip: add some of the chilli oil.AND the price is right. I think it was \u00a36.50.More proof that good food doesn't have to be expensive.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been a huge fan of Pizza Pilgrims in Soho and in Dalston (Street Feast), so it was inevitable that we'd try the one off Regent Street. Of all nights, we chose a freezing winter's night to do this, but after a hard workout with a nearby running group, all we wanted was pizza pizza pizza.Like the Soho location, this one is very small, so you'll probably end up having to wait for a bit during popular meal hours. Turning up at around 7:50pm, we still had to wait around 25 minutes. I'm not actually sure how long we waited, but it felt like ages because we had to wait outside in an outdoor seating area with NO heaters. It was almost tempting to go to Shoryu next door because they at least provided heaters for their outdoor-seated customers!Anyway, so if you come in wintery temperatures during lunch or dinner times, WRAP UP!Onto the food - the important stuff, obviously. We were starving, so we ordered fried artichokes with rosemary seasoning and fried tomato risotto balls in addition to our margherita pizzas. (Always a fan of the traditional dish!) Both starters/sides were DELICIOUS. The tomato risotto balls were soft, tomatoey and cheesy in all the right ways - just...wow. The artichokes were crispy and worked well with the seasoning. It's going to be hard not to order them the next time!Pizzas, as usual, were very good, but because ours didn't come out at the same time, mine was a bit cold by the time my husband's came. A bit of a bummer, but I still loved my pizza. Mmmmmm. \u00a0=)Other than that, I didn't love that there's a random high seater table in the middle of the basement, which we were seated at. It's rather uncomfortable and seems a bit out of place. I wish they could have just put regular tables there.So, 4 stars for the food continuing to be wonderful, but as a restaurant in general, just needs to work out some of the remaining kinks.",

I had the buffalo milk mozzarella on a margherita base - simple tomato and cheese. If anything the cheese had a slight vinegary taste which made think it wasn't 100% fresh. But other than that, great pizza and atmosphere for a quick, cheap and friendly meal. I'll be going back.",

It is fantastic to see a simple concept executed in such a successful manner and I am pleased to see the founders getting the formula spot on as far as tailored to Londoner's taste. With the right backers and high level quality control, Pizza Pilgrims has every chance to become a gourmet pizza chain, similar to what Franco Manca has become these days. It would be interesting to see where Pizza Pilgrims will be as a brand in a few years time.",

    "text": "As the people who know me best can attest, I really love pizza. It's safe to say the biggest adjustment for me in moving to London from the east coast of the US was the complete absence of on-the-go slice shops serving up piping hot, delicious slices at all hours of the day. Because of my deep-seated love for pizza, I'm constantly looking for London pizza joints to add to my arsenal, and I really wanted Pizza Pilgrims to be an addition.After hearing all kinds of rave reviews of Pizza Pilgrims, I giddily met some friends at the Carnaby branch before a movie on a Wednesday night. I've heard this no reservation joint gets busy, so I was worried we'd have to queue (which we did), but the actual waiting time was probably only 15 minutes compared to the quoted 40 so that was a relief. \u00a0We ordered 3 pizzas, the arancini balls, and fried artichokes to split between 4 of us. For pizzas, we got the margherita (a must order for any pizza connoisseur in my view), the portobello mushroom and truffle, and the guest pizza which had a bianca base, sausage, butternut squash and ricotta cheese. Overall, the crust was impressive and all the ingredients seemed very fresh. My favorite pizza was the margherita (really, how can you beat such a simple, perfectly balanced concept?) and I also really enjoyed the truffle pizza which was covered in deliciously pungent truffle oil. The guest pizza was a bit of a miss in my book. I didn't particularly think the flavors were great and there was more of a sprinkling of sausage rather than an actual topping. In terms of the sides, I'd definitely order the arancini balls again on a return visit.Overall, I was impressed with my Pizza Pilgrims experience, but not quite blown away (hence the 4 stars). That being said, it's a great option for a more casual, reasonably-priced dinner in central London. For those familiar with Franco Manca, I'd say Pizza Pilgrims is in the same vein in terms of crust, fresh ingredients and affordable prices. The waitstaff was also helpful and friendly, although they were fairly busy so their approach was a bit more hands-off. Definitely check it out!",

Be prepared, stepping here you'll eventually find:- loud but nice pop and modern music;- a very chaotic and nice south Italian style place;- very friendly and almost 85%italian staff;- very good and cheap Italian pizza (around 6 pounds for a margherita);During my visit, at 10 20 pm, the kitchen was about to close. I ordered my pizza and waited; the guys of the staff at the oven, once prepared the last pizzas, kept cleaning everything in a very, very, very loud way. Screaming out loud, joking between each other, not really good words, in Italian. But actually there were still customers at tables: some English ones must have thought they and all Italians are unrefined, as well as not good mannered. All of this could have been really annoying, but for all the time was funny though. Most important: pizza was awesome, good taste and ingredients, cheap as I mentioned before. No wifi but can use the public Carnaby street one. #crazy#italian#place#",

It's not for everyone, and especially not for those who love their pizzas with loads of cheese and tomato ketchup.If you are keen to eat here, make sure you are ready to wait or ensure that you go in a large group (they only do reservations for large groups). Waiting periods can range from 5 minutes to 45 minutes (probably longer; 45 minutes is the longest I have waited). TIP: try to turn up by 7:00 PM to get a table quicker.The service team is helpful and cheerful.One thing I don't like about them - the wine is served in water glasses. A bit tacky for me. One service staff passed it off as \"part of the ambiance\". They should get quirky glasses if they really want glasses to \"go with the ambiance\". Great atmosphere outside in the Kingly Court square. Want to try the downstairs seating, which looks good, especially if you want some music going. They were playing some sappy music the last time though.All in all, go for the food and the atmosphere.",

I can get onboard with these pizzas- I imagine this is how the italians do it and we know their the pros.

    "text": "While exploring London through food, I heard I HAD to try Pizza Pilgrims. So when two of my friends came to visit me, I figured it was a good time to take them here. I choose the place in Kingly Court because it was a sunny day and I wanted to eat outside. And it was lovely indeed ! Just try to arrive early and book a table on the waiting list (it was a week day and we waited 30 minutes)But we barely had time to wait and begin our drinks that our table was ready ! :)I had the pizza of the day (a carbonara !) while my friends took the pizza with aubergine and one with sausage and mozzarella.My friend was a little bit disappointed with the mozzarella : you have to pay extra 2,50\u00a3 to have some, and he didn't feel there were much on his pizza.Mine was really really good !! I can understand why everybody is talking about this place. Maybe the regular menu is a little bit to classic ? But the special pizzas are perfect !",

There's almost always a wait to get a table but it's so worth it - tasty freshly made pizzas costing under a tenner. You can wait outside on the benches though - they've got outdoor heaters! Inside is noisy and hectic - but in a nice way. Maybe cos it's so hip hahaThe cocktails are pretty good too but quite small.",

    "text": "Ok, if you are not giving this place a full 5 stars there are 2 options: You are cheating or you do understand nothing about pizza. There are no other options.I mean damn, it's a damn Pizza place, yes it's in central London, but IT'S A DAMN PIZZA PLACE. If you get it, then come here and EAT A DAMN PIZZA. You don't look for fries, you don't look for salads, YOU LOOK FOR PIZZA. PIZZA. PIZZA. DAMN PIZZA.Ok sorry but I get nervous when I read stupid reviews from people who do not understand what a place is about, they are the same people who get to Rome thinking people would greet them with a carbonara dressed as Giulio Cesare. DamnAs you can imagine this is one of my favourite places for having a pizza: it definitely is in my top 3 for pizza in central London, joining the other pilgrims and Franco Manca in tottenham CR.Short menu (yes short menus, less ingredients and more care about the dough, if you do not agree go to pizza hut) with 5-6 common pizzas and a guest pizza, a series of fried options (they go by the name \"Cuoppo\", which is the paper container they usually serve fried on-the-go food in in Napoli). Stop, full point, that's it.And pizza is damn delicious. Not too salty, with a big cornicione, nothing undercooked or overcooked, just pure perfection of a dough. My lady can't usually finish her pizza, and this is the only place where she can get to the end without feeling swelled.Just a suggestion: if you care about having a delicious napoli style pizza then this is a place you should definitely check out (and the other pilgrims too), otherwise go to pizza express and do not bother with this place, as this place is pretty crowded and you are just stealing time to pizza lovers who deserve this more than you.PS: they do not take reservation of any kind, my suggestion is just to come here, leave your name and get back when the table is ready, Kingly st is crowded with bars and pubs and it won't get complicated to find a place where to spend an hour waiting for it!",

We were seated by the door where each opening bathed us in the cold air and smoke. The waitress returned and thrusted tacky menus in front of us, where a can of coke is \u00a32 (wow!).The staff in General were very unprofessional (\"hi guys\" is not what I'm spending money for in Central london). The only saving grace was the food - there was a cheese-free option, which I pounced on immediately. The waitress offered artichoke hearts when I asked if they sold fries. Oh dear.",

The have a few tables that could be for bigger parties but I would call and double check if your party is larger than 4. The space is very tight. I hate cigarettes and I hate cigarette smoking, but most of all I hate cigarette smoke while I'm eating. It's absolutely disgusting.if you feel the same way I recommend asking for a table in the middle of the plaza or in the front of the restaurant. We were sat in the back of the restaurant right next to the outdoor seating and we left sooner because of it. Back to the food. We got two pizza's, one margherita pizza and one portobello mushroom pizza. Both were delicious and I recommend either. The only thing I wish is if they could put more basil on the margherita pizza... I know it's not standard... but the basil really is a key player in this pizza alongside the cheese.",

And if necessary, it's hearty enough to feed two. Pizza Pilgrims has several locations throughout London, so you'll always be able to find a cheap meal wherever you are. Think of it as a more upscale, sit-down version of New York's ubiquitous dollar slices, but so much better. (Is that a stretch? Who cares, I love Pizza Pilgrims.)Kingly Court is a popular place to grab a meal. Keep an eye out for the unassuming entrance and place your pizza order. It gets fairly crowded inside of Pizza Pilgrims, but there's ample seating in the hip outside courtyard (and heaters in the winter!). Yes, there will probably be a bit of a wait, but the pizza is worth it. The dough is delightfully chewy and there is a perfect cheese-to-sauce ratio. The decor is trendy, although not annoyingly so, both inside and out... and even in the restrooms, creating a welcoming dining atmosphere.In crust we trust.",

    "text": "Went again recently and have been here a few times as the office is a 2min walk away. Very friendly staff and order to delivery of pizza was extremely fast. Went with 3 other friends and all really liked their pizzas and their first time so thumbs up from all guests. We had the Salami and Salsiccia e Friarielli pizzas and very fresh tasting. The Salami is not the pepperoni you may be used to but if you like pepperoni you will not be dissapointed. All pizzas cooked in the stone oven and thin and crispy base with a good edge. Highly recommend although a reasonably limited menu there should be something any party will enjoy. Cost is reasonable given the location to be honest at \u00a310 per pizza.One quirky thing is wine is served in normal glasses not wine glasses but not really an issue i guess.",

    "text": "Well colour me converted! I had heard of Pizza Pilgrims a lot, mainly through their \u00a0pop up, but had never been to one of their actual locations. It's based under my yoga studio so my boyfriend met me and we popped in for a date. I didn't want to eat a lot of pizza that night (don't ask, I'm a people pleaser and he wanted to go there) so I asked if I could get a bigger side salad. The server didn't even bat an eyelid and said 'sure, it's called the secret salad' and is essentially a large version of their mozzarella side salad. I was delighted with it, so fresh and green but also with some naughty decadence of fresh mozzarella. I sound like a wanker, their pizza is fantastic but I was happy they could offer a healthier option too. We also ordered the mushroom and truffle white pizza and the aranchini balls. I LOVED the truffle pizza, I had one slice and was in pizza heaven. We picked that because the regular pizzas looked like they had so much tomato sauce and I hate that so this was fantastic. So cheesy with a real hit of truffle throughout and a squidgy, doughy base. Yes! I can also recommend the aranchini balls if you are extra hungry. They are served pipping hot and very tasty.",

    "text": "After seeing Pizza Pilgrims on social media just as I moved away from London, I was keen to try their pizza now that I'm back! It did not disappoint! It is some of the best pizza I've had in London. It managed to have a thin base and a fluffy texture at the same time, brilliant! My friend and I shared the mushroom and truffle oil pizza, which was great for a quick bite to eat, for a main meal, I would probably recommend one pizza per person. The pizza was delicious! I do love my truffle! I've never gone for pizza without a tomato base before, as I love my tomatoes, but it was a welcome change and I will definitely do it again! The staff were really friendly and service was swift. I would say the place has a more casual feel to it, as it is decorated a bit like a diner, which I really liked, but I probably wouldn't come here for dinner as an evening out. I can't wait to return and try the other flavors!",
