I rather strangely ordered a Caesar Salad and it wasn't great - the chicken was dry. But the dressing was yum and the croutons were very good. I wasn't exactly eating much due to aforementioned hangover so maybe I'd have been happier if I was feeling OK. I did order a side of hashbrowns though and they were yummy indeed. Everyone else's lunch looked much nicer than mine - maybe I just chose the wrong thing. Still, I'm not sure my whole meal should have set me back over \u00a312. But that doesn't really explain why we had to wait so long. First before we sat down - we could see five or so empty tables, but we stood about for around ten minutes. Then we didn't get served for ages. Our food then took a good twenty minutes to arrive. Our waitress was nice, but we had to ask her if we could order and she looked a bit dazed. Maybe she was as hungover as us. I want to like it here, but I wasn't overly blown away with the Soho branch either - it's just a stop gap. Nothing special. The food is sometimes good, but service is very hit and miss. It's a nice place, but after trying Diner a couple of times, I might have to look elsewhere for my American food fix.",

Incredibly authentic and eclectic menu, so vast that I'm sure you could eat here every week for an entire year and never eat the same thing twice. Popped here for a hot choc and short stack of pancakes with my friend yesterday afternoon and then stayed and waited for my boyfriend to join me for dinner before heading to the Garage for a gig. It cost us around \u00a330 for 2 root beer floats, a burger each and some cheese fries, which is a little on the expensive side, but definitely worth it as the quality of the food is great and the service was fantastic. Will definitely be returning and looking up the one off of Carnaby St which is closer to the Saaf where we live. They could definitely do with opening one south of the river too. They'd make a killing in Clapham/Battersea!",

I've thought this for a while and every now and then I revisit one of the restaurants in the hope of reviving my The Diner experience. Every time I'm left disappointed however. I went to the Angel restaurant over the weekend and had the Eggs Benedict; the muffins were stale, the hollandaise sauce was cold and the whole thing was just a bit meh.

    "text": "Strangely, despite it's bad rep, I always have a great time when I go to this branch of the Diner. Perhaps it's the company (I only ever go here to meet one of my close friends - and our monthly meal is now the only time I see her) but I've also enjoyed the food too. Usually, we meet for brunch and I get pancakes with a side of chorizo. Sweet blueberry pancakes with spicy chorizo is just a flavour win in my book. This time, however, it was to try to Diablo burger which is rumoured to be one of the best in London. As a self proclaimed burger aficionado, I had to try it to find out.First off, the damn thing is massive so a size win! Too often, the burger is tasty but too small to really satisfy (I'm looking at you, Burger & Shake). This thing is a hefty two-hander with a patty the size of some longhorn cattle. The patty was a tad over cooked (more medium than requested medium rare) but still juicy enough to be enjoyable. The meat selection could have done with a bit more beefy sirloin taste to give it more body. So, decent patty but not worthy of a top spot by any measure.The bun was a bit boring to be honest and fell apart halfway through. I think it was a generic white bread bun so overall - epic fail.Toppings consisted of melted cheese and lots of chilli. Now this was my type of burger! Sadly, while tasty, it lacked the level of heat I had been led to expect and had hoped for. Maybe for the average Englishman it was on fire, but for one brought up on curry instead of applesauce, it just wasn't good enough.Overall, a perfectly enjoyable burger although a bit pricey at around 13 squids. I won't be back for the burger (but will be for pancakes and the company) as there are many better tasting and better value options around!",

The menu was creative in their take on American foods (macaroni and cheese pops anyone?) and everything was absolutely delicious. The buttered rum was pretty weak both in terms of flavour and rum, but at least they tried. Now after all the effort, none of the music was American. Having asked about the tunes, the poor waitress informed us she had no say in the music and had a few people pointing out the same misstep. \u00a0The complaint I do have is that the dessert was incredibly poor, and two of my group had paper in our desserts. Obviously our dessert were shipped to the restaurant, and the paper that wrapped it was included. I am guessing because we lacked fiber in our diets.",

Our waitress came over and we were all in quite a silly, hungover, jokey mood - she did not want to join in....or smile for that matter. All of our food arrived at different times - two people had to wait ages for theirs. We were all almost finished by the time it arrived. The food was ok - but not worth the price at all - could of gone to a greasy spoon...... you get the tiniest pot of maple syrup too if you order pancakes :( This place could be really good if they just stepped it up a little.

    "text": "The Diner @ Islington - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) In my quest to find the best burger in London, Dr G and I went to The Diner on Essex Road, Islington. It was well after 10pm and only a day before New Year 's Eve when we visited, but this newly opened American style diner was reasonably busy. The decor recreates an American 1950s diner, with booths of red leatherette chairs and long formica tables. The menu looked impressive with a long list of all day breakfast items, costing between \u00a36 and \u00a38.50, like blueberry or banana pancakes, huevos rancheros, and eggs Benedict among others.Drink choices were also extensive \u00a0The Diner sells beer by the bottle or on draught with a pint of lager costing as little as \u00a33.20. Milkshakes are priced at \u00a34.20 while hardshakes (alcoholic milkshakes) cost \u00a37. I ordered a Creamy Nut Hardshake (hazelnut and pistachio ice-creams with Baileys) @ \u00a37. This took a little while to arrive but was well worth the wait as it was indeed very creamy, nutty and surprisingly alcoholic. Soon enough the rest of our order arrived. I went for the Californian Burger (Monterey Jack cheese and Guacamole) @ \u00a36.20. All burgers are served with tomato, lettuce, red onions, gherkins and relish. It looked well presented and the 7 oz patty was quite chunky. As I bit into the burger my heart sank \u00a0the bread was not only cold but it was hard and stale; the meat was completely tasteless and overcooked (I had ordered it medium) and the guacamole tasted straight out of a jar.Dr G had ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich (Swiss cheese and grilled onions) @ \u00a37. Again this was disappointing \u00a0stale and chewy bread, gristly meat making the sandwich virtually inedible. To accompany our sandwiches, we also made the mistake of ordering a portion of Diner's Chilli Cheese Fries (topped with cheese and hot chilli beef) @ \u00a33.50. The fries were not only cold but were also hard, undercooked and greasy. I really cannot find anything positive to say about these fries and the greasy, synthetic orange cheese smothered over the most undistinguished chilli beef. Verdict \u00a0one of the worst burgers I have ever eaten, stale bread, and under-cooked, greasy fries. Good hardshakes were the only redeeming feature. There are many better options for a burger in Islington and London. Stay away!",

Cutting corners and charging for every little extra \u00e0 la that great British bastion of cut price travel.Don't get me wrong. I like the concept. Diner is as bright and quirky as its invariably hot staff. Its menu epic and at times original but alas the quality of its food simply isn't up to scratch. I ordered the Cajun Spiced Chicken Burger for a hearty \u00a36.50 plus \u00a30.70 - SEVENTY PENCE! - for a slice of cheese and was greeted by an unexceptional and battered looking bit of what resembled reconstituted chicken with a decidedly un-cajun flavoured crust. Must try harder.",

    "text": "The Diner @ Islington - Pics at The London FoodieIn my quest to find the \"best\" burger in London, Dr G and I went to The Diner on Essex Road, Islington. It was well after 10pm and only a day before New Year 's Eve when we visited, but this newly opened American style diner was reasonably busy.The decor recreates an American 1950s diner, with booths of red leatherette chairs and long formica tables.The menu looked impressive with a long list of all day breakfast items, costing between \u00a36 and \u00a38.50, like blueberry or banana pancakes, huevos rancheros, and eggs Benedict among others.Drink choices were also extensive - The Diner sells beer by the bottle or on draught with a pint of lager costing as little as \u00a33.20. Milkshakes are priced at \u00a34.20 while \"hardshakes\" (alcoholic milkshakes) cost \u00a37.I ordered a \"Creamy Nut Hardshake\" (hazelnut and pistachio ice-creams with Baileys) @ \u00a37. This took a little while to arrive but was well worth the wait as it was indeed very creamy, nutty and surprisingly alcoholic.Soon enough the rest of our order arrived. I went for the \"Californian Burger\" (Monterey Jack cheese and Guacamole) @ \u00a36.20. All burgers are served with tomato, lettuce, red onions, gherkins and relish. It looked well presented and the 7 oz patty was quite chunky. As I bit into the burger my heart sank - the bread was not only cold but it was hard and stale; the meat was completely tasteless and overcooked (I had ordered it medium) and the guacamole tasted straight out of a jar.Dr G had ordered the \"Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich\" (Swiss cheese and grilled onions) @ \u00a37. Again this was disappointing - stale and chewy bread, gristly meat making the sandwich virtually inedible.To accompany our sandwiches, we also made the mistake of ordering a portion of Diner's \"Chilli Cheese Fries\" (topped with cheese and hot chilli beef) @ \u00a33.50. The fries were not only cold but were also hard, undercooked and greasy. I really cannot find anything positive to say about these fries and the greasy, synthetic orange cheese smothered over the most undistinguished chilli beef.Verdict - one of the worst burgers I have ever eaten, stale bread, and under-cooked, greasy fries. Good \"hardshakes\" were the only redeeming feature. There are many better options for a burger in Islington and London. Stay away!",

    "text": "As a chain, I'm a big fan of The Diner. But I think that just enhances my disappointment when I visit this branch, as I know how much better it could be. I've visited this branch on 3 occasions now, and my experience has always been the same. We're now at the point at which it isn't worth giving them another go.This time I visited on a Saturday afternoon, at which time there were only 4 other parties seated. Yet service and length of time to receive anything was abysmal. 10 minutes to have our drinks order taken, another 20 to receive those drinks. And another 20 for our food.We ordered 2 starters (bacon jalape\u00f1o tater tots and freakshow chicken), 2 burgers (cheeseburger and the Diablo) and sweet potato fries with garlic butter. Annoyingly our starters arrived at the same time as our burgers, despite me being clear at the time of ordering that they were wanted as starters.As it has been every time I've been to this branch, my burger was overcooked. The server did actually ask how I would like it cooked, and as medium rare is as rare as they'll do, that was my choice. She may as well have not bothered as my burger could only be described as well done. Very disappointing. The Diablo is actually one of my favourite burgers in London when cooked properly, as it has been at every other branch of The Diner that I've visited. So for me to only want to eat half of it speaks volumes.My companion had similar thoughts on his cheeseburger - which actually had very little cheese.The rest of the food was lovely. I highly recommend the tater tots.",

    "text": "Had a very interesting experience here. Interesting because it started off really bad and then turned out relatively OK at the end.To start off, I was really leery on going here, as, a straight up NYer, I know diners, and I know diners well, and I'm really sceptical London can replicate diner awesomeness. (In some respects, it already fails as it closes at midnight. No self-respecting diner in NY or NJ does that).We arrived here last Saturday night, around 11pm, feeling hangry after drinking at an all-day party. I got the vegan breakfast (Mushrooms, chickpea patties, spinach, tomatoes, avocado and sesame sauce), my friend ordered the veggie breakfast burrito ( Scrambled eggs, black beans, spinach, mushrooms, guacamole and cheese with fruit) and my husband a burger.My husband wanted coffee and the waitress/manager told him the restaurant didn't serve it that late. It had stopped making it a few hours before. She said she had never gotten a request for coffee that late, which a) I found that hard to believe and b) seemed a dismissal of a customer's tastes. My husband was flabbergasted.Took a while for our food, like others have said. Mine was actually pretty tasty....but missing avo. My friend was served her burrito only to discover she was given the meat burrito. Now this is where it all starts to go downhill.My friend sent hers back and said she had requested the veg version; the manager said she had not and said to get the veg version she would have to pay for it. My friend agreed but we all agreed this is EXACTLY how shitty customer service in the UK plays out. I also told her my avo was missing and was asked, \"Do you still want it?\" Uh, I paid for this, so yes.I got my avo on a side plate, with apologies... and then the manager retracted her comments and ended up substituting the veg burrito at no extra charge. So, all in all, um ok???",

Things are starting to wear in the restaurant - the table we sat on is a bit wonky and the seat had a tear. The menu however has improved - I had the freakshow chicken, while Nickie had the corndogs and we shared a portion of the bacon covered tater tots and onion rings.They brought regular tater tots initially, but we sent them back and afterwards got the bacon covered type. The portions are good - the corn dog basket comes with two corn dogs, the onion rings could have still been served to someone else after we ate all the ones we wanted. I particularly liked the freakshow chicken - buttermilk fried chicken strips served with Frank's wing sauce. They don't say it's Franks, but I know that taste (it's my preferred hot sauce) and so I was very happy with that. In fact, I'd say that chicken was the best thing I've had here. I appreciate the tots and the corndogs - those aren't easy to find in the UK, but the corndogs aren't battered and fried to order, they've certainly been fried beforehand and then re-heated. They took a while to take our plates away - I suspect because the portions were so big that our plates didn't look entirely clear. After ten minutes of waiting I stacked the baskets and they got the hint at that point. Like I said, overall it was fine.",

I thought I didn't even much like it there until I tried another branch and realised that I do like it, so I came back to this one, thinking it was the passage of time that had improved the chain.Unfortunately this branch is still mediocre. I got the same food I had at the Seven Dials branch a couple of months ago, and here it wasn't as good, nor was the service as good. I had corn dogs and bacon & jalape\u00f1o tater tots. We were the only people there, pretty much, and our food was still slow to come - and then it was wrong. They brought me a basket of plain tots, and when I said that wasn't what I ordered, they were whisked away without much of an apology, and the replacement was slow to come. When they finally came, when I was more than halfway done (even though I was eating slowly) they were fine, but the cheese sauce dip came cold - like fridge cold, instead of melted like the other branch. Plus the jalapenos were red - now, I know jalapenos do come in a red variety, but it's not something I've come across in London before. I assume these were not jalapenos (as they were spicer) and I would have preferred a heads up.The corn dogs were nice.Definitely avoiding this branch in the future. There was no atmosphere - the music stopped abruptly for a good 5 minutes, and when it came back on, it was so loud we couldn't speak any more (we were still pretty much the only table there). The booth seating was cracked and uncomfortable. You could be so much better, Diner.",

The overall opinion: not great, but some surprisingly decent things:The good: My cheeseburger was really pretty great. Topped just how I asked for it to be, and cooked to perfection. Also, I saw they have chili cheese fries, but they also have tater tots under the breakfast menu. So, I asked if they'd make me chili cheese tater tots, and while they weren't totally authentic, they were totally tasty. I'd have that again. The bad: The service. They were totally nice, but completely understaffed... one girl tending bar, and one guy running around doing seemingly all of the waiting. I'm actually writing this review while I wait on my bill, and have waited for about 15 minutes. (Editorial note: the guy came around with the bill about a minute after I wrote that.) No fault of the people working here... they're working their tails off... but they desperately need more front of house staff. Don't expect efficient service. The ugly: The milkshake. Oy...this was bad. I got a chocolate peanut butter milkshake, and it just wasn't good at all. Very soupy, barely a taste of peanut butter to it at all, and for some random reason there were chocolate chips that kept being sucked up in my straw. I have never had a chocolate shake that featured chocolate chips... a truly odd choice. I really can recommend the hamburger...it was good. But the next time I need my American fix, I'm walking a block over to Five Guys.",

The American-style pancakes were dense and tasted a lot like lemons, which I found vexing. Being an American, I know my pancakes and these were not it.I also had to be That American and sent my eggs back. I really *really* didn't want to, but for \u00a310 for a simple breakfast, I needed to. They were inedible. Ordered \"scrambled\" got \"fried and minced up with a spatula\" and while I would've shut up and eaten that, they were also underdone with shimmying runny whites. Nope. Nope nope.The bacon was bacony. The service, again, was sweet and she took my egg-return in stride without no side-eye or anything. I did take *forever* to get our bill, but I've found that to be the case everywhere I've been thus far in London. It's like they never want you to leave. I love you, London restaurants, but we have places to be!I liked that The Diner had alright bottomless filter coffee for \u00a32.80, which I'll now take advantage of with my laptop and their wi-fi, as I'll inevitably be back since it's right up the street.Plus, I've heard about the boozy shakes and cheese fries now and I'm no fool.",

    "text": "Love going here for their milkshakes and more Americanized stuff like pancakes and crispy bacon and hash browns. Went earlier today and had amazing door stop slab of cornbread topped with smashed avocado and chilli, poached eggs and crispy bacon - washed down with a peanut butter milkshake. Seriously yum. Only reason for 3/5 is their decor is becoming really tatty (quite a few ripped seat covers) and usually we have to ask to have the table wiped down. Shame as the food and service is always good.",

What really makes the flavour here is the amazing burger sauce!! So tasty and moreish. Also the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would go back here.",

    "text": "I will preface this review by saying I really enjoy the food at The Diner, and I have had much better experiences at other locations. I am American, and whenever I crave a good ol' burger in London I think of this chain. That being said...I couldn't believe how terrible the service was when we ate at this location back in December. There was a booth just for staff where they are allowed to essentially sit, chat, and play on their phones. I was floored. That is basically all they did while we were there. It was near impossible to get anyone's attention.We were really disappointed. They never even offered to bring us another round of drinks. Also, there were two tables seated near us filled with people who I can only assume were off schedule coworkers. When a waitress did come near our table it was only to fraternize with their friends before going back to the booth. Really unprofessional.",

    "text": "I would first like to mention that I was tempted to give this place more stars just to pull up the average! Lots of old one star reviews that certainly didn't reflect my own experience. There's a good choice of food here, which once ordered is served piping hot within a reasonable time of ordering from my experience. I enjoyed my meatloaf, although the mashed potatoes were a little too authentically American Diner-y for my liking- sloppy and tasteless. My partner had a steak sandwich- of which was served rare just as he had requested. He assures me that it was very tasty. His additional side of onion rings were beer battered and so crispy that I had to 'help him out' with a few of them ;) The reason this place doesn't get higher than an average rating is the staff. They somehow make a very small chain restaurant feel like a very large chain restaurant. As in they don't seem enthused about anything that they're doing etcetera. This could be due to the fact that service charge is added to your bill, so they don't feel like they have to earn it etc. Nobody was particularly rude so we paid the charge, but we had multiple uncaring servers so wouldn't have tipped otherwise. Milkshakes, coke floats and diner booths along with good standard American food make this a place that's A-ok for lunch around Islington though.",

It's actually so frustrating that I've started getting my food to go and just eating it at home, that was I can get a drink when I need one. I do appreciate this place for having French's mustard though. What a nice American touch!",

    "text": "We went for breakfast. It was disastrous. Ages to get seated. Ages to order. Then absolutely AGES to get food. 45 minutes for pancakes? And when we asked where they were we were told it was because they were made from scratch....1) making pancake batter from scratch takes approximately 3 minutes2) why are you making it from scratch when it should really stand for a while anyway3) I don't believe you45 minutes later, our food NEARLY made it to the table before being spectacularly launched into the air off the tray by the waitress, to land in a puddle on the floor right next to us. I nearly cried in frustration. Then the order was wrong. We had to raise our voices and get rather cross to get a discount on a breakfast which took an hour to arrive, was incorrect, and didn't taste that great anyway. It was greasy.The staff were both unfriendly and complacent.The coffee was lukewarm and too small, and not really a flat white. Don't go here for breakfast. Or in fact at all. .",

    "text": "Feels like America when I was eating here. This place offers you a range of burger selection complete with the sides you have been craving for and milkshakes. Their burger is mouthful, it literally is the size of my mouth. But it tasted so well, even better with the fries and a bit of jalape\u00f1o to spice it up. The staff was wonderful. They asked me how I want the meat to be and recommended if I wanted any sides with it. When my food came, it looked so yummy and made me decided to put away the utensils and ate it with bare hands instead. The beef patty was just like the way I wanted it and it comes with bright red jalape\u00f1o and blue cheese, all served to perfection. All the fries were good. The sweet potato was special and cheesy fries was absolutely luscious. I could still smell the blue cheese and onion on my fingers after the diner. But I loved it. It made me want to come back.",
