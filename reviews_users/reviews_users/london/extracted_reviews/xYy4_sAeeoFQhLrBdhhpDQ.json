I had a tub with both a large scoop of matcha and mango ice cream, would sum it up as good treat. Not a great one though I'm afraid. Main reason I gave them 4* is because of the Mango. Would recommend Yorica to anyone looking for a guilt free treat. I am also unable to have dairy and if you're the same then I would recommend this is safe place to indulge!",

    "text": "I'm sorry. I'm actually really very sorry that I just don't find the desserts here all that good. Minus two stars because FOR ME, as someone who has gluten intolerance, I felt worse eating it because it just didn't taste good.It's gluten/dairy/egg/etc free but omg, just no.And I'm gonna keep saying sorry because I totally respect what this little store offers people who have severe allergies--a taste of \"normal\" desserts. But unfortunately to me those desserts taste like candle wax. I am sitting in the store right now staring at my fusion crepe something that I paid an extra pound for to have a scoop of cookies n cream \"ice cream.\" It was at first Instagram-worthy. It's now a melted dark brown pool that looks disturbingly like something I will probably be excreting out of me later on the loo. I couldn't eat more than 3 bites of the crepe. Side note: and yes I'm American so I pronounced it \"krayp\" when I ordered it and was corrected when the girl repeated back to me, \"A krehp?\" The ice cream has an obvious hint of coconut and the brownie topping I also got is obviously made with dates. I like coconut! I like dates/Lara bars! But here it was somehow overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time and I just feel really yucky and once I'm done writing this review I'm gonna Yelp the nearest bar (which is most likely a few doors down here in Soho).So three stars because bravo to you Yorica for offering a dessert haven for people who otherwise can't eat them. But I really am sorry I did not personally like it. A previous review I read said it best: come here and order something only if you really are allergic to gluten/dairy/eggs/nuts.",

Whatever the weather the next time I was in London I was getting an ice cream and I am delighted to say it did not disappoint. The ice creams are gorgeous and creamy, even hardcore fans of the real dairy filled stuff will not be disappointed! My dairy & sugar fiend husband will testify to that! The staff were lovely and helpful and will let you try flavours before you buy if you are unsure. There was a brilliant range of flavours and toppings. Just genuinely couldn't be more thrilled that London is finally cottoning on to the giant hole in the market and that I no longer have to be stuck with the sorbet only option!",

Their ice cream are made with rice milk I think or maybe just the frozen yogurt, I didn't ask for the ice cream but i was very happy that it wasn't soya like a lot of places. Many flavours and toppings to choose. I tried the vanilla frozen yoghurt which was very nice, and a crepe (French pancake) even the non vegan friend that went with me loved it and said she would come back which I think for any vegan place is a proof of quality.I came back and tried the peaNot butter ice cream with another non vegan friend and we were so amazed cause it tastes exactly like peanuts, I mean if you're allergic to nuts you HAVE to try it !!!! This is really amazing.Well this is sure gonna be a favourite and gonna keep trying other flavours. I didn't put 5 stars cause there is no toilets and I didn't like the brownie bits topping, i think it's made with soya but it is nothing like classic brownies.",

I had tried 3 flavours which Mango, Strawberry and Lychee. May be it is my personal preference, i think taste still need to improve to compete with amarino ice cream and snow flake shop.

But having read about Yorica last week I decided to stop by on Sunday afternoon. The shop was filled with people eating tubs of delicious ice creams and yogurts. We didn't have to wait too long to be served as there were plenty of staff to help you make your choices. We tried the WOWbutter and Choc orange Ice creams, both delicious. However I had my heart set on froyo. I combined vanilla and caramel and had brownies and strawberries for toppings. My friend had caramel with popcorn and pomegranate hearts. At just under \u00a310 it is on par with the other froyo joints around town, and I feel like you actually got more for your money. I had the medium size and did struggle to finish it. One thing to note about Yorica is the staff, they are super friendly and happy to assist you with any questions you have. Don't forget the free sprinkles on your way out!",

Choose from ice cream, ice cream cones (gluten free waffle cones), frozen yoghurt or shakes. I cannot remember the last time I had a milkshake so I indulged, ignoring how much I was paying because I miss milkshakes. And it was so worth it (I am sure those who normally have to go without also feel the same). The milkshake was around \u00a34.50 and included 4 scoops of ice cream. I initially thought the prices were a little steep, but to be honest they're just typical London prices and in line with the other desserts available on Wardour Street (Hummingbird, Gail's etc).And it is great to have a dessert place that everyone can enjoy. Not only is it dairy free, it is also gluten and nut free (their \"WOWButter\" ice cream is peanut butter flavoured but no peanuts were hurt in the making ;)).Our server was the absolute friendliest - she gave us tasters, taught us about the products and how they are made and recommended flavour combinations even though there was a queue behind us. We actually only went in to see what they were offering, but she won us over and we left with an amazing milkshake",

After only reading about the new opening earlier that week, I was really excited to try it out.As the UK's 1st Allergen free Ice Cream Bar with a wide range of flavours, I went for Cookies & Cream but my friends tried the Blackcurrant Mango and Matcha flavours, it's definitely stepped up to fill a gap in the market. I chose the Cookies & Cream Ice Cream and had it topped with Tiffin pieces and some Maple Cookie Crumbs. The Ice Cream itself was as lovely as I'd hoped it would be, so light and creamy with the slightest hints of coconut which I loved. The chewy Tiffin and crunchy Cookie toppings were great with it, I could hardly believe it was all completely Vegan.The fact that anyone can eat here because everything is free from wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs and nuts (or drink should they choose one of the Freefrom Milkshakes) along with the bright atmosphere and friendly service makes Yorica a really exciting addition to Soho. The only thing I could ask for would be some different serving options but I'm sure that will come with time and I look forward to visiting again to hopefully get one of the freshly made gluten free waffle cones!",

I'd recommend they consider adding more matcha to the soft serve mix. Other than that, they have many vegan ice creams, soft serve, and toppings (including vegan gummy bears and marshmallows). Head on over and give 'em a shot!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time about a month ago.LOCATION: It's in Soho, which is a typically-busy and upbeat area of the city, but this is towards the outskirts, so it's not too crazy, if that's a concern for you. 3/5ATMOSPHERE: It's very well put-together inside. All the decor matches really well and it's cute. It's not cheesy though, which is good -- like, the color schemes are simple, and nothing is too extra lol. 4/5SELECTION: It's an all-vegan dessert shop, best known for their soft serve (four flavors), but they also have ice cream (11 flavors), shakes (5 pre-set flavors, plus a create-your-own option), waffles, and crepes. A lot of it can be combined/mix-matched too -- like, combining soft serve with waffles, or ice cream with crepes. They've got lots of different toppings for it all too. It's also very allergy friendly too, even being vegan -- there's also no nuts or gluten in their items either. Most of it is also free of soy as well. P.S. you can ask to sample flavors. 4/5WHAT I GOT: I got the classic (the smallest) size of their Chilled Out Chocolate flavor of soft serve. It was great -- definitely in my list of top desserts, especially for the ice cream/soft serve/froyo category. It wasn't icy or too melty in texture -- nor too hard packed. It was nice and smooth. And the flavor was pretty good too -- definitely not overall sweet or anything. The chocolate flavor was there too -- if I had to point out any negative, I would just say turn up the chocolate just a tad. But, it was still good and I would definitely recommend it and the shop in general. Also, they have free sprinkles in these fancy contraptions that are on your right as you walk back towards the front of the store, away from the front counter. Don't be like me and forget they have them until you're almost done, especially if you didn't want to pay for any of the toppings behind the counter -- they make your dessert look instantly 10x prettier, especially for picture purposes haha. 4/5SERVICE: The service seemed pretty good. The employees were friendly and answered any questions we had well. 4/5",

The space is surprisingly large, with lots of table and bar seating. Free wifi and lots of outlets, which is always appreciated amidst a busy day of shopping. Yorica's menu offers an impressive variety of freshly made hard packed ice creams, soft serves, and even crepes. They also have unique vegan toppings that you may not find just anywhere, like \u00a0gummy bears, mini marshmallows, and cute miniature cookies.The girl working was genuinely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. I sampled a few of the hard packed flavors, including the Cookies and Creme, and the WowButter (peanut free!), both of which were excellent. Silky smooth texture packed with rich flavors. I wanted to try everything, but as a matcha superfan, I had to get the Matcha Soft Serve. I was not disappointed. The green tea flavor was prominent without being overpowering, and the texture was impressively creamy considering the rice milk base. Their fresh raspberry sauce was an very complimentary topping. However, the brownie chunks were gross-maybe because I'm not a gluten free person? They tasted like cardboard. Also, the sprinkles at the self serve sprinkle bar were extremely slate. I highly recommend Yorica! to vegans and folks with allergies, but would hesitate to bring a non-vegan here.",

You order in the way back of the store, and then the seating is all by the front end of the store. I really wanted to have the waffle and ice cream combo, but they were out of waffles =( very sad. We ordered the cookies and cream ice cream and green tea soft serve. Cookies and Cream ice cream was fantastic! texture and flavor wise so goood! The green tea soft serve was just ok. I think I was expecting more green tea flavor and maybe even, a sweeter taste. I would have liked to try another flavor. The texture was amazing! Perfect! Just the way I like my vegan soft serve. LOL I would love to come back again to try the waffle and other flavors! Highly recommend trying out this place.",

There are some colourful sprinkles you can decorate your dessert with for free and there are a handful of seats available inside and outside the store.

Yorica is a cute ice cream parlor, with friendly staff and there is seating inside (plus a bench outside for Soho people watching) if you wanted to enjoy your ice cream there. You can sample any flavors that you want before choosing. If you're expecting sweet classic froyo and ice cream, you might be a little put off at first as everything has a unique and raw taste. The ice cream isn't very creamy like traditional ice cream either. But that's a given, as there is no dairy in there. I would mix and match a couple flavors, and add some sauces and toppings for the ultimate combo. The hot dark chocolate sauce is the best, as it hardens when poured on top. Nothing leaves you feeling heavy, and there are unlimited free sprinkles if that's your thing.It's a little pricey after adding toppings and going full-out but worth a visit if you're in the area. Oh, and they've recently added waffles to the menu.",

    "text": "Newly opened and offering something seemingly absent from London til now, Yorica aims to provide vegan friendly treats in a allergen safe environment.It was busy when we arrived, quite something for a place that serves frozen treats in Winter! Or at least very early Spring. At the moment, ice cream, froyo and milkshakes are on offer but they aim to offer smoothies soon. The bad part is their organisation, the serving counter is at the very back and there was a large line, but this is partly to do with how the counter is set up. The it goes toppings, ice cream then pay, which I think is out of order. Surely ice cream should come first? The result is that customers would try ice cream and then move back down the queue to get toppings and then go to pay. Also staff weren't asking people to move down so that they could serve more customers. 4 people serving but they could only access 2... However the guy in charge reorganised the staff so that they were more efficient, so I can't fault them too much, but it did take a while for him to do that... The staff was seemingly fixed and I hope it sticks for the future, I chalk it up to teething problems now. As for the counter, well hopefully they can move things around.But on to the product. We each got a small cup, which at \u00a34.20 a pop is verging on steep. Toppings were an extra 65p each although there were some others available for free on the way out (but behind the long queue). They have a range of flavours, most fruit based but also chocolate and cookies and cream.We opted for white peach and wowbutter (more on that in a bit) and moringa (green tea) and black current, and once received were on our way. The texture is good, can't tell the difference. The flavours, well for the most part they're great, the fruit flavours are strong and really tasty. The green tea was like others I've had but could be a little stronger, just a tad light in my opinion. The wowbutter though, that was special. It's peanut butter but without the peanuts! It really does taste like peanut butter. It does have a slight aftertaste, nothing unpleasant but something lingers, probably whatever helped create the flavour. Something special though, nothing I've experienced before!So all in all, the product is great! Let down a little by service but nothing that can't be fixed. Like I said, probably teething problems so hopefully I won't experience that the next time. And there will probably most likely be a next time. In my opinion, on par with Snowflake which is one of the better ones in Soho in my opinion.",

Which was nice but I don't think I could have had a whole scoop of it! I ended up getting the cookies and cream and wowbutter in a small cup. Cookies and cream was wayyy better. Wowbutter didn't really have much flavour to it. It had some of that texture of peanut butter but without the actual taste. Despite that I could not bring myself to finish it... It tasted far too strongly of coconut or almonds or something that it quite often overpowered the ice cream flavour itself! Honestly I think it's only worth it if you're actually vegan or allergic to regular ice cream. Just my opinion....",

After visiting Yorica! I went for a second round to Gelupo and the comparison was not very far off! You could suspect Yorica of being less flavoursome but having tasted their Peanut Butter I assure you this is not the case. It was thick, rich and could put to shame more than one non-vegan produce! Granted, the stracciatella was much more light but I would say its a matter of personal taste. Bottom line - give Yorica! a try, regardless of your dietary preferences.",

    "text": "I was super excited when I heard Yorica was opening, as I'm mum to a little one who's lactose intolerant and we're fairly fed up of being limited to sorbet only while the other kids indulge in their deluxe sundaes! I visited with a friend to scope the place out before I brought him and I have to say I was not disappointed. The shop was pretty quiet on a Wednesday afternoon and we were served really quickly. There are minimal seats available but had we wished to stay in we'd have been able to, no problem. At \u00a33.50 for a mini pot plus 60p per topping my first impression was that it was a little pricey but actually the tub was deceptive, there was a lot more in there than I thought! I went for the cookies and cream and it was tasty but I could taste the coconut pretty clearly. Coconut cookie would've been more accurate a description. I had the brownie/tiffin pieces on top and they were really good but I only got 3 tiny squares for 60p, a little disappointing. I'll definitely return with my son as I can't wait for him to be able to have free reign of an ice cream parlour and stack up anything he wants but my own experience was slightly less fabulous than I'd hoped.",

As some one who looooooovvvveeeesss ice cream & all things made from ice cream but who also has an intolerance to both gluten & dairy, summer time can be a tough time, I was so excited to be taken to this place. The person in front of me brought a picture of a milkshake that someone else had purchased. She did not know what was in it and asked the server to make the same for her. Not once was her request looked upon as ridiculous. In stead the server just gave her best opinion of what it could be.The staff are friendly, allowing me to sample about half a dozen of the ice cream and were not offended when I chose none of the flavours I sampled. We also got the advice chose anything for the milkshake and if it wont go together then you will be informed before it is made. There are some interesting flavours and some standard flavours. There are toppings you can pay for and free topping that you can have too. Oh and the ice cream - it's amazing. So yummy, so more-ish, so good. Definitely worth you going there.",
