Well now you can reminisce in London as this restaurant, keeping it consistent, pretty much matches the same theme and atmosphere. Extremely decadent, this really is the perfect place for a special occasion. The portions are larger than expected, we ordered three starters between two of us (mushroom satay, chicken satay and lobster rolls). You know, just in case the four course meal ahead of us wasn't enough. Anyone would think we hadn't eaten for weeks before but the food is of a generous size. The food was tasty and flavoursome, atmosphere great although the tables were a little cramped together so when full it did feel as though the people next to you were perched on your lap. The cocktail bar downstairs was unusual in a good way with a sunken bar, cocktails worth every penny and lots of choice too. Good service although they did want us to hurry along and order, apart from that and the slight over crowding I can't complain!",

    "text": "I ended up in Crazy Bear purely on accident due to a combination of aligning stars, choosing the right shoes, and the inability of some friends to read the name on the menu. The d\u00e9cor is uber luxury, the wait staff very helpful and incredibly sexy, and the drinks call to you in such a way that would have even the Sirens leaping into the sea.We were supposed to meet at Dabbous (just down the road) and after waiting in front for 15 minutes I called them only to find out they were at another bar. Now, I was pretty sure I was at Dabbous (the name in large letters over the door gave it away) but they swore they were in the right place. Once we had snuck past the door guardians and seated ourselves, I took great pleasure (petty, I know, I know) in pointing out the name of the bar emblazoned across the menus. While the others fled to Dabbous in fear of being late to the party, Markus L and I decided to sample what Crazy Bear had to offer (I'm talking about the drinks here...get your mind out of the gutter).To this day, Markus and I can't remember what the name of his drink was and only recall that it had gooseberry jam as an ingredient. It was martini-shaped, a deep red hue the colour of a smoldering temptress's lips, and a tart fruity taste that teased the tongue left you wanting more. I opted for the more distinguished gentleman's drink, the Sazerac. This was a Sazerac I could drink forever with the rich smoky undertones of the whisky providing the bass foundation for the delicate citrus melody. My only complaint is that it was served neat in a room temperature glass while I prefer the extra chill of a few cubes. Still, a minor point by any standards.Overall, I could see this as a great place to take a date or anyone you are trying to impress. Drinks are pricey at around \u00a312 per cocktail but the skill and presentation definite make it worth the cash. You'll want to dress up for this bar and I'm not sure they will let you in the door unless you are at least smart casual. Suit up and get over to Crazy Bear for some quality drinkage in an area of town that boasts more than a few top places for a tipple.",

My favorites were the sesame toasted bread, pad thai, and spring rolls. Where I thought the food could be much better were the traditional Chinese dishes. The shao mai and bok choi just didn't taste authentic. We also didn't eat the Cotswolds chicken in a green curry sauce because it was too ginger-y and I guess neither of us like green thai curry sauce. It's too bad because the chicken was actually the largest dish. The dipping sauces were also fantastic.Overall it was a wonderful experience and we would consider returning for another tasting meal.",

You'll be instantly entranced by the lavish candelabras and opulent glass tables and your internal jukebox will be playing Sade's greatest hits before you know it. \u00a0The upstairs restaurant was far less inspired, other than by the overuse of multiple chili peppers. Being a spicy food fiend, I had no complaints and enjoyed the self inflicted pain bite by bite. But unless you are a certified fire breather, you'll probably want to take careful note of the Asian inspired ingredients.And the bathrooms? You guessed it ...",

The toilets were something to behold though; if you can distinguish the male and female toilets from each other (from the outside) I'm impressed. I went on a Tuesday night and the atmosphere was pretty dead. In hindsight I probably should have chosen somewhere in Soho that was a bit more lively. Maybe at the weekend it would have been busierThere were some very good drinks on the menu - the Smoked Rob Roy was my favourite and I highly recommend it if you're a peaty whisky fan - and some that were pretty average. The price was maybe slightly higher than other similar places in the area, but that's not necessarily my biggest consideration. If you're willing to pay \u00a310 for a cocktail, you're probably willing to pay \u00a312.Overall I can't complain about anything. Drinks were good, service was good, decor was ok, but I just know so many other, better, places in London that I would rather go to.

    "text": "I have to agree with Stephy on many of her views. The downstairs bar is a kaleidoscopic joy of booths, cow hide seats and beautiful decor. The cocktails served are a little expensive but carefully made to a high standard. Without question the bar is the highlight of Crazy Bear, and the harem'esque, dark vibe keeps me coming back for more.I recommend booking a booth in advance. You need to either be seating plenty of people or spending a lot of money to get one, but they are fantastically snug and well placed for intimacy. Having a booth draws you away from the suited after work crowds that dominate Crazy Bear.The restaurant I found to be a let down. The waiter I had was overtly pushy in his up-selling. It was totally unnecessary and immediately put a bad marker down for the remaining service. It seemed the waiting staff worked on auto pilot and seemed unable to provide a personal caring approach. The food was good but incredibly hot and spicy, even for one who likes spicy food. I'd recommend checking heat levels with your server before ordering. \u00a0Once you've sampled a few of the drinks, head for the bathrooms and walk straight into the final scenes of Enter the Dragon. The toilets are covered in mirrors wall to wall and it is difficult to find ones way back out. Don't worry Mr Han isn't lurking behind doors to claw you.Crazy Bear is definitely worthwhile checking out for cocktails and bar snacks, but I'd give it a miss for dinner.",

    "text": "Okay, before I begin this review, I have to say that this place should be looked at in two ways. One, as a swank little cocktail lounge and two, as a fully running restaurant.First, the bar downstairs. It is awesome. It's so over the top with its selections of decor, combining everything from white snakeskin covered, heavy as hell silver chairs and stools, to boisterous candelabras, to little romantic dens of red leather. There's mirrors all over the place and it has an element of naughty that I, well, of course I loved! I ordered a \"Thank You & Good Night\" and it was a tasty whiskey and peach cocktail that was pretty fantastic on the palate. So for the bar, a definite strong 4 stars.Now for the restaurant upstairs. Have to say, wasn't impressed. The biggest problem I had was the level of spice and heat they gave everything. I mean, this wasn't the \"Oh, that is a bit spicy, isn't it?\" meal. No, no, no, no. This was \"Holy Hot DAMNNN! What the hell did they put in this?!?! Help, call the fire department!!! I don't think my mouth is gonna make it!!!\"Yeah, that isn't good.Besides the spice and heat, the scallop starter I ordered was totally overcooked. The pork ribs were actually done perfectly. They literally fell off the bone with a simple prick of a fork and the sauce was perfect! I also ordered the white crab and shrimp fried rice and it was good, but again just too spicy and it detracted from the taste of the dish.Another bad point was the service. He was there. He was taking our orders, but there was such an obvious level of up sell going on that it kind of made us cringe. I ordered 2 starters and a fried rice and thought, wow, what a pig I am. And he looked at me like I was crazy to only order that small amount. \"You don't want a main as well?\" No, no mister server man, I don't.So, my conclusion is this, I would definitely say come for the bar downstairs and have a fun time with deliciously different cocktails and such and avoid the restaurant upstairs... unless of course, you are a strictly hot food fiend and don't care about anything else, then try the restaurant.",

    "text": "Crazy Bear is the very pinnacle of what I've seen of London's uppity foodie-holes, catering simultaneously to those who want to do something wacky (WOAH, IT'S A CRAZY BEAR) and to those who want to feel like they're part of that upper crust.It's upscale Thai food, with mood lighting and a big bar downstairs where people hunch around little seats (for the most part). I went with a party of seven, and we all took part in the tasting menu, which was a series of meals one after the other which we then had to awkwardly lean over eachother to get to. The tiny little tables made this something akin to playing Risk while your hands are greased. The food itself was good, but not great, and one particular meal (the chilli prawn, I think) made my mouth so hot that I had to consistently drink water for around an hour to get rid of the burning. There is no damn reason on this Earth that that should have been that hot, and when I practically begged the waiter to get some water because my mouth was BURNING, he slowly and ponderously refilled every glass at the table. Oh, yes, I was with a few girls, so he had to fill those too. All as I sat there saying nicely, but firmly, and loud enough to hear without being a dork \"My mouth is burning, please pour me some water.\"Overall, the real mark of a thai meal - the pad thai - was great - but the rest of the meal failed to astound or delight me on a meal I was looking forward to. Maybe it was the constant burning? Or maybe it just wasn't that good? Your choice, even though there are no other Thai restaurants that I know of in the area.Final comments:1) Crazy bear is a stupid name that has no relevance nor point to it beyond making people think it's possibly a Russian restaurant.2) Having unmarked toilets is not cool nor funky, it is annoying and rude to anyone who wants to just go to the toilet and not mess around trying to find which is the right toilet.",

The Knickerbocker glory mango dessert was Amazing so eat that if you're having dessert!",

    "text": "So once a month, my bestie and I treat ourselves to a night out and Crazy bear was our choice for September. My friend has been there several times but it was my first time and I wanted to know what all the fuss was about! I was running late as per usual and my friend had already been patiently been waiting for 10 minutes. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the super friendly hosts who showed me to our table. To say I was starving was an understatement, and of course, my first thoughts were to flick through the menu and order! It is always nice to start with a glass of prosecco after a long day! It was around 7pm, so therefore I had been up for over 12 hours- \u00a0Yes this prosecco glass was very much necessary. My friend chose to have the pornstar martini, which she highly recommends, and added that it was one of the best pornstar martinis that she had in London. I must say that the drinks came very quickly, which is a miracle in London as you are often waiting forever for your drinks! For starters, I chose the Jasmine tea smoked sticky Gloucestershire old spot pork ribs and they were gone in about 5 minutes, simply because they were so tasty. Followed by prawn tempura maki rolls and salmon sashimi- you should know by now that I absolutely adore salmon sashimi. For my main, I chose the stir-fried Aberdeen Angus beef sirloin, and I love a bit of beef, but perhaps I should have asked for the beef to be cooked medium-rare as it was very chewy and I like my steak to be more tender. However, the combinations of peppers, oyster mushrooms and oyster sauce are just mouth watering! Overall for the price of the food, it was definitely worth it, and I could not have been more stuffed. We didn't have much time but there is a cocktail bar downstairs, which seemed to be buzzing and there was a very cool DJ playing music. A few people were dancing and I too wanted to shake a leg but I had work quite early the next day, sad times. I would advise to have dinner around 7pm-8pm and then follow with drinks downstairs from 10pm onwards.  Price: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 What to wear: Smart casual(I wore a leather jacket, silk tee, skinny jean and Christian Louboutin heels) Ambience and hospitality: Staff were very attentive and witty",

    "text": "My review is based on a discounted price: Groupon - \u00a320 for \u00a340 worth of sushi. Crazy bear reminded me instantly of upscale Vegas. From the outside, the restaurant is glowing with drape curtain lights and no obvious sign. The fact that there is no sign makes it feel like an elite club and seeing the ladies and gentlemen walk in and out of there, it reinforced that feeling. As soon as you step in, it's as if you stepped on the bespoke club from the 1950s - dark, romantic lighting, velvet style seating, steel dimmed lighting secured to the table tops, old vintage wooden walls and cabinets. It's a nice setting for a date, apps with your girlfriends, or even a swanky birthday celebration. My boyfriend and I came with a Groupon voucher for \u00a340 of sushi, sashimi and/or champagne. If we didn't have the Groupon, we wouldn't have come here as the cost of sushi is significantly more expensive than what we'd be comfortable paying for. For just over \u00a340, we ordered a tuna, salmon, dynamite and dream roll - 8 pieces per roll, 32 pieces total. To our surprise, it was as delicious. However, at \u00a39-14 per roll, it's not worth it at full price - perhaps this is just a foreigners opinion as Toronto prices are much more affordable.Putting cost aside, we really enjoyed the restaurant. That is why I gave it a 4*. We were treated well, even though we had a Groupon voucher to use. Our sushi came out at a reasonable time and the rice was just right - not too much, not too little. The service was good, water was refilled and never did we feel like we were less than anyone else eating there because of the groupon and that it was a dry dinner. One thing I really appreciated was when I asked for the restroom. The waiter walked me all the way there and for good reason as the doors were hidden behind a discreet wall door. If you had walked to that corner, you would never have thought that mirror looking wall was actually a door.",

The food is, on the whole, great. The \u00a325 menu gets you a glass of champagne (the waitress was at pains to make clear that any additional glasses would be charged at \u00a320 each), a beautifully cooked steak the size of a 50p coin, and a sliver of lobster which probably rivals your thumb in both length and circumference.Fortunately the a la carte menu can help you out, where a tablespoon of \"saut\u00e9ed seasonal vegetables\" will set you back \u00a38. This is part of their ploy...The food itself was delicious. But unfortunately I left more hungry than I was before I arrived.",

The service was spot on, our hostess made sure we were ok, had enough drinks, if we needed appetiziers etc. She was quite friendly. I went for the double decker champagne cocktail, ok so my first initial reaction was that it might be a bit heavy, like a double decker chocolate. It was actually the total opposite, tasted like a black forest gateau, just a lot lighter, mozart dark chocolate balances the flavours. You have an aroma of different notes in your mouth, the last note you are left with is the cherry liqour which is not even the prominent flavor. I like the variety of champagne cocktails on their menu, there are so many combinations, rather than your bog standard.",

    "text": "The Crazy bear is a small chain scattered around the UK offering a menu that focuses on a range of Oriental dishes varying from Japanese, Chinese and to Thai although they also offer an afternoon menu. It's well known for their beautiful stylish decor. The Fitzrovia branch definitely contains that classy decor with its leather seats and wall panel, taxidermies at the front and elegant metal lampshade at each table. Downstairs had the more neon dark haunt surroundings and the fully glass mirrored toilets was definitely worth visiting even if you don't need to go. However compared to all the up and coming restaurants in London, it's decor is nothing spectacular and won't be winning any rewards.My best friend treated me a 12 course tasting menu described as premium although premium was a bit of an exaggeration especially for putting prawn crackers and rice as individual courses. Crispy seaweed Didn't expect crispy seaweed to be on a premium tasting menu. It was nice that it was actual seaweed and not fried cabbage but it didn't do much for texture being quite hard which turned chewy after a while.The edamame beans These were more satisfying. A nice kick of heat and saltiness from the Japanese spice and rock salt that gave its addictive flavour Shrimp crackersAnother dish I didn't quite understand why it was part of the tasting menu as it has always been a complimentary dish. Still it was much welcomed as a snack before the mains came being well fried, crispy and light with nice seafood aromas.Modern style sea bass sashimi Probably the highlight dish of the meal. The quality of the sea bass was at its best, silky and almost sweet in taste. The marinade was perfect, ponzu giving it slight zesty savoury edge, fresh chilli for a nice kick and smoothed out by the creaminess of the mayonnaise.Wagyu beef tartare in mini taco shells These were also incredible. The advantage of having wagyu over any regular beef really stood out. The meat was incredibly tender and soft with beautiful sweetness coming out from the meat, balanced nicely with the sourness from the ponzu and kick from the wasabi. The taco shell gave it an interesting textural contrast to the filling and topping of mayonnaise for a creamy finishRoasted mandarin cherry valley duck.Honey roasted loin of Gloucester old spot porkCrispy belly of Gloucester old spot porkAll the classic Chinese roast meats on one plate. Even though I've had this hundreds of times over it was still very refreshing to have it produced using high quality meat. The breast of duck was incredibly tender, full of flavour and moist. Crispy pork belly had a good ratio of meat to fat, bouncy and juicy which made a good contrast against the lovely crispy skin. The roasted loin was a lovely balance of sweet and savoury, succulent and also incredibly soft and tender even without the help of fat to marbleise it. They were all finish off by having a oyster soy sauce slurry poured over them which really helped the meats cling on to more moisture and flavour. Great to have with the accompanied rice.Lobster pad Thai noodles.Probably the most disappointing dish out of the meal. It wasn't bad and very edible but just lacked flavour, The lobster did not taste fresh, tempura'ed instead of steamed or grilled which meant the flavour was masked behind some greasy batter. There wasn't much meat, mostly cartilage and wasn't seasoned so was very bland. Pad Thai was very sweet and didn't deliver much on depth although it was cooked well and al dente. I expected more from a \u00a362.50 tasting menuChargrilled eggplantThe texture was lovely, soft and gooey and in a nice balanced oyster soy slurry to keep it slimy and wet. Nice garlicky notes with a good kick to it from the fresh chillies to make things more exciting.Champagne rhubarb and Madagascan vanilla cheesecake A very nice finish to our meal. The champagne rhubarb came as a topping of jelly which was a very welcomed contrast to the creamy cheese filling. I very much enjoyed the thick smooth cheese embedded with rich vanilla notes. The biscuit base was thin, buttery and moist which did not distract it from the softness of the dish but only accentuated its creaminess.To me, the Crazy Bear is a bit outdated. Maybe 10 years ago this menu would have served its purpose in giving everyone a good tasting menu of some of the classic East Asian flavours. But today people are after something more than good but creative and breaking away from the classic dishes that are more for the Western palate but something more authentic and traditional to what you find in Asia. You would not find crispy seaweed anywhere in Asia. For a tasting menu listed as premium costing \u00a362.50 each I did expect to be more 'wowed' but was not. It was just food cooked well. For the cost for two people I could have gone to a top end Chinese or Thai restaurant and ordered a whole duck, lobster on noodles plus starters and sides to feed four or more.",

They are definitely playing up the slick, wet mirror-look which I found ritzy to the point of garish. Also the toilets are needlessly confusing. The last thing you want to be doing when you have to pee is wandering around and asking people how to find it as the toilets are unmarked.We had this 'Surf and Turf' deal where you share a Chateaubriand and get a lobster each between two of you plus a glass of champagne for like 35 quid each. As soon as we were seated, the waiter explained to us several times about how since we had a deal, both the lobsters and the steak had to be cooked exactly the same way. I found it quite condescending that he kept loudly repeating it. Also, it made sense for the steak (as it was to be shared between 2) but not the lobster. Plus, there must have been a mistake, because a group of 4 of us went and we ended up having a lobster each but sharing 1 (ONE) Chateaubriand which was just not enough food at all, given the very small size of the lobsters. Also, the Chateaubriand was murdered - tasteless and sauce-less. To boot, absolutely nothing accompanied either dish. I would have taken the whole dish back if we were paying full price. In fact, I would hate to pay full price for anything here given the size of their portions.The worst possible feeling is walking out of a reputable restaurant feeling starving and walking straight into a McDonalds. I hear the cocktail bar is good, though? Obviously we were not jazzed enough to stay for one...",

    "text": "It's true that Crazy Bear is crazy expensive, although when you crazily order 4 cocktails even though you can see the crazy prices, you can't get so angry at the Bear.The cocktails were good although not massively memorable. I really liked my Espresso Martini (my favourite cocktail) which we had after dinner in the downstairs bar which is fun and glitzy like everyone says although I personally would not describe it as beautiful (unlike the lights on the outside of the building which I LOVE). The highlight of the whole meal was the cod which is my friend's favourite and is a buttery delicious concoction which is moreish but at the same time incredibly rich so it gets a bit overwhelming if you keep going back for more (which I did). I also really liked the squid stuffed with pork (fish AND meat - yeah) and the monkfish was excellent too. Monkfish is probably my favourite fish and its sweet flavour was perfect with the curry sauce. We had a few starters too which weren't so memorable, I would skip dim sum here as you can get better quality and quantity in Chinatown (or in the other secret places for dim sum in London that I am sure must exist. Srsly, tell me where they are).So I wouldn't rave about the starters we had but there are probably other better options: the menu is huge. Literally, it's huge, I could barely hold it up. Also, they need to print more cocktail menus because they kept taking ours away which was foolish because I probably would have spent even more money if I'd been allowed to keep perusing it.Service was a little slow at times but the staff were really sweet and gave some helpful recommendations.Let's talk about the downstairs toilets. I literally, literally, walked into a wall. Right into it. I smashed my face into it. I had no idea what was going on. And this was after I was really really close to walking into the men's by mistake (and I DO NOT like the sight of urinals) and before I then spent about five minutes waving my hands under things that could possibly be taps like a crazy person. Oh wait, I see what you've done there, Crazy Bear.",

My friends had salt and pepper prawns which were gorgeous but my meal overall wasn't up to the standard you would expect with the prices charged.",

    "text": "This is great. To start - the venue has no name outside. Just the bamboo bush tells you that you arrived in the right spot. Once inside, you don't have the impression that you are in a Thai restaurant - no carvings, no drapes, nothing traditional. Best to characterise it as a club. Enter the bar downstairs and enjoy the wide range of cocktails and after this you will be guided to the table. Everything on the menu is worthwhile trying. Keep a bit of space for pudding as I discovered when taking the (not available vanilla) cheesecake - I had a mojito cheesecake in lieu which was really delicious and well presented. A place to remember.",

    "text": "This location is one of the properties of Crazy Bear Group which owns some really funky looking hotels, bars and restaurants. The venue is in the heart of Fitzrovia and has both restaurant and a cocktail bar. My friend and I only went to the restaurant part. The dining room is long and narrow with all couch seating along the 3 sides of the room. This place is not very suitable for large groups, because most of the table is big enough for two people to sit side by side, which is a really odd set up. The whole time I was eating, I had to turn my body 45 degree angle so I could see and talk to my friend. The dining room is dimly lit by the tiny table lamps on each of the table. Now that I think about it, it is more like a jazz club than a restaurant. We ordered the premium classic tasting menu at a hefty price of 59 pound per person. Before we even sat down, the waiter informed us that we have to eat fast, because we only have the table for an hour and half! I couldn't believe that we were paying good money and still being rushed! Well, as soon as the food started coming, I actually didn't mind leaving ASAP. I'd say the genre of food is a mix of Chinese and Thai. And in this premium tasting menu, shrimp cracker, edamame and even steamed rice are considered dishes! The crispy duck salad was filled with coarsely chopped, almost finger length spring onions. The only thing that was mildly ok was a chicken curry. I guarantee you that you can find much tastier food in Chinatown for 1/3 of the price. I was really amazed that in a city with so many great restaurants, Crazy Bear could thrive, considering we were being kicked out after an hour and half to make ways for the next group of diners! However, I know another place that I will not be coming back to.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch and while the food was good, especially the sushi and dim sum, for the price there's a lot better to be had in London. The service wasn't great as we had to continually ask for our water to be topped up and it seemed to take ages for empty tables to be cleared.  All in all it was a good one off experience but not really to be repeated unless you enjoy spending extra money for a quirky dining environment",

    "text": "Amazing food and amazing cocktails. Beautiful venue just was let down by the awful service. We want as party of 6 and although we were on time for our booking at 7pm in the lounge bar downstairs \u00a0we did not get served for 25mins due to the fact they had just one waitress doing the rounds.After two drinks we was told our table was ready upstairs for dinner however when we got there another waiter said he couldn't find our booking even though this was now an hour and a half later since we checked in. He was then overruled after five minutes of divving about by a manager.Following this the service was slow or rude and it took three attempts of asking for someone to take our initial food order.Despite all this the food could not be faulted from course to course everything was perfect. Particularly liked the chicken Satay which was part of the starter and the best Chinese belly of pork in my main.Would go again maybe just not for a while til the sort the service.",
