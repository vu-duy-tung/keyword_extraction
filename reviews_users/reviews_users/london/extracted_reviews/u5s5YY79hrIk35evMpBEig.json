The food is absolutely delicious for a decent price and once again, the whole sharing small plates and trying everything is brilliant. The only thing I could complain about is that the staff has been, all three times I've been there, quite short in tone and not very friendly. Maybe they were just having some bad days, maybe they don't like the way my face looks. I don't know. Either way, I would still come back because the food alone is worth it.",

Saying that I found the staff to be really nice and helpful and I do like the actual restaurant. Nice feel and looks clean.",

    "text": "I didn't know whether to be excited or trepidatious when somewhere I love, especially somewhere so small, quirky and seemingly unchainable opens another branch. The original Yalla Yalla only opened a year or so ago on a tiny anonymous (and slightly pissy if we're honest) alley just off Brewer Street. It became a favourite for lunch, if slightly far away and always too crowded to sit down. They some very clever things with a bit of lamb, a few sesame seeds and some very good flatbread. Homely, authentic and very down to earth, it certainly didn't have Global Resto Megachain written all over it.The closure of our local greasy spoon wasn't a cause for much mourning, cheap and a little scuzzy, it was never more than a last resort lunch spot. The surprise came with the news that Yalla Yalla was going up in the world, and expanding. It's certainly got more space than the original. They've still got the same menu of authentic Beirut street food, though have expanded this to include a few larger dishes. On both occasions (twice in two days, but working lunches doesn't count as proper calories) we went for sets of mezze to share. Tart pickled turnip (a proper revelation), olives and peppers came as we sat, the food freshly cooked and shortly afterwards. Hommos (sic) came with moreish juicy lumps of lamb, melting with crisp burnished edges from the hefty elephantine leg of meat rotating round the grill. This is how sheep hope their babies end up and as far from your local 'bab house as you can get. The same lamb features with a lemon parsley salad as a main course and packing their (perfect for takeaway) rolls. Grilled pitta stuffed with spicy minced lamb came topped with tahini and pomegranate, a princely portion for \u00a34.25. The other entrant in the 'can't believe they can do that good for that cheap' category was a huge portion of deep fried prawns, whitebait and calamari, well cooked, well spiced and well cheap (sorry, really) for \u00a35.50. There's not much I wouldn't go back for to be honest. And it's round the corner from my office, so I will, soon. \u00a0The slightly claustrophobic feel of the Green Court original has gone, banished by wide spaces, though thankfully many of the more pleasing, rustic touches remain. Bench seating, dotted in places with throws and cushions, goes well with the thickset oak furniture. The staff are keen, possibly too keen, but you can't fault them for that. Genuinely eager to please, four of them checking on how the meal was going may have been a little OTT, no matter how much they meant it. It's a genuinely promising place for lunch, perfect for shoppers and Soho workers unable or unwilling to get to Charlotte Street.",

The falafel was some of the best I ever had and the hummus and baba ganoush are also pretty great. The food doesn't all come out at once, which I didn't mind apart from that our fried fish dish was brought out about 5-10 minutes after everything else.The service was ok. It was very busy so I can forgive it not being 5*. One issue was where our table was placed though (in a corner behind stairs) which meant often having to wave erratically to get any attention.That being sad, I am a fan of this place! Personally prefer the atmosphere of the smaller Soho branch.",

Reasonably priced, a lunch for two with six variations and no alcohol will only set you back \u00a330 (ish).I can highly, highly recommend the Soujoc, which are homemade spicy lebanese sausages with tomato, parsley and lemon juice. They were amazing. The grilled halloumi, falafel and hummous with bread rounded it off nicely. We also had the batata harra, spicy saut\u00e9ed potato with red pepper, corriander, garlic, cumin and fresh chili - which was a perfect combo.The takeout wraps are apparently also delicious, but I'm yet to try.

    "text": "I cunningly geared a group of friends towards the new Yalla Yalla, as it is conveniently positioned a stone's throw away from my office. The four of us are big middle eastern food eaters so know our babbas from our hummuses. The restaurant is far large than its Soho sister, making it less claustrophobic, although I found the high stools and long benches rather out of keeping with the lebanese norm - when you think middle eastern, youu think comfy poofs and low tables. The effect seemed slightly sterile - very much a Londoner's lebanese - although you can't argue with the fact that the restaurant looked bright, brand new and clean. Hummus and Babba Ganoush were pretty standard but tasty and fresh nonetheless. A dish of crushed nuts with peppers and olive oil was more unsual (so much so that I can't remember the name) and therefore a welcome addition. The Makale Samak - a HUGE portion of deep-fried seafood - was a bit full-on for my tastes, and needed a good dose of lemon juice. It took us a good 15 minutes to get someone's attention for the lemons, by which time the seafood was cold - the one blight to the evening. Shish Taouk (grilled chicken with vermicelli rice) was good but could have done with a bit more Taouk, and the Fatte Khodra (another unfamiliar dish of cooked veg in yoghurt and tomato sauce topped with pitta) was slightly over-cardamom'd but generally liked by all. The perfect place to go with a group of friends - it was rather noisy but that only added to the atmosphere, and we were happy to dig in to the pitta and shout along with the rest of 'em.",

They set us down at two long tables, which had enough space around them so we could get up and walk around. \u00a0That is most important if you want to chat with another person further down the table without shouting the house down.We had a set Christmas menu, which consisted of a selection of starters and dips, like hummus, spicy sausages and little chicken things that looked like spring rolls. I have to admit that it was so \"lecker\" that I stuffed myself with these starters without considering the main course. Main was lamp cooked on the bone with sweet couscous. It was a dish not everyone liked, but the meat was well done and the whole dish fit together well. To finish we had baklava and rice pudding. Also delicious!During the whole stay the waiters were very patient with us and also a bit flirty, which always goes down well with a group of girls.

And the food was exactly that, the Middle Eastern version of Wagamama et al. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. It all tasted like typical Middle Eastern fare and didn't convince me that I had to make a return journey here.Service was prompt, friendly, and efficient, and very helpful with a friend's dietary restrictions. Food arrived quickly, although in somewhat scattered fashion. First up were babaganoush, labne bilthum (a yogurt dish with garlic), and halloumi. Portions were small and there wasn't much flavour to any of the dishes. The babaganoush could have been hummous, the labne tasted like greek yogurt with some spices, and the halloumi was very bland. Arrayes came next, which were pastry filled with semi-sweet spiced lamb, followed by the sea bass, which was probably the best dish we had. Very nicely spiced with a great sauce, the fish was well cooked and really tasty. Lamb and chicken shawarmas followed, both overflowing with meat. Neither was orchestrated very well and we just felt like we were eating well cooked, sliced meat, on top of a very thin pita. Finally, the sojouc appetizer was brought out, which were Lebanese sausages, perfectly ok, but nothing spectacular.Which basically sums up this whole restaurant...everything, including the Lebanese lager, was just ok. Not great, not up to Maroush and honestly not even on par with Tas. And in the end, it was fairly expensive too, with just 4 beers, the meal for 4 came to \u00a380.",

Normally I like communal dining, but the stools were uncomfortable & luck of the draw will have you being too close to your overbearingly loud, self-absorbed neighbour stranger. Service was quick but hectic. Requested twice to have the salad that comes with the lahem meshoue swapped for fattoush & could tell it wasn't going to happen by the waiter's non-reaction. As it goes, we were served by 3 different people. A couple nearby asked if they could get more pita & the waitress hurriedly replied \"I'm not really sure\". When attempting to get the bill, the waiter kept passing by & didn't return after saying he would. Another wait & request for the bill to another server. Finally we stood to put on our coats & the bill arrived.Better experience & atmosphere at the smaller, seedier Green's Court location.",

One wants the the restaurant to be not too expensive , another wants to meet in central london and the third is vegan and they all need to be impressed.DO YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE TO WORK WITH!?Anyway, so having consulted the internet for such a place professor internet recommended this place. It says that the food is fresh and cheap. It's tasty and great for vegetarians and most of all it's central and boy is the internet a wonderful mistress, she always (well mostly) comes up trumps!You can't book, you have to enter in a Wagamama style queue and get sat on a long table, though individual tables were also around. The staff were enthusiastic and were helpful with the menu.We just had a couple of starters and wine each, which was more than enough. The vege stuff was done to perfection with nut pate and various hummous but the best for me was the steak tartar, all beautiful and just enough. It's rare that a restaurant gets the vege stuff to be just as good as the meat and gives the option of not feeling too bloated on leaving.The place got all my points! yay points!PS Reservations are only for groups of 10 or more",

If I'm in the eighbourhodo and craving lebanese food and don't mind something loud, then maybe. Otherwise I don't see myself bothering. Staff are lovely, and the food is quite decent, but the place is so incredibly loud that I'd avoid it on those grounds only.

My position on it is that it will still scratch your itch for shawarma or hummus if you are nearby and need to eat Lebanese food, but try a more authentic option if available. I first went there (at the Green's Court location) in 2011, and I feel as if it may have gone a bit downhill since then. The mezze options are decent, and I have no real complaints about the hummus or falafel. I prefer a bit more garlic in my hummus, but it's okay. The shish taouk is flavorful, and is my recommended main course here; the only thing I would change is that I often find it to be slightly dry. The chicken shawarma, which I've ordered perhaps half a dozen times, is frustratingly bland compared to options available at other Lebanese restaurants, where this dish bursts with lemon, olive oil, garlic, and spices. If you do go for the shawarma, make sure to request their garlic sauce to augment the seasonings.",

    "text": "My crew and I were thrilled to check out this casual and affordable walk in restaurant by Oxford Circus. It was bustling the last time we'd walked past and the concept of street food always appeals to me (they market themselves as Lebanese street food). Long benches offer seating good for groups and keeps with the casual vibe of the place. Despite the service being amazing (our Parisian waitress was so friendly and accommodating) and the food being worthy of 3 stars, this place is getting 2 stars and won't be receiving a repeat visit by me.This spot was infested with fruit flies. Mind you its the middle of the winter. So this is some real cause for concern regarding the cleanliness of this place. Plus it takes away from the dining experience when you're constantly having to flick flies away from your food while simultaneously trying to eat it. Try as hard as we might, those flies were incessant and kept hovering. My arms definitely got a workout from the constant swatting.Ok I'll stop about the disgusting flies now. If you do go, the best thing about the food was the red pepper sauce. It's amazing. Ask for a whole bunch of it and then pour it on top of everything - so yummy!I had the chicken shawarma upon strong recommendation from the wonderful waitress. She warned in advance that it would be a large portion, enough for doggy bags. And she was right. Plenty of chicken, rice and salad. Served with heaping sides of garlic mayo and red pepper hot sauce. Average shawarma, nothing to write home about. Be warned that the food does not reheat well! The chicken was actually borderline rank once microwaved the next day.",

    "text": "So I'd heard a lot of hype about this place and so post the Yelp newbie night, me and a few friends decided to check it out. Hmmm so I really wanted to love it, but it was just average.What was good then? Gotta say the food was delicious, the chicken was flavoursome and nice and tender. The chilli sauce made the rice, the right amount of spicy and the portion size was enormous. Definitely worth \u00a311.50! So far so good.. So what was bad? Well the seating wasn't great, we were given a table by the door and then reluctantly allowed to move to a warmer one. We were told they didn't want to use another table, as they didn't want to start using another table, fairly close to closing. Kinda disappointing, but ok I can understand that and after a gentle persuasion we got to move.There was so many flies in the restaurant, and this is a real bug bearer of mine and have to admit put me off a bit. It definitely made me a bit conscious of the hygiene. I did also feel towards the end of the meal, that they wanted us to leave, but I guess it was near closing and they wanted to finish up, which I can understand. On a final note, I have to say though, credit to our server, she was friendly and helpful with recommendations and sorted out doggie bags for my friends, whom wanted to take some home. Overall, it was just an average place to eat and I'm not really gonna rush to go back.",

Saw the ratings weren't too good, but at this point, a dry place was more a priority to me than excellent food. I ordered the Loubieh (the special of the day, 10.95 pound) which was slow cooked lamb shoulder with runner beans in a rich tomato sauce served with basmati rice. Truly nothing special, rather I just considered it food on a plate to fill me up. Usually when I order lamb dishes, the lamb is cooked in such a way that its flavours and seasonings really pop. However, this dish's flavours all kind of blended together and there wasn't much distinctiveness to it. Service, although friendly and apologetic (even though it wasn't busy... there were only 2 other tables being waited on), was very slow. Order was slow to be taken, food was slow to arrive, water was slow to be refilled, bill was slow to be received... the trend continues. Also overheard another gentleman getting told he couldn't sit down until the other two of his remaining party arrived (which I thought was odd since it was so empty in the restaurant). Definitely a sub-par establishment that looks awesome inside with its decor, furnishing, marketing materials, and lighting, but as they say, looks can be deceiving!",

    "text": "I used to really like this place and Yalla Yalla was my go-to for Middle Eastern food. Especially the Soho location, which is a hole-in-the-wall, tiny kind of place felt like a discovery.This location however? Not so much. Both the food, but most importantly the service, was very disappointing, so I will for sure not be returning, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody.We ordered a pretty big meal with hummous, some kind of chicken pastry and tabbouleh to start. The hummous was the worst I've had in years - totally bland with some sort of nasty aftertaste. Ugh. The pita bread tasted really stale. Old. Like it has been in a Tesco Value pack for a few years. The taboulleh was short on the lemon. The chicken pastry was very nice however, but one good dish out of three is a very poor score for any meal.We went for a Lebanese wine, and a variety of main courses. All of this was disappointing - it felt like another restaurant compared to what I had visited in the past. He chicken shawarma plate was DRY. Like scraps of leather. He driest chicken shawarma that has crossed my palate. It was almost un-eatable. Shawarma is supposed to be juicy. This was drier that many shoe soles, and totally lacked any flavour. Like chewing on chicken skin but without the flavour of actual chicken. We got two little plates of sauce for the whole table - not enough!The worst however was the wine - and the service around it. When the waitress poured it, a big, frankly huge piece of cork dropped into the glass. At least I think it was cork, it could have been something less tasteful. I showed it to her and she looked confused. As in \"what do you want me to do about it?\" confused. I guess that's ok if you're flippin burgers at McDonald's, but not great when you're the sommelier! The manager came back and at first angrily refused to give us a fresh bottle. He explained they had removed the cork bla bla bla... I asked for a new bottle and he angrily obliged (although initially refusing). Word of advice: if you're the manager, being angry at your customers when your staff screws up is not a way to run a restaurant! Basically, the whole dinner and ambiance was ruined.And to top it off, the wine was actually pretty horrible. And I love Lebanese wine normally. This one was just sour and off in some way. Stay away - it was very vinegary.So to whoever owns this chain: Get some better staff and take it back to the standards it had a few years ago. Right now, people will get a better experience at the McDonald's around the corner. So me and my friends will not be returning. It was a one-star restaurant experience through and through.",

I was greeted by a smile and promptly seated. Drinks and some nibbles arrived in short order. Great advice on menu teams from the waiter ensures I had an amazing dining experience. The staff left you in peace to enjoy your meal rather than pester you every few minutes to ask if everything is fine. I would recommend this place to anyone that appreciates Lebanese food or willing to try delicious food with great flavor.",

    "text": "Really lovely food, but I genuinely felt like they hated me for eating it!It was a busy Friday night, so I get that they didn't necessarily have the time to spend explaining the menu in depth to us. Maybe they picked up on the fact that we only had 30 mins to squeeze some food in, so they thought we'd want them to be dismissive and curt with their service, giving only brief answers about what I was going to spend my money on, so as to save valuable minutes. They were knowledgeable about the food, and we did get some help choosing, but the waitress was so cold and unfriendly, no \"ooooh that one's my favourite\" gushings, just all business. It really put me off.The food came out quickly, as advertised. The mixed grill was full of juicy, well seasoned meat, my favourite being the chicken. The calamari was a huge portion of batter with the occasional whiff of the sea permeating from it. I'm told the aubergine was nice, (although I don't understand the appeal of aubergine, but that's neither here nor there).We managed to scoff half of the meal before asking it to be boxed up to take away; we were going to be late after all.Overall a disappointment, not sure it's one I'll be in a hurry to repeat.",

    "text": "Definitely my go to spot in London! \u00a0I've eaten here on countless occasions but always get the seabass it's just that good!YUM! To start I have the baba ghannouj and the samboussek jibne . I am not very familiar with Lebanese but the menu is easy enough to figure out with the descriptions.The Yalla jou jou dessert is excellent as well. Vanilla mousse speculoos with dark chocolate and dark chocolate sauce.The prices are reasonable for the quality of food.The drinks are delicious and freshly made. Theres a hooka section but I don't smoke so i can't comment on that. It does get busy here and they don't take reservations so I recommend coming here early. It's not really a place to bring younger kids. The service can be so-so but they do get busy so thats understandable.",

    "text": "We arrived at about 5:45pm and it was fairly quiet so we got a nice comfy table with cushions tucked away in the corner in which to peruse the menu. Given that there was so much choice we decided to share a few mezze dishes with the option to order more if we felt we needed it.We had the hommos; thick, creamy and utterly delicious I can't stop thinking about it, falafel; which were some of the best I've ever had and totally moreish and the halloum meshoue; grilled Halloumi cheese with tomato, black olives, fresh mint and olive oil because who doesn't love squeaky cheese? There was also a small pot of complimentary olives and pickles on each table which I thought was a nice touch.By this point the restaurant had completely filled up and there was a nice happy buzz to the place as friends caught up on each others lives and shared the delicious food. Mezze (and indeed tapas) works really well for this as we found out and the portions were pretty decent for the prices. Especially as everything was fresh and delicious to the point where we were almost licking the plates clean!We'd planned on also sharing the chicken shawarma but found that we were actually quite full. This was good news though as it meant we could have pudding instead and both opted for the yalla jou jou; vanilla mousse speculoos covered in velvety dark chocolate and dark chocolate sauce with a very vanilla ice cream.It was nice but the mousse was frozen which I wasn't expecting and wasn't too keen on. I thought it would be a light and fluffy end to the meal when instead it was quite heavy and in the end I didn't finish it. Given that the entire bill came to just over \u00a330 between us I thought Yalla Yalla was very good value for money and I'd definitely return. Perhaps with a bigger group of people so that I could try even more of their delicious offerings!",

    "text": "So I will break my review up into two: food and service. 1) Food and drinks - drinks were fine - I had a Sauvignon blanc and my hubby had the mulled wine which was out of this world, warm and inviting to drink. \u00a0We were provided with complimentary pickles olives and pita. We ordered the batata hara and the baba ghanoush, both which were tasty. The batata were delicious with a hint of spice and the baba ghanoush you could really taste the roasted flavor of the eggplant which I loved. \u00a0We shared a mixed grill. I liked the chicken and the lamb mince kebab but the lamb kebab I wasn't a huge fan of. \u00a0Vermiccili rice was delicious. \u00a0If it hadn't been for the service I think I would have rated this place 4 stars2) Service - started out on a high note since we got seated even though we didn't book a reservation. Got seated and we ordered a couple drinks along with water. For some reason the server kept forgetting our waters! Even though this is not an expensive restaurant I would hope that they would still look after us and it seemed they were more interested in the party next to us. \u00a0We had been asked if we wanted hot sauce and they forgot that too until we asked a couple times. \u00a0 Maybe this is because it was a Friday night so I shouldn't complain too much. All in all me and my hubby had a good time and spent \u00a350 for the meal...not bad at all. I will go back but maybe when it's less crazy busy. Still thinking about those batata hara pieces!!",

    "text": "Found this gem on yelp... came here at lunchtime and the line was out the door!!! I decided to order for take away and they have decent priced lunch meal deals. They have an array of wraps on display to choose from. I had the hummus with Shawarma and the Soujac wrap. Soujac is a type of yummy spicy lebanese sausage. I took away a star because my wrap was a a bit soggy in places and crispy on the outside. The sogginess was most likely caused from them preparing the wrap to early in the day and letting the vegetables, pickles etc make the wrap soggy. Then they placed the wrap a few hours later on the griddle and it just didn't work. none wants gooey areas in their wrap. The hummus was not the best I have ever had but it was decent. Over all I had a good experience and would give this place another go, I left feeling beyond full.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to finally go to Yalla Yalla - I absolutely love Mediterranean food. Unfortunately Yalla Yalla was a dissappointment. The food wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was average. It lacked flavour, juiciness and depth of that Lebanese cuisine is so known for.We ordered chicken livers, skewered lamb, deep fried seafood starter, fattoush salad and Ossmalaiah for dessert.Chicken livers (Sawda Djej) were good - juicy and flavourful, I love liver as it is. Though it wasn't mind blowing, it was the best food that was served.Deep friend seafood (Makale Samak) with yoghurt dip - was average: deep fried white bait, calamari and shrimp was ok for nibbling but not very interesting.Skewered lamb (Lahem Meshue) seemed not to have any marinate at all, was plain and not exciting, it was dry too - I would definitely say overcooked. Fattoush salad had too much vinegar but was ok.And finally Osmallaiah (deep fried vermicelli with clotted cream and rose syrup) was ok too, I would definitely add more clotted cream and remove some of the vermicelli.Service was good. I liked the setting too - wooden tables (though tables we sat at were way too close to one another!), bright space, casual and unassuming. Shame about the food...",
