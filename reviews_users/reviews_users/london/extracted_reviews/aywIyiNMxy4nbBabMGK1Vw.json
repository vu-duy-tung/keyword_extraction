    "text": "OK, I will admit that the service is quality. And if you get a wine there and a food board, they are quite quality as well. and the bar itself has a rustic feel to it.But seriously!! the prices???? For the cost of a glass of wine (which are SUPER small btw) I could buy a whole bottle from the middle shelf at sainsburys. THE MIDDLE SHELF PEOPLE! that's the good stuff.The place is tiny, and it was unnecessarily crowded, and even though it was freezing in there, they obviously had been told to leave the doors open to increase the flow of business.Raul and I did a groupon wine tasting thingy here, and the even itself was really nice. It took place in the cellar below, and they served loads of really nice cheeses and meats to match the 8 glasses of wine they served. I would be HAPPY to recommend THAT to someone, but chances are the groupon offer isn't going to come around again, and you probably missed it, which means your only reading this review b/c you are looking at the place to go as a bar. and I would advise you not to. IF you want some wine and you are in Borough, go to Vinopolis! it's right around the corner! and it's not a total rip off!",

I was part of a group led down to the converted cellar one night for an evening of wine tasting and appreciation by Wine Master Of The World (this may or may not be his correct title) Arnaud. We were taken carefully and amusingly by the hand through some pretty exciting and unusual wine, entertained by Arnaud's anecdotes of stories both with (\"What's the most expensive bottle of wine you've sent back?\" \"\u00a3600\") and without wine (\"What do you order in a restaurant?\" \"Beer\"). Holed up in the cellar I was amazed at how quickly the time passed - I learned a lot (a lot more than I still remember now - should have taken more notes) and massively enjoyed myself. I'll be bringing people back here time and time again.",

No serviettes with the oily olives didn't help my cause. I will try one of their wine tastings as admittedly the wine selection did look quite impressive.",

I usually grab a random bottle, or re-visit the same wines over and again, but at Bedales I learned a lot about why I make my choices and why to not base my choices on grape variety alone. In the future, if I am wanting to try a new wine or too, or take an out-of-town guest out for a nice bottle, this is exactly where I will return.

Our host, Arnaud, was great: knowledgable, funny, and good at showing people that their own opinions and tastes can't be wrong. The majority of their wines are organic and biodynamic. Whether you believe in the efficacy of the latter system or not, they've got some tasty bottles on hand.",

The ground floor has plenty of seating for those looking to enjoy a tipple from the very large selection of wines they have on offer round the walls of the room. The back has some seating which flows out into Borough market itself, and downstairs is an excellent cellar bar. The whole place has a great atmosphere to it, with lots of interesting characters enjoying their purchases. Staff are very friendly, although somewhat distracted when it get busy. The corkage fee of \u00a38 on each bottle I believe which is a bit over the top in my view. Especially when you consider the dictionary definition of corkage: a fee charged, as in a restaurant, for serving wine or liquor brought in by the patron. Well - didn't we just buy the wine there rather than bring it with us?",

On a Qype tasting we also got to sample Bedale's charcuterie and cheese boards which were truly brilliant - especially the comte and pickled garlic.

A proper wine shop that knows it stuff, where you can sit down and try things by the glass and if you've tasted something that's really tickled you pink, buy a bottle to take home with you to enjoy later. It's a wine bar too see, and food to compliment your glass they also have. Cheeses, meats, olives- everything to work those taste buds into a frenzy and all things that are satisfyingly salty making the wine all the more delicious. The Borough Market branch of this three store strong business is the first. Bedales head drinker and managing director Arnaud Compas started selling organic wines in 2001 in the market. Slowly one thing led to another, bonds were made, money was found and Bedales was born. Their philosophy is pure and simple. Drink the wine you enjoy and enjoy the wine you drink. This is not about knowing the chemistry behind it all, it's about the result: the drinking. Know the flavours, excite your taste buds and enthusiasm and the knowledge will come later. With things you won't be able to find elsewhere and things you would never have tasted before (I urge you to try the Fugnano Vernaccia di San Gimignano, but hold onto your seats, you're in for a surprise) Bedales is surely in a realm all of its own. All hail to the gods of wine.",

We are so disappointed about this as I'd always looked forward to settling in for a few hours here on my trips back home from New York.Synopsis: as usual, during our meander through Borough Market, we agreed to meet at Bedales for a glass (or several) of prosecco and a quick snack. We have always sat outside as we have young children and try to minimize disturbance, while enjoying an adult beverage at a nice establishment. This time, however, we were treated like utter garbage - quite the opposite to the stellar customer experience we've encountered in the past. We ordered a glass of prosecco each to enjoy on the premises, but instead of being given a glass flute we were given one of the portable plastic flutes - which apparently means that one is not allowed to sit anywhere near the premises, lest you are berated and belittled by a large, bearded bully, which is apparently who they like to hire these days. We were gobsmacked to say the least. Other customers there were embarrassed for us, and were very supportive - they couldn't believe what they were witnessing. As a side note - the lady pouring the drinks outside was lovely, although clearly needs to understand the meaning of what material the flutes are made from and advise customers accordingly.To summarise: go elsewhere if you want to be treated with respect.",

The service was just a little short of warm. What I really hope for in these sorts of place is some time talking about the various wines, a snippet of information about one or two of them and perhaps some banter. What I actually got were the words 'this one' in response to my question on which wine I should choose. So, do try it - but don't go in with very high expectations.",

    "text": "I ordered two of the most expensive house wines in their category (one was white and the other, red), and they both tasted bad, bad, bad.Perhaps the wines had gone off because it was the Christmas season and no one was coming in to the shop to order the most expensive wines by the glasses. \u00a0But that is by no means any excuse for Bedales to serve turned wine. \u00a0Turned EXPENSIVE wine.Because, I tell you what, \u00a37.50 for a 175mL glass of wine isn't cheap.Blech.Plus, the glasses were soooo small. \u00a0Surely Bedales should be serving up its wine in nice, large wine glasses, so that patrons can better enjoy its bouquet, no? \u00a0Yes? \u00a0Am I being a snob? \u00a0I would expect this sort of inattention to detail from a Wetherspoons, but not from a rather pretentious wine bar, personally.",

I was worried that on a Saturday evening it would be crowded and thus unpleasant (I don't like elbowing in to bars to order...), yet it wasn't when I visited, so I had the pleasure of being able to look around myself and chat comfortably. The wine list was interesting and the bar staff extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The gewurztraminer I sampled off the by the glass wine list was as crisp and refreshing as a Granny Smith apple. I can't wait to get back there and sample more... or do a wine tasting. Then I'll eat something, too. And once I've done that, I will probably be able to add another star to my rating.",

Bedales is a great place for the wine lovers.Sadly the waitress here was slightly under the weather aswell and didn't really have any alternatives apart from apple juice for my preggers mate! I liked the atmosphere of the place however...i think the dodgy 80's soundtrack had something to do with it.The walls are lined with every style of wine know to man and and bits of info to make you feel like a right connoisseur...i can recommend the third one down! Nice place to pop into if you're in the area.",

What she really meant was wine and nibbles - thank you very much Laura!This is a cute little rustic wine bar with a heap of atmosphere and character. From exposed stone walls to a yummy selection of seasonal nibbles it screams class and culture. Plonked in Borough I was actually grateful to find it wasn't over run with tourist, obviously the selection around here for great eating spots means that the spread themselves out.A bit on the pricey side but great for early evening snacks, maybe with a date or a girlie friend for a catch up - mmmm...I'm cooking up some plans!",
