Inc service for a bowl I felt a little empty. \u00a0I too rarely leave soup in my bowl but on both occasions I had to leave almost half my bowl of soup from lack of flavour and salt. It's a good try and I'll love to see it get better, but currently it's below average for the price they're asking, the only thing I love at this place is the decor and the 2 slices of pork in the tonkotshu, thank you British pork.",

The atmosphere is nice with the walls lined with Japanese style sheets and dangly lightbulbs. \u00a0Don't get why they cage their lightbulbs though, yes I'm talking bird cage which isn't Japanese more birdese.Service isn't great, I asked for water and she gave me a thumbs up but ignored me for a good while whilst serving other people instead. After an eye to eye the waitress decided to give me the water after the wait.Oh, and if you ever want to hear the gossip of London, you should definitely go here. It's like sharing a table at the school canteen and the guys next to me were talking about how their friend was sleeping around with another woman he worked with at the office.

    "text": "Given my experience of eating ramen before going to this restaurant was limited to Wagamama (urgh) and maybe one or two other restaurants, I didn't really have a high watermark to compare it to. I didn't really have many expectations thus. The menu is sparse, but seemed to be adequate and it's always refreshing to see a briefer menu. Something about it says \"we're so confident in these few dishes we offer\". My gf and I both went for the regular ramen, after starters of Gyoza, which was very nice. Next, we were both brought out a very generous portion of ramen, complete with a floating hard boiled (yet runny yoaked) egg. The broth was excellent, as if somebody had been able to distill the pure essence of pork into a liquid. It was almost too 'porky' tasting. Very very rich, but great. The pork belly and noodles floating in the broth were above criticism.They serve a nice range of craft beers and the pricing was what you'd expect for a hip new restaurant in the heart of Soho. Service wasn't amazing, even though our server was friendly, they seemed very hard to get hold of and somewhat forgetful. Shortly after trying this place we went to Ittenbari on Brewer St. which I preferred. I would go back to Tonkotsu, but perhaps only if we couldn't get in to Ittenbari I think.",

(Hell, it's also what a Pot Noodle is, essentially.)But in London several restaurants have popped up here recently that are dedicated to it.In Japan, the perfect end to a boozy night out is a steaming bowl of noodle soup full of slices of roast pork, marinated soft-boiled eggs, beansprouts and spring onions. It might sound healthy, but it ain't - most ramen contains a hefty shot of animal fat.This noodle dish's status as the Japanese version of a greasy, late-night kebab isn't lost on Tonkotsu's chefs. The ramen at this new stall is big and bad, but in the best way possible.Owing as much to New York's current ramen craze as it does to Japan, Tonkotsu exudes machismo - echoing the Big Apple's noodle soup trend. A good ramen has three key components: a well flavoured broth, bouncy noodles and interesting toppings.Tonkotsu, a variety of ramen made with long-simmered bone broth (20 hours in this case), had a flavour so intense it was reminiscent of a Sunday roast, and marbled with lip-smacking pork fat. Testament to this soup's Chinese - not Japanese - roots, Tonkotsu also serves Tokyo Spicy - soy-sauce pork and chicken stock topped with pulled chilli pork.The flavours are big and bold; the dining room tightly packed; the staff are friendly - Tonkotsu is a whole lot of fun as long as you don't mind a short wait for your rightful spot at the table of ramen.",

Forgot that we ordered the Gyoza (despite putting the order in the computer)Finally, that same waitress decided to spray perfume at the counter on herself, we could visibly see that the perfume got onto other dishes (thank god not ours)So while the food was good, the prices cheap (again, SOHO standards), the waitress was so useless that I will probably not return again (unless the wait at neighboring \u00a0Koya is less than 15 mins)",

Gyozo - I was impressed. \u00a0i think i believe that they are truly handmade2. Spinach/sprouts salad - refreshing, hint of peanut sauce3. Pickled cucumber - would rate higher if i could taste the pickled parts4. Tonkotsu - sadly underwhelming. \u00a0the noodles were tasteless, broth was ok. \u00a0only saving grace was the pork belly. \u00a0really unimpressive.So don't go if you are looking for great noodles...Chinatown is a 50 meters away for that.",

I really want these guys to do well and I feel that with a few minor improvements I'd be delighted to give them 4 or 5 stars.I've scored them 3 stars because we were disappointed with the Tonkotsu. I'm really fussy when it comes to noodles. The broth was ok but the noodles were not right - there was too much starch residue in the broth and noodles. My personal belief is that the noodles where not run under water just before serving like you would if you were making pasta at home. The net effect is that the dish doesn't quite like upto it's billing. The noodles didn't quite have the right texture. I was looking for a 'bouncy', chewy texture but it just wasn't there.On the plus side, the Tokyo was good and clean and didn't have the problems I encountered with the Tonkotsu. I would also like to say the Karaage Chicken was superb...even better than the places I tried in Japan. It was so good I ordered it twice! :-)",

The menu is simple \u00a0only 3 different ramen noodle soups (including a vegetarian option), as well as 3 different types of gyoza, some sides, and a mochi ice cream dessert.The broth the noodles came in were probably the best I've ever had \u00a0so full of flavour, and it doesn't leave you with that dry mouth taste after the meal as its all natural and they don't use MSG. Even the eggs in the noodles were done to perfection \u00a0cooked and then marinated in soy sauce overnight.Service was a bit slow though \u00a0it could have been because it was a packed full house the evening I went. However, I think they could turn around orders faster than they did.Price-wise, \u00a311 for a bowl of ramen noodles at first seem a bit steep \u00a0but given the quality, there's no comparison in London.Read my longer review at The London Insider with pictures!",

    "text": "I've looked forward to the time I could try out Tonkotsu. When the minds behind this were still looking for a space and ran Tsuru Ramen pop-up to test out recipes, I was a frequent customer going to no less than 3 of their pop-up sessions. Each time, I loved the ramen that was served up, devoured as many servings \u00a0of gyoza and kara-age as I could, and revelled in the sweetness of the Umeshu and the dry crisp flavour of the cold sake. My main gripe was that it was bloody hard to get tickets for the very limited seating pop-up sessions so the idea of a permanent location serving such wonderful noodle offerings was A+ in my book.Unfortunately, like so many pop-ups/food trucks turned brick and mortar, something has been lost. I don't know if I should attribute this to the need to be more cost-effective, the difficulties in catering to larger numbers of people continuously, or a transition from owner-driven to employee-prepared. Whatever it is, the end result is a poor shadow of the glory of the Tsuru pop-ups and it seems that they've taken all the great research and feedback they must have got during the pop-up time (and I know that a number of Yelpers and myself had a long chat with one of the owners during the pop-up meal) and thrown it out the window. Even in its relatively short life as a brick and mortar, Tonkotsu has modified its menu with the most notable change being the replacement of the Tokyo Spicy broth (which alone was a reason to go) with a generic shoyu (soy-based) broth.First, this is a no-reservation place to be prepared to wait. We were crowded into the narrow entrance/exit portion \u00a0which meant you get pressed into everyone like sardines (think the Northern line at peak times) and even more so when someone tries to get out. The only benefit is that you get to watch the guys make the Ramen but the chefs studiously ignore everyone. Come on, guys, if you are going to have an open plan kitchen in the window and next to the line of hungry customers, get some entertainment going which would make us all a lot happier about waiting.Finally, after about 20 minutes, the two of us were lead to an upstairs table. Now they've crammed the covers in (which I don't mind too much) but it does mean there is no space for jackets, bags, and anything else you may be carrying (in my case, cycle helmet and some shopping). The menu is fairly limited with a handful of starters and sides and three types of Ramen: Tonkotsu (pork broth), Tokyo (soy-based broth), and a mushroom and miso broth. The gyoza looked a bit gummy (we got a close view of the table next to us who ordered it) so we opted for the kara-age and tempura prawns. Both were decent with a good crunchy coating and very little oiliness. Both could also have done with a bit more seasoning or perhaps a bit more sauce to dip in but overall an adequate start to the meal. Ramen-wise, we ordered a Tonkotsu and a Tokyo. I asked what happened to the Tokyo Spicy and was informed that I could just add chilli oil to the Tokyo to make it spicy. Now, first off, that's completely different from a broth that has been designed to be spicy and second, the chilli oil had about as much heat as a snowball.The Tonkotsu was extremely disappointing and lacked in flavour. Now I don't mean it wasn't as meaty as I wanted it to be, but rather that it wasn't meaty at all and tasted of water that may have seen some pork in passing. The pieces of meat were limp and greasy (not in a good way!) that made you feel as if they had been boiled down for the stock and then thrown back in. Which would be acceptable had there been any taste to the broth. The Tokyo was better although the meat was still disappointing. The egg was tasty and well seasoned but there were few veggies and the noodles could have done with a little more cooking time. I'd wager the broth wasn't hot enough before being poured over the noodles which caused this problem. A bit unacceptable when this is quite literally your stock in trade.The best part of the meal was the end, and I mean that only partially due to dessert. We got a selection of mochi to share: chocolate, salted caramel, and yuzu (a lemony fruit). The chocolate was good but a bit generic, the salted caramel tasty although could use a bit more salt for my personal tastes, and the yuzu incredible. Yuzu has a delicate lemon flavour that both teases and refreshes. In a mochi (a \u00a0ball of ice cream covered in a thin sweet and soft dough), the balance between sweetness and tartness is perfect.Drinks were average with two of the four cocktails involving umeshu, a plum wine. Which is fine, as long as you have umeshu...which of course they didn't. How do you run out of something that central to your cocktail menu at 7pm on a Friday? And if you do, run down the street to Chinatown or Japan Centre and buy it! So a drinks fail as our first two choices were not available and we ended up with some tea. Bah!",

    "text": "How much did I want to like tonkotsu? Way too much. My experience with new-wave Ramen bars in London has not been ideal. Traditional Japanese places seem to be the only ones who get the job done the right way. My Ramen-obsessed friend recently advised that they are so amazing because they make their own noodles whereas other places don't.Walking in and getting a seat was easy, post-Christmas London is dead and you can go anywhere without queuing. \u00a0Once sat down (mind you, at the back where each chair faces the wall) we had a look at the menu that was also written in Japanese. Japanese! These people know what they're doing!I took a minute to suppress my need to try the soft shell crab. I'm aware such places are not experts and I'm usually left with a greasy piece of white meat that tastes nothing like crab.Some slightly burnt pork gyoza and 3 crispy king prawn katsu later, I wasn't feeling the love. I couldnt see the sparkle in the food, but I only assumed this was because it was a starter and I had to wait for the mains. I went for noodles afterall! The king prawn katsu was proper nice though the sauce was way OTT. So I had them with some lemon juice rather. The pork gyoza were ah-k. Slightly burnt underneath and with the typical industrialised gyoza flavour you can find just about anywhere. Apologies, hand-made or not, I don't easily see the difference in it.My Tokyo Ramen arrived minutes later. I looked at it and I instantly sensed it needed something. Something more. It came with a few slices of green onion, 3 somewhat decent pork pieces, half an egg and some bamboo (oh and some manma that i dont know what it is).Tastewise, yes, it was good. It wasn't served in a Bone-Daddies-oil-laden-pool of a bowl but it tasted heavy of meat. I attacked the chilli oil and soy sauce and things got better.Halfway though, I had lost most of my excitement and I was just noisily slurping to finish off my bowl. The broth was OK, yes, but the pork had a massive slab of fat. Not the sexy type of charred fat, the ugly fatty type. I ate it all as I was hungry.I will most likely return, when Koya is not open.",

The broth is absolutely delicious and rich, a sign that it has been made over a long period of time. The egg is absolutely perfect and I have always been happy with my meal. I've introduced Tonkotsu to many others and they all have enjoyed it as much as I have. However, I am taking a star away because the service is not that great, yet they tag on a 12.5% service charge.

The gyoza was probably the only memorable thing on the menu that we had. The dining area was beautiful and modern. The restrooms downstairs was a scary steep way down and very dirty inside.Staff was bleh.crave-o-meter 3 out of 10",

This is a low key, casual Japanese eatery specialising in delish bowls of noodles served up in a pork broth (simmered for 18hrs to be specific) filled with flavoursome and tender shredded pork topped off with half a semi soft boiled egg & lovely tasty veg.They also serve Tonkotsu ramen (pork bones make an appearance here as part of the broth,think creamy, rich moments) which is also faaarkin delish!Sides of loveliness, including edamame, tofu, deep fried chicken to name but a few, are there to add to this lovely experience of food heaven (if you like noodle dishes that is, if you don't normally, give this place a try, bet it will leave you wanting access to this particular food heaven too).Sake is also star of this eatery, as are the lovely wait staff.Yeah, faaarkin tasty as faark!

    "text": "Tonkotsu is definitely the real deal when it comes to ramen. They're doing 50% off until Sunday off all food, so get down there!We were lucky enough to get a table today after a short queue. The menu is very short - a selection of appetizers such as gyozas, edamame, and then two choices of ramen. You can choose from 'tonkotsu' or 'miso' broths. The ramen is really really good, and the broth is so flavourful. You can definitely taste the richness of the broth, and the egg is a bright shade of orange and with just enough gooey-ness. The pork is not too fatty + you get two slices of moist delicious pork. The noodles are definitely on the chewier sides as opposed to soft, which is how I like them cooked.Service was definitely slow - we had to ask for the bill twice, and the appetizers basically arrived at the same time as our ramen. I can't really deduct any points for that because they're haven't officially opened yet.This is definitely my new go-to spot for ramen. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "In a word, boring. It promises a lot. And looks rather nice from the outside too. But it's nothing special. Don't be fooled by the cheeky bit of hiragana on the menu, nor the implicit focus on the broth by putting the soup maker dude at the front of the place. I had the tonkotsu and the pork gyoza. The gyoza were okay, but not really much better than buying frozen gyoza from Japan Centre and making them myself. The tonkotsu was starting to head in the right direction, but didn't really get there. The broth was slightly porky, but frankly far too healthy. Proper tonkotsu should have fat globlets floating on the surface. It was also rather too bland. Yes it had pork flavouring to an extent, but it ended there, abruptly. Thank god for the garlic and the chili. Alas an opportunity to make it taste like it should. Not enough broth either, nor egg. Apparently they used to do a whole egg with the dish, is an extra half egg that much of a stretch these days? Oh and the chashu (pork). Boring boring boring. Just do something with it to make it more interesting. Smoke it, maybe cure it a little. But it's dry (somehow!), lukewarm and disappointing. But hey, let's look on the bright side here for at least part of a paragraph, it's a hell of a lot better than the 'ramen' one expects from wagamamas/pot noodle, and it's showing that the London ramen scene is vaguely starting to head in the right direction. There's just a lot of work to be done. Oh and it's pricy, even compared to Tokyo. Next stop, bonedaddies.",

    "text": "For all the new ramen options in Central London these days, I was sort of surprised by how amateur Tonkotsu seems to be. The noodles were undercooked and chewy in both my husband's signature ramen and my Tokyo ramen. The pork was chewy and very fatty--not nicely marbled, just fatty. The waitstaff also took great offense to being told that their tapped Asahi had gone awry. The flavor was very metallic. After my husband didn't drink his, the waitress tasted it with a straw and declared it to be fine. We paid for it anyway. And while I'm on the subject of waitstaff. Maybe they could find a more appropriate time to walk about whinging to one another about their work schedules. Just a thought. The only bright spot was the karaage. While a tad greasy, the coating was flavorful and crunchy. However, fried chicken alone is not enough to make me come back here.",

If they are confident enough to name the restaurant after their signature then it must be good!I stopped in for a late lunch (no queues) and ordered the tonkotsu ramen, pork gyoza, and an Aspall Cider (goes great with pork). I sat outside and got a great view of the busy Soho streets as I ate!The gyoza came out quickly, and they were hot, fresh, and crispy. The skins were a bit thicker than I like them, but that's not really a huge gripe. I wish I could have mix and matched the various flavors so I could try all the dumplings, but I understand why they couldn't do that. They were great with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili oil.The tonkotsu ramen had a shio tare, and I detected a lot of ginger in the broth as well. It was relatively rich and was pretty good. The noodles were cooked well (though I usually like them to be a bit harder), and it was topped with bean sprouts, scallions, bamboo, chashu, and half of a soft-boiled marinated egg. Solid bowl of ramen.I liked that when you order kaedama (extra noodles), they bring it to you in a bowl with some more broth. You don't usually see that, and it's pretty generous.The staff was very friendly and I chatted for a while about ramen in general and learned more about the industry scene here.Strong spot for ramen in London for sure!",

I would say that compared to ramen in Kyoto it's a bit saltier and it would be nice to have more than a couple of thin slices of pork. Then again it does make for a healthier meal out option and you'll not feel hungry. Is this in my top places to eat... Perhaps not.

And then my main, a nice pot of tonkotsu ramen. Oh yes, the broth looked milky (not the weak nearly transparent stuff elsewhere in town). Anticipation...So much pork. It pulled apart so I could put a bite with each mouthful. The noodles are homemade (look to your right when you walk in) and are cooked to the right consistency. And the egg, just shy of being fully cooked. Perfect.Seriously this was the best ramen I've had \u00a0in London. Yes \u00a0it's \u00a311 but it's a nice ambience,not rushed at all, and really good.And do not shy away from the chili oil with bits! It's not that spicy and so yummy. I bought two jars to bring home. The manager couldn't have been nicer to make the jars fresh for me and engage I so me conversation - about the personalized photo on my credit card.I left full and with a smile. Well done Tonkotsu.Oh...my big thing about refilling water. A+ to our waitress who came round often \u00a0and without me ever noticing!",

Although it was different from any other, it gave me all the lovely ramen comfort of a thick, flavourful broth, fresh veggies, and filling noodles. Every element was unique, from the aroma of the broth to the texture of the noodles. The mushrooms in my Shimeji, Shiitake & Miso Ramen were extraordinary and the smoked haddoc crowning my friend's Soho Ramen was simply amazing too.Although we were seated upstairs, where the atmosphere is less cozy and the air conditioning a bit cold, the interior is nice and modern and the staff is friendly.As there's no more than a choice of 5 different ramen (2x pork, chicken, fish, and mushroom) it's logical that there's only a single vegetarian version but I think it was good enough to make me return for that one.",

The flavor of the egg just wasn't that great, and the pork was a little tough. This might be because they don't slice the pork here. Most ramen I have had the pork is sliced thin.

    "text": "I promised an update when I re-visited after the restaurant had officially opened. I last visited on their soft opening week.So, what changes? Firstly, they've opened an upstairs seating area though I was seated at the kitchen counter. This area was actually a bit disapppointing - most chef's counters are fun because you can see the chefs hard at work, which is great for a foodie like me and sometimes you get teh chance to chat to them. The chef's counter at Tonkotsu is very low and it feels quite isolated but fortunately, I had my iPhone to entertain me as the lighting was too dim to readMy favourite style of ramen is tonkatsu ramen. Incidentally, Kevin L and I weren't sure whether there's any difference between tonkatsu and tonkotsu ramen and he thought it may differ according to whether beef bones are used in the making of the stock. In any case, I love that the most because a good tonkatsu stock is so full of fatty goodness and flavour which comes from boiling it for hoursI supplemented the ramen with some tofu. Described as silken on the menu and home made by the waiter, I was glad to be able to confirm that the large slab of tofu was indeed very smooth - the toppings of bonito flakes and spring onion were enhanced with a little dash of soya sauce, on advice from the waiterThen came the piece de resistance - the tonkotsu ramen. The first impression was that the stock looked a little pale, unlike other tonkatsu ramens that I had eaten. However, I dived in with an open mind and it was certainly a big improvement on the Tokyo spicy ramen I had had before. It tasted meaty but still lacked the power and wholesome artery-destroying goodness of the stock of somewhere like Cocoro. However, in mitigation, the pork chashu was really tender and the egg was yolk-quiveringly perfectI was struggling to decide on the final star rating when I suddenly realised the acid test. When I leave Cocoro, the bowl is empty because I've slurped every last drop of the stock but at Tonkotsu, the stock remained in the bowl. So, despite Tonkotsu being \u00a32 cheaper, Cocoro still holds the 'Yee Gan Best Tonkotsu Ramen in London' title",

Came here on a Saturday night, and there were no lines (though the waiter staff did tell us in a condescending tone, \"here's how you form a queue - one after the other - see, that's how you queue\"). Ordered the bowl of Tonkotsu ramen - the soup was not as thick as expected and noodles were bland. The mochi was the lowlight of the meal - they were completely frozen and even after letting them sit at the table to defrost, the taste and texture were below standard.",

What I love about this place is there are no hidden extras compared to other places which make you buy extra eggs and meat for your dish. As I said above, this place is very popular so expect a queue outside at peak time. (Visit - 18/07/2015 Lunch)",

The menu explained that the home-made ramen noodles were cooked exactly 32 seconds and to tell them if you wanted something different. They also said, that any shop that didn't make their own noodles was just a soup shop.I ordered pork fried gyoza and their tonkotsu ramen - what should be their key basic order.The gyoza was fine. It was what you might expect in an average ramen place in Japan. Slightly small and on the light side.The tonkotsu ramen wasn't too big, which was fine for me. However, the soup was really thick. Tonkotsu stock is made from pork bones and lard so it is traditionally fairly thick, but this was unusually so in my opinion. It was also very un-salty --- this isn't a bad thing, but tasted kind of \"off\" for my palette. There was soy sauce but no extra salt on the table so I couldn't \"fix\" it. My slightly outdated impression of the UK was that everything was salty but maybe that's an old impression and London has swung the other way and become sodium-conscious, but the soup was very salt-free from a Japanese ramen baseline.The noodles with skinny and cooked just right. No complaints there. The roast pork was fine - fairly standard.They had a Tokyo style chicken ramen with clear broth which I might try next time.I'll try again sometime and try another ramen. I won't be ordering their signature tonkotsu ramen again, though.The staff were friendly and there were lots of interesting things on the menu such as hiyashi (cold) ramen and interesting cocktails that I'd like to try.",

The broth looked very rich but was disappointed by the taste - it was bland. The noodles were nice, bouncy but firm. Sad that the broth didn't deliver the taste.

I ordered the tonkotsu and found the flavor a bit bland for what is supposed to be 16-hour long marinated base. The portions on the starters were also quite small for the price, although they were very tasty. After all was said and done, the waitress didn't give us a check after clearing our table for probably about 15 or 20 minutes, while we sat there waiting, empty table and all. She walked past us multiple times without gauging that it was time for the check, until when I finally asked her she responded \"oh, had you already asked?\" which seemed to imply that it was our faults for not asking her in the first place. I thought maybe it was a U.K. thing but since going to other restaurants and being handed a check as normal after food is eaten, decided that the service just wasn't very good at Tonkotsu.",

It's not a big menu they have. Mostly Ramen, some Gyoza and a few sides. But that's fine, better have a small menu and do it right.We've been in Japan before and know good Ramen. It's not an easy thing to get right. So we didn't expect anything. But the Ramen (the \"Tonkotsu\") turned out to be pretty good. Flavours were good and the broth quite rich. It's not on par with the real Japanese Ramen, but for what it is, it was a good meal. Could have had more \"oomph\", could be richer, but for a Ramen Shop in Soho, London it's not a bad meal at all. For drinks we had some Sake and Asahi.Service was a bit unexperienced, but very friendly.",

    "text": "I'm always reading comments in re to the battle of the best ramen joint between Bonedaddies and Tonkotsu... Well, for me, based on the Tonkotsu ramen it's still TONKOTSU hands down. I'm always a little skeptical when going to Gaijin run Japanese joints but Tonkotsu has always been consistent in taste. Their own made noodles are just the perfect consistency, the broth has depth, it's cloudy but not fatty and oily. Egg was perfect and pork delicious. Perfect sized bowl of ramen to make you happy. I also ordered the hiyayakko tofu (chilled tofu), which definitely was super chilled, maybe a bit too chilled for my liking but had a super silky texture and was delicious with their own made chilli. Def the place to go for tonkotsu ramen. Note: they take a break between services so are shut between 3pm-5pm",

It's maybe the 4th best in London.. The broth just doesn't have that really yummy taste which you associate with tonkotsu ramen. I did eat here a couple of times, but just because the restaurant is conveniently located in Soho and the ramen does satisfy a ramen crazing.I did have the salted caramel ice-cream sandwich for dessert which was very yummy! The gyoza are good too (better than gyoza's at Gyoza Bar in Covent Garden!). The interior of this restaurant is nice too. Paid \u00a348 for 2 starters, 2 ramens, 2 soft drinks and dessert.I would recommend to come here if you're interested in the ramen that London has to offer.",

I got the Tokyo ramen, with pork and chicken stock, classic noodles, bamboo shoots, marinated and braised pork belly, and a seasoned egg. The ingredients were on point, but the execution failed. The noodles weren't al dente enough, the meat base was overwhelmed by soy sauce, and the pork belly was dried out. Too bad, because as I said, the service is great. If you sit at the bar, you get really friendly, attentive service not just from your server, but from the cooks.",

Came here after getting up its misty outside, craving for a good bowl of ramen... then here it is.. tried three flavors: vege, seafood and original. The original blows me away, the broth is creamy and rich, the pork inside is so tasty, tender and I even ate the fatty part! The noodle is handmade and has great texture to it.. great bowl of ramen! The vege bowl is ok .. the seafood bowl has lots of crab meat inside which makes broth tastes like seafood, clean and delicious... depends on your mood but I'll always go with the original one!",

    "text": "Having read about Tonkotsu in the press, but cross-checking it with Yelp reviews, Tonkotsu didn't make my list of places that I must try while walking around Soho. \u00a0That being said, as my fiance and I were in search of food after hitting up Milroy's for whiskey, and a pint at Dog & Duck, we found ourselves wandering around the area looking for something that would hit the spot on a chilly (but pleasant) October night. \u00a0Randomly, I came across Tonkotsu and immediately said, \"WAIT! I've read about this place! Let's try it!\". \u00a0Having come from San Francisco, born and raised in LA, and with someone who spends a fair amount of time in New York, both of us were ready and eager to see what Tonkotsu brought to the table from a ramen perspective.I confess that my last ramen experience in the UK was Wagamama, and I really only have one word that sums of that experience: waste of time. \u00a0So, when Tonkotsu rolled out a bowl of beautiful pork stock and thin noodles topped with slices of pork belly, half an egg, menma, bean sprouts and spring onions, I was thoroughly impressed! \u00a0The stock was more flavourful that I was expecting, and not overly salty or rich like I've had at other places. \u00a0The noodles were al dente, which is also a change from what I'm used to, but not in a bad way. \u00a0The bowls came out incredibly fast, so service here was on point.On the other hand, a few things that were a little disappointing: the egg and the pork. \u00a0The egg was not exactly soft-boiled, I'd describe it more like 90% on its way to being hard-boiled. \u00a0And, the inside of it was cold. \u00a0I definitely prefer the creamy egg with a soft-warm middle. \u00a0And then the pork. \u00a0Unfortunately I think most people here have had the same general experience with the pork where it's slightly overcooked (which I would gather gives it the \"soft\" texture) but lacked a lot of flavor and was sort of just chewy.A girl next to me ordered the Tokyo ramen, which also looked delicious, but it seemed fitting to order the namesake dish this time around. \u00a0Overall, not a bad place to randomly come across, I know that Tonkotsu definitely exceeded my expectations when it came down to a bowl of soup in London.",

Don't be fooled by the lack of a queue outside. The place can seat plenty. We ordered the gyoza, pork and prawns, and both were good. And all us had the house special--the Tonkotsu. The broth was rich, creamy, and spiced perfectly. Served with pork, booked egg, and spiced bamboo shoots. But the winner was the noodles. They were thin, perfectly cooked, and held the broth well. Well worth the visit.",

You could be so good (apart from the Tonkotsu!)It took me a while to try this place (I was excited by the good reviews and worried by the bad reviews) I mean Andrew even gave them one star! I reserve 1 star reviews for truly crappy companies like BT, Virgin and tesco extra...how could a ramen shop possibly be that bad!?Well...it wasn't that bad, in fact, most of it was truly excellent:- 5* - The karaage chicken was gooood. You could taste all the lovely marinated flavours and it was succulent on the inside and uber crunchy on the outside. - 5* - The gyoza are handmade, so don't expect them to look pretty, but the taste was fantastic. They also provide all the right condiments If you're not sure what to do: add some vinegar, soy and spicy oil into the dipping space... then dunk before you eat. You'll look like a pro.- 4* - The Tokyo ramen was really good, almost as good as Ittenbari. The pork belly meat was lovely, the egg was squidgy (although a bit chilled) the broth was good, but better with some spice from the chilli oil.But...- 2* - Unfortunately the Tonkotsu itself was a bit disappointing. The broth has a good creamy texture, but just didn't taste of much, and the meat was chewy and fatty (but not in a melt-in-your-mouth-joy fatty way ...just tough and unpleasant)So, I liked it, but I wouldn't come back for the actual tonkotsu soup. p.s. I heard a few people ordering karaage and pronouncing it \"ca-rage\" with a soft g (Eeep!) Please try to say \"ka-ra-a-geh\" otherwise I am pretty sure somewhere-or-other Japanese chicken fairies will be dying of language-massacre-despair.",
