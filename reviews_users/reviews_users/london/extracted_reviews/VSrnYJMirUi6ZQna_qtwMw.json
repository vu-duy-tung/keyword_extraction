We both started off with soya iced coffees and they were really nice. My sister had the All American with pancakes, bacon, sausage, home fries and egg. I had the Reggie the Veggie with veggie sausage, egg, home fries, and grilled tomatoes. The food was really good and we both left with our bellies full. The only complaint I had was that the 3 servers we had were not very attentive. We had to ask for the bill 3 times and it took them ages to bring it. We also struggled to get their attention to ask for some more napkins. Overall the meal was nice, we just hope next time the staff are a bit more alert.",

    "text": "I was so excited to check out the new Breakfast Club, and we were not disappointed. The restaurant on the ground floor is a dimly-lit, cozy American style diner with the standard fare of burgers and the like. We came here on a Saturday night for some drinks and to check out the secret bar. There was plenty of space in the restaurant around 8PM - seems like they're new enough that there's no need to book ahead.It is well-known that there are secret speakeasys inside Breakfast Club locations, hidden in cheeky places like through refrigerator doors. To gain access into the bar, you have to say the phrase \"I'm here to get lucky\" when you are greeted by the host.Then it's through the back, past some storage boxes, down a flight of stairs, around a corner, and whooosh! You're in a dark room illuminated only by fairy lights. Get there early to nab one of the two alcove booths that can seat up to 8 or 9 people, depending on how friendly y'all are ;) Beers are \u00a33.5-4 and a cocktail will run you \u00a38. Try the rose-flavored cocktail - it's delicious, strong, and humongous! You can also order food downstairs. What a cool experience, and so close to my stomping grounds. Go soon, because when everyone catches on, this location will no doubt become crowded.",

We'd gone on the opening weekend (you could actually BOOK!) and they seemed to be in the swing of things by mid-morning on Sunday. The decor is kitsch, open and quirky. There was also a DJ playing on that weekend (which seems to be a regular thing!), however the loos had a different soundtrack on, strangely.I had a massive pile of mashed avocado, chillies and chorizo on english muffins, topped off with poached eggs. Very good. My breakfasting partner had american pancakes with maple syrup - very good indeed (I sneaked a bite or three). We shared the peanut butter milkshake to-go, which in hindsight was overkill, but at the time seemed like the most rational thing to do... There's a lot on the menu, some of which looks more over-priced than others. Nonetheless, it was a tasty and filling meal. I imagine it's the same as the other branches in that regard.",

When attempting to get the attention of one waitress, she initially pretended not to hear my repeated calls for her attention then eventually turned in my direction, mouthed something to me and walked off. No explanation or apology. The waiter who was predominantly serving us was equally ill mannered and uninterested. When asked for orange juice, he explained that the 'Breakfast Club' was out of orange juice if you can believe that and he was unaware when they would restock it. When asked for bottled still water, he had a similar response explaining \u00a0the only \u00a0option was tap. He was again, unapologetic and verging on rude.

Determined to try everything on the menu!So far I've had: Pancakes and berries- absolutely incredible but prepare to be unable to eat anything else for the rest of the day. I'd recommend you share them with someone.Post sausage sandwich- delicious, the ingredients worked so well together, definitely one I'll be having again.Hash potatoes- a bit disappointing, kind of tasteless.Banana French toast- beautiful but not enough banana or syrup for my liking.Apple cinnamon French toast- you get given a lot of apple which was good, think I preferred this to the banana one. Both French toasts had 4 big thick slices of toast which were very filling.Porridge- a bit bland, not enough dried fruit in it. Definitely not worth the price.Bircher muesli- delicious and you get a huge bowl of the stuff. Again, not much dried fruit but the flavour of the muesli meant that it wasn't really missed.Banana muesli- again absolutely moorish, like a strawberry and banana smoothie, loved it. Both mueslis had a thick texture and made for a good, filling, semi-healthy breakfast.Breakfast smoothie- very nice, topped with muesli flakes which I thought was a nice touch. Large, I wouldn't recommend pairing it with one of the bigger breakfast items.Falafel wrap- disappointing, small and average yet relatively expensive. Side salad wasn't much to boast about either. I'll probably stick with the breakfast items next time.Do not attempt to go during peak times or at weekends, the queue outside becomes ridiculous. You can take away food for a slightly lower price.",

The guy who seated us was very helpful, but then things started to get worse and worse... It took probably 25 minutes for the waitress to come and get our orders. They instead like to dance and tease each other. To be fair our waitress was fine, but couple of things really annoyed me in this place.I asked for a high chair to one of the other waitresses, and she didn't bring it. We had to go and find it ourselves. This is so disrespectful, I mean she might have forgotten it but again they dance, tease each other and go to one of the spaces behind to drink whatever they are drinking, and they can't even bring a high-chair for a baby who is crying.Eye contact two times with one of the other waitresses and she totally ignored us. Ignoring in a way that screamed \"I see you are asking for something but I don't care\".One of the waiters, who needs to use the space behind us to get cutlery , use the accounting system etc. dancing like he is in a rap video with all these moves right behind my friends' wife and son. We didn't warn him as we didn't want to spoil our mood but it looked so disrespectful. A happy mood is one thing, doing all these moves right behind people trying to have breakfast is another.We probably had to wait another 30-35 minutes for our breakfast to be served. One of the orders was mixed, so one of our friends had to wait to another 10-15 minutes while we had our breakfast.No soap in the washroom! I mean come on! There are so many staff and they do all these moves and everything but they don't really do what they are supposed to do! This place seemed like one of those places that become trendy and they make you queue outside and then you get inside and see how inefficient they are...With so many staff it's just not what it's supposed to be. They make you feel like they are doing you a favour if you get a table and have some food.Ah, the breakfast, it was just fine. Nothing extraordinary, we had the full monty, pancakes, huevos rancheros. All good but no reason whatsoever to queue for 45 mins to have it and be exposed to this kind of treatment!",

I will definitely be back as the pancakes looked great and I want to try them.",

The bacon was done just as I like it, the eggs were seasoned well, the pancakes themselves were perfect once I added the syrup. My eyes were too big for my stomach and I couldn't finish the potatoes but they were pretty tasty too. Not the best breakfast by far but still very satisfying!",

We were served fairly quickly at the beginning and the waitress was knowledge and was able to make substitutions for one member of our party who had a nut allergy. However the food then was a let down. I had the egg and bacon butty and added sausage too this. This egg was over cooked, as was the bacon. In fact the bacon was cold and was so hard so made me think it had been cooked a while ago as it didn't taste fresh. Two of my friends had the eggs benedict and both said the muffin it was on was stale. Unfortunately no one checked on us so we couldn't really do anything about it and didn't fancy waiting again for more food anyway. Basically once we had been given our food the service was non existent and we eventually had to get up and find someone who'd get us the bill. I probably would not return.",

Think three stars is generous!After the obligatory queue, my boyfriend and got seats...though I don't usually mind communal dining, sharing a booth with two strangers did feel pretty odd! Usually I've ordered pancakes, the breakfast burrito etc, but today I was in the mood for a classic- eggs florentine. When it arrived, I dove in, only to discover it was stone cold. Ugh! After sending it back, I got a fresh plate, although my boyfriend had already finished his meal! The replacement dish, though piping hot, totally missed the mark. Only one of my two eggs was poached properly (hardened yolk is a big no no). The spinach was watery and flavourless- I've had better defrosted frozen spinach to be honest. The muffin was too thick and pretty unappetising. And the hollandaise was a slight let down- I've definitely had better.Would probably have been a two star visit had it not been for the really friendly staff, and the extra coffee for no charge while I waited for meal.",

    "text": "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Hell, it might as well be my mantra: sit at the counter! Five years in London, and I'm still not sure what the aversion to sitting at a counter or bar in a restaurant is. Especially one trying to pass itself off as an American diner. For the uninitiated: there are some diners in the US that don't even have tables. Just a counter/bar. Gasp! The horror! But seriously, the service is so much faster, and while other people queue up--hint: don't--to wait for breakfast, you'll be eating and done long before they're even sat and ordered. Things you should know about this place:- Like the others of its species, The Breakfast Club drips with pure hipster pretension. The only thing missing in the decor is the leg lamp from from A Christmas Story.- The waitresses aren't allowed to write things down; they must punch orders in through the electronic touch pad system. This means they don't carry pens. This is bad for all the American tourists, who end up here before visiting Borough Market.- Which brings me to this one: it's across the road and down a bit from Borough Market. Alarm bells! Down the road the other way are several budget hotels, where many tourists stay, while visiting London. That means this place is on a clear path between the hotels and the market. That means there's usually a queue by 10am. - Which, of course, brings me to this point: don't queue up. Just don't. Eat at the market. Walk to Maltby and get yourself some damn fine coffee from the coffee cart and a custard doughnut from St John Bakery. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw Pablo Escobar in a 'I Heart London' tee in the line the other day. Whatever that's worth.- There's not enough lemon juice in the hollandaise.- The pancakes taste like they came from a box, and that would be fine if it were an International House of Pancakes, which it most definitely is not trying to be. - There's a serious lack of breakfast options in SE1. This was not really a helpful addition.",

There was no flash or kitschy memorabilia just straight up classic food in a comfortable setting. This beats the Soho location for me.We got lucky upon arrival not to wait for a table, and even scored a booth! Service was quick and friendly. Coffee was better than expected. Perhaps they can add drip coffee like Americans serve if they want to make it more authentic but my mocha was good and friend enjoyed her green smoothie.Then came the food, with a diverse menu that represented both America and the UK. You can get a full English breakfast, pancakes, Eggs Benedict, chorizo, toast, mix and match, it all looked tasty. I went with the Huevos Al Benny, a cross between spicy Huevos Rancheros and Eggs Benedict, while my friend opted for Reggie the Veggies, roasted potatoes and vegetables with eggs cooked your way. We gobbled it all down!I like the no frills atmosphere, you don't need to dress up to come here although your dishes are Instagram worthy and delicious. I will definitely be back when I need a good brekkie or lunch, as that is a whole other menu to try. Let's not forget that you get to enjoy it all with a great mix of music. Thumbs up from this American!",

    "text": "I'd been to the Soho one, a week ago and LOVED the food there. So when we got off at Borough market and were looking for a brunch kind of menu, I thought I'd treat my siblings here, since they were quite keen to visit. (This was after a few places higher up my wishlist ranking in the area, turned out to be closed on Monday)We had a short wait. About 10 minutes (around 11:30am on a Monday - when Borough Market is semi closed)The employees were polite, but they just seemed to be a bit disconnected. The reason I mention this, is that the staff at the Soho location are so friendly and enthusiastic, that it adds to the experience. Compared to them, the staff here were almost catatonic in comparison. No smiles when responding, just a blank stare. Often they would just glaze over you when you were trying to catch their attention.The food was quite good (we had the huevos rancheros and the pancake breakfast) and coffees were excellent, but the experience was a let down.",

For those of you not in the know it is not a tribute to the 90's film of the same name (thankfully).I made out booking via email and was pleasantly surprised by the bright and cheery response I received from them. It was very bubbly and made promise to fizzy stuff on arrival.When the day of the booking arrived, we arrived a bit early, but they never missed a beat. Our table was ready with a pot of flowers to indicate it was reserved and no sooner had the menus arrived we were presented with a Buck's Fizz each. Numerous staff wished us a happy anniversary and they didn't miss a beat from taking our order to our food being served to our additional drinks being brought to us. The staff most certainly hep to make this a positive experience.I went for the half monty and was not disappointed. I felt set for the day ahead. Even though it was busy in their you could have a conversation without shouting. \u00a0Even though they had a but if a cue going on at the door we didn't feel as though we had to rush once our food and drink had finished. I most certainly will return to the Breakfast Club and try one or two of the different things on the menu.",

First lesson: expect to wait a while to get a table at peak times. I had the breakfast burrito, which came in a massive portion packed with an assortment of yummy ingredients. I was completely filled after finishing my burrito. One of my friends had fried chicken with waffles, which looked amazing -- note to self to try it next time. I also had mint tea at the end which was delightfully refreshing. Service was top notch. Despite the busy-ness, all the staff members were prompt and helpful. When we asked for extra plates for my friend's bday cake, they kindly brought out everything we'd need, including candles and a lighter. When we shared our cake with them in gratitude, they even gave us a discount on the bill to thank us for sharing! Ambience was typical breakfast club -- diner like, simple and down to earth. All in all, a great place to be on a Sunday morning.",

When you go to the breakfast club, its kind of like you know what you're getting yourself in for - some decent American diner type breakfast food! On this occasion, I opted for the Chorizo hash and a coke. Coming in at \u00a38.50, the Chorizo hash was a mixture of chopped up and fried chorizo, crushed potatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms with a poached egg to top it off. It was very tasty and filling! I couldn't finish it all! It also came with a little pot of what I can only describe as a sour cream and chive sauce and I really was not a fan of that as it had curdled slightly after being placed on top of the hot food. The service was very good and fast - just what I like! Also I like the ambiance of this Breakfast Club as the music was very retro - Aretha Franklin, The Jackson 5 to name a few, however it fits in with the American retro diner decor. And for \u00a312pp - not bad!",

The SoHo location is more on the hipster and artsy side as the whole restaurant is decorated in retro memorabilia and other throwback childhood stuff. The London Bridge location has a more calm and classy looked which I liked. Other than that, the London Bridge location was really good! My friends and I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was delicious!!Staff was great and so was the service! Oddly enough, we were seated quickly and maybe bc we went on a Thursday around noon. Usually each location is packed and there are long lines out the door.Will definitely try to visit each restaurant location when I return to London as each location has its own unique vibe!",

I went there at 9.30 am ish and the music was so loud I felt I was in a concert but the selection of music was good. I went on my own so I was offered the bar seat after 5 minutes waiting at the door. Although I was sitting at the bar I had to wait for someone to serve me. Waited for the food to come out. Waited for the waitress to notice me wanting to pay. Waited to pay and waited to get change back. (You get the idea..)Overall service I \u00a0would say non existence but that's too harsh. But it did make me feel forgotten as they whizzed past me serving others but not noticing me. I also thought sitting at the bar is fine when you are travelling alone but then having bar staff hovering over you whilst eating and also them trying to reach a glass above your head is a bit off putting.The food was good but it was more instagramable than tasty. My egg was over done so no runny yolk. My potatoes were over done but right amount of seasoning. I had butternut squash instead of muffin because I thought it is something different but I will not try this ever again. Not the greatest flavour. Therefore food for me was average but the green juice was the most delicious above all. I would go again but as a group next time and try the pancake instead.",

This place is my new favorite. We are obsessed. I thought I was getting a small dish with the avocado toast, but the piled on the avocado and it was amazing. So much avo. Usually places are stingier with it. Not here! Here it was ripe and they gave a generous amount. I LOVE IT HERE. if you are young and hungry this is for you.

My friend studying abroad said their American breakfast was pretty good, like probably the best pancakes you could get in the area.Service was okay. I was standing awkwardly near the front waiting for someone to acknowledge my existence for a few minutes. Finally someone did to let me know it would be a few more minutes before they can get to me...which was a relief that I was not nonexistent. My friend and I were seated outside, the chairs were a bit uncomfortable and wonky but it was a beautiful day. They provided tap water, which is seriously appreciated for us travelers! I ordered the All American vegetarian breakfast, bc I wanted to see their take on it. It was decent. I really actually enjoyed the the vegetarian \"sausage\" even though it wasn't sausage like at all..it was more like a falafel. Pretty good! The pancakes were okay too, but nothing amazing like the pancakes I've had before.All over decent breakfast place which I'll probably only go back to if there is nothing else I wanted to explore.",

They were busy when we got here and we were only able to sit at the bar, which was fine enough. The place is small but well put together and we were looked after by the counter person who also dealt with drink orders so was pretty much always on hand to help us. We weren't really going for a breakfast dish so the burgers are what we ordered along with just soft drinks as we were heading to a bar later.Note: Kitchen closes at about half nine so be warned!As always, no reservations, and you will have to wait if it's full, the area to wait is fairly small but you could always go outside. The main reason why we ate here was so I could impress someone by being brought down to the secret bar after the meal, but, with a few other decent places to eat around here, the quality of the food here is enough to make it a contender in its own right.",

However in terms of food it wasn't good.I haven't been to the Breakfast club in a while but portions appear to have shrunk. It used to feel like a mission completing the All American breakfast, not so anymore, at least not in this branch. They even commit the crime of cutting your sausage in half to make it look like a busier plate. This also help your sausage get cold. I think (somebody might be able to confirm) that it even used to be 2 sausages when I visited the Hoxton Square branch.I ordered the buttermilk chicken burger and it was overcooked, verging on burnt and dry. I was pretty disappointed. The chips were flooded in salt and unfortunately they didn't have any fresh juices, only from concentrate.So pretty much it felt like I was in a place that was imitating a Breakfast Club. To be honest this is the first time I've been at this new branch and the first time I've visited for dinner. Will definitely not be making the first mistake again and will definitely only visit for breakfast when they will probably have juices.Fix the food and the rest you have down.",
