    "text": "As a ramen junkie, I've been searching for good bowls of ramen everywhere I go. I had heard amazing things about Kanada-Ya, and many claim that it's the best ramen in London, so naturally, I had to go! Also because I'm a huge fan of tonkotsu broths.When I got there (around 1 PM on a Monday), there was a short queue, but nowhere near the legends that I'd heard of. After a friendly conversation with my fellow line waiters, I was seated in the restaurant.To start out, I orderd an ume nigiri. For my main, I ordered the chashu-men with the mayu (black garlic oil) and hanjuku egg. They let you choose the firmness of the noodles; I chose hard because I like my ramen a tad undercooked (al dente?). They use the traditional thin straight noodles, which pairs well with tonkotsu.The ume nigiri was exactly what I expected, the sourness of the pickled plum perked up my palate and made me excited for the meal to come.They had some pickled kimchi-esque cabbage and ginger for you to just add to your dishes, as well as a toasted sesame seed grinder (which I of course used, generously).The ramen came out pretty quickly and looked great. The broth was very good; one of the best tonkotsu broths I've had anywhere, not just London. The mayu was exactly what the broth needed to elevate it to the next level. The egg was a beautiful golden orange, and the slight sweetness of the marinated egg white was great in the savory and rich pork broth. The chashu was tender and melted away, though I would have preferred a slightly thicker cut, with more of a sear.Overall, Kanada-Ya has one of the strongest tonkotsu broths outside of Hakata for sure, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves ramen who is in London. I hope they bring it to NYC soon!",

I have read some good reviews on Ipoudo and I'm hoping that their ramen is just as nice, because the service at kanada ya is absolutely ridiculous.It was a Wednesday night at around 8:30pm. We queued for over 30 minutes which was fine. However, just as we thought the next table available would be ours, suddenly came two people that was at the Back of the queue and just sat down. We asked what was going on and as I was expecting the Guy to tell those two to get back in the queue, he simply said \"sorry there will be a table soon anyway.\" fuming, I ordered my ramen just to find out that they literally have nothing left. No egg, no salmon o nigiri. could the two people that pushed in have taken my last egg?probably.",

    "text": "Wowzas. Was this place worth the wait.Even on a bank holiday monday there was a wait. As one of the first to arrive at around 12.20 there was still a 40 min wait, but it was damn worth it. Even though staring through the window at all the delicious ramen was tough!The place is tiny. I think I counted around 20-25 seats. Two staff and two cooks.Which was nice as the place had a warm cosy feel to it that would be very nice during the winter months.I was going to order the standard ramen (there is not a lot of choice here) but my friend pointed out that they do a special which was detailed on the table. So I ordered the Gekikira Ramen, an \"18 hour pork bone broth, spicy tan tan style minced pork, charshu belly pork, beansprouts, kikurage, negi\" I have no idea what the last two were but it was damn delicious.Service was quick. And the portions were Good. My previous favourite ramen place Shoryu was always excellent and had you full to bursting. However recently they've cut down on the portion sizes and a super stingy with the toppings.Not so here, despite being a little cheaper than Shoryu (minus miso egg which isn't included by default, but a topping) they are quite generous with the meat. I got as much charshu pork belly as I normally get in my Shoryu bowl (note that's pork collar however, a bit more expensive) but I also get here a massive portion of spicy minced pork. Additionally from the orders of the pork collar I saw drifting around whilst Shoryu normally gives you 2-3 really thin slices, here they decorate your whole bowl in the stuff, so you get around 5-6 decently sliced pieces. The broth I haven't mentioned yet is excellent too. It tastes a lot cleaner and clearer than shoryu. Admittedly Shoryu is slightly more flavourful but oh well you can't have everything. Everything else, in terms of ingredients, quality and quantity are spot on.Whilst there we also tried the sour plum onigiri. I didn't really like this much but more personal preference than anything. It was presented very nicely and was a decently sized portion. The only real improvement I can say is that they REALLY need another location as just thinking of the inevitable queue is making me sad.",

As grim as that sounds- that's the most amazing way to go.Hazel, Iz and I actually popped in here after drinks because we thought drinks and desserts first because ramen is always almost packed and we'd try out luck at ippudo. It didn't work. 9.30 and still an hour and half wait. So we popped over to kanada ya instead for a ten minute wait.Loved that they offer different textures of noodles! I go for hard and springy (LOL- im talking about bed shopping, take your mind out the gutter) and garlic. And it's so simple and kanada just do it so well. The service was great, especially for hazel's dietary requirements. They were so accommodating! Take me back here to bathe in broth,Please!",

    "text": "A friend suggested Kanada-Ya for dinner after work on one of the hottest days of the year (23 degrees in London!)... not exactly ramen weather but perfect for waiting in a queue! I have always wanted to try it ever since it opened in the fall last year, when I got the invite to the 50% off soft opening but couldn't make it. I have however dined at its rival Ippudo across the street, which is a much more upscale, modern building with a bar area to wait and a cell phone texting service to let you know when your table is ready. By contrast, Kanada-Ya is a lot more like an authentic hole-in-the-wall. \u00a0We arrived around 7 PM and took our place in the queue, as the restaurant does not take reservations and it only seats about 25 people inside. There is a nice wooden bench to sit on, and the staff bring out menus for you to look at. The queue also moves fairly fast; there were 5-6 people in front of us to start, and we had our seats inside within 20 minutes.We dined at two seats facing the far wall, near kitchen and the toilets, which wasn't particular scenic, but I don't think that is what they are going for. The menu is pretty straightforward - there are 3 main ramen options then a load of topping options. I went for the moyashi ramen, which is like the original ramen but with beansprouts, and then chose to add a hanjuku egg. For a drink I got the Hiver, a London honey beer. This come serves in a cool copper mug, and it tastes exactly like honey. I was sorely tempted by the onigiri rice balls, and meant to order one, but I forgot and it turned out to be a blessing since I couldn't even finish the ramen. My friend got the original ramen without any toppings, and she actually managed to finish her bowl. As for the food, I thought the bowl was good, but nothing spectacular. The egg was good, runny in the middle and interestingly enough, served cold. I ate them first because I didn't want them to sink into the ramen and lose the deliciousness of the yolk. You have the option of choosing the firmness of your noodles; I went with regular, but they just didn't seem like ramen to me - they were very thin and of dry, lacking the usual plumpness. The meat was tasty... we tried for a while to figure out the difference between pork collar and pork belly, but in the end concluded that you can't go wrong with pork belly. Aside from a ton of vegetables, the only other thing to note was the broth - it was good and not too salty. We added some of the mysterious looking pickles on the table halfway through the meal, which turned it actually quite spicy. Overall, it was not a bad meal, but there was nothing screaming at me to declare that this is the best bowl of ramen in London.",

    "text": "Now, I'm no economics expert but I've heard that one of the keys to success for any business is location, location, location. To that end, I was very surprised to see that new ramen restaurant Kanada-Ya have sited themselves right opposite the newly opened 2 storey behemoth international ramen restaurant chain IppudoTo be fair, Kanada-Ya is also an international chain with Japanese founder Kanada Kazuhiro bringing his authentic tonkotsu ramen from Yukuhashi, Japan to the world. However, the dimunitive premises of Kanada-Ya does make it feel like a David v Goliath situation between the neighbouring restaurantsHaving said that, there was a healthy queue outside Kanada-Ya 15 minutes before opening time on the Saturday lunchtime when I visited. In fact, when the restaurant opened, people at the back of the queue had to wait as all the seats were quickly filled upThe menu is short and sweet - 3 versions of tonkotsu ramen, the main difference between the bowls being the cut of pork to make the chashu and a few extra ingredients like beansproutsI went for the original ramen, which came with the 18 hour pork broth, chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori and spring onion. None the options came with an egg, so I added a hanjuku egg for \u00a31.80Kanada-Ya's USP is that they wash the pork bones before using to make the broth. It perhaps made the broth taste a tiny bit more sanitised but being someone who feels that the broth is the most important element of ramen, I did enjoy it but perhaps not as much as Bone Daddies where I usually drink most of it whereas here, I left a lot of it behindMy noodles came 'normal' as requested, which were fine for me. The chashu pork belly was suitably moist if rather thin. The wood ear fungus added texture and I was glad there were no beansprouts (I'm looking at you, Shoryu!)The bowl here is certainly worthy of entering my top 4 ramen restaurant rotation alongside Bone Daddies, Ippudo and Cocoro but my favourite still remains Bone Daddies, who also have the amazing Korean guinea fowl and sticky bonesKanada-Ya only serve onigiri rice balls alongside their ramen but I didn't try any on this occasion",

    "text": "What a treat. This place is fantastic. Both the food and the service were top notch.The food: We had the chashu-men ramen and the tonkatsu ramen and both were some of the best I've had. I don't pretend to be a ramen connoisseur but I've been to a half dozen ramen places in the United States and tasted bad ramen and good. The ramen here is as good as the best I've had yet.Price: It's a little steep for what it is. The chashu ramen is 13 pounds and the tonkatsu is 10.5, and if you want an egg in it that's 2 pounds extra; though that egg is tasty and adds a hearty flavor to the dish so you might as well go for it. There is a 10% service charge added to the bill automatically.The location: It's a corner shop so it's easy enough to find once you get close, though it's not exactly close to a metro station. The place is very small though and seating is limited. We had to wait outside for a few minutes but the person at the door will happily hand you a menu to look at while you wait.The service: I save this category for last because it so blew me out of the water. I've been to many European countries over the years and eaten a lot of different places and I have never had a server offer to refill my non-tea/coffee drink for free. I assumed that refilled drinks were simply a custom in the United States alone. Heck, you are lucky if a waiter even drops by your table after the food is delivered to check that everything is alright. Today I was proven wrong as helpful staff (more than just one) came by our table not once, not twice, but three times in our roughly 30 minute meal to not only check that everything was to our pleasure but also refill our water: the free tap water we were drinking. I legitimately felt bad that I didn't have enough hard cash on me (we were paying by card) to pay for an exceedingly generous tip but I left them all I had (a little under a pound). If you are there and have as good an experience as I did leave a few extra pence for me.",

We thought they must be hungry! \u00a0But, it was definitely the right call as we both had a lot of tasty broth left at the end. \u00a0It is like having a 2nd ramen which, of course, I am in favour of.The restaurant is a short walk away from Tottenham Court Road tube station, but Holborn is another nearby option. \u00a0We got there late on Saturday night and there was a line outside. \u00a0It was a chilly night, but there were some heaters on full whack, so we were comfortable. \u00a0Almost too warm even. \u00a0I liked how a member of staff would let us know how long the likely wait was and whether we would make it in before closing time (10pm on Saturday).I expect that we will be back again, particularly as we are often in the Soho/Covent Garden area and it is a winter season treat. \u00a0Highly recommended.",

When we got the menu I was surprised at how small it was, even though they had all the \"essentials.\" I ended up going for the original, and I absolutely LOVED it. This was by far the best ramen I've ever had - the fact that it's the only ramen bowl I've ever completely finished is a testament to that. The noodles were the perfect thickness (thin, which is my personal preference), the toppings/pork were great, and the soup was absolutely phenomenal in its richness and flavor. I will definitely be back.The only downside is that the place is extremely small - I can see why people before me said there was a queue - and so it feels a bit cramped...but honestly the ramen makes it all totally worth it.",

I'm weird about meat on ramen, so this is a huge win for me. Actually, I liked ALL the toppings. I ordered the noodles hard, which kept them nice and firm, as it takes me awhile to eat ramen. I also got the chicken karaage, which was AMAZING!! There was a bit of a line when I arrived, but I was seated within about 10 min and had my food 1 min after I ordered.

    "text": "Yes, I gave into the hype and stood in line for Kanda-Ya. In attempt to be strategic, I went for a late lunch around 14:00. Even staving off my interest and hunger, I did wait around 15 -20 minutes. I will give the staff credit; they treated seating like a competitive game of Tetris. Eating solo? Don't expect to sit at your own table. In fact, you are likely to end up at a four top with a group of three. Who doesn't love communal dining? Who cares, let's get on to the food!* Sake Onigiri - I know, I know, I was there for the Ramen. It was late, I was hungry! It was a moment of weakness. I would describe it as light on salmon. Luckily, I really (really, really) like rice. \u00a0My recommendation, wait for the Ramen. * Original Ramen - I thought the fairest way to judge the restaurant was to order the OG:Let's break it down:o Noodle -The portions were plentiful and the noodles seemed freshly made. \u00a0The most genius part is you select the level of al dente that you would like your noodles cooked to. \u00a0If you don't like your noodles, that's on you. o Broth - Rich and velvety. I like the noodles better, but perhaps you are catching \u00a0on to my love affair with empty carbs.o Pork - Dee-lish! The pork was thinly cut. I find that often thinly cut pork dries out. Not here. The meat was nicely marbled with fat and super moist.o Overall - Super delicious* Moyashi Ramen + Egg - My companion was fancier and went for the Moyashi Ramen plus an egg. \u00a0From what I can tell, the difference between the Moyashi Ramen and the Original Ramen is blanched beansprouts. To me no person would spend an additional \u00a31 for beansprouts; I stood corrected. \u00a0o The egg - My companion was adamant that the egg is the most important part. This egg was apparently very good. I quote \"perhaps even better than Bone Daddy's\". She did not offer to share, which could be interpreted as rude.* Spicy Miso - oh wait... they ran out! I am convinced that a spicy sauce would have taken the broth over the top. * Black garlic sauce - it was good, but you know it was no spicy Miso!",

    "text": "Kanada-Ya is hands down one of the best ramen places ever. The first time I walked by, a breeze carried the scent of freshly made noodles (yes that floury, doughy smell like freshly baked bread, except for noodles) right to me, and I knew that I had to go for a bowl of ramen.I always get the original ramen for around \u00a311. The broth was one of the richest broths I've ever tasted! It tasted like they melted down those pork bones and made it into soup. You can choose the firmness of the noodles, I usually go for the recommended option. The chashu on top is very tender and I like all the other veggies they put on top too. They have this green spicy pickled veggie thing on the side for free and I like to add a spoonful to my ramen for a spicy kick. Sometimes, I split an extra order of noodles with a friend when I finish my noodles but there's still broth left. The chicken karaage is also quite good. It was \u00a36 and they give you around 6 big pieces. It's pretty standard so while it was really good, it's nothing extraordinary compared to other places. My only complaint is that there's always ALWAYS a line when I pass by (up to 2 hours one time) and there's only around a dozen seats in the restaurant. But that how you know it's good right?",

    "text": "Good grief, or yoi kanashimi, since we're talking ramen. Some Yelpers comments are out of line IMO. That said, I'm giving them a 4 for London (If we were in Japan I'd give them a 3). London is an expensive place to run a shop (and yes!, more expensive than in Tokyo IMO) so \u00a310 for a bowl of ramen is sadly reasonable around here. \u00a0 Understand: Kanada-Ya makes Hakata ramen. This is a style that is pork based, has a milky white colour, and is full of delicious, yummy, lip-sticking collagen and fat. And remember, fat does not make you fat, carbs and sugar do. So if you're worried about your waistline why are you even thinking about going out for noodles? Know: Kanada-Ya are specialists at what they do. So no, they don't have a gluten-free vegan ramen and they don't have a bar making green tea lychee 'tinis. If you want that go to Bone Daddies or some silly place like that. I should add that I'm really appreciative of a specialist and focused ramen place opening up in London that has the discipline and confidence in their cooking to just do one thing really well, instead of trying to offer 20-different mediocre dishes (ahem, Shoryu somewhat, or that London ramen atrocity known as Bento Ramen). Kudos to Kanada-Ya for focus. I hope this becomes more common here./// So the Ramen...The Overall Bowl and Broth: It's good. It's not my personal favourite style, but it's a decent bowl. Overall I think it lacks punch, but again, they have their style and they are working hard at it. I'm going to experiment with some topping combinations next time and see what I can do to fix this. Noodles: Mine were perfectly cooked to medium. Just like I asked.Egg: Again, perfectly done. Not as good as Shoryu, but the eggs there are sublime- as good or better than many I've had in Japan.Charshu: Was adequate. I prefer it saltier, but the texture and fat were very good.Overall: This place is a welcome addition to London and will force a lot of people to step up their Ramen game. They will also keep Ippudo - who is about to open across the street - on their toes. While the service was a bit spotty, I'm willing to overlook this for now and chalk it up to them being new.",

I ordered it with a Hanjuku Egg that was very well prepared as well. The ramen broth is a perfect level of saltiness and savoriness. I usually feel like ramen broth leaves me very thirsty, but this broth was not overdone at all. Additionally, the Hanjuku Egg was very well made in the sense that the yolk was not too dry or too runny. I would definitely suggest this place to any ramen lover!ADVICE: There will be a line! Bring a coat because the line is outdoors. There will be a coat rack inside where you can hang up your coat when you're eating. Additionally, be prepared to share a table with someone. The venue is very small so you will end up sharing a table with a stranger.",

There menu is extremely simple. Three choices: original, with bean sprouts, and with pork collar instead of pork belly. Really, they could have done with one menu selection and just had the bean sprouts and pork collar as add-ons. After you choose your ramen you can choose the firmness of the noodles. I ordered mine firm and added an onsen egg. I also ordered a plain onigiri.First, forget the onigiri. The rice is good, but the onigiri itself is forgettable. If you're still hungry after your ramen, just get kaedama and order more noodles.The noodles and broth were both excellent. Noodles had a nice, firm bite and the broth was creamy and frothy, without being overly gelatinous. I really appreciated the 5 thick slices of chasiu. Some other London ramen eateries seem to give one or two paper thin slices of chasiu. This is the type of ramen restaurant that you go to, eat your food, and get out. Very different experience from other London ramen eateries, but also a very nice change.",

    "text": "Always wondered about this place as there is forever a line outside of the door, waiting. Deterred by the line, I never even attempted to find out what type of restaurant that was. That was until one day my Japanese friend invited me to check out a great ramen place. When I research the restaurant online, I realized that we were going to that line outside the door restaurant. By then, I was really looking forward to checking it out, because Ippudo, another great ramen place, is right next door and this ramen shop can still maintain such strong following, they must be doing something right! I got to the restaurant around 1pm and, of course, there was a line outside. Luckily the line moved relatively fast, and within 15 minutes, we got our seat. This is a great place if you have just one or two people going, any size larger than that, you probably should forget about it. The inside of the restaurant is very tiny, and even with very efficient use of space, the whole restaurant can seat about 20 people. No wonder there is always a line outside. The menu is extremely simple: ramen plus choices of toppings and rice balls. I kind of like it. I always have trouble ordering my food when I have too many choices. Here it is simple, order your ramen and how do you like it cooked and add any extra toppings. Go crazy and order a rice ball if you are hungry. I ordered original ramen with Hanjuku eggs. The food came very quickly and, man, that was a good bowl of ramen. The broth was rich and flavorful but not greasy and the ramen was cooked al dente. I swallowed the whole bowl in record time. I felt that I spent more time waiting for my seat than actually eating! However, it is definitely worth the wait.",

When you order you get to order the noodle texture and i like mine regular. The best part of the noodle for me is their egg. Some noodle does not come with egg but you can add the egg with extra \u00a31. Once you finish the noodle you can order extra noodle to add into your remaining soup to eat. I tried it twice now but I felt that it is not as nice. Once the soup get cold you will find that the soup is quite salty and oily.",

I'm very glad we did! We came on a weekday evening at 8PM, and there was still a wait outside. The place isn't huge but they utilized the space very well to maximize the number of people they can seat. We got an order of karaage to share, along with a bowl of ramen for each. They also serve onigiri, but it would've been too much food for us. I told my boyfriend that the ramen was comparable to the ones we had in Japan. And afterwards, I found that they actually do have stores in Japan! Anyways, super solid ramen place. If you're in London and want some authentic ramen, this is the spot!",

We found that the broth maybe lacked a little bit of flavor - but that's probably because we are used to more soja-y or miso-y flavors in France (and most ramen shops propose different broth flavors, which you choose from when ordering your ramen). Note that it is a bit expensive: \u00a310.50 for the most basic version, \u00a313 for the version with more pork of better quality, \u00a32 for an egg, plus 10% service charge - free tap water though.",

For over a year now I've had my eye on it waiting for the hype to die down and a chance to have the famous ramen without the infamous pre-que!.. but today I realised it was never going to happen and I'd have to que like the rest of the world. In fairness it wasn't that long a wait (maybe 20mins)Once inside you see the reason for the line.... It's really small. Comfortable but small. To maximise the seating, you will probably have to share a table. If your a group of 3-4 be prepared for a longer wait and bigger groups..... At your own peril!!!The Ramen... This is what it's all about! The standard product is as good as the reviews make it out great broth, good noodles (choose how they are cooked) and great additional ingredients. Make sure you read what comes as standard though as I didn't and it meant I missed out on the egg (in most other places this comes as standard) I couldn't be bothered to order it after the ramen arrived . Btw, it comes out quick!! We also had a side of carage chicken, not the best but ok.The service is economicical, but you won't be in there long enough to have any complaints... You may line up longer than you spend inside. They also also add 10% service on to the bill.The food is good, the place is nice and the price is reasonable in comparison.... But damn, I hate quing!",

    "text": "Oooh I do like it when a ramen-plan comes together!!Kanada-Ya has been advertising in Japanese newspapers for aaages, so I had the soft opening on my calendar for weeks (and my colleagues and I have been drooling at their twitter feed's pictures of perfect Tonkotsu and eggs...) Today was the soft opening, and although it wasn't perfect, it was still pretty damn good.The Goooooood:- The soup is rich, thick Tonkotsu and is really, really tasty. I thought this was one of the best Tonkotsu soups I've tried in London. - The spicy miso paste was also good. One portion was enough to spice up both of our bowls. Seriously yum.- You can add extra noodles if you run out and are still hungry.- The service was really friendly and sweet, despite the madness of people queuing around the block.The saaaaad:- Tonkotsu was the only option today. I'm not sure if they'll add more broths later, if not, don't bring veggy friends or non-pork-eating friends.- Even though there was only one broth on the menu they ran out of looooads of options. I was planning to have an egg and the black garlic sauce, but they ran out before 7pm. Boo.- They gave us the option of hard or soft ramen. We chose hard, but our ramen were pretty normal (not particularly al dente.) They weren't bad, but they weren't \"hard\". - Hopefully they'll improve the ordering system, as we had to ask for our spicy miso twice, and it took aaages for drinks to appear. We'd finished half our ramen before drinks and miso arrived. Doh!I think I'll have to come back once they have opened properly to see if it gets even better. For now (as the soup was sooooo good) I'd give them 4 stars for flavour and 2 stars for service.* It's 50% off during the soft opening, so do go and try it!* Get there early before they run out of everything!!",

Better than my favourite Bone Daddies.So why am I giving it 3 stars?Well, when you go to Wagamama (yes yes it's a chain but it's a consistent and popular one) you get options for different meat in the ramen, and vegetarian options and such.When you go to Bone Daddie's you also get these options, and you also have gluten free noodles if you so desire or require.When you go to Kanada-Ya you spend ages queuing but all you can have is pork ramen. There isn't even a vegetarian option. Now this doesn't hugely bother me, but it does mean that I simply cannot go to this place when I am with a significant proportion of my friends who do not eat pork.The friend who introduced me to this place told me that ramen is only supposed to come in pork varieties. But I guess she hasn't actually been to Japan, or she'd know this just isn't true.So yeah, if you want a pork based Ramen, you cannot beat this place. It is awesome. But if you don't want pork, go somewhere else. I recommend Bone Daddies.",

    "text": "There are a few things I am obsessed about, and Ramen is definitely one of them. I have been obsessed with Tonkotsu ramen since trying it at Bone Daddies 2 years ago, and fed off it in Japan last year. And truthfully, the battle for best Tonkotsu in London is VERY TIGHT between Bone Daddies and Kanada-ya - and based on my latest experience with both... I'm leaning more towards Kanada-ya. YES, yes. It was THAT good. The problem with the West End is that the cool and funky places are booked up like crazy, so it's always a challenge having an impromptu meal before enjoying a good show.Don't let yourself be put off by the queue in front of Kanada-ya - and expect one, there will always be one. The venue is tiny, but the the turnaround is pretty quick and you won't have to wait too long (plus, as I said: worth it) As I mentioned, the venue is tiny and built in typical Japanese fashion. It's not made for you to come and spend hours with friends chatting, it's made for you to come, sit your bum and eat delicious ramen. The menu is very short, meaning you get served amazing food in a record time. Don't be too shy, you'll probably be sitting on a communal table with other people enjoying their deliciousness. And now the food. For those I've lost, Tonkotsu is a creamy pork broth based ramen. And broth is what makes the ramen. And that brother was out of this world. I added the garlic sauce as an extra (which really worked) and extra egg - soft boiled eggs are a classic, you can't have a ramen without one. Trust me. Price-wise, perfect value. You will be paying less than \u00a315 per person for a meal and drink. Soo... What are you waiting for? (Also, please let me come with you?)",

And there was no super awesome cocktail menu either.First impressions were great - 98% Japanese diners. Felt like I was in Tokyo again.One neat aspect of this 24-seater restaurant is the way they handle their queue of customers. There are two benches outside of the restaurant, positioned end-to-end to create one long bench. If you see people sitting on the bench, then there is a queue, so follow these guidelines to join and \"work\" the queue: People seated on the bench closest to the door are at the front of the queue and people seated furthest away from the door are at the end of queue. As people from the front of the queue are seated in the restaurant, everyone on the bench slides down toward the door. Don't bother asking the hostess for available tables, just get in the queue.Secondary impressions were good - diners seemed to be enjoying themselves slurping their bowls and such.Tertiary impressions were just OK - I found \u00a311.50 for a bowl of Moyashi Ramen a bit too expensive. On a good day, the bowl was worth \u00a38. Why? The lack of pork. There were three small and thin slices, possibly an ounce in total weight. A shame, really.The broth was good and the noodles were cooked perfectly (forgo ordering Kaedama (an extra portion of noodles) as you likely won't need any. I found there to be too many noodles in my bowl for my liking. There were a few condiments on the table, none of which included fresh garlic which was a huge disappointment. I've never eaten ramen without fresh garlic and loads of it.Service was prompt and attentive, our server even kindly provided me with a fork so I didn't have to whip out my BYOF as I did whilst eating my way through Japan.Overall, just OK ramen that overpriced.",

It tasted really good and my meal was completed with the freshness of sour plum sushi. Definitely one of the best ramen spots in london.",

I went there with the intent of having a nice bowl of ramen, but they were out of char siu, which doesn't make much sense for a ramen house since char siu is such an integral part of the dish in general. Every single one of their bowls contains char siu, and the Yelp photos suggest hearty portions, and to not have it available is like saying they're out of ramen broth or noodles, hence my reasoning for just ordering a few sides at that time.When time came to pay the bill, I was told by the staff that if I want to ever dine there again, I have to order ramen. Okay, that makes sense, and I came with the intent of having ramen but decided against it since I would be paying full-price for a meal that lacked an integral part of its essence: the thick slices of char siu. So it was a little off-putting to be blatantly told this. Next time, I'll probably opt for a different ramen joint in the area with better prepared karaage and one that would have char siu in stock.",

The different flavors you get with tonkotsu x, yuzu and gekikara broths are so satisfying in their own ways. Tonkotsu x has a nice creamy taste and not too rich like some other places. I was able to finish the broth. Yuzu has that extra kick in it with a slight citrus (note: not lemon or lime.) More of a tart, pepper zesty taste. It cuts through the richness of the tonkotsu broth. Perfect for me. My fianc\u00e9 had the gekikara and wow. The minced beef adds a deeper taste of beef to the broth. I think I have to get it the next time I go. I was able to come here twice on my trip. First time I had tonkotsu x and fianc\u00e9 had yuzu. Second time I had yuzu and he had gekikara. Next time I'll have gekikara and he will have..??? :) probably spicy miso! \u00a0Also I'm usually not a fan of chicken karaage. Actually I don't like it at all. BUT I tried it and it is better than most other ones I've tried. Not oily and very crunchy. Their onigiri also comes out hot! Very homey in the winter time.",

Because a line started to form before they opened so I walked over and started speaking to the locals and they said by far Kanada-Ya was better and I have to agree. This broth is so rich.. The broth is simmered with pork bones for 18 hours and you can really tell. I ordered the classic and just added eggs which were perfectly cooked, you know what im talking about, that dark yellow runny yolk in the center mmmm. It was perfect for the chilly 40 degree weather in London. Im a westerner I use fahrenheit so excuse me lol. I also got a side of spicy miso and added a little to spice it up!

Having read a lot about this restaurant I wasn't sure what to expect and whether it would be the real deal or just a massively overhyped tourist-trap. Now that I've been there, I do believe the hype.The first thing that caught my attention was the line in front of the restaurant, which is perfectly normal in Japan but rare to come across in the West. Like in Japan, you are handed the menu in advance so you can already decide on what you want before getting a seat as the line moves rather quickly. We opted for a classic Tonkotsu Ramen, a spicy Yuzu Tonkotsu and some Karaage (fried chicken) as a side.I wasn't sure what to expect from the Yuzu Tonkotsu but it was absolutely delicious. The acidity added by the Yuzu was just right, combined with a hint of spiciness it nicely balanced out the fatty broth, adding a little freshness to an otherwise hearty and earthy dish. While the soups were stellar, what really stole the show was the Karaage. Coming with Yuzu-flavored mayo and a slightly spicy batter, the fried chicken was modeled after the flavor profile of the spicy Tonkotsu, which worked great. The meat was super juicy, and perfectly cooked through while the spices didn't distract too much from the chicken itself. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in my life.If you like Ramen and you're in London, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.",

    "text": "Super tiny ramen shop located right across the street from Ippudo and likely to have a queue during peak lunch and dinner hours. I came here at 1:30-2:00 pm on a weekday by myself and didn't have to wait which was awesome.It's easy to make a decision on what to order since they don't have a very extensive menu. They make a few things very well. They serve some karage, some other appetizers, and 4-5 types of ramen. I got the Tonkatsu ramen, added some spicy miso paste (which came in a spoon so you could control how much you wanted to add), and added an egg. I like that you can specify the texture of the noodles (hard, medium, or soft).The broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles were perfectly al dente, and it was certainly one of the better bowls of ramen that I've had. But having just eaten at Ippudo in NY the week before, I just preferred Ippudo a touch more. I'd wait for this ramen again for ~30 min, but not sure I'd wait 1+ hour for this. Perfect for a grey, cold, blustery day. My total for the ramen, spicy miso paste, and egg was \u00a316 so it's not exactly cheap, and it seemed to be smaller than the Ippudo NY ramen I had.Come solo or with only one other person, and be prepared to eat communally at the bar or a long table. The space is small and fits only ~30 people, so if you have a party of 4+, go elsewhere!",

    "text": "We continued our venture of Ramen in central London and we went to their original branch.The menu is as small as the restaurant, with a choice of only 4 types of ramen. As we went as a party of 4, we got to order all of them to try.Original Ramen (\u00a310.50) - The Original Ramen at Kanada-Ya forms the basis to all their ramens and what you see is what you get! A generous portion of ramen noodles served with an 18-hour pork bone broth, topped with slices of chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori (seaweed) and spring onion. The menu also says there's a secret sauce in this, not sure what it was, but it definitely tasted great! The broth was intense and full of flavour. The slices of chashu pork were melt-in-your-mouth tender. All the different toppings not only made the bowl of ramen pretty, they also added to the overall flavour and texture. If you like the simple things in life, then you won't go wrong with this Original!Moyashi Ramen (\u00a311.50) - the Original Ramen, topped with steamed beansprouts. This is one for those of you that like a bit of veg in your ramen. The steamed beansprouts were just cooked, so they still had a bit of crunch to them.Chashu-Men (\u00a313.00) - the Original Ramen, but instead of the pork belly slices, you get massive pork collar slices. The pork collar had just the right amount of fat, evenly distributed across the meat. Which means it was super tender, but also had a bit of bite to it.Gekikara Ramen (\u00a313.00) - Served with spicy 'tan tan' style minced pork and pork belly chashu. This is perfect for those that like a bit of a kick in their ramen. As you can see, it's pork mince, with pork belly slices, in a pork bone broth. So this is pretty porky! The spiciness isn't too overpowering, so you can still taste all the different levels of flavours from the ramen.We also had a side dish of Karaage (\u00a36.50) - which were deep fried chunks of chicken, served with creamy Japanese mayonnaise. These were super crispy and moist. The seasoning was in the coating and on the chicken itself. So we could tell they were freshly cooked for us. Extremely yummy and a must try if you come to Kanada-Ya. We think they would've tasted even better if they were spicy tough.Although the ramen was nice, the broth could've been more intense. We also felt that the ramen needed the additional toppings of the pickles, garlic and sesame to really bring it to life.",

I found myself as a bit of a ramen fanatic this passed year... Trying all the varying ramens in London (I have a lot under my list now!).I almost always for go the Tonkotsu or Chashu Men Ramen. The Chashu comes with more pork than the Tonkotsu, but is slightly more expensive. The taste of both as fantastic. Always get Hanjuku Egg to accompany your ramen, the way Kanada-Ya boils these eggs is amazing.To accompany this incredibly tasty ramen I always have a Calipis to drink, and Salmon Onigiri and Karaage as sides. Seriously, there is no better ramen in London. You MUST come here.",

    "text": "Dubbed one of London's top ramen shops, I can only think of one word to describe Kanada-Ya: underwhelming. Perhaps it is London's pre-eminent ramen shop with lines flying out the door. Across, you'll find Ippudo, a world-renowned ramen chain that has hours-long waits in its NYC shops, sitting slightly emptier. Has Kanada-Ya taken the throne away from them in London? Maybe.I waited about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. It is a very small, quaint corner restaurant that can fit less than 40 people. As I was approaching the from across the street, I could already smell the heavy truffle aroma from their popular Truffle Ramen from the swinging door. The patrons leaving, too, smelled like truffles as they dashed past me. Being a truffle fanatic, I was so pumped for the Truffle Ramen.I'm no ramen expert but this was far from the best ramen I've ever had. You might like this if you like light broths, but it's not creamy at all. The truffle oil felt more like it was there for the smell, and maybe some flavor. The pork was a bit on the dry side and took me awhile to get through. For the most expensive ramen on the menu (\u00a314), I wish they'd included a Hanjuku egg or something because it felt...plain. Kanada-Ya is definitely overhyped. I can't speak for Ippudo in London, but I try to avoid it altogether like a plague since it's overhyped in NYC. London doesn't seem to have a very competitive ramen scene and that's sorta sad, given how many trendy Japanese restaurants there are in the area, I might as well have just gone to Japan Centre.",

The two redeeming factors were the meat and the char siu don. The meat was absolutely amazing; so soft like I was eating clouds. It was juicy and OMG my mouth is now watering just thinking about it. The char siu don (using the same meat) was equally as good. As weird as this sounds, if I go back in the future, it would definitely be to just crush three of those char siu dons.",

Be prepared to wait in line (no wait list to sign up). There's a bench outside and they provide small cups of tea sometimes while you wait. The turnover is quite fast so don't be too intimated by the amount of people. The food comes out ridiculously fast. I got the only in London ramen and my husband got the truffle. The ramen is pretty bare bones in terms of toppings. If you want anything like an egg or garlic oil it's extra. You can pick your noodle toughness which is nice. Portion is just right so you can order something else. The broth is really thick and flavorful. I personally enjoyed the charsu and I normally don't. \u00a0Karaage was pretty good. 4 pounds for three decent sized pieces. Nice crispy outside and good sauce. Not the best I've had but it was pretty good. If I was a local I would come back but not often given how expensive it is.",

    "text": "Great ramen option in London. We were swayed by seeing the line when we were initially planning to go to Ippudo across the street. The line moves pretty fast. Be ready with what you want to order before you get inside. You could always grab a beer at the convenience store next store and have it while you wait. Ordered the spicy yuzu which actually had a good amount of heat with the soft boiled egg which you must add to any ramen you get. I would even budget more stomach room for more eggs! Also ordered the chasu with garlic oil and egg. Both were amazing with hard noodles. The noodles are thinner than most ramen places. The chicken katsu was the perfect amount of salty and crunchy. Definitely filled my ramen craving. Also pretty large portions so be sure to budget stomach room.",

    "text": "Nothing special, and I still needed to wait in line for 30 minutes.I hail from San Francisco where we have a very competitive ramen scene. After eating at Kanada-Ya, I have to say that if this is the best that London has to offer, I feel really bad for people who live in London. I decided to come to Kanada-Ya at the last moment, so when I got there about 15 minutes after they opened, there was already a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. I waited about 20-25 minutes and was allowed inside. Because we were given menus while waiting in line, before I even sat down, I placed an order for the tonkatsu X ramen with noodles cooked hard, umeboshi onigiri and the chicken karaage. I figured that if I was only to come once, I was going to order everything I wanted to try. The food came out relatively quickly. The chicken karaage came out first and was the highlight of the meal (that's sad considering that the ramen is supposed to be the highlight). It was crispy, very well seasoned, and the dipping mayo was very good. I highly recommend you order this when you are here. It was a reasonable portion for the price. The ramen came next. I prefer the thicker ramen noodles, and these were the thin kind. The broth didn't taste very special. They claim that this broth takes a really long time to develop, etc., but it really doesn't taste like 20 hour (or however long) broth. There were no complex flavors that you would come to expect from a broth that took so long to make. The char siu was pretty good, but when I eat ramen, I expect the broth to be the highlight. I don't recommend the umeboshi onigiri. I grew up eating umeboshi and they give you the large, cheap, sour kind, not the expensive honey somewhat sweet and sour kind of umeboshi. Sure they were big, but definitely not worth the price. But honestly, what did I expect from a place that specializes in ramen.If there is a line for this joint, I recommend going to the Ippudo across the street with no line. There is no reason for you to stand outside in the freezing cold (if it's winter) for 20-30 minutes to eat a bowl of subpar ramen. My friend did try this place out before me, and suggested I not go because this was nothing special, but I didn't listen to him because I just love ramen.",

    "text": "After living in the Netherlands for a few months, I was craving ramen like no other. I tried to get it in Switzerland (major mistake, their ramen was from the instant ramen packages from the supermarket) and then tried it again in the Netherlands for brunch (also mistake, the noodles were soggy and the broth/meat had no flavor). So when we were going to London for a weekend, I decided that ramen would be our first meal. Kanada-Ya doesn't take reservations, so we got there around 7:45 and there were about 6 people waiting outside the store. We got seated in about 20 minutes which was much better than I expected. I got the truffle ramen and my boyfriend got the Tonkotsu-X, and we split a chicken karaage. This was too much food for the both of us but I really liked the chicken (not overly fried or oily). My ramen was good, but not amazing. I love truffle but I actually didn't really like it in my ramen, but the Tonkotsu-X was great. The ramen also doesn't come with an egg so make sure to add one if you want! They recommend you get the hard noodles which were perfect to me. Overall, great ramen spot in London.",

    "text": "Quite a delicious ramen place. From the reviews, I guess this must be one of the best ramen houses in London. I've been to ramen places around the world from Tokyo to San Francisco, Kanada-Ya is probably somewhere in the middle on my list of great ramen places (still pretty good!)The seating inside is quite tight but that's pretty typical of ramen places. The broth they use is a classic and you can tell that they brew it for over 10 hours with pork. I absolutely love this style of heavy broth, it gives the ramen a richness that is quite unique compared to other styles of noodles. The chasu is decent but nothing that floored me.All in all, a decent place for a bowl noodles. It is quite expensive but that's expected in the heart of London. If you need ramen in London, this is probably the place to be (as evidenced by the rave reviews and long lines).",

Even though their speciality is added truffle oil, I find the truffle oil smell a bit too thick and strong in noodle soup or with the edamame beans. My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu x with 'hard' noodles (yes, you can customise your noodle!). No matter how many times I dine at Kanadaya, I can't get enough of their noodles and I will always be back!",

I ended up going for and would highly recommend the spicy ramen which didn't overpower the broth and topped it off with an extra egg which was still lovely and runny. (Visit - 18/05/2015 Lunch)",

    "text": "People are talking about this restaurant and I can see a long queue waiting outside so I could not wait to try their Ramen. The menu is quite simple with only 3 items priced 10, 11 and 13. I order original tonkotsu ramen cost \u00a310 without service charge which is a good price for a bowl of Ramen. However the bowl is so small and I literally can count 3 small pieces of pork. The soup is nice but I did not get it much as well as their noodle in such a small bowl. I complaint about this and the waiter said that's how everyone get it in here !!! To compare with other Ramen restaurant in soho, i do not think I will come back here as I will have better choices not too far away. And there is a new big Ramen restaurant coming soon just opposite this restaurant so I am waiting to see how long the queue will last.",

From far and wide,O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee. God, \u00a0thine ramen's garlicky glory!O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee.O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee.Yeah.Where to start...Kanada-Ya is one of the newest ramen additions to London. \u00a0It's awesome. \u00a0Even though I've had to wait an hour for my ramen on one occasion, it's still awesome (beware, there are queues at lunchtime too).Kanada-Ya is the David to Ippudo's Goliath bearing down on it from across the street in the premises formerly containing Damson Cafe. \u00a0There's not a lot of seating (maybe room for 25-30 people at a time?) and is perpetually steamy, thanks to the small soup area (to call it an exposition kitchen would be generous, it's pretty dinky).Anyhow. \u00a0Kanada-Ya does very few things - tonkotsu ramen and onigiri (and ramune, for those of you into that sort of thing) - but it does them extremely well. \u00a0My standard order there is the chashu men (tonkotsu with the bowl rim lined with pork, fungus, and nori) with extra black garlic oil (highly recommended for all orders) and a hanjuku egg - it's a shame the egg doesn't come as standard, but never mind. \u00a0Also, you get to choose your noodle hardness (I go for extra hard just like my...abs) which is tripleplusgood: the noodles here are the thin Hakata-type - whilst I generally prefer thicker noodles, getting to choose noodle hardness really puts Kanada-ya up in my estimation. \u00a0The broth is delicious - I've been mulling it over, but I think the broth flavour just about pips Bone Daddies (there, I said it). \u00a0Simply put, one of the best bowls of ramen I've had - whilst I haven't been to Ippudo in London, I have been to a branch in Kuala Lumpur and Kanada-ya's is far superior.Yes, the service is pretty haphazard. \u00a0But for me the ramen erases any bad feeling I may have about the place; besides, it's not like the staff are rude - it's more a case of inefficiency and hopefully will improve over time.We're really spoiled for ramen in London. \u00a0Really spoiled. \u00a0It's an awesome time to be here.",

    "text": "The first time I came here, there was a queue so I left. I came here for the second time and thank God there was no queue. But the place was still pretty packed and I was seated at the last available spot at a communal table. The service was very attentive and my food came fairly quickly. I ordered the Chashu Men and it was quite delicious. The broth is flavorful as expected, but I do find the frothiness a bit strange... I expected the chashu collar to be a bit more marbled and felt that it was bit too sweet for my taste. Maybe I should have opted for the pork belly instead. The noodles were good. And the sous vide eggs... ARE TO DIE FOR. It's perfection in that aspect compared to Bone Daddies and Shoryu in my opinion. Great place!",
