    "text": "Wow. Just wow.I happened to see Bleecker St. Burger at the Food Festival at Southbank Centre over the bank holiday weekend. We were here for lunch, and the other half and I decided to split a burger. We ordered a blue burger because we're both blue cheese fiends. So the burger. It's not a fancy bun. You're not going to get the new Brioche buns that are popular these days. You get a seeded bun that's perfectly toasted. The other half doesn't like tomatoes, so I asked if it came with tomatoes. It doesn't. The burgers are simple. Bun, lettuce, sauce and burger. (Apparently the double cheeseburgers come with onion which I must try someday). Easy.The sign said burgers are cooked medium rare unless you order something else. Perfect. Why would anyone eat something that wasn't cooked medium rare? They also serve regular fries or sweet potato fries (or a combo) which we didn't get this time.But the burger. The burger was delicious. We devoured it and I kind of wish we ordered one each. It was that good. The burger was perfectly juicy and the blue cheese went so well with it. It was cooked perfectly. AND the best part of all is it left your mouth with that salty burger feeling that many places in the UK don't have. I don't know how to describe it, but a lot of burgers in the US leave a certain taste in your mouth when you're done, and it was so nice to have that taste again.This is likely to be the best burger I've had in London. I will find them sometime and eat them again. And i will enjoy them.Thanks Bleecker St. Burger for bringing American Style burgers to London. It's like that Eddie From Ohio song: 'Step around the corner from Bleecker to Broadway / A girl sings out at the top of her lungs / \"If you can make it here then you can make it, / La la la la la la La\"'You've made it.UPDATE: I've now also had the double cheese burger (amazing) and the angry fries. Get the angry fries. Blue cheese and buffalo sauce on fries. Fantastic.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Bleecker St Burger and learned that it would be at a nearby market on a particularly hungover Sunday - perfect storm! I dragged my partner and a friend to test it with me. I really love a good burger, but this did not hit the spot for me. I went for the double because go big or go home, right? Maybe I didn't love the mix of meat, or maybe it was a bad day for the burger. I really don't know. It was good, for sure, but doesn't match up against other favorites in London (oh hai, Dirty Burger, you filthy mistress). I'd choose DB, Honest Burger, or any of the MeatMarket family over it, if you're looking for a down and dirty cheap burger. The fries were tasty, but the burger was filling enough that you don't need them. I'd definitely go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I feel tremendous guilt writing this because I want to love ALL burgers. Really, I do.Also, what does NYC-style burgers mean? Even within NYC, there is such a huge range of what burgers taste like, I don't think it's a style you can really pinpoint.",

You can tell that the person responsible for all of the burger goodness coming from Bleeker knows what their doing. The meat is cooked perfectly, never over done. The buns are light, fluffy and buttery and helps to create the perfect meat to bread ratio. The burger sauce has plenty of flavour to it and the veggies are fresh. I think it's also important to mention the angry fries that are served here--one of a kind. I'm a big fan of buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese, it's a fantastic combination (and reminds me a lot of home). The fries themselves were cut thin, which I personally like. Overall I would recommend this spot, especially to all my fellow foodies out there.",

    "text": "Bleecker St is not, as I discovered, named after a street in South Africa. \u00a0The first time I came here a couple of years ago, I thought they were good burgers although I wasn't wowed by them - solid upmarket McDs-style, but still tasty. \u00a0Then came National Burger Day in 2013 where they whipped up a quadruple decker burger for us which was utterly obscene in the most delicious, drippy way possible. \u00a0I went to their stand in Kerb Clubhouse the other day and the quality is still great: I had a double blue cheese burger which had outstanding flavour...the patty is one of the best ones you'll find in town and the meat flavour rivals that of Patty & Bun. \u00a0The blue cheese goes so well in these burgers too, I find it night on impossible not to shove the whole thing into my gaping maw (cue salivation). \u00a0The meat just melts too - medium rare (a touch on the rare side, so just right for me) and packed with that delicious, delicious fat. \u00a0I'm going to pay for this in my old age, kids.So why not 5*s? \u00a0Hmm. \u00a0The burgers here aren't huge (and may have shrunk of late) - even the double burgers are roughly the same size as an Honest Burger. \u00a0Perhaps everything will forever look small in comparison to the aforementioned Death Tower....I'm not the sort of person who'll harp on about price and I appreciate good quality in moderate portions - I don't demand to be disgustingly stuffed to the point where all I can taste for the next 6 hours is burger sauce and raw onions; that said, it isn't amaaaazing value - for a double blue with chips it came to \u00a310.50 which, whilst not horrible (on par with Honest/P&B et al), it's still expensive for a street food place. \u00a0So there's that. \u00a0Still, I highly recommend that you go here as it really is one of the better burgers in London. \u00a0I'm still salivating quite a lot just thinking about it, so I think it's safe for you to take my drooly, slobbery word for it.",

    "text": "While they don't have the hype that perhaps Mother Flipper or Lucky Chip have, this burger truck has its own thing going on. They claim to be 'NY style burgers', but I've spent a lot of time in NYC and really don't know what that means (now, if they said hot dog, I'd know what that meant...). I have had their burgers twice, once at Eat Street and once at the Red Market. Now, don't take this the wrong way, but these burgers taste a lot like McDonald's... except, like, organic and not fast food (or MAYBE even In and Out). But the sesame seed bun, thinnish patty, American cheese, and mysterious orangish special sauce... all rather harken to upscale, free-range Micky D's. And let's be honest, McDonalds didn't become a bajillion dollar corporation by not being delicious, so while this may sound like a yuppie insult, I actually mean it as a complement. The only issue is that they are not McDonald's priced. Well, not that they should be, but \u00a36 is a lot for a smallish burger when I, a not entirely large girl, could probably easily eat two in one sitting. One was simply not enough to satisfy my craving. Or maybe I am just a fatso. But regardless, I'd say it was worth, size wise, like \u00a34.50 - 5.00 max. But I also realize that happy cows are costly. Oh, and I also stole some fries off my eating partner, and those were really good too.",

    "text": "I am pleased to report success with truck-stalking since arriving in London, having tried Bleecker Street Burger a few weeks back. Specialising in 'New York Style' burgers and fries, I was pretty much sold, and able to drag a few American friends along. Who better to judge the American food truck than the new ex-pats? We tucked in at Camden Town Brewery and did the good beer n' burgers thing.The first thing worth mentioning is this Special Sauce that Bleecker Street uses. I'm not sure the recipe, feeling a bit presumptuous in asking, but is fabulous. Being condiment-happy, I also added ketchup to my burger, and the two made an excellent pair. The burger itself was juicy and piping hot--as it should be given I watched it being cooked! The standard cooking style at Bleecker Street is Medium, which is a bit pinker than my preferred, but I trust my chefs to cook their meat properly, and Bleecker Street knows Medium is a happy middle ground for burger lovers, as well as for the meat. Finally, the sesame seed buns are perfectly toasted to give a nice texture to compliment tender meat and crunchy lettuce.The french fries were delectable, on par with Five Guys back in the States. I had originally hoped for sweet potato fries (you seriously can't find those in this city), but apparently those are quite popular. I was still happy to dig into a bag of fries too hot to eat. If I could call up the best description of Bleecker Street's fries, it's walking on the boardwalk at Ocean City, Maryland with fresh local fries. Everyone says the McDonalds fries taste like home, but I have to say that Bleecker Street pulls up a bit more meaningful home-memory for me. Also, they are so totally made for sharing, so order one for the table.The prices of Bleecker Street just recently changed, particularly the cheeseburger is now \u00a34.50 down from the roughly \u00a36.50 I think I remember paying. This is a much better price, and I'd actually be interested in seeing the double cheeseburger come down just a bit (not that I can ever eat one in my life), and it would be great to see a meal-deal option. At places like Camden Town Brewery, most people won't order a drink, but given it's a can of soda, the right pricing structure will encourage people to buy more.Overall, I'm totally pleased for many reasons. First: a proper food truck. This is the way we do back home. Second: a great American food truck. There's no mucking about; this is bad-for-your-waistline, great-for-your-hangover American burgers and fries (though I will say I'm confident the ingredients used are as healthy as can be; these Brits are pretty nutters about healthy food). Made by an American, and proudly sporting a Red Sox hat while selling New York style burgers. Can't really go wrong with that.",

Their burgers are some of the best out there. Imagine the nicest meat you've ever had, ground up, cooked medium-rare, then sandwiched between an unobtrusive sesame bun... That's basically what Bleecker burger does. I love that their burgers aren't fussy or complicated; it lets you really enjoy the meat, which is delicious. I tend to go for their cheeseburger, with lettuce and extra onions! (At some point, I'm going to try the double burger, which looks enormous...) As for the price, \u00a34.50 for a cheeseburger makes it one of the cheapest \u00a0high-quality burgers in London. As you'd expect, they also sell fries.

    "text": "Bleecker St Burger is a relatively new food truck on the London street food scene. Started by a lovely lady from New York (although for some reason I think she was a Red Sox fan...), it offers up a simple menu of a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheese burger done the NYC style. Sides include regular or sweet potato fries and you can get a few sodas to wash it all down. They source the meat from a very particular butcher down in south London and prepare the patties by hand on site. I know this for a fact as she was making them one late Friday morning in preparation for the lunch rush while I sat there munching on the first burger of the day and chatting about the challenges of being a street food vendor. The hamburger and cheeseburger are undoubtedly good, but what really stands out is the double cheeseburger. Two thick juicy patties of prime A beef coarsely ground and carefully shaped by hand are sandwiched by gooey melted cheese and a encased in a soft white bun. The meat melts in your mouth but provides just enough resistance to add a layer a texture to each bite and balance the creaminess of the cheese. I'm a demi-brioche man normally, but I was quite impressed with how well the bun held together despite the amount of meat juice that was leaking out of my burger. This isn't a healthy meal by any means but it never pretended to be. Instead, it goes for that glorious impact of artery clogging goodness and it achieves it with flying colors. The one hold up is that for the price (fairly steep at around \u00a38 I think), there are better options on Eat St but sometimes you just want that large heart stopping bite of simple awesomeness and Bleecker St hits all the right notes for that. They keep it simple which means you get a quality product each time and that's something far too few of their burger slinging competitors can claim.I'm knocking them down a star because they didn't have any fries ready for another 30 mins which was disappointing so I've got to hold off on that until I can try it for a full experience. Ah screw it, it was a very tasty burger so take that 4th star!",

I tried the cheeseburger and it was really salty (and this coming from an American who LOVES her salt) and honestly not anything special!

Check their Twitter to find where they are on a given day - @bleeckerburger. Before even locating the truck, I could smell the tasty burgers being cooked. Arriving at the friendly counter, I asked which burger to order and was informed the double was an award-winning creation. Waiting in anticipation as my burger was cooked, I pondered what to top such a burger with. I noted that the condiments were outside the truck, which places burger destiny in your own hands (luckily, I think we all know what we like). Upon receiving the burger, I took a quick peek and noticed that it looked like a Classic American backyard grill burger. I grabbed the mayo, mustard, and ketchup to put a generous topping of each on top. I found a seat in the park and bit into this beautiful burger... making sure to keep it away from my clothes (since it was dripping with flavor). Melted cheese, juicy beef, sweet, salty, and creamy condiments... and a pillowy bun that gives any London burger a run for its money. My burger disappeared within only a few minutes, and so did my napkins trying to battle this multi-napkin affair. A food truck that makes a burger better than most steakhouses. Compared to my other top burgers Bleecker easily takes them on, but personal preference steps into the equation. I love pickled or caramelized onions, bacon, or a hint of or spicy/smoky flavor. As a result, Bleecker is not my #1 in London, but it's darn close.",

My husband and I went to London to celebrate a decade together as a couple and being the burger lovers that we are we decided to find the best burgers in Londontown! And did we!!! :) The toasted bun was light as a feather, yet so tasty and was the perfect match to the perfect beef patties. I asked for mine to be cooked to \"well done\", instead of \"medium rare\" which they recommend, and that was not a problem at all! We had a laugh about it and she said \"that's ok, babysteps. Next time you'll have \"medium well\" and after that you're at \"medium rare!!\"She was really sweet about it! My husband and I ordered cheeseburgers and fries and sweet potatoe fries. Everything was SOOO delicious! My cheeseburger was so juicy even when cooked to \"well done\" and the cheese, lettuce and dressing made it complete! This will definitely be a must-go-to place when we visit London next time. If you want to eat the best burger in your life - this is where you need to go!!!",

And so that's what we did last weekend.Is it the best burger in town? It's hard to decide ... Without any doubt it's worth every penny. Prices are cheaper than other (gourmet) burger places, but you have to sit outside for it. The meat is ridiculously fatty and juicy. The fat simply drips down your fingers while eating and there is no escaping from it. Please bring your grandmother. It's amazing how rich the flavour of a burger can be with so little. There are barely any toppings and therefore with just a patty, bun, bacon and cheese they are able to provide you with an orgasm in your mouth ... (wrong metaphor?.. CORRECT metaphor!!) We took the Angry Fries to share and they were amazing. I never before had fries delivered with a hot sauce and blue cheese. But it's a great balanced and flavoured combination.With so many burger places in London whom each deliver their own touch, it's hard to make the opening claim; but if you happen to be in Shoreditch and up for a burger, I do strongly recommend you check these guys out.",

    "text": "As a Londoner, the search for the perfect burger is never far from my mind. Would I ever find the burger which was juicy, flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth, slightly fatty AND with good chips? Well, Bleecker St. Burger ticks all these boxes. With a big tick. Speedy service, but not so fast it makes you think the burgers have been sitting there for ages waiting for you to come along. Burgers are sold medium rare as standard, just the way they should be with fatty juices and cheesy goodness. Happy to cook well-done too. Burgers are served with raw white onion and no other salad, which wouldn't have been my personal choice but actually ended up perfect. I had to force myself to enjoy the burger and savour it, admire it even, not wolf it down in 10 seconds like I wanted to. The chips are down right perfect, super crispy and moreish. The combination of my preferred choice skinny fries with the texture of skin-on fries. Also tried the Iced-tea lemonade, slightly bitter tea flavour with tangy lemon and plenty of fine bubbles. Really liked the small touches too, sauces on all tables, decent mayo, not the cheap nasty stuff, plenty of napkins available, bags for take-away and burgers served on plates, not in foil. My only criticism? Would like a teensy touch more seasoning on the meat patties, but that's just personal and wet wipes would be a great addition as its a juicy eating process; not a bad thing at all you understand! Looking forward to going back to try the bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. Wonderful work Bleecker St.!",

    "text": "I finally got to try the Bleecker St. burger at Brooklyn Feast in Dalston a boy was it worth the wait.I should now add that this burger was the primary reason for my presence at Street Feast. Now there was a bit of a discussion on Twitter which involved Zan from Bleecker, Joel (@JAMspoon86) and myself where I jokingly said I fancied a triple cheeseburger for my birthday. Zan being Zan said she would be more than happy to give me the chance to sample an off the menu burger. Being a man of my word I went for it! Rolled up to the busiest food truck at Feast and ordered the Triple Cheese Bleecker Burger. A big cheer erupted behind the counter, \"You must be the birthday boy Dan!\". Off they went to create what Joel and I jokingly named the 'BFD Triple Bleecker Burger', my mouth was watering at the very prospect.The group I was with wanted to try the fries too, so I ordered the sweet potato fries and the 'Angry' fries. The angry fries were coated in some sort of hot sauce, maybe Tabasco or something like that, they really were delicious, and angry! Back to the burger; Zan and her team constructed the beast and handed it to me wishing me a \"Happy Birthday, this one is on us\" a really nice touch I thought, thank you guys. I walked around for bit to find a quiet spot so I could have my moment with my triple. It was going to get messy.I opened up the lid and it hit me, the smell of New York, that's right, it reminded me of being in New York and sampling my first burger in the States. The smell of the Bleecker burger was meaty, really, really, meaty. I just about managed to pick it up without losing the contents and sunk my big fat mouth into the burger. Wow, I was in a zone. My wife was trying to bring me back to reality, \"Dan... Dan... what's it like?! Dan? DAN!!!\", but I couldn't even hear her, I was slipping into a burger coma, a burcoma. The meat was amazing; meat to fat ratio was spot on, and despite all the juice coming from the burger, the bun held together superbly. I was enjoying the burger so much, and still in my burcoma, so I didn't take much notice what else was in there, I recall some lettuce, onion and a tangy sauce, but it all played second fiddle to three amazingly cooked patties. I demolished it with ease, and I'd probably go as far as saying it's the best burger I have had in London, bold statement I know.",

A bit too greasy for my taste. Tried the double cheeseburger and the signature black bleecker - the second one comes with an interesting twist :)Also tried the mixed fries and the spicy \"angry fries\" with cheese sauce - both good although still bit too greasy. I give top marks because it advertises as a street burger and invthat category it rocks!",

    "text": "Items ordered: Double Cheeseburger with bacon, angry fries and regular fires, black and white shake.The burger: Heavenly. Strong beef flavor, no nibs or gristle, cooked with a soft pink center. The bacon was good, and the onions nearly unnoticed. As I'm normally not a fan of raw onions, I was skeptical, but the decision to leave the burger unchanged proved a good decision. The bacon was good, nothing overly special, but plenty in portion size. I cannot stress how good this burger was in whole, and this is coming from a Los Angeles based burger snob who goes on burger tours. Hot, fresh, juicy, quality, not overcooked (like seemingly every UK burger I had). I'll make it a point to go for every visit to London. This is pure burger bliss, with no distractions or misdirection hoping to cover up inadequacies. The double patty is recommended.Fries: Angry fries and regular fries are both good, nothing that unique about them or inspired. The angry fries are covered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing, and chunks of blue cheese would have made them more of a good time. These are simply here to complement the burger, they are not the main attraction.Shake: Made fresh in front of you, with real ice cream. A nice shake, but again, not the headliner.I'd rate this burger better than the following Los Angeles & UK based burgers: In N Out, Five Guys, Slaters 50/50, Magnolia House, Fathers Office, Umami Burger, Tommys, The Hat, Fatburger, The Habit.Atmosphere: Outdoor seating can be a bit cold, as it is London after all. Nothing here that is special, as it is a walk-up joint that you carry away.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were craving a good, juicy burger, so we went to Bleeker St. on a Sunday night around 8pm. There was no line and the place was overall pretty empty; I'm assuming it's more bustling in the daytime when the market is open. We ordered the Bleeker Black, bacon cheeseburger, and sweet potato fries. The Bleeker Black was amazing... Quite possibly one of the best burgers I've had in London. The patties were cooked medium rare and were extremely juicy, with a substantial amount of thickness to it too. The cheese oozed from the burger and provided the perfect marriage with the toasted bun. However, I'd knock it down a bit because of one thing: the blood pudding. What makes the Bleeker Black seemingly special is the inclusion of blood pudding in the burger. I had never had the two together before, and was excited to see what that fusion would be like. However, I was met with disappointment (in that regard only; the rest of the burger was great). I wasn't a huge fan of the blood pudding... Not because it didn't taste good, but because it didn't really taste like anything. The pudding didn't add any sort of extra flavor or depth in my opinion, and the burger would have been great without it. I usually look for burger toppings that'll add an extra layer of dimension, and the blood pudding failed to do that. On the other hand, the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger made the cheeseburger 10x better. The bacon was crispy and provided a nice salty crunch to each bite. I'm often met with disappointment when I order bacon with a burger because it's more often than not soggy, limp, and not fresh. Bleeker's bacon was the opposite! Lastly, the sweet potato fries were nothing to rave about. Plus side is that they provide a hefty portion and it comes out piping hot, but the downside is it's a bit undercooked and ends up tasting really mushy. Overall, I would come back to Bleeker St. if I'm ever craving a good ol' juicy burger... But I would do it right by sticking to what's tried and true and opt for a cheeseburger (or double if you're hungry!)",

The guy serving me (super-friendly) told me it was a deep-fried tofu burger which just sounded so different, I had to try it. And it was particularly tasty, I have to say. The portion was a lot smaller than I'd normally expect - somewhere between a slider and a regular burger, so I wouldn't order it again for \u00a36 if I was on a regular budget. People do rave about the other stuff here, so I'd still deffo come back to try the shake and the fries!",

As someone who also once lived on Bleeker St. in New York, I was hoping to reconnect a bit to my old home.Instead I was left with nothing but frustration and dealing with an overwhelming sense of disappointment. \u00a0Why was I so underwhelmed? It really came down to the burger and fries. The fries were way too salty (and I usually add salt to my fries), to the point that I stopped eating them. The burger itself was a major let down. The sesame seed bun was lacking in quality and could have been mistaken for a McDonalds bun. The meat was just sad. It was too small so the bun just engulfed it. The meat was burnt so it resembled more of a overcooked burger of my childhood than a truly flavorful patty.I might try it again in the future in the off chance I went on a down day. However, right now I think this is a just an over hyped burger joint.",

    "text": "*Reviewing veg options*Oh, woe to high expectations! After hearing and reading so much about Bleecker St. burgers, I thought they might offer a decent veg burger. Sadly, this is not the case and I'm afraid I will not be back again unless the menu changes.Perhaps I should give them a little bit of credit given that they gained fame as a food truck. And OK, I know it's a struggle for burger places to get the right balance of street accessibility and flavour when it comes to a non-meat patty, but, come on, be a bit more adventurous. Two crisp tofu squares garnished with a weak piece of lettuce and squirted with some hot sauce I could buy in any shop is a tad disappointing. And at \u00a36!! Eep. There are other places that actually take lentils or beans or mushrooms and cook something for a fiver. And I hate mushrooms...The three stars is for the tofu being good quality and the fries being tasty enough. The sweet potato fries are nice and absolutely satisfied my craving for them, but they were a little too moist for me and way too expensive (\u00a34). We also tried the regular fries, which were quite nice, but doesn't blow my mind away enough to bring me back.I understand that vege-/pescetarians are just not a priority market for burger joints, but there are times I crave a comforting, hearty veg burger and give some a try. Sadly, though I would have loved to give this stand my support, I won't be back for the tofu burger again.",

There wasn't too much sauce and meat was cooked perfectly, although the patty could of been a tiny bit bigger.

    "text": "I came for the opening of the Spitalfields Market location, and boy, was it happening. They offered 50% off food (unfortunately not drinks), but the burgers themselves are not expensive - 6 pounds for a single cheeseburger and 8.50 for a double cheeseburger (no idea how much for the special). They had run out of fries by the point we arrived one hour before closing, but a beer was 4 pounds and soft drinks 1.50. Fairly standard.The queue itself was something to speak of - over an hour's wait for something like 3 pounds saving! They took our order in the queue, brought us our beers while we waited, and when we finally arrived at the front it only took them all of 5 seconds to put our burgers together. There's not much to it; Bleecker skips out all the fancy shenanigans and just makes solid standard burgers (unless you count the specials). Still, less than 5 options.As for the burger, the buns have sesame seeds on them and are well toasted, basically burnt on the edges. Luckily I like slightly charred food so it worked for me. And the meat is red in the middle, essentially raw, which might not be for everyone (also, I hope it indicates something about the quality of the meat...) It's not your average pink. Other than that, there's not much to it. A small piece of lettuce, not even onions for the single.So what's the verdict? Not sure it lived up to the queue or the hype, but it impressed me more than Honest Burgers and it should be noted that it is from a food truck, so I would say the burgers are quite well constructed, all things considered. But as I've said before, the competition for the best burger in London is fierce and many establishments claim some ties to the US or even New York, specifically. I'm unconvinced that Bleecker unseats Shake Shack, the king of all NY burgers.",

    "text": "I can't quite bring myself to join the general chorus of praise for Bleecker. It may be beloved by Instagram and many London-based food writers whom I tend to trust, but for me, this place doesn't live up to the Ludwig-filtered hype.Don't get me wrong, these chaps serve up a pretty good burger. Juicy, well-seasoned, lifted by the crowd-pleasing ying-and-yang of cheese and burger sauce. But in London's ever-crowded burger space, that standard should be the minimum expectation. For me, their single-patty cheeseburger is a tad small. I know we should all be trying to reduce our consumption of red meat, but this lacked the satisfying heft of a good burger. You could, of course, double-up, but at \u00a39.50, once you've thrown in a portion of fries and something to drink, that's pushing you over the \u00a315 mark. Call me a miser, but that's too much for what is still just a simple street-food lunch. \u00a0My other gripe is the lack of variation on offer. I'm a firm believer in restaurants offering short menus of dishes they've mastered, but I'd still like more choices for toppings/additions than just bacon and blue-cheese.",

    "text": "These are the best burgers you'll have in London. I'm not joking. These burger patties are made with high quality beef and served medium rare. They're juicy and incredibly flavorful. The sesame buns are toasted and slightly crispy on the edges. I got a Cheeseburger with onions and cheese. Yes, the burgers here are lacking options for toppings like tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. but what looks like a simple burger is exploding with a medley of flavors when you bite into it. There's a slight charring flavor from the beef and just the right amout of grease to help the flavors blend. The fries are exquisite. I've tried the regular and sweet potatoes fries before and they've never disappointed. They're flavorful and remain crispy down to your last fry. This time I tried the house fries which are regular fries topped with the Bleecker house sauce. Yum! The house sauce is flavorful and creamy and the fries weren't soggy at all. Do yourself a favor and come to Old Spitalfields market for these burgers and fries. Be prepared to wait in line for a little as this is the original location!",

It was so juicy - juice was rolling down their hand. Their facial expressions made me so tempted to try it. They were clearly content.",

It's about \u00a39 and it's \u00a39 well spent.No salad on these bad boys - not that salad is a bad thing necessarily, but they don't need it.Get the chips too if you like, they're pretty good, but honestly it's the burger you want here. Get the double.Five stars because this establishment knows their game. No messing around with hot dogs or salads or low-carb or vegan etc. Their job is to make burgers, and your job is to love them.Easiest job you'll ever do.",

Fries were a bit on the salty side but overall good experience. I got a regular cheeseburger, and it was a bit smaller than I would have liked--if I go again I'll have to get a double or the bleecker st burger.Their claim to fame is that they're a New York style burger, which is pretty spot-on taste wise (I've lived in New York) but New York burgers have a lot more stuffed into them. Again, this might be on me because I just got a regular cheeseburger.",

Kudos to them for being open. The guys were super nice, even when we (unabashed tourists) paid them in all change. We walked a bit, took two sips, and decided that we really wanted fries with it.So we turned back and ordered fries. The guys were still good-natured and told us we should stop by to try the Bleecker black burger (cheeseburger with blood pudding) sometime. We promised to.We sat down at one of their outdoor tables and dipped our fries in our shake and were 100% happy with life. It's 100x better than Shake Shack and it's unfortunate that it doesn't exist in the States.",

First off, it's not a total grease fest like other chains seem to pride themselves on - I'm looking at you, Dirty Burger and Meat Liquor. And yes, I admit the single version isn't a vast amount of meat. But, it's enough. More than enough (if you absolutely need a huge chunk of beef, order the double). The sweet potato fries were exquisite: salty, sweet, like eating starchy candy. I easily polished off a big cup. My only slightly critical comment is that it took them a wee while to serve it. But then it was well worth the wait.",
