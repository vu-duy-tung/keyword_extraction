I had the nachos (basically fried ravioli) and the prawn linguine. I was expecting it to be amazing for the money I paid (it was $18 just for the pasta in USD) and I didn't feel like it was worth that money. The ingredients were fresh, yes, but the food wasn't as good I thought it'd be. I wouldn't go back again.",

Since he has his name on the place I was hoping to get something he would be happy to serve himself.Got nothing near my expectations. Starter was a truffle risotto, it was wet, soggy and bland. Tasted more like a rice poridge then a risotto. The main corse was a daily special - Cod baked in aluminum foil with mussels, clams and tomato sauce. There was so much sand in the dish from the clams it was inpossible to eat. Besides the sand in the food this dish also was bland. Great service, but realy disapointing meal. Jamie wouldnt serve what we got to his worst enemy, why us?",

Swaying towards a veggie dish for ethical reasons, I plumped for truffle risotto. As noted by another reviewer, it was bland, homogenous and deeply uninspiring. However, my companion's burger and wafer steaks were greedily (and wholly) consumed with a minimum of fuss so I believe they were satisfied. Even though I didn't enjoy the main, Jamie's still managed to win my favour, and I would go back, but not for risotto.",

Luckily I wasn't and I was also wearing 3 layers to protect myself against the chilly August weather as we had a drink outside. I've been to Jamie's Italian in Kingston and wasn't that impressed but here we had some tasty starters that arrived very quickly - nice squid, fun ravioli \"nachos\" and arancini. I picked the prawn linguine as my main as it's my sister's favourite dish to cook from Jamie Oliver's cookbook and was again pleasantly surprised - really liked the fennel element. The pasta was super al dente, either I've been getting it really wrong or it was slightly undercooked, but it worked well. The desserts weren't so good - I tried both the lemon slice and the tiramisu and wasn't too fond of either. The orange mascarpone in the tiramisu overwhelmed the other flavours and the lemon slice just had too many things going on for my taste - I thought just the mint would have been the perfect complement, without the pistachios and berries.We had an extremely enthusiastic server who did a good job but honestly, we would have tipped her well without all the chat. However, nice to see someone enjoying their work!Despite the relatively good experience, I can't bring myself to give it four stars. There's much better food in this area (well, in Soho) and to wait this long and pay these prices for what is essentially a chain restaurant is probably going to leave a lot of people somewhat aggrieved. However, with better desserts, I might stop trying to be cool and call myself a fan.",

I ordered the ricotta bruschetta which tasted like top the tater on a piece of bread with tomatoes that were not fresh. The rocket side salad was much better and the bruschetta was almost double the price. The turkey was large, but needed more seasoning and was very dry. I would skip this next time and try something else.",

I was NOT disappointed! The portions were on the generous side, especially the tender, flavorful mixed grill (various game). The house red was a treat - it's Spanish, and probably the best house wine I have ever had - and the cocktail list was creative. I avoid gluten and the waitress, also gluten free, was extremely helpful in highlighting the plentiful GF options...I didn't even have to ask, as she offered. We sat in the back corner in the basement and it was cozy and casual, empty when we got there (5pm, super early as we were going to a show) and it filled up fast. Reservations for parties of 6+ only. Delish...is he bringing it stateside?",

Everytime we needed something from her we tried new ways of attracting her attention (seemed more interested in hanging out by the water station chatting with her colleagues).- Ambiance is fine, but this place is decievingly huge. \u00a0They've nicely broken all that space into separate dining room areas to make it seem more intimate. \u00a0Each room felt like it had it's own vibe. \u00a0I liked being in the back room, the one downstairs also looked nice.- Food was a mixed bag. Starters of fried squid and bruschetta were ok - not memorable. \u00a0I had the mussels and squid ink pasta - which was phenomenal and 5-star worthy and would RECOMMEND. \u00a0My companion has their signature prawn pasta dish. Though the flavor was good, the pasta was gummy (like maybe it'd been overcooked, or wasn't fresh - we couldn't decide what the problem was other than it was a big, mushy gooey consistency). \u00a0This really stood out in contrast to mine.- Prices were reasonable for what you received.BOTTOM LINE: OK experience to say I tried it. Think it showed the potential to be far better than it is. Wouldn't be on my list to go back to again.",

Unfortunately a dental affliction meant I was limited to the softer side of the food pyramid so I decided not to blow massive cash on food I couldn't chew properly and went with soft, safe, Italian.There was a bit of a wait (30 minutes), and not a lot of room at the bar, but it wasn't altogether unexpected on a Friday night so no big deal. We got taken downstairs to basically the perfect table - corner booths for the win!We ordered the meat board for two as a starter, carbonara and lasagna for the mains. Everything was tasty, looked great on the plate and considering how busy the restaurant was, the service was fast too. It wasn't the best carbonara I've ever had, but the lasagna was amazing.I wish I could say that I got dessert as well, but I thought the menu was a bit boring so gave it a miss.",

The only strange thing was that they made us choose between two menus a week in advance for a party of 7. Usually we can at least just order off either back in the states so we found that a bit strange, but nothing too terrible.I had the rump steak and it was DELICIOUS. I mean, when you think rump steak you're not thinking something as delicious and tender as I had. One of the best steaks I've had in a while not to mention it had pesto sauce so obviously that was an amazing combo. Also, the truffle pasta that came before it was so so so good. I hate truffle but the pasta and the sauce were so good I didn't even care.Our server was so sweet too, I wish I could remember her name to give her a nice shoutout. Whoever the sweet lil' blonde gal was, we thank you for a great meal. :-)",

Mind you, one of the members of my party had the gold card, or whatever it's called, so they were particularly attentive. Nonetheless, this was a much cooler Jamie's and I especially liked sitting downstairs in the booths, where it reminds you of a true wine cellar. The food was delicious, and we had quite a range, from steak to squid ink pasta to chicken cutlet and a few traditional pasta dishes. We also had bellinis and wine and generally enjoyed ourselves. Our server was very friendly and attentive, as well.I'd recommend this far more than the Jamie's near the City, only because the atmosphere feels much more authentically Italian here. Other than that, it's your normal Jamie's, and you can have a great time if you're up for the experience.",

You are crammed in so you will be sitting close to people, but the food is outstanding. We really enjoyed the italian nachos and the bolognese. They make their own pasta and it shows. It is excellent. Please note however that if you are used to getting grilled chicken breast on your caesar salad, then know that here and in most of london its, a grilled skin-on thigh on your salad. Other than that, the food was great, they have a nice wine list and the service is great.",

Unfortunately the experience wasn't what we had hoped for. First of all, we were seated downstairs where it's kinda dark and boring - no feel of the Jamie charm. The waiters were only as friendly as they had to be and also walked past many times without noticing us. When I asked if a smaller portion of the pasta would be enough for my small appetite, he absolutely exaggerated the tininess of the plate which resulted in me ordering the bigger plate and then leaving half the dish uneaten. Obviously he did this to make me spend more but I just found it very dislikeable. Both our pasta dishes were good but nothing special.

So this time, we made the reservation when we just arrived in London. He paid no attention to us when he took our order. \u00a0He came over to our table and asked us what we wanted, so we told him the dishes we wanted to order. However, he kept looking somewhere else and murmuring to himself WHILE taking our orders. We had to repeat our order three times! When we asked him what he was doing, he answered \"nothing\" and continued looking into the distance and murmuring to himself. His action was extremely rude and showed how much he really \"cared\" about his customers. \u00a0Also, when I placed my order with \"artisan bread basket\", he tried to force me to order garlic bread twice. \u00a0He finally stopped trying when I said \"I just want artisan bread basket and I don't fancy garlic bread.\" \u00a0While we were dining, he never greeted us like other waiters usually did. \u00a0He just stood in front of a station and chatted with his friend (not worker at Jamie's kitchen) right next to our table. At the time, we decided that we wanted to leave without dessert because of his poor service. \u00a0When he returned with the change (I paid cash), he didn't even say \"thank you,\" just \"here ya go.\" We decided to request correct change when we found out it was short with 5 pence. \u00a0After we told him, he blamed us for paying with cash and even made up excuses like \"oh I don't have 5 pence\" and \"I asked all of my colleague and they don't have 5 pence.\" Don't get me wrong, 5 pence is very little money, but the fact that he didn't tell us beforehand and started blaming us instead was unacceptable. He treated us like beggars when he gave the 5 pence back. On the way out of the restaurant, we decided to tell the manager of the restaurant about his unacceptably poor service and rude attitude. \u00a0Even though we got the money back, we were outraged and our good memory of this place was totally gone. Please be aware when you go there. \u00a0Check the name if Sebastia is your waiter. \u00a0Leave or change table!",

Front desk and bar staff were pleasant and efficient. Our server seemed a bit distracted but no harm no foul. FIrst course (veggie platter and crispy polenta) was delish. Main course - mushroom ravioli were great. Truffle risotto - meh. The rice wasn't cooked and it tasted more of olive oil than truffle. Dessert was tastey though - pana cotta and brownie. If the risotto was my only experience, I wouldn't be a fan. But everything else more than made up for it. I only wish I lived closer so I could try something else to redeem my rating.",

    "text": "I have been living in London for almost 4 years now and I always tried to avoid 'tourists' restaurants such as Zizzi, Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, Prezzo, Carluccio's, Angus Steakhouse...(and even Starbucks!) because I prefer to give my money to a smaller company that pays more attention to customer and offers better quality food.I went only once to a Jamie Oliver's restaurants : it was in 2013, I went to his new restaurant Jamie Oliver's Diner and I didn't like it (burnt and dry burgers with soggy fries). \u00a0Since then, my parents went for diner to Jamie's Fifteen in Amsterdam and had a lovely time. Only fools do not change their minds...so my boyfriend and I went to lunch at Jamie's Italian on a Saturday, the place was packed with families and couples - surprisingly mostly English people (not that many tourists!) Both hungover, we decided to start our meal with two non-alcoholic cocktails, both were good and very refreshing. As starters we shared crispy porcini mushroom arancini and the special starter of the day: scallops served with peas and bacon. Both of us enjoyed the arancini, they were great even if I thought they could have been a bit more creamy inside and more crispy on the outside.The arrabbiata was really tasty and full of flavour. The second starter was just ok but a bit bland, nothing really special about scallops with mushy peas, a slice of crispy bacon and breadcrumbs especially if you could hardly taste the scallops! My boyfriend and I were a bit disappointed by the size of the scallops, they were very tiny, same size as the one you can find in Tesco! The dish was around \u00a38.50, which I think is totally overpriced considering the tiny size of the scallops. For mains, we decided to play the adventurous card, we both ordered from the special boards. My boyfriend had the homemade pasta dish with cumberland sausage and I had the special fish dish. His pasta dish was very good. It tasted fresh and light, the yellow pepper sauce was the highlight of this dish and tasted very summery. My dish was a sustainable tuna sliced steak, the whole dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the tuna was pink in the middle as I like it, and asparagus were a bit crunchy. I didn't like the cold truffle potatoes and I think it didn't add anything to the dish. To compliment our mains, we had some polenta chips on the side. They were perfect, light and cripsy. Only bad thing is that they arrived 10 minutes after our main dishes. It was a nice experience but nothing exceptional. Some dishes were a bit bland and overpriced in my opinion for what they were, special mains were both good but I think it could be easy to find something similar for cheaper elsewhere in central London. Overall I just felt the food was a bit average and not anything over the top. We had a great service, we didn't wait too much time between dishes apart from our side, which is not too bad considering the restaurant was full. \u00a0Even if this recent experience has been better than my Jamie Oliver's Diner memories, I am afraid my opinion hasn't change a lot, I don't think I will become a Jamie's Oliver restaurant fan soon. I will stick only to his TV shows, which I like.",

After asking if the caprese salad had any garlic in and the waiter saying no, he then went and double checked with the chef who actually said the tomatoes were marinated in a garlic oil.. This small extra mile massively stands out. It was lunchtime so I went with the mozzarella, melon and Parma ham salad minus the pesto dressing. It was really delicious and much more filling than I expected. We had skinny fries and polenta chips to share - not sure about the latter, perhaps an acquired taste?! Only 4 stars as the non alcoholic ginger mojito really just tasted like limeade and was a bit disappointing for the extra pennies spent on it. The restaurant is bigger than you think with plenty of seating downstairs too.",

We ate pasta and some antipasti and had to wait for it ca. 20min which was alright as the restaurant was crowded. Luckily we ordered enough food because from the main dish alone, I didn't feel full.

    "text": "Worst Italian food in London, hands down.My fist Yelp review, and I've been using Yelp for years. Wanted to add my voice to those warning people away from this place.I had a reasonable amount of respect for Jamie Oliver. I've learned a few things from his cooking shows. Thought his campaigning for better school food was a noble one. And Fifteen, his original restaurant, was my go to place to entertain friends visiting London. Had many very satisfying, reasonably priced meals there... until something changed a couple of years ago. Tables were crammed in, menu changed to tapas everything, prices raised, and I was asked where I was from about 5 times from the staff. Needless to say, the food quality and overall experience plummeted, and the bill doubled. Haven't been back, and became sceptical of his other establishments multiplying across the city.My family was in the Covent Garden area for my daughter's birthday a few weeks ago. My wife suggested we try Jamie's Italian for dinner, as she heard that it was good for kids. I reluctantly agreed. After about a 25 minute wait (at 5:15 on a Thursday), we were seated. We all ordered pasta, myself a meatball pappardelle, for my daughter a \"cheesy pasta bake\" (which was described as having an \"organic seven-veg tomato sauce\").Cooked ground meat that has been defrosted in the microwave gets a dry rubberiness. This is exactly the texture of the meatballs with my pasta. The pasta was also quite dry, and I believe the chef forgot to include flavour with the dish, as it had none. Typically I will eat what is in front of me. I couldn't eat this. To his credit, the waiter noticed that my meal wasn't being eaten. Out of character, I gave him my full opinion of the dish. He offered to replace it. I ordered a different pasta. It was better, but no better than a cheap sauce out of a jar. This is the very first time I've had a meal sent back. It was that bad.My daughter's meal was also a disaster. She just picked at it and wasn't all that interested in \u00a0it. I tried it, the pasta was well done, and the dish had no flavour. There was no cheesy crust, no sauce, no colour. It appeared to be just a bowl of fusilli. \u00a0I asked the waiter about the cheese part of the cheesy pasta bake, and he explained that it was a sauce mixed in. If this was true, there was very little of it, and it was flavourless. This bland, mushy, beige dish, with zero nutritional value, is exactly the type of rubbish that Mr. Oliver was working at having removed from the plates of children at school. Here it is on the plates of his establishment. I understand that Jamie Oliver is very busy and likely has little involvement in this restaurant, but considering how bad this was, I would say his involvement is about as close to Ronald McDonald's involvement in the kitchen flipping burgers...none. Mr. Oliver should be horrified that his name is associated with this place. Upon exiting, there were about 20 people waiting for tables. Likely all tourists basing their dining decision on the name. They won't be back, neither will we.",

Not that I wasn't before, but seriously even without the school dinners campaign, this man is changing my culinary life slowly, so much so, that any time an Italian restaurant is mentioned, my response is \"Just go to Jamie's Italian... seriously, it's aaaaaaaaamazing.\"It started on a Sunday morning back at the parents, I happened to glance at the TV in the background that had Jamie Oliver cooking his Pan-Asian salmon recipe. Then the making of the recipe for a friend. It was aaaaaaaaaaamazing. Then the buying of a book. Then going to the restaurant chain and eating the most aaaaaaaamazing mozzarella ball with fresh green pesto. Or fresh green olives on ice with the most amazing sun-dried tomatoes and black olive tapenade. The list goes on.The staff are all uber-friendly nationwide (I've also been to one in Oxford) and the loos are very amusing. I like the decor, the tins of tomatoes, the atmosphere. Seriously, what is there not to love? When choosing a main, there's a choice between a small and large plate (just in case, you're too full from eating starters) and the desserts, especially the brownie with raspberries and vanilla ice cream... worth saving space for. I could go on but I fear I may sound a tad deranged and fan-crazy. I'll end on this note, there isn't anything on the menu that I wouldn't eat and it's just a great place to have a nice meal. I heart Jamie's Italian. Big Time. In fact, I would say it was aaaaaaa..... I'll stop now.",

Got a seat downstairs, which I didn't know existed. Good atmosphere. Had the meat antipasto, which was excellent -- best mozzarella I've ever had, meats were very fresh, it was great. Ordered the crab and squid ink risotto for dinner....good portion of risotto, kind of skimpy on the crab, but, when mixed with the panko, the flavors really worked. My only complaint -- the risotto was undercooked. I was a tad disappointed -- I wished I had gotten something else. The dishes around me looked excellent. Wrapped up dinner with a cappuccino and the chocolate espresso tartlet, which was good. The orange cream was refreshing.  I'd definitely go back, but I'd skip the risotto.",

Fortunately, we didn't waste time waiting for dinner here, it would have been a bigger disappointment. The waitstaff, though eager and bright-eyed had only a passing knowledge of the menu, although they were eager to try to sell us a t-shirt or other souvenir. I can only believe that fans of this place are dazzled by the \"rep\" and haven't noticed the food. Wild horses couldn't drag me back in here.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to do this review since mid November but my experience is still fresh in my mind and it makes my mouth water every time I think about it. When my boyfriend said he wanted us to have dinner here I did what we all do and check out the reviews. Lachlan M's review offered great advise, ta very much! We arrived 45 minutes before we wanted to eat and were given a pager and we got beeped after 20 minutes result! Both being piggies we decided to eat like the Italians do. I don't think I've ever been so engrossed in a menu. Our poor waiter came over a couple of times to see if we were ready but after we order a glass of bubbly he graciously left us to it. After much debate with each other and advice from our waiter we chose:For starters - crispy squid, mushroom fritti and smoky scamorza arancini (crispy rice balls with mozzarella). We shared 3 starters as I couldn't bear the thought of food envy! The squid could have done with a bit more of a kick but it was gorgeous anyway. The mushrooms and rice balls were amazing and both had great dipping sauces.Pasta - I had the pumpkin panzerotti but was concerned it would be too sweet with the ameretti so the waiter suggested the ameretti on the side PERFECTION! My boyfriend chose the wild truffle tagliatelle which he thoroughly enjoyed. We both opted for the smaller sized portion so we could squeeze in our secondi!Secondi - I was a major pig and ordered the lamb chops and posh chips on the side (Posh means covered in truffle oil and parmesan YUM!!!!!!!!) My boyfriend chose the risotto of the day which I think was porcini and gorgonzola. We going to share the posh chips but as soon as they arrived i decided there was no way I was going to share them so we ordered another on top!I know you're thinking how could anyone want anything more on top of that. Well I did! After such a rich meal I felt I needed something to clear my palette so I got a few scoops of fruit sorbet to round off the evening.The whole evening was brilliant and the service was exceptional. Even with the high demand for tables as you can't booked unless for large groups at no point did we feel rushed to free up the table. Our waiter was charming and very informative. And to top it all off the meal was amazing value!In the words of Jamie Oliver, lovely jubbly!",

Everything experienced through those mediums came rising to life the moment I stepped up. Afraid I would arrive too late, or get mixed up in the tube, I decided to walk a couple miles through London (not the worst thing in the world), then wait an hour to be seated. The staff was bubbly, alert, very friendly, and offered to let me wait next to the serving bar with a glass of wine while a single table opened up. The bar team kept the jokes, smiles and banter going while I sipped a house red. You could tell this was a good place to work, where the pride rested in food and delivery, not pomp and circumstance.I ordered an olive pesto appetizer with sparkling water and a simple spaghetti. Every piece of this experience was enjoyable. I even walked away with a package of Jamie's kitchen towels. Yet, that's the great thing about Jamie's food - no matter where you go, it finds a way back to your kitchen.",

Having been to the Greenwich location previously and rather enjoyed ourselves there we thought this would be an okay substitute. But we were fooled. The service was horrendous. After being seated it took our waitress 40 minutes to even say hello and ask if we wanted any drinks. Wine took another 15 minutes to arrive. Some drinks were forgotten and never showed up at all, same with a few starters. We all had pasta dishes which were bland, and of course took an hour to arrive after being ordered. All in all we spent 2.5 hours with the unattentive waitress, the boring overpriced food and the way too dry wine. Not going back there again.",

    "text": "I love Jamie Oliver. I love his shows but I couldn't say so for his restaurant.Firstly, we had to wait over 2 1/2 hrs on a Sunday evening for the 8 of us as it doesn't take any bookings. When we arrived at 5.30pm, we were told to come back again around 7pm as it's still quite empty. We went back at 6pm (just in case) and we were told to wait for 2 1/2 hrs. Not impressed at all. If it wasn't for a friend's birthday, I would not have returned.We were given a buzzer & must be at least 200meters to the restaurant or the buzzer wouldn't work. Why don't they chain that buzzer to my ankle as I felt I am in prison since we were restricted where to go during our 2 1/2 hrs wait. There isn't a bar in the restaurant where we can sit & drink while we wait so we had to be somewhere close by or stand in the street like a lemon.The front of house was also very rude. We weren't impressed with his attitude. He didn't smile. He wasn't helpful. When he told us to wait, it feels as if he couldn't care less if we returned and never suggested where to go. He just didn't care. He shouldn't be at the front of house!The waitress who was serving us was very friendly & welcoming. However, she has mislead us to think that the \u00a349 T-bone steak to be shared between 2 people would be a huge steak. The menu never stated how much the steak weighs but since the waitress emphised how huge it was, it came to a disappointment that this steak feeds 1 man or 2 ladies with small appitite. The wild boar salami was thinner than a Sainsbury Basics Waffer Ham which almost shattered into pieces when you touch it. The scallops with squid ink linguine was very salty, garlicy and dry... and the scallps were chopped into tiny pieces. If I pieced them together, it probably came up to 3 whole scallops. I could barely taste the squid ink in the linguine whereas I could when I had this dish in another Italian restaurant. We weren't impressed with the food nor the waiting hours. I will give it a one star but since the waitress tried really hard to entertain us, I've given it a 2 star. Go there for the ambience, but not the food. There are far more fantastic Italian restaurants which is run by real Italian families.",

    "text": "Went here with a workmate on a Wednesday night. The key to this place is planning. The place is popular and they don't take reservations for groups less than 6, so plan to get there at least 45mins before you want to be seated. They will give you a buzzer/pager and you can go have drinks somewhere nearby.Once you get past the tricky part of getting a table, you should be set for an evening of good service, good food and reasonable prices.To start we had a glass of Prosecco each and some truffled salami, fried squid with garlicky mayo and baked mushrooms.The mushrooms were simply amazing and the truffled salami was pretty tasty too. The squid was good without being exceptional.I was tossing up between two different bottles of wine to go with for our meal and was pleasantly surprised when the waiter simply offered to bring me a taste of both to see which I preferred. Excellent!For my main I had a small of the truffle tagliatelle (I know, I know, truffle salami, truffle pasta -- I'm going through a truffle phase ...) and it was brilliant -- probably smaller than I would have liked. If I had my time over, I'd have gone with the larger size. I feel like the small size pastas are designed for if you are eating \"Italian Style\" where you have starters, pasta and then secondi (main course).My friend had the carbonara, which he said was tasty without being exceptional. For the dessert I had the brownie with bourbon ice-cream. I felt the ice-cream could have had a bit more oomph to it in the bourbon sense but the dessert was tasty all the same.The things that made this place really stand out to me were:* Great friendly service, not being rushed out the door despite it being busy* Really funky d\u00e9cor - once you get inside they have some pretty cool design going on* Baked mushroom starter* Truffle tagliatelle* Price -- For two people it was a about \u00a363, which from what I have seen in London is pretty damn cheap for 3 courses, a starter of bubbly and bottle of wine.Plan your trip to this place wisely and you will have a memorable evening.",

The calimari sadly, left a lot to be desired, but the main dishes are great. The service is alos scary good- our waiter was fun to talk to and remembered all the orders of our huge group.The atmosphere is that of upper-class London dining, and is reflected in the quality of the food. However, you know me, I prefer a cheaper hole-in-the wall experience, and you certainly won't find that here, which is why I can only give it a 4. That being said, quality cheap italian is not the easiest to come by, and at Jamie Oliver's you know that what you are getting will be well prepared and delicious. The portions are nice too- just small enough that you can have an appatizer and not find yourself full to bursting. It's on the more touristy side, but if you can hack the chaos of covent garden, that won't bother you a bit!",

We got seated fairly quickly with no reservations. There's lots to choose from as the menu is massive. Not thinking about portion sizes we ordered the plank for two, arancini balls, crab and avocado bruschetta, and pancetta carbonara all to share. We also ordered a half carafe of the house wine to share.The plank for two is a pretty good portion of meats and cheeses for two people. I think we should have just ordered that! We were really stuffed after everything! For me there was just too much fried things that filled me up with not a lot of flavor. The arancini balls and I guess the polenta fries that came with the plank were just ok. The bruschetta, was super filling and it was on a huge piece of toast so it was a bit difficult to share. The carbonara was good but I just wanted more sauce and for it to be a bit more flavorful and spicy.All in all the meal was satisfactory. The ambiance was great and our server was very nice to us. He even sat down next to us as we asked for recommendations on what to see and do around the area! Would recommend this place for a solid happy hour choice!",

So, it was definitely a good surprise!",

I thought it was great.I did notice a lot of tables ordering chips with their main course, so perhaps the English don't quite get pasta and it's delicious tradition.I had the bolognese which was fabulous. After we had all eaten our various mains I ordered another main for tasting / sharing. It was a spinach and ricotta ravioli. Delicious and a fantastic sauce.Come on England give your countryman the 5 stars he deserves in future ok ?Proper Italian from the naked chef himself.",

No sauce....and too chunky of pieces... like square blocks. Was very plain and too chunky. However the special of the day was absolutely one of my favorite pastas. The truffle oil brought out the mushroom taste and it was delicious. I ate the WHOLE thing. Which is rare. My friend ordered the meat ball with pasta. It was OK... not the best meatballs i've had...they were too herby for me. Ooo...another thing..the waitstaff...not so helpful with recommendations and was a bit unorganized. For example... no plates provided...and a bit all over the place. Maybe she was having a bad day~~ who knows~ I might come back if i have dreams of the mushroom pasta...but maybe not~ Although \u00a0my pasta was really good~ was not really impressed with waitstaff~",

My main which was the steak was cooked beautifully medium rare. It was tasty, well seasoned and delicious. My partner had the Porchetta, which was made into a Christmas dream, great cut of pork served with apples and in season vegetables. Ended off the meal with meringue and a chocolate cake. It was perfect. Now I know why, they always sell out of this menu. Thanks for the amazing dinner. Till next year. Cheers",

    "text": "This place always has a pretty long wait but I managed to get a table on a Wednesday night within 15 min (checked in at 7pm, got a table by 7:15pm). The inside of this restaurant is quite nice and I like the comforting and welcoming atmosphere. They offer \"appetizer\" and \"entree\" sizes for most of their pasta dishes, which is pretty unique and very helpful if you're not that hungry and don't want to spend too much on dinner.That being said, while the crab and avocado bruschetta was really good-the crab was really fresh and flavorful-it was a really small portion for the price of 7 pounds. It was worth it because of the great contrasting flavors and textures of the smooth avocado paste, juicy shredded crab meat, crunchy sourdough and ribbons of green apple. My friend ordered the smaller version of the pasta pomodoro, which was pretty good (tomato sauce was fresh with lots of tomatoes, parmesan was quality and added cheesiness), it tasted like most other pasta dishes that I've had in the past. I did however really enjoy how the pasta was al dente, it seems that the pasta in Europe is cooked for less time than in the US, leaving them firmer and in my opinion, more enjoyable to eat. The small plate was 6.25 pounds.After I finished the bruschetta I was still a little hungry so we ordered the bread which came on a plank. There were 4 types, but my favorites were the foccacia and the sourdough. It came with olive and sundried tomato tapenades which was very tasty and complemented the bread well. The only problem I had with the bread was that a fairly small portion cost 4 pounds which is kind of ridiculous considering that it's just bread.Overall, would definitely recommend this place for a reasonably priced dinner if you're not too hungry. Next time I want to try the cheesecake dessert which looked amazing! I'll be back to try a seafood pasta dish, which sounded really delicious!",

The price was not worth the quality of food or service provided. This place should be ashamed of the service it provided and the quality of food it served. There are many other great restaurants to pick from in the area (in fact, Dishoom which is right next door to this place is amazing). \u00a0Save yourself time and frustration and go elsewhere.",

My wife has a few food intolerances so we made sure when we went in we explained to the waiter, who then called over the manager who with my wife's help came up with a off the cuff dish which she could eat; which she did! The waiter and manager were very good and attentive to us and made sure we were enjoying the food with me having a pasta dish with squid and octopus which was next level, the two youngest had a pasta bake which they said was ok and my eldest had a burger which I had a nibble of and was lovely and juicy. The quality of food and service are fantastic for the cost if the meal which was \u00a375 with mains, deserts and drinks.",

I understand he is a restaurateur and celebrity now and not really a chef cooking anymore. He is just lending his name and brand but holy cow this was a bad experience. The restaurant was under staff and confirmed by our server who was less then trilled to be there. We should have left right then but we were hungry and tired of walking so we stayed. After waiting forever for our wine, then our food, we finally get the bonus of flavorless and tiny pastas. My wife ordered crab pasta - no exaggeration very little crab (see photo). The highlight was the starter scallops, they were very good with great mushy peas. The server did try to save the night by giving us more wine on the house.... But be warned Jamie is not there and the standards are very low.",

ALL HYPE... not worth it folks!I think Pasta Pomodoro in the Bay Area does more justice in making Italian food than this place. We were a party of six and dined downstairs... token \"colored\" people with a token Brit in our group... I didn't particularly loved the staring that the people next to us were giving our party... ignorance still exist! :)Anyway... service sucked. My sister ordered about 5 bottles of wine... yet our dinner entrees didn't arrive until it was closing time and mind you, it wasn't packed. The delay time from appetizers to dinner was mind blowing that by the time our food came, we lost our appetite. Oh wait, maybe we lost it because it WAS that bad!It was so bad... I didn't remember the numerous appetizers my sister ordered. I did remember my Honeycomb cannelloni trio for \u00a0\u00a311.45 (Aubergine & sun-dried tomato; pumpkin; ricotta & spinach) and it was ECK! It literally tasted like frozen cannelloni. Long story short: don't bother going here. Not worth your gazillion GBP pounds! Such a disappoint for our reunion with a family friend that my family and I haven't seen for 20 years. Not even the amount of wine we consumed help make us eat what they served food.",

There were still some shell parts on the crab. Yum! Without the fact I tasted barely anything but salt, it was fairly okay. (Don't think I never eat salt, cause I love it. But even for me, this was too much.)We were sat outside on a small table and wooden bench. For such an expensive restaurant, I expected more than that.Waiters were very nice.Cocktails were amazing!

Our waitress explained the different meats and cheeses, describing the flavours and even recommended we eat one particular meat last so that it's flavour didn't overpower our palates and ruin tasting the other meats, which was a helpful tip.I opted for a delicious sounding special of scallop and truffle spaghetti with prosciutto and leeks. My mum opted for a summer Gorgonzola risotto.Our portions were a good size, but unfortunately I was really disappointed in mine. It was quite oily and tasteless, the spaghetti stuck together and scallops stingy in portion. My mums risotto was tasty but very rich so she couldn't finish it and asked for a box to take half of it home with her. They don't do boxes but our kind waitress did wrap it in a foil parcel for us instead. A mixed experience... Nice service but not the best food. There are certainly better Italian restaurants out there, and at \u00a315.95 for my dish, I certainly left feeling a bit disappointed.",

( see menu pict).the starters were awesome. polenta was made fresh and served piping hot with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. nice crisp coating on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. \u00a0one bite and steam comes out from the inside telling its made to order. the steak was served medium as per request. tender and cooked perfectly. no need for A1 sauce or whatever, it was seasoned just right. each bite was juicy goodness and outside was charred beautifully. the carbonara was nothing to rave about except that it was good. no wow factor. the plus factor however, was that they used real pancetta pieces as garnish. very nice touch!the chicken breast was also cooked, seasoned, and charred perfectly. inside was not dry but tender and moist. shows you the skill set of the chef. the best dish of the dinner service was the truffle pasta.! pasta was al dente. sauce was so immaculate. creamy and rich in truffle flavour. one bite and it brought tears to my eyes. such talent and craftsmanship. wow! to kick it up a notch, the dish was sprinkled with bits of truffles. the saltiness of the truffles and the creamy sauce just took this dish to a whole new level. when eaten together, you know you've got a winner! elevates the taste buds and senses to new heights like no other. its simplicity is also is most powerful attribute! a must visit when in UK!! cheers! happy eating!!",

    "text": "Honestly, i don't know why Jaime Oliver has a chain of restaurants. The only reason why we went there is because Dishoom (next door) was packed. Jaime makes Chef Boyardee a world class chef. Starters were cold, broccoli was burnt and no taste of garlic (as advertised). We ended up paying for the food since we were too embarrassed to tell the manager how disappointed we were with the food. At the end of it all, we ended up waiting over an hour for Dishoom since their food is to die for. Hope i can get enough alcohol to wash away the after taste of that \"food.\"Jaime Oliver, do the world a favor, burn down your establishments. Or at least let someone else who can cook a place to do what you can't.",

Jamie's Italian was reasonably priced, no wait, great for families, a full meal or bites and a drink. We had drinks and a few bar bites: calamari, cold olives and tapenade, and croquets. All were delicious! The croquettes were light and airy, the cold Oliver's and tapenade were out of this world-spicy and fresh with sun dried tomato. The calamari was light and fresh. Overall we loved the food and enjoyed our experience. I am a huge Jamie Oliver fan and was not disappointed!",

My husband got the Bolognese, which was pretty good, \u00a0but my seafood pasta was just ok- a little too al dente for my taste.

The pasta was soggy and overcooked for the pasta bolognese, which was upsetting because I think the bolognese itself wasn't bad. The real disappointment was from the brownie dessert, which tasted like something I could pick up at the airport. The texture was really weird, soft, and sticky. I do like that it came with popcorn for the much needed added crunch, but it should have come with a lot more popcorn to compensate for the bizarre mouthfeel that the brownie itself had.",

We finally figured out that maybe a Manhattan belongs in the US not in London. \u00a0My mother in law's gin and tonic was light on the gin and my Aperol spritz was also pretty weak. \u00a0Natalie, our server, was so friendly and just super sweet! \u00a0Her fun and cheerful demeanor more than made up for the awful cocktail snafus. \u00a0She even brought over another Manhattan for free. \u00a0We loved her! \u00a0If you stop in, make sure you ask to be seated in her section. ;) \u00a0Now the food on the other hand, was good. \u00a0We ordered the crispy calamari which was super crispy yet tender on the inside and laying on a nice aioli sauce. \u00a0Lobster ravioli was kinda disappointing, nice sauce but ravioli was undercooked and the lobster just meh. Garlic prawn pasta was delish and full of plump shrimp. \u00a0I opted for an appetizer of truffle linguini but added shrimp. They accidentally also added chicken but it complemented the already delicious \u00a0plate quite nicely. \u00a0Loved that they offered 2 sizes on dinners. \u00a0Usually portions are huge and you end up eating way too much or letting food go to waste. \u00a0Thumbs up for that! \u00a0So I say go for the food, but sneak in your booze.",

The staff were lovely and took my number so we could mooch around Covent Garden for 20 minutes before they called to say the table was ready. It's a lively place with a bit of a canteen feel, super-efficient service and food which, as you'd expect, was nothing short of fantastic.

    "text": "I was keen to try Jamies Italian, but went there doubtful that a chain restaurant run by a celebrity chef would deliver all it promised.Have to say I was very impressed! Service was excellent, food presented with great care and style, good range of items on the menu and very reasonable prices - what more can you ask for! You will have to queue for a table, but we found that once seated we weren't rushed through the meal at all and had plenty of time to make meal choices and linger over wine and coffee. Pasta comes in two size options which is great if like me you'd rather have 3 small courses than 1 giant one. Only downside was that they'd sold out of Tiramisu, but the Choc tart was a delicious alternative.There's obviously been a lot of thought and attention to detail in the creation of the 'Jamies Italian' chain and while I can't speak for all, this Covent Garden location is certianly worth a visit. Well done Mr Oliver.",

We waited about 20 minutes. \u00a0Excellent Best Humble green salad dressed well, pasta was delicious and the lemon cake divine. \u00a0I was really impressed. \u00a0When I returned to London 1 month later I took my two friends as a treat to end a great visit. \u00a0It was awful, and it's the negative visits that last in your mind. \u00a0Mostly, because you are paying good money for an experience you could do better yourself. \u00a0I ordered the exact same items because I loved them so much the first time. \u00a0We waited 75 minutes for a table, but that was OK as we were expecting and excellent experience. Three of us were seated literally at a 2 seat table and they brought up another chair. \u00a0There was no room on the table for our 3 plates, glasses etc when our food came and our plates had to be at odd angles for us to eat. Two of us are very tall and couldn't help but be uncomfortable with leg room. \u00a0My salad had water all over the lettuce that diluted the dressing. \u00a0My pasta was literally standing in water as it wasn't drained. \u00a0The lemon cake was still good. My friends food didn't arrive together. \u00a0All in all it was supposed to be a celebratory last dinner and turned out to be uncomfortable, and poor service and food production. \u00a0I wouldn't go back.On the way home we passed Wagamama and wished we had gone there instead.",

She booked us a table in advance so we were seated very quickly downstairs. I noticed how packed this restaurant was as soon as we got to the front door. Took that as a good sign. We ordered a few appetizers, entrees and desserts (I can't remember what anymore but we were all quiet as we devoured the delicious meal). I finally learned what rocket is too. My mother raved about the tiramisu which surprised me since she doesn't even like tiramisu. The server was friendly, helpful, and as quick as she could be despite there not being any empty tables nearby. The restaurant wasn't insanely loud and I could hear my dinner companions just fine without shouting. I was surprised that the menu prices didn't make me want to cry (since we were picking up the tab). All in all, a wonderful place to share a meal and catch up with an old friend.",

We had the Christmas special set menu and not anywhere on the menu did it indicate that everything would have nuts in. As a nut allergy sufferer that was not a good thing. I couldn't eat most of the sharer starter, the main was a lump of chicken on the bone that I couldn't find under a mass of soggy vegetables and the one dessert I thought wouldn't have nuts in had some almonds sprinkled on top. This was not a fine dining experience it was a mass of lots of not greatly cooked produce. It is a very manly restaurant I feel, whcih reflect Jamie's style I suppose, my fiance loved it. However I shall be avoiding any of his chains in the future and I suggest you do the same if you are female and prefer quality over quantity",

It was very very good, the quality of the ingredients was really excellent, we had some of the best tomatoes I've eaten in a long time accompanying the bruschetta. I hear the lamb chop lollipops are exceptional although they'd run out when we got there (it was quite late). Service was also friendly and efficient and they have a music policy that allows the staff to pick their favourites which resulted in a great mix of songs. Highly recommended and a great addition to the west end. It goes to show that a high quality can be maintained and prices kept reasonable even for a chain restaurant.",

What works in this palce is the fact the bread is freshly baked on site, the meat is sliced to order and the cheese is of the hishest quality, the tomatos were varied and full of flavour and the dippings oils also very tasty.I would go back for sure.Jurgen",

Jamie OliverI have 3 or 4 of Jamies cookbooks and the iPad app. I've bought them as gifts for other people. I guess I'm a fan. When wandering around Covent Garden and I saw the restaurant I KNEW I was going to eat there. Coming from the US I had no idea if locals thought of this place as a tourist trap or if it was to be taken seriously--but I didn't care. We put our name in and had an Italian beer while we waited 25 mins for our table. We had polenta chips and an Italian assortment \"board\" to start and both were pretty good. I had mushroom and cheese ravioli for the main course and it was perfect. For dessert I had the ultimate brownie and my girlfriend had the pannacotta. The brownie was really good--the pannacotta was good but nothing memorable. Where they took a hit for me was the risotto my girlfriend ordered. It was crunchy! Knowing that the man has an entire chapter of TWO of his books dedicated to instructing others on risotto making--and even videos on the iPad app--I found this to be an unforgivable flaw. Everything else was good though. The service was nice. Our waiter--a little spaced out--was still nice. The setup was cute. The portions were small and I'm good with that--I left the place satisfied and not unable to walk. If I find myself back in London I'd probably give them another try.",

    "text": "I decided to spend my last weekend in the UK in London... for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee! \u00a0What a way to close three wonderful years in the UK. \u00a0On one of the nights, my fellow American expat suggested we head to Jamie's. \u00a0Splendid idea! \u00a0When we got there, the wait was about 40 minutes... normally we would probably look for another place, but it finally stopped raining, so we decided we would wait and sit in the courtyard while we waited (the little lobby/waiting area was too crowded to hang about...). \u00a0Fortunately the little pager worked that far away!Inside we were seated, but trying to get up to go to the toilet... well that was difficult because the tables on either side were so close. \u00a0In fact we were watching one table try to leave, but the guy almost took dinner off the table next to them! \u00a0I know tables can be close, but the problem is that all of them were so close that it was difficult for anyone to move a table. \u00a0For starters, Ang enjoys the Polenta Chips and I like the Funky Chips, but really wanted to try the Posh Chips. \u00a0I knew I was probably ordering pasta, so I figured an order of Posh Chips would be a cheeky... posh starter. \u00a0And since they aren't a huge portion, it would just be a taster ;)The nice thing about what we chose for starters was that they came out really quick because we were starvin' like Marvin! \u00a0However, after we had placed our orders for our mains, Ang and I noticed more than just one special... \u00a0In fact, if you looked at the boards throughout the restaurant, there was a different dish on each one! \u00a0While I was tempted to change my order, I stayed with it, but Ang asked the waitress if she could change hers. \u00a0It was nice that the waitress was able to make the change, but it would have been nicer had the waitress told us the specials or asked if we wanted to hear the specials... as most places do.The other thing about the tables being so close... you are practically a part of the next table's convo. \u00a0In this case it was a group of drunk Irish girls... potentially on a Hen Night, but a little unclear. \u00a0Things were jovial at first and then there was a phone call and... well I've never here \"feckin'\" used so much in my life... well besides watching \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\". \u00a0Ang and I were eyeing their desserts and cocktails... and they were eyeing my Posh Chips! \u00a0I tried the Polenta Chips... I'm not a fan of Polenta and while I liked the crispy bits on the outside, I didn't like the mushy, cakey bit on the inside and since they are huge blocks (not really chips), there is more mushy than crispy. \u00a0The Posh Chips were lovely, I can't say I tasted much truffle and I would have loved more cheese... it would have spared me from salting the chips.I cannot remember what Ang had for the life of me... I think it may have been a seafood dish, but she seemed to enjoy it. \u00a0I had Jools' Favourite Sicilian Tuna Fusilli. \u00a0It was good, but the whole meal wasn't quite as good as my first with the Rabbit Ragu and the salad. \u00a0The tuna kind of looked like it came out of a can, rather than fresh because it was all tiny, squidgy bits, rather than nice big flaky pieces. \u00a0I did enjoy the use of cinnamon though... after a visit to Morocco, I am loving the use of cinnamon in savoury dishes. \u00a0Because of the way the fish was, I would have preferred a more delicate pasta than the Fusilli, but it was still a satisfying dish. \u00a0We were considering dessert, especially after seeing the lovely desserts that were devoured by the girls next to us, but we were really full and knew that dessert was going to make the journey back to her house in West Ham very uncomfortable.I know Jamie is trying to change food at American schools, but while he's doing that, could he open a few restaurants here in the states... for those of us that already appreciate good quality food?! \u00a0Pretty please!",

In a last ditch attempt to gain something from the experience, I went for the tiramisu. This was solid, as if it had been frozen, and was more like an 80's Black Forest Gateau from Iceland supermarket. A simply dreadful experience, not helped by the fact that the waiter was on another planet, loping off and forgetting drinks and salads, but still managing to charge us for them! . I'm sure that if it were not for the famous name of the proprietor (who probably has never set foot in the place), it would not be as busy. Never again.",

I saw that there was a burger on the menu, and I couldn't turn the opportunity down to try it. \u00a0It was beautiful to look at, but it took a couple of moments to figure out how one would eat it. \u00a0The presentation was fantastic, but the lettuce was so so thick, that you had to cut it, and smash the lettuce down, to be able to eat it without the food ending up everywhere but your stomach. \u00a0The flavor though was not compromised by the large lettuce display. \u00a0The bread was toasted to perfection. The burger was fantastic. I would definitely go back to try some of the other offerings.",

The idea of a restaurant with Jamie's face and all his \"funky\" and \"pukka\" vocab plastered everywhere made me uncomfortable, as much as the idea that a lot of people are coming here just because of the name.But, we needed to eat, and we came across it at 17:45 on a Saturday night with a short queue. We got our buzzer, and went for a drink at a nearby pub: the pub was crap, but the bare-shirted fight with a bouncer we saw was very entertaining.After 30 minutes or so we were buzzed and came back in to sit down.I surprised myself by enjoying the food a lot - best Italian I've had for a while.Accompanied by a decent 20 quid bottle of Pinot Grigio, I had the arancini (rice balls) followed by the scallop and squid ink spaghetti. They were both delicious as was my companion's choices.OK, so they have a burger on the menu, it's a chain, and Jamie is annoying, but it would be completely pretentious of me to not recommend the food here.Our bill (including that wine remember) came to a ridiculously reasonable 65 quid.",

The staff are fantastic and their food knowledge is second to none. I like to start with the plank of mixed meat, cheese and olives. I usually go for the bolognese as an entree. It's so good that when I don't order it I feel like I'm cheating on it. The breadcrumbs, meat quality and home-made pasta really make it stand out.

We'd booked a table but got there pretty early (45 minutes) we tried to ask the woman on the front desk if we might be sat earlier or if the time couldn't be changed in which case we would have visited the nearby shops and come back. The woman barely looked at us and simply snapped that we should wait at the bar implying it may be earlier. We ended up waiting for the full 45 minutes and longer until I had to go over again and remind them I'd booked (as we'd seen people with no booking coming in and being sat whilst we were still waiting). The bar area is right near the front door, has no seating and is really cramped with no atmosphere. Once we were seated the waiting staff were much better, they were friendly and showed good knowledge of the menu. The food was its usual Jamie's standard (very good). My only criticism of the restaurant area is the seating was very cramped - you could hear everyone's conversations and you had to constantly pull your chair in to allow other customers to get in/out of their table. All in all our night got better than how it started but it was still a disappointing visit especially for a birthday meal.",

The tomato salad w/ mozz should not be served if the tomatoes aren't good! They were sour and mushy. We tried the crab bruchetta, which tasted very fishy and more like canned tuna. The sea bass was disgusting....zero flavor. Finally the flutter beef (?) was severely overcooked. The manager came out and apologized and said she saw the food and it should never have been sent out like that. I would say they do have excellent customer service. On a brighter note, the spicy prawn linguine was excellent. I'm appalled that Jamie Oliver would have his name associated with this horrendous food!!!",

Even though there are quite a few branches of Jamies' Italians around London now, the place doesn't feel like a chain (until you have been to too many of those and the crapper joke starts feeling a bit tired).The menu offers a good selection of veggie and meat dishes and the portions are just right. We all had pasta today with two of us opting for the specials of aubergine ravioli with the others sticking to standard favourites of arrabiata and bolognese. The polenta chips are a great nibble for sharing.As with all things Italian Jamie's comes into its own in Summer while the metal seats and large glass windows give you a chill on a wet and windy winter's day.",

But being a fat American, I have to say I wish I got more lamb!For the table we had a baby mozzarella and tomato salad, sweet mini chili peppers, mushroom panzerotti and the best of british lamb piedini.SO good. Salad was best \"caprese\" salad we've ever had. There were all different kinds of tomatoes, and slightly cooked so it was just the right softness/freshness. Sweet mini chili peppers were stuffed with tuna, capers and anchovies, and it was good, but for some reason I was expecting chunks of raw tuna, but was probably just canned tuna. Good anyways! You get five of these on your plate, which is quite good for being part of the \"nibble\" section.Mains - not a big mushroom person, so I won't comment about that. Lamb was amazing! I love animals parts =P The kidney shoulder leg heart and liver came out on a skewer. Delicious but so little =(My only disappointment was the biggest piece on the skewer was what looked like something wrapped in bacon - and it just turned out to be a big old piece of crouton. Sigh. I suppose that's how Jamie keeps it affordable.All of it washed down quite well with a Shiraz they had on the wine list. I also tried the Florence Fizz off their cocktail list (when we got there, we had a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday evening!) So yummy! Love fizzy fruity cocktails.All in all, great place for the price, but can't help but notice where he cut corners to make this place \"affordable\".",

I chose a chicken breast with a side of chips, the chicken was cooked to perfection and was so moist and delicious.

The meat was good and fresh but the sauce tasted not as good as expected. May I just say before continuing that my expectation was very high as I am a real foodie and really wanted to go to Jamie's. The pasta were good, the sauce was good and the prawns were very very fresh. And it wasn't one of those restaurant where you get 2 prawns, here, the plate was filled with them. Prawns with pasta, not pasta with prawns. Then, we decided to share the Ultimate Chocolate, Rasberry and Amarreto Brownie. It was incredible. The presentation was very nice, and it tasted just incredibly good. We can taste both the rasberry and the chocolate with a little bit of amarreto. it was perfectly baked and tasted perfect.

    "text": "Came here for dinner last Saturday night with my friend. We were told it would be about a 30-40 minute wait, given a beeper (they also took down my mobile number just in case) and kindly suggested we go have a drink somewhere (i.e. go away, come back when we beep you). I hate that they don't take reservations. We went down the street to grab a coffee and chat, and sure enough, in about 30 minutes our beeper went off signaling a table was ready for us! The upper level was completely packed and we were seated in the lower level, which was also packed. I actually liked it because you could peek into the kitchen. There are chalkboards with daily specials scrawled on them, and all of the walls are decorated with glass cabinets displaying wine bottles, pasta and olive oil tins. We ordered the Top Italian Bread Selection to share. It was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. I would have preferred if they have given us a plate to pour the oil and vinegar into instead of the little sauce dish. The waitress didn't pour nearly enough vinegar into the dish and for the first few mouthfuls we were eating oily bread. We ordered a bottle of Ponte Pietra 2009 Trebbiano-Garganega to accompany our pasta and fish dishes. It was light, fruity and pleasant.We shared a couple of pasta dishes as starters. The Wild Truffle Tagliatelle was absolutely amazing! I would order this again the next time I come back. It was cheesy, buttery, truffle-y and perfect. The Mushroom Panzerotti was also very delicious. The tomato sauce was sweet, a little tart and a tiny bit spicy, which adds a nice kick to the dish. For the main we had the Fish Baked in a Bag. The fish of the day was Cod, and it was perfectly cooked. It was moist, flaky and so flavourful. It is baked with mussels, clams, smashed fennel, chili, anchovy over a bed of Sicilian cracked wheat. This dish was quite spicy, but bearable.For dessert I had the tiramisu and my friend had the chocolate, raspberry and amaretto brownie. The tiramisu was good, better than some that I've had, but not overly amazing. It was a good balance of moist espresso-soaked cake layers and marscapone layers. It's delicately flavoured with orange zest and served with orange cr\u00e8me fraiche, which gave it an interesting twist. The brownie was to die for - absolutely incredible.Overall we were both very happy with the food an service. WC is located on the lower level. The ambience was fun, casual and they played an awesome mix of 80's & 90's music throughout the evening. I completely recommend this spot, and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I love, love, love Jamie's Italian. What's great: 1) Pastas! They are amazing. My favorites are Jool's Tuna Fusilli, the Pappardelle and the Tagliatelle. If you can't decide, just order 2 starter size portions so you can sample a couple different dishes :D I've heard mixed reviews from folks who have tried to order other things from the menu. I've never tried anything other than the pastas for my main, but I've had friends who have and I've heard mixed reviews like, the chicken is awesome, but the risotto is bland. Stick with the pasta, you'll be happy!2) Antipasta Meat Platter!! A must have as a starter. They bring out a giant board portioned according to how many people are at your table. The board is filled will wonderful meats, cheese, olives, etc. Delicious. 3) Casual atmosphere. You don't need reservations unless you have a really large group. Just show up and they will get you a table as soon as possible. Note: It is pretty busy on Fri - Sun, so get there early or you'll be in a queue for an hour. When the weather is nice, I like getting a drink at the bar and waiting in the outside patio until a table is ready.4) Reasonable prices.",

    "text": "This visit to Jamie's Italian was my second (I'd previously been to the one in Birmingham and wasn't impressed) was for my friends birthday. We chose from the Christmas set menu and were not disappointed. We were seated promptly and served quickly. When we sat down our starters (antipasti) were already waiting for us and they were delicious. Made even better when they delivered to us a glass of prosecco each and some deep fried and parmesan covered gnocchi! For the main I had Genaro's porchetta which was a lovely big piece of rolled and stuffed pork belly with roast vegetables and polenta \"chips\" on the side. Dessert was a lemon meringue cheese cake cake was also great. I highly recommend this restaurant. It really doesn't feel like a chain restaurant and it is ideally placed for lunch while out shopping or dinner before a trip to the theatre",

I've come here for both lunch and dinner and been pleasantly surprised. I've had everything from pasta to salad to one if their hamburgers and always been happy with my order. There is also a little shop where you can buy some of his stuff - anything from cook books to kitchen ware.

    "text": "4-star food in an otherwise mediocre joint. (Sorry, Jamie!)I really like the way Jamie Oliver cooks: get good, fresh food, prepare it simply, let it shine. Not too fussy, not too proper. My kind of cooking. And despite it being an Italian restaurant in the tourist district of London, I was willing to give it a shot on name alone.As far as I can tell, everyone's mains were good. No michelin stars here, but fresh ingredients, prepared simply, shining on their merits. If only the mains were the whole of the thing.The appetizers tried too hard, or didn't try at all. We ordered a few rounds Bruschetta and got these longboards of bread topped in a variety of ways, but none really hit the mark. The bread was soggy, suggesting they'd been waiting for a while. The toppings were chilled like they'd come out of a fridge, even when that tightened up the flavour. The calamari was nothing to write home about. The olives were a stand out there, prepared simply and delicious.Drinks were similarly a mess. The disappointing two beers on offer weren't surprising in an italian joint, but the bar was not much better. A syrupy negroni for one friend and a pretty weak mojito for the other. Clearly we were being driven towards the wine list but that, too, was pretty one-note. Giant super-tuscans might be the thing that sells tourists, but it's hard for me to believe Jamie couldn't find a single medium bodied offering from Piemonte, say, if only for variety.Here's the lowdown: the downstairs dining area is nice, and a bit quieter. The mains are really rockin'. If you are careful to order the appetizers that hew to the mantra of \"fresh ingredients prepared simply\" like, say, the olives, you can do well there, too. If you call ahead to avoid the wait, you can have a 4-star night here. But there are places in London where the default is a 4- (or 5!) star night and they don't make you work so hard for it.Pro-tip: order the truffled fries. I don't care that they aren't italian. Find the chump at your table who's ordering a steak, and steal his truffled fries. I'll distract him. Go!",
