The food is excellent and you will want three coures - though you may not make it! The wine list is also impressive and reasonably priced for the West End. Book a table when you are able to spend the whole evening enjoying the restaurant, this is very definitely not a pre-threatre eatery.",

The service was impeccable and the atmosphere vibrant, relaxed and unstuffy. However, the food was disappointing, and I suspect that this was just maybedue to the lateness of the hour. My duck was a sort of lukewarm pink blotting paper and had perhaps been hanging around for some time, and the accompanying Mashed potatos were very poor; dry and tired. The real let down was the creme brulee - a signature dish for this restaurant at my previous visit. The brulee was granular uncooked sugar and the creme was very runny and just not right., Don't know the answer, but I suspect this was the end of a long day; however the prices were still up there, and it's a real pity the food wasn't.Tiredness manifests itself in many ways, and I would recommend the management take a careful look at the late offerings. Sorry guys.",

After our meal, we went downstairs for coffee before going home, which was equally very nice. All in all we had a fabulous evening and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Langan's to anyone.

The location, reputation and appearance of the restaurant would leave anyone to expect a stuffy, formal interior. On the contrary, I found the staff friendly and the atmosphere casual and relaxed. The restaurant is large, and although the decor is somewhat dated in places, the walls are crammed with an impressive art collection. The food is traditional, hearty English fare - don't be surprised to hear the phrase \"My mother made it just like that\". The roast duck (a huge portion) was outstanding, as were the grilled swordfish and sirloin steak (hey, that's what I was told). The extensive menu is hand-written and changes frequently. You can see a sample on the restaurant's website. langansrestaurants.co.uk  All in all, a great place to take your parents for dinner.",

The staff are excellent, and it is run very well. Service has always been very good and that is why people keep going back. The menu could probably do with a shake up more often than it is, although the daily dated menu card is a nice touch....even if it does look like something from the 70's....which it probably is ! The last few times I've been there, the food has not been great. Fish and Chips....very greasy, Sausage and Mash....very stodgy........the seafood is usually very good, and the field mushrooms with lancashire cheese is still a great starter A good wine list, and overall I think it is priced fairly, considering where it is. The atmosphere is always great, with a great mix of people from every walk of life. I find lunchtimes is best it is usually very lively, and the people watching is very entertaining ! It's not unusual to have a 1.00pm lunch reservation, and be sitting in the bar at 5.00pm Well worth a visit, for the atmosphere alone, just don't expect too much from the food.....",

That is not meant to be unkind but reflect the happening bustle busy style of informal dining. Good food, friendly staff, good portions reasonable prices in a very \"Happening environment I like the art, bit's and bobs on the walls, I think it works well. It's not fine dining, but it's also a long way from fine dining prices, I think it is modestly, very modestly priced. Many restaurants could learn an awful lot from Langans in respect of good quality, fresh, food served in an un-pretentious.... but nice restaurant by helpful staff. I think they do it well. I remember the glory day's when \"The chef\" Richard Shepherd was in the kitchen and I feel it was better. (Maybe that's just a romantic view in time who knows) Don't get me wrong not saying it's not good, just think Richard Shepherd knew his way around a chopping board. One of the huge advantage of having on board great Caterers like Shepherd is that They have done the mileage, been about, learnt the job Not a lot of people gonna teach the likes of Richard Shepherd a lot about food and restaurants. I hear he is pretty much semi retired nowadays but no doubt still has a guiding hand. Now after all that boring waffle, and praise in support of Langans and Richard Shepherd i went on to the web site to have a look before posting this review. I have to say (Sorry about this guys) they have one of the most boring, boring web site i have ever had the missfortune to visit. Sorry guys but it's true. Don't let this put you off because it is no reflection of Langans whatsoever! I'm just guessing they are so busy, don't give a hoot about the web site....because they don't really neeed it? Who knows. Lastly, one great thing about Langans...they will always try and fit you in, late at night, very late at night, if they can get you in, always do their best. If you have not already tried Langans, in respect of value for money, good food and fun easy nice times, try it. Cannot believe you will be unhappy, certainly for the very reasonable cost. I like it, i think it's great.",

Indeed, there didn't seem to be many vegetarian-friendly dishes apart from sides and salads, but other than that there should be plenty to choose from for everyone.The quality of the service was fairly standard, and prices were quite reasonable by London standards.

    "text": "Recommended by a friend who grew up in London as his favorite traditional London spot. \u00a0Arrived with my family and were seated at a table that was next to a large table that was soon filled with loud business types who were yelling across the table to one another. \u00a0After asking to be moved, they sat us up in a nice quiet table and our meal began. \u00a0Drinks were nicely prepared and the service was excellent. \u00a0The food for all was tasty and well prepared, from fish dishes to bangers and mash for our youngest. \u00a0Our son has a nut allergy and they were extremely careful to ensure that he ordered nothing with any allergens - including the cocktail that he ordered! \u00a0This is a wonderful and traditional restaurant with great attention to detail and excellent food. \u00a0One of our fondest memories from our time in London.",

A few minutes after our food arrived we found a hair in our fries to which the manager refused to accept that there was an actual hair in our fries. Obviously I can differentiate between a human hair and things found in a kitchen. Very disappointed, came here expecting great service and quality food but got the exact opposite.",

    "text": "My Father first took me to this establishment when I was so small I didn't even know who Michael Caine was, but my Dad certainly did, in fact I believe because Michael C. was then one of the owners, dear long gone Father who - I since learnt - never ever missed a Caine Film, was probably hoping to see the great man himself hoeing into Bangers and Mash. On that day, sadly, for Dad, I believe it was a case of 'No appearance your Worship!'Nevertheless, over the years, from the time I was a mere copy-girl who knew absolutely nothing about hacking into celebrity's phones, till later in life when I learned that in order to get information out of 'political suspects' you had to ply them with grub and booze and then sort out the mash in their brains from the chips on their shoulders, I was a very frequent customer at Langan's for lunch.In those days the fish was great, the steaks were lean and well cooked - and the staff, considering they were mostly English, were a reasonably friendly lot. Which means, of course, they were allowed to drink on the job.Unlike the branch that Caine opened in Century City in Los Angeles, a city where service is first - before they even know if they have any fish or potatoes left - so, in those days, for London, the Langan's Mayfair Flagship location wasn't really too bad at all.Sadly, when I was there last - which was only a few months back, I suffered a disgusting culture shock. To use the word 'deterioration' would only be praising this once admirable eatery. Paper on tables instead of real table cloths, no sign of 'Caine' and the staff were very far removed from being even slightly 'Able' and the lights definitely so bright and strong they surely had to be nicked from a movie set - and, as for the food, well, I can't find in the three different dictionaries I prowled through, any words stronger than 'deplorable, disgusting and 'orrible' to describe it. That is without delving into expletives not becoming of any lady of the day or night!I'm sure the talented Michael Caine removed himself from the owners list long ago, because no 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrel' I know would want to own this place now. In fact, if I thought I could get my money back from my badly- battered fish and soggy, micro-waved chips, I'd 'Get Carter' in a flash.",

For dessert, I ordered the Treacle tart with ice cream. \u00a0I had no idea what this was and my Britsh counterparts were howling that that I was going to lose a tooth, pulled out by the Treacle. \u00a0Needless to say, my teeth are intact and I quite enjoyed this dessert.Again a very nice place for a business dinner or some other large gathering.",
