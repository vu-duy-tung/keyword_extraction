Delicious mains and a fine selection of wines. The staff are personable and an added touch is the series of staff portraits dating from the sixties that adorn the walls. If you haven't yet ventured into Grumbles I guarantee your palate (if not your wallet - it's a bit pricey!) will appreciate it!",

    "text": "Grumbles is one of the many restaurants in my neighborhood, and I have been a few times which is saying something, and each time I was not disappointed. The first time was with a girlfriend and we had a delicious Sauvignon Blanc from their great, yet affordable wine list. We had mains only, since the bread and olives presented upon arrival was a sufficient starter. the 95p charged to the bill to cover these was well worth it. I had the fish pie and she the filet. We were both thoroughly impressed. I will say I am an American transplant and this was my first experience with a fish pie and am officially now a fan. My friend ordered her filet with mash and cooked medium rare and she got just that. Which is nice considered how many places do not get medium rare right around here!On our most recent visit we did a pre-theatre dinner as we were actually going to the theatre. \u00a0Upon arrival we were informed the chef was in traffic and running late and it might be a while, but when we indicated we were going to the theatre we were assured that we would be served in plenty of time and we were. Three delicious courses later we were on our way to a show at 7:05. I must say three courses for 13.50 each in of itself was a feat. To start I had the beet, green bean and goat cheese salad and my husband had the cream of tomato soup (see photos). Both were delicious. Next I had the fish cake with greens and he had the pork belly with mash. My fishcake was perfectly assembled with chives, mash and fish (though I would have preferred a bit more fish). The pork belly, wasn't exactly what we were expecting, but then we weren't exactly sure what pork belly was. \u00a0I think my husband wished he had ordered the fish cake. But the topper of the night was the two apple pancakes, served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and strawberries. It really made me glad I hadn't eaten that waffle on Oxford Street I was considering that afternoon. \u00a0Because this was heaven on a plate, if you only come for one thing make it desert and a glass of wine.",

However, the food is a major disappointment and it's very overpriced to boot for what you get.We ordered a Haloumi salad with Mediterranean vegetables and the red lentil soup which was one of the days specials. The salad was a good idea in principle, but instead of a traditional Mideastern salad, I got what amounted to olive oil soup with a few overcooked vegetables; it was absolutely drenched in oil and rather disgusting. It was also not fresh and was clearly sitting in a fridge for some time. The actual red lentil soup was nice but not out of the ordinary.The service was pretty good and again, it felt like a great place to have a drink or something. But I don't think I'd go back for the food.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I came here for dinner our first night in town. Grumbles was more of something that we chose after discovering that many places in London get booked up ahead of time for dinner, particularly on weekends. Getting seated was easy enough (we got a nice outdoors seat on a quiet street), and the service overall was okay.That said, the food was a bit disappointing, more so after getting some context around what else is available here in the UK. The best part about dinner was the appetizer, which was the seared scallops with watercress dressing. The scallops were cooked to just the right texture, and the dressing provided a light flavoring that accentuated their taste. The main courses though were disappointing. My girlfriend got fish and chips and was disappointed to get beer-battered fish that was unimaginative in taste and had plain tartare sauce to dip it in. I had the signature filet steak at grumbles, but it was overcooked (at least medium despite a request of medium-rare), and the marinade of English mustard and brown sugar would have been delicious...if applied more evenly. In quite a few spots there was way too much, and the reaction my taste buds had was not too dissimilar from that which one has after receiving a surprise dose of wasabi with their sushi - way, way too hot in certain instances. The side of mashed potatoes were hand-made but had to be the most flavorless potatoes I've had - I don't think any salt or butter were added at all.It's a nice little spot in the neighborhood, but the 50 pounds that the entire meal cost for the both of us was a bit on the steep side. I would probably try something else if I came back (or at least something that better reflects the value).",

    "text": "Only a day after arriving to London and we already found Grumbles. I'd say in general this was a wonderful restaurant for its food and atmosphere. For starters my wife and I shared a prawns and avocado dish. The ingredients were pretty fresh and ample yet I couldn't get over how the sauce drenched everything and tasted exactly like McDonald's special fry sauce.My wife had the fish and chips which was excellent: crisp, not greasy and warm. I had the leek and onion creamy risotto which was excellent and even felt refreshing on this warm summer night.Lastly, my only cautionary tale is about the service. I concede this could be an American perception however the problem is that our server removed our uneaten bread, butter and olives between appetiser and entree courses without a word or question. I'd say that since we paid 95p for those thing that we're entitled to enjoy them fully. Next meal we'll have to watch everything on the table carefully.",

We ordered the chicken salad and the fish and chips and were not disappointed! The setting is intimate. It was full when we got there but seating cleared as the evening went on. \u00a0It's nice to just sit and enjoy a meal and leave when you're ready. Another nice feature I didn't want to forget to mention was the music. Playlist was a kind of Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, Dean Martin tribute. Very nice!",

    "text": "After a very long day of navigating the London Underground, Portobello Rd, more underground (how dare they close the line we need on the day we're here?!), a nice quiet dinner was very much needed.Enter Yelp. \u00a0The very first restaurant I looked at was Grumbles. \u00a0A short walk from our hotel, check. \u00a0Review/, positive. \u00a3\u00a3 = \"moderate price\", and so off we go. It really IS a 5 minute walk! At 7:30 PM we were fortunate to get the last 2 topper table although I'm assuming there's a back room because people went in and never came back out.I was still not quite ready for dinner, so I ordered the soup of the day, cream of broccoli and an appetizer, which was 3 large scallops on a bed of butternut squash and a top of pancetta. \u00a0My husband ordered the rocket (arugula to us Americans) and Parmesan salad, and a lamb taggine dish. \u00a0Everything came out piping hot, well prepared and delicious. \u00a0We shared a crumble for dessert, raspberry and apple with a topping and then we poured cream over. \u00a0Again, piping hot and positively delectable.After an insanely busy day eating crowds, figuring out the London Underground, and walking our poor legs into mere sticks, this quiet, well modulated dinner was just what we needed. \u00a0In closing, we should have asked the reason this restaurant is named Grumbles. \u00a0It should be \"Compliments\" because I'm sure that's what everyone does who eats here!",

They do a good value set menu (2 courses for around \u00a312 I believe), the food is decent and the service friendly and quick.The interior is farmhouse-meets-church: the front door is thick varnished wood, with a mixture of benches that could have come straight from the pews of a nearby chapel. Thick candles add to the effect (there's no incense mind! Or organ-playing) and on the walls are old black and white prints circa turn of the 20th century. The crowd tend to be predominantly older residents of Belgravia, with the occasional tourist and nearby office worker.Overall, a dependable spot to get lunch or dinner.",

I was given bread and olives and noted the lack of flair in the free snacks.The menu looks like it has some promise...I opted for the green and white asparagus w/ quail egg and truffle aioli. BIG MISTAKE. I'd have to say this is probably one of the worst, most ill-conceived plates I've had in most of my life. There was no synergy, no quality, and one out of three of the quail eggs was runny. It was as if I was in a nightmare where someone who had never cooked before decided to feed me. Yes, it was that bad..and also 7 quid. The aioli was a viscous, tasteless mess.Then I was \"treated\" to a fishpie topped with whipped potatoes. While not as hellish as the aforementioned \"Nightmare on Churton Street\" it did little to assuage the tragedy on my tongue after the first course. Whatever fish was inside was no doubt of little quality, the gravy around it was flavorless, and the potatoes on top were created in such a way that appeared to be anathema to the art of cooking. This was bland on a new level.All this for the palty sum of 22 pounds (after \"optional service\" which felt odd, because I definitely didn't receive any..)\"Eek! Methinks not\" indeed.",

The place is small and historic, and the seating is a bit uncomfortable as the neighbouring tables almost lock you inside your seat for the duration of your meal. They are tight on space but that's not really surprising for London. I decided on the trout and got a salad as an appetizer. The food was prepared fast and fresh and you can definitely taste the quality of the food - a solid 3 stars. My trout tasted more like salmon, but it was still good nonetheless. However, I found this place to be extremely pricey. Not uncommon in Europe, but they charge an automatic 1-2 pound 'cover' for the table bread and olives...which is always a bit of a surprise when the bill comes.",

    "text": "We both really enjoyed our dinner here. It was our last sit-down meal in London before moving on to the next city. When we arrived, the dining room upstairs was warm and packed. The first employee we met said we could wait for a few minutes for a table near the door to clear out, or we could find a spot to eat downstairs, where it was less crowded.Down the stairs we went! The basement seating area is a lot cozier than the dining room upstairs, which was totally fine for us. It was quiet - only one other party was seated when we entered - and it was warm. They have a bar, and food is transported from the kitchen via dumbwaiter (something I find so charming about London restaurants!) For dinner, I went with the chicken breast (it came smothered in cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus), and my husband went with the Moroccan lamb tagine. We ordered a couple of pints to round out our meal.The food was very good. We didn't have to wait long for the dumbwaiter to ding, announcing the arrival of our meals. My plate didn't look like much - I mean really, you can't make a dish smothered in wine sauce and cheese look pretty - but the flavors were definitely there. The chicken was grilled separately, then topped with the mushrooms, white wine sauce, and asparagus, before the melted cheese was added. As a final touch, they torched the cheese to give it a bit more oompf, which absolutely added to the flavor profile.My husband was pleasantly surprised by the quality of his own meal. The lamb was served on a bed of couscous, with vegetables and a cool yogurt dip on the side. He managed to destroy the plate in record time, though at one point he did pull something that looked suspiciously like a human hair out of the plate. He managed to convince himself it wasn't a hair, though, and almost licked the plate clean.And because we weren't full enough, we decided to order dessert. Last night in London, have to make it special, right? They didn't have sticky toffee pudding on the menu, so we went with the lime cheesecake. It was tasty (and definitely the prettiest presentation of food that night). The lime was offset by a mango sauce, which helped balance the tartness. The only reason I've taken off a star is the fact that our waitress - who was responsible only for the downstairs area (all two parties) - wasn't very attentive. The party behind us kept having to call her over to ask for more water, more wine, status on their meals and to ask for the dessert menu. We weren't quite as vocal, but we did have to flag her down a few times throughout the night, as well. The last time I tried to get her attention, she was on her phone...Despite all that, the food was excellent and we left feeling full and fuzzy. Had it not been our last night in town, we definitely would have gone back for another meal.",

Huge portion and the gravy was thick and delicious. Nice wine selection. Also had a pate as a first course and a cheese plate for dessert. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal. We were part of a large group, so we ate downstairs. A bit cramped, so try and eat upstairs, if you can. A fine place to experience good quality English fare.",

Sadly, the entrees just weren't very tasty (fish pie and mullet with potatoes), and the tables are super tight and awkward. \u00a0We did enjoy the music they had playing.",

I had a shrimp and avocado starter. It was much more generous than I expected. Our main dishes were vegetable lasagne and Moroccan lamb tagine: both very good, although I would have preferred more spice to the tagine. Nice wine list. We would definitely return. Reservations are highly recommended.",

Which was fine, but as I left I saw people walking in and getting seated. Btw there were open tables in the place. Sorry if my singleness offends you. My money spends just as good, which I took around the corner to a place that was happy to see me.",

No where on the menu description was curry mentioned and the entire entree taste of curry. It was disappointing as the only food I was not in the mood for was Indian. My mother had the chicken with avocado and really enjoyed it. I tried a bite and was underwhelmed. They do not have a beer menu in the basement so I was under the impression they did not serve beer. I saw other patron drinking beer so I was a bit confused. Grumbles is okay.",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for Grumbles since most reviews were very good to excellent, but I came out a little disappointed!Firstly I would say I love the rustic interior and thought the meal would be some delicious rustic, comfort food to match the decor. I ordered the snails and the fish pie whilst my friend ordered the prawns in garlic and chili and the burger with fries. The snails were lovely and so were the prawns, so far so good with the starters! If we had left at that point Grumbles would have had top marks but we were hungry and had mains! Firstly my fish pie, it was very blend and didn't taste as if the mash potatoes and the fish had come across any seasoning. I added salt and pepper and it was fine. My friend barely ate any of her burger as the whole plate, in contrast with mine, was just pure salt! The waitress though was lovely and asked why she hadn't eaten any of her burger and when my friend explained, she offered to order another dish. They handled this situation very well and that I was very pleased with.",

    "text": "Solid three stars. The atmosphere is lovely - a surprisingly cosy, nice place to sit and enjoy a leisurely meal. And I do mean leisurely - no one took our order for 40 minutes! And it took us about 15-20 minutes to order tea/coffee after our dishes were cleared. The food was good, not great. Well, actually - some dishes were great and others were pretty bad. It seemed very hit or miss; my scallop appetiser was delicious but overpriced (\u00a39 for 3 small scallops), but my salad was pretty bad: it was slathered in a very strong mustard dressing to the point that I couldn't taste anything else, with the exception of saltiness from the otherwise tasteless halloumi. My dessert (vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and almonds) was served very prettily and was rich and yummy. It was just a shame that my main was so bad. Other comments from my table included:\"Well, a fish pie is a fish pie, so it was fine.\"\"My shrimp appetiser was amazing!\"and \"The creme brulee was alright.\"Basically, it's not a place I'd seek out.. but I also wouldn't be against giving it another try if I was in the area. Just a matter of hit or miss on the dishes.",
