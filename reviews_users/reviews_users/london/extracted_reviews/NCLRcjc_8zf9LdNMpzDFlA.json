    "text": "Ever since the owner of a Michelin starred Central London restaurant referred Asadal to me, I've been a fan! This Korean restaurant is one of my top choices for spicy East Asian cuisine. The kimchi here is delicious as a side dish or as an ingredient to kimchi chi gae (kimchi and pork in a spicy broth with rice for \u00a39) or kimchi bokum bab (fried rice with kimchi and beef for \u00a37.50). The bokum bab is especially tasty and (as are all the dishes here) is served as a massive portion. Of course, with gorgeously presented dishes such as the sizzling, cook-at-your-table bi bim bab, there are plenty of other tempting options if you're not up for such a kimchi-centric meal. Now, to be honest, I haven't been to very many Korean restaurants in London, but this one's the best I've come across so far. Asadal's menu seems pretty authentic too. There are always plenty of Koreans dining (in fact, they usually make up more than half the patrons). That's gotta say something about the quality and authenticity of the food, right? Asadal is a cool place for a meal as well. Down a long set of stairs on the side of Holborn Station, it's the sort of hole in the wall establishment you can walk by a million times before noticing. Once inside, Asadal's huge dining space provides a dark and fairly swank oasis from the hustle and bustle above. Service can be frustratingly variable here, but I must say that when they get it right the food is served incredibly fast and the staff are more than willing to make up for any mix ups. If you're up for some Korean spice, you can't go wrong with Asadal.",

I've walked past the sign for Asadal numerous times when heading in and out of the Holborn station but because it looked a little discrete (basically just a door leading down to the basement restaurant) I was a bit hesitant to try it out not having much to go on (like the look of the restaurant.) I'm glad I've tried it out though if only to satisfy my curiosity about the place. Its menu offerings are pretty typical and therefore probably, to the inexperienced, a little baffling in just what to order, how much etc. If you have a good waiter they will explain the concept to you, if not you could be left floundering. We sampled a wide variety of dishes including dumplings, pancakes, some stir fry dishes and most importantly the barbecue. We made sure to choose marinated meats and they were pretty good though I felt that because it was up to the waiters/waitresses to cook the meat they should have really explained what they were doing, how long we could expect to wait for the meat, whether we could help ourselves and turn over the meat/cook it (as for a bit of a stretch of time I could see the meat over-cooking when they left us alone for a bit.) Overall I would say I was fairly satisfied with the meal though not excited.",

    "text": "Korean BBQ is always a treat, and Asadal seems to be a popular place to indulge in the tasty, marinated meats and other tasty Korean dishes. Even though this place is located extremely central, it's easy to miss since it's down a narrow staircase located between a coffee shop and a small newsagents just out from the ever bustling Holborn tube. It's a lot bigger than you'd imagine as the restaurant opens up into a dining area, divided into different sections by a number of screens, some sections more private than others. The menu is pretty standard with lots of the usual Korean dishes. I thought our pajon (seafood pancakes) was a very generous serve with probably eight or nine different sections, although I wasn't a very big fan of the dumpling soup probably because I had expected more like a wonton soup, but obviously Korean dumplings aren't exactly like that. They brought a portable cooker to the table, and as great as it was watching and smelling the meats cooking, it was a little bit too close to both of us dining, and the short sleeves shirts we wore did little to protect us from the sizzling nature of the dish. It doesn't help that having the cooker on top of the table means that the splatter goes everywhere. I have to say that one small room for improvement these guys should do is to heat up the cooker before they place the meat on the grill as it's really unappetising to see meat just stewing when it really should be grilling nicely. A nice place that I'd probably go back to but I still prefer Ran over these guys.",

Cons: Ban chans are disappointing \u00a0I want cucumbers marinated, not rough chopped then topped with hot sauce. The kim chi is disappointing, missing the sweet-sour-spicy nuances that a solid kim chi experiences proffers. Portions are too small for what they charge. And worst of all? Charging \u00a31 per cup of tea. Really? I mean, really? Plus, our group ran up a healthy tab and had placed additional orders. As we were awaiting our food, and even though there was no queue waiting for our table, we were asked about 15 times by several different waitstaff whether we were finished. It's disruptive to be asked over and over again; waitstaff should be better coordinated with each other. If you aren't looking for atmosphere and are willing to stomach a dive in exchange for much better cuisine and service, try Assa near Tottenham Ct Rd. You may go home reeking of kim chi and bbq, but your stomach will thank you.",

After we had asked to order 3 times we finally got the \"only person who can take orders\" to come to the table to take our order. When we ordered our drinks a beer came with a glass but apparently a coke doesn't merit one- that took 2 requests to resolve. We ordered some barbecue that involved wrapping the meat and other components in a lettuce leaf. Pretty quickly our hands were sticky, all requests for something to wipe our hands with were refused. Having finished the main course the plates were cleared but the table left covered in small bits of food which we had to ask them to clean. We had to ask for dessert and were given only 1 menu for 2 people. The bill arrived before the dessert and I told them to take the service off the bill, something that I don't think I've done in the last 5 years in London. I would only go here if you enjoyed being treated rudely, something is clearly wrong with the staff.",

    "text": "Over the last few years, I have regularly met with friends and family from Korea, China, United States, and Europe at the ASADAL restaurant. Now we meet at the new ASADAL at Holborn tube station. We are always craving its great and high quality Korean food, but also to share time together in an atmosphere that reminds us of Korea. For some of my friends and family, it is their first exposure to Korean food, others are really connoisseurs but invariably ASADAL is definitely our favourite Korean restaurant. There are a wide variety of dishes available. Some of our favourite dishes are: Starter:  Japchae (sweat potato /glass noodles with stir-fried vegetables) Handmade mandu (dumplings) Nice and almost crispy Pacheon (Korean pancake) Sae-woo-twe-gim \u00a0delicious type of King Tiger prawns and vegetable tempura to dip in a special sauce Kan-poong-gi \u00a0sweet and spicy fried chicken Side-dishes:  Homemade Kimchi Oh-ee-kimchi (cucumber kimchi) Kak-doo-gi (radish kimchi) Modum-na-mool a set of three seasoned vegetables with sesame oil: spinach, pickled horseradish, and bean sprout Main course:  Bibimpap (they have several varieties: normal, with raw meat or raw fish) and you can ask the level of spiciness  Our favourite is the creamy sundubu chigae (soft tofu soup with seafood) or kimchi chigae (kimchi soup) Bulgogi (Korean barbecue). It is even better with Sang-chu that's the fresh leaves of lettuce and Korean bean paste Dak-galbi, that's the spicy marinated chicken with vegetables that they cook at your table Dessert:  Fresh fruits always cut in a special way Children (and adults) also enjoy ice cream  Alternatively, they have the sik hae or Korean sweet rice punch Note that ASADAL also accommodates for our vegetarian friends. It is easily identifiable on the menu, but to make sure I always notify the waiter/waitress. The restaurant can accommodate large crowds. It is possible to eat within the intimacy of our own group of people at a very large table. There are dividers and even free private rooms. ASADAL is a child-friendly place. Children love tasting the food, especially when there is a large table full of different dishes and they can pick and choose what they like in the portion that suits them. ASADAL has special seats, small forks and small spoons for children, and the staff are always happy to help. They also have facilities to change the babies. There is a place near the table to place the buggy or other luggages. It is much larger than it appears from the outside and it is easily accessible for families and people with mobility difficulties as there is a lift. I heartily recommend it, as it is our favourite restaurant!!!",

Located at basement-level two doors from the Holborn tube station, I was initially skeptical about this place, but I was desperate for Korean food and we were in the neighborhood (which seems to have a dearth of proper restaurants), so we decided to chance it. It was a real find. The decor is stylish without being cutting edge trend, a big step up from most Korean restaurants in London. More importantly, the food is tasty -- from the bulgogi to the pajun to the kimchi jigae to the ojingo bokeum to the side dishes. The only dish I have had that I could not recommend is the mandoo.",

Because even though the rest of the place was empty we had a booking for 20 people and they insisted we could only order from the set menu. Yes that's right; rather than put more staff on, knowing we were coming, they instead chose to prepare our food in advance.They needn't have bothered really. None of it was nice anyway.Some weird soup with small pieces of scallop in it constituted scallop soup.Some sushi shared on 2 plates for a table of 7 people, making it impossible for everyone to try what was on it.Kimchee that seems to have been made in a hurry with giant leaves rolled around each other, and isn't that nice anyway.Mixed seafood again on a shared plate, and about as far from fresh as you can imagine. In fact it was so poor I couldn't bring myself to eat it.And what was for dessert? Some slices of fruit, again not enough to go round.And how much did we end up paying for this rubbish? Close to \u00a340 each once the cost of a small bottle of beer each and a service charge was added to the bill.If you want Korean food in Holborn, go round the corner and queue up for Kimchee instead.

    "text": "Horrible service, mediocre food and bad value for money. Would have given 0 if i could. Came here to meet a friend for dinner on a Friday night. We ordered a few meat bbq dishes and a fried rice to share. First, the meat portions were really small for the price, and the quality was just mediocre. The sirloin was way too salty, and while the gal bi was better, it still didn't worth half the price we were getting charged for it. The fried rice tasted ok but again not worth the price.I know that sometimes, the price you pay do include the rent and atmosphere that the restaurant offer, and i really could have forgiven the mediocre food if the service wasn't so bad. First, this lady gave us attitude when we asked if we could keep a menu so we could order more. We were refused, and brushed off like we were asking her for free appetizers. When the food came, the waiters and waitresses dropped by whenever they liked and prodded at our food with zero care. I know it's busy, but could they at least try not to throw the tongs down after they're done prodding? The horrible service continued consistently until the end when we got our bills. The 3 of us were paying by cash, and we each put in a 20 for a bill that came to 39. We thought it was obvious that we needed some change, but nope, after 2 minutes, we got one of the 20 back. When we asked for change, the guy gave us a very nasty look and muttered something audible but korean that I'm sure was inappropriate.",

A small meal cost me \u00a320, and it was just white rice with some bulgogi.Also, the servers didn't seem to talk much. For my bulgogi, they set up the portable bbq grill on my table and with the food, then just left. After about 5 minutes, I started to just cook the food myself, and they rushed over saying \"Nonono,\" and started cooking for me. Very awkward.More awkwardness: after I paid, they gave me back \u00a315 worth of coins, because they said they ran out of bills.",

Slight different to the other Korean restaurant I've tried out in the past. The service was however very slow. Where we were seated, it was even more difficult to get the waitress attention!The starters were what I expected. The bbq dishes were ok. When the main arrived, we were all very disappointed! As a restaurant specialised in Korean food, bimbimbap dolsot should be the most easiest food to make. It relies heavily on the chilli paste and core ingredients. Rather than a stone bowl full of beef, veg & rice, it was a bowl full or beansprouts & rice. We couldn't taste the beef, nor the veg! I make a better bimbimbap than Asadal! We ordered some fried seafood noodles as well... again where's the seafood but the plate was filled with beansprouts and a few strands of noodles.I'm really disappointed with this restaurant. I make a better Korean dinner party at home than this restaurant! I would not recommend anyone to go there. The 1 star is for the starters but otherwise, everything was a let down.",

I ate here for lunch on a Sat. and ordered one of their boxed lunch meals. I ordered the spicy pork bulgogi. It came with Korean white rice, 2 fried dumplings, 2 fried butterfly shrimp, moo kimchee, side salad, and Meso soup. The meal was fantastic. The pork was very tender and well cooked, with a lot of flavor. The shrimp and dumplings were also very good. The lunch meal was 12.50. I also ordered a side dish of Kimchee. 6 pds extra. It came with Cucumber, moo, & cabbage kimchee. The moo and cucumber kimchee was very good, the cabbage kimchee was ok. I prefer it a little sweeter than what they served, but I still ate it all. The decor was very pleasing and modern. Very clean. I rated it a four due to the price. 18.50 for lunch is a bit pricey. This place is right outside the Holborn tube station on the High Holborn side. I walked right by it the first time. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "I agree with the previous diners that the alacarte menu for dinner is pretty small and expensive and not really good value for money but the lunchtime menu is pretty reasonably priced actually. I'm just going to judge it on that today! (my previous trips for dinner left me not full! LOL) I took my cousin and 2 family friends to try korean fare since it was a chilly day. It was a friday and lunchtimes was surprisingly busy, mainly filled with asian clientele, which is definitely a good sign. The waiter was very efficient, taking the time to listen to us because we couldn't decide. we eventually ordered 2 kimchi jigae, 1 yukhwei bibimbap, 1 spicy pork dish and some pajeon-korean pancake. I love that the banchan comes with the lunch price, and had a lot more selection in comparison to assa, down the road. The kimchi was very nice and so was the kelp. Seasoning was quite good on all the side dishes. The kimchi jigae was very filling, and it was very flavourful so that was a win. the bibimbap was massive, my cousin couldn't finish it all, but she loved it. If you're not a fan of the sight of raw meat. don't order this. But if not, try it, because the stone pot really cooks it and it's delicious. The spicy pork was massive, and my friend really enjoyed it. Bill came to about \u00a315 a head including drinks and we just had tea. There is also complimentary fruit after your meal which is a nice touch!I realise now that \u00a315 a head for lunch is pretty expensive, but the dishes were massive, they filled you up for about \u00a310 and that's pretty good value to me. I've been an occasional customer of theirs for 5 years and i have to say, the most recent has been one of my better trips. Another plus point, its right next to the tube station and its a great spot to take overseas visitors to lunch because you can get the tube straight to oxford circus/leicester square/marble arch etc.",

    "text": "Went back to the stylish Asadal buried deep underground by Holborn station. To the untrained eye this has all the hallmarks of being a hidden treasure but sadly, it isn't. I ordered the following:- Oxtail soup- KimchiThe dishes arrived in a timely manner and look the part. The soup, a cream coloured cloud devoid of any impurities floating on the surface and the kimchi, a wrapped up ball of reddened Chinese leaves. The appearance comfortably outdoes the flavours however. The oxtail soup, which is meant to be on the subtler side lacks the richness that bone boiled soups need. As a lover of things such as congee, I know how to appreciate delicate flavours but this tasted of water. I've been in situations such as this before and often even a touch of table salt can improve things, bringing out the tastes that are there but the tables have no salt. The dish also comes with three paltry, plain pieces of beef and no oxtail which is unforgivable. The kimchi, while not a disaster is distinctly average and thoroughly lacking in spice. It also felt as if it had been served prematurely as if not fermented long enough which was a shame.One other comment relates to the customer service. I'm not a believer in the notion that restaurant staff have to be friendly or put up a false front of happiness, of which neither could be found in the numerous staff who served us. The problem however is that none of the people serving were good enough at their job to justify the frostiness they projected all night, with mistake after mistake being made with our orders. You can either be rude and abrasive or bad at your job, but you can't be both.This restaurant has so much potential and some of the other dishes are better than the ones I ordered but I would advise going to one of London's many other Korean spots.",

The meat was delicious, my favorite one was definitely the beef bulgogi (good flavored and very fine pieces)The place is a bit expensive, in my opinion but, it seems fair enough for London average prices.I totally recommend it for a dinner with friends, colleagues or family.

We all tried different things from the lunch menu and all of us left stuffed and happy. - I had the yukhoe bibimbab (it had raw beef on top, but this was cooked perfectly by the hot stone bowl.)- I love that it came with soup and three side dishes (namul, kimchi and some spicy tofu.)- My colleagues had japchae and pork and kimchi rice. They both looked happy too.- The staff were sooo friendly! They even persuaded me that I should go snowboarding in Korea with my husband.- We were all really full, but they still brought us fruit at the end of our meal.

I didn't know about this place until I got off the tube at Holborn but I'm glad I found it. I ordered the soondubu chigae and it was pretty good! A great balance of spice and flavor - sometimes things are spicy to mask the lack of flavor. The only option for the soup is seafood but it comes with quite a bit of meat in it. At lunch time the plates come with banchan included. I'm not sure if this is the case at dinner time. Some reviews say they charge for each one. They have a full bar available. They have table top grills and I will be back to try the bbq! The service is honestly a bit better than typical British restaurants but it's more like a typical Asian restaurant. You will have to wave down the servers to order, get refills, or get the check. The staff was really polite and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. Also don't be put off by the yelp price of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. Lunch for one was less than \u00a310.Overall, I am glad I found a decent, affordable Korean place. I'm from Southern California and that's one of the things I miss the most! Highly recommended for those looking for good korean fare",

    "text": "So i've tried quite a few Korean places in London, and I have to say that this is probably the worst out of all of them - even when comparing it to the chain Korean restaurants that have popped up around the city. When you step into the restaurant, it looks pretty authentic and beautiful - so I had high hopes for the place (which obviously were not met). I came here for the lunch special. First of all, it didn't come with Kimchi or any side dishes - which is to be expected in London. I always love Kimchi no matter what so I paid for it - but I really wish I hadn't. The cabbage pieces were HUGE and impossible to eat without awkwardly biting pieces off (which you really don't want to do for a side dish that is to be shared...). It was also bland, and didn't really taste of anything at all.I ordered the bulgogi beef rice, which was 9.5 pounds. The bulgogi was quite abysmal. The beef was dry, not tender at all (I think it must have been either cooked from frozen, or EXTREMELY old), which bulgogi is supposed to be. The marinade was not authentic at all, either. I asked for some gochugang (korean chilli sauce) which never came. I also asked for a glass of water twice, which was never refilled over the course of one hour. I have never seen broccoli with my bulgogi, and there were random vegetables thrown in there (e.g. bell peppers).Overall a pretty horrendous experience. Wouldn't come here again. You'd expect a LOT more from a place that charges this much.",

I live very close to New Malden (Zone 5, about 15 minutes from Waterloo) and for those of you who don't know, this is Korean Town of UK (in fact a little Birdy told me that it houses more Koreans than any other places other than Korea itself) where you'll definitely find the most authentic Korean dishes at amazing prices. That being said, Asadal is definitely the best Korean restaurant for me outside of New Malden and in London itself where the consistency of great food is always on target. Now, onto the food - I highly recommend #77 - I do believe that this is the spicy beef soup, filled with vegetables and rice inside (Yuk Gae Jang). It is always so good for someone who likes tasty and heart broth with spice for warmth. I have a very high tolerance to spicy food and although this wasn't spicy to me, it's comparable to having Extra Hot in Nandos (sorry - can't think of a better example!). So good, in fact, that I still wanted more! The dishes are reasonable and while not being ginormous will fill most people up. The price is a little more expensive than those in New Malden but you'd expect that for being in London. This restaurant is a short walk away from The New London Theatre so highly recommended if you're in the area. I am due another Asadal meal very soon!",

    "text": "I organised a Korean bbq dinner for a bunch of my friends. Overall, food was solid, but I didn't think it was special in any stand out way relative to other bbq restaurants I've been to. Galbi was marinated well, but I felt like the portions were really small. The soups we ordered were all very flavourful and satisfying. Service is a big reason why I'm giving it only three stars. They took a while to get my reservations properly, and I felt like the staff were a bit curt. Having said that, it was still better than an average service you'd get in London in general. Just don't expect the usual super nice Korean customer service. Finally, ambience was good, but I felt like it was a bit dark. Nonetheless, clean and posh enough.",

The thing preventing me from giving five stars is that the service is officially terrible. Been here three times and it was equally terrible all three times, so it's not a fluke in my mind (and if you read the other reviews I'm not alone).If you can stomach a little bit of extra wait time trying to get a waiter's attention, this place does have great Korean food. \u00a0Worth a visit.",

    "text": "The short of it is a place worthy of your visit if you like Korean food. However nothing particularly special if you can't picture what Korean food looks like when you're confronted with the term. If you're looking for the BBQ menu, this is only served during dinner service.Korean food is something of a mixed bag. It's lumped together with Japanese food, likely due to the recognition of most Japanese items. Korean food has some similarities but where it diversifies, it becomes a marmite type moment where you're either on-board or on an express train out of that cuisine, only to sample when no choice is offeredI'd say I'm of the third route. Not quite a fan, but still willing to give it shots every now and again.Upon arrival I know instantly this is a place where service isn't going to be good. Within eyeshot I see about 5 members of staff, but nobody actually tending to anyone waiting at the entrance at the bottom of the stairs and even the bartender trying to avoid eye contact.After spotting my party and sitting myself down, we'd already ordered so I just sat back to munch. Note we were here for lunch and unfortunately they close quite early. At 3pm, so really only time for a single sitting so you'd want to get here by at least 1.30pm or don't bother. As the starters arrived, we tried to order our mains. However unfortunately it's one of those places where the person bringing you the food isn't allowed to take orders. I'm seriously not a fan of places like this. After a little while a gentleman comes by to take our mains orders.The food is perfectly decent and if you are a fan of Korean pancakes, rice bowls and the like, even pretty good. The gyoza which I consider more Chinese was very nice, but the accompanying sauce not great. The raw salmon excellent. The salad, liberally coated in a spicy sauce but I believe this was more to disguise the fact the salad was starting to brown (indicating not the freshest stock)So in all service wasn't stellar, pricing was a little high, but given the portion size of a few of the dishes, still okay value. I'm probably a little bias as I'm not a big fan of Korean so if you are a fan, perhaps add a star.",

A Korean restaurant in London that actually serves side dishes with your meal??That really deserves a star on its own... seriously.Came here during lunch time and ordered one of their bento boxes. Pretty pricey for galbi at about 15 pounds but at least you get some free side dishes (that's right... plural). Pretty good food, and the restaurant looks very traditionally Korean. I have yet to try their KBBQ so I'll have to put that in the books since this restaurant is relatively close to my school adjacent to Holborn Station.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that I grew up in southern California, USA, where (delicious) Korean restaurants abound, so my standards for Korean food are probably higher than the average UK resident/Londoner. It's not bad, and the smells sure are great in here. However, in general, I found the food to be oily and overpriced. The japche was given to me with meat when I asked specifically for a vegetarian version. I don't mind if they tell me they can't do it that way, but they just took my order, my money and left me with a meat filled dish (takeaway, so I couldn't do much about it).I had the bimbimbap, which I love, but found to be average in taste. And you have to pay for every side dish!! I know this is standard in the UK, but it's difficult to justify paying for dishes that I've become used to always having alongside my meals.Then again, it's probably one of the better Korean restaurants here in London, so if you were to try Korean food for the first time, this might be all to try.",

    "text": "Nice food with poor service.I quite liked the food - we ordered Korean BBQ (pork and beef), noodle, etc - every dish was tasty. The service was not really great - it was a bit difficult to get their attention. Staff came to our table and helped us to do BBQ but I felt it is because they wanted us to finish dinner as quietly as possible so that they can accept more customers. There was an error in the bill (It happens quite often here) but they corrected it when asked so it was OK.The thing I feel I need to share with everyone is very unpleasant experience I've had on the following day.I noticed I had left my phone there and I visited the restaurant again to ask if they had found my phone. I told a male staff that I may have left my phone. He told me 'no, no phone'. I asked if I can get his name as I thought it may be useful to have his name when reporting lost property to the police. He refused to tell me his name, so I asked if I can get manager's name - Then the man went to staff room and came back with the manager, and the manager told me he actually had my phone! I do appreciate the fact that my phone has been back, but I was wondering what would happened if I didn't ask their names - Why the male staff said 'no phone' at first (and then he talked to the manager after hearing the word 'police')?I think they could have treated me in a better way - hope they would improve their service. Again the food was very nice, just the service is not really great and I wouldn't be happy to pay 10% service charge.",

    "text": "The 2.5 star rating for this restaurant (at the time of writing) is wholly unfair.I've had dinner here on three occasions, and all three visits were outstanding. The food is delicious, and judged to be totally legit in terms of authenticity by my boyfriend (who lived in Korea for a year). My favourite is the dolsop bibimbap for its hot beefy, ricey, eggy, cabbagey goodness. And the doenjang-jjigae is his - it's apparently a very traditional Korean dish rarely ordered by westerners, but very spicy!I really can't fault the food or the service at Asadal. Both have been very good on all of my visits. Plus, the place is always filled with east Asians, which surely says something. The only reason I can think that its reviews would be so bad is perhaps due to its very convenience. As if it's a requirement to travel outside of central London via National Rail to guarantee authenticity... or to add to the sense of exoticness. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll happily pay a bit more for my meal at Asadal and hop on the central line home, than travel for an hour to New Malden so I can bring my own cheap wine from the off-licence.Extra bonus points: Asadal has a private dining area for six that you can book ahead of time for an extra cost. Or sometimes they give it to you free.",

I ignored the other reviews on Yelp and paid the price. But just to begin, I walked in around 6PM on a Tuesday evening to find that almost the whole restaurant was empty. I asked for a table for four and was promptly asked if I would be leaving by 7PM. Rude. I was only seated after I agreed. Once all my friends arrived, I flagged down FOUR DIFFERENT WAITERS about six times in total and was told each time to \"hold on a second\" as if we were being impatient. There was one couple next to us that ordered and ate their whole meal in the time it took us to finally have our order taken. In the meantime, I watched other servers stand and hang around the open kitchen window when they easily could've just taken our order in 2 minutes even if they weren't firing up our plates. Clearly, this isn't just a general service problem on the part of the staff, but poor management. Look, the restaurant's in a convenient location, but they need to get their shit together and learn to behave like a proper restaurant in which CUSTOMERS CAN ORDER FOOD. DEAR GOD.",
