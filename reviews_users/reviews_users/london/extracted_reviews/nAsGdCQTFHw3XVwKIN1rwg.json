    "text": "Shoryu is probably still in my book as the best place for ramen in London. Although, I do not feel it taste as good as it use to do - when it only had one shop in Regent Street. However, if friends ask me where to have ramen in London then Shoryu will be my recommendation!Carnaby street branch menu was slighly different, as they had the King Tonkotsu (\u00a315). This consisted of extra noodles, char siu and King prawn. This is good for those who are hungry or want some thing a bit more filling than the normal ramen.",

They gave done a great job filling it up with all types of eateries, bringing in a vibrant evening crowd. Shoryu was buzzing when we were there. A short queue unless you sat st the bar. The bar is a bit squashed but just fine if you want a quick bowl of noodles. We had the ramen of course. So wanted to love it. The soup was quite porky, noodles were not quite springy enough but adequate. At close to \u00a310 a bowl, it's pricey. All in all, it's not love, but just a like.",

    "text": "I have no idea when or where Shoryu came from, but when they arrived, they arrived fast, widespread, and with a lot of hype. Some of it is justified, but I'm sure there's better ramen out there if you want to find it - maybe from an independent little Japanese restaurant - or Bone Daddies (even more hype!) but Shoryu is still definitely a good choice. I have counted 6 Shoryu locations in the Soho, Piccadilly, and Leicester Square area - 4 of which, including this one, are within walking distance of one another. The advantage of the Carnaby location is you can enjoy the outdoor seating of Kingly Court if you are so inclined... if the weather isn't perfect, the ramen will soon warm you up! So for something so sudden and widespread in the area, I was expecting mass-produced bowls of \"ok\" ramen - but it was very tasty. The authentic egg-on-top really added richness and was the best part, and the broth at the end was oh-so-good and warming, as ramen should be. The meat... well, I had their \"classic\" pork and whilst it tasted alright, it wasn't amazing, and I felt like I should have had more meat, and/or more noodles, for the \u00a312 price tag my bowl came with. We started with chicken karaage and gyoze, both of which were fantastic and we wish we had ordered more (perhaps one each) than trying to share - but again we were trying to be thrifty.It wasn't unsatisfactory by any means, but I've had better in both quantity and value-for-money. However, I certainly haven't had better in the area, and my colleagues swear by it - it's a great place for our teams to grab a business lunch and have a chat over a hot bowl of soup. It's a good spot for lunch, and indeed if you are in the area, there's almost certainly a Shoryu around the corner!",

Went with the yuzu instead of the takana tonkotsu which grew on me, it's a spicy lemon-peppery chutney paste that gives this one a kick. If you're feeling in the mood for something different, give it a try! A pork hirata bun is always a good choice and we tried a few cocktails (happy hour 5-7 \u00a35 cocktails).. give the umushu royal and gekkaikan smash a try if you're feeling plummy- the umushu royal is a nice citrusy pre-dinner fizz and the smash is great for after. They've also got frozen topped Kirin! Now I just need it to be hot outside!A few quirks for opening night with service but the food was great. I'm happy to see more ramen places taking over London.",

During the day this location normally has a line out the door but my friend and I arrived late on a Sunday evening and were seated right away. We started with the pork belly bao which were phenomenal and both got ramen afterwards. The bao were really hearty portions and I honestly could have been content with one of those and another appetizer. But... since we came for the Ramen it seemed inappropriate to skip out on their specialty. I had the traditional house ramen which was very good. The egg was cooked well and they did not skimp on the other toppings. Next time I would try the thicker noodles and maybe the vegetarian ramen to switch it up.",

The service is fast and friendly. I appreciate the friendly service. I've found that other restaurants in this area are too focused on being \"cool\" and can't back up the food quality.

    "text": "I'm sorry Shoryu, but you and I, we must part our ways. There was a time when I truly loved you and we have had beautiful times together, mostly with your beautiful eggs which are still beautiful but I can't judge on eggs alone anymore.Teresa C and I wanted to try the new Shoryu opening in Carnaby, and to be quite frank, I was super apprehensive because I had such bad service at the Denman branch so this is their chance to redeem themselves really. It didn't. First things first, Taking bookings for the busiest nights in Carnaby where its a shopping event? it's not like they didn't know, they had a 20% off for that event! The queue wasn't handled effectively- empty tables sometimes, and not using their head to seat bigger tables. Here's a tip from a former waitress- you gotta stop thinking in a linear way. Seating people in a restaurants- you gotta think tactically! This was why I gave a crappy rating last time, I never got the attitude that they wanted me there, as a paying customer. Secondly the food, my first experience of Shoryu, I was blown away and I've brought my friends and family back and everything. The ramen wasn't wow like the flagship branch, the soup wasn't wow, there wasn't any depth. Also, we ordered a side dish at the same time as the mains and it hadn't even arrived even after we finished our ramen. We even asked for it a number of times. We were not impressed. When it finally came, what sounded on the menu sounded great, it was chisou tempura chicken with matcha salt. In practice, it's like they did that 80s thing with stuffing a chicken breast which dries it out then deep fried it. Not good. Also, the matcha salt was lost on it. I wanted to give it another star because I'm loyal, but honestly, it only deserves one. I'm really really disappointed that the last two times I went the service was truly truly atrociously bad.",

She politely said \"of course\". We were worried that someone would quickly be allocated to the seats so once they left we moved our plates to the new area. The rude waitress came up to us and made a total scene telling us in her exact words \"Girls this is not how we work, we need to clean up first, you cannot sit here.\" It was in a very condescending manner and was so embarrassing. I appreciate that they have to clear the table but if we had to wait and ask again the table would have been taken as it was a very busy day. All she had to do was clear it up and not make a big deal. For this reason I refused to pay service charge and they knew why.",

There's an Italian girl who I believe to be the team leader and she was really nice and professional. The ramen was pretty bland (we tried two different varieties) and cannot be compared to real ramen. We also ordered a sharing platter which, at \u00a312 I expected to be a bit more satisfying (three pieces of tasteless tempura and fried chicken, with something that looked like seaweed salad but turned out to be spinach).

They have two person tables, so this really would not have been a big stretch. The only options for people who eat alone are the counter facing the hot kitchen. And it's not possible to even look back to see if there is still light out - the staff keeps asking \"if you are done or still want something else\". I spent a total of 35 min there including the wait for the food and eating the food. 2) my soup came with practically no broth and I asked for some more. They told me that would be 5 gbp. The entire soup is 12, and am really not sure this is normal. The entire time spent there I felt pressed even though the place was half-empty.That ramen was not worth it.",

But as soon as I walked in, there was the familiar smell that instantly reminded me of being in Japan.The greeting, being seated and having the menu explained was all a pleasure. The front of house staff were incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable; there were no questions left unanswered.After a short wait, I was presented with their specialty ramen, the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu. The bowl itself was a decent portion for the price and as soon as I tucked into the bowl I was seriously hooked. It wasn't as good as Japan, but to be honest, it's the best tonkotsu I've had outside Japan.The Hakata style tonkotsu is properly seasoned and intense, yet balanced in the sense that you can still taste the other elements of the broth, unlike Bone Daddies, where the pork in the broth was simply overpowering and was not at all silky smooth like you'd expect. Shoryu do a splendid job at presenting this style to Londoners. Every component in the bowl has been handled with a lot of love and care. And It shows as soon as you have a mouthful of the stuff.All in all, the service is fantastic. The food and drinks are definitely worth a visit and you'll be satisfied with the price tag. Very well done, Shoryu. I am excited for my next visit.",

No other Japanese were there including customers except me though.I had a sesami-seasoned spinach(\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u8349\u306e\u80e1\u9ebb\u548c\u3048) for starter and a kimuchi tonkotsu ramen.The spinach one was much closer to authentic Japanese taste than I had expected. It was too sweat for me and lacked soy-sauce taste though.So I added soy source put on a table to eat.(There were chili oil,vinegar and sesami put on a table other than that.)As for the kimchi ramen, the spicy taste overpowered the taste of tonkotsu so I couldn't really enjoy the taste of tonkotsu.I should've ordered the normal one to know this restaurant better.Anyway they offer a good service, a wide range of food menu and sake.It's definitely a nice ramen restaurant unless you expect the authentic Japanese tasty ramen!!There was a small drum put in front of the door.And the stuff beat it once in a while which must be from the intention of creating an Asian atmosphere and catching more attention, but I liked that : )",

    "text": "Good ramen but a little over 'themed' for my liking. But still highly recommended.The gyoza are some of the best I have had in a while, mainly because the wrapper doesn't over power the filling. The buns are also good. They do need a little more sauce or salt but you have chilli sesame oil and reduced salt soy on the table that you can use to season accordingly. There is a tempura prawn, pork belly, fried chicken or halloumi and mushroom. I'm unsure how Japan halloumi is but I recommend the pork or prawn ones (the prawn one is quite deep fried though so great for a hangover).The ramens have everything you want in a ramen. The tonkotsu bases are my picks. The traditional one is hard to go passed, but the seafood (it still has pork in it) is darn good. Their draught beer selection is all Japanese and perfect soup matches. The wine list is ok but I think beer goes better with this type of food. Every time someone walks in they (mainly the kitchen team) greet you and they also farewell you. There is a lot of 'gong-ing' going on which can get a bit much so try to nab a table outside. It's a really great after work, people watching spot! PS small point: if you get a bench seat on the high tables make sure you are tall as the gap between the table and chair is huge.

I was really happy to see that Shoryu has a restaurant in Kingly Court as my office is in that area, so when a friend of mine asked if we could do lunch I was like 'YES YES CAN WE PLEASE GO THERE YES PLEASE AND THANK YOU'. The tonkotsu was delicious, I had the one classed as 'meatier, creamier and richer' in their menu, though I forget the name. It has a 12h broth, 4 slices of pork (on the very fatty side) and double egg. I added to that a splash of soy sauce, and if the pork hadn't been THAT fatty, my experience would have nearly equaled the one I had at Bone Daddies. Nearly. I still preferred Bone Daddie's 20h pork broth tonkotsu, that was just out of this world good. We sat outside, it was the first time I had lunch al fresco in Kingly Court, and I can't wait to do it again. The service was very nice as well, and the food arrived 7 (SEVEN!) minutes after ordering, so I was really happy. And hungry. Again, I forgot to chat whilst I was slurping on that bountiful amount of fatty ramen, so I probably wasn't particularly entertaining to my friend but hey, that's what ramen does to me. OKAY?",

I've had countless Ramen soups but I really take my hat off to Shoryu. It's perfectly creamy and full of fantastic flavour.The guys next to us ordered frozen beers which are not especially cold but just have frozen froth. We stared at them with interest when they tried to sip their beer. They noticed and said they wouldn't recommend them to us because it's just hard to drink!The high tables are not the most comfortable thing in the world but the long table makes it quite sociable. The waiters are friendly and it's rather fun that they greet you and say goodbye with the sound of a gong and some shouting in Japanese.",

    "text": "Shoryu has not disappointed yet. Having been to the Soho branch twice total, Kingly Court is a welcome addition to the chain of high quality ramen restaurants.Consistency is important and this is one thing Shoryu always gets right. Portions are gigantic. I'm not sure exactly what is responsible, but whilst the broth and ingredients don't look much greater in volume than other ramen places, I always leave stuffed. Add some sides into that (their Bao is delicious) and I can hardly walk out the door.Taste wise, it's always a taste explosion in my mouth. I order spicy and get exactly that. There is always the option to add pressed garlic and more chilli on your table. The broth is incredibly flavoursome. Some ramen places, the soup tastes bland and watery. Here it's incredibly rich and you want to finish every drop.Service. This is where Shoryu Soho fell down a bit, being slow to serve, delivering sides after mains etc.. However Shoryu corrected most of that. The only small annoyance on the opening week were multiple staff trying to take your order when it had already been taken. But it's a lot better than previous experience.The Kingly Court branch has a more casual feel due to the small layout and high shared tables. That said, a lot more places are utilising space in this way, and it's not always a bad thing as you can sometimes engage other groups in a friendly chat.Anyway, if you haven't been to Shoryu, what are you waiting for!",

    "text": "After my previous disappointing experience at Shoryu I was invited for a complimentary meal to show what improvements have been made since their soft opening. Although this meal was paid for I can honestly say it was there were drastic improvements across all factors that night. And before I start I do want to praise Shoryu for listening to their customers and since I've known them that is all they have been doing. They have at least changed their noodles four times since they first opened, from using the Chinese noodle to the Japanese variety to making their own. Major improvements have been made to their Tonkotsu's broth which I remember started off very salty and now it is one of the richest and fragrant ones I know of in London and perfectly seasoned to my taste all because they are listening.As you can see on my first visit I raised up many concerns and complaints about their meat quality, service and other food quality during their soft opening. But to my surprise they took it all on board professionally and to their advantage to make things better. I was harsh and delivered my disappointment aggressively but received only patience and understanding. Since then they have changed their meat supplier although we were clearly demonstrated that the meat was not raw but because they changed meat supplier which had meat that remained pink even when cooked. But as they could not risk for customers to experience the same shock and to be mistaken they have changed back to their old supplier. To not make this experienced too 'fixed' or prepared we turned up unexpectedly and already the place felt a lot calmer and organised. It would be bias to comment on the service as we did receive extra attention and service but trying to judge upon looking around, everyone seem content. But not once was I made to feel uncomfortable for complaining and was looked after very well.Food was my greatest concern anyway. We asked for a repeat of last visit's order to see if improvements have been made and so we started of with the pork belly hirata buns again. From my photos you can see that the pork is actually visible this time covering a good percentage of the bun. It was a lot more succulent and juicy, just like how I have had it at their other branches. Together with their fluffy airy light buns we very much enjoyed this. With 2-for-1 on hirata buns on Mondays I will be back for this.Our anticipation was finally over when the Tonkotsu arrived. Although there was nothing to fault with my King Tonkotsu on my last order I kept it the same to check on its consistency. And I was glad to have it not disappoint me as the broth was just as rich with depth like how I had it last time. I do enjoy having the free sesame and fresh cloves of garlic available on each seating for self service as I do love my garlic even if it means having garlic breathe after. Luckily for me my boyfriend loves garlic. I also love my sesame. The only slight change were the prawns as they were slightly overcooked compared to last time so lost it's bouncy texture but still it tasted fresh and just a preference of how I like my prawns cooked. Pork was as tender and generous and egg nice and yokey. It was delicious, so much I didn't want it to end.It was such a relieved to see the pork browned as the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu arrived. And when they get this dish right they really do get it right as it was delicious, rich with a good spicy depth to it. The mince pork creates a really nice texture against the noodles because it clings to the noodles so you can the meat taste in every bite. With the crunchy kikurage mushrooms and spring onions which comes in every tonkotsu the dish was a pleasure to devour with a really good bite. We finished on cocktails which were great with more preference towards my Yuzu Mojito which was made unique with the additional umeshu which sweetened it. I found the negroni a bit too bitter compared to others I've had but I'm not an expert to judge further. We were happy to know they have taken aboard the chef at their original branch in Regent's Street which could explain the improvements made. Staff seems to have settled down and I can see it becoming a very successful place in the heart of Carnaby Street as they are the only Japanese restaurant around since Ramen Seto closed down. Great deals are also coming along for more budget diners e.g. their Sunday ramen for \u00a38.95.After this visit and my contentment with their high level of customer service I have given my first poor experience a pass. I will definitely be returning back to try their Kingly specials and can only hope for consistency which I have faith they will be able to deliver.",

We shared a signature hakata tonkotsu, highly recommended by our waitress. It was awesome, soup was thick and flavorful. We concluded with green tea ice cream float and a green tea roll cake.

    "text": "This was probably my favorite meal we had in London. I am a big fan of ramen and this place peaked my interest. We got here around 7pm at night. This place was nicely placed in a pretty popular shopping/food center. We walked into this place with no reservation and they asked if we would be okay sitting at the bar, otherwise we would've have to wait . We didn't mind being seated at the bar as this meant we could eat sooner. They rang their gong when we came in. The waitress came over to us and was explaining the ramen and the different menu they had put out for summer. This place also had an option for noodle firmness, to me this is almost unheard of! I ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu which was recommended by our waitress, and I stuck with the regular futsuu standard of noodle. I also ordered some salmon nigiri. Our food looked delicious when it arrived. I really enjoyed to flavor of the soup and the noodles were cooked just the way I like them. I probably could've gone up a level on noodle firmness, but I enjoyed how they absorbed some of the broth. The salmon nigiri was 8 thick pieces that were pretty good. I would absolutely be back here again if given the opportunity. Though the restaurant was busy we didn't have a lack of water, but the waitress did end up forgetting to come back to us for our order because they ran out of something specific. This didn't really matter to us because we were full by the end anyways.",

    "text": "Amazing ramen. If you need a reasonably priced, healthy meal this place will not disappoint. All of the dishes are beautifully plated in typical Japanese style. We tried the chicken, and pork buns. Both good, but a little heavy on the mayo (I recommend you ask for lite mayo). The enochi butter mushroom appetizer is very good and has a delicious sauce. The ginger salmon is tempura fried and the dipping sauce is unfortunately mayonnaise. We loved all 3 ramens we ordered, the shoryu ganso tonkotsu, miso wafu chicken, and the white natural. Be warned that the wafu chicken is fried. The broth on all the soups is rich and nourishing. Your body will thank you.My only gripe is cleanliness of tables (sticky) and floors in the courtyard (lots of spilled ramen).",

There was a short wait when we went there and you can put your phone number down so that it will update you on your current queue in line. I didnt mind the wait since the area has so much to see and explore. I tried the pork belly bun, takoyakis and the black garlic oil ramen. Pork belly bun was great better than the deep fried chicken bun my friend had and the black garlic oil ramen was alright. I liked how they provide fresh garlic on the table and you can use a garlic crusher to add it into your bowl of ramen. The star of the night was definitely the takoyakis, it was way better than some of the places i tried in Norcal and Socal. My friend said it is comparable to the takoyakis in Japan.We went there around 6 something PM but when we were leaving there is a line of people waiting to be seated.",

Cooked perfectly but had no seasoning.+ Ramen itself is chewy and cooked correctly.Check please -'s:- Took one slurp of the broth and was horrified. I have had my share of excellent ramen from Tokyo to New York to San Francisco. F!! The broth at Shoryu was poor. I could not taste anything in it. It was so watered down I dumped soy sauce into my bowl. It was a dump--not a douse--to get some flavor.- Nothing else was in this bowl. Yes I saw the strips of dried seaweed and the fatty pork was fine but nothing else really filled the bowl.- Price. I hate paying for a bowl that I have to fix.Overall we came here because we had no reservations in London on a Saturday night. We grabbed this seating because it was the only place that would take us without reservations. If you are starving and have nowhere else to go, then this place will work.",

Regarding the quality of the food, it was fantastic. Every component within the Ramen bowl was done very well. I also liked how you can choose the texture of your noodles (soft, medium, hard). Additionally, I ordered a prawn bun and bbq chicken bun, both were pretty good. But the ramen stole the show. The part that was most impressive to me was that our food literally came out in 4 minutes after ordering. The combination of quality of food, service, and atmosphere made my Shoryu experience awesome. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that I went to another Shoryu location a week later and it wasn't nearly as good there, which was disappointing.",

I was the first one to finish. My only complaint was that the shape of my spoon didn't allow me to scoop all the broth out of the bowl.

In those cases I either try them again (not likely) or I just don't write a review about them, because you never know- maybe they were having a rough day... ammiright? Just being fair. In this case, I've only been to Shoryu Ramen in Carnaby once and it blew my freaking mind. Like, mouth orgasms multiple times, lots of noises, probably some of the best ramen I've ever had. Maybe it had something to do with the time of day and how the moon was lined up with the sun. I don't know. Anyway, in the case of fairness, this place gets 4 stars, because I think I need to go back and try it again before giving 5. Just being fair. So, my husband and I got the Curry Ramen and The Original (minus the meat, but with pork broth), and the shrimp tempura bun and haloumi cheese and mushroom bun. Those buns were so good. Seriously, the bread was just perfect and the insides were so flavorful and the right amount of crunchy and soft. Holy momma mia I loved those buns. They had just a small amount of sauce that added the perfect amount of flavor. And then the ramen. So flavorful and amazing. Both broths were completely different and unique. Very very good. I'm gonna come back to try their veggie ramen.",

If you like the bouncy , chewy texture for your noodles, you want to look for a ramen that serves \"egg noodles\" for their ramen.

This one packed quite a bit of heat compared to other tan tan ramens I've had, but it still hit the spot. Extra items come out separately vs. in your ramen. There's a whole garlic bulb with a garlic press on the table if you want to add any- it would be nice if it was already pre-pressed for convenience.Happy hour drink specials Monday-Thursday from 5-7pm.

Speedy service, and seating even though they were busy - it only took 5minutes before they found us a comfortable window seat (perfect for people watching and girlie catching up). The menu leaves nothing to be desired, with an excellent range of ramen, sides and contemporary/traditional dishes.Naturally it being the weekend, we decided to accompany our meal with one of their Tokyo Autumn inspired cocktails. Spice lovers I would definitely recommend the 'Wake Me Up in Tokyo' a delicious fresh cocktail with added chilli to give it a little kick - Seriously tasty! Wanting to try something different I opted for the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu - tonkotsu with a twist - rich & spicy minced pork marinated in white miso, garlic and chiu chow chilli oil (no char siu barbecue pork belly, no sesame). Amazing! Just the right level of spicy to give it a kick but not too subtle on the flavour. Served in authentic deep dish bowls, I struggled to finish all of this - seriously felt like it was a bottomless bowl!It would have been rude for us to leave without sampling at least one other of the Autumn signature cocktails (it's was Saturday, don't judge ;) ). We left our meal feeling extremely satisfied and suitably stuffed!Five stars happily awarded for this Ramen joint, thanks for reminding me what a great dish ramen is - can't wait to return!",

    "text": "I actually enjoyed my wafu chicken ramen but the service was dismal.The idiot at the front whose sole job was to seat people tried unsuccessfully twice to seat us at shared tables in seats already allocated to other diners. \u00a0The one empty table, with a bowl of ramen sitting empty, was apparently on hold while the diner went to the loo, which wasn't the case at all. \u00a0I can't go into more detail as it would surely bore you to read as much as it would me to type, but take my word this boob was a massive pain.Other service was bad - obviously not well run and our server seemed very unhappy working. Also, food took forever - like 35 minutes for a bowl of soup. Wafu chicken ramen was tasty, tho the chicken a bit dry and needed salt badly.A bit expensive for poor service and ok noodle soup. \u00a0Oh well, at least the company was spot on.",
