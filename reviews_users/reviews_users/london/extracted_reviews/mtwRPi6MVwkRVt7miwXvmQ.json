That said, I wasn't too disappointed with the quality here and theres one big reason why I've kept coming back.I got the 'cheese\" which is just a cheeseburger. They have many more interesting options including the \"Babaganoush\"-Peter's secret recipe with mashed aubergines blended with tahini & spices and the \"Kiwiburger\"-beetroot, egg, pineapple, cheese, salad, mayonnaise & relish among others.The meat was nice, thick and of high quality. They cooked it just as I ordered it at medium.However there were two things that turned me off. The cheese was just not that flavorful, and what flavor it did had was quite peculiar. It was \"aged cheddar\" instead of american or sharp cheddar most american burgers come with. Secondly, the bun had all sorts of seeds and flavors on it that made it more like an \"everything\" bagel than a normal burger bun.The real reason why I really like this place is not that they have awesome burgers, but that they have a card for 40%(!) off all food for students. A great deal and a great reason why I will be heading here even though I miss the quality of In N' Out, The Apple Pan, Father's Office, The Library, Umami, the Habbit and others back in LA.",

My husband had the classic cheeseburger and loved it, but I had the Californian veggie burger and it was OUTSTANDING. I do eat meat, but I love a good veggie burger now and then and this one is the best I've ever had. Such care and attention to detail with a perfect combination of flavors!

It was probably one of the best veggie burgers I've had due to the the tasty fried black bean patty. It didn't taste too greasy and felt unexpectedly light. Along with that we shared a GBK salad and chunky fries. Both nice. The workers do well clearing out tables in a timely fashion for the next party and orders brought out promptly. We arrived right at dinner time and all tables were occupied so it did feel a bit tight. If I turned around I was uncomfortably close to our neighbors plate so when we left and I turned around to grab my purse hanging off my chair, I felt intrusively close. This is my second visit to this chain and we left with our bellies full and very satisfied.",

Carlos took great care of us and explained our different options to us.",

    "text": "My god how much I liked this place. The burgers were just outstanding! So good. I also tried the veggie burgers and they were amazing as well. The one I tried was the California, and it didn't disappoint. It's was good, tasty and light at the same time. Loved it. They also serve really good onion rings, crispy and sweet. So so tasty. The place is kind of small and so are the tables, which makes me think that this place could use some restructuring to renovate the interiors. Once you are handed the menus you have to go at the counter and tell the waiter what you would like to order. I guess this could be kind of a bummers since you have to stand up and go to the counter every time you want to order something. Also everything must be paid in advance. I don't really like it when it's like that. But besides these last things: my god this is a place to try out. Can't wait to go back.",

After looking at the menu I opted for a cheeseburger(got to choose between 3 types of cheese&got to shoose how I wanted my burger(well done), chips with garlicky mayo, onion-rings and a banana milkshake.I was free to then take some water and nuts whilst waiting for the food to arrive. The milkshake came pretty quick and it was delicious. But rather huge, whilst I was able to finish the lovely burger once it had arrived I left about half of the chips&onion rings. Was tempted to ask for a doggy bag but felt too embarrassed to do so. Still lovely food and would happily go back, but next time I'll probably just have a burger&a milkshakeOh whilst you had to pay for the garlicky mayo(and other sauces) the ketchup was free",
