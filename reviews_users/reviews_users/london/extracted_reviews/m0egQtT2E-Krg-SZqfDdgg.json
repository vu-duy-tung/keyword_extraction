The annoying thing is, it's hard to moan baout becuase they don't do anything wrong. Well, they did serve me a glass of shit wine once, but I was hungover and i imagine my taste was somewhat impaired. It's not their fault that I don't like brown rice, but it did ruin my stir fry. To be honest, once we got here, i wanted to leave. i realised that while it may be a fun homely place during the day, full of a buzz and fun with the market on it doorstep, that all changes in the veening and it's a bit dull. I wish i'd had the balls to say let's go somewhere else or at least make a fake phone call. So we sat on uncomfy chairs, had an uncomfy meal and then left. Giraffe: not very comfy.",

The service is always top notch, and they are happy to discuss with you various dishes on the menu to help make your selection. Being just that bit away from the city, and on the fringes, make this not full of city workers, but full of the sort of mix of people who would visit the market, so it is an interesting place to be - especially the people watching! The menu is extensive, and much of it healthy, although their world famous burgers are amazing too! Definately give it is try if you are in the area.",

And at \u00a36.95 I was tempted to take it back. \u00a0Washed down with my blueberry bliss smoothie, it almost filled a hole & I didn't complain, but once again promised myself that this was the final time I graced Giraffe with my presence.",

It's a decent size and the windows on two sides of the restaurant means that you can watch the hustle and bustle of the area whilst you enjoy your nosh. And what nosh it is! The portions are huge - especialy the burgers, and even if you have a large appetite I recommend leaving some space for the divine desserts - sometimes I only come here for pudding! The staff are friendly, the service is quick and if you are bringing children this place is perfect. They offer a very good children's menu as well are colouring-in mats and crayons to keep the little one's entertained (sometimes baloons are also given at the end of the meal). One of my favourite restaurants for a relaxed meal with friends.",

I enjoy their hummus and flatbread along with the chicken and couscous. Their meal deal offers several options, so I went with Mediterranean stylings. You don't have to pick a region, but I've been enjoying kebabs all weekend, so it seemed fitting. The flatbread was great, the perfect scooping device for the tasty green hummus. I enjoyed the pickled items that with this dish also. The slightly spicy chicken's flavor was nicely offset with the couscous's slight sweetness. Great place for evening dining needs or carry out orders.",

    "text": "Went to Giraffe for dinner in the week, ealry-ish, a couple of weeks ago. Had the set menu which was pretty cheap - something like a tenner for 2 decent courses and a glass of wine. Good points - the service was good - My curry was too spicy to eat so they replaced it with an alternative dish quite quickly and free of charge with no fuss. The price was good, and the noise, and music was just right. Bad points - the wine was a small glass which wasn't specified on the menu (I wans't in a drinking mood anyway though to be fair), and the chargrilled chicken we has was pretty dry and chewy but passable. It has a very kind of'clean, family, fun' atmosphere which isn't really my cup of tea but they seem to do what they do, well. Went again today for a lunch with colleagues. Again the set menu was reasonable and the food was hot and delicious. They seated us straight away even though it was busy and the service was good. I was going to go for the 'A-ok' 3 stars but the good service pushes it up to 4 for me. To keep it a good 4 or 5 stars they should push the cocktails and wine more in the evening, and the music could be better, it needs more of an edge, especially in Spitalfields, but I think thats just the brand. Wouldn't specifically go there again but if I ended up there I know I'd get good service.",

The happy hour is pretty decent and Sunday night, a bottle of the house is always welcomed. This Giraffe closes at 23:00. So when I arrived at 22:10 and was seated I didn't expect to be so rushed. They said we had to order upon being seated because the kitchen wanted to close early. So luckily we knew what we wanted, but the cheesy bread that came out was burned, guess the kitchen was in a super rush. The rest of the food was as mediocre as possible. My friend's pasta which was supposed to have marscapone cheese, looked like sour cream was placed on instead and tasted like it. I will not be coming back.p.s. Lamb burger is usually a safe bet. Too much bun though at times.",

    "text": "My mother and I stopped here for lunch on one of my rare trips to London to visit family, hoping for a tasty meal in a pleasant environment.The staff was very friendly, attentive and prompt. We were originally seated at a four seater table but were moved to a two seater table as we were looking at the menus - they weren't rude about it and they were very busy so no complaints! We also ended up with a table next to the window which was a bit quieter and altogether more agreeable! The whole place is reasonably attractive (and clean), and the bright decor and style reflects its \"global\" fusion food style.For drinks my mother ordered cranberry juice and I sparkling water. Both were very nice but a bit mean on the portion size - very small glasses!We had a sharing platter as a starter, with mixed olives, naan and focaccia bread, and hummus and baba ganoush to dip them in. The breads were nice though the focaccia was slightly burnt, the dips were so-so, but the mixed olives were lovely - and they had these delicious tiny onions in the mix with a depth of crunch and flavour that was delightful! If I visit again I'll stick with the olives instead.My mother had the Zuma Beach Salad for a main - I must confess I didn't try it but she reported that the dressing was not especially tasty (possibly a matter of taste) and that the salad over all was \"all right\" but she was most pleased that it had proper beetroot instead of the pickled stuff.I had the vegetable burrito and I was disappointed. The vegetables had been so thoroughly smothered in the sauce that you couldn't taste them, and the feta was inexplicably all in a stripe across the middle instead of scattered throughout. The best bit was the topping which had been saved from the dreaded sauce and was a combination of seeds and tomato chunks and was rather delicious. Overall it was a good dish made with (as far as I could tell) good ingredients spoiled by a heavy sauce that rendered it a bit tasteless. The side-salad it came with was tasty - good quality ingredients - but I couldn't have told you that the dressing was tequila and lime. It just tasted like a plain old caesar salad dressing, and a mild one at that.All in all, I'm not sure if I or my mother would want to return. Good idea, well-trained staff, whoever sauces the ingredients is excellent, but the recipes or the execution of them is flawed.",

I have to confess I dislike noodles since one day that I fell sick after tucking away at the noodles king, but these were significantly nicer. We also order the Greek burger, on a somewhat stale focaccia. Yet the thought of using focaccia for a burger is so awesome that it can be forgiven. In short, good food.

The service wasn't as bad as everyone says it was, though we did have to wait a really long time before our waitress came over to take our orders. I ordered the \u00a37.50 dinner special and got the garlic bread to start and the half Portugese chicken with mash as an entree. It seemed as though everything had been put together sloppily. The garlic bread was really good, but the cheese in the middle of three of the four pieces of bread was still solid, and the fourth piece was burnt. The chicken was mediocre. I got a fair amount of chicken, but the mashed potatoes were hard and dry with limp bits of cilantro mixed in, and the coleslaw (which was essentially mayo-covered onions) had been haphazardly dumped on top of my chicken. Coming from Los Angeles, where presentation is everything, this was kind of a turn off.It was a fairly pricey meal, and for what you get, I'd say it's not really worth it. I'd rather save the money for Nandos.",

As I looked around I came across this unique spot. I went over the menu and there was such a huge variety of delicious sounding dishes I had a hard time deciding.I started with the Smokey Chorizo. Spanish style Chorizo cooked in a honey / sherry vinegar glaze. It was so tasty I could have eaten 3 more orders before my main course came out.Then I enjoyed the Thai Duck Stir-Fry. It was very delightful also. The duck was very tender.Add two hot coco's to warm me up and the Banana Waffle Split for dessert and I went back to my room far more content than I should have been.This is a great choice for 1 to 10 people. So many items and taste to choose from. You and everyone else will leave happy.",

They mixed up our order at first so it took a while for them to both come out but once they did the food was actually very nice. The Asian slaw that came with the Chicken Tenders wasn't very nice but the rest was delicious. \u00a0We then decided to order dessert. I got the Rocky Road Sundae which was decent and my friend got the apple and passion fruit crumble which was disappointing as the only passion-fruit involved was a little drizzle of passion-fruit syrup on top of the crumble. Service: They were a little bit too overzealous with asking if everything was okay more times than was necessary but when we actually wanted their attention they seemed to have blinders on. \u00a0Also three out of four of the female toilets were blocked and no one seemed to care. I spoke to a person at the beginning on the meal about it and I overheard someone else mention it at the end of the meal over an hour later!",

They were awfully slow considering they must get other customers like this - I'm glad I didn't have any pressing meetings to get to.I got a veggie version of an English Breakfast, which I've always kind of wanted to try. It was okay, but I wasn't too excited about it - it was lukewarm when I got it, not much flavor, except for the veggie sausages, which I'm pretty sure are the same pre-packaged brand I sometimes get from the grocery.The atmosphere was pretty nice though. Fun, optimistic, light-hearted. I'm glad I tried it, anyway.",

I took the huevos rancheros. It's not the most excited think to eat but for the price and the area it's not bad at all. One of my friends had the veggie version of the brunch and the other one had the full English breakfast. No one complain about their food so that's a good sign. In term of dessert I had the banana split waffle. Nothing exciting but nice dessert I can say. My friends haLooking for a nice place to have a drink on Saturday night and we end up in Adventure Bar. That was a good spot! Even if the bat is busy they take the time to do some pretty nice cocktails! And if you decide not to drink the cocktail without alcohol are really cheap! (\u00a33 my friend paid for a long and juicy cocktail fruit) the place is big and you can even book a table if you are a big group. The decoration is ok and what I like is that it did not smell like all these busy bars where you think you won't be able to stand there more than an hour! The music was not too bad and the bar women took every opportunity to dance with the crowd as soon as they could. Anyway nice place for a drink on a Saturday night! d the brownie, the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake. All were ok. Also this place is huge, so no need to queue and baby friendly so easy to come with a pram (which was the main reason why I end up there) So in conclusion if you don't know what to eat and in the same time you want a reasonable price and are not too difficult this place will easily do the job!",
