    "text": "Tapas is always a good idea in my estimation. \u00a0What's not to like about lots of small plates filled with tasty goodness? \u00a0London has no shortage of Tapas restaurants - Iberica, Brandisa, Barrafina to name a few. So why go to Dehesa? \u00a0Well for starters you can make a reservation which you can't do for the last two on that list. \u00a0The atmosphere is also great - dark and intimate but loud and alive. \u00a0And last but not least, the food is consistently amazing. \u00a0This week we had the goat cheese special (a trio of goat cheese with rosemary honey), the Spanish chacuterie plate (there are Spanish and Italian options), squid with mint and chickpeas, and minature peppers stuffed with pine nuts and spinach, among other things. \u00a0The fact that I can remember the meal in such detail several days later sort of says it all.A warning: I put Dehesa in the Special Occasion category because it is not the cheapest tapas place in town. \u00a0Quite the opposite, and that extends to its wine list - which is not that extensive but ridiculously priced.",

The reason I absolutely love this place is the customer service / management. \u00a0My friends and I tried to reserve space a few days ahead of time and the place was booked. \u00a0We decided to show up on the night and try our luck. \u00a0The manager told us it would be very hard to fit us in; he suggested that we sit at the bar across the way and wait. \u00a0Within 30 minutes, he walked over to the bar and said that they had a cancellation and he would fit us in. \u00a0I was shocked. It's pretty rare to have any restaurant seek you out in this city. \u00a0I'm now a fan and even enjoy their Salt Yard location. \u00a0In fact, I ran into the same manager at Salt Yard and let him know how wonderful he was.",

It is an award-winning bar and restaurant serving modern tapas inspired by the flavours and produce of Spain and Italy. The tapas are complemented by charcuterie and cheese boards.

Dehesa is the unique woodland area in Spain which is home to the black-footed Iberico pigs- said to produce the best ham in the world.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of Spanish food, but this is one of my favourite restaurants in London. \u00a0I'm guessing I love the food so much because it has a heavy Italian influence (while still maintaining a few classic Spanish staples that I do really enjoy - i.e. jam\u00f3n iberico, croquetas (their salt cod ones are incredible) and manchego cheese).. Be sure to order the grilled sourdough bread with aioli as an accompaniment to anything. \u00a0Or, for the perfect snack to begin your feast - have the bread along with the jamon iberico, a bit of cheese and quails eggs.For the tapas, you really can't go wrong. \u00a0The combination of flavours in each small dish is perfectly inspired. \u00a0They periodically change up the dishes (usually just by altering the accompanying sauce/veg/herb etc) but a very recent visit there yielded 2 new favourites: \u00a0sliced guinea fowl with spinach gnocchi and truffle vinaigrette and a butternut squash with chanterelle mushrooms and rocket. \u00a0They always seem to have the pork belly on the menu as well which is the best I've had anywhere.The dining area is quite cramped but the atmosphere is lively - it's a great spot to meet up with a friend (or three, but no more) for a fun and stomach-pleasing dinner.",

Took the last 2 seats (at the bar) and settled into a delicious meal. Ok, this isn't the tapas of some grungy-but-authentic-little-place in the backstreets of Madrid. It's very much London tapas. But it's great. A note on the service. In theory good service is about flawlessness. In practice I find good service is actually about how you recover from the mistakes that will inevitably be made. And there were a few. A dish that was delivered but not ordered. Another dish that was ordered but not delivered. But the recovery was great - the unordered dish stayed, free. The late dish was rustled up, free. A 20% discount was applied to the lot, and some sherry appeared from nowhere just before coffee. I'm sure the business manager of this place might have winced at all this, but it sure made a good impression on us. We'll be back.",

This Spanish style restaurant is a more up market version of the Salt Yard in Goodge street and offers an excellent combination Spanish- Italian wines, cured meats, cheeses and small dishes which are more elaborate than the conventional tapas in some Spanish restaurants. I was dining there with a few friends a few weeks ago and it was quite busy. Although they don't take bookings we managed to find ourselves a nice out of the way table near a bay window. The seating in the main restaurant consists of rows of high bar stools, but if you get in early then a some proper tables are available. The menu is quite extensive with a huge choice from the meat, fish and vegetable tapas. I have eaten here a few times and on this occasion I decided to start with salt cod croquette accompanied with deep fried courgette flowers stuffed with Monte Enebro cheese with a drizzle of honey. For the main course I went for the lamb chops served with a pleasing hot mint sauce and the meat was I admit served at just the right temperature. The main dish was accompanied with polenta cakes with gorgonzola,braised Swiss Chard done in a tomato sauce garnished with a perfect poached egg. I finished off with an unusual dessert consisting of fresh figs roasted in sherry served with wafer thin biscuits and burnt lemon ice cream which had a pleasing texture brought out by the tangy citrus juices which had been caramelized in a subtle fashion without showing any traces of being burnt. All the sherries,wines ports were chosen well to accompany the main meal. A meal for two with wine would be around 75 pounds and well worth for a special occasion.",

Executed to a high and consistent standard.The menu looks like it changes with the season and has a selection of vegetable, fish and meat dishes. You need about 3 dishes per person so it's a good way to try out different items. Personal favourites include the pork belly with canellini beans (really tender and really crispy skin) with just the right level of rosemary coming through. Other reviewers also mention this one! \u00a0The mackerel with bean and pepper salad was great as well as the stuffed courgette flowers.On a previous visit they had the most wonderful variation on bread pudding which was simultaneously soft, light and crispy but doesn't seem to be on the menu any more. Deserts on my most recent visit weren't quite as good as last time.It's a small den of a place with a cosy feel on the corner of Kingly St and Ganton St. so a good place to stop by in the centre of town. Perfect for two, you can sit at the bar or for 3 people they have a few tiny booth tables that are just big enough. Not good for a crowd.

I have been here several times and I recommend booking a table, or putting your name down before you go grab a few drinks elsewhere. Dehesa is cozy and intimate, a perfect place for a date or catch up with friends. I have been there 3 times and this last time was my favorite yet, my mom and I had the following:Fish Tapas:stone bass carpaccio, it was fresh and reminded me of Peruvian ceviche I have had. The smoked mackerel was particularly good as well. Meat:Their Iberico ham is excellent, you cannot go wrong with this choice, along with some bread, it is a great way to start or end the meal.The pork belly was cooked to perfection, crunchy on the outside and extremely flavorful, accompanied with cannellini beans, it was a perfect combination and very filling. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the Padron Peppers. They seemed to be slightly grilled and sprinkled with sea salt. We got two servings of them because they were just that good, I could have eaten a hundred of them. We washed all of this down with one of the three beers they serve (we weren't in the mood for wine, but they have a good selection) The beer was called Alhambra Reserva, It was recommended by the bar tender, and it was particularly good, i was expecting your run of the mill lager, but it had a golden color, with a aromatic hopyness to it and a malty finish. For \"dessert\" we had the courgette flowers which were filled with goats' milk cheese with honey drizzled over. I say dessert because it's actually a vegetable tapas dish, but cheese and honey says dessert to me. I didn't try their actual desserts, but maybe next time I'll save some room.",

    "text": "I came here on a stag do and was not disappointed! Every course was heavenly, the wine surprisingly good and the private room we had very classy. Service was attentive and the dimly lit rooms gave the restaurant a very cosy atmosphere. Particularly noteworthy was the option we had to provide our own soundtrack, allowing us to chow down on fine tapas to the music of Queen, Delphic and Basement Jaxx, just as the Spanish do on a daily basis I'm sure! The only negative was that it was fairly pricey. Not offensively so, or sufficient in any way to stop me from coming back, more something to be aware of. I haven't been to Barrafina so can't comment on how the two compare. Indeed, as Barrafina doesn't take bookings, it wasn't an option on this occasion.In all, Dehesa is definitely worth a try.",

As a London who lived for 4 years in in Madrid, and now reside in LA, whenever I'm back here I seek out the best Spanish restos, since they're non-existent in Los Angeles (every supposed tapas place there is staffed by Mexicans, just like every supposed Mexican restaurant in London is staffed by Spaniards).The highlights of our meal were the pork belly on creamy mashed potato (the pork skin crispy to perfection), the braised oxtail on polenta, and hake with a chorizo paste that was out of this world (is there a more common food cliche? Sorry).The tortilla was outstanding too with an unexpected creamy delicious center.The prawns were just good, not worth mentioning (unlike the perfect ones at Barrafina on Firth).The macchiatto was perfectly brewed; a lovely way to cap the eve.",

    "text": "There I said it: I just came home from Europe, and my decadent, food-loving soul barely emerged while on foreign soil. Why? Because I visited England and France, not Spain and Italy. Don't get me wrong: I weep at the prevalence of chorizo and charcuterie plates in every butcher shop, excellently simple chevre and lardon baguettes, and chocolate macarons. Not to mention five-course dinners at French weddings, or the peasant appeal of an English breakfast, with just-charred tomatoes, thick rashers of bacon, and a puddle of beans and egg yolk all sopped up with toast.Even so, my culinary heart has always been torn between, and so found a double home in, Spain and Italy. The simplicity of fresh and bold ingredients, the reverence for and tradition of elemental cooking, the spice and depth of the wine....So it comes as no surprise that my one meal to plan and anticipate, salivating, would be at Dehesa.And so my heart was satiated over and over, and the evening became one of such loveliness, such delight over the wine and the new little plate on the bar, such smiles of pure delight....Grilled squid and chorizo salad, just vinegary with pickled onions and spicy with pimenton. Asparagus spears topped with shavings of black truffles. Crispy-seared pork belly nested on a simple layer of cannellini beans, dotted and flavored with bits of pungent rosemary. Three kinds of ivory and golden manchego cheese, surrounding a tiny block of membrillo. Sea bream, grilled with tender mushrooms. Three shot glasses of red, green, and orange gazpachos, accompanied by slivery-thin shavings of salty ham.And...two wands of courgette flowers. Bathed and crisped in honey. And stuffed with creamy, delicate goat cheese. Sweet, and lovely, and those few slow and savoring bites will stay in my mind as one of my vivid food memories, so perfectly contrasted and united in both theory and execution.Without a reservation, you can eat at the bar or the communal table, and bask in the warmth and energy, and look with pleasure at the hocks of Iberico ham resting on the counter behind you, and swirl your glass of wine, and simply delight. So in my little way, I happily come home from Spain and Italy too, by way of Soho (and also of France, through the bartender Pepe). Wildly smiling still, of course....",

Perhaps it was all the legs of pork in the window (see photos) that drew us in. A tapas joint - perfect! More food to share. Everything we ordered is exceptional:Pan fried duck breast with truffle!Grilled squid and chorizo saladprosciutto di Parma (OMG this stuff MELTS in your mouth!)Spanish collection of cheese...all this and then some along with a \u00a0bottle of Chardonnay. Bill came out to 150...why do tapas have to be so expensive? They are just small plates!

Probably won't come here again as Barrafina is much much much much much much much better.I like Dehasa's ambiance and decor, but that's about it. \u00a0The food tries very hard to be a \"different\" style of tapas (and it certainly isn't your normal spanish tapas) but none of the dishes made me want to have more. \u00a0Nothing stood out as inventive (although they sound like they might be on the menu), or very tasty (again, tastes good, but nothing special). \u00a0The portions are excruciatingly small for the amount you pay.We had (between 2):1. peach and tomato salad -interesting, but not that interesting2. rabbit wrapped in parma ham and paella -sounds interesting, tasted very ordinary. \u00a0the paella was actually very good, but too bad they only heaped two small spoonfuls of it on the plate. \u00a03. grilled bream -again, sounded very tasty on the menu, but tasted like a normal grilled fish with some lemon and herbs4. prawns and saffron potato -extremely ordinary tasting5. patatas fritas -actually, the only thing that was very good (and that is sad)Service was not wonderful either. \u00a0We had to flag our waitress down every time (took ages...and the restaurant wasn't that full or busy either). \u00a0She never smiled at us ONCE until of course, at the end when we were paying our bill and giving tips. \u00a0While I was paying, I didn't tell her to put in a tip on my debit card, but she took the liberty of putting the \"optional\" tip in anyways. \u00a0I didn't want to deal with having to tell her that I actually wanted to pay less, so I just paid the god damn bill and left. \u00a0Again, I'm a spoiled San Francisco resident who's used to tons of great tapas places at good prices, both traditional Spanish style & more modern style (Mission district...enough said). \u00a0The more I eat out in London, the more disappointed I am with the food scene. \u00a0I can understand why Londoners would rate this place higher---they are not used to having very good restaurants at affordable prices. \u00a0Had this place been more generous with the portions or priced less per dish, I would have given it 3-3.5 stars. \u00a0Dehasa is incredibly overrated. \u00a0I was still hungry afterwards, and had to eat something more at home. \u00a0I would suggest to anyone coming here to head over to Barrafina instead where the service is superb, the prices reasonable, the portions filling, and the food delicious. \u00a0I won't be coming back to Dehasa.",

London - what the HELLAnyway, we found ourselves desperate and starving in this little place, and I don't regret it one bit. The ambience was cozy, and our waiter was polite and patient, even though some of the people in my party were clearly getting unreasonable and hangry. We started off sampling the charcuterie, which was marvelous - the cuts were not overly salty like so many charcuteries, and had just the right amount of fat to make the meat feel ever so tender in the mouth. For our tapas, we had the squid, the belly pork, and the duck. The squid was by far the best - cooked to perfection in a spicy tomato sauce with chickpeas. The duck and pork belly were tasty as well, with marvelous crackling over the pork. Overall, the food was a solid 4 - not mind blowing, but quite excellent all around. In terms of pricing, we probably ordered a little too much food (9 tapas + charcuterie for 3 people), but we ended up paying around 40 pounds a person, including drinks and food.",

    "text": "If you're strolling around Carnaby Street in the middle of Soho on a weekday evening (any day after Tuesday) and are looking for a spot to eat without a reservation, you're in trouble! We found ourselves in that very spot on a busy summer Wednesday evening. It was drizzling, but the streets were packed with tourists, office goers and everyone else just looking to have a good time. We love Tapas and took a chance and asked Dehesa if they had room for 2. First they told us it was an hour wait and then when we asked if we could hang out at the bar, the host took us to table at the back & said we could use it, if we promised to vacate within an hour (he had another reservation past that). With neck to neck tables, and barely any place to go squeeze in and out between tables, Dehesa \u00a0really is a test of your ego!! We quickly ordered our tapas - Sauteed Prawns with Riso di Venere, Manzanilla Sherry & Toasted Walnuts and the Trofie pasta with Aubergine, Fig, Pine Nuts, Mozzarella and Tomato Sauce. It all sounded very fancy, but looked quite ordinary when it arrived! Not blown away with either of the two plates - the pasta dish was too tomato-y and that overpowered everything else. The prawns were slightly chewy and lacked any real flavors. Prices range between 7-9 GBP as an average.Overall my verdict would be that this is a decent place to grab a few drinks and then move on to someplace else for the food. As an aside, they had a great cheese selection, so might be worthwhile to try it.",

It comes with a whole bottle of tonic so be sure to taste as you pour so not to dilute your gin too much. Service was good and there is great outdoor seating for nice weather. We also tried a few tapas:***padron peppers - so excited to see this on the menu as this was one of my favorite tapas in Spain! This was a popular order and I saw it on most tables***italian charcuterie plate - great for sharing***quail eggs with dried pepper dip",

    "text": "Carnaby street is a huge shopping destination so I often forget about all the lovely little bars and restaurants in the area. Dehesa is one of those places, a lovely little tapas bar at the corner of Ganton Street, great for a glass of wine after shopping or work. You can also select a few tapas dishes to share between your group or if you are quite hungry you can pick the set menu and sample lots of different flavours. I particularly enjoyed the chorizo, the trout and the aubergine as well as the deserts that were all great! If you would like to book the place for a professional occasion you should consider the downstairs dining room that fits about 15 people. We booked it for a company dinner and were all very satisfied with it. The staff were all very attentive and were always trying to make sure everything was ok, while topping up our water and wine.In general everyone had a lovely time, enjoyed the food and drinks and we were also able to have a great discussion without the music being overpowering. I would definitely recommend the place and will have it in mind for future events in the area.",

The outdoor seating area is first come, first served so we missed out on that. We were able to be seated in the main (read: intimate) area and there's also communal seating in the bar.The service was friendly and reasonably efficient. The Sangiovese wine by the glass was nice. Hubby and I ordered the Spanish cheese plate and the Italian charcuterie plate, both of which were outstanding. We also ordered extra bread, which was amazingly delicious. It was the perfect late-day refueling stop. A tip: book ahead if you're visiting for dinner.",

    "text": "I ended up at Dehesa on Friday evening, after my friend and I tried to go to Dishoom in Carnaby at 9 PM, only to hear that there was a 45 minute wait even at that hour. Dehesa is right next door and it is a sister restaurant of Opera Tavern, which I went to a few months ago and had a great time. We didn't have to wait long for seats at a sharing table, which is essentially a long table with groups of 2 seated across from each other in a row (this is similar to Ottolenghi Islington's arrangement). We ordered 2 of the croquettes, the pork belly, braised ox cheeks, crab gnocchi, and grilled portobello mushrooms. The croquettes were great, but the main dishes were marred by the fact that they were served either lukewarm or cold. We sent back the crab gnocchi after my friend asked the waiter if it was meant to be served cold. They brought back another version and it was still partially cold. The food also took an exceptionally long time to come out. And there was no apology on the part of the restaurant. This may have just been a problem with the staffing of the restaurant on that day, or something overlooked by our server, but I was very disappointed with the service. Dehesa is part of a well known group of restaurants and I had high hopes for it, but unfortunately on this occasion it did not deliver.",

Some too salty, some burned, some with not enough flavours.... The best thing there, cold cuts and toast :-)I am not sure if people can taste what they are eating... If you are in the area and craving for Spanish, try to go to barrafina or brindisa. They are much better.. Even coffee is not great... I think the price is quite moderate considering the location.. \u00a0Don't be fooled - you would be much better going elsewhere. Such a shame considering how good the venue once was and also strange considering it is a part of the group which owns many other Spanish place in town.",

It's tiny, and seating is crowded and generally in group-dining style. It's often very difficult to get seated, though once you do, it's worth it. Excellent wine list, with many great Riojas.It has a staircase to the bathroom that may give you vertigo, and often there's a pig's leg propped up on some cutting apparatus in the front right corner. If you're lucky, you can fetch the seat right below it. Because who doesn't want to eat with a pig's hoof dangling above your head.All in all, great tapas, highly recommended. And if the wait is too long, there's never a wait at the Thai restaurant next door. It's not that great, but hey, for an immediate backup, what do you want? It's probably not fair to attribute that to Dehesa, but I don't care, I'm doing it! You gonna stop me?",
