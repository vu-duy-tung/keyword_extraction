    "text": "Stumbled into here by pure chance on an evening out at Covent Garden.Ironically, my friend and I had just come from Paris but had not visited Laduree there. Who knew we'd stop at one while in London?Great location if you're shopping around the market (though my friend and I stopped here in the evening when most of the shops had already closed. Luckily, Laduree was still open).Bought a box of 12 macarons. DELICIOUS flavors. My favourite one was probably the salted caramel one. Mmmmmm...Macarons are on the pricey side (then again, macarons were quite pricey in Paris as well), but totally worth the tasting experience.",

    "text": "My friend introduced me to this place when I went to study abroad in England. The atmosphere of this place was quite friendly. The people there were very helpful and I loved that even if you buy one macaroon, they give you a special clear bag to put it in. It's like they prize each and every macaroon that goes out. In my opinion, it's on the pricey side..one, I believe, was like 1.60 GBP which is around 2.60 USD. Because no one really just gets one, it ends up adding up. Those boxes that they give it to you in if you buy 6 and up are pretty pricey as well.I'll admit that I wasn't hooked when I first tried it. I tried the pistachio and thought it was good but not all that great. I decided to give it one more try and ended up getting the chocolate one. That is when I got HOOKED. Even as I think about it now, my mouth is watering. It's excellent. When I ever go back, I'm definitely coming back here.",

    "text": "To see some pictures of the pretty macaroons please go to my blog:hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  On a sunny and warm afternoon in the middle of Covent Garden it is usually very difficult to get a table somewhere. Surprisingly not at Laduree, which might have to do with their rather astronomical prices for cakes, ice cream and of course its famous macaroons. Laduree is a French luxury tea room chain which has two more subsidiaries in London, the most famous being at Harrods. I don't have a particular sweet tooth so I managed to turn 32 without ever having tried macaroons. The Skinny Bib took it into his culinary hands to introduce me to his favourite sweet snack. For people who are as ignorant as me regarding pastries, macaroons are meringue like cookies with a cream filling. You can get them in loads of different flavour-varieties at Laduree such as chocolate, coffee, lemon, coconut, praline and pistachio among others. We tried the raspberry ( the pink ones, very nice), the salty caramel (too sweet for me, did not get much of the salt), the vanilla (the best by far!) and the green apple (which I didn't get to taste anymore because I was in a sugar coma at this point). Mini macaroons cost you 1.80 each and the normal sized ones 3.90. We also had to try one of the cakes, this very elaborate piece of multi-layered chocolate cake was very pretty, extremely chocolaty, incredibly rich and very expensive (6-7). On the upside you can probably share this piece between 4 and still be sated. There was coconut ice cream and passion fruit sorbet hidden below this huge amount of whipped cream (excusez moi, creme chantilly). Nice, but nothing to write home about. You can't beat the location, particularly on a sunny day and it is THE place to take your parents when they visit for a weekend. Will I be a regular customer? Very likely not as I would have to invest in a new wardrobe a couple of sizes bigger at the same time. I don't think macaroons, as lovely as they are, are quite worth this.",

    "text": "Laduree has always had it's golden little store in Piccadilly and a concession in Harrods but now we are lucky enough to have a restaurant/tea room/terrace to frequent. And boy what a sweet treat. Set in the heart of Covent Garden, on the corner of luxe feeling 'market place' one can easily find this haven of sweet offerings and delights. Downstairs lays the counter of dreams. Lined with an exquisite spectrum of macaroons and pastries. Ice creams are also available with mini macaroons on top in sumptuous flavours. All can be taken away or gift wrapped (obvos not le ice cream). Being a Laduree connoisseur, I headed upstairs to the tea rooms and terrace area. Greeted by a very Parisian style bar and a matre d, we were offered any table we liked, which sadly didn't include the terrace as this is only for people eating lunch. It didn't really cause upset as inside was delightfully decorated to perfection. We chose to sit beneath a canopy of white silk, on a plumped up velvet sofa. The room is all fireplace, marble, ornate and Louis VI style. Cockatoo printed wallpaper, baby blue wooden panelling, gold leaf and just general loveliness. Tables are small but neatly styled with crockery and the like. Menu was extensive for a tearoom and took me and Legs 11 ages to decipher what to have. Settled on iced mint tea and raspberry, strawberry/mint and blackcurrant/lavender macaroons. Utter mouth sex. Loved. Wanted all the flavours but had little to no monies left after this splurge. And a spend it is but oh so worth it. I will dine soon. Which brings me to say, there is an outside, heated/covered area in the main piazza to dine in as well but you might as well come upstairs if you are as its much more special. Service was excellent and not as French and rude as one would expect. They are all French though. Bogs were a huge let down though. Expected a servant type attendant to hand me and towel etc. Nope, one loo. But I forgave this.",

Anyway, back to the Macarons!My fave include: Rose, ORANGE BLOSSOM (Melt in your mouth goodness), The grape-cinnamon is a new flavour and quite delicious, Vanilla is a staple, the coconut is good, but too subtle, you can barely taste the coconut unless you get a bit of it in a bite. The staff is friendly, but even if they were mean it wouldn't matter because the macarons are so tasty I would probably go through a gauntlet in order to eat them. The cute little boxes they give you is also pretty adorable and perfect to take away and continue about your day. I Heart you Ladure\u00e9!",

I've been waiting patiently across the Atlantic for the day to come - the day I can finally experience the finest macaron of it's class - a Ladur\u00e9e macaron. To say that I had high expectations - would be an absolute understatement. I had the Mt. Everest of expectations. I expected everything from this one bite-sized pretty patty and nothing less of an eye-widening, finger gripping orgasm that would send the loudest of silent screams straight to the moon and back again. It's safe to say...My first bite in to that caramel flavored macaron... was NOTHING.. and EVERYTHING \u00a0all at once. On June 20th, while standing upon the worn steps of Convent Garden... I fell in love. The texture, the filling, the flavor - it was perfect, it was harmonious, it was LOVE. The patisseries of Ladur\u00e9e are the composers, and the macarons were their symphonies. For I am only disappointed.. that I can't frequent Ladur\u00e9e often. How am I to ever look at macarons the same way again..",

I was so lucky to have the Coffee one for breakfast the next day and Lemon I was able to smuggle it on the plane with me to NYC.

Although they're quite pricey, the macarons are always a lovely treat to enjoy in moderation. Perfect texture, color, and taste (not too sweet or artificial). They're probably the best I've had, and I couldn't not bring them back to the States for my mom to try. My flat mate, who didn't initially like macarons, was converted in part thanks to Laduree! :) I've also tried the eclairs, which were also delicious (not too sweet, stiff or soggy) and had gold specks!The location is perfect (in the midst of shops and hustle and bustle) and the interior, although small, is just gorgeous. It's really a quaint, cute place. The service was also friendly and polite, and I never really felt rushed even when there was a line.

I'll try any macaron once, and more than a million times if it's done right. Having just been treated to a box of Paul's macarons, we couldn't resist stopping by Laduree to have some more. We were greeted briefly (amongst a crowd) and picked up just enough to keep us hungry before dinner. We sampled the Ginger Yuzu (yummy, but could use a bit more ginger), pink peppercorn (just enough bite and spice without being attacking your palate with pepper), gingerbread (the smell enough sends me back to my childhood in Michigan during Christmas), and rose petal (which was thankfully not too fragrant). We took them to go, but observed plenty of people seated and enjoying themselves under a tent outside the shop. Maybe next time we'll stay, but the idea of a long walk and a Laduree bag in hand is too good to resist.",

    "text": "My first experience with Laduree was on a rainy afternoon in Paris. My friend (who has lived in Paris) told me about their wonderful macarons and suggested that I go while I was there for a couple of days. We picked up a pack of twelve. We had a few then, and they were wonderful.We wandered around Paris, and we saw some great new things (even though it was raining incredibly hard). We wandered to Montmartre and saw the steps in Amelie as well as the cafe from Amelie. (It was a very Amelie day.) Later in the afternoon we finished the macarons, and while they had melted, they were still amazing.Then I find out there are several Laduree stores in London. I've been to the Covent Garden store a couple of times to pick up macarons. While the macarons are still wonderful, there is just something different about them than they are in Paris. Maybe it's just traveling in Paris and being there that makes them taste so different. While I can completely recommend these delicious treats to anyone, I would also recommend more to go to Paris and have them there.",

    "text": "First of all, I'd like to say that I have limited exposure to macarons (I've tried them from perhaps five different places), and I'm not their biggest fan (I don't have a large sweet tooth, and they're mostly sugar). That being said, Laduree's are the tastiest I've had by far. I didn't actually go to Laduree myself. My brother was backpacking in Europe, and right before he came home from London, he bought a dozen of Laduree's macarons to bring home for us. He told us we should eat them all that night, because after 24 hours, they start going stale. He put them in the fridge as soon as he got home, and he told us we were supposed to wait 10 minutes after taking them out of the fridge before eating them. We did not wait the prescribed 10 minutes. We waited about two or three minutes. He bought a variety of flavors, so we cut them up and each had a taste. Some of those flavors included caramel, melon (limited time summer flavor), Marie Antoinette tea, raspberry, chestnut, vanilla, rose petal, and pistachio. I was quite pleased with the various flavors and fillings. None of them was artificial tasting (I've had orange that was, and it was disgusting). The maracons (outside of the filling), were quite soft. I was surprised. We tried five flavors before we stopped, because they were quite sweet. My mom and I had the rest of them two days later (after they had supposedly gone stale), and we actually enjoyed them more than we had the first time. We ate them straight out of the fridge, and we agreed that they tasted less sweet, which we appreciated. I also liked that the macarons were slightly less soft and chewy, and more crisp.I can't say I'll go to Laduree myself, because I have no immediate plans to travel to Europe, but should someone bring some more back for me, I'm game to try more flavors!",

Criticisers background also affect the review. It's hard yes but you try to be objective. Unfortunately I have two bad experiences with Ladur\u00e9e-Covent Garden. Last time I called them up for a reservation of 5 ( inc a baby). I'd like to book for afternoon tea but lady told me that only lunch reservations are taken. Ok! I said my guests might be interested of having lunch but I'm not quite sure and I don't want to sit outside due to having a baby. She was kind enough to say she will speak to the staff to arrange a table. When we arrived to the place a member of staff told us that he is aware of my call and showed our table. My guests also agreed to have lunch. After a minute he said \"sorry but I have to arrange this table who booked for lunch. They suppose spend \u00a330 each\". He asked to leave the table and wait for 10-15 mins with our baby outside!!! I do not want to mention how much \u00a0afternoon tea menu was What's the difference from lunch menu etc. I'm not a person that who is willing to give one star. But after all experience this place deserves no more than this. So, how nicely designed the place, how nice their display or how beautiful their macarons do not matters. \u00a0I've been to all Ladur\u00e9e s in London and Paris. I haven't seen any \u00a0ignorant or bad management in any of the other. They have lots to learn!",

Also the surrounding was beautiful so that we had a really pleased stay. Would totally come again and buy some more delicious macarons!",

    "text": "If you're looking for somewhere for a quick sweet treat then look no further than Ladur\u00e9e in Covent Garden.This is the patisserie's first stand-alone tea salon in the capital, serving savoury snacks and champagne as well as sweet treats and those signature macarons. I popped in a couple of weeks ago before dance class to enjoy some of their famous macarons and take in the beautiful surroundings.Given its location it can be fairly busy so you may need to wait for a table but trust me when I say it will be worth the wait. This is a luxury establishment with a traditional decor that enhances your experience. They also have an outdoor terrace which I'm sure is wonderful in the summer months for a spot of people watching!I didn't want anything too heavy before my class so I didn't go for anything savoury instead choosing to try their delightfully thick hot chocolate and two of their mini macarons; petale de rose and Strawberry Guimauve (that's rose petal and strawberry marshmallow to you and me) but more on those later.The hot chocolate at Ladur\u00e9e is seriously thick, almost like you're drinking melted chocolate. It's silky smooth and slightly bitter as it's made with only the best quality dark chocolate so if you have a sweet tooth you might not enjoy this. It comes in a tiny silver pot almost like a milk jug and there's more than enough for two cups in each one so it's possible to share. For some reason I haven't quite figured out hot chocolate with cream is cheaper than without but it is in fact the exact same hot chocolate recipe. Go figure!Now on to the macarons!Traditionally macarons are matured for two days and you can tell when they are at their freshest as when you pinch it between your forefinger and thumb they bounce rather than crack. Rose, violet or lavender are usually my go to flavours so I thoroughly enjoyed the rose petal one which was lovely and light without being overpowering but the star was the strawberry marshmallow. As you leave why not pick up a couple extra from the counter to take away with you?",

I ended up getting one pistachio and one marie antoinette - and both were absolutely phenomenal. The shells were the perfect mix of crunchy and soft, and the filling was amazing for both - although I did like the marie antoinette a tad bit more.

    "text": "As lovely and delicious as these historic macarons are -- and I assure you that those little delectable treats are worth the price -- the service here is just terrible for the price point involved and I can no longer give this particular location my business.Let me start by saying that there is absolutely no bad flavour to get here. \u00a0They are all incredible. \u00a0Particularly the caramel with sea salt. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Loved the seasonal chocolate flavour, as well as the pistachio. \u00a0But the counter service is bad, the staff is ignorant, the tea service is ugh, etc. \u00a0Were it just for the food, Laduree would get all of my 5 happy stars. \u00a0Alas..._______________Read on for anything but macarons:1. \u00a0The woman at the macaron counter would not give me her stapler so I could attach my receipt to the gift box I was getting. \u00a0Weird.2. \u00a0The same woman was confused about the special gift boxes available to be packed with assortments. \u00a0And she had no recommendations as to what flavours I should put in the box. \u00a0I also felt her attitude was quite condescending.3. \u00a0Perhaps I'm just a rude American with no manners, but it really is odd that you cannot eat your macarons in the outdoor patio, once you have paid for them inside at the counter. \u00a0Rather, you must buy the macarons at the table, which are then brought to you on a plate. \u00a0I was not told this rule when I told a Laduree employee inside, during my macaron purchase, that I intended to enjoy some tea outside with my tasty treats. \u00a0And I was not told this rule while I ordered tea with the expressed intention of drinking it alongside my sweet macaron snack. \u00a0It wasn't until after I had my tea placed in front of me that I was told of this \"rule.\" \u00a0I did feel quite duped by this whole situation.4. \u00a0You cannot sit upstairs on the balcony unless you are getting the full tea service. \u00a0There must have been some miscommunication here when another employee (inside at the counter again) told me that I could \"definitely\" sit upstairs, and I could easily just ask an attending waiter as to my seating preference. \u00a0It was not very busy at all and I'm still puzzled by this policy.5. \u00a0The ambiance is lacking. \u00a0A cheap show is always rousing up some noise outside. \u00a0So the soothing pastels and calming notion of sipping quality teas does absolutely nothing to distract you from the tacky jugglers heckling the public when they don't get enough \"donations\" for a \"quality\" show. \u00a0Not to mention that one of the heated awnings is broken. \u00a0And the seating by the roped partitions is tight (forcing you to jump the ropes in order to leave your table if you don't want to awkwardly brush up against a stranger). \u00a0I do not intend to eat or drink here in the future.6. \u00a0This seems a bit obvious, since the macarons ARE Laduree's selling point, but ONLY the macarons are worth it. \u00a0They are the only good thing served here. \u00a0The other desserts and treats here are lacking... significantly. \u00a0A \u00a37 cupcake with \"pistachio icing and blackcurrant filling\" stuck to the wrapper, was dry and crumbly, and flavourless despite the description. \u00a0Supersuper disappointed in one of the most expensive cupcakes of my life.7. \u00a0Lastly, I had dirty silverware. \u00a0That pretty much solidified the terrible experience for me.",

    "text": "My friends and I visited UK back in September and both of them really want to try out the afternoon tea, therefore, we went to Laduree to try out the its afternoon tea. We ordered 3 different types of afternoon teas (finger food, cake, and macaroons) and the waiter messed up our order 3 times..... They gave us the wrong amount of finger food, wrong flavor of cakes and macaroons..... Not sure what was the reason. Personally I think their dessert it's more on a sweeter side (way too sweet for my friends (both girls are big sweet tooth and still too sweet for them) and I). Overall, the quality of the taste is there, but I wouldn't go again unless my other friends want to try it out.",

She managed to get us a table on the terrace with less than 5 minutes of waiting on a Friday afternoon. Brilliant!Love their macarons of course. I had the caramel and pistachio macarons with fresh grapefruit juice. On another day I would have had a coffee but it was a particularly hot (and rare) summer day so I was surviving on a potion of iced water and juice. The pistachio macaron was yummy. Caramel macaron was good as well but didn't hold ground compared to the pistachio. Nice amount of crunch and soft. I had read reviews about snobby service but I had a great experience with the staff..they were friendly and fun!",

Then I went to Ladur\u00e9e (in NYC) and realize the ones I had before were just poorly made macarons. But in Ladur\u00e9e, the flavours and textures are lovely. They are still pretty sweet but it's in a more delicate and complex way that's actually enjoyable. Came here for the afternoon tea set on the terrace and that wasn't a great idea on a winter day. It was a bit too cold, and the sun was glaring into my eyes. The service was quite slow, and like many yelpers mentioned it could be a bit more friendly. While the desserts are lovely, it was just too much sugar to consume in one sitting. I'd come back here for the macarons but not the tea.",

    "text": "Laduree boasts the best macaroons in town and from past experience of buying a box here and there I have always found them to be delicious. I had not yet though been for the full tea and macaroons evening so I was quite happy when my best friend suggested we go there for tea on my birthday. Being a total girl for a minute, I am a huge sucker for pastel tea cups, vintage decor and pretty colourful sweets. Laduree checks all of the above with the added bonus of it all being French and delicate. Fittingly, their signature tea and macaroon flavour are called Marie Antoinette. So while you let them have cake you can get down to eating all of the yummy macaroons.The Marie Antoinette tea's main flavours are citrus and rose with a honey aftertaste. It's a strange taste at first but you get used to it and by the end you will me up loving it. The corresponding macaroon is more caramel and vanilla based so in my opinion the rose flavoured one is a much better match and my personal favourite. There is certainly a difference in flavour when you have the macaroons at the venue instead of buying the boxes. They did taste very fresh and even yummier than usually if that is even possible. Basically if you're looking for a girly afternoon with your friends you should go there.",

    "text": "Ladur\u00e9e, among other things, is a master of macarons. Whatever other french people might say (dad, I'm thinking of you), and although Len\u00f4tre invented them, Ladur\u00e9e's ARE the best in the world. I hadn't had macarons in a while so I decide to pop in the store and try out Ladur\u00e9e abroad. Gladly, it tasted the same. My favourites are lemon, rose, vanilla and raspberry but this time they had replaced the raspberry by candy raspberry and the vanilla by rum-vanilla. The first one wasn't to my taste, too marshmallowy, but the vanilla enhanced with a touch of rum was absolutely divine. if you ever get the chance, have the Ispahan. It's a big pink dessert made with a big macaron, litchi and raspeberry. It's probably one of my favourite patisserie. Regrettably they didn't have my favourite vanilla tea anymore but if you get the chance, try it on site or to take away. They sell all their teas in cute round boxes. Service was neat and precise as always.",

    "text": "NY finally got its first Laduree 2 years ago but with 45min wait times and expensive prices I have yet to try a macaron from the famous place. But when my bf and I were in London recently we accidentally stumbled upon their Covent Garden store and decided to try their famous confections. I love meringue in all forms and I love macarons. My bf knows this so he's brought home macarons from various places. I must admit Laduree's macarons are quite exceptional. Specifically their pistachio macaron is stellar. I don't usually like pistachio because the flavor comes off artificial but Laduree's is excellent. I also loved the cassis macaron and the marshmallow filled ones. I'll definitely have to give in and splurge on a box once in a while.",

It's the texture of the airy and light cookies that sandwich flavorful fillings that I'm addicted to. As a matter of fact, these were so airy and light that some broke in the bag while I took a picture of a Covent Garden street performer just outside. If you're not going to finish your macarons, I'd suggest a box (\u00a312.80 for a box of 8). Otherwise, they're \u00a31.60 each. Inside, true to the Parisian cafe experience/perception, the French pastries were mesmerizing. Also true to the Parisian cafe experience/perception the worker had a snotty attitude and wouldn't explain what some of the pastries were. The person the next day was more helpful.Here's what we shared, *Caramel with sea salt - Rich complex depth. Mrs G's favorite*Strawberry candy marshmallow - (New line). Crisp, fluffy, smooth = amusing*Blackcurrant & violet - Classic *Pistachio \u00a0*Strawberry & poppy - Interesting combo *Pure origin Ghana chocolate - Deep and earthy, almost spicy cocoa flavor*Cherry blossom - interesting*Lemon - vibrant, good balance of sweet/tart*Milk chocolate *Rose petal - \u00a0Like eating potpourri, not a fanUntil I make my macaron pilgramage to Paris for Pierre Herm\u00e9, Jean-Paul Hevin, Sadaharu Aoki, etc. Laduree's macarons's are excellent and are going to be my new reference point.",

The cookies didn't break when handled but still crumbled perfectly. And they weren't too sweet! The filling is where THE MAGIC IS AT. I don't know how they pack so much flavor into such a tiny thing but they just do. And it's fantastic.Flavor recommendations: caf\u00e9, lemon, and lavender..Don't buy macarons anywhere else, they'll just be disappointing in texture and flavor, but just as expensive. (I know from experience; 3 different macarons shops elsewhere in London) Wait for Ladure\u00e9, it's worth it!",

Location-This place has been open for many years and is just as busy as when it first opened (at least every time I visit. I love this location because you can people watch and see the street performers out front.2. Seating - Not all Ladur\u00e9e locations worldwide have a cafe but this one does. The seating is limited but very Parisian and cute. 3. Decor - The decor is very cute and perfect if you have a young daughter. She would love it 4. Sentimental - This was actually the first Ladur\u00e9e store I ever visited when I was younger so it holds a sentimental place in my heart. 5. Food - Truthfully I only like their macaroons and not much of anything else on their menu. Particularly I like their pistachio macaron. But their other deserts are quite pretty and popular so for sure try them at least once. Cons: 1. If you order macaroons from downstairs and try to eat them in the restaurant they offer, they will charge you an extra .50p. Ugh! 2. Renovation is highly needed. 3. Small location- My husband and I visited the cafe and he felt like he was in a doll house. Everything felt smaller to him (ceiling height, space, furniture) so he felt very cramped. He has to turn sideways due to his shoulders being too wide and even at our table count fit his legs under the table so he put them on the sides (like he had the table in an abductor press lol) This might be an issue if you have a guy with you :p. Also in the winter there isn't a lot of place to put your coat and scarves in addition to your purse. Still one of my favorite Laduree locations. Def stop by!",

I'm not sure if it's Bc it's in such a touristy location, so maybe they can get away with poor service and unprofessional attitudes and mediocre products, but do not come here!I popped into the shop, with a simple and quick order of 2 \u00a0boxes. The girls behind the counter looked messy and tired, didn't look polished or friendly. They got my order together, no frills, no fuss, which was totally fine. The credit card machine was down, after 10 min of trying to fix it they reclaimed my macarons and said to go out into the Cold and wait in the eating area. Upstairs was full. Upon going outside, the man was annoying and got my order wrong. He was hasty and gave me a dirty cup and brought out hot chocolate instead of coffee. He was also frustrated that I had a baby stroller which wasn't inconveniencing anyone but himself. He made me take the stroller around the ways on the cobblestone which woke my baby up, everyone knows this is the most annoying thing that could possibly happen when trying to have a quick break.",

I had an amazing time and I also enjoyed breakfast on the patio of Laduree, overlooking it all. The baked goods were to die for and the scrambled egg with smoked salmon was so good! The portion was larger than I expected so I obviously ordered a croissant as a side but it was all so good so no regrets there.

Delicately flavoured macaroon shells held together by an equally delicate filling, each bite is like biting into a bit of heaven.A plate of macaroons, a pot of hot tea (without sugar) and a seat at their outdoor table on a clear day is sheer bliss for me.However, on this last occasion, my sister & I picked up a box of 8 and shared it between us as we meandered across Covent Garden spacing each one at least 5 minutes apart, so as to enjoy the individual flavours.",

There is no area for waiting and they don't put your name on a list or give you a buzzer or some other way in which you can walk around covent garden until your table is ready. I would say that was the biggest issue I had with the place. Once you get seated you can enjoy some nice macarons, tea, and champagne",

It was difficult to get the check because after we finished eating, we were left alone for a long period of time, but before that the service was more tentative. Overall the service is very friendly. The food was very good but very expensive for what it was. I'm not well versed in tea so I did not particularly enjoy the tea. The best part was my dessert. The macaron was the perfect texture with a crispy shell on the outside and soft on the inside, complimented perfectly with strawberries and raspberries. The size was perfect for two people. Don't get seated near the restroom! The door is extremely disruptive and annoying because it slams shut everything someone opens or closes it. Worst part of the whole experience. Ask to sit outside instead.",

These are the best macarons I have ever had, made with the highest quality ingredients. They aren't cheap but they are completely worth it.",
