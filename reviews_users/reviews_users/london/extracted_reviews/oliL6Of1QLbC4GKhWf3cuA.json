    "text": "Came for the afternoon tea which I have to say, was a really disappointing experience. The staff however were extremely accommodating and friendly. We came early for our booking and they were really kind in finding us a table in spite of a quite full restaurant. When the afternoon tea arrived it looked just like the picture in the homepage - inviting and delicious. Unfortunately the lovely display was just for show. The sandwiches were dry, the tea lukewarm and the cakes were uninteresting. The best part was the brownie bite (not bites - as there were only one) which was quite nice and chocolate rich. The sandwich filling was completely lacking taste. \u00a0So unfortunately the food was a boring experience. The restaurant itself had a lovely decor- very bright and welcoming. Another thing we found extremely annoying was the sound level of the music. It was so loud it actually made it impossible to have a conversation. Looking at the constant flow of guests I hope we were just unlucky with our food - however that made our visit quite disappointing and I will not be returning. With such a vast number of lovely eateries in London I see no reason to return to a place which in my view was at best mediocre.",

The plates are very cute as well, felt like they would suit a Cathy Kidson store. Decoration is simple but very pleasant.We were a party of 3 and shared a breakfast type platter with scotch egg, cheese, bread and some other ingredient which I have unfortunately forgotten now. The scotch egg is my highlight so far, it's very light and melty inside and I was a happy bunny. It was huge as well, I ate only a quarter!!We ordered a slice of carrot cake and it was massive, 3x the normal small ish cakes you would get in other cafes, and it also did not disappoint, it was soo nice. There is no more reason to go to Paul and fight with the crowd in there anymore. This place is so much more pleasant and the food and much more worth it.They serve arizona peach ice tea, this is an amazing drink...I'm looking into sourcing this for my home...heheheheSpoke to a friend about this place, they said there is a table with swings here, not noticed this but next time I'm definitely checking it out.",

This is not to say the food was particularly bad but neither was it of a standard to match the effort they have put into the ambience, which is a great shame.The lack of effort they put into the food is probably a symptom of getting enough tourist trade that the quality of food does not have to attract repeat business.The place is usually pretty quiet for breakfast during the week but very busy for brunch and lunch at the weekend. The d\u00e9cor makes it a pleasant place to spend an hour if you are stopping for a cake or coffee but expect average food if you need something a bit more filling.",

The ambiance is simply amazing, the food is great and the service is superb :) we were sitting at the table by the window and the theme is like a garden setting where our chairs are those lil swings you would only see in those fancy backyards in the movies. As we were enjoying our dinner we were swinging with the beat of the music they were playing (good selection btw). One of the most relaxing dinners I have had.

It feels like big fake charade to me. Even the numerous plants are fake... They say they are modern European, but don't even serve Fresh mint tea. In fact, even don't know what it is..The service is too much in your face/back/everywhere. Never thought I would ever say this, but they were too attentive. Or maybe not even attentive, but kind of all over you.In terms of the food - well, it wasn't bad, but nothing breath taking or wonderful... Nothing that would invite me back.. Reminded me of school dinners, but ok tasting. Especially when I got pieces of turkey cut on precise thin slices. Call me crazy, but I think there is something wrong about uniform looking food.. It's getting potatoes in separate bowl etc.. As petty as it might seem, when all those little details come together it just feels off.. Oh, I've almost forgotten.. This place is the kingdom of fakery and pretends... I got it now...",

We got a reservation at 6pm and waited to be served. It took about 15-20 minutes for the tray to come and many of the pastries that were advertised were replaced with others. I understand that we got a late reservation but they should have told us that they were replacing them. I'm not so annoyed with the initial wait and replacement of pastries as I am with the service, or lack there of, when we tried to leave. The waiters completely ignored us when we tried to ask for the bill! We asked multiple times to get the bill and were repeatedly told that it would be printed out soon. We were sitting right next to the cash register! The waitress we asked printed out 3 different bills for other tables during our wait. A transaction that could have taken 3-5 mins was prolonged to 20-30 minutes. The servers completely neglected us since we were a party of two and they felt they wouldn't get tipped. I just don't understand why they would not let me pay?! Horrible service!! I would never go back and I greatly advise small parties to stay clear of this place.",

The sandwiches were scrumptious. Salmon, avocada, chicken, and egg salad; I could shove these down my mouth all day long. Yum!The scones were also phenomenal, fresh tasting and served with a scrumptious clotted cream and strawberry jam.The sweets were just ok in my view. There were a few mousse/jello type desserts we didn't care for, and the mince pie and pound cake were also unremarkable but fine.There is a selection of about 6 or so teas to choose from. Everyone also gets a min berry smoothie.The ambience in the restaurant is perfect for afternoon tea. Rustic, cozy, and laid-back, it was very pleasant to sip tea here.

Also the tomato bruschetta was amazing and freshly made. The place was also clean and the ambience was chill. Definitely somewhere to go for brunch.",

    "text": "The decor in this place is beautiful - it's light, summery and super girly. I'd say the food is also aimed at those with a delicate / feminine palate as its heavy on the salads and light on the carbs. I enjoyed a 'combination plate' of salad, which is a choice of 4 salads for \u00a39.99. This included butternut squash and feta, smoked aubergine, winter slaw and carrot and kale salad. The portions are massive and I must say I got a bit bored halfway through. There's a limit to how much salad a girl can eat!However, it's great value for money, service is swift and it was bright and empty. If you're into healthy food with lots of gluten free and vegan options you'll love it as much as my friend did. If not, you'll still love the prices as \u00a39.99 for a decent sized meal is great value in the Soho area.",

    "text": "A delightful place this is.A good starting point for your Sunday brunch, morning breakfast and casual retreat for coffee, buns, cakes and whatnot with friends.They say first impressions count more than most other things. The feeling you get when you look in from the outside, and more importantly when you walk in do in this case hit all the right spots. Cozy, friendly and with a bit of grandma's love, this is a simple yet extremely welcoming place.I've only come here for mid morning breakfast on a weekend, when coffee rules the first few hours of my day and am less inclined to indulge in a feast. For this, it did what I wanted, they provided decent coffee (Southern Europeans may look away now as it might not be up to their standards) and some delightfully yummy morning grub, including some lovely buns, sandwich and viennoiserie. I'm one for a juice in the morning and their energy packed fresh juices really do go down well.Overall, I'd go again, especially when the cold is present and the weather uninspiring for anything but indoor activities.Oh, and they do wifi which is great to share a shot of yourself on social enjoying the warmth, the food and the drinks.",

I love tea and cake, so most places that bring me what I want, it's tasty, and without dropping it are going to get a pretty high score from me. Staff were pleasant but a little flustered, tea was lovely, and the cake was the size of bunting flags- definitely recommended for cake!",

On approach we weren't confident as we were a group of 6 and they looked busy. However when we got to the door we were promptly seated and told that just ordering coffee and cakes were fine!The restaurant is much bigger inside than it appears and it has a fresh welcoming decor, think summer park! The seats are well placed and there are spaces for groups or couples.We ordered a selection of desserts accompanied with either coffee or smoothies. The deserts were really good, generous portions (great to share) and very tasty. The drinks were all well made and it all turned up pretty quickly.The service was also very attentive, we were well looked after without being pressured. I took a quick look over the menu while I was in, and plan on coming back to try some of the very reasonable prices salads!",
