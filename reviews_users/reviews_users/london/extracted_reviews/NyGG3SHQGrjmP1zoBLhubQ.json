The ladies didn't want to go out for the evening so he and I wandered around the neighborhood and found this place. We were not disappointed. The food, beer, and ambiance was all top notch. I want to go back to London just to go here again.",

If you're going for a drink you're best off going early to get any of their few seats.",

I love the location (near Portobello Road and Westbourne Park), I love the style of the pub and restaurant, i love the atmosphere and most of all i love the food. They have amazing seafood on the menu. Last time i visited i had their venison starter which was delicious and for main i had pumpkin and goats cheese ravioli-i don't often choose pasta dishes when i eat out but i saw someone else eating it and it looked great so i had to try it! Their partridge is gorgeous too though. The food menu is like that of a good restaurant and the prices are to match but then again the food is worth the price you pay here. I would only eat here when i want to (or others want to) treat myself. If you're into cigars then this place would be great for you as i've heard they specialise in Cuban cigars. The bar is quite small but it provides a great atmosphere and in the summer it's perfect to have a pint outside in their out door seating area. There's always a lively local buzz to the place on a warm summers evening.",

THE BEST FISH STEW I'VE EVER HAD ANYWHERE - rich tomato based shellfish broth with all sorts of fish mixed in. Also had the razor clams as a starter and also delicious. My partner had the Crab Tagliolini and if I wasn't full from my lunch I would have eaten that too. It's the kind of meal that one could easily use to rationalize making another costly trip back to London from NYC for. That said, I'd recommend going for lunch when you don't have heaps of happy hour standing over you while you eat your food. And BEWARE: the quaint upstairs dining room does not feature the superb pub menu. They should really change that.",

I personally like Guinness everywhere, but I had a few Irish friends who aren't as open-minded as I am, and were impressed at The Cow being the first place they liked it outside of Ireland.

    "text": "The Cow is probably my favourite pub in London. A typical Irish pub recreated by Tom Conran on the ground floor with a few tables at the back (and a proper restaurant above it). The crowd is different from the Westbourne, more trendy local and less flashy than the Westbourne. The location facing North makes its small terrasse less attractive but there is always a lively crowd around the Cow and lots of activity at the bar where the two most served beers are Red Stripe and Guinness illustrating the mix of Irish and local Carabbean cultures. The menu is small but go there for the sea food, the even have a great sea food platter if you are really hungry.The restaurant above is small but excellent with a great atmosphere and a menu that changes regularly. Booking essential and it is probably quite expensive too (say \u00a345 per head).",

    "text": "Cleverly disguised as a rustic saloon bar, The Cow is actually a fine gastropub serving fresh, inspired food. The interior is small and cozy, with wooden tables pushed closely together, romantic dim lighting, and classic rock tunes playing from an antique jukebox. Eclectic vintage hand painted signs and photo cover the walls. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner, and we were seated immediately. To be completely honest, as a vegan person, I came here with low expectations. Perusing the menu, nearly everything contains meat or fish. However, I was so charmed by the ambience that I was happy to just drink (especially with Guinness now being 100% vegan)!Our server was friendly, and happy to speak to the chef about preparing a vegan meal for me. Fortunately, he was very accommodating, and I received a delicious pasta dish with a bright, slightly spicy tomato sauce that was absolutely incredible. We also got sides of fresh bread and Cornish new potatoes, both of which were excellent and paired perfectly with the food and wine. The high quality of ingredients and expert preparation of the food was evident, and appreciated. To drink we shared a bottle of the Corbieres Syrah, which was lovely and reasonably priced at \u00a334. My boyfriend has been here many times and raves about the Seafood Stew, so if you are not vegan, order that. I look forward to returning the next time I am in London.",

I've always had a crush on him I took a picture in front of his door for shits and giggles and pretty much just ran away with excitement and when I ended up at this bar I happened to mention that I was excited because I was at Robert Pattinson's flat and the entire table got so hungry with me saying that they couldn't stand him And that they were angry that he bought a flat in that area of Notting Hill they thought he was a sell-out doing all of those stupid Twilight movies I agreed with them on that part but when they told me that Robert Pattinson was welcome and there are kind of broke my heartI mean there was good service at this restaurant and some cool people hanging out you can tell me lived around the area I bought a round of drinks and I think I spent about \u00a3110 lol But it ended up evening out because everyone else at the table so thankful to have such great conversation with me that they paid for my shutter particular and drinks for the rest of the eveningI just can't believe London pubs close at 11 PM that's worse than Los AngelesI'm from Las Vegas where booze is available 24 hours a day so it's very hard for me to adapt to the London nightlifeI'm sorry I had to throw in the London drama of my Robert Pattinson story but I couldn't believe that the people that normally go to this pub or heating on to Robert Pattinson so badPlease be nice to him I love himI'm in the New York area right now temporarily he is here all weekI may be on Yelp with some dramatic story if I decide to stalk him this week in New York City I'm undecided",

It started to fill up around 10 PM when we were leaving.My other half and I sat at a communal table, but had it to ourselves until about the time the check arrived. I really enjoyed my Cow Pie, which was a heavenly dish of steak spiked with a Guinness sauce in a flaky crust. My other half had the steak special. I was lucky enough to try a few bites, and it's one of the best steaks I've tasted in London. It was certainly on par with offerings from some of the American steakhouses. The restaurant was so small that one waiter covered the entire floor, yet service was efficient and friendly. They also have a nice wine list. Definitely give it a try sometime!",

Just enjoy the vibe, drink some beers and look forward to the next dish. Value is good with specials mon-thurs. Portions are good too. My only slightly dislike was that the crab pasta was slightly too spicy, but that might just be me. Enjoy !",
