The bone-in prime rib was excellent, not as fatty as American corn fed beef but more tasteful, side dishes and desert are excellent and fast, the waiters knew we're in a hurry and in 1.5 hr we're out with a very satisfying meal. The decor and ambiance was formal yet relaxing, the service was proficient and after a long day of walking around London it's a great place to eat, relax and get ready to see the 7:30 shows. It's a bit overpriced though, for the same steak you can have in NYC for 2/3, and in France for 1/2 the price, but i guess you pay for the location & their excellent service (the staffs & services are as professional as any we've seen), hence the 4 stars.",

    "text": "After trying a couple of steak-houses in London I grew tired of average quality, poorly cooked meat. Fortunately, the Hawksmoor managed to change my mind. Book a table for four at 9.30, had to wait a little in the bar (10 mins) and we're then given the menu. WOW. They don't have extraordinary variety or pretentious complex dishes - just what you want from a steakhouse: a few cuts of wonderful meat. You can get Chateaubriand , Porterhouse, T-Bone, Sirloin, Fillet, D-Rump (aged 55 days!) and Ribeye. A blackboard shows which \"big\" cut is still available and in which weight. Since my friends weren't up for sharing a very big cut, I went for a 750g T-Bone. I have to say, it's hard to beat that meat quality - just amazingly good, marbled to the right point, extremely tender: good job!So, why not 5 stars? Well, when ordering, the waiter asked (of course) how I'd like my steak, and it looked \"confused\" when I asked for it to be rare. A bit disappointing, a steak house should suggest a rare-ish cooking, not act like I'm some sort of alien when I order it like this. Anyway, not much of a problem there, I'm not too much picky on service quality when in a stakehouse. After 40 minutes or so (a bit too much, has to be said) we finally receive our piece of meat - I immediately cut it in the middle and - shame - it's almost cooked to medium: no blood, color is pink, not-so-juicy. On the bright side, the waiter saw my disappointed expression and immediately offered to replace my steak (big +1 to service this time). Unfortunately, since it took 40mins the first time and it was already 10.30pm, I decided to keep it like it was and I must say, even with the wrong cooking, it was amazing!Side note: two of my friends order other cuts cooked rare, and their stake was done properly, so I suppose I was unlucky.Now on the wine side - wine list is quite nourished, varying from South-america to Spain, France and Italy. A bit overpriced but in the average of mid-high level restaurant. They also have a rather good selection of wines by the glass, which is always very welcome if you're dining with someone who's not a wine lover Conclusion: best steak I've had in London so far, looking forward to come again for a properly cooked porterhouse, and maybe a 5-star review!",

    "text": "Oh, as if this even needs to be said. Writing this review feels like the equivalent of a supermodel asking you \"am I pretty?\" YES. YOU ARE GODDAMN GORGEOUS AND YOU KNOW IT. Dudes, that burger is gorgeous. It really is. I was surprised when I was told I could only order it medium or well done. I like my burgers medium rare. But the meat was plenty pink when I got it. The chips were good, too, but honestly the burger is so filling you hardly need them. I washed it all down with a Shaky Pete's, which is one of my new favorite drinks. I wish there were more places I could casually stop in to drink one of these. Mmm. My partner's steak was insane. Since he was going to be eating it alone, he didn't get one of the crazy big cuts, but it was still a lot of meat. He had the mashed potatoes, as well, which were whipped to perfection. I can't even say anything here that hasn't been covered. Monday night is BYO \u00a35 corkage fee, so if you're looking to try the burger but you're on a budget, I'd recommend getting there early to get a table at the bar and bringing your own wine. I'm trying to space out my visits for the sake of not being a fat drunk (seriously, the shaky petes pack a legitimate booze punch), but, along with everyone else. I'd recommend Hawksmoor. Five stars because the staff is so welcoming and awesome and, for a slightly more expensive dining option, I didn't feel totally out of place walking in with my fashion backpack filled with gym clothes. The vibe is really chilled out.",

The large round tables and expansive dining room just lend themselves to conversation (and sharing!)After multiple visits, I'm firm in the belief that Hawksmoor do the best Sunday roast in London. Think thick slabs of Longhorn beef rump, all the vegetable trimmings (plus huge Yorkshire puds!) and gravy that's absolutely bursting with umami.On my last visit, four of us split two Sunday roasts with added sides of macaroni cheese, beef dripping chips, buttered spinach and the English lettuce and herb salad, plus puddings, and there was plenty of food to go around. The food is faultless but the bloody marys can be uneven and if you like yours spicy you'll need to ask for the Tabasco and generously apply. I partook of the bottomless bloodies and the first one arrived beautifully done with a salt rimmed glass. The subsequent ones? Not so much. Hawksmoor could stand to apply some consistency in this department.Booking is essential. After all, this is the best Sunday lunch in town!",

Truly an exceptional restaurant and well worth the price tag.Started with the infamous Shaky Petes shandy cocktail and Seasonal cobbler which were outstanding.The crab on toast reignited my love for the dish where previous restaurants have failed miserably. Even the simple garnish salad was special. The Tamworth ribs fell apart in my mouth like a dream but were surprisingly spicy.We ordered the bone in prime rib. 850grams was enough for us and was simply devine. Smokey bark on the outside and juicy in the middle. The macaroni cheese was a particular highlight of the sides, every mouthful was better than the last.Staff were super attentive and knowledgable, were always there when you needed them and never when you didn't. Atmosphere was buzzing but not rowdy despite being essentially fully booked on a Monday night.One of my all time favourites. A real special place.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor Seven Dials was the last Hawksmoor I needed to complete the collection, and ,when I saw the email advertising their Christmas Turkey Burger as the 3rd burger special, I knew the time had come to try it.I had arranged to meet a friend there before we headed off to see a play but of course, true to form, I was delayed at work by a last minute assignment. I was further delayed by the lack of cycle parking around the place and instead had to cross a couple more streets before bike racks finally made an appearance. Seriously Seven Dials, what's going on? If any place in London should cater to a cycle over car area, I would think it would be you! I had told her to order for me when she got there as we'd be pushed for time otherwise and this almost ended up being the burger's undoing. Hawksmoor's kitchen is pretty damn efficient and served up the food within 10 minutes of ordering. The problem was, I only arrived just under 30 minutes from the order being placed (my fault, not Hawksmoor's) but they couldn't take it back to the kitchen and keep under the heat lamps as the kitchen was too busy.So when I finally arrived and persuaded the hostess to let me go to the bar (slight issue as she was admanant you couldn't walk into the bar and sit down despite my friend having done so just 30 mins before and having saved me a seat), my burger was waiting for me. It was still warm and juicy and was quite possibly the best turkey burger I've ever had. Two breaded slices of turkey breast cooked perfectly and retaining a massive amount of moisture and flavour. The bacon was there in body but not in taste and I could have skipped it without noticing. The demi-brioche bun used by Hawksmoor was delicious as usual. My main gripe was the roast potatoes served with the burger (come on...burgers should always comes with chips - this is an option but not the default). The roast potatoes lacked flavour and were slightly undercooked so quite a let down from an otherwise great meal.Extra bonus points to the bartender who, after noticing my food was waiting for 20 minutes without me, made me an old fashioned on the house. Excellent customer service with absolutely no expectation on my part or obligation on theirs, and an instance that will always remain a bright spot in my memory of the experience. At \u00a315, it's expensive for any burger and even more so for a turkey burger so in the value for money rating it takes a hit. Taste-wise, the burger has it going on but some failings (bacon and potatoes) hurt it. Customer service was top notch for the bar staff but a bit iffy for the hostess. So overall, I think 3 stars for you Hawksmoor Seven Dials. I've had incredible experiences at your sibling restaurants so I expect more from you.",

The service is second to none, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. \u00a0No rush to get you to your table, a relaxed have a drink at the bar approach. \u00a0The restaurant has a factory chic architecture. A place where you can be dressed to impress or casual. The cocktails were great. We had a table for 7, none of our group were squashed we all had plenty of room. As the order was taken after explaining the steak choices it became apparent the waitress knew where to place the food without asking on her return with our order, very professional. \u00a0So yes the service is spot on. I dropped my knife and I picked it up and put it back on the table, without prompting a waiter discreetly appeared and changed my knife without fuss.I ordered the Bone-in prime rib to share with my friend, OMG it was so juicy with a deep steak meat flavor I can honestly say it's the best I've ever had, seriously. \u00a0We ordered Sirloin, Rump and ribeye all were just as fantastic in size, quality, taste and deliciousness. For sides we ordered beef dripping fries, triple cooked chips, macaroni cheese and bone marrow. The beef dripping fries were devine. I wanted to try the bone marrow but I would not order again. The side sauces of bernaise sauce, anchovy hollandaise and marrow gravy again nice.So if you want the best of the best in steak go to Hawksmoor. Xoxo",

It was well worth the walk and wait. The meat was delicious, especially with the house gravy on the side. It came with a giant Yorkshire pudding, a roasted half garlic, a roasted leak, saut\u00e9ed carrots, crispy fried potatoes and lightly saut\u00e9ed sprouts. The service was prompt and attentive. All in all, more than worth the 20\u00a3. The wine and spirit list is extensive and there is also a full bar. You should put this restaurant on your list to visit when in Central London. By the way, if you go there for Sunday roast, it's best to get there by 5 PM.",

You could probably share one between two of you, although whether you want to share that yummy bone marrow sauce is debatable. The Yorkshire puddings were bigger than my hand and the roast potatoes are sheer perfection. Probably also get the triple cooked chips. You will be stuffed completely, and walking straight might become a slight problem but WHO CARES? \u00a0It's great chips, and there is nothing as heart breaking as chip-regret. The service was also awesome. I loved the waiters' Hawaiian-esque T-shirts against all that polished brass and wood. SO, go now. And then go again. It's not cheap but it's so worth it. Hawksmoor truly lives up to its reputation.",

Then came the food. \u00a0Oh, the food. \u00a0I started with the belly ribs. \u00a0I could have eaten them all night. \u00a0So utterly lush, melting in your mouth, barbecue goodness. Seriously, heaven on earth. \u00a0My husband went with the crab on toast and he thought the flavours were divine. \u00a0Portion sizes were perfect, taking off the edge of hunger, but not enough to fill you up. \u00a0We then decided to share a steak and choose a t-bone from the board. \u00a0Perfectly smokey, medium rare as ordered and gorgeously marbled. \u00a0One of the best steaks I've had in London. \u00a0We couldn't quite finish the steak, but came close.This is a wonderful treat, made even better by the service and atmosphere. \u00a0I'll be back!",

No drinks... The starters were really great... No drinks.Waitress arrived about 10 mins later. \u00a0Re ordered drink.Main arrived 5 mins later.My ribeye was really nice, but not much better than I could make at home (Costco steaks are pretty good quality). \u00a0My wife's fillet was under cooked by medium standards (frustrating). \u00a0Polite enough she didn't ask that it be returned.Third round of drinks came promptly enough. Main finished and we ordered the sticky toffee pudding which was really nice.We ordered the beef dripping fries and the sprouts. \u00a0They were both \"meh\".As I said this is a solid steak house, but I wouldn't go gloating anything worldly about it. \u00a0If you have a craving for a steak then go for it. \u00a0If you are looking for a really first class meal that is above and beyond keep looking as London had better to offer.",

The service was \"interesting\". Our server let us sit for a good 1.5 hours before asking about our order. He did not approach us, he needed us to stop him when we wanted to order. A few other disappointments: It got VERY hot and VERY loud in the restaurant by the end of our Saturday night dinner. The sides were also not very good (we had the asparagus and beef dripped potatoes).",

We had cocktails in the bar before and the bartenders/waitstaff were awesome! They had perfect recommendations and were so nice.* Wine list was affordable and impressive. I'm from California and it was nice to see some Californian wines on there!* Starters: Oysters with sausages (so tasty), salmon (yummy!), bone marrow (my absolute favourite... never had such a big portion!), and scallops (they were huge, but only 1 -- would have been nice to have one more)* I shared the porterhouse with a mate and all of it was incredible. Loved the sauces too. And the method of choosing your weight on the chalkboard was fun* Triple cooked chips were amazing (we ordered a second round) and ketchup was the best I've ever had* Mushrooms and spinach weren't that impressive, but not bad by any means* Salad with apples and cheese was lovely (probably some of the best apples I've ever had too!)* We shared two desserts and both were luscious. The lemon curd with shortbread and the chocolate puddings were the best way to finish it all off.",

I ordered the set menu of the 250g ribeye and while I accept that this is one of the cheaper cuts its just wasn't up to the standards I was expecting. The meat did not have the depth of flavour I would expect it to have from good sourcing and ageing and it had quite an acrid almost burnt char. The home made ketchup did not have the right balance of vinegary and sweet and frankly Heinz is better. The side of roasted winter vegetables was just a few cheap bits of leeks, carrots and squash. The nicest bit of our meal was the cornflake sundae which was lovely but I don't think by itself would be enough to get me to return. I will be going to Goodman for my steak fix from now on.",

As with maggiebob, it's difficult for me to review the place based purely on the Qype event I attended. I mostly stayed at the bar area, as that's where all the action was at, so I didn't take a look at the dining area or kitchen. It's rather unlike the Spitalfields original in this respect. I certainly don't remember the bar having this much focus in the original. I'll agree with those who have compared it with Mad Men. I wouldn't be surprised if I walked in one fine afternoon and finding Don and Roger in a corner booth finishing up drinks! It can be a little hard to find the first time around. I was very confused by the large crowd hanging out in the alley and was worried there was a large queue to get into the restaurant before realising that they were all students hanging outside the Pineapple dance studio!",

    "text": "In my humble opinion this is probably the finest \"steakhouse\" in town. I was treated to dinner here on Saturday night, many thanks to B, and it was a wonderful experience in every respect. We kicked off our evening by grabbing a couple of stools at the bar and settled in for a cheeky cocktail. After a brief consultation with the very affable fella tending the bar I plumped for Shaky Pete's Ginger Beer while B had the Marmalade Cocktail, both from the Anti- Fogmatic section of the very extensive drinks menu. Excellent drinks, expertly made and lovingly presented, they certainly lifted the spirit and put us in the mood for the soon to come meat feast. At \u00a37.50 a throw I thought this was pretty decent value given the location. After finishing our drinks we wandered through to the main room which is a very impressive \"industrial\" type space with exposed brickwork and blackboards dotted about showing the sharing cuts of meat and the weights that are available (be warned the smaller sizes where getting crossed of pretty quick). We kicked off by ordering up some sparkling water which B thought would help with the digestion of the beast we planned on devouring later. We also had a 500 ml flask of the Torrontes Finca La Linda, Luigi Bosca 2010 from the very well put together wine list which had plenty of decent bottles at under \u00a325.00 (trust me for this kind of place in central London that's good pricing). This was a lovely fragrant floral white that went down well when paired with the oysters and the very tasty little beef sausages we shared as a starter. The main event was a 900g Porterhouse bad boy from Longhorn cattle reared in the lovely county of Yorkshire. To my mind the Porterhouse is probably the finest cut of beef and we ordered it medium rare as suggested by our lovely waitress Isabella. We paired this up with a 500ml flask of the Moulin Montarels Syrah 2008 which was nice easy drinking and went down very well. When the beast arrived it was a joy to behold, with a great looking char and vivid red flesh. The smell wafting up from serving dish was divine and I was sorely tempted to grab a chunk and eat the thing by hand. Going with the advice of Isabella we shared a portion of the Stilton Hollandaise which, as she suggested, was more than enough for two. On the side we had a portion of the beef dripping chips and also the triple cooked chips. These were pretty good but not quite the standard of chip that we had at \"Dinner\" a couple of weeks ago. However, that's a very minor quibble because the steak was fantastic and I would say it was the best I have ever had in London. If you are a fan of good steak I would recommend this place without hesitation; if you like the Gaucho chain I would definitely give Hawksmoor a try because in the steak world this is very near the top of the premier league. Somehow we still managed to squeeze a dessert in and we shared a portion of caramel ice cream and peanut butter shortbread which was very toothsome indeed. Thoroughly stuffed by this point we retired back to the bar, which was pretty heaving by now and was playing host to some very happy people. We had a couple of the Square Mile coffee martinis, a great way to get a caffeine and alcohol hit at the end of the meal, and spent a fun hour chatting and people watching. This is not a cheap night out by any means, but I think that overall you get pretty good value for your hard earned cash. You will be treated very well by the casually attired but very professional staff and any special requests you have regarding particular cuts of meat etc will be met if you let them know in advance. I'm already looking forward to going back to spend an evening in the bar and try one of the legendary Hawksmoor burgers.",

    "text": "When Hawksmoore Seven Dials opened last year, it was really a struggle just to make reservations at a decent time. I finally managed to and have been back a few times ever since. I always love a good burger and was looking forward to this one upon hearing so much about it. The first time, my friend I both ordered the Hawksmoor burger with chips at \u00a315. This is on the bar menu and not in the normal menu. It isn't a problem to request for the bar menu as I have done so many a time. The beauty of eating with a friend is the opportunity to try more stuff and it was a perfect arrangement of her ordering the triple cooked chips and me the chips with beef drippings. I also ordered my burger with Colston Bassett Stilton cheese and my friend the Ogleshield cheese. Our orders finally arrived. Apologies for the dark photos, it really was quite dark in there. The meat was utterly delicious! Juicy and bursting with flavour, you can definitely taste the difference when you get meat from a good farm and butcher. As much as I love my cheeses and don't have a problem with blue cheeses, the xxx got a bit too much for me. Maybe I'm not such a huge cheese lover after all. But if you are, you would love this. The burger with the Ogleshield cheese was easier on the palate. Creamy and melting into the meat, it was messily good. How were the chips? Crisp, crunchy and yummy. They were both good but my favourite has to be the triple fried chips. The kimchi burger on the menu has also piqued my interest and on my next return, it was kimchi burger time. I really don't know if this will actually work. I mean, kimchi is a Korean staple and is cabbage that is pickled and spicy with texture that is soggy and crunchy at the same time. When the kimchi burger arrived, you definitely know that it is kimchi. The smell is strong and hits you straightaway. To my surprise, it actually works in a strange kind of way. It may not be my favourite burger combination but I actually like this. I do applaud Hawksmoor for offering something so different and out there. There are a lot more protein options on the menu for those who don't like burgers. I should try them too the next time, if I can tear myself away from the Hawksmoor burger that is! I think the burgers and chops combo is great value and we should have more places like this which serve high quality food.",

But get past those and there's a friendly host who offers to take your coat. Not many places do that these days for free, so there's a good start! Down the steps, and as someone else mentioned, it's a throwback to urbane 1950s New York, with a dark bar thronged with people supping cocktails and generally being fabulous. There's not really any such thing as a bad cocktail, but the Hawksmoor Julip was tastily bitter, and the Concealed Weapon certainly was. The bar snacks on offer are highly recommended - the lobster roll are oozing in gorgeousness and something slightly Oriental, while the lamb cutlets were very easy on the stomach. Of course, all it did was whet the appetite, and we'll have to come back one night for the steaks in the dining room, which looked opulent, spacious, gorgeous and well-lit. Definitely somewhere you'd take Christina Hendricks on a date swoon, and far more visually impressive than its predecessor.",

Of the food that we tried, a perfectly crisp-edged and pink-middled lamb chop that just melted and a perfectly done lamb rib that just dropped off the bone were the best offerings but it was all tremendously tasty!The dining area is plush, beautifully lit and comfortable. The service was friendly and informative. A genuine hit, and one I will be visiting again soon!",

Dark wood lines the walls and floors, and tables are high recycled chemistry lab tops, lit with old Bankers' desk lamps. \u00a0The recycling bit even extends to the tiles, which are from old tube stations.BarChick felt like she should have been studying, so study the menu she did. Pete Jeary is the cocktail legend behind the menu here. He's nailed it, with all sorts of original drinks on offer: hit the Anti-Fogmatics if you're hung-over. Do NOT miss out on trying the Bloody Mary's. Pete recently won Tabasco's best Bloody Mary competition, so order some clams and he'll use the clam/bacon broth in your drink. \u00a0Now that's original.Hawksmoor probably serves the best steak in town, and you can order from the full restaurant menu in the bar. \u00a0The shorter snack menu is perfect though. BarChick loved the Kimchi burger, and everyone has to try a triple cooked chip or 3. If all this leaves you needing a pick me up then order in the Square Mile \"martinis\" - guaranteed to get you ready for a class at Pineapple Dance studios which is just around the corner!Perfect for a meat loving date, ideal for a client, and you can take BarChick there anytime!",

    "text": "Initially I thought the Hawksmoor bar looked like somewhere that should be showing American football games on giant TVs. It's all very leathery and dark, and weirdly American for somewhere that leathery and dark.I appreciated it an awful lot more on discovering these facts from the charming bar manager: - All the tiles on the bar's walls come from Tube stations- So does the flooring of lovely wooden panels (What the hell kind of Tube station is this?)- The table lights are old Bunsen burners- All the glasses and pretty silver drinks mats came from eBay and charity shops - That beautiful, huge wardrobe where you leave your coats is reclaimed as well. From where? I want an unfeasibly giant wardrobe too.- Not only do they make a beautiful, traditional Ramos Gin Fizz, but the barman added in a little nutmeg syrup to make it seasonal. How actually good is that? After filling our faces with samples from the bar menu which have been amply described by other Qypers (lamb - win, pork belly ribs - outrageous win, lobster roll - fine. But not for \u00a320), Carla_s and I decided to sit at the bar, take advantage of un-fall-out-ofable seating and give the ridiculously boozy cocktail, Zombie, a try. I've only had one before, at the Notting Hill tiki bar, Trailer Happiness, but this one was delicious, fruity and left both of us screamingly tipsy. As a jaded cocktail bore, I was seriously thrilled by Hawksmoor's menu. There is almost nothing on there that I've seen before which makes a change, and some magnificently unusual ingredients. I picked the Johnny From London purely on the basis that it's last ingredient, Bouteille Call, reminded me of learning Beyonc\u00e9's Single Ladies dancing with my WI last month \u00a0great cocktail too. I'm saving my pennies to take my carnivorous hunk of a boyfriend here soon, I can't wait to try the dining room, but really, it's all about the super-talented bar staff and working our way through the menu.",

We started our meal with a couple of beers, I was glad that we skipped appetizers, because our main plates were more than enough food. The meats were cooked just as ordered, I ordered my steak medium and my husband had his rare, i will say i have never seen a more rare steak, but apparently that's how he enjoys it.not only were we satisfied with the meats and the way they were cooked, but the fries are absolutely fabulous, they might be the best fries i've ever had. we also had a side gravy to deep our steak in, which was just the right touch.our server was very attentive and came to check on us periodically before, while and after our meal, she didn't miss a beat, a great meal with great service in a very comfortable atmosphere, I don't see why i wouldn't give the Hawksmoor five stars.",

Nestled between the two Pineapple Dance Studio locations, its quiet exterior belies an incredibly posh interior. The bar area is very well appointed, and the bar itself is without a doubt the star attraction. As a pregnant lady, I was unable to take full advantage of the amazing concoctions surrounding me, but the virgin Mojito I had was just as lovingly created as my husband's grapefruit cocktail and 'concealed weapon' creation (it smelled DIVINE, by the way). The food was also stellar, with a lovely lamb rib, what looked like very yummy oysters, and a incredibly rich stuffed lobster roll. When I am no longer pregnant, I can't wait to take out a small loan (\u00a316!) and try the 'zombie'. It looked... deliciously daunting. This is an establishment you should dress up for, and enjoy for a full evening. We can't wait for it to properly open so we can do the same.",

    "text": "Adding a review to the numerous superlative filled descriptions below seems almost pointless. However, our dinner was of such a high standard that I feel compelled to add to the sentiments expressed so far. It is, first and foremost, the best steak I have ever eaten. Rich, packed with flavour, but also perfectly cooked. We were a stag party of 13, with varying preferences, and every single steak was exactly as ordered without exception. A charred outside yielded to a pink, succulent inside and it was perfectly seasoned, not one of us reached for salt or pepper. In addition our sides and starters were similarly excellent, beef dripping chips gave me what can only be referred to as a 'mouthgasm'. My apologies now for anyone's dinner that this spoils! I should also make special mention of the service. We were in the private dining room and from beginning to end the service received was attentive and informed, but never fussy or obtrusive. In addition all the staff were lovely and blissfully unaffected by the many plaudits the restaurant has received. From the first bite to the last, our whole experience was flawless. Believe the hype, if you love steak, this place should be your Mecca.....",

Then prance on over to Bond Street and talk some of the boutique salespeople into letting you try on some hundred-thousand-pound watches--ya know, because you're an oil baron or something.

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  The new Hawksmoor, Seven Dials in Covent Garden is a shiny, brassy counterpart to its more pared back Shoreditch mothership. Located in the old Watney-Combe brewery, the front bar is dark, stylish and sophisticated. This is essentially a steak house (and a mighty fine one - I'll get to that later). But in the domain of proven bar man extraordinaire, Shaky Pete (who has moved over from the Shoreditch branch), we sip well made marmalade cocktails in martini glasses (\u00a37.50) and some excellent lagers while making the most of Hawksmoor's superb bar menu. I've sung the praises of the extraordinary Hawksmoor burger before, its juicy, loosely packed meat laden with fatty marrow to give it extra richness. Rob orders it here and gives it the thumbs up - it looks every bit as good as those I've had at Shoreditch. Now, there's also a choice of the Burger Van Burger (a stripped down version of the classic Hawksmoor burger) or the Kimchi burger. For something different, I go for the latter and it's certainly an eyeful. The meat is fantastic (no surprise there), and it's huge. However, I'm not a massive fan of the kimchi (a Korean dish of fermented cabbage and spices). Rich and tangy, it's nice enough on its own - but I find it quite overpowering with the burger. If I'd never met the original Hawksmoor burger, I would be writing home about this one now - it's good. But we've met, I'm smitten and so it's the original burger all the way for me. The burgers come with a choice of thick, crunchy beef dripping chips (my choice - they're fantastic), triple cooked chips (both sorts of chips come with a gorgeous Stilton hollandaise) or a refreshing green salad. The latter may not sound as sexy but is terrific as far as greenery goes. (Burger and chips/salad is \u00a315 - but, oh, it's worth it). TPG's lobster roll is a fine thing - generous pieces of sweet lobster are heaped into a long, warm, toasted brioche bun with garlic, hazelnut butter and mayo. Apparently, it's stuffed with a whole Dorset Blue. Strangely, there's a side of bearnaise which is excellent in its own right but I'm not sure what it's doing there with a lobster roll. The clincher is this baby is quite small for \u00a325 and doesn't come with the side of chips or salad. In New York this week, I ate the lobster roll of my life (at Luke's Lobster, East Village), made with huge chunks of fresh lobster from a sustainable source in Maine - it cost me $14 (\u00a38.73, review to follow). It may not be fair to make direct comparisons of two such different operations in entirely different continents, but it has to be said that the Hawksmoor lobster roll is hair raisingly expensive. But that's pretty much where my quibbles with anything about the Hawksmoor end. I also ate in the larger dining room during the soft opening period. Exposed brickwork and dark pillars give an industrial edge to the sleek room, which is perfectly conducive to the task at hand - consuming large quantities of tremendously good steak. All steaks are from Yorkshire Longhorns reared by The Ginger Pig and dry aged for at least 35 days. My preferred cut is the fatty bone-in prime rib (\u00a36/100g), although they're out of that and the rib eye (400g, \u00a325) by the time we order on the first night of the popular soft opening period. Our lovely waiter arranges for us to have a large chateaubriand for the same price (normally \u00a312/100g). It's quite easily the tastiest chateaubriand I can remember, the dry ageing giving a great depth of meaty flavour. It's gorgeously tender and cooked to perfection on the Josper charcoal grill. There's a satisfying charred crust while the middle is lusciously pink and juicy. The delectable bone marrow gravy is our sauce of choice and we don't regret it. We share the excellent, crisp and fluffy beef dripping chips and a serve of creamed spinach (\u00a34 each). TPG is tempted by the macaroni cheese, but we save it for next time. And now I have an admission to make. Before our ginormous steak, we also ate a serve of lamb chops. And it certainly taught me a lesson - just because you're out for steak, do NOT ignore the chops. They're grilled with a mint and caper salad which adds salty, zingy flavours to the deep, juicy meat (\u00a310). Sublime. We also enjoyed the excellent prawn cocktail (\u00a38.50). In the end, it's really hard to choose between dishes - so much appeals. The mini sticky toffee sundae (\u00a34) is delicious with gloopy bits in the sauce at the bottom, although TPG's custard tart is a little bland (\u00a36) - we regret not opting for the sticky toffee pudding which comes highly recommended. Your bill at the Hawksmoor will stack up - it's not cheap. Dinner for 2 with drinks is likely to cost around \u00a3100 (plus service). However, it's a joyous place to indulge in great quality meat with some classy cocktails on the side. If you haven't been already, add it to",

    "text": "Hawksmoor have outdone themselves here with what is, quite frankly, one of the best bars-cum-restaurants I've visited in London full stop. The branch near Liverpool Street is great in nearly every sense, but the decor did feel basic bordering on the austere. The Covent Garden branch, however, is perfect in every sense of the word. Mad Men is the description that most immediately springs to mind - it has a laid-back glamour from a previous age. One feels remiss for not turning up in a sharp suit, before relaxing with a whiskey and cigar. Or a proper man's cocktail. And boy does Hawksmoor do these well. I've been to far too many average cocktail bars where the principal is the sweeter the better. Hawksmoor's bar offers the best cocktails I've had in London so far. And I've had a lot of cocktails. The flavours are perfectly balanced, with the two rum-based drinks I ordered mixed perfectly and offering a bitter, almost herby-flavour drink; the kind you can imagine Hemmingway sipping. Of course, Hawksmoor is nothing without the food. We didn't have the steak, but if it's as good as the original branch, then it'll be one of the best steaks in London. The assorted lamb cutlets and ribs, though, were melt-in-the-mouth tender and delicious in every sense of the word. The lobster sandwich, though, was perfection between two slices of bread. I wouldn't often plump for lobster over a good cut of meat but this sandwich has won me over totally. Hawksmoor isn't cheap, but then you'd expect nothing else. But with food this good, and that rare thing of a restaurant bar I'd happily drink in without eating, with a stunning array of drinks, it's worth every penny. Eat, indulge and let your inner Don Draper out.",

The Mac n Cheese was a bit better, albeit with a little helping of salt and pepper. \u00a0Both our salads were disappointing, I'd pass on the traditional tomato salad and classic Caeser; they tasted like they were made by a someone following a recipe book for the first time and definitely absent of any locavore mindset.My cocktail selection was superb, I had the Manhattan for two (for one) and both the presentation and quality were wonderful. \u00a0The drink was served premixed in a chilled glass flask with old fashioned glasses, rock cubes, a slither of orange peel, and maraschino cherries on the side so you can pour your own from the staple elements. \u00a0I loved the experience and the flavor of the classic cocktail itself.Service was quite good, our server was polished and attentive in his approach. \u00a0My wife's second drink took a long time but otherwise, everything was on point.

In San Francisco, I can put together a full-on epic tasting menu from the sides' section of the menu.I expected no less from this well-rated steakhouse.Hold up. Slow down. Don't get excited. Not what happened.....I ordered the heritage tomato salad. The tomatoes didn't taste fresh, the onions and vinaigrette that accompanied it? Boring and bland.For my entree I ordered the macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach. The mac was decent after I baptized it in salt and pepper. The creamed spinach couldn't be fixed. The chips I shared with my husband were good, although the English ketchup was meh and too vinegary.The two wines I ordered, Malbec and Cabernet, were no good:( So, I settled for a vodka soda. \u00a0Two stars at best.I was left wishing din had been better...Until I had the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. Broke my taste buds.Wow! I'd only had something similar in Ireland.The pudding was in fact a sticky, buttery, toffee-dominated, fluffy yet creamy wonderful mess of a pudding. It was topped off with the smoothest tasting vanilla ice cream I've ever had. The night redeemed itself. I could've had ten of these! That dessert bumped this spot up to three stars!I'd go back for the dessert.",

The first time I tried it was booked but then I tried again and was successful.The restaurant is near Covent Garden. We arrived early and browsed in the vendor stalls before making our way to the restaurant. We were a few minutes early but seated immediately.Our server, Ruben, provided exceptional service, making recommendations and answering all of our questions.We both had the Sunday roast meal with drinks. The roast was delicious and accompanied by lots of vegetables. Plenty of food. We also enjoyed our desserts. I had the sticky toffee sundae and it was a perfect way to end the meal along with a nice port.We sat near the bar so it was a bit loud but not too distracting.Definitely recommend for Sunday roast.",

Food, drinks, service, atmosphere - you name it, they smashed it.The journey to 5-star-ville began right from the charming front of house staff waiting behind the heavy wooden front door. They smiled respectfully rather than laughing in my face when I managed to forget that it was I who'd made the booking. Awkward silence over and bags safely stowed in their rather impressive giant wardrobe, we were led downstairs to the busy bar to wait for our 4th member.We pulled up 3 high chairs at the bar counter and the barman proceeded to make (the first part of) my night. Having perused the gorgeous cocktail menu for a while I was still stuck so asked for some advice of the whisky cocktail variety. The barman was sweet, he listened to what I liked, and he knew what he was talking about (the accent didn't hurt either). Though he then almost lost me by giving me a swig of their butter-infused bourbon to try - v generous but I could practically feel the clarified butter clogging my arteries. He didn't give up though, and after I made a much happier face at tasting a rye whiskey, he used it to make me a variation on a Manhattan (a Made Man). Full marks at the bar then :)Once our 4th member arrived there was a short delay before we were ushered through to the restaurant area, which had a lovely welcoming glow to it like someone had put a valencia filter on the room, and was humming with what sounded like happy eaters. We soon joined them - I shared a 750g chateaubriand with my steak buddy which worked out well as he could eat two-thirds and myself a third without wasting any. Nicely satisfying to see them cross it off the nearby chalkboard after we'd ordered it too - the larger cuts all depend on what they've got in stock. It was cooked to medium rare pink perfection, and with every delicious bite I finally understood all the people I'd heard raving about how the Hawksmoor guys know how to handle their meat. The other two had individual cuts which also looked beautiful, all teamed with some tasty sides (thumbs up for the triple cooked chips, though the creamed spinach is verry creamy) and a lush bottle of red. We somehow found room to share a couple of desserts afterwards too, with the sticky toffee pudding winning out over the choc and salted caramel tart.Service was smooth and attentive, and added a final touch of class to an all-round fabulous evening. The bill when it came was about \u00a385 per head all in, including cocktails, wine and service, with our chateaubriand obv being the priciest item at around \u00a395. So it's one for a special occasion/treat rather than an average dinner (sadly!), but I have to say, I've never more strongly felt that a meal in this price bracket was as worth it as this one. Probably biased by the fact that it had (almost) all my favourite things! Better start saving up a Hawksmoor fund for my next visit...",

We started looking for another place to eat, when the hostess called and said that the kitchen will wait for us! We were stoked! We walked in, and the place had a great vibe. The servers had recommended a number of things. I have had bone marrow all over the U.S. and have never had bone marrow as rich as they have them here. The steak was also nice and tender, and the peanut butter brittle for dessert is to die for.",

The steaks are flawless, the bone marrow starter is... even thinking about it makes my mouth water, and the sticky toffee pudding is beyond belief. As if that weren't enough, the cocktail menu is incredible. I really recommend talking to the staff as to which drink goes well with your order, but do be aware that if you have one per course, for three courses, you won't leave in a straight line. The staff are super friendly, very knowledgable about their trade, and (here's the killer), will leave you alone while you're soaking in the warmly intimate, subterranean, atmosphere (and drooling slightly), but appear immediately from the glowing woodwork if you need them. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and not one detail has gone astray. I like their deft touch so much, I went looking for the -hand soap- they use in their bathrooms. I'd suggest a slightly later dinner on a week night, rather than an early one on a weekend, purely to fully appreciate the feel of the place. Finally, a brief honourable mention to my local branch in Spitalfields: Their Sunday roast is very very good, won't completely eviscerate your wallet, and is best enjoyed with a bottle of red between two to four. You will need to book ahead, and the atmosphere is a bit more bustling, but the food is no less amazing.",

Then discovered they were in a nearby pub having been told to come back in an hour. Table wasn't ready when we got back but suddenly appeared somehow \u00a0- because, as I later found out, my intimidating barrister friend had some stern words with a member of staff!Anyway this is all irrelevant because the Christmas Burger was the best burger I have ever had. It didn't even have beef in it. It featured buttermilk turkey, sausage patty, cranberry, cheese and god knows what else. It came served with roast potatoes and gravy. It was incredible. It says a lot for it that the other burger we tried, their classic version, was completely overshadowed even though it was probably the second best burger I've ever had. SO GOOD. And, at \u00a315, incredibly reasonable for such great quality food (and a massive portion).",

    "text": "Hidden in the corner of Langley Street, Hawksmoor Seven Dials is definitely a place for meat-lovers / carnivores. It lived up its reputation, by taste and price (not a budget experience, but worth it).We had 900g (you read that right) Bone-in Prime Rib, medium, to share between the 2 of us. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned (we avoid the sauces as it just tastes so good without them already) and each bite was a joy. For me, this may be too much meat in one go, but for a guy to share, this is as good as it gets. We had the mac and cheese on the side - one of my favourites, and we had purple sprouting broccoli, definitely needed some sides to counterbalance all the meat we were consuming.As full as I was already, there is always another stomach for desserts. I had the sticky toffee pudding and that was no disappointment. The pudding was like a warm lava cake, moist but not too dense, surrounded by sticky toffee (that got a bit too sweet at the end). It was a perfect match with the cold smooth vanilla (ice) cream. It was absolutely heavenly. If you're not impressed by the meat, you'd be impressed with this dessert. (On the side, lemon meringue pie was tangy, but had too much cream which was not the best option to end the night off).This place was almost perfect, though lost one star as I felt rushed by the waitress in the beginning to order my drinks, and the food off the menu. Mind you, she gave great suggestions, but I did not like the feeling of being rushed when I just got seated, while trying to take in the ambience/decor of the place and read the full menu before deciding what to order. Thankfully, no rushing vibe during the dinner itself when the food came.",

I have tried a fair few steaks in my life and this had to be the best so far. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and perfectly seasoned. Along with the beef dripping chips it was simply heaven on a plate. It is making my mouth water just at the thought of it. To end was a sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream. I am not a dessert person but this was simply amazing. We were of to see a show and decided not the express menu. For \u00a327 for three courses I wasn't expecting much for the money but we all left full so satisfied with everything. The service was perfect.

You'll find all the major cuts on offer here, as well as an impressive list of special steaks meant to be shared among two or more people. I've now been to this particular Hawksmoor three times, and I've never been disappointed. I've had the Chateaubriand, Porterhouse, and fillet, and all of them have been amazing. The sides and desserts are equally delicious, so try some mac and cheese, triple cooked chips, creamed spinach, caesar salad, or really anything - you won't be disappointed and will most likely need to be rolled out of the restaurant! My favourite way to finish off the evening is with some sticky toffee pudding, and the Hawksmoor's is particularly amazing.One important note - I normally ask for my steaks to be cooked Medium-Rare, but here I go with Medium. I don't know why, but their ratings seem a bit skewed to me, so a Medium will come out with plenty of pink in the middle (almost rare even), so take that into account and make sure you talk to the server about how you want your steak cooked.",

Server was knowledgeable and fun without being too in your face. Starters were delicious, desserts fantastic but the main was amazing. We shared a large rib on the bone and the meat was tasty and perfectly cooked. Sides were also sensational - amazing chips, sauces, salads and veg. Slightly strange that your premium large steak comes pre-sliced in a skillet. \u00a0A bit disappointing that you don't get to fully appreciate your steak before its dissected for you!If you are near a Hawksmoor call in a give it a go. If you don't want the full on a la carte experience an \"Express\" fixed price menu is also available limited times.",

    "text": "Meat lovers....this is your home! Visited Hawksmoor after reading loads of positive reviews from fellow yelpers. I must say that it was well worth paying extra money for good quality meat. They offer various cuts of meat to suit your palate. The size is also variable based on how much you can consume. The server we had was very knowledgeable and attentive in giving us recommendation based on what we want. As for the ambiance, casual and classy but not snobby. If you enjoy the feel of British rustic decor, you will love Hawskmoor. In addition, I love the idea that this restaurant is located underground. It is literally below the buzzling streets of Covent Garden. Yes space is a problem in London but not so much here in Hawksmoor! Definitely spacious and airy here compared to the usual cramp and narrow British restaurants considering it is below the ground. Checkout.",

But everyone I know does so I have had 3 dishes that are meant for non red meat eaters and they've ranged from dry and boring to bland and tasteless. Lobster? As I said before, grilled and therefore completely dry. Why not steam it so it retains it flavors and juices?Chicken? I did the Sunday Roast and since I don't eat red meat was given a half roast chicken instead. Yeah, it was alright. Plain and rubbery but alright.Fish? The menu said it was wrapped and cooked with chili and rosemary - but I'm quite sensitive to spice and I tasted nothing. Just plain flavourless fish. The plain chicken had more flavour, and everyone knows plain chicken doesn't have a lot of that. If you're a meat eater this place is great. If not, the best thing to do is come here and make a meal out of cocktails and sides. I recommend the carrots.",

You're going to get better food here so it's worth the extra \u00a3). Drinks are also fab, both cocktails and the non-alcoholic. \u00a0Staff are wonderful - our waiter was amazing and recommended his fav dessert (sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel ice cream), and OMG... this is the type of dessert that'll have you making bedroom noises and have the people at the next table looking over. Mildly embarrassing, but you won't care once you've tasted this. Make sure you make a reservation if you're going to visit!",

My cousin and I chose the roast because really, what else were we going to choose? Apart from the intimidatingly large spinach leaves I polished everything off. The beef was as you'd expect from a restaurant prized for its meat - delicious. And a special shout out to the potatoes and Yorkshire pud. The welcome twist for me was a roasted half bulb of garlic which I smothered on everything (making a note to myself to pick up strong chewing gum on the way home).I also had a try of my sister's macaroni cheese. It's gone all trendy these days but was so glad to have the homely classic in front of me, done to perfection.",

When entering you feel that you've just joined a secret club of steak eaters - you can tell it's a nice place, but it isn't overly posh or pompous. The menus are simple and straightforward: steak and stuff that goes with steak. Starters are mainly sea-food based, but we decided to go straight into business. We decided to go with a special cut of Porterhouse and share it between us, alongside a nice bottle of red wine and a few sides.And yes. Best. Steak. Ever. Okay, we did pay \u00a372 for it (\u00a39/100g - you chose your cut/size when ordering) - but totally worth it.The service was impeccable - friendly, helpful, and knew what they were talking about - but without that forced over-serviced attitude that I really hate.So yup - that's this place added to my \"favourite places in London\" list.",

We made reservations for 830 but arrived a bit late since it took us some time to find the place, although concerned they would give our reservations away once we arrived we had no problems being seated there was no need to rush as the restaurant was not crowded maybe they do give away reservations when the place is busy good for us this wasn't the case. Drinks we started with some House wine Red for me, Whiskey & soda for my friends drinks were good. Steak I had the Sirloin cooked medium rare along with a some Garlic butter & for a side I had the Mac & Cheese. Steak was amazing perfectly cooked juicy piece of meat the garlic butter was a great added touch simply because I love garlic butter. Mac & cheese was very good as well good taste, since I had my garlic butter did add some to the Mac , good call everything taste better with garlic butter. Friends had the Rib eye & another Sirloin both cooked well with Mash potato. Rib eye was very good nice taste. One of my friends had The Roasted chicken this was good the outside had a nice taste but a bit dry on the inside not too bad my friend had this with mash potato, good mash potatoes I added some of the garlic butter & yumm so good. There was little room left but one of us manage to try the Raspberry ice cream, wow ice was very tasty. As for the place itself nice restaurant pretty big with a bar area in the front when you first walk in, service was good & prices I say are expensive. Everything we had was delicious although it can be pricey it's really worth a try.",

Definitely an A++ on the drinks and hospitality on the bartender's part. He also recommended some spots to us for late night drinks. I wish I could remember the bartenders name!! The dinner was solid. It was fast service and we really enjoyed the scallop starter. The steaks weren't the best steaks we have ever had but still a solid Saturday night dinner.

We walked in without a reservation, the dining room was booked, but they offered us bar area seating. The ambiance was typical bar, lively and informal, the waiter was playful and very attentive. We ordered a 650 gram T-bone for me and a 300 gram Fillet. For sides we ordered butter greens, macaroni and cheese, and creamed spinach. Everything arrived at the same time, hot and well presented, for a Steakhouse. Which is to say, the sides arrived in their own small cast iron dishes and the steaks on a white plate. The steaks had a nice char to them and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. The first bite revealed a juicy morsel, well seasoned and that nutty-beefy flavor that only comes with dry-aging. The sides were all good, though the creamed spinach was a real standout. It was a great dinner and well worth the price.

The fries here are cooked the same way. \u00a0It was nice revisiting my childhood. \u00a0The funniest part of the evening was that the homemade ketchup of which they showed great pride and is for the fries, not the steak, was so cold it would not come out of the bottle.",

    "text": "I've been giving out a lot of 5 stars lately, and I almost wish I could take a few back from other reviews to REALLY MAKE THIS ONE STAND OUT.Because Hawksmoor Seven Dials? Truly a stand-out experience. UnmiSTEAKably (see? Eh? Bad joke? Don't leave! Keep reading!).So, we had some celebrating to do, and also my adorable Mom is concerned about my iron levels (both true stories). Celebrating with steak, then? NAILED IT. Hawksmoor has several locations around London, but I'm a fan of Seven Dials tucked away from Covent Garden. It's a little tricky to find, but a cavernous space...it's just underground. Effect: it's a time vacuum. A literal time vacuum. You're down in a basement of a steakhouse surrounded by beautiful banquettes and dark lighting and it could be 7pm. Or 1am. Or 2016. Or 2027. Sometimes meaty time-travel is a treat, yeah?So I'm going to chirp about the Express Menu which is a great deal. It's offered at all locations, though sometimes the menu varies *slightly*, as does the time during which it's available (generally: lunch, and the either pre-dinner or post-dinner rush). For 25GBP it's 2 courses; 28GBP for three.My go-to for the starter is bone marrow. Hawksmoor does this expertly; two Fred Flintstone-style bones presented topped with caramelized onions and sprinklings of salt. Some grilled bread on the side makes it a perfect opening for, well...as Rob H. describes...the meat sweats.Rump and fillet tail are both on the Express Menu (the latter with a 5GBP supplement), which comes with a choice of side. I can confess: I've never deviated from triple cooked chips. I mean, *you* can, but I'm not gonna.I am obsessed with the anchovy hollandaise and their house-made ketchup. If you're a fan of condiments you will like this spot (hot English mustard also available). UMAMI LIKE WHOAH.I should have led with this earlier, but the boozy selection at Hawksmoor is not an afterthought. Fine selection of wines, and great cocktail list. The marmalade cocktail is citrusy and bitter but also sweet and - sole complaint - too small! Classics like negronis and whiskey sours are done perfectly. And the icing on the steak (gah; flawed visual?) is: the service at Hawksmoor. It reminds me of the best of American service, which I hope is taken as a compliment in the spirit in which it was intended: unpretentious, attentive, not overbearing. Never, ever rushed. Everyone is warm, and smiley, and open. An umbrella is remembered. A celebratory drink is comped. It's these little things that are BIG things and keep me a devoted Hawksmoor fan. Yelp note: yes, a steakhouse, but I appreciate their efforts to diversify with some vegetarian options - a fresh burrata and asparagus salad! Ricotta dumplings! - as well as some seafood and grilled chicken options. I can't promise I will try any of those offerings when I find myself in a Hawksmoor, but it's nice to know they exist. Viva la difference! (see also: MORE STEAK FOR ME)",

As for the atmosphere - it is classy enough for dinner dates (dimly lit with table candles), but casual enough to just enjoy a meal (no dress code and friendly informal service), or even only a drink in the bar area. The place is not cheap, but compared to other places which serve quality meat on this level around the world , it's actually not expensive either, but fairly priced.",

Top that with bone marrow gravy and you have yourself heaven on a plate. We split the sticky toffee pudding which was beyond delicious. I wish there was a Hawksmoor in Charlotte, NC!!!!",

If that's the case - English beef needs an overhaul. The Good News - great service and wonderful wine list. Great atmosphere and attentive bar staff. But nothing - and I mean nothing - can overcome the dynamic duo of bad beef and uninspired cooking. Nothing that spring from the kitchen seemed to be cooked .... imagine that .... not the scallops, the beef, not even the Yorkshires. Everything was underdone. And there is nothing that can point out just bad a cut of beef is than to have it served at a lower temperature. Ordered Medium, our steaks were bloody. Sent back - they weren't any better. At that point we just ate them to find he cut of the filet was dreadful. For the price I expected wonderful. Complaints were made. Chocolates were given. A massive bill was still delivered. I felt like a mark at a carnival. Skip it .... this place is the Emperors New Clothes. A bunch of young people and supposed foodies who think they know their cow but are more impressed to just get a table and be served a mediocre pile of uninspired blah.",

However, the roast beef served here is medium rare and tender. \u00a0I would just make sure to sprinkle it with some freshly ground salt & pepper at the table because it seems they may have forgotten to season it in the kitchen.",

The wine was really nice, shame the waiter didn't know it had to be served at room temperature and opened before so it can \"breathe\" (even though we had to wait for it for 40 minutes)The worst part of the experience was, with no doubt, the waiter. No knowledge of the food and wine served there and for the price, i think he should also know where to put the cutlery on the table and how to pour wine in a glass. On the more positive note, the cocktail menu seemed a lot more attractive and thought for.",

However I found the sirloin much tastier than the cut from the Sunday roast. I will go for sirloin or ribeye next time for sure.The place is classy with quirky rustic features, with a big 'Beef and Liberty' sign near the entrance, nice wooden tables and leather chairs, dim lighting, brick wall, it really puts you in the mood for large quantity of meat. The service is nothing but delightful. Will recommend it to all fellow carnivores.",

Amongst the fray, some kind of spicy horseradish type mayo that added kick and a little je-ne-sais quoi.The gravy drip chips were king; the triple fried had an excellent crunch, but were a little unremarkable in taste but in no way bad.. but seriously, get the gravy chips. All this served with my favorite London brew, the Meantime Pale Ale, which seems eternally sold out at my locale waitrose.. maybe Hawksmoor has first dips. \u00a0Sadly, I have yet to sample their bread and butter, by that I mean their steak, but considering how I enjoyed the burgers, it's a situation I plan to remedy in the future. \u00a0But mind the price, it ain't cheap.",

    "text": "The bar is stunning--grand wood paneling, retro leather stools, solid wood tables and an elegant bar give the place a feeling of gravitas. There are a few quirky finishing touches that give the place a real personality and charm. For instance, they have collected loads of different, but beautiful glasses so each time you order a cocktail, part of the fun is finding out what glass it will be served in.The cocktail menu has been carefully crafted and even things that sound a bit odd are absolutely delicious. Highlights include the Manhattan for two people which is served in a bottle and comes with ice and garnish so you can create the drink to your liking. Other must tastes include the Silver Bullet which vaguely reminds me of rye bread (but don't let that put you off, it's fab) and the Concealed Weapon which has a base of Absinthe but ultimately has a complex flavour profile. If you're anything like me, you'll go with a bunch of friends and steadily work your way through the entire cocktail list. It's worth doing at Hawksmoor. And if you get stuck and can't decide what to order the head bartender is brilliant; he'll ask a few questions and then suggest something undoubtably amazing. He's also great at pairing cocktails with food so if you order dinner or even just dessert, definitely get a recommendation for the accompanying cocktails. I've been going on for ages about the booze, but the food is just as good. The triple cooked chips are a must even if you're just in for drinks. The steaks are cooked to perfection and I highly recommend the kimchi burger. You can't go wrong with this spot... so you'll probably walk out with an empty wallet.",

    "text": "The Sunday roast sounds like the thing to get, but unfortunately i wasn't there on a Sunday. \u00a0So what does that leave us for the rest of the week? My review is based on only one visit, and from eating the rib eye steak. I've read a few comments saying \"this is the best steakhouse in London\" and based on my humble New York Steakhouse learned sense of culinary judgement, i strongly disagree. \u00a0Rib eye is one of the most basic forms of steak, and is usually one of the most flavorful (read fatty). It's hard to screw up. \u00a0But I can honestly say the rib eye i consumed here was absolutely pedestrian rivaling any inexpensive family restaurant, and was certainly not competitive to any establishment of this caliber or price point. \u00a0While cooked to my liking, the temperature was too lukewarm having sat a bit too long. \u00a0The flavor was nothing spectacular and i'm sorry to say I've had better tasting meat served in business class of commercial airliners. \u00a0My steak at Hawksmoor was the most disappointing meal i had during my last visit to London, perhaps maybe because of my elevated expectations, and that's a shame because the ambiance and the rest of the menu were fun and worth another try. \u00a0I will be back, but i will not have the rib eye. \u00a0The smoked salmon appetizer was decent though again, i've certainly had much better during the same UK trip. \u00a0The side dish of creamed spinach was good, not overly salty like many places with a clean not too fatty aftertaste. \u00a0Dessert was a chocolate caramel tart with popcorn ice cream, a fun and rich dish which demonstrated what this place could do when it got things right. \u00a0So i will chalk this mediocre review to me ordering the wrong thing from the menu. \u00a0But i'd argue that at these prices, pretty much everything should be spot on.",

The first time I put it down to the cut I chose (too lean and therefore no real flavour) and the 2nd time the meat arrived no warmer than tepid. Might try it one more time, (third times a charm) but if the steak isn't good then I'll have to stick to Goodman. I also don't like the (too) casual attire of the staff.... I know... casual is the new black but some of the things they wear... I wouldn't wear at home. Let alone in a place where I'm paying \u00a330-40 for a steak.",

By all accounts the burgers were amazing - I managed to snaffle a few of the triple cooked chips which were excellent, although we all agreed that however hard people try to make their own ketchup, it's never quite as good as Heinz. Back to the veggie dish (for there was only one) - and I think they got their menu ideas from another meat-fest place, Hereford Road, as it was remarkably similar: a pearl barley risotto with various vegetables chucked in. Perfectly nice, although slightly underseasoned, so I asked for extra cheese to perk it up - and there were some oddly placed large chunks of beetroot sort of lurking on the side.Anyway - the puddings. I confess to being slightly disappointed that I couldn't try the apparently fabulous sticky toffee pudding as they now put rum in the sauce, and I can't have alcohol. I was very tempted by the peanut butter shortbread, as I tried a minature version earlier this year at some food awards - but I can never resist a decent summer pudding, so I went for that. It was gratifyingly large, in a lake of deep cerise juice - fresh and delicious. Meatless Monday? Not half bad, even at Hawksmoor.",

Considering this meal cost over \u00a3200 for two people I expected quite a lot, and they failed to deliver at every turn. We sat at our table for ages waiting for someone to come clear our plates and had at least 5 different wait staff members come by, and often they didn't know what the other one was doing or what we'd asked for.

The ambiance is great and the steaks are pretty straightforward- you just order a cut of meat and it comes with no frills, but cooked perfectly (I ordered mine rare and was very satisfied with the result). Out of the sides, my party had six of them, out of which I most enjoyed the macaroni cheese and the chips. Don't waste your time on the tomato salad or the buttered spring greens... really bland compared to the rest of the food. We also got the bone marrow, which was really just fat scraped off a bone... take that as you will. I've heard the Sunday roast here is amazing, but that you should pre-order to make sure they don't run out of what you want. The 5 pound BYO on Monday sounds great too! Or the set menu that's pre-6:30 or after 10 PM Monday through Saturday. So many ways to enjoy an awesome place!",

We started with cocktails in the bar where I realized instantly that I quite enjoyed the contrast between the classy drinks and high end menu with the more casually dressed staff and the exposed brick/piping environment.We were seated right on time where our wines had already been opened and decanted nicely and then proceeded to order an unecessary amount of food. We all loved the bone marrow and slow-cooked onion starter (I was unsure about that on name alone, but it was fantastic) and the ribs were nice as was the lentil salad in our fake attempt to get something lighter into the meal.I ordered the kimchi burger with triple-cooked chips as my main because I had never had it before and it was a really nice burger and a nice change from the usual. The chips and homemade ketchup were fantastic. I also participated in the two massive 900g steaks my three friends ordered between the two of them. The bone-in ribeye was absolutely phenomenal and worth the trip on its own. We also got sides of spinach, mushrooms, and more chips. And then for some reason felt the need to order desserts, which were fine, but the stars were the main dishes.I ate so much I wanted to explode, but it was entirely worth it and they let us sit at our table and savor our ridiculously long and large meal. Forget the debates between where in the world has the best meat, just go here and enjoy it. **Updated follow a visit to the one in Spitalfields (apparently they have MUCH more stringent standards for serving bar food in the restaurant harumph) and Air Street (lively environment, awful service)",

Now, all of my Brittish companions, please do forgive me about talking about budget, prices, etc. I know that is not considered proper ettiquete here, but in America not that many people care about those things, and I want to express my whole experience so you get the total picture.The menu has a very deceptive express meal on the front of the restaurant and on the website for a two course including ribeye and sides for 20 pounds that had me still well within budget for two with extras to purchase. What they don't tell you is that it ends at 6:30pm, and our reservation was at seven. So after we got in and set down and heard the news, we had to scratch that one off. We both didn't really feel like getting up and walking out for the disinformation, how embarracing would that be?We ended up ordering one of the larger steaks that they recommend to share between two people. The steak (Chateaubriand) was supposed to be the premium cut, and according to the waitress was supposed to melt in your mouth, even better than their filet. It ended costing 72 pounds. Now folks, if you pay 72 pounds (equivelant to about $120) in the US for a steak, it will literally melt in your mounth. This one however I couldn't even finish. It was tough, grizzely, and had me wiping pieces of it in my napkin from my mouth because I couldn't swallow it. The flavor was as flat as a b minor.Giles Coren, you are so wrong about this being the best steak you'll ever eat. If this is the best steak I'll ever eat, red meat is off my list for good. Esquire magazine, I hope for your sake you do find a resaurant with better steak than this rubbish.The creamed spinach tasted like it came out of a can and the mashed potatoes and gravy were nothing exceptional either. I am very, very, very disappointed in this place. Our one night out after two weeks. Hawksmoor management, if you are going to charge top dollar for a steak, it better be of the highest quality, texture, and taste. You have disgraced yourselves. I have had better steak at a cheap family restaurant in the states, that cost the equivelant of about 5 pounds.Hawksmoor, please enjoy the value you stole from us tonight. We did not recieve anything even close to what we paid for. If it was possible to rate no stars I would but I have to give one star for okay atmosphere and friendly staff, like that of a real estate office, or car dealership if you will.charmed.",

Hawksmoor definitely has the best Sunday Roast of all the places I've tried in London. It was my favorite place to take my London guests.

They also have THE BEST sticky toffee pudding (one of my ultimate food obsessions whilst in London) A must-try!

    "text": "When Hawksmoore Seven Dials opened last year, it was really a struggle just to make reservations at a decent time. I finally managed to and have been back a few times ever since. I always love a good burger and was looking forward to this one upon hearing so much about it. The first time, my friend I both ordered the Hawksmoor burger with chips at \u00a315. This is on the bar menu and not in the normal menu. It isn't a problem to request for the bar menu as I have done so many a time. The beauty of eating with a friend is the opportunity to try more stuff and it was a perfect arrangement of her ordering the triple cooked chips and me the chips with beef drippings. I also ordered my burger with Colston Bassett Stilton cheese and my friend the Ogleshield cheese. Our orders finally arrived. Apologies for the dark photos, it really was quite dark in there. The meat was utterly delicious! Juicy and bursting with flavour, you can definitely taste the difference when you get meat from a good farm and butcher. As much as I love my cheeses and don't have a problem with blue cheeses, the xxx got a bit too much for me. Maybe I'm not such a huge cheese lover after all. But if you are, you would love this. The burger with the Ogleshield cheese was easier on the palate. Creamy and melting into the meat, it was messily good. How were the chips? Crisp, crunchy and yummy. They were both good but my favourite has to be the triple fried chips. The kimchi burger on the menu has also piqued my interest and on my next return, it was kimchi burger time. I really don't know if this will actually work. I mean, kimchi is a Korean staple and is cabbage that is pickled and spicy with texture that is soggy and crunchy at the same time. When the kimchi burger arrived, you definitely know that it is kimchi. The smell is strong and hits you straightaway. To my surprise, it actually works in a strange kind of way. It may not be my favourite burger combination but I actually like this. I do applaud Hawksmoor for offering something so different and out there.There are a lot more protein options on the menu for those who don't like burgers. I should try them too the next time, if I can tear myself away from the Hawksmoor burger that is!I think the burgers and chops combo is great value and we should have more places like this which serve high quality food.",

Waited patiently with husband for steak, he had 400g rib eye, I had 300g fillet. Paul selected anchovie-hollandaise; I chose the Bernaise. The anchovie sauce was delic (the Bernaise delicious also but variety...it is the spice of life). Triple cooked fries, em yes please. Buttered greens, I still don't know what the greens were, husband also \"no idea\", but they were green and crunchy, and delicious. My steak, requested medium; it arrived medium-rare. It was fabulous. I will ask for medium rare in the future. This chef knows what his doing. Go here. Eat here. Be satisfied.",

    "text": "I'd been excited about our reservation at this new Hawksmoor for some time, and it didn't disappoint.Not the friendliest of welcomes on our arrival - seeing noone behind the desk I assumed they were downstairs seating customers and we waited for their return. I then managed to completely ignore the host's welcome and initial questions as I had no idea she was a member of staff in this slightly busy reception area. In fact, my only gripe about the place is that you can't tell who works here and who doesn't! The staff seemingly wear what they like and in a busy place like this, working out who is your waiter and who is just popping to the toilets isn't the easiest of tasks. Not a big gripe though.We were seated in the large dining room. The wood and metal theme lends the place a sense of industrial luxury. The table and the chairs were impressive and very comfortable.Apart from maybe 3 cuts on the menu, their steaks come in large sizes; designed to share. Not what I'm used to, but it made for a more social and interesting dining experience. I shared the 1Kg Porterhouse with a friend and it ws fantastic. Cooked to perfection with a chargrill taste on the outside and the meat so very tender and juicy inside. Perfect. The sides we opted for were frankly delicious. We can certainly vouch for the mushrooms, creamed spinach and much heralded triple-cooked chips. Great wine list here - the Pinot Noir we opted for was great.I'm glad we came here - it was more casual than Gaucho's but trendy and opulent enough to make it a special occasion.",

    "text": "I used to work right near the one in Spitalfields and was a regular so imagine my delight when the new one opened round the corner from where I now work in Covent Garden.Managed to get a table there last week with two friends.I knew to expect sumptuous steaks that would make me feel leaden in my feet for three days afterwards.What I wasn't expecting was the grand surroundings when you consider how ordinary the east london building is.The huge cellar type room is spectacular. Brick walls and lots of wood. The sort of place you can sink into and never want to venture outside again.You really feel like you're on a night out here. And that's before you've sat down.Service is friendly if a little casual. I don't want them fawning but a tad more formality might not go amiss after all it isn't cheap. But some people prefer that and I'm happy to go with it.Loud buzzy room. Simple menu. Steak steak and more steak.I had what I always have. A big old rib eye. And I finished every bit. I have to say I always order it medium. I know this is frowned upon but the steaks are big here and I find if you order medium rare a lot of the fat hasn't rendered which can be a little unpleasant. So I tucked my medium steak (not in size you understand, the table groans under the weight of the thing) away with gusto along with the perfectly done greens.We shared a peanut butter shortbread ice cream thing which was delicious even though puddings aren't really for me.Pathetic person that I am I stuck my whereabouts on gowalla (like foursquare) so I could boast on facebook. They have free wifi here and encourage use of it (not that you want to be concentrating on that over your guests obviously). I was thrilled to get a reply from the Hawksmoor themselves via twitter and we entered into a little banter. Not everyone's cup of tea clearly but it shows that these people are on the ball and putting attention into every detail.The bar outside the main dining room was a delight to lounge in.One quibble. We had a lovely bottle of Rioja and followed it up with the house red which, whilst not corked, was completely manky. Steer clear of that one. It's a false economy I warn you.Cheap it isn't but value for money it is. It's everything its sister restaurant is and a whole lot more.Top steak. Top room. Top night. I'll be back.",

    "text": "This place was freaking amazing. First off, I would like to say this is definitely a special occasion restaurant. It's very expensive.I'm just gonna skip the stuff about ambiance, since I had no complaints about that- it was great. I'm just so excited to talk about the food.Ok, so we're gonna start with the bone marrow and onions. This was a great starter! It was rich from the marrow and sweet from the onion. I woulda licked the bone if people weren't watching. I wish there was more bread though, to spread my marrow on.Next I got the scallop appetizer. It was spectacular, the scallops were cooked perfectly, and seasoned with a very nice herby butter that pairs perfectly with the slightly sweet scallop. Definitely get this.Onto the sides, the roasted mushrooms were delicious. Nothing too fancy, just a perfectly roasted mushroom. Yum. The tomato salad was also very good. It was light and sweet and salty. The mint and basil tones in it were very nice. The shallot also added a hint of acidity and sweetness. The tomatoes were super juicy and I found myself taking bite after bite of this to complement my steak.Yum! Here come the mains. First we have the roasted sea bream. We got it with the full fish, not filleted. It was so flaky and soft. The herbs really perfumes this fish amazingly. You could taste the hints of rosemary with each bite. It was wonderful. Plus there was a piece of garlic that was roasted with it, that ended up being perfectly roasted for eating. I love roast garlic.Ok ok, now what you've all been waiting for. The steak. The t-bone was made at a perfect edge to edge medium rare. You could taste the beefiness in each bite, and the fat was rendered very well for an medium rare steak. You could eat every piece with minimal chewing. It was that tender. The Maldon salt applied before being served is really amazing at giving that amazing flavor to the steak. When we finished all the meat, there was still a bone left to gnaw on. And unlike with the bone marrow, I didn't care that people were watching me. I gnawed on that bone until it was clean.Point is, this place is great, and if you decide to come, consider inviting me. I'd be glad to join you, no matter how creepy you might be(if you paid).",

Now here's the embarrassing part. I was so busy shoving food in my mouth, I neglected to take a photo of the rib-eye I was eating (haha). It was perfectly cooked, but to really make it sing, don't forget to order a sauce and some sides. I enjoyed the anchovy hollandaise (not so much my friend because well, you either love anchovies or you don't), but we both loved the macaroni and cheese. And for the finale, sticky toffee pudding. It had the perfect level of sweetness. I could have eaten two servings if we didn't have a curtain call to make. Definitely try this place!

    "text": "Back in May I took my first trip to Europe with some friends for my birthday. We met up with the cousins of one of my friends and they took us to Hawksmoor as they told us it was one of the top steakhouses in London if not the best. This place did not disappoint. The staff were very courteous, from the bouncer to the hostess to the bartender to our waiter. From the looks of it I think the building was originally a brewery which adds to the ambiance. \u00a0For a starter we had the bone marrow with onions the roast scallops with white port and garlic. I have never had bone marrow, growing up my mom used to always suck it out of chicken bones but it never seemed appetizing to me. I'm not sure if I'd try it the way my mom did but Hawksmoor definitely hit a home run with this dish, not sure if I should use a futbol (soccer) or cricket reference instead but I can't think of one. I'll be honest, I just tried to look it up but got confused. Back to the review. For dinner we decided to share two large cut steaks, the T-bone and the porterhouse. The best steaks I have had in some time, not to sound like an arrogant/ignorant American but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the steak were. I cannot wait for Hawksmoor NYC to open at the end of the year. For sides we had tripled cooked chips (fries), mash & gravy and creamed spinach, both equally delicious. Another notch on their belt is their dessert menu, very impressive selection for a steakhouse. We had the sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream, the peanut butter shortbread with salted caramel ice cream and a lemon sorbet.",

Even now looking back I can still remember how beautiful the food and drink was and what a wonderful time we had, we were all completely salivating over it! The food was stunning, we went for the three course express lunch option - we all had caeser salad to start with; steak for our main - I had the stilton sauce and it was utterly divine; and for dessert I had the toffee sundae which was delicious. Our wine, a Spanish red, was gorgeous and I would definitely recommend it and have it again as it was extremely drinkable. The service was fantastic - the staff were really friendly; knowledgeable, helpful and quick. The atmosphere was lively and buzzy and full of a variety of people, though we did keep laughing at the amount of businessmen there and we just kept saying it's because of the meat! I would definitely return here and have since recommended Hawksmoor to lots of people!",

A bartender is immediately on hand to provide a welcome cocktail or wine from a pricey and steak focused list. Then it is onto the burgers (well, at least for me, as other options are available). These come in three varieties. The burger of the month (no really), the kimchi and the Hawksmoor (served with Ogleshield or Colston Basset Stilton). All are more than a mouthful. On the side both beef dripping chips or triple cooked chips are available. Again, all is well.Maybe one day I will venture into the restaurant and tuck into a rib eye (I have heard good things). However, the burger bar (my name) may well continue to be irresistible.",

After entering the place you go downstairs and either into the restaurant for a meat fest or to the bar for the bar menu. I went for the bar as I wanted to try the burger. The place was pretty much deserted around the time (1.30 on a Monday) and the staff were quick to take my order. Overall, the service I received was excellent. I couldn't believe how quickly the served me my order, the kimchi burger with triple-cooked chips. After the first bite I instantly understood the rave reviews. Succulent burger with fresh, crunchy kimchi and smothered in cheese. Maybe not good for you but when it taste so good then who cares? In short, the burger is all people make it out to be: outstanding. Go. Eat. Now.",

Slightly upscale (meaning a lot of suits), not cheap - the burger is not on the Restaurant Menu, but on the Bar menu, just ask for it and is fabulous. When I was there, they had a monthly burger special - this is the most cost effective option for Hawksmoor anyway. Then there are the steaks, I had a 800g Prime Rib and it is just meat Nirvana. Accompanied by a Cabernet, Domaine Du Haut Bourg just perfect. When you feel your heart struggling with that combination of meat and wine, have a dessert is will certainly kill you, but with a smile on your face.",

My friend and I were in a slight rush, so we were glad to see to hear that there was an \"express menu\" option. I opted for the rib-eye steak and my friend went for the roast chicken, whilst we shared a goat's curd spring salad. We waited 15-20 minutes for the salad to arrive, and we weren't impressed. The salad was very clunky...the goat's curd completely overpowered it. Afterwards, it took another half hour for our mains to arrive. I can sympathise with lengthy waits between courses if the kitchen is swamped - but the dining room was barely half full. I can't fault the quality of meat here though. My rib-eye was perfectly cooked (medium rare as ordered), and tasted incredible. A minor criticism, but there were a few times when I could taste flakes of sea salt. My friend's chicken was nice, but nothing outstanding.Service was slow, but fine. All in all, great steak, but I was let down by the long wait times and average service.",

    "text": "I've been following Will @Hawksmoor on Twitter for a while. The photos, sorry, 'food porn' was too much. I had to go. I went along to a Qype event pre-launch. In fact, they open the doors to the public today. The friendly, knowledgeable drink mixologist behind the bar showed us the cocktail ingredients of yesteryear such as benedictine and herbal infusions displayed in antique glassware as he prepared a drinke of olde. I later found out the guy was 'Shakey Pete', apparently one of the greatest barmen this century (who dresses like he's from the beginning of the last century). My inquisitiveness and interest in the apothecary type display of ingredients was rewarded with Pete spraying an odd looking cigar infusion alcohol onto a paper napkin. I naturally sniffed the soaked napkin, looking like a scene in a film noir before things go terribly wrong. However, it was a bizzarre aroma that was surprisingly pleasant and an example of the ingredient uniqueness of the drinks on offer that are certainly not boring. I later sipped some of the Zombie cocktail that had a absinthe flame burning a top of the large sundae style glass. It was delicious. Over to the food, this place is about meat. The sight of the bone marrow was way over exciting, even after recently enjoying the same dish at St John Restaurant. However the 'half-pipe' sliced bones mant far easier scooping out than the tubular bones. I had a chance to try the lamb cutlets that were so good I had a cheeky second one just to check my taste buds weren't tricking me. I spotted what looked like crayfish on brioche and politely passed the offer. I later found out this was a \u00a320 warm lobster roll which was apparently delicious. Fail. I also tried the kimchi burger in which the pickled-fermented-Korean vegetable resembled shredded carrot. In fact, me and fellow Qyper Bring_Stuff decided this tasted like a shepherd's pie burger, however, this may have been down to the deceptive kimchi looking carrot-like. Either way it was fine. I also realised the other burger they do contains nuggets of bone marrow. Yes, I am obsessed. This place is eclectic, eccentric and extravagant. The drinks are amazing and the food is incredible. It's not cheap, but it is special. I'll be back for some of that bone marrow burger and to actually confirm the legend status of their steaks.",

    "text": "I love this place. It took me a while to 'get it' and to ease into the venue, but I was flitting between two tables of happy Qypers trying to catch up with everyone. Not an easy feat. AND whilst I was doing that, Qypers were all stealing the yummy food! Surely there's a rule that means the hostess gets fed first? No? Oh fine then. Of the food I did manage to nab from the greedy hands of Qypers, I'd do very very bad things for those lamb cutlets. Unspeakably so. They were possibly the best lamb cutlets I've ever had. Don't taste like that when I cook 'em. I also tried some fantastic lobster. Mmmmm, lobster. And whilst everyone else was dousing their oysters in tabasco (even Hawkmoor can't convince me to try another oyster in my lifetime), I decided to work my way through their cocktail menu and prop up the bar. I tried a Hawksmoor Julep, which was basically a historical forest in a glass (love that they've gone back in time with their classics). Mint, and all sorts of yummy things (despite us not being able to recognise thyme, and thinking it was heather, and also sage, and rosemary, we're not very clever). And there were zombies to be drunk (between four) and interesting things on the bar like tobacco bitters and tiny little decanters of Benedictine. And then, I finally understood the venue. It's a flip around of the Shoreditch venue (if you've been, you can't help but compare the two). So this one has more focus on the bar, and the cocktails. That's not to say they don't to their famed steaks though, just poke your head into the cavernous dining room, try not to stare when you see the ceilings. This is everything Hawksmoor is and better. Their five stars is cemented by their red wine and their charming bar staff. I have no idea what red I was drinking, but it was fantastically easy to drink. I didn't get home until 1am. Everyone around my table seemed to be sipping it whilst I wasn't looking. Pesky buggers. But I'll come back just for the wine. And then I'll maybe have a cocktail, and ooooh some beef dripping chips (which were gone by the time we got hungry again) and some cutlets and oooh would you lookit that, I'm drunk and I've gone through the entire bar menu. Sneaky genius, right there. I can't wait. Book ahead, won't you? There's no way this place won't be packed out every night. (Thanks to Will and Hawksmoor for hosting such a lovely event for Qype, some of our food and drink was complimentary.)",

Which you really can't ask for much more.Its the perfect place to have either lunch or dinner, although I would suggest that if you have a busy afternoon ahead, perhaps save the trip here for another day, because eating half a cow could leave you a little lethargic.Previously having been here in the past, it was a logical choice for my meeting with a rugby player, and needless to say it went down well. Sadly as he had another meeting afterward he was unable to sample the wonder Juniper cocktails (all of which I have sampled), which was a shame as he is a gin fan. Not to worry, what a great excuse to go back again. ;o)",

Though I ordered peppercorn sauce on the side, it was pretty much unnecessary and didn't add to the meal. The peppercorn sauce was a smooth cream sauce that actually didn't have much of a peppercorn taste. (I would have liked it more peppery.)The sticky toffee pudding was a tad too sweet but clotted cream on the side really helped balance out the dessert. In fact, I liked the clotted cream the most.Friendly service though 12.5% tip is automatically added on the bill.",

The atmosphere had a high end pub feel to it which was different and a nice change of pace. Given that it was 12:30pm and we had just woken up, we decided to only go with one Sunday roast to share with some sides. Ended up going with the sourdough bread and butter to start the meal off. I found the butter to have a nice texture and the bread to be good, but nothing spectacular. I ended up getting a August Town pale ale which is made exclusively for the restaurant but unfortunately didn't come from a tap. There ended up being a small piece of glass on the underside of my mug and the server graciously offered me another beer which I happily accepted. The roast itself, whole nothing truly ground breaking in terms of technique, truly felt like such a cohesive meal. While the meat could be from a better cut, it was cooked a perfect medium rare and had great char. The horseradish was mild but tasty. The additional clove of garlic and head of grilled shallot was a nice touch and the cooked carrots and greens complemented the meal perfectly. The potatoes were crispy and inherently dry but when paired with the gravy, it made for a great combination. We also added a side of mac cheese which went very well with the rest of the dish. We ended the meal with our first sticky toffee pudding which was to die for! Top 10 desserts I've ever had, no doubt.This place is worth coming to but yet your reservations in ahead of time!",

Ordered bone marrow, spice-roast cauliflower, rib eye, and lobster. I like the way they prepare their steak as it would not be too salty! Also, portion was just right, and I did not feel I overate! However, I was a bit disappointed for the lobster. It was over-cooked, and the texture was rough. The other downside was that space is very limited, and I felt a bit cramping. Overall, great experience, and I will come back for their steaks!",

    "text": "I had barely slept during the flight over from the US, and after landing at 7 AM and working a full day in the office, I was ready to sit inside my hotel room and order room service. \u00a0But then I thought to myself: \"NO! \u00a0I'm in London!\" \u00a0I couldn't let something trivial like jet lag stop me from exploring the culinary wonders of the city!Like any good Yelper, I had done my homework beforehand and had Hawksmoor on my shortlist of places to try based on recommendations from local Yelpers and other coworkers, so I laced up my shoes and made the short trek over to Covent Garden to check it out.Thankfully, there was no wait on a Monday night - I showed up and was seated immediately even without prior reservations. \u00a0After checking out their offerings, I ended up ordering from their \"Express Menu,\" which is where you can order a starter, an entr\u00e9e, and a dessert as a prix-fixe deal.For my starter, I ordered their Bone Marrow and WOW was this superb! \u00a0Two huge bones dripping in rendered fat and marrow, liberally covered in caramelized onions and featuring two hefty chunks of bread on the side to mop it all up. \u00a0I devoured everything; the sweetness of the onions perfectly complemented the saltiness and richness of the marrow. \u00a0Honestly, the starter was filling enough on its own, but then my main entr\u00e9e arrived - 200g of beef fillet with a side of peppercorn sauce and a dish of buttered English greens. \u00a0The fillet was cooked perfectly as I requested (rare) and quite tender, although I would have like a better sear on the outside. \u00a0The peppercorn sauce was a bit of a letdown unfortunately... on the watery side and not \"peppery\" at all.For dessert, I wanted to try a \"classic\" British option, so I chose the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and this was AMAZING. \u00a0The pudding itself was the perfect consistency, absorbing all the lovely caramel sauce without getting too spongy or soggy. \u00a0It came topped with a light custard that just perfectly balanced all the heavy richness of the pudding and sauce. \u00a0Now I'm wishing more restaurants in the States offered this as a dessert option!OVERALL: 4/5. \u00a0The beef fillet was very good, but just a little under what I was expecting for such a highly rated steakhouse. \u00a0On the other hand, the bone marrow starter and sticky toffee pudding dessert were both total 5/5s. \u00a0Glad I was able to eat here during my trip!",

    "text": "I came here with my girlfriend for dinner before our musical. I have heard great things about Hawksmoor and was very excited about finally trying out the 'best steak in London'. The location is a bit awkward, hidden away from the main streets, which led to a bit of tardiness on our part arriving 15 minutes late for our reservation. However, upon arriving, the friendly receptionist quickly guided us to our seats. Our seats were fantastic, right in the centre of the restaurant. Each table was decorated with a candle, that combined with the dim lighting of the restaurant gave it a great ambiance for the romantic date I wanted. The waiters were all extremely polite and friendly, but the place was busy despite our decision to dine before 6 so a lady, who I assume a manager of sorts, had to step in and take our orders. The food came swiftly after our order. I ordered the bone marrow with onions for my first course, and my girlfriend got the potted mackerel. The bone marrow, served as two gigantic bones cut in half and stuffed with marrow and caramelised onion, was absolutely sublime . However, the bread that came along with the dish was a bit burnt. The mackerel was also quite delicious, coming in a small jar with jelly and garlic bread. My girlfriend did say half way through the pot that it tasted very much like tuna, just very high end tuna. Overall, very satisfied with the flavour and overall presentation of our appetisers. Both my girlfriend and I ordered the ribeye for our main. My girlfriend, who seldom eats steak, absolutely loved hers and said that she is definitely thinking of ordering steak in the future. I have very high standards for my steaks, and I often cook my own. That is why I was slightly disappointed by the medium rare ribeye that was still red in the middle. The steak was seasoned simply, just salt and pepper as I do at home, but the charred mark made the steak untastefully bitter at times. Our sides of fries and sweet potatoes were wonderfully done. I am worried that the steaks they served on the express menu were not of the same quality they serve if you simply ordered it a la carte. We ran out of time, or else would have definitely like to try one of their deserts. Overall, great starter, average steak. I would appreciate a bit more care on their part to not have burnt my bread. However, I would still like to come back and give their steaks another try.",

    "text": "I am torn about how to rate Hawksmoor Seven Dials. On the one hand, food itself, the cocktail program and the setting merit 5 stars, but problems with wine service service and our experience with the sommelier are closer to 1 or 2 stars.My husband and I chose this steakhouse to celebrate his birthday and our moving to London. After a crazy day of unpacking boxes and assembling furniture, we were ready for some steak! The experience started off beautifully - the old subterranean brewery feels wonderfully atmospheric and the cocktail list has something for everyone - I started off with the Bloody Mary Number 7, with horseradish-infused gin and a splash of porter. Even my husband liked it and he does not normally like bloody marys. I can't remember which cocktail he had, but we both liked it, and the rest of the list looked great.I have no complaints about the food itself. We started off with Brixham crab on toast and Caesar salad - both simple but delicious - and for mains, I had ribeye and my husband had one of the massive bone-in cuts, and we shared a few veggie sides. The steaks were some of the best we've ever had, and we like our steaks.However, wine service nearly wrecked our dinner. We found it very difficult to find a wine we were looking for. Basically, we wanted a new world version of a Bordeaux grape or blend. The way the wine list is written - listed by price as opposed to style or region - without tasting notes - might make sense for those for whom the primary consideration when choosing a wine is price, but for those of us who are actually looking for a specific style of wine, it is confusing. We ordered a California cabernet franc, and without being able to get any additional information from our server, who wasn't interested in answering our questions, we assumed it would be a typical California cab franc - rich, lots of green vegetable and herbal notes, touch of black pepper. WRONG! The wine was so light as to be practically a rose. The sommelier - who finally saw fit to come talk to us - graciously agreed to take the wine back and recommend a new bottle - saying, \"Yes, this is very different from the usual style!\" Well, why didn't our server tell us when we asked, or why didn't he send the sommelier if he didn't know? When we described what we were looking for, he indicated two possible wines - a Chilean Cab Franc and an Argentine Malbec/Petit Verdot blend. We asked him to describe the two wines so we could decide which one sounded better to us. All he could come up with was \"full bodied.\" To be fair, my husband and I are American and looking scruffy as we had been moving house all weekend, so perhaps we were judged as not being capable of understanding a more thorough description of the wines we were considering ordering, but in a restaurant of Hawksmoor's caliber and price point, I expect the sommelier to have a bit more willingness to talk about the wines and make recommendations based on what customers actually want, beyond just price and \"full bodied,\" even if he judges those customers to be unsophisticated. And it being a birthday dinner, we had ordered high-end steaks, cocktails and mid-range wines, so it was not as though we had ordered burgers and \"your cheapest red.\" I still don't know whether the issue was simply that the sommelier did not have a thorough knowledge of his wine list or whether he thought we were \"the wrong sort\" (based on his tone and body language while speaking to us), but either scenario is completely unacceptable for a restaurant that boasts about its superior wine program and that clearly put a lot of effort into designing a diverse list with so many choices.We ordered the Malbec/Petit Verdot after trying to extract as much information from the sommelier as we could about the wine, and unfortunately, it was also not right - it had quite a lot of residual sugar and tasted oxidized. Graciously, the sommelier agreed to let us order yet a different bottle, and we finally decided to just play it safe and ordered some Bordeaux because at least we'd know what we were getting in the absence of a sommelier willing to tell us more \u00a0- which turned out to be adequate but unremarkable.In all, the whole process of finding a suitable wine for our steaks took a very long time and we were the last customers to finish up. The server was kind enough to comp our dessert for us. However, as we were finishing up, a mouse ran across the floor. To be fair, it's an old, underground space and these things happen, but ICK!In all, I hope our experience with the sommelier was atypical, because I really want to like this restaurant. It's a cool space with great food and cocktails in an area of London where many restaurants are chains or overpriced tourist traps. Maybe I'll give them another shot for a future special occasion, or maybe not.",

My family and friends came here for Sunday Lunch and Hawksmoor didn't disappoint.I had a Mint Julep to start, they serve about 8 of them and some contain rum instead of whiskey. They are served in a metal cup, which is the perfect way to serve a Mint Julep. They also serve a drink called \"The Zombie\" and it comes with the warning that they will only serve you one since it's liable to knock you out, needless to say I'll be going back for one.The Sunday Roast is the only way to go on a Sunday. The beef was perfectly cooked and the entire table shut up once the food arrived, always a good sign.",

    "text": "The Meat Sweats give me a sense of both slight disgust and satisfying triumph. \u00a0After all, there's nothing quite like seeing the slight surprise on the waiter's face after seeing a fairly skinny guy pack away a 24 oz Porterhouse on his own. \u00a0I don't often eat steak out, partially due to the expense, but also because most of the time it's cheaper and better to go to a butcher and do it yourself. \u00a0However, with Hawksmoor...let's just say, more like...HawksMORE.Before I start, a word to the wise: the roasted bone marrow starter with caramelised onions is absolutely delicious (and is comically huge), but it is not advisable to eat a whole one before a large hunk of steak. \u00a0It almost killed me, and I had a meat hangover the next day. \u00a0I'm not even joking.My experience here was top notch from start to finish - the cocktail menu is really quite excellent and I'm definitely considering going to the bar here at some point as there are a ton of drinks I want to try.The main dining area has a nice, relaxing feel to it. \u00a0I particularly like the availability board showing the weights of the different cuts available. \u00a0Needless to say, the meat is fantastic - my rare T-bone was as it should be, melt in the mouth, full of flavour, and with a sumptuous cowglaze coating. \u00a0Ah, there's nothing quite like totally violating your Daily-Mail-Sanctioned-Red-Meat-Weekly-Allowance in one evening.Really excited about my next trip here - hopefully next time I'll be able to fit in a pudding too...",

    "text": "Ok, so rocking up at ten on a Friday night after a few lagers wasn't going to be the best introduction to the meaty joy that should be a night at Hawksmoor but, having been to a recent and successful Steak Club at their older brother in Liverpool Street, at least one of the gang knew what to expect.We went expecting the finest burgers, perfect post pub fodder, and were drooling at the description of the Third Burger, a rotating option aside their classic hamburger and the Kimchi Burger, a spicy Korean melange attracting Marmite-like attention from the reviewing community. This month's Third Burger was enthusiastically sold to us by our bubbly server, and promised a topping of pulled pork rib topping the Longhorn and bone marrow patty, enthusiastically moulded from the best the Ginger Pig has to offer.After that description we were sold. Draft brew (slightly too floral) arrived in pint pots which, along with the communal bar tables and the uber-friendly staff gave the reservation free bar area the feel of an up-market American frat bar.At this point our server, mortified, appeared from the kitchen to inform us of the end of the burgers for the night. Made fresh, the fridge was bare, and the burger had to wait for another day. Instead we went for the bone-in Prime Rib and the Porterhouse. Two full kilograms of meat serving to sate three hungry (slightly drunk) men. Minimum sides needed, the steak was sufficient.Many have tried to describe these steaks, I can't really see the point. Cooked perfectly, they're sweet and meaty joy. Start by imagining the best steak you remember tasting. Now imagine the steak that steak wanted to be when it grew up, and then you're part of the way there. The triple cooked chips were a little lacklustre and passed hardly noticed, though the bone marrow went alongside the steak perfectly.It's not the cheapest night out. A kilogram hunk of the finest steak will set you back around \u00a365, though that should feed two (normal) people and you get a pretty decent list of smaller cuts, at around the \u00a320 to \u00a325 mark.If you're a fan of culinary subtlety (or heaven forbid, vegetables) then Hawksmoor isn't the most obvious place to come. And while I plan on bringing my other half here, it's not the most obvious place for a date night. Bring your friends instead, grab a hunk of prime rib, and settle down for a dose of the meat sweats.",

This place made me devour excessively and I loved every minute of it. It's such a friendly place, a well designed restaurant with the emphasis on the quality of the food and the satisfaction of the customer. There is little or no formality; you're served by wonderfully casual hippie servers who know their stuff, passionate about food and genuinely happy to help.If you like gin and especially gin cocktails this is your place, so so so many on the list and the one I had was wonderfully sublime and refreshing on a hot day. They also had a huge selection of whiskeys, with everything from a 15 year old Springbank, to to several Japanese whiskeys to a great peaty Monkey Shoulder. I was of course utterly charming and the barmaid let us taste all of them! (hic)The food nearly made me cry in pleasure; heaven!Boneless spare ribs with a fennel, cumin, chilli and maple syrup sauce.A sublimely tender and rare 55 day aged T-Rump, chips fried three times, (three times just to make totally sure at least one thing here is fully cooked!)This left no room for dessert \u00a0but all topped with a good cabernet sauvignon (Hawk Crest 2006, Napa) I need to try more scrummy things that will also destroy my anti red meat diet like the bone marrow or the kimchi burgers. nom nom nom",

I really dug the layout of the joint with low lighting and a separate bar area. The menu was superb, I went with the surf & turf with the Stilton dressing for the filet. My lobster & filet was perfectly cooked. My side of choice was the macaroni & cheese. My husband went with the 1kg bone in prime rib which was sheer massively delicious. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a big meal night out. Reservations are needed for dinner. Smart casual on dress. Decent cocktails for the slow sippers.",

Safe to say I was sceptical but soon my worries were gone as I can safely say this was hands down the best steak I have ever had. The wait for food was a little longer than average but as we had cocktails to sip on we didn't really notice. The staff were friendly and checked on us every so often to make sure things were ok, as well as taking time to explain all the different steaks. The fries complimented the steak well and as a whole was a wonderful meal. It was very busy but I think it just gave a nice atmosphere which was nice. I had the rib-eye steak which I definitely recommend - was full of flavour and cooked perfectly. I would recommend (and have done) this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor - best steak in LondonFood (steaks):I've tried a variety of cuts namely Bone-in Prime Rib, Porterhouse, and the Rib-eye. Obviously each is slightly different but each is phenomenal for what it's meant to be.Generally awesome marbling and perfect seasoning meaning that each bite is a joy. I prefer to avoid the sauces (because you really don't need them) and just go with a dash of mustard.Food (burgers):I've only had the hawksmoor burger once, and I was hungover so standards might have been lower. That being said, it was a little piece of heaven. Juicy (so so juicy), flavorful, moist, tender, the right size, bun came toasted and didn't completely dissolve as you ate the burger. For 15 pounds, it can't be beat. (Nb. Hawksmoor burger only available at Seven Dials and Guildhall)Sides:Solid but underwhelming. If only Hawksmoor and Goodman could merge (Hawkman!) and serve steaks from the former and sides from the latter, true perfection would have been achieved. That being said, they're decent and great value. Bone marrow is an absolute steal at 4 pounds, the triple cooked chips are decent, likewise for creamed spinach and Mac and cheese.Desserts:I'm usually too full, but special mention for the cornflake ice cream (also available as a milkshake). Invented at momofuku and now a fairly global trend, this whole idea of cereal flavoured desserts is definitely a winning combination.Note: I had an average experience at Spitafields once where everything was criminally under seasoned. Probably best to stick to Seven Dials to be safe.",

The ambience was exactly what I imagined it would be like to eat at a restaurant in London: loud, mysterious, underground, dimly lit, and comfortable to the extreme. The ribeye steak I ordered was the best beef I've ever had (by a long shot) and it was cooked to perfection. \u00a0I found myself a favorite drink in Shaky Pete's Ginger Brew, which was equivalent to tasting something straight out of a Harry Potter book. The salad, apps, and sides were too good to even believe it was real life. The waiter had the most above-and-beyond sense of hospitality and more charisma than I thought was humanly possible. (Definitely not something you'd find in the US) To top it all off, the Sticky Toffee Pudding was easily in the Top 5 things I've ever tasted in 30 years of existence. Most importantly was that this place offered one of the most unique \"last night of vacation\" dinners I've ever been fotunate enough to share with my family. We are a very picky bunch, and pleasing everyone in our party is a rare occasion. More than just making everyone happy, this place knocked our socks off with the tastes that hit our table. \u00a0I can't wait to visit London again to find myself back at one of the Hawksmoors. This is an imperative stop \u00a0if you're visiting The Old Smoke.",

The burger is topped with Guebben chese, pickle, lettuce, red onion, a house sauce, and served with a side of housemade ketchup. All of this is packed onto a tender brioche bun. I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked to perfection with a nice char. The beef was juicy and had a lot of flavor. However, it's a shame that this great piece of beef is paired with some confused ingredients. The Guebben cheese is rather powerful and combines with the house made ketchup that is very tangy/sour as well. I only added the house made ketchup to the burger after my first few bites; since I found the burger was lacking some salt/acid to really make your mouth water. Overall, this is a solid burger if you do not put the awful house made ketchup on top. The bun is great, the beef is great, the other condiments work well...it is just one sauce or cheese substitution away from being a fantastic burger.",

No, No, he said...I know a place that is better! So we followed his advice and wound up at - An American steakhouse in the touristy part of the West End - just what we did NOT want! So, we pulled out our trusty Google Maps app and navigated our way over to the Hawksmoor. And it was soooo worth the trip.It was very crowded when we arrived at about 9PM, but they were able to seat us right away in the bar area, which was fine with us. We debated over the wine list, as we were unfamiliar with the choices in our price range. Seeing our dilemma, our helpful waiter sent over their sommelier, who steered us to a bottle that he felt would suit us. Our mission for the night - aside from satisfying our primal desire to gorge on a really fine hunk of meat - was to try things that we were, as Americans, unfamiliar with. \u00a0So here is a summary of what I had... (I'd tell you what the rest of my group had, but after two bottles of wine and a dessert Scotch I find I don't really remember!)Starters - Potted Beef with bacon and Yorkshires - 8.50Where do I begin? Perhaps I should compose a Broadway love song in honor of this dish, it was so incredibly good. The rich gravy, the delicious Yorkshire...all incredibly melt in your mouth and savory...I could have been happy with this dish alone for the night. Steak - the Ribeye, done medium rare - 30.00If you are a steak lover, well...you came to the right place. Hawksmoor knows steak, and serves only the best. This was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had, cooked to perfection. \u00a0The portion was more than enough for one person.Sides - I know we all shared the following:Triple cooked chipsElliot's Bread and ButterRoast field mushroomsThey were all good, but didn't stand out in my memory - they were just happy side dishes that complemented the food.Dessert - I opted for a closing glass of Scotch rather than a sweet, and can tell you wholeheartedly that you cannot go wrong with the Highland Park 12 year old. Enough said.So, food aside - about the Hawksmoor itself. We arrived from the cold outdoors into a waiting room that was cozy and warm. The folks greeting us at the door were very friendly, even though the place was clearly incredibly busy. We fully expected to be turned away, as we had not made a reservation, but they offered to seat us in the bar area, and we jumped at the chance. The wait staff in the bar area were incredibly friendly and attentive, taking lots of time to sit with us and explain the options for wine, food, and anything else we cared to ask about. And this is one note - while I enjoyed the friendly banter and very friendly approach of the waiters, other people in my party would have preferred a more formal approach. So, if you would prefer white glove, more aloof interactions, this is not the place for you.The place itself has lots of ambience and atmosphere, and doesn't feel touristy at all. Next time I am in London, I will visit the Hawksmoor again!",

In fact, we've never had anything less than a superlative experience there. We like the Covent Garden location because it's easy to reach from the tube station and is of course very central. The hamburgers are lovely, but the bone marrow starter and their chips are really fantastic. I especially love the porterhouse, medium rare, which I sometimes share with other people.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor is consistently solid. I normally visit the Hawksmoor in Knightsbridge but gave Seven Dials a shot as Knightsbridge was fully booked.Unsurprisingly, the experience was pretty much exactly the same as other Hawksmoor locations. Always dark and broody, generally swift service and friendly wait staff. The steaks are solid without being amazing and there's a variety of sides ranging from super healthy to decadent.The wines by the glass list at Seven Dials could've been deeper - I think there was about 6 to choose from? From memory other locations have a longer list including some NZ reds.In short, if the price was about 25%~30% cheaper it might come in at 5 stars. You can get equal or better steaks in Australian restaurants for about 50% of the price but hey - this is London after all!",

If you would like a treat and a little cure for a hangover head to the hawksmoor in the city and they will fix you. It costs about \u00a334 for the breakfast and there is too much food for two people on it. The food is grilled on a charcoal grill and tastes delightful. They serve cocktails named \"anti fogmatics\" to clear away your fog, these include a fantastic Bloody Mary.I would definitely recommend the Hawksmoor",

    "text": "Without a doubt the Hawksmoor is one of London's great steakhouses. 5 huge stars. It is my go to place for meat. Their Sunday roast is one of the best meals you can possibly have. Perfectly executed roast of beef accompanied by triple cooked chips, glazed veggies, decadent gravy and of course a Yorkshire pudding. The only down-side is that the Hawksmoor also serves one of the best burgers in London...a decadent patty with nuggets of bone marrow and has arguably London's best assortment of steaks (bone in rib eye!) on the menu. Ah, the dilema of too many choices!The Hawksmoor serves delicious cocktails...while it's renown (and rightfully so) for its amazing collection juleps...the real winner on the beverage menu is the Bottle Manhattan for 2 or 4 (note nothing is stopping you for having the Manhattan for 4 when there are just 2 of you). It's a make yourself Manhattan served with all the accompaniments you would expect.The Seven Dials Location is a massive underground space with plenty of large tables \u00a0(perfect for a big group).Going to the Hawksmoor for roast is an absolute must!",

The fish is brought daily from Mitch Tonks in Dartmouth, whose restaurant Rockfish there I had just enjoyed days before not knowing any relationship prior to the Hawksmoor server telling me. She was great by the way! The home made ketchup for the chips was spectacular as well but I took a star away for the chips. Good but plain and didn't seem hand cut. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was the best I've ever had though I must say I'd prefer a scoop of great vanilla ice cream on top instead of the clotted cream. I'm sure you can ask for that. Excellent pricing on the 3 course lunch menu and you can easily split one menu between two people.",

Checked into the bar first where me and a friend ordered the champagne Charlie's. Very, refreshing glass of gin lemon moet champagne concoction. Goes very well with any type of dishes from their menu. I opted for the grilled chicken and was surprised to how large the plate was. For a very small person like myself, found it extremely difficult to finish and also the chicken itself was very dry!!!! Needed a sauce or gravy, not something I'd order again. The triple cooked chips were ok, but the English herb salad was light and refreshing. The service was good and was happy. I'd revisit again, and definitely choose something different, maybe a lighter option so I leave space for dessert. Great concept inside, love the bar area, very welcoming and staff are very friendly.Very pleased and happy to return again :)",

The regular dining room doesn't open until 5:00 pm, so we sat in a booth in the bar and it was great - it didn't effect the service or experience at all. Leo was our server, and he was amazing! If we went back we would ask for him specifically. He made the whole dining experience so fun and enjoyable. We ordered everything he suggested, even if it was something we wouldn't have normally ordered. And, all of his recommendations were SPOT-ON. The shining star of the dinner was the Ribeye steak with Stilton Hollandaise sauce. This was absolutely the best steak I've ever had in my life. (Better than OXO Tower.) I've been to London 4 times now and this was by far the best dining experience I've had while traveling here. My only regret is that I was too full to get desert. I can only imagine how delicious it would have been!",

    "text": "Recommended by a coworker, this was my first meal in London and by far the most memorable. We came around 5:30 for the Express Menu - 23 GBP for 2 dishes or 26 for 3. Started off with the Caesar Salad, which was nice and different 'cause it was the whole leaf. But WHY didn't I order the Bone Marrow which was simply mind blowing. Luckily our friend let us try a bite. It was my first time eating bone marrow and it was DELICIOUS. The caramelized onions on top paired with the mushy bone marrow - perfect combination that reminds me of French onion soup. Even better eaten on top of the crispy toast, which is slightly burnt and buttery. The presentation was also nice - a large portion sliced lengthwise instead of in chunks which imo looks much less appetizing. For the main, we all got the rib eye. Sauces are extra so my plate was literally just a piece of meat. It was very tender. For the side, I got the chips - thick cut, crispy outside, fluffy inside and slightly salty - Yum! But even better was the Beef Dripping Potatoes , which is potato chunks, crispy outside, fluffy inside. The ketchup also tastes good with a slight Worchershire sauce flavor. I was too full for dessert but I did try a bite of the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was heavenly! Also my first time trying; I had always imagined it to be super sweet and caramel-y, but the texture was more like a warm lava cake, moist but not too dense, with just the right amount of toffee/caramel flavor.The bone marrow and sticky toffee pudding were so good that we had to return for lunch a few days after to eat it again (and that's saying a lot, with the limited time in London and the abundance of good food choices!)This time, we tried the Burger (cooked medium rare, with blue cheese. very big portion) and the Whole Sea Bream - very nicely cooked. The sides were Buttered Greens (yum! Sprout Tops -more of a thicker leaf), baked sweet potato, and beef dripping potatoes again. Highly recommend this restaurant!",

I ordered a salad, a steak (fillet) \u00a0mash with a cider on the side. My meal was out of this world, and our service was excellent. Would definitely pay Hawksmoor another visit if I'm ever in London again.",

I have had slightly better steak and mac and cheese at another popular steak restaurant but overall experience has probably been better here.

    "text": "Hawksmoor has a good and tasty offering for London standards. Did I have the best steak and sides of my life? No, not even close but it's hard to compete with Dallas steakhouses.First, the restaurant itself is located in a basement and is very large - much larger than I expected. Due to the fact that it is in a basement, there are large columns/poles throughout the restaurant which make traversing the dining room and getting in/out of your table somewhat tricky, especially after a few martinis.Second, the dress code (we visited on a Sunday night) was a bit of everything. There were some who were very dressed up and others who were very casual. My husband and I fit in somewhere in the middle. I donned dark jeans and a dressy top and he also wore dark jeans with a button-down/dress shirt.My husband and I both ordered the bone-in sirloin - both cooked medium. Our two steaks arrived and they were cooked and salted differently. What surprised me is how thin the steaks were. I should have been expecting this but given the Hawsmoor reviews and the fact that it's a bit more upscale, I thought I would be delivered an inch-thick steak as I would be at any steakhouse in Dallas/Fort Worth. So, it was a bit disappointing to see this skinny steak appear in front of me. My steak was pink in the middle but was a bit too overdone for me. Technically, it would fall within the \"medium\" range but more toward the \"well-done\" end of the spectrum versus the \"rare\" end. My husband's steak was opposite, it was cooked medium but more toward the rare end. My steak did not taste that great and his tasted a lot better, so being the southern gentlemen that he is, he switched steaks with me and used a bit of the sauce whilst eating my steak (which is totally sacrilegious, by the way!).For our sides we ordered:1) Macaroni [&] cheese - it was good, our favorite of the sides.2) Mash and gravy - it was OK. Gravy should never be served with mashed potatoes when served with steak. I did not care for the gravy but since it was served already poured over the mashed potatoes, I had no choice but to eat it. I recommend asking for the gravy on the side.3) Creamed spinach - just a warning, this is not the same type of creamed spinach you would get in the States. It was basically muddled spinach with a tiny bit of cream. It somewhat tasted like wilted spinach with no seasoning that had been boiled in water. My husband was terribly disappointed as creamed spinach is one of his favorites.Was the steak at Hawsmoor the best steak I have consumed at a restaurant in London? Yes but to be honest, the steaks we purchase from the butcher (with a thickness of \"two fingers\") and grill at home are far superior, mainly because of the thickness. When steaks are too thin, it is difficult to obtain the salty crust because one must grill them longer and by doing so, runs the risk of overcooking the steak. Would I return to Hawskmoor? Yes but I'd order my steak medium rare, skip the creamed spinach, order the mashed potatoes without gravy and of course, order the mac and cheese.",

    "text": "Just off Covent Garden, at the bottom of Langley Street (a New York-style alleyway, only lacking subway steam and a nunchuck weilding gang) sits Hawksmoor Seven Dials. Just as you get to the bottom of the alley, when you think there couldn't possibly be any kind of thriving business, save one of the less than salubrious establishments Soho is famed for, let alone one of London's pre-eminent and widely praised meat restaurants there it is. This is one of London's worst kept secrets, and a meat shrine at which first timers and regulars alike, worship. The heavy, black wooden doors swing open to reveal a low lit reception, and a bevy of Ma\u00eetre ds efficiently deal with coats, bags and lead you down to the bar for drinks and a wait until your table is ready. It's dark, luxurious and just the sort of place to gain the reputation it has. The scene is set for Burger wars. The classic Hawksmoor burger vs the Kimchi burger. Whilst the classic burger fought well, there are a couple of technical errors in style that let it down \u00a0the bun disintegration, the raw red onion, the dry triple cooked chips. 8.5/10 The Kimchi burger is the clear winner on the night \u00a0great composition, complementary toppings and a great smokey, spicy flavour, and the beef dripping chips are pretty special too! 9.5/10 It's definitely on of the Best Burgers in London: hamburger-me.com/2011/12\u2026",

    "text": "Visited the hawksmoor recently with fellow members of our London Steak club, we had high expectations, it didnt let us down. Having toured most steak restaurants in London now as a group of 18 guys there is little we havent tried but the Hawksmoor raised the bar. We were given the private room (purely luck!) to dine in and then were shown a limited steak menu (we had been told about this in advance). Basically they bought out 5 or 6 plates of varying sizes and cut quality steak and placed on table for us to sample. Sides were very very good and the meat didnt draw one poor comment. The bar area is a little on the small side but service was very good. The surprsing but yet very posiitve thought of the evening was the mix of clients, the norm is 95% men, but this was more 40/60% which created a far more balanced atmosphere. Booking is essentail as they were turning people away on the door and we had booked 3 weeks in advance. Highly recommend, will be back! My only concern is that it may go a little like Goodmans (it got so busy due to success the quality appears to have suffered).. I hope they keep up the wonderful work though!",

    "text": "The food? The drink? The atmosphere? Hawksmoor Steak and Cocktail house has it all. And more. The Seven Dials branch, is located opposite Pineapple Studios, about 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden tube. It's well known for its British meat, supplied by the North York Moors butchers, the Ginger Pig, and for how they cook it simply over charcoal. We got a whiff of delicious charred meaty goodness as we approached the understated entrance doors of the converted brewery, which itself is steeped in brilliant steak related history Its first owner, Alderman Combe, hosted an annual steak supper club back in the 1800's, a members, secret high society sort of affair that catered for those lucky people who preached 'beef and liberty' (hence the fabulous sign on the way down to the bar). I doubt I would have made the list back in the day, but last week, when we were welcomed into the low lit funkily decorated cellar bar by friendly laid back staff who seemed to wear whatever what they liked, I felt like the place was on the casual side of special, minus any of ponce you can get in some London places. The restaurant is partitioned from the bar and still retains some stunning architectural features including a vaulted brick ceiling and huge cast iron columns. If you don't fancy a full blow out meal, the bar area is open for their booze and the famous Kimchi burgers (a traditional Korean dish of fermented vegetables \u00a0for more info go have a read of some reviews by Eat Like a Girl, Young&Foodish, Going with my Gut). The cocktail menu is HUGE and ranges from both classic drinks to down right eccentric concoctions, including Juleps, Tweaked tikis, Punches and Cups and Bridging drinks, a concept for those Victorian young men who had nothing to do after lunch other than drink cocktails and wait until dinner time came round. Shame. Feeling like I wanted to find out exactly what those crazy kids were enjoying so much, I went for the Bridging drink 'Champagne Charlie', a mix of gin, lemon juice and homemade seasonal fruit syrup (blood orange), charged with champagne. Absolutely delicious, sweet and bubbly, yet with the underlying dryness of gin. My boyfriend had the Boulevardier which was a very manly bourbon based cocktail, but unfortunately it was missing the bourbon-soaked cherry promised on the menu, he didn't seem to mind though. We weren't rushed into the restaurant at all, but went through from the bar when we were ready, a nice and relaxing touch. Unfortunately we couldn't sit on our original table next to the wine cellar because the legs were wobbly and there was a brick that looked like it was about to fall out of the ceiling (dangerous much?), so we got moved to a new section with a waiter who was absolutely hilarious. We swiftly made bets with him on when the brick was going to drop. Probably quite bad taste in hindsight, but he continuously made us laugh whilst providing flawless service. We decided to go for starters. I had read A LOT about the Tamworth Belly Ribs, there was no way I wasn't going to try them. And they didn't disappoint. Left on the bone, they were tender, juicy, sweet and sticky. I could have eaten them all over again with their charcoal bbq flavour and crunchy red cabbage. Actually incredible. Mike had the bone marrow and slow cooked onions and he loved them. Spreading the marrow and onions on thick chunky bread (of which there wasn't quite enough), he oohed and aahed at every mouthful. For me, the presentation was a bit much but the flavour was all there. The rich meaty marrow and sweet onions was served in the bone. I drunkenly said to the waiter as we chatted after the course that they were 'boney in the look' at which he broke into huge laughter and informed us that he'd once been dumped for much the same reasonahem. On to the mains. Well, we could't fit everything onto the table despite not ordering greens (shame on me). We went for the Porterhouse as I've never tried one, a T-Bone steak consisting of two cuts of beef, fillet (tenderloin) and shortloin. I also really wanted to get our waiter to cross our 900g portion off the chalk board which the team use to monitor how much of what is left. The simple things! The meat was heavenly. Smokey, tender, full of flavour and rich meaty juices. Sliced in the kitchen, there were a couple of bits that were a little bit overcooked, a shame when you pay such a premium, but overall it was fantastic. Alongside we chomped down on what are truly the kings of all chips, fried in beef dripping, crunchy, fat, fluffy and undeniably unhealthy, we dunked them into an order of the stilton hollandaise sauce which was tart yet deep and creamy, and we pretty much didn't speak until we were all done. Feeling very fat and very satisfied, what would any sensible couple do? Call it a night and make sure you catch the last tube home. But no, we had to have the sticky toffee pudding, and I'm so glad we did. Our waiter bought it over and gave us a tuneful and very happy",

    "text": "I went to Hawksmoor the week after it opened in Seven Dials, quite by co-incidence. The steak was absolutely first class and the service was top-notch. Friendly and informal, it was a superb experience. However, I've since been back and it's suffered a bit in its popularity. The meat is still very good, but not quite as good as it once was \u00a0you feel as though the busyness of the restaurant has affected the pride and quality that the chefs dedicate to the meat, which in all fairness, is still very good. The service is a little rushed, and the wine list has become (in my uneducated eyes) rather average. For a restaurant that has a wide range of wines, \u00a350 for a very basic Malbec is simply too much. As I've said, the atmosphere here is still good and the food is still very good \u00a0the fillets and sides especially \u00a0it still feels like a fairly special experience, but it's a lot less special than it once was.",

    "text": "The roast with the most From their first location in Spitalfields, Hawksmoor have peddled top-end steaks perfectly prepared, proving along the way that if you can do something perfectly you can charge as much as you want and people will pay. The first location's exposed brickwork and dark wood speak to the New York approach they take with their meat, a Smith and Wollensky come Quality Meats combination \u00a0and long a winning combination for them, albeit one in a slightly cramped East End location. The Seven Dials / Covent Garden location is new, but reminiscent of the first location, although a clear improvement upon it. Gone is the lack of space \u00a0from the start, the high-ceilinged entrance hall let's you know that you're in for something big. The staircase leading down into the restaurant is wide and gentle, setting your expectations for the proportions of the experience to come. The cocktail bar is a low-lit, high-stooled experience in anticipation. The cocktail list is substantial, inventive, and not as pricey as it could be. The cocktails themselves are everything they should be, entirely satisfactory, and a great match with the smells from the dining room proper and the dishes that whisk past on waiters' trays. The dining room itself is an old brewery, and exposed red brick, with a high arched brick ceiling, supported on massive iron pillars. Whilst entirely without windows, the indirect lighting is such that you couldn't care less. There are relatively few establishments where you don't feel like you're underground, or at least where you don't care a bit about it. This is definitely one exception. Our visit to Hawksmoor was for their highly affordable roast, but resisting ordering one of their fantastic steaks was an effort, as was resisting one of the many starters. How filling could half a dozen oysters be after all? Maybe we could share a small Chateaubriand on the side with our roast? And whilst we clearly couldn't, and would have made very little headway against it, I do wish we'd tried anyway. The roast itself arrived on a plate the size of a small table, with the single slice of meat itself taking up most of the plate. About as thick as a thumb, and as red as a slapped cheek, the meat was tender, juicy, and everything you'd hope from such beef experts as Hawksmoor. More impressive yet, the rest of the roast was as exceptional \u00a0the cabbage full-bodied, the Yorkshire pudding crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. The gravy was rich, whilst the carrots and roasted onion melted in the mouth. The unexpected roasted head of garlic was beautifully delicate in flavour. The only quibble I had was with the potatoes, an unfortunate combination of too tough on the inside and not crunchy enough on the outside \u00a0but even this was barely noticeable in the context. Hawksmoor has a fine selection of desserts, with more than a hint towards a boarding school inspiration \u00a0blancmange, ice-cream sundaes, toffee pudding, etc. Whilst the few we had were delicious, and there was a wide enough range of alternatives to appeal to most tastes, it is a rare slip of the veil of sophistication. The service was, with a few exceptions, ideal \u00a0at once relaxed and attentive. The beers \u00a0sourced from a few select micro-breweries \u00a0were full of flavour, and more than strong enough for the \u00a0pint glasses they were served in. The wine list was predictably extensive, and not something we even scratched the surface of. The after-dinner spirits were inventive, and as far as the rums went were a revelation. Best of all, for what is otherwise a high-end restaurant, the meal was surprisingly affordable. Highly recommended.",
