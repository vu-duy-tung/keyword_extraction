    "text": "Ever-expanding Mexican restaurants of London. I have a bone to pick with you. So for a long time I used to work more or less on top of the Daddy Donkey burrito van on Leather Lane market. They're widely regarded as the first and best burrito in London, and rightly so. Last night, I stumbled across Benito's, yet another burrito joint that have ripped off the Daddy D status quo wholesale, and wodged it into a trendy shop. Choose your filling. Choose your salsa. etc etc. Now strictly speaking, it was pretty good. I had the chicken burrito and it was absolutely fine. The problem I have is that there now seems to be a London subculture to Mexican food that is teetering away from their Californian roots. This bothers me. It's all gone a bit organic, white & green decor, shiny tabletop, overpriced 'tortilla chips' (no, they're not called nachos) and all-serve-the-same-kind-of-beer for me. So, Mexicali entrepreneurs who are looking at London. Listen up. What I want is: - cheap tacos- nachos with that goopy cheese sauce- lots of hot sauce choices- FISH for GOODNESS SAKE- don't overdo the decor Basically, a slightly less evil version of Taco Bell that serves real food. That's all I want. It's not much to ask.",

I love the place, in the back they have this huge photo of the green cabs \"bocho\" that we have in Mexico City! The burritos are really top notch; they are cheap and fresh as if my mom had picked the ingredients herself. It gets really hectic though; apparently I discovered the best burrito in town at the same time as half of London. Definitely a place to recommend and enjoy! Oh and please have a Pacifico, a really yummy beer that goes perfect with the food they serve here.",

Felt like I was in Mexico again! I had the Pork Burrito with Green Salsa, Guacamole, Cheese and Salad. It was spot on. The range of beers were good and love Modelo beer however it is not served in a lot of places. I did not try the Margarita or Nachos, had no space. Goodge St for sure is a hip area with a lot of food places and for value and service come here. Enjoy :-)",

    "text": "After googling 'good mexican food in London' a few weeks ago as to my horror I had found that Mexicali wasn't serving food in the evening I stumbled across some very lovely reviews of Benito's Hat. Considering it was only a stones throw away from where I was in Soho it was a quick skip and a jump up to Goodge Street. The food choice is fantastic, we didn't have to wait more than a minute or two to be served. It was quite busy (around 7pm) but we were lucky enough to get a table. And we were in and out in about 30 mins, which was perfect as we were hurrying off to see a film at Leicester Square. Would def go back because the food was awesome, there was a wide choice and it was really great value for money. They also serve my favourite Mexican beer - Negra Modelo which I fell in love with drinking at Cafe Pacifico. Can highly recommend this place for quick, yummy, in and out authentic Mexican food.",

As a hardened Qyper I hate to say this, but it's possible that this whole area has too many places to eat Anyway, Benito's Hat wasn't here yesterday. It is now and I'm very happy about it. Go in, choose what kind of mexican stuff you want (tacos, burritos etc) then you go up to the counter and watch as they throw all sorts of other mexican goodies in. Yum. The steak tacos I had were better than the pork one I swapped with my friend but both were really yummy. It was \u00a35 for three and well frankly that's a bargain. I wasn't a huge fan of the refried beans though as they were a bit bland, everything else was great though. They do fresh lemonade, which was a bit strong for my liking and was actually like a virgin margherita (they have a 2-4-1 deal on those at the moment by the way.) We came away full and happy. But just a quick note, in Sianyland tacos have hard shells, like tortilla chips. Here, they are soft like burritos. I can never find hard tacos in London. Can someone please enlighten me?",

(Try saying that ten times fast hehe) No really, I enjoyed my super-sized, had to hold with both hands, filled with guacamole, salad, chicken and a medium spicy sauce, burrito - it was definitely worth it's weight in pennies. They are served informally in a coloured basket, which also works as a hat so long as you haven't spilt half your burrito in there beforehand, or things could get sticky! The margaritas washed it down nicely, and the cinnnamon sticks with ice cream for dessert was a winner. The place itself has a friendly vibe, and the production line speeds up the burrito-making process. There isn't heaps of sitting room but we got the funkiest booth at the back :-)",

    "text": "Oiga amigos, Calimex street food has well and truly descended on Fitzrovia. But no this isn't the hood of a balmy Guadalajara suburb. By contrast, Benito's Hat is cushioned opposite a deluxe Habitat storefront in the culinary-rich area of W1. The happy arrival of this affordable, hearty eaterie comes off the trend of three burrito bars in the vicinity of Goodge St (the longstanding El Burrito restaurant and the excellent Freebird stall outside Oxfam, another off Exmouth Market (where there's also a second Freebird stall) and Mucho Mas on Upper Street, Islington. And it's a welcome cacophony of Latin spirit and sound, as a concoction of dipping starters appear in plastic postbox red baskets. We're ushered up to the front of the restaurant to grab our burrito (mine is of the beef variety), wrapped in silver foil and chomped hungrily as salty margaritas offset our tantalised taste buds. Diners are able to select a bespoke combination of marinated meats, vegetables, rice, beans, cheese and fresh salsas, all wrapped in a fresh warm tortilla or served over romaine lettuce. The meals come in at a student-friendly \u00a34 to \u00a36 which makes the venue a strong contender for the 'Cheap Eat of the Region' Award! Surrounded by the good company of Qypers nestled in the back corner of the restaurant, this provided the ideal spot for a friendly 'meat and greet' however it wouldn't get my vote for first date place. A dollop of guacamole on your lapel may not be the most enticing way to lure a potential amorado. Nonetheless, refreshingly crunchy cinnamon sticks with vanilla ice cream rounded off (quite literally) a Latin infused evening leaving me rather more rotund but quietly content.",

The concept is young and funny, ok, some of the waiters might be cute, ok, they play really good music (the Cure, Oasis, well at least what I'd call good music, defenitely for the young crowd, though; it's also quite loud, not a place for a romantic dinner for sure), ok, they have really friendly staff, ok, so everything pointing towards a 4-5 star rating. Still: the food was simply not good enough. We paid 15 pounds for 2 burritos, chips and a beer. That's good for London. But in that area Goodge/Charlotte street are a lot of eateries where you'd pay roughly the same, so this price seems to be normal and to be expected for the area. And still, to come back to the point the food simply wasn't great. It was filling, for sure, but the chicken, luke warm and stringy, not to my liking. The guacamole quite tasteless, but - here they get credit: they've used nice and ripe avocados. The salsa was good. But the beans, well I've had better ones, I found them a bit bland. Same was true for the vegetarion option burrito my friend tried. Good there were salt and pepper on the table. In conclusion, a place to get filling, rich food, but in terms of taste not my first choice. I'll continue looking for great Mexican food in London.",

    "text": "As a Californian and being a big fan of Mexican food, I found it a real struggle to find decent Mexican food when I moved to London 3 years ago. Just a few years ago, Mexican food meant Cooler Ranch Dorritos covered in wet Cheddar cheese and garbanzo bean burritos...it was just wrong....plain wrong. However, in the last year or so, the Brits have really come to grips with \"authentic\" Mexican food and I must say, i'm quite impressed. let's not kid ourselves...its nothing like the cuisine I get at home in LA, but it fills the void. \u00a0Benito's Hat is not the best of the bunch but it is a decent quick bite joint. Not too greasy, made with fresh ingredients and not a damn cooler ranch Dorrito in sight (fresh tortilla chips yes!). They even make fresh to order Margaritas (not out of those machines!) which are really tasty, albeit a bit on the small side. I do however have 2 major complaints with Benitos Hat. The first is that they don't have hot sauce on the table. Now, this might not be an issue for everyone, but mexican food is ALL about hot sauce for me...its like having a burger and chips without Ketchup...its just wrong. And their salsa wasn't amazing so they need to offer something. When I asked for hot sauce they said it would cost me extra...EXTRA...its bloody hot sauce. A chippy wouldn't charge you extra for mayonnaise now would it. \u00a0My advice to the owner would be to go out and buy a few bulk crates of Tapatio or Cholula to scatter around the joint. Ok, rant one over. The other issue I had is that they use white pepper in their cooking. I hate white pepper....it tastes like you're eating a barn. Literally, its like picking up a handful of dirty hay, wiping it on a horse and sticking it in your mouth. Good old fashioned black pepper does it for me. My Benito burrito did have a faint taste of this barn disaster which is why I can't give it high marks. \u00a0Overall its a decent burrito and if you're not as picky as me when it comes to condiments and seasonings, you might even enjoy it, but there are definitely better Mexican restaurants in the city.",

And for quite good reason. Their ingredients are consistently high-quality and tasty, and the staff seem to have a knack for getting just the right proportions. I'll often think about asking for a little more sour cream, but then trust their judgement, and realise that they know what they're doing. Even under the high pressure of lunch-rush, they consistently come up with the goods. Personal favourite's the chicken burrito, black beans, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and hot salsa. BAM! A taste explosion. There's a couple of decent beers on offer too, as well as various Mexican style drinks. I can't comment on the authenticity of the thing - having never visited Mexico - however Benito's Hat are consistently authentically tasty, and never so soggy that the bottom drops out of the thing before you've finished. The handful of tortilla chips is a nice touch, but probably unnecessary. The only way I'd make this place different would be to turn it back into a secret, so I don't have to queue up for their amazing bundles of awesomeness.",

    "text": "Benito's burritos are fantastic. I'm sure the rest of their meal choices are too, but that's what I went for - a chicken burrito with refried (baked) beans, rice, salad, cheese and a tomato and onion salsa. It all gets made up in front of you and packaged up into a foil wrap, put in a basket with a few tortilla chips and off you go. There's no waiter service but that was one of the things I loved about the place - you just choose what you want, pay and away - fast food but it's great quality. The staff almost guide you through your choices too, so if you feel a little nervous about selecting incongruous ingredients fear not! Don't let the sauce choices fool you either - there was a lack of spice in my chosen salsa (which is what I wanted) but the whole burrito was still full of flavour and textures. They're pretty big too, so will fill a hungry stomach up pretty nicely. As mentioned by other reviewers, the cinnamon crispy tortilla strips with ice cream were amazing, and well worth sampling even if you don't normally 'do' desserts. A nice smooth Mexican beer washed the lot down, along with a few Margaritas and Palomas. I have to be honest, I couldn't tell a great deal of difference between the two, but the Margarita maybe had the edge in strength. Palomas are essentially tequilla, lime juice, grapefruit juice and soda. Very nice, and it was great to be able to try something new and different from the usual choices found in the smaller restaurants and bars. From the outside it is minimalist and unassuming, but once you get inside there is a really good atmosphere, one that is clearly being shared by both punters and staff alike. The honcho, Ben, made sure we were happy throughout the evening and I applaud him for what he's achieved with Benito's Hat, it really is somewhere a bit different - equally suited to a quick but cool bite or a sit in with friends and drinks! I would definitely head back there when I'm in the area.",

There's a slight difference and I can't put my finger on it. (Spices, ingredients?) \u00a0Anyway, back to my point. It reminded me of Chipotle, but in that weird slightly off feeling. I had a chicken burrito with black beans, rice (got DAMN i love me some coriander and lime rice), cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. And I'll be damned if it weren't delicious!",

Pluses: The staff -- you always get service with a smile! The cheery atmosphere. Not getting charged for guacamole. And last but not least -- fresh ingredients.

Not to mention that the few times I have tried it at Camden or Spitalfields, it was decent at best in terms of taste, but not the closest thing to Mexican food or at least the Chipotle-style burritos I have a penchant for. The closest it came to was probably Chilango near Old Street.. but something was still not quite there.Benito's hat = UNNNNHHHHH. so good. hands down best Mexican place I've had in Europe. I think generally the quality of the food tastes a bit better than Chilango's, and it's a bit more of a small place, so it doesn't feel like a humongous 2-story chain like Chilango does. And for some reason, all the girls that work at Benito's are all really hot. The salad is AWESOME, the burrito is so good, and even the soup is great. \u00a0They have some amazing variety of sauces that you have to specifically ask for -- I don't even know what they are other than amazing. Benito's has made it possible for me to consider living in London permanently.",

I tried the tacos once and ended up wishing I had had the burrito, it's just not big enough and for just a bit more you get a burrito instead. Now the bad parts. The staff is a bit uneven, a lot of them leave and you might end up with one in training (not all bad, some new ones give you a lot more than they should!).

That said, for being a order-at-the-counter taqueria, I've had better and much cheaper, but then again, to compare the SF Mission district with Mexican in London is an unfair comparison. Definitely more Chipotle or Baja Fresh style...it works, but just ain't the same. My burrito maker, however, was ultra-generous with the helping of the tasty guacamolitoness on my pork burrito, so 5 stars to him. My boyfriend, on the other hand, got a rather skimpy helping of chicken on his, and cried a little because of it. I'm kidding, sort of.

Looking for cheap, Chipotle-style eats in London is almost as hard as beating Mike Tyson in NES Punchout. This place is truly a godsend. Being from California, there's nothing quite refried beans, meat, guac, rice, and floods of hot sauce to alleviate a hangover and this place certainly has all of the above. My personal choice was always the Benito's Hat equivalent of Chipotle's Burrito Bowl. Sour cream and guac? Yes, please.On a sidestreet of Tottenham Court Road that actually has quite a few good dining options, Benito's Hat is a great place to fulfill your greasy Mexican food deficiency. Really decent prices, absolutely worth it! Forget 'pub food', just go to Benito's. Your stomach and your wallet will thank you.",

Very fat. It also wasn't much to look at, being out of proportion in a Dannyesque way. Obviously I've never tasted Danny, and have no intention of doing so, but I imagine he'd be quite tasty in a greasy kind of way - much like my Benito's Hat burrito. Danny has had a place in my heart ever since he guest voiced in the Simpsons - I'm not sure Benito's Hat will have quite such an enduring appeal - but then again I've always had a soft spot for fat misshapen things.",

    "text": "The original and best in my humble opinion.Having seen a glut of burrito places explode around London in the past few years (c.f Mas Burritos, Tortilla, Chilangos) nobody wraps it like Benitos.It seems a little odd that many US-based Yelpers seem to enjoy comparing (unfavourably) these establishments to their own in SF, LA and NY, but the fact it is there are scarcely 5,000 Mexican nationals living in a city of 8+ million people... Those figures don't make for a promising Mexican food culture.So I think that Benitos Hat should be commended on their brick-sized burritos, filled with your choice of two types of slow-cooked, braised chicken, flavoursome pork, tender beef, and sometimes even fish (occasionally - which white fish though, I'm not sure! :S).Their guac is beautiful and always made with super-fresh avos (70p versus Chilangos - more miserly portions - at \u00a31), and they have a slew of themed nights (two-for-one tequila-based cocktails for students every week, specials on Cinco de Mayo etc).Being a regular at the Mortimer Street branch, I've yet to venture to either of their newer openings nearby, both of which I've been told cater to the lunchtime crowd more than the former, which has a more laid-back evening vibe about it with outdoor seating like its neighbours (Barrica, Salt Yard, The One Tun pub). This Fiztrovia branch however, is simply awesome - authentic or not.Go in, drop a tenner, enjoy yourself, and stagger back out sated, happy, and ready for a siesta...",

Perhaps it was I!Mission district burritos are alive and well, and exactly where I left them: in San Francisco. That's fine. That's where they belong. Meanwhile, some places in London are putting their own twists on this magical food, and sometimes it works out pretty well. Benito's Hat has flavors in their burritos that I wasn't accustomed to, but now that I'm accustomed to them, guess what- I like 'em just fine!Will I lust after them as I do burritos from home?

The meat selection/caliber is similar to Chipotle and so are the sauces.. the most notable difference was the rice, which is what I love most about Chipotle. The rice at Benito's hat felt much dryer and plain and not cilantro-y enough (or at all?). They did make up for it a bit later though cause they have a \"cilantro only\" option they scoop in after the lettuce, tomatoes, and salsa. If you're a fan of barbacoa at Chipotle, you'll like the braised pork option at Benito's hat.If I'm ever given a choice, I'd always pick Chipotle unless I was already in front of Benito's and too lazy to move.

    "text": "So when you do a really big poo, one that's been filling you up and making you sluggish and heavy for hours, doesn't it feel great to get it out? Sure - it's a little gross and as the poo leaves it can sometimes be a little painful too, but don't deny how satisfying it feels.A friday night pork burrito with the habanero sauce from Benito's Hat is almost the perfect opposite of this. It was a little gross and spicy painful as I ate it and it made me horribly sluggish and heavy for hours afterwards but there was no denying how satisfied I felt. A \u00a35.50 taco-wrapped reverse mega-poo!In terms of the burrito itself I was mighty impressed with the pork meat, the taco and the spiciest sauce but the too much and too-dry rice negated the fifth star. I'll be back though - a chunky burrito like this is always good fast food, it's practically ready to leave your body before it goes in. Huzzah for cylindrical dinners!",

This is not a complete restaurant but an extremely pleasant fast food joint with the nicest staff it has been my pleasure to order from. The menu is limited to burritos, tacos and salads so not a full menu by any standards. The Burritos are excellent, and as good as, if not better than many I have had in the US. The prices are reasonable ane especially for the size of the burrito, The ingredients were very fresh and the guacamole was especially good.The Margarita I had was nicely put together but small and wasn't one of the better ones I have had and I am a fan of the Margarita. The staff are cheerful, pleasant, helpful and efficient and make you feel very welcome. It's a pleasant experience to eat there and the food is very good if somewhat limited in scope. Well worth a visit and especially if you are hungry",

It was huge, quite enough food for two meals (or one very long sitting). I also had a Ting, a grapefruit flavoured fizzy drink that accompanied my burrito nicely.

It may be small, and you may have to sit closer to strangers than you like - but the food is worth it. For \u00a34 - \u00a35 you can eat a massive burrito stuffed with everything from steak to chicken or chargrilled veggies, topped with cheese, sour cream, salsa, or delicious guacamole. They have tons of options for what you can put in your burrito/taco/salad. A bit reminiscent of Baja Fresh, but with less saturated fat and more authenticity, the good folks a Benito's Hat make your dinner right before your eyes. Like magic. They also have margaritas and Mexican beers, which is always a win in my book.If you're craving killer Mexican food, don't go here as you'll be disappointed. (Especially if you're from California. Or, er, Mexico.) But it's still delicious food and the staff are super friendly.",

I choose a burrito filled with black beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, lettuce and mild salsa.The staff is friendly and attentive. If you are confused by the various spiciness of each salsa, do not hesitate to inquire. Ask for Lara, Raliza or for Spanish speakers Abraham. Benito's Hat offers a simple concept with extraordinary taste and for just 20 minutes and around 5 pounds, I am able to exchange the hectic streets of London, for the sand, sun and flavour of Baja!",

I stopped and asked if they would serve me, and although they were closing up for the evening they whipped up some tacos for me which tasted sublime. I now work within lunchtime proximity of Benito's Hat, and worry that one day my office will move too far away to come here regularly. I eat here at least once a week. The prices are excellent, the fillings are top quality and there's a giant poster of Mexican VW Beetle taxis on the wall! What more could I possibly ask for? I could ask for Agua de Jamaica, but they have that too :) (For those who don't know, Agua de Jamaica is Hibiscus water. It tastes a bit like cranberry juice but is much nicer). I love Mexican food, and burritos in particular. Benito's hat is sited in an area of high burrito density, and the only reason for not going here is that the queue is too long, which says it all really. Benito's Hat serve the best burritos I've had in London, and I've had a lot of burritos. They also do cocktails and desserts, so you don't have to restrict it to lunchtime only :)",

We arrived to a welcoming collection of chicas del Mexicana bopping and chatting over some dance music. It felt very fiesta like. The music level was reduced as we were guided through the choices of their superb Fresh Mex style cuisine. The soup sounded auth\u00e9ntico but it's hard not to grab a steak/pork/chicken/veg burrito when they look so good. The friendly service, good vibe and excellent fresh wholesome food makes Benito's Hat a great filling lunch choice. There is complimentary water jugs too if you over-spice your taco so you can extinguish the burn. The venue also makes a quick evening meal to be accompanied with some fine cervezas del Mexico. Se\u00f1or Benito. I doff my Hat to you.",

The choices are largely the same but the staff seem a bit more purposefully outgoing which can either be fun or if you're hangry, just a hurdle you have to cross to get to eating.

I get quite pissy when burrito places barely put any rice and beans. Imagine my delight here. I got TWO types of beans (real f'n refried beans), a healthy dose of rice and sauteed (not grilled-to-hell) FLAVOURFUL veggies. I was told guacamole was free on veggie burritos; add salsa, and a nice lightly spicy sauce... I had a stuffed-to-the-gills* burrito baby looking at me.+ Two: TORTILLA CHIPS! THEY COME WITH THE BURRITO! I was so pleased to see this! I love soft tortilla intermissions with crunchy chips. Best idea ever.+Three: WTF- the service? AMAZING. Sorry London, but your customer service is atrocious. Every person at Benito's Hat (Goodge St) working the line, the till, the bussers- smiling and making sure you're having a lovely time. Such a nice vibe.Others: I was genuinely shocked how good my first bite was. The are many hot sauces to choose from. There are evening Mexican sharing platters. Happy hour is 5-7.Benito's Hat KNOWS there are many burrito bars, but they make the effort to do it better and it pays off big time. As the person at the next table said, \"I love this place.

I never get beans so why can't they be nice and give me what I want! more cheese, it was a very light dusting of cheese! what is that! I can't even see the cheese they sprinkled on, it was that light! in the UK they just stuff burritos full of the cheap fillings (i.e. lettuce and rice) and skimp on the good stuff! meat and cheese! I also don't see why pork and chicken are cheaper the beef?I miss California where we have free all you can eat salsa bars with chips in our taco shops!!! its only salsa! these people need to calm down and stop being greedy!

    "text": "I'd like to preface this review by stating that I'm from the SF Bay Area, so you may detect a bit of CA. snobbery here. :SLet's start with the best things about this place: the horchata was super tasty, and the puerco was succulent and flavorful.The bad bits: two tacos are in the neighborhood of 4.40. \u00a0You can't have just one if you're not that hungry. \u00a0However, you can stuff yourself with three, if you're so inclined. \u00a0I wouldn't normally call the above info. 'bad bits' save for the fact that the amount of pork for each taco was about a tablespoon's worth. \u00a0I thought that the three toppings per taco would round out the plate somewhat, but the amounts of lettuce and tomato added were equally anemic. \u00a0I think that I was so underwhelmed by the building of the taco that I didn't see that the dude helping me had used flour tortillas. \u00a0Flour tortillas for tacos=muy malo. \u00a0To further obscure my view of the food, corn chips were sprinkled over the open-faced tacos, so, only by the time I'd sat down, had I realized what I'd been given. \u00a0Nowhere on the menu does it state--please correct me if I'm wrong--that there's a choice of either corn or flour tortillas. \u00a0The dude helping me certainly didn't ask what I wanted. \u00a0I certainly didn't ask for something that I didn't think was on the menu. \u00a0Well, not again, as I'd already asked if they'd serve me only one taco, and that was met with a resounding 'no' from two different employees. \u00a0My lunch date wasn't keen on tacos with flour tortillas or otherwise, and went up to the counter after me to order a pretty righteous burrito with both pork and veggies. \u00a0While ordering, she found out that BH did indeed carry corn tortillas.After I'd eaten, I went in to substantiate her claim. \u00a0The guy behind the counter said, yes, they have corn tortillas, and that I should have asked for them if I'd wanted them. \u00a0Hmmmmm. \u00a0Shouldn't they be offering them? \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0Apparently, if corn tortillas aren't asked for, then the default tortilla used for tacos is flour. \u00a0Other points: the guac tasted of refrigerator, or something, however, it looked like it would taste really good. \u00a0We found out that they don't use citrus in their recipe, and that they use spring onions instead of red onions, so, perhaps, that could also account for the flavor differences between BH guac and guac from back home. \u00a0Also, in terms of spice, their 'medium' salsa would be considered 'mild' in CA.The moral of this rather tired story is: ask for what you want even if you think that the answer will be 'no'. :)",

It's like Subway, but for burritos. (To be fair they also have tacos, or if you want to try to be healthy, a salad, which is a burrito without the rice. However once you cover it with cheese, sour cream and guacamole, it's probably not really healthy at all.)It's a pretty common business strategy. You can find the same thing under different names anywhere you go in London these days. And it's perfectly reasonable. It's not amazing. It's not terrible. It's average. But it's quick so if you want a bit of lunch it's not a bad place to go.They do get a slight bonus for having horchata. So far it's one of two places I've been in London that have it. They also have several levels of hot salsa you can add. The hottest one is pretty spicy. So that's a bonus as well, as I like it spicy.",

But I'm open to trying new things in a new town, so why the hell not?Judging by the line out of the door during lunch hour, I presumed it was a hot spot if people are willing to line up out the door right? Well no, it's just a huge commercial hype. I thought well it looks just like a Chipotle chain in disguise, it's probably just fresh-mex so I'm not expecting close to authentic at this point from the looks of the restaurant's exterior. I ordered the steak burrito with black beans, lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo, onions, cilantro and salsa verde. Sounds like a basic enough combo right? Their ingredients were way under par and was very unflavorful (which isn't even a word!) Nothing special and I regretted paying \u00a36 for such a weak burrito. Tried to imagine that hey this place is good enough for Mexican food in London, at least....but that image soon disappeared when I realized that even Chipotle is better than this place. I'll pass.",

I ordered a \"salad\" which was actually a \"naked burrito\" for those who know Chipotle well, which was kind of a bummer bc i wanted it to be healthy and was staying away from Carbs...but oh well.. she tried to discourage me from getting the grilled chicken bc the braised chicken is so much tastier but fattier and of course i went for the healthier option, which im actually happy about. \u00a0Their hot sauce, though not super mexican tasting, was super spicy. \u00a0and this is coming from an indian girl used to a high degree of spice! Hubby had the burrito with braised chicken and he was quite happy with his purchase. \u00a0The boy literally scarfed it down in 2 mins! \u00a0im all about happy hour so next time i do come in, i will need to take advantage of the two for one drinks.",

Arriba ARRIBA AY AY AY! Sorry, i got away from myself a bit. Back to the food. I went there with fellow yelper Bea B. for a chance to taste home. What we got was some whack food. Bea went up to grab some tacos while i held down the fort out front (patio seating= 1 star). She comes back with tiny tacos with nothing on them barely and not happy that they didn't have corn tortillas for tacos. So went I went in I looked on the board and saw no mention of tortillas flour or otherwise. So i asked the guy if they had some corn tortillas and he said ONLY for tacos. And i thought that was weird because why would they give Bea flour. Bizarre. Anyway, I ordered a burrito because the tacos were too complicated. I Ordered the pork burrito with everything, even asking for extra vegetables that I saw lingering around. I didn't like that they automatically put rice in my burrito but whatevers, I can be flexible. I had a side of chips that were not stale at all, I actually liked them a ton and since the chips were good I grabbed a side of what I thought was quac. It was made of avocados but it was NOT guacamole. I actually got the waiter to give me the recipe and it was lacking in the acidity of lemon and the heat of jalape\u00f1o's. No thanks. I really tried to eat it. But i just couldn't. It was really gross. But the burrito was decent and rolled nicely and the Horchata was ok. As much as I really liked the outdoor patio and the service I don't think I will ever go to this place again.",

What to expect: You can order a burrito, burrito bowl, or naked bowl (which is a burrito bowl with extra lettuce).

Staff are fast. \u00a0I also tried the classic magararita, which was delicious. Burritos come with a fistful of tortilla chips. The burrito itself was insipid. I was expecting some flavour from the slow cooked saucy beef or the beans, or the buttery feedback from the guac. It just flatlined. I could taste the rice, and I wound up with a mouthful of the hot sauce at the bottom. It was hot to be sure but there was no nuance in the sauce. Utterly forgettable.Your mileage may vary but there are so many options in the area, I think I'll dine elsewhere.",

This one stands out, originally because of it's silly name and then very quickly because of the Burritos. It's no real looker, there's no atmosphere worth the mention but the fact that the place doesn't have that and still receives 4 stars? It's because they mean business. With almost clinical precision the staff can build a burrito the size of your head and they'll still throw some nachos on the side. Choose from a selection of contents like a variety of meat and an array of salad it's a little like a Mex Subway without the unlimited refills and the faint stink of health propaganda. The lack of bottomless soft drinks is nothing to worry about either, no, for unlike subway this groundbreaker of an establishment serves bottled beer! Including Negra Modelo! Seriously there's no better compliment to a Burrito than a nice cold Modelo, except, perhaps, Benito's very own hat - - Not on the menu as of yet.",

Spend 3 minutes trying to figure out how to eat this sucker. Being a lady, I decided to go for a knife and fork. Bad choice but it was done.

Ok, I know it was just grilled veg but you'd think with all the other crap in there, it'd actually taste like something.There's no reason I'd ever go back here.

For me, Benito's Hat is the best cheap and cheerful Mexican fix in the capital (for classic plated Mexican my pick would be either Mestizo or Green & Red). I have been to the Hat several times and found each of the burritos I've tried pretty incredible: mouthwateringly tender pork, flavourful chicken (I've never found it stringy) and lovely chunks of meaty steak. Delicious. The black beans are as good as any I have sampled in Mexico or the States and the salsas perfection. The salsa verde is my favourite, but the salsa brava will blow your socks off. The margaritas have that fresh zingy simplicity and kick I am looking for - some of the only ones I've found in London which are not made from a mix. The service is always warm and friendly and on the occasions when I have had to wait, the queue has moved pretty quickly. I love the music and the vibe. Need I say more? Viva la Hat!",

It's quite simple here - you ask for a burrito, tacos or a salad and then choose a filling (beef, 2 kinds of chicken, pork or roasted veggies) and a bunch of toppings. I went with the pork along with black beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa verde and guacamole. This place does the most generous serving of guacamole I have ever seen! It's wrapped up in foil (I approve of this method as it makes it so much easier to eat) and then served in a basket with tortilla chips (which were nicely salted).",

    "text": "I came here after reading the menu online which made my mouth water and was really unimpressed. Im sure the meat tastes great but I h\\d the veggie option which consisted of really large chunks of big vegetables (not in easy to eat bits or strips) in a v bland sauce. I was sorely dissapointed. The guacamole said it had a hint of tomato, when it had massive great chunks of tomato (I HATE tomato!). I did like the free nachos and tap water, Ive been to California extensively and that was really authentic. Perhaps if the veggies were marinated in the tasty sauces of the meat (i.e highly spiced and saucy) then it wouldnt taste so bland.",

    "text": "The burritos are so good here that my husband ate lunch AND dinner here last weekend...and I was so jealous. My favorite is a burrito with a mix of refried and black beans, rice, veggies, pico di gallo, lettuce, guacomole, onions and cilantro, and the spicy salsa. When I'm not super hungry, but want my Mexican fix, I go for 2 tacos with beans and rice and the proper toppings. Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is better than what I've received at much more expensive places. 5 stars aren't enough! Highly recommended.",
