I might also add that the serving of pitta bread was far too small. bit cheap on that front. decor wise its pretty basic, in fact why don't they put some more plants and colour into it like the washroom area? because there is no space!i've sounded pretty negative but we did really enjoy it. i suppose we just expected a bit more. def worth trying out.",

    "text": "DING DING DING DING.That's the bell sounding.That's the sound of excitement.The sound of discovery.The sound of London.That's the sound of another great place to eat, with authentic ethnic food, in unpretentious surroundings.Me and the missus met for lunch in a place equidistant from my work and hers. Warren St was that place. My old stomping ground, but how many of the good old places were still there? Not many. But the missus had read about this place and with us both liking a bit of middle eastern we gave it a bash.Small room. Tables so close that essentially you're sharing. noise bounces off the bare walls and floors making it almost uncomfortably loud. But there's a good buzz emanating from the place and some good smells emanating from the kitchen downstairs. So we wait patiently and are soon rewarded with a tiny table for two.Busy waitress recommends the mezze to share to start. She sits down for a sec to impart the information with a wink. Formal it ain't. We see that next door has ordered the same (not hard, it's so close you could practically sniff it to your side of the table) and it looks bloody delicious, so we go for it.What comes are some truly delightful small plates. Carrot rounds marinated in vinegar and cumin. Deep fried cubes of cheese are perfect. A nicely balanced chick pea salad. baba ganoush that tasted of the grill. Proper olives. Freshly done pitta bread which we simply had to have more of. I don't think they charged us for our greed either. What a start. This food is cooked not just with skill, but with love. That you could tell. It couldn't get better could it?I ordered chicken dumplings in broth as a main and the missus ordered the hummus topped with ground meat.What arrived was just a delight. The chicken dumplings were sitting in a light clear broth which smelled like only a carefully made, home cooked broth could. And floating on top were some beautiful flowers and green leaves which not only looked wonderfully pretty but tasted damn good to. The whole thing was a picture. A winning spring dish if ever I've had one. I would describe it as memorable, I really would. The hummus was creamy and the minced lamb on top nicely spiced with the usual cinnamon and things and lots of deep red oil to raise the cholesterol and the enjoyment. Not memorable in the way the chicken dumplings were, but totally moreish and satisfying. We wiped each plate clean with the pitta bread that came with the hummus until the plates were ready for the next customers. The two of us shouted our appreciation to the ever so friendly waitress as the noise levels rose still further with happy eaters blasting away in this great place.We walked out with the flavours still dancing away in our mouths. Sorry to be crude but I can't find a better way to say it. This place doesn't fuck around. You come in, you eat proper street food from half way round the world, you leave with your belly full and your wallet only a little lighter. As I wandered back to work I was reminded one again why London is the greatest city in the world.",

I arrived on a Tuesday evening with a friend to catch up over a meal, we arrived and were told that we would have to wait. The room was very cramped for a restaurant. We waited outside and for 5-10 minutes when we were told that there were no spaces. As we left we saw a couple leaving, so we asked whether we could have their seats after them, the staff member said yes. So we waited longer. As we finally went to sit down we were asked whether we wanted to order all 3 courses. After saying that we were only planning on one or two courses \u00a0we were rudely told(not asked) to leave to make room for other guests. There were no other guests arriving, nor anyone waiting. I'm not sure what we did to deserve such abhorrent treatment but we certainly won't be going back to find out, nor to find out what their food is actually like, although I have heard good things! Possibly one for the foodies, but not those who wish to have a pleasant dining experience with kindly members of staff.",

    "text": "Small, friendly, almost neighbourhood restaurant, and it's excellent. Really, quite excellent. I've been twice now, it's great to go with friends - excellent atmosphere, and had an early dinner both times. The mezze platter is the way to go, and it changes seasonally, as it should! As of last weekend there is a wonderful feta and watermelon combination! Wine list is simple and solid, the house white pairs well with most everything, though I couldn't help thinking how great a cold/salty/petrol-ly retsina would be too. There's a fantastic chilled red desert wine that's well worth trying if you get round to it! The mains rotate with seasons - I had an exceptionally tender grilled ox tongue back in May, which was sadly not there when i returned, but there's a solid shawarma, and grilled pomegranate molasses chicken that turned out to be rather great alternatives. They're not the biggest mains, but after grazing on the mezze with lots of time for idle banter, you'll be sufficiently suffonsified... But don't let that stop you trying the desserts - the standout among them is the cold cheesecake. A not too sweet, not too rich, and (probably) ricotta based dessert with a fried Kadalf pastry (think crispy baklava) base covered with honey and pistachios. A wonderful way to finish the meal. It's in a quiet location, on a part of Warren street not really near too much else. I would book, and then eagerly wait in anticipation of a great meal. Go with friends, you won't be disappointed.",

The girls serving were all really good and friendly, \u00a0the food came out well and they managed to make sure that every one got their pre-ordered meal! Drinks were kept well topped up through out the night.The food was all good a selection of starters to share that included bread with oil, falafels, pickled carrot (my favourite), melon and feta, aubergines and humus to name a few. A small criticism might be that there was actually too many starters as I strugged to get through my whole main (dont normally complain about too much food but felt it just ruined my main that I would have liked to have finished)I had the lamb Shawarma, \u00a0can't remember if I have had this meal anywhere else but it was good!! Well seasoned and a decent portion (if I had less starters!) Of the other 4 mains on offer one other was lamb and there was a fish dish and a beef selection. \u00a0All were well received although I heard mixed reviews on the fish. I managed to get a few mouthfuls of the beef which was good but would have seen me a little bit bored of eating the same thing if I had chosen it.So it all seems good! ! Why not 4 *??? Just a few minor things: The AC was broken and packed out the place got very warm. There is only one shared toilet which with 25 people sharing it required some strategic planning to not end up quing for too long. Lastly you can see into the kitchen from the bathroom area, its not unhygienic and I appreciate its a working kitchen but I would have liked to seen it a bit cleaner and tidy.It seemed a litrle pricey but we did a split bill and I cant be sure that bsome people ordered more drinks, \u00a0so I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area.",

Started the lunch with a plum juice, which was very refreshing. For starters, I ordered the chicken liver baklava with grape molasses. Quite an innovative mix of a pate-type paste with the sweetness of the baklava. My initial surprise of the amalgamation of flavours, gave way for an excessive sweetness in my mouth and I had leave the dish midway. My girlfriend ordered the Jerusalem-styled falafel, which was quite average; a surprise as you'd expect Honey & Co. to get the basics right. For the main course, I ordered the Mushahan, which is a slow-cooked chicken baked on flat bread. This was the saving grace for the lunch as the pomegranate and currants really added an interesting twist to it.I won't be going back in a hurry but go there for an exotic take on traditional dishes and great service.",

It was delicious. The best value meal would be to opt for the set menu, although we didn't go that route sharing a starter, 2 mains and a dessert. The hands down favourite of the evening was the brisket dumpling main course. I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was a sort of salt beef ravioli if you will, in a creamy sauce with currents. Whatever it was, it was absolutely delicious - amazing, well balanced and scrummy, unique flavours.As well as delicious food, the staff were also really helpful. I felt I was at really friendly family owned restaurant, and I can't wait to come back and try breakfast.Decor wise, it's quite small and simple - more of a cafe. The emphasis is on the food and service, rather than style. \u00a0Tables are tightly packed next to other tables. \u00a0It was a little bit difficult to get into my seat as it's quite crammed at dinner time - \u00a0so do book. They offer you either the 6pm or 8pm sitting, as it's quite a cosy restaurant and they've limited capacity. \u00a0I have to admit, dinner service prices are a bit high for a cafe experience but if you love Middle Eastern flavours definitely worth checking it out.",

I have been there twice since then.It was started by a few former Ottolenghi chefs, who have brought a similar taste and trendiness to Warren Street. The food is light and healthy with an emphasis on vegetables, and often with a delightful splash of yogurt or feta. The violet aubergine bourek was awesome, as was the special lamb shwarma with pomegranate seeds. The waitstaff are very friendly and accommodating.Ask for their iced tea of the day - so far have had orange+orange blossom and plum, rose+violet. Would go back in a heartbeat. However, it's very small and only open for lunch so you need a reservation if you're coming at rush hour.UPDATE: It's now open for dinner, but you still need a reservation as it's EXTREMELY popular!",

The very small Middle Eastern-cafe is very crowded, seating is uncomfortably tight, and the decor is simplistic. \u00a0Initially, the only table that was available was outside in the cold and darkness. Fortunately, inside seating became available but it so cozy that you can almost read your neighbor's texts. The service was initially welcoming. The walls are stacked with jams, chutneys, coffee, cookbooks, and rose water. The back counter had a delicious presentation of desserts. I ordered the \"Winter Set\" mezze which was fresh, colorful, \u00a0and fabulous. I had sliced cinnamon falafel with tahini; creamy hummus; creamy saffron pears with walnuts; aubergene bourrkka; minted courgette with yogurt; hot tomatoes; pickles & kalamata olives; a sampling of home-made breads and olive oil. My main entree was the Madfunia which was a slow-cooked Chicken with chestnuts, golden raisins, and topped with a crisp Kadhafi crust. After my third piece of bone in my chicken, I was finished. My neighbors and I waited forever for our checks and to leave. I loved the appetizers and I was genuinely enjoying my meal and the restaurant. \u00a0I, however, was disappointed with the quality of my entree. The lack of service at the end of my meal and the lack of space took my score from a four-star to a three-star rating. They also have Honey & Spice, a food store, a few doors down the street. honeyandco.co.uk",

Since its opening a few years ago, Honey and Co has followed Ottolenghi's tradition of modern middle eastern fare in a less opulent manner. You get the sense that everything here came from someone's kitchen, the product of love and family, designed to show off the best of its ingredients, rather than overwhelm with complexity or pretension. Freshly baked counter pastries and cakes are usually dripping with honey, rose or pistachios. Savory meguese sausages and baked eggs are accompanied by home-made harissa (slightly sweat inducing, salty and lime-noted, as it should be). The service is always friendly and loyal locals mingle with far-flung foodies like me. If you succumb to one of their cookbooks, the good news is that their recipes travel well and deliver a result (almost) as good as the originals you will find when you (inevitably) return. Sweet!",

For a starter, I got a tomato and aubergine salad, which was quite refreshing and came with a yogurt type of sauce. Then as a main, I got grilled sea bream, which was served with vegetables and beans, kinda the type that you would eat as a seafood lunch at a beach town, except that we were really indoors in a Mediterranean restaurant in London. It was apparently new on the menu, but very high quality food.However, the settings were a bit less than ideal... I booked ahead of time by emailing the restaurant, and they responded promptly and I got the reservation without a problem. Btu the restaurant is really cramped and I was with a guy that was 6'4\" and he was clearly uncomfortable with the lack of leg room at a 2-person table. It was also necessary to move tables just so that I could get into my seat, to give you an idea of how little room there is. So definitely keep that in mind... would be very difficult to come in big groups and with anyone that is not a very good friend or family!",

Our server was delightful! He was knowledgeable, attentive and entertaining :) we had such a lovely time. The cheese cake dessert was said to be the 4th best dish in London and probably my life. It was sweet, salty, creamy and crunchy; topped with almonds and blueberries.

    "text": "Top-notch middle-east cuisine!!! I had great expectations about this place, and definitely it was worth to try their food. I tried a kind of marinated beef that was outstanding, the lamb chops and falafel (superb!). Of course, I also tried an outstanding desert! The food was excellent. Perfectly cooked! But there were a couple of things that I want to point out (and hopefully it will be help for the owner/manager/staff). First, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked. However, the meat was a little bit hard. In other words, the lamb was not tender enough. I am not saying it was bad lamb or that it was super hard. I just was expecting it to be more tender. Second, I truly appreciate that the staff was very nice, smiling all the time and super friendly. However, I tried to call their attention twice, and I took me a while, since the waitresses were chatting with some friends, or talking among themselves (for instance, I was holding a plate for a while waiting for someone to take it; note that the tables are tiny, so an extra plate on the table is a pain in the back). Again, they were friendly and helpful, but I think they should keep an eye on customers first. Overall, excellent experience. By they way, the decoration is beautiful! Regarding prices: not cheap, but not crazy expensive.",

I was seated at the bar/window, which was lucky considering I didn't have a reservation. I am a small person and yet I felt like an elephant in a china shop in that place. They really shouldn't cram that many tables in that small space. It took a while for my order to be placed considering the restaurant was not full yet. I ordered the lemonade (seriously good) and the chicken dish that reminded me of an empanada. The food was delicious and the low rating isn't for the food. After my meal was delivered, no one came to check if everything was ok, I would have loved to have ordered another lemonade. I had to ask for the check and to see the dessert menu. In the end I decided to take the dessert to go ... because I probably would have waited forever for it to be delivered (which is a shame, because I really wanted to try the cheesecake confection ). My bill was brought and after waiting quite a bit of time I had to go the counter in order to get change. I'm not a picky/particular person, but it's not an inexpensive place. For those prices, I shouldn't have to be chasing you down and made to feel like I was an afterthought or an inconvenience. The food was delicious though.",

I didn't expect it to be so busy on a Friday mid-afternoon, but the wait was over 45 minutes and we elected to eat outside. I had the BBQ aubergine, which exceeded all expectations. It had some sort of tahini filling that was positively luscious, all nicely complemented by the jeweled rice salad. My dining companion had the Patlican, which she also loved. The only disappointment was the coffee, but that can be forgiven. Catching a chill outside was totally worth it for this amazing food.",

You can tell that so much care goes into making the food. Not only does it look beautiful but it tastes amazing. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes.

With the same sharing platter comes 2 types of egg dishes for each (with bread and labneh on the side again) for which we ordered green shakshuka (amazing) and the egg plant/tahini dish on a pita bread that literally melts in your mouth.

Just this morning I paid Honey & Co a visit and I was - as usual - greeted with a bright smile by Rachel: \"Hi Uli! How are you?\" Now, this is what I call amazing atmosphere and great \"customer retention\": there's only a handful shops in London, where people greet me with my name...but this is he most important reason for me to come back. Now, as I mentioned above, the food here at Honey & Co is also fantastic and I've yet have to eat something I didn't like. This morning, for example, I ate a lahme (some kind of Israeli breakfast pizza) accompanied by cardamom coffee. None of these I picked myself, but were recommended to me by Rachel: I simply don't like making decisions, so I am always happy for suggestions. All in all: both thumbs up! I love coming here!Note: it's almost impossible to make spontaneous dinner reservations and also the lunch spots are filling up way too quickly these days. I highly recommend swinging by for a delicious breakfast, though, as it is still quite peaceful and you will be able to read a newspaper or engage in a little chitchat with the staff.",

Other reviews have called it unpretentious and, at the risk of repetition: it's a lovely little unpretentious spot.A lovely little unpretentious spot *serving up high levels of deliciousness*.I've never been her for dinner, so can't comment on the larger mains. More typical for me is a pop-by on Warren Street to pick up a baked good or 3. The chocolatey rich babka, sweet and yeasty. The orange blossom honey cake. The chock-full-of-poppy seed loaf. The cold cheesecake which is the much-talked-about dessert with delicious, deserved reason.Yesterday I stopped in for the most perfect little strawberry financier: made from almond meal and a tiny little spot of strawberry jam, and sporting a perfect berry hat...this was a winner, and a reminder that I'm still (deludedly!) clinging to summer. The space is small, but that adds to the warm vibe.Staff wonderful, limited - but excellent - range of options for breakfast and lunch (as mentioned: have not been here for dinner). Fresh juices. Friendly vibe. Yes, yes yes.Yelp note: Honey & Co cookbook on sale, too! As well as a shelf right when you come in with some preserves and granola and other things if you want to bring Honey & Co home with you...",

Thankfully, they were ready for us!The set dinner menu (\u00a326.5/per person) took the guesswork out of our evening meal. It's a great way to go if you've got a group. You'll get a selection of bread with olive oil, homemade pickles and kalamata olives and a bunch of mezzes to shares like hot tomatoes with Manouri cheese and mint, hummus, falafel, lebeneh and watermelon and feta salad. And then everyone gets to pick their own main. I'd definitely recommend the lamb shawarma as a main. The meat was crazy tender and I enjoyed the elevated and deconstructed presentation (lamb in its own little pot with plenty of yogurt and pomegranate seeds on top, toasted pita in the middle, cabbage and tomates in a small bowl on the other side). And I wasn't the only one who enjoyed it, my colleagues enthusiastically dug into my plate too!If you're in the mood for a fresh take on food from the Middle East, you can't go wrong at homey Honey & Co.!",

I do agree with the other reviews in that they could serve a little more pitta bread.2. Mains- lamb tagine was not bad, just okay. I have made this at home and found that it was lacking the contrast of flavor some hopes to find in middle eastern good (slightly bland). My partner had the chicken shish- the chicken was cooked very well and was very good. The whole dish was great.3. Dessert- DON'T SKIP THIS! We had the walnut coffee cake and the plum coconut and almond. They were both deliciously perfect! 4. Service was fantastic! No complaints at all! **i don't think I would come back to have the full meal. This place is a one and done for me, however if I was in the area I would definitely come back for coffee and cake**",

    "text": "Ok, I admit. If I am welcomed at a venue by a BIG BIG smile of a staff it biases me towards a 5 star review really easily. But man... Honey & Co. made me rethink what I call a big smile!However, to the point - you can't go wrong with this place. It was FULLY booked 2 weeks ahead when me and my friends visited it. The only way to taste their food was to sit outside which we eagerly did. And I would do so again even during a winter of the century!Not being very hungry (and frankly - on a budget after 2 days in London) we did not go with an excellent \u00a326/p.p. option of \"a little bit of this, a little bit of that\" which allows you to get some of all of their starters for share AND a main course for everybody.We (4 guys) settled on getting figs and falafel for starters and quails (x2), lamb meatballs and a chicken wrap with pomegranate.Oh yeah, when we were still trying to figure out what to order - a man walked out of the venue so we asked him about a recommendation. 'Everything is excellent.' was his response.You can imagine that we waited anxiously after such promise. Fortunately, this was not one of the \"some that he's broken\" (thank you Mr. Sting) and soon we were served meals that I would call exceptional. They were simple. They were not \"overdone\". They were just perfectly fitting this little, cosy spot.Writing about taste is like dancing about architecture (thank you Mr. Zappa) so try it for yourself, you won't regret it. And thanks to the owner (?), a heart-warming lady, I felt like the most important guest in their restaurant when talking to her.Well, if it's a job of a restaurant to amaze me - they've done it. Thank you, if I'm ever back in London, I'll visit you Honey & Co.P.S. You could have chosen a better beer for you offer though. :)",

I walked in with a friend for lunch - the tables are few and the space even less. We had booked lunch and we were sat down promptly. That was nice - I think it ended there. The menu didn't have much choice which can be both good and bad. I ordered the slow cooked lamb and my friend the aubergine dish from the mains. The environment was quite claustrophobic inside and I think we were both feeling a little nauseous with the variety of smells. Nothing really middle eastern about that. Having grown up in the Middle East I was excited to try the dishes. But they were most un-middle eastern like. The aubergine dish was bland as. It had a thick tahini crust which was curious but the dish lacked in flavour and wasn't appealing at all. The lamb came in a bowl - it had some sweet boiled plums inside with barberries. It was too sweet and very lamby. From memory the lamb I had growing up tend to be more dry and spiced not wet and sweet. Well at least the hummus and bread was decent (starters!)The irony of this experience is Honey & Co advertises itself with a seemingly assertive 'food from the Middle East' - and it felt like anything but. Overpriced as well.",

You share bread, jam, labneh, fruit with granola, and fresh lightly pickled vegetables.You also order a \"main\" egg dish for each person at the table, so we ordered the green Shakshuka (with spinach instead of tomatoes) and the Phylas: cheese and labneh with egg in a phyllo pastry. To wash everything down, he had a latte and I had a Turkish coffee. I didn't taste the latte but I have to say that the Turkish coffee didn't quite pass muster. It was missing the thick rich mouthfeel and strong flavor. The food ingredients here are top-notch quality. Everything was fresh and presentation-wise, they're killing it. Gorgeous small dishes filled every square inch of our table. I felt like a KING! But somehow, this breakfast dishes didn't come together for me quite right. I'm a taster by nature--really love little bites of sweet to savory throughout a meal so I was surprised that this combination didn't leave the lasting impression I would have thought, knowing my taste preferences.The green Shakshuka was far too herby (you can only have so much raw dill) and was watery - diluting any flavors. The hummus, labneh and zataar were good, as was the fresh fruit in granola. The Phylas was okay, but I prefer a version of this I get at home at my favorite Turkish restaurant. I've seen the other pictures of the food here and wondered if maybe I ordered the wrong things? I'll definitely come back and try their other food!",

Also everything came very promptly, we'd managed to order, be served and eat our entire feast within an hour but were also given plenty of time to sit and relax afterwards.",

At my table we had the aubergine, meatballs, and lamb for entrees. For apps we had a pumpkin dish and falafel. The apps jumped off the table with their aesthetic but more importantly their taste. They were the stars of the show. The entrees again had a multitude of ingredients and flavors going on and were great. We all enjoyed it so much we all got dessert. I had traditional Turkish carrot cake \u00a0but one of my fellow diners had a truly traditional Turkish dessert that tasted like a chocolate cinnamon bun. Wow.",

I'd recommend getting the \"Big Breakfast\". The assortment of treats they bring out to start are simply perfection and the meal is, in my opinion, underpriced. I went on a weekday, but i'd imagine that they'd be busy on weekends so plan accordingly!",

I wanted to be friends with my waiters!I went with one friend and the set menu was definitely the way to go. The standouts from the set menu at the time were the tahini and the roasted aubergine. I have seriously never tasted anything as flavorful as the aubergine! The combination of the tart pomegranate with the smoky flavor of the BBQ makes my mouth water just writing this. They have an entire display of tasty-looking desserts as well but all the waiters recommended the \"life-changing\" cheesecake and they were not joking. I've never had anything like it! If in London, definitely make this a stop on your trip and I promise you will be blown away. It's a very cozy space though, so I highly recommend calling ahead for a reservation.",

I think they must have lost out order or missed it. Waited 35-40mins for the fig loaf toast and the sausage rolls. The coffee was ok, was a little disappointed by the sausage roll pastry. It was a little stale. The fig loaf was pretty dense and sweet, but I liked it, nicely paired with orange marmalade.The waitress did apologize in the end for the slow service and gave us some cakes to make up for the delay. They also took off one of the coffees from the check. Appreciate the kind gesture.Overall it could have been a better experience, I'd probably give it another chance. Hopefully it'll be better :)",

Of those two, I'm giving the 5 stars because of the cheesecake. It's not your ordinary cheesecake and is amazing in every way possible. It comes with blueberries and almond slices on top of a crunchy shell and there's just something absolutely amazing about it. The falafels weren't bad either but there was nothing crazy about them and for the portion and price, I'd probably just pass next time. The waiters were very friendly and even offered blankets to those of us sitting outside because it was a little chilly. The shop isn't big though so if you're going in a group, I'd suggest making reservations.",
