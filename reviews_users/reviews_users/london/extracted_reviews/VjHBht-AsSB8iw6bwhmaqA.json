I looks out across the canal and has a great feel to it. The dj's always play some great tunes, and if you can get past the sometimes heavy queues for the bar, it seems this place has it all. Would recommend Saturday instead of Friday night if you go out there though, as you get a much better mix of people there.",

Minty and dry. Also odd was their take on bruschetta - garlic bread with some sliced cherry tomatoes and slices of prosciutto - something I would make as a late night snack at home. When i eat out I want to eat something I can't be bothered going to the effort of preparing!Not the cheapest place to eat either, but the ambiance, decor and service make me love it just a little more than I should.",

    "text": "Well known, well loved. The Lock Tavern is a valuable member of the Camden drinking establishments so as a result it is often full to the brim, overflowing, chocka-block. If you're looking for something other than the relaxed, hippy Camdenite (more 90's than noughties I know) or 'I'm still crying over the Libertines being over' Indie crowd than the Tavern is the only place to venture. Having said this I can't guarantee that you won't be served by a lank haired, skinny jeaned depressed individual (really- haven't people heard that it's NOT true not washing your hair for 6 weeks results in it cleaning itself???!)- there are a handful that make you feel so very clean and straight-laced and who abuse you with a look when you don't plonk a penny or pound into the tips jar. All this aside it's nice. Desperately and grubbily cool but nice none-the-less and good fun. Word to the wise in case you haven't already figured- don't go drinking there if you are feeling a little vulnerable. Or Ladies- if you are over 5ft2'' tall and in suffering a week bladder- you'll have problems closing the doors on the toilet cubicles when you sit down.",

The outside deck is good for groups of people if you can find a seat, however I especially love the ground floor courtyard, feels just like you are having a drink at a friend's house party!What I love about this bar: The GORGEOUS boys who work there; the reasonably priced drinks; the beautiful arty crowd; Friday nights at the barWhat I don't love about this bar: the embarrassing behaviour of 'laddish' boys on Sundays; crowds on Sunday afternoon!",

My favourite thing about this place is the outdoor seating and the free live music. At night fairy lights decorate one of the outdoor levels, (and yes it's not so romantic with plumes of cigarette smoke everywhere, it's still an awesome place and great for people spotting). The beer is also pretty well priced for London and I found that they had loads of friendly staff so queueing wasn't an issue either. I might not live in London anymore, but it's still the first place I choose when I hit Camden for drinks.

The waiters usually look modelesque and there are few urban legends that state the manager does not hire anyone she deems too unattractive (but this is probably a lie).",

    "text": "The Lock tavern is where I discovered my love for bison grass vodka and apple juice. Admittedly this is a love I often neglect, I try out other new drinks, flirt was the potential of Dissarono on the rocks, but like any true romance bison grass and apple juice is always waiting for me when I see my senses.I must point out that The Lock Tavern also offers other drinks, in fact they have a very well stocked bar. I love to visit this place on a Friday night when they've got a great DJ playing to dance the night away. They also have an awesome outside area which is great in the Summer. My friends and I have been known to pass a few Sunday afternoons out here, drinking in the sunshine and eating one of the Tavern's great roasts.My only problem with this place is, that like anywhere good, it is often too busy to tolerate. Arrive here at ten o'clock on a Saturday night and you won't be able to move for people. This makes queuing for the bar a bit tedious and being too squashed together can generally dampen an evening. Taking this in to consideration, while I would recommend it here I would have to suggest that you time your visit well.",

The place is a little pretentious for my liking and I much prefer their other pub, The Amersham Arms, in New Cross, the vibe is much more chilled out.The food is good and pubby, drinks are averagley priced for the area. I would avoid during weekends as this is when the more school aged kids take over, thinking that they are the bees knees. However, on a weekday is it a cosy hang out, and in the summer the terrace is pretty cool. I seem to remember that they do great deals on Pimms. Well you can't go wrong with that, can you? If you are a HSP like myself, then try to avoid staring at the annoying people in there, there seems to have been an increase of late, and you will just end up getting irritated. Try and find a corner and nurse a pint with a friend, have some cheesy chips and you will be just fine!",

    "text": "Although the Lock Tavern is occasionally in danger of believing its own too -cool- for- school hype (is there a place in Camden that doesn't?), this place has more than enough redeeming features to warrant a visit. The Lock is arranged over 2 floors. The bottom floor is filled with insolent young things sprawled over battered sofas and a DJ in the corner. Outside in the garden are the smokers - there are usually more people out than in. Upstairs is another room, DJ section and a large roof terrace with about 5 large tables that overlook Camden High Street. There are also a couple of heaters out here, and the tables are covered by patio umbrellas, so you can be up here in most weather. The Lock does a full food menu, although when I have come here for Sunday lunch they had ran out of food. Also just because they claim to be 'A Tarted Up Boozer', don't think that you are going to get tarted up drinks. My friend found this out when he asked for a particularly fluffy cocktail and was met with a withering look from the barman. The Lock is known for it's guest DJ nights, and they are well worth checking out. I came here for a Late Night Tales set dj'd by Nouvelle Vague which was brilliant. If you want to check out the DJ sets I would make sure that you pitch up early because this place can get pretty rammed, to the point that \u00a0you won't be able to get in.",

The front room is large, with several tables. It's almost always busy here, because being down in the front mean you're assured to see and be seen. Go to the back and up some stairs, though, and you can choose a couple of options. Continue on and out the back, and there's a large partly-covered garden with bench tables. Continue upstairs, and there's a smaller lounge with its own small bar - you'll often find a DJ up here spinning tunes in the evening. Continue through that bar, and you'll emerge into a roof terrace, for those who like to drink outside and hear the Camden traffic roll by. Having all these areas to choose from, the too-hip-for-you crowd, and some genuinely delicious food make this a super place for meetups. My circle of friends has often used the Lock as a birthday celebration point. The interior spaces are all painted quite darkly, so it's more on the dim chill-out side than bright and lively.",

For example, come in on Sunday at noon and there's chilled out music playing in the background and people seated, chatting, and eating the great roasts they serve every Sunday. On the other hand, pop by on a Saturday night and the DJ upstairs will be spinning good, danceable music (last time I went they were playing a great selection of remixes of funk and old school R&B) and the funky clientele is dancing, drinking, smoking outside, and generally just having a good time. With two floors and two great outside areas, this is a great place to hang out, whether you're a smoker or not.If you are looking for a great time (regardless of the season, day of the week, or time of the day) with unpretentious Londoners, definitely stop by. And, of course, being right across from my favourite coffee shop, My Village Cafe, you know exactly where to go for a proper hot chocolate (more like chocolate soup!) once you are done with that tasty roast.I don't tend to give five stars, but this is my favourite place in Camden.Bon app\u00e9tit / party on.

On Saturday night I turned up with four friends, all visiting from America, it was around 9:30pm and the place looked pretty empty. As we walked up to the door the bouncer looked expectantly at me asked if we had \"regulars cards\", when I told him we didn't he said \" only people with regulars cards can come in tonight\". I didn't ask anymore questions because he didn't look like he was in the mood to argue. We'd arranged to meet some other friends there so we had to wait around outside for them to show up before we could pick a different pub for the evening and while we waited we saw a large number of people get turned away for the same reason. This seems like a completely ridiculous decision because the bar looked completely dead with spare tables and a completely empty roof terrace. Also I've been there a few times on a Saturday night before and I was never asked to show a regulars card. After doing a quick google search there was no mention of this policy on their facebook or twitter and their website is under construction. Despite this incident the pub itself is really nice, with a good selection of food & drink, plus an excellent roof terrace and a cool atmosphere. After spending a lot of time here recently I thought it was one of the best places in Camden to go for a drink or to grab some food. However on the basis of this shitty Saturday night policy which seems completely nonsensical I doubt I'll ever bother with The Lock Tavern again. There are better bars and pubs in Camden who's policy isn't to turn customers away from their half empty establishments.",

This is the kind of clientele this popular pub attracts: interesting, cool, sometimes self -consciously so, and with good reason.

The atmosphere was cool, and the place was crawling with eclectics and hipsters. And the sound wasn't that bad either. The sound guy really did his job. But the service at the bar was horrible! My friends and I had to deal with a very rude mustached bar man the whole evening! He'd just stand there sipping his lager like he didn't notice the 5 people waiting to be served! I'd come back, but a little reluctantly.",

BUT, the staff at the Lock Tavern (and especially one of the managers) made us feel completely at home while we were waiting. They gave us tea and let us use wifi and the phone. We ordered lunch (which was really really good -- the bangers and mash are bangin'), and they returned the money to us! Incredibly kind, incredibly helpful, incredibly welcoming to three stranded grad students. This is hospitality at its finest. They deserve your patronage. The food is good, and they are good people.",

It epitomises a Camdenites watering hole like no other bar in the borough. Yet try as I might I cannot help but love this bar.It is chock full of Camden's coolest with kids who dress down to dress up but still look chic. Sexy boys and sexy girls lounge out on the roof terrace, down in the beer garden or hang in either of the two bars drinking the night away in Kool Kid Heaven. Known for its blistering live music line up's Lock Tavern rarely disappoints. My only bug bear is that this place can get really busy.My favourite time to come here is in the day before the crowds arrive. Do not get me wrong you will rarely get Lock Tavern to yourself, but at least now you can enjoy the food menu, which is surprisingly good.Great bar and the place to be seen on a weekend in Camden.",

Through the boozers doors lies a dark and very cool place. Lit with those red candle jar style holders that are simply everywhere good in my books. It screams hip, music and a bit 'sure' even. Barmen and women are both equally attractive and I can't decide if the bloke or the bird is fitter in this case...boyfriend spends evening eyeing up the skinny maids with my approval. Upstairs is gig focused, all red lights, AMAZING music being played until act came on. We were here for Cashback, which was ace. Free as well. So many hip hop type old skool fun tunes, not pretentious shit that you can't move to played before acts came on.. Loved. It being Valentine's weekend they had special cocktails which I sampled all of. Bellini was bit shit as had cheap champagne but 'Sex Juice' more than made up for it. Lethal concoction of strawberry stuff and Voddie. Yum. It does get heavingly busy but all good. Great music, the burgers looked to die for on way out and a great time was had here.

After wandering around Camden Lock Market, it was the perfect distance between the market and the tube stop - great for that final stop, especially if you're unfamiliar with the area and don't want to venture too far afield.Inside is quite standard pub decor, with some nice flowers in the middle of the tables and menus printed on brown paper. I must say, the food looked cracking; visiting on a Sunday meant it was predominantly roasts coming out of the kitchen, but options included a delicious sounding duck breast, and some of the biggest Yorkshire puddings London's probably seen.Service was slow to start off with, obviously annoying me at first, until we realised that the huge table in the corner had all ordered coffees, much to the dismay of the one person behind the bar. When it did come round to our turn, drinks were poured quick as anything. It looks like there's more to explore upstairs and outside, and apparently some game machines built into the tables upstairs, which I'll be sure to revisit in the future.",

If you can tolerate hipsters staring at you and wondering why you're not wearing a trilby or cultivating a moustache. But that's ok.In the evening, it does get busy, and past a certain time they have a ludicrous policy of only letting you in if you have a locals card. Which is a right pain in the arse if you're meeting friends here and you don't have one.They do often have decent music and DJs on, and in the summer there aren't many better places to enjoy the temperature than on their roof terrace, crammed in with your fellow drinkers.In summary, you just can't rely on this place.

The decor is hip and cool, the hottest new bands and DJs play here yet there is always a great atmosphere. Although this could so easily be a pretentious place, it somehow manages not to be, everyone is welcome (except trouble makers!) and it's a really friendly vibe. As it's in Camden you do get some tourists in but they mix with the locals and hipsters and all in all it's just one big party!If you like a good old fashioned rave-up check out monthly night 'ASBO', smiles all round!Staff are friendly, helpful and attentive, the food is delicious and there is an impressive selection of drinks.I've had some of the best days/nights of my life in this pub!

Unlike The Hawley, it manages to retain it's dirty Camden chic without turning into a 'cooler-than-thou' watering hole for London's elite.They do an amazing Sunday roast (between 12pm and 2pm so get there quick) as well as seasonal drinks like mulled wine in winter and a gorgeous Pimms in the summer.",

    "text": "I'm a semi-frequent visitor to London, and I spend a fair amount of time in the Camden area. As mentioned in some previous reviews, experiences here do seem to depend on what day/time you visit. I've been to this pub a few times; my best experience was on a Monday afternoon near the end of a trip, at which point I happened to have an excruciating hangover (I know, it sounds delightful already). The pub was practically deserted at this time, and the bartender was very accommodating in my request for a Bloody Mary that I hoped could bring me up from 75 to 100 percent human. He took great care in crafting what turned out to be a generously endowed and delicious cocktail, and provided some nice conversation during the process of creating the drink. On the back of this event, I ordered lunch (which was also nice) and had a second cocktail-- slightly adapted from the first according to my feedback-- while watching the world go by on a lazy afternoon.I have passed by this location a few times at night on the weekend, and it seems a bit intimidating with the bouncers outside and the apparent 'locals only' policy. However, there are so many other venues nearby to check out that it barely registers as an issue in my opinion. I would highly recommend this pub for a late afternoon visit or the occasional boozy lunch. As for the overly trendy evenings? If you don't like it, walk a block in either direction and find something that fits your taste!",
