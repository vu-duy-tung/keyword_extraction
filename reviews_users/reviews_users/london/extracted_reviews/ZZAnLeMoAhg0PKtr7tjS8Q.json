Finally I managed to get a table when I walked in recently. The Gay Hussar looks a bit old fashioned and its walls are plastered with drawings of people who supposedly dined there. I liked the images and thought it's an original feature and more interesting than random paintings or white walls. The first disappointment came with the wine menu. While the menu looks fine, I was not happy that they offer only the unspecified house wine by the glass. I really do not like when places only offer one random wine by the glass. Anyway, the house white was alright, so it was not too bad. I started my dinner with the delicious brown bread with butter. At many restaurants you get somewhat bland white bread. Not here. At The Guy Hussar I enjoyed very tasty brown bread with a bit of butter, definitely one of the better breads you can get in London. Then I continued with Debreceni Kolb\u00e1sz, basically a spicy Hungarian sausage. As I went there in my discovery of the best Wiener schnitzel in London, I ordered \"B\u00e9csi Szelet\", the veal escalope with potates. First, there are not many places in London that have veal escalope on the menu. And second, this was definitely one of the best Wiener schnitzels I had in London so far. The bread crumbs were light brown and in contrast to many other places, the crust was what I would call fluffy. Really nice and tasty and just like a good escalope should be. The only criticism is that the large escalope with tasty sliced and roasted potatoes was a bit try. I should really have asked for some gravy to go with it.For dessert I decided to order the \"Dobos Torta\", a \"layered gateau with caramel top\" that tasted very good. The Gay Hussar is a busy place and it can be difficult to get a table without a booking. It might not cater all tastes, but no question, if you like a good veal escalope, this is a place for you.",

    "text": "If ever you were to try and find a gay hussar in London I reckon Greek Street in Soho would be as apt a place as any to start looking! Luckily for us Londoners, this glad Hungarian eatery has been serving excellent continental cuisine for more than 50 years in one of London's most atmospheric and authentic central European restaurants. There are many reasons to love the Gay Hussar. It's the sort of place where aged gentlemen donning tweet jackets and speaking with marbles in the mouth upper crust accents go to discuss terribly important matters over terribly delicious lunches. It's also a restaurant renowned for its favoured status among politicos (as a wall full of caricatures of notable politicians who've dined here attests). Indeed, rumour has it Tom Blair was persuaded to run for PM right here in this den-like Soho institution. You certainly can't blame such big wigs for frequenting this restaurant. With its the cushy benches, wood panelling and invitingly delectable old world aromas wafting out from the kitchen, the Gay Hussar is as cosy as they come (the private dining rooms on the first and second floors ensure discretion too). Of course, the Hussar's real draw is the food \u00a0and especially the goulash! Yes, the Gay Hussar's veal goulash with galuska (satisfyingly clumpy little doughy dumplings) is a treat. Best saved for dreary winter dining but devour-able all year round, this savoury and paprika-rich dish is probably the most warming meal to be had in the whole West End. Consider visiting at lunch when \u00a318.50 buys two courses and \u00a321.50 allows for a third. I heartily recommend the fried mushrooms with tartar sauce as a starter and have no complaints about the poppyseed strudel with vanilla ice cream for puds. There's a wonderful 'best of Hungary' wine list for connoisseurs as well. A perfect venue for the festive season or any occasion requiring an intimate setting for supper, the Gay Hussar sets a remarkable tone. As for this restaurant's name, well, when it opened the word gay didn't have the connotations it does today and was simply meant to describe the fiery and exuberant nature of Hungarian calvarymen, whom Gay Hussar founder Victor Sassie held in the highest regard after serving in Budapest during the Second World War. A comfortable and historic setting with the best goulash in London \u00a0splendid doesn't begin to describe this marvellous restaurant.",

This fine place serves some true, homely Hungarian dishes - all typically stodgy, hearty and meaty. It is authentic with such things as strudel, goulash and galuska on the menu. Just reading what's they have on offer makes you feel so full!Where do I begin? For a starter you could have the Beef Goulash Soup (so filling it might as well be a main course) or Fish Dumplings in a creamy dill and mushroom sauce (again, very filling). I think it's just best to go straight to the main course and skip the starters as oh my are they rich. Go for the intensely substantial Chicken in a Creamy Paprika Sauce and Galuska (small dumplings). The light spicy twinge of the paprika is complimented by the smoothness of the heavy cream. Chicken is a good meat for this dish as any other \u00a0would almost be too much with such a creamy filled sauce, and don't forget the galuska which are little balls of stodge! If you still have space for it, you should try their walnut pancakes with chocolate sauce which goes down a treat.",

    "text": "As far as I'm aware, this is one of the two(!) London based Hungarian restaurants. It's famous for being a former(?) haunt of the political classes, and the caricatures that cover one wall downstairs remember some of the regulars. I'm not an expert, but I picked out Greg Dyke, the late Robin Cook, Norman Lamont (the eyebrows gave it away), Alastair Campbell (not a flattering picture), and various others. Apparently lots of unofficial deals and connivings have happened in the upstairs rooms in the past. Sadly we were seated downstairs, so missed out on any potential eavesdropping. I went because of my ever-increasing enthusiasm for things Hungarian, and the menu is a brilliant Magyar nostalgia-fest. From goulash soup (guly\u00e1sleves) cold sour-cherry soup (hideg meggyleves - better than it sounds), to paprika chicken (paprik\u00e1s csirke), stuffed cabbage (t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt k\u00e1poszta) and thick, paprika-laden stews (p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt), you can chow on down and pretend you're in Budapest. The only major difference is the fish - Carp, the fish of (Hobsons) choice in Hungary has been substituted with seabass and other far nicer fish requiring access to the seaside. The GH carries a selection of Hungarian wines, in addition to international choices. The red we had was good, and the wine list also includes an example of the delicious dessert wine from the Tokaji region - well worth splashing out on a glass to finish your meal. If you've never tried Hungarian food before, this is a good place to do it. Ok, ok, so it's possibly also one of only two places to do it in London, but regardless. The food's well prepared, and, though a little dear at full price they have been known to do discounts through restaurant-booking sites, so keep your eyes peeled.",

There doesn't seem to be a lot of seating, but there is an entire extra upstairs dining area where we were shown when we arrived.I opted to order a bottle of the Hungarian Cabernet Sauvignion, and I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. I've had Tokaji in the past, so I know that was good, but I didn't know Hungarians could also do a decent job with regular wine as well.I ordered the mixed appetizers to start and the stuffed cabbage for a main. The appetizers were great, and it was nice having a selection of goodies to eat. I also tried the various soups, and the beef goulash soup was really great too. The cherry soup was flavorsome, but it was also really rich and sweet and the people who ordered it found it hard to finish. The stuffed cabbage was fantastic. I want the recipe. It was full of flavor and really well done. Several of us ordered it, and we were all happy. I also got an order of the poppyseed streudel for dessert, and everyone who tried it was really pleased.Gay Hussar makes some fantastic food, and I think I ordered well. I would definitely come back at another time to try some of the other wines and perhaps some of the other food as well. (Although that stuffed cabbage was so good, I might not.)",

    "text": "Overall the quality of the foods is average. I have been to Hungary and tried the local foods there before. So I could compare the hungarian dishes in london and hungary. Taste are quite similar. Some dish are good but other dish could be bad. \u00a0Veal Wiener Schnitzel with Saute Potatoes and Pepper Salad...the Potato is too dry and hard like dry potato chips. Veal Goulash with Galuska it come with rice, real good portion. Smoked Breast of Goose with S\u00f3let and Red Cabbage...seem to be my favourite. Certainly the prices is not cheap. But if u really missed hungarian foods, may be you could try this as the location is right in the heart of soho...very close to Soho square.",

I ordered the soup, which was watery with almost no meat and excessively spicy. Next came a Wiener schnitzel that was overcooked and excessively breaded. the breading was even falling off. It was amateur hour. Finally the cucumber salad: limp and flavorless. At least it was expensive.",

    "text": "This is an aggregate of 2 visits to the Gay Hussar. The first visit was with Andrew M's alpahbet dining gang - obviously, we were having H for Hungarian food that nightWe really enjoyed the roasted foie gras that night, judging it the best that we'd tasted in London. So, when we heard that the Gay Hussar was going to close recently, we made a reservation to have the foie gras again while we still couldThe Gay Hussar has been a fixture in Soho for many decades, being the favourite haunt of many famous politicians and writers as evidenced by photographs on the walls. The building does have an oldey worldey feel to it with creaky stairs and narrow passageways. On both visits, they put our group into the private dining room on the second floor for no extra costWe had our own waiter for the room. He was efficient if a little slow to warm up to real friendliness. We also had problems getting the bill on both visits - perhaps we don;t quite fit the demographic of their usual clienteleThe aforementioned seared foie gras was rich and nutty with caramelised edges, topped off with sweet caramelised onion. We all agreed that it tasted better the first time round for some reasonWe did try a lot of their dishes between us. I remember that the meat is better than the fish - the duck, goose and venuson were nice. The seafood dishes were less successfulThis classic London restaurant is worth a visit for the foie gras but stick to the meaty dishes",

Growing up with a Hungarian grandmother next door who could cook lights out Hungarian I'm well versed in the cuisine and can pick things out of a non-English Hungarian restaurant menu with ease. \u00a0No need for that skill here since there are English translations of the dishes on the menu.First off, starting with some good Hungarian wine is a must and they have a very good selection. Hungarian wine is an underappreciated offering and is a far better bargain than a lot of others. It's not the Bulls Blood you see here in the States, oh no. It is spectacular wine of remarkable depth and character. \u00a0The appetizers must include of the cherry soup which is a delight. And the smoked Hungarian sausage is a good adder to get you started. I'm a huge fan of their Porkolt and the chicken Paprikash. Of course you can get the standard fare like goulash and schnitzel but you can get that anywhere. Go for something a little more out of your comfort zone - have you had smoked goose breast before? I'm betting you haven't. Try it. \u00a0Order another bottle of wine. Save room for the palacsinta with walnuts and chocolate sauce. Yum. I'm going back on my next trip to London for sure! Loved it!",

    "text": "I first visited the Gay Hussar in 2001. As someone of Hungarian ancestry, it's so hard to find a Hungarian restaurant anywhere, and I will always take advantage of it. In 2001, my parents and I all remembered the Gay Hussar being unbelievably good. My dad always said it was the best duck of his life. Fast forward to 2014 when I finally returned. Many trips to London in between had never found the Gay Hussar fitting in to my schedule, and I was excited to fit it in this trip, albeit for lunch this time.The space hasn't changed. I don't think it ever has. It's small, old, but comfortable. The lunch menu had 2 or 3-course meals for 21 and 25 pounds respectively, or you could order a la carte, which my wife and I did. First off, the food took FOREVER. Unacceptably long. The place really wasn't too busy, but it took at least an hour for it to come. Ridiculous, unacceptable. The service throughout was pretty mediocre - order, deliver, and pay are the only times the staff will even look at you. No \"how is your food\", no \"more water?\". Nothing. The food itself was mixed. My pork was okay. My wife's stuffed cabbage was really good. Portions were small for the price, and quality didn't seen to make up for it. Even for London, the prices were just too high. I miss the old G.H. I heard it was going on bad times and might close. It should. Pitiful excuse of a Hungarian restaurant, and bad representation of the fantastic country of Hungary.",

    "text": "From the moment I stepped in I already felt I was warped back in time to the 1950s. Creaky floorboards, dark wooden paneling and a book shelf filled with old worn out political books. Wall covered with comical sketches of politicians. It did feel like a serious place to be. This was magnified by the fact it was dead silent when we walked in with only one other table taken and the rest of the place empty. We were early though and soon it got busy. For a place so empty in the beginning we did feel very awkward and exposed, craving for some light music in the background for some distraction. But it became understandable when other guests of journalists and suited people came in that this was no average romantic restaurant to dining. The place was small, narrow and confined- could be quite claustrophobic once it filled up. Till now I cannot decide if I liked the atmosphere or dislike as it was just awkward but interesting at the same time,Bread was already laid on the table with butter and next to that two red chillis for snacking- interesting, The butter and bread were forgettable and the chilli were mild but got spicy once you bit into the seeds. My boyfriend enjoyed those and described it like bell pepper on the outside, But food is what makes this place worthwhile. Our starter of a smoked Hungarian sausage was an excellent choice to get our tastebuds going, plump, juicy and peppery and went well with the gherkin and horseradish sauce that gave it that extra kick of flavour. However I did not taste any smokiness as much as I enjoyed it. Being pancake day we could not resist but order the chicken pancakes with spinach and rice as a main. It came in a very generous portion of two which probably matched up to it's high pricing. Personally I enjoyed this. It was hearty and comforting ,all soft textures, quite a filling heavy dish especially with the sour cream, the rice and the delicious tomato sauce it came in. The spinach was amazing, flavoursome and tasted fresh along with the fluffy rice that was lovely with the sauce and gave the dish a good bite.A more interesting dish and uniquely presented was the Smoked Goose breast which sat on a deep fried lattice fortress, filled with a bean stew under red cabbage with a dollop of cranberry sauce on the side. I wasn't too sure the flavours went well together with the cabbage being too sweet and watery for the bean stew and it definitely did not need a sugary coating from the cranberry sauce. But separately it can be admired for it's individual flavours. The goose was served pink, smokey and meaty- resembled a lot like roast pork. It was delicious. The beans were cooked well, \u00a0till tender, delicate flavours, another comfort delight with a nice crunch from the potato lattice. Personally I thought the red cabbage was cooked too long as it lost all it's texture. A slight bite to it would have improve this dish slightly. This dish was quite a mix bag together.We finished the meal with more pancakes and ordered both that was offered, Sweet Cheese Pancakes and Walnut Pancakes with chocolate Sauce. The Sweet Cheese Pancake definitely won me over. The perfect balance of sweet, soft creaminess and citrusy zing from the oranges was just a pure delight. And it was those soft textures coming together that made me prefer it over the walnut pancake. I didn't particularly enjoy the broken pieces of walnut inside of the pancake and it needed some sort of cream to bring the dish together. The chocolate sauce made it very heavy and rich but not sweet enough. It wasn't bad but wasn't great either.I did find Gay Hussar a very interesting meal. A lot of things that could be improved but I did find things I enjoyed a lot. Prices are very steep so a Tastecard offering 50% would be helpful or otherwise not really worth it. Service was slightly cold and a bit too formal by our male waiter but I think he was too used to serving politicians.Sadly the vibe just didn't suit us as nice as the food could be. Still it was a great insight to the political history of the place and I did not regret my visit.",

Two tips: book a table ahead of time (it was so small and packed I was very glad we did) and give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it, because the service takes a long time. We gave ourselves about an hour and twenty minutes, but that flew by and suddenly we realized we still hadn't gotten our food 15 minutes before we needed to leave for the show! Another thing to note is that if you get a starter, they will wait for you to tell them you're ready to get the main dish - we didn't realize this until we'd been waiting a while.However, it was tasty food. Only one vegetarian option for the main dish, so naturally I went for the classic - veg goulash. We all split a Hungarian appetizer platter, and I picked out the few salad parts. I also enjoyed the red Bull's Blood Hungarian wine. I had never had Hungarian food, but I was happy with it and glad to try it. I just really wish we didn't have to down it so fast and could savor it longer. I also wish we would've had time to try a dessert, because they looked delicious!I came with friends/coworkers, and our group was two girls and a guy. Our server was Hungarian and quite a character - we got the impression that he assumed that my female friend and I were a couple! I guess mainly gays go to Gay Hussar. But it was funny, anyways. If you have plenty of time, I recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "I had been dying to try Gay Hussar for the longest time with my dear Hungarian friend; but that never happened, because she moved back to Budapest. So when a friend from HK was visiting, I took her on her \"I want to try something different\" offer, and made a 7PM reservation for six people. I was somewhat surprised by the alacrity with which this reservation was made because i remember distinctly that a couple of times I did try making a reservation in the past, the response was \"We've got something at 10PM, or at 6PM\". OK - so, Gay Hussar - not so busy in the summer?? True to my conclusion, the ground floor had a few vacant tables even at 9PM.Hungary is a big wine producing nation. But you don't get to see that many Hungarian wines because they drink it all up before exporting any. We tried the Egri Blauburger 2008, simply because it said \"light, smooth and easy\". And easy it was. With 13% alcohol content, it went down like water. For the rest of the evening, the popular vote of the table was to continue with the same bottle.One of us got the P\u00e1colt Hering which is a marinated fillet of Herring with soured cream. Beautifully laid out, it gushed a million flavours into my mouth. Good pick.I ordered the Veal Goulash with Galuska (hungarian for sp\u00e4tzle). The meat was fresh and the stew was fairly mild. So, yes, good quality food - but they could have been a little more generous with the quantity - after all it's just a stew, not caviar! My friend from HK got the Venison Goulash with Tarhonya (egg drop pasta) and red cabbage. This goulash was rich and red probably because of the wine. I could also taste the paprika afresh. Two of my co diners, one of whom got the schnitzel, and the other, the fish, said that their respective mains were \"dry\". I didn't taste portions from their plates, so I will not base my rating on their comments.Gay Hussar should showcase more paprika types on the table, both fresh and ground for diners to be able to sample this wondrous fruit which is almost synonymous with popular Hungarian culinary culture. There was one kind of chilli pepper on the table, but I was expecting more bell peppers, apple paprikas that I could savor with the meat.Desserts were good. The Gundel Palacsinta or Walnut Pancakes with Chocolate Sauce were like crepes with walnut crushed nutella. Delicious! The Dobos Torta - Layered Gateau with Caramel Top, was average - seemed like something you'd find in an average bakery. The Makos Retes (Poppy Seed Strudel with Vanilla Ice Cream) was definitely the best of the lot. I'd go back to Gay Hussar just for a bite of that bad boy.I would totally go back to Gay Hussar. I would say slightly overpriced on the mains, the wines/appetisers/desserts seem about right. So overall good value for money, friendly and prompt service and of course - fabulous location.",

There's enough people here who love that cuisine that some cook would make a proper home-style place. Guy Hussar had high potential in this regard. It does look like a great joint, the service was nice too. The food however is unlike anything I've ever had in Hungary. I imagine that this is the type of stuff they serve at a 2-star motel/diner! The menu had all the familiar choices with all the same home-style potential, but failed miserably. Maybe its just that this restaurant had the proper food originally but the English client\u00e8le couldn't handle the spice and herbs, so they brought it down a few notches? Whatever the case, this food was bland. So bland in fact that I couldn't distinguish any one flavour or another, it was just like coloured tofu. My Hungarian girlfriend had the crispy goose which was equally (if not more) disappointing. Again, no flavour at all. Just ingredients that were cooked bare-bones without any kind of traditional seasoning. I could listen that there were other Hungarian patrons in the room as well, all with similar attitudes. Bottom line is this restaurant, or any ethnic restaurant, should NEVER cater to the English! Remember they aren't widely known for their centuries of culinary excellence (they colonized other countries for that). Instead restaurants should cater to themselves, to the food THEY want. I guarantee that Guy Hussar is not doing that now.",

The service was wonderful - the waiter gave us half a bowl of the cherry soup to try before ordering, since none of us had had it before, and he talked us through the menu very clearly - and the food was mostly delicious.The one thing that didn't impress me were the chicken pancakes. Not sure if it just wasn't to my taste, or if it just wasn't what I was expecting, or what. But it was a bit saucy and didn't impress me as much as anyone else's mains. Everyone else's dish, by the way, was fantastic. It was my first experience with Hungarian food though, so I'm not sure how it compares to other Hungarian cooking.The cherry soup, by the way, is delicious - as was the poppy strudel we shared for dessert. We all definitely plan on returning.",
