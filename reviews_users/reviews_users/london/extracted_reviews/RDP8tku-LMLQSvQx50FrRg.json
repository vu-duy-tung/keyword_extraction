As other reviewers have said, you have to wait for the meal (today there was a long queue as well) but it's certainly worth the wait. Extremely fresh tasting food which is made to order, with side dishes of sauce at various levels of spicyness. The summer rolls really tasted like summer, which was quite an achievement for a winter's day in Westfield shopping centre. I wasn't feeling adventurous enough for the weasel coffee a rare coffee regurgitated by wild Vietnamese weasels. I came over a bit Catherine Tate when I saw that. Coffee, regurgitated by weasels, and this was Shepherd's Bush. Dirty B'stards ;-) But instead had a freshly made carrot, apple and ginger juice which balanced the spicy meal really well.",

Sometimes the broth for Pho can be bland. At some locations, it taste like my mum's cooking. Other times, they miss the mark. The chicken for Bun Ga was horrible in general. It was more like salad with roasted chicken. I drowned that dish with fish sauce and it still didn't taste any better. Food is mostly decent, but it is NOT authentic Vietnamese food.",

(edit: There's an extra \"Tom\" suffix after the name of the dish if I wanted mine with prawns, which my sister probably missed out when ordering. Okay.)The noodles were very tasty, and the ingredients were generous. The spiciness level was definitely above that of the average apprehensive-when-it-comes-to-spicy-Asian-food English person, but it was manageable for myself - my spiciness-tolerance-level isn't that high either.My sister got the famed beef noodles. (edit: there are about 8 types of beef noodles on the menu and I don't know which one she got) I have no idea why the dish is the star of the menu, it really was nothing much. The beef balls were pretty good, but the soup was average. Maybe it's because I've had better ones from Southeast Asia itself, and that the dish is a rare treat in this part of the world?The food court is a lovely place to sit in, and there's free wi-fi too.",

We got the spicy chicken noodles and the steak and garlic noodles.Both had lots of meat and noodles in them, however we did have to add a lot of spices and sauces to the broth to give it more flavour. I was absolutely stuffed afterwards!We also got the veggie summer roll which was really nice an refreshing. I liked the mint in it.",

I thought the last visit was a one off, clearly nobody here cares about serving decent noodles and Pho.",

Located in the food court of Westfield this is a relatively stapple / decent place to grab a quick bite.I have eaten here on two occassions but to be honest the food court at Westfield - as well as the restaurants offers so much variety I don't think this is a particular enditment.Avoid turning up too late during lunch as there tend to be queues - I guess that means that people do love this place.",

I was delighted with all of the herbs and spices used in the soup to create a more complex dish; however, I was a tad bit disappointed with the beef. It was neither a chunk or a thin slice, so the beef did not absorb the flavors of the soup as effectively as another cut would have.",

    "text": "This is now the FOURTH Pho location we've been to in the UK! \u00a0I think I should get a free one, or something. \u00a0This one is on the upper floor of the Westfield shopping center, in a little food court area. \u00a0They have a slightly smaller menu compared to the proper restaurant locations, but the prices are the same. \u00a0I ordered the chicken pho again, and the green beans/sugar snaps in peanut sauce as a side. \u00a0They gave us an electric buzzer while we took a seat (seating area in this part of Westfields is indoor, but great for people watching and has chargers for your phone!) and the food was ready in about 5 minutes.The pho comes in a wide bowl, not disposable even though it's a food court. \u00a0Nice as it feels more like a proper restaurant. \u00a0They have hot sauces at the counter that you can use to spice up your meal, and they give you a little bowl of herbs/chillis/bean sprouts as always. \u00a0After doctoring our soups to the proper temperature, we dug in - and they were lovely. \u00a0Just as they always are at a Pho restaurant, the broth was lovely. \u00a0I know it's not the classic pho, but I think the chicken broth is almost better than the beef! \u00a0It's more soothing in a way, like Asian chicken noodle soup. \u00a0It was hot (temperature-wise, also spicy after I dumped in some hot sauce), and truly hit the spot on a day when it was pouring rain. \u00a0The chicken was juicy and the noodles were abundant. \u00a0 I love the crisp veggies in the sweet and yummy peanut sauce as well, if you want a veg they are probably your best option.Very affordable, and a deliciously filling meal as always. \u00a0We're addicted, if you can't tell!",

    "text": "I hate giving a one star! I believe it reflects on me - on my poor choice. I don't like making poor choices. Unfortunately, you have to in order to learn. Let me start by saying that I am Asian, my bff is Vietnamese, I had a Viet ex-bf, and I've been to Hanoi, Vietnam. This will be a harsh judgment. It was my last day (maybe last two) in London with no wifi to steal so I can go on yelp, while I was in Shepherd's Bush. Yes, I was shopping if you had to ask, now whatever you think of me due to the places I visited, please put aside. I originally came from Oxford Circus and stopped here then I got hungry. My first intuition was to get out of the mall and eat somewhere else, even at Sam's Chicken, anywhere besides the food court inside the mall. Yet, I ignored them and ordered pho and egg rolls. They were the right size, mind you. They weren't American size, they were the perfect size! How dare you feed me this shit! Pho rice noodles shouldn't be this fat and soggy! The meat weren't supposed to be this cooked! My broth wasn't supposed to taste artificial! You were supposed to give me a bowl of rice noodles (cooked for 2 minutes, washed in cold water), a broth from a cow's hip bone (or some area) simmered for 24 hours (to get the bone fat in the broth), topped with onions, basil, mint, and coriander, with thin-sliced rare steak that will cook in me broth! Ask me what else could go wrong? My egg rolls weren't crunchy, no noodles inside, no meat, just nasty soil-tasting bean sprouts and carrots. No lettuce to wrap it in. It was the first time I didn't finish a bowl of pho and I was starving. I hate you! You even charged me \u00a312! Not even worth a fiver for both! I had to nurse my tummy with yummy old Jamaican ginger beer and a bag of Maltesers from Tesco. So bad, but ohhh so good!",

    "text": "We came here to grab a quick bite before the mall closed after a long day of shopping. We weren't too hungry so just needed something light. We decided on pho ga (chicken soup with rice noodles) and the imperial rolls. The imperial rolls were pretty good, nice and crispy. The noodles though.. for real... I've had sooo much better. The soup was ok but the noodles weren't chewy or fresh like pho noodles should be. They actually gave some decent amount of chicken though. The side mint was a nice touch.... but no lime!? The red jalape\u00f1o on the side was nice and spicy too but not the traditional green jalape\u00f1os. It was also sad that there was NO sriracha sauce... AHHHH!!Anyway, it wasn't all bad but definitely forgettable. A big fat minus is that its in an area by the ice skating rink. There was a super loud emcee yelling at the top of his lungs and it made the worst dining experience",

I've been four times now and tried four meals, including sides, and been thoroughly disappointed each time. Given the extortionate prices asked for what is essentially fast food, Pho Westfield should be ashamed of itself. The reviews on here are negative for a reason and I won't be back unless there's a visible change in quality. If you find yourself hankering for something to eat in the food-court that's fast, Chip & Fish, Yo! Sushi & that risotto place I can never remember the name of are all better alternatives.",
