I often enjoy the friendliness of the staff, and the bustling atmosphere downstairs.The beer is good and prices not too bad. Lots of information and history around the walls.Charles Dickens would have enjoyed visiting here. The 2nd floor restaurant has yet to be encountered, but the pizzas on the first floor were crisp, flavourful and imaginative, too big for my friend, but good value and a beautiful view. I could imagine Charles, if he was still around, quipping that 'with 9000 Pizzerias in New York alone,an American could rarely find a better setting than this.'",

It was like thai style and pretty good, but pricey, prob cus of beautiful location overlooking a small pier and rich boats near the London Bridge and Thames river. Everyone else got other random pizzas which they all liked. Can't complain, it's just high quality pizza. Not really worth it though only because it's London and you could eat other things (unless u need a pizza fix then I recommend it).",

Expect to spend about \u00a315 or more for pizza and a drink. yikes! My friend and I shared an Anatra, which I could have lived without, but duck on a pizza sounded interesting. The other guys' pizzas looked better: Quatro Fromaggi, Sorrento, and the Piccante. Too bad we didn't get one of those instead... =(",

An amazing setting amongst the posh yachts of London. The place itself is also a really nice building but I think it just suffers from it's own success. It needs a really good clean and repaint for one. The service has never been anything particularly good. They always seem overstressed, overworked and really not wanting to be there. The pizzas are really worth a visit. It;s just a shame that the management realise what potential they are sat on and start investing in some customer service training and some redecoration as then it really would be a destination venue.",

After 4.5 hours touring the Tower of London, we needed to sit down and have some food. We immediately looked for a pub. This place was warm on a blustery, rainy day, and looked promising. Good atmosphere, good beer and hard cider. We opted to split the \"ultimate\" fish and chips. The mushy peas were good ( so says my husband as I don't eat them), the chips were great, but the fish...not so much. Batter was doughy and not very crispy. A third of the fish was mushy and inedible. When we ordered we made it clear we were splitting the order. When it was delivered we asked for an extra plate and utensils. After five minutes I located the waitress and asked again. Her English seemed limited. She didn't understand what I wanted until I showed her another fork. We had time constraints and had to move on. A disappointment after all the great pub experiences we have had.",

Food and drinks are more expensive than in most other pubs but you pay for the view you enjoy while sitting at a window table on one of the upper floors. We had some glasses of high quality Chilean Chardonnay and French Rose as well as several pints of Guiness. Luckily me managed to order some crisps not to drink on empty stomachs. That is where the fun ended. We treid to order more drinks and food but it had gotten very busy and we could not attract any of the staff attentition. My boyfreind went four times to the bar but staff just pretended to not notice him. We spent an hour and a half in the pub and no one came to collect the empty glasses from our table or, at least check on how we were doing and believe me, we weren't a quiet and unnoticeable company.The funniest part of our trip was that despite this being Dad's second visit to London, the first time he came here in 1998, \u00a0he was taken to... the Dickens Inn (again). He said that the place does not look as charming as it was 16 years ago (even though smoking indoor is prohibited now). The hanging baskets and all the cuteness outside were all there but he remembers smoked ducks hanging from the ceiling above the bar on the first floor, making the place feel like an inn back in the old times. He had been there during the week and the staff had been more attentive.So overall I was not impressed with the place in terms of service but I was comforted by their choice for music and the Foo Fighters playing out loud!",

We somehow ended up at the Dickens Inn... and I have to say, it was not worth the walk. This place is massive. And from what I've seen, it's quite popular with workers from the City. Popular to the point of being obnoxiously crowded. The Dickens inn is aesthetically pleasing. There are nice flowers covering the railings and lining the outdoor area. And it is quite nice to enjoy a beer in the shadow of Tower Bridge. Yet, that is about all there is to say on atmosphere. Its one of those pubs that is too big for its own good. It may be able to serve a lot more customers, but it looses its personality along the way. Bar staff was really friendly, and its not an awful place to watch a football match. However, the beer selection leaves much to be desired. The draught list is little more than Star and Kronenbourg. In my humble opinion, the best beer on tap at the Dickens Inn is London Pride (not bad by any means, but nothing special). Independently, the Dicken's Inn is not a bad place by any measure. Yet, when you compare it to the high quality of pub that is available to you in London if you just make an effort, it definitely falls short.",

It was a gorgeous evening, so we thought our chances of bagging a table on one of the balconies were slim. Amazingly there was a free table straight away, and we couldn't believe our luck, looking out over the water as we sipped our drinks. OK, so the food isn't anything special, but that's not what we were there for. It was quick and served with a smile and a bit of friendly banter. So all in all a solid choice if you're in the area, and perfect on a mild, summer's evening.",

To some it might seem like an old fashioned London pub, in quite an idyllic location. To another observer it might seem like a tourist trap that doesn't need to try too hard as it will be busy whatever happens. I have enjoyed visits here in the distant past, I remember enjoying cheap and decent pizza upstairs on one occasion for example, but this rating is based on a recent visit (as it should be, because places can change) where the service seemed fairly distracted and the ale was not of a particularly good quality (you may as well not bother serving it if you're not going to serve it properly). Tables had also been left uncleaned for a while too. Some sporting event (it was rugby I think, so I didn't care) had just finished, which may be some sort of excuse. The pub has no link to Dickens whatsoever, I figure that is just a name that would appeal to tourists. I mean it's only about 20 odd years old. The building used to be a brewery elsewhere before being plonked down in the docks.",

    "text": "Right by the riverside against a great view, in an old rustic 18th century converted warehouse, what else do you want? It had the perfect atmosphere, warm, cosy, sensible people and it may be a bit tattered but it adds to the historical feel of it and I wouldn't change it at all. In fact I loved the whole building in was in and the whole location with the view of the boats, all very romantic. For a Saturday it wasn't even too pack as it is in quite a secluded area which is perfect for a tourist location, not a big fan of loud busy places.Service was also very friendly provided by a lady who was more than accommodating, helping us book via Toptable on last minute terms to help me collect my 100 points. Also very smiley and genuine which ticked points for good service.As it was the three of us we ordered the buffalo wings, olives and a medium pizza, half Florentine and meat feast. It was surprisingly large for a medium pizza & could easily feed 4. The wings were perfectly tender, succulent and big, in a really moreish sauce that wasn't too sweet & finger lickin good. \u00a0Olives were garlicky which we all loved although quite small in portion for its price.I must say the Florentine was slightly disappointing. Eggs were rubbery because they came boiled which is not how a Florentine should be done and they were quite bland overall. The meat feast however was delicious, packed with flavour,a good variety and quantity of toppings, good thick layer stringy cheese for the perfect pizza bite. if you're looking for a light pizza this place is not it. Food was slightly overpriced but that's predictable for \u00a0the location it's in and the novelty of having such a large pizza called the 'beast' served on a lifted platter. I suppose I would recommend for a special occasion especially in the location it's in and if you've got a group of people. Just make sure Florentine is not one of the pizza option you're picking and it should be fine and enjoyable. Wash it down with two shots of Malibu and coke like I did and it will be even better ;)",

I've only been here once and I sat outside but I liked the atmosphere. It was very busy, mainly as it was a Friday night after work so people were winding down. We ordered a pitcher of Pimms which came to around \u00a318 and had fresh cucumber, mint, lemon and strawberries in which was lovely and refreshing for a warm, balmy evening. And I love St Katharine's Dock - where it is located. Such a lovely area, especially on a hot summer evening.",

The hanging baskets and tattered feel all work very well to build an interesting atmosphere. Unfortunately the pub inside is completely let down and it destroys the whole atmosphere so it does only worth sitting outside.Food wise i have only tried the pizza which was quite nice but the \"beast\" is not sufficient to share between 4 people and the price was just ridiculous \u00a350 + 12.5% service charge.It probably works out better if you get 4 small pizzas instead of the beast both price wise and slices per person ratio. I wouldn't recommend the desserts/puddings as they are surprisingly small & blunt.I wouldn't make a specific trip just to visit this place but if you are around tower bridge and you can secure a seat at the balcony it is a much better option than the rest of the pubs in the area.",

The food was okay, nothing special. I had the Dickens Inn Chicken & Chips \u00a314.50, which comprised of chargrilled, \u00a0jerk-seasoned half chicken, chips & home-made slaw. The chicken was not very flavourful but juicy and not dry. I subbed the chips with onion rings, and I was super happy with the rings. My boyfriend got the chargrilled 28 Day Matured Rib-Eye Steak for \u00a318.50 with home made onion rings, chunky chips, flat mushroom & tomato. The steak was cooked right, the flat mushroom was flavourless. Everything tasted better with the Pepper Sauce but it was \u00a31.00 extra.The service was great, with the exception that they kept trying to get us to add more food all the time, which was strange. Otherwise, we loved their service.It's okay. Not great, but not too shabby.",

It has a fab d\u00e9cor from outside with leafy terraces. I had a pizza inside which was good and a good beer selection but this is all about wandering there on a nice sunny day and camping out to enjoy the buzz and exterior view. it's certainly unique. (as of May 20th 2015) A good mixed grill. A solid 6/10 Chips were highlight. Rump steak was not bad. Gammon good. Sausages I didn't like. But lovely pub though. Terraced in St Katherine's Dock this is a great place for a date or to show friends visiting. Perfect for summers day and pumps up stars because of that alone.",

I stopped by for drinks and dinner with a friend visiting from NYC (she chose it). It took me a while to find the pizzeria she was talking about but after wandering through a pretty unappealing pub area downstairs I found the gang on the top floor.The service was painfully slow when you wanted to order, but they were also nicely flexible (oblivious?!) about the group size ranging from 4 initially to 9 through the evening as people rocked up gradually after work (the lawyers last!). I enjoyed the goat's cheese pizza with red onion, and you could tell the base was freshly made which was a big plus considering it was a little heavy on the dough in the dough-to-topping ratio. The sides and other bits I munched (/stole) from others were also nice enough, but I thought quite pricey for what they were.It's in a great spot by the docks and I can see myself drifting back here if I was avoiding the chains nearby, but I can't say I'm in any rush as it's just a-ok for this price point.",

The pizza was really good and the crust was exceptional making it the best pizza (and one of the best meals) we had during our trip. We ate on the balcony overlooking St. Katherine' s Dock which really added to the experience. The beast worked out well for the four of us - two adults and two kids (under 11) - and they were able to split the toppings the way we wanted - half Parma and half Margherita.The tavern on the first floor had a great selection and although each floor had its own restaurant, they said you could bring the pizza down if you wanted to eat it there.",

It took over 20 minutes for the waiter to even come over to us to take our drink order. Then, they messed up our food order... twice! It wasn't even busy! We ordered the brownie and ice cream dessert and it only came with a brownie. When we asked for the ice cream, he said \"oh, no ice cream, sorry.\" What a joke! He could have told us that before we ordered it. He also could have offered to take it off of our bill, especially since it was brought to our table and we had to point out the mistake. He knew there was a mistake, but he was obviously hoping we wouldn't catch it. We will come again, but we now know not to have the same waiter.",

    "text": "Great first impressions, well presented with all the flower boxes and overlooking St Katherine's Dock. Inside is quite large, with different food options on every floor, with a pizza restaurant, steak restaurant and pub grub on the ground floor. It was really busy when my friend and I visited as part of the pub was closed off for a wedding party. We found a table in the main bar on the ground floor and ordered some food. We both went for the ultimate beer battered fish and chips as we were really hungry (\u00a314.95). The presentation of the food was really nice, but we didn't think the portion was any bigger than expected and found we had essentially spent the extra \u00a32.00 on 1 piece of bread and some curry sauce! The food was enjoyable but nothing particularly special, it wasn't very hot when it \u00a0arrived and after hunting down some salt in the bar, were even colder when we got stuck in. Drinks weren't the cheapest, but I guess that is the area. I would still return for a drink around St Katherine's Dock, but might try the food on the upper floors instead. I would probably rate the overall experience a 3.5/5.",

This unique building is a 18th century building with a nice location setting and a lovely yacht views opposite .They used the Ground floor as a bar; first floor served the pizza and second floor serve as a grill restaurant. You can find a lovely views at the linear balcony dining area on 1st and 2nd floor; with chunky timber construction and hanging flowers and plants. it often attract a lot of tourist coming here. Pizza menu is simple and have three selection, you can go for small, large and feast size. Large size of pizzas only cost less than \u00a330. We had ordered one large cajun chicken pizza and one large spicy chorizo pizza which is perfectly done and delicious.. Alongside with these pizzas, we also have salad with melon and bread with olives, all is good. This is such a cool place to have your meal if you are not far from tower bridge. It is highly recommended and not to miss to visit it if you are tourist around that area.",

When ordering at the bar expect to be ignored if you aren't white. Standing in line right in front of the server and she will ignore you and help other patrons. Complained to the other staff members and was finally helped by someone else. Location was good next to the boats and the patrons inside were nice. Food was decent, but expect to wait for a long time. There's a monitor with orders on it at the bar so to check on your order, it's best to go there since no one else will help you. If you need to speak to servers about getting more napkins or anything else, well good luck.",
