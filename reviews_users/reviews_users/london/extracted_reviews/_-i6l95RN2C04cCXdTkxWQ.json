    "text": "This has recently changed it's name (and possibly ownership) from New Seoul to Tohbang, however no need to worry about any changes in the quality accompanying it. The staff are always smiling and friendly, the food is fantastic and served in super quick time, but not such that the food seems badly prepared and you don't feel rushed. In all it makes a great place to go for a workday lunch as you can quite easily be in and out within an hour. Starters feel a little on the pricey side - around \u00a36.40 for 6 grilled dumplings - but the main courses are better value. It's one of those places that isn't cheap, but its certainly not too expensive either, and the quality is more than worth the outlay. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Great Korean place. I shared one of the set menus for two with my dining partner and really enjoyed the variety and quantity of the food. I'd probably order the same thing again next time (there will be a next time) but make sure to drink more water. The dishes were especially spicy and extremely salty. The kimchi rocked and the fried chicken was all sorts of down home tasty. I've only been to one other Korean restaurant in London (Young Bean near London Wall). New Seoul is just as good (maybe a little better) but with a homier feel to it. One word of caution: the staircase leading down to the toilets is unusually steep and starts right on the other side of a door. Watch your step! And here's another tip: come on an empty stomach.",

    "text": "She was not very pleased. Infact she looked like the lady who got caught in the midst of my morning sneeze.I had dragged her half the way across town for a 'Toh Bang'. How very romantic!It didn't help that the front of the restaurant resembles a downtown caf\u00e9 and offers little inspiration about the experience you may have inside, you think medioacre Coffee Shop at best, and not one of those that provide the 'extras' either. But this is part of the charm. You go expecting little and come-out feeling like you have just bagged the lotto! Once you have scratched the veneer you un-earth a gem of a restaurant. If you only like dining in raucous, contemporary settings then your Bang will be more of a squirel-fart, however if you can see beyond the pale interior and slightly dull persona you will be rewarded with a firework of flavour combinations that leave the mouth feeling as though the War of '53 is still taking place.I opted, on the advice of fellow Qypers, for the intriguingly named; Yukhoe dolsot bibimbap (try saying that with a mouthful of seaweed) and even had a go pronouncing it instead of the usual bingo-calling; I'll have a number 66 please. It arrived within minutes and the lovely waitress encouraged me to mix-up the thinly sliced veg, sticky rice, almost-minced raw beef and perfectly formed raw egg yolk as if I were a mad two-year old. After augmenting with a lovely glug of chilli sauce I had my first wallop what came next was a super-tasty congealed mess of flavours; almost-naked (slightly cooked) egg, strong, rich, raw beef, sticky but delicate white rice and fresh baby veg locked in a powerful and excitable four-some! Bang! I'll definitely come again!",

It doesn't look particularly impressive from the outside, and I'd walked past without really noticing it plenty of times before a Korean friend of mine took me there for lunch one day. I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found. It is authentically Korean and the customer service is very good, although their English isn't always the best. The food, hwever, is lovely. I usually have the dolost bibimbab, which is rice, beef, a fried egg and assorted vegetables in a hot stone bowl. They also offer chilli sauce to spice things up a little and all dishes come with a free miso soup. The atmosphere is very pleasant and I've had no hesitation to take both friends and family here, either for celebrations or casual visits. One friend who spent some time living in Korea said he'd been searching for a good Korean place in London and that New Seoul was by far the best and most authentic.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews here I was really looking forward to eating here. It is quite expensive, so I had saved it for a special occasion. The menu has a lot of choice, though very few purely vegetarian dishes, but many with a vegetarian option available. I chose a (vegetarian option available) tofu and vegetable broth, and my dining partner chose prawn with noodles. The food looked amazing when it arrived, but the second thing I pulled out with my chopsticks was a prawn. There was no mention of seafood in the dish on the menu and I had asked for the vegetarian option. As mentioned in another review, the waitress spoke very little english, which would certainly explain a lot! She took my dish, stared at it for about 30 seconds and then disappeared. No explanation, nor an apology.After five minutes with my dining partner politely waiting despite her food going cold awaiting her, and with no further explanation coming from the restaurant, we walked out and went to Oriental Taste on Laystall Street. So, if you have vegetarians in your party, or even just care about getting what you ordered, avoid this place until they get their act together!Addendum: I just read this to my dining partner to make sure I was giving a fair review and she tells me there were no prawns in her prawn noodles, I guess they were all in my broth!!",

Yes, of course, the usual coke and tap water, please\".My friend and I settle into our seats and look at each other happily since we are, once again - like every week, here to enjoy one of our favorite foods. One of us having spent years in Seoul and the other being raised in Asian-focused community for the majority of her life, we come to Tohbang every week to to feed our cravings and bring back wonderful -often hilarious- memories and stories. We sit picking at and munching on our side dishes, which we can never predict as there is such a variety in side dishes at Tohbang. It has become quite a game trying to guess what they'll bring out to us. Some dishes are pickled, and others are not. We like both, but I'm sure you can let your server know whether you prefer one type over the other.Our dishes arrive in hot boiling cauldron bowls with a side of rice. The steam rises and the scent of the ingredients and heat hit us. We dig in. No talking, just eating. About 5 minutes into our meal, we remember we have each other at the table, and we begin chatting away again.You'll see when you eat here that there is sometimes so much variety, there is often times inconsistency. Sometimes we'll receive two side dishes, sometimes three. Some servers let you order to your liking, and others won't be the least bit flexible, even denying you of an egg in your soup. Some people like this, and some don't. \u00a0Whatever you like, though, you are sure to find at Tohbang. Although we normally order our soups every time, the dishes we've seen arrive at other table look phenomenal. It's always a lovely experience at Tohbang, and we will continue to come back for more - especially with their lunch menu at only 6.50gbp/person!",

Toh bang was a little further away and wasnt exactly where I expected to find a korean restaurant. Despite this, it did satisfy my cravings for spicy tofu soup but didn't warrant a second visit",

Starting with the end: Tohbang, you sure deserve your 5 stars!I went to Tohbang with a huge group of people and we ordered many dishes to share between all of us. I can't even say how many different dishes I had, food just kept arriving on our tables and everything was so good I just didn't seem to get full. So I ate, ate, ate, tried so many different things, ate as much spice one can humanly eat and loved every bit of it.I feel really bad about not being able to name any of these dishes, but I can assure you that from salad to meat and meat to salad, I loved the taste of everything. And I can only agree to Svenja G's warning : \"When it says \"spicy dish\", be warned, it is spicy!\" I had to eat a lot of rice to save myself from the spices at some points, but all in all didn't mind at all! I don't eat much meat and I was happy to discover that meat Tohbang style is just the way I like it!If you are into very strange tasting alcohols, you should try the fresh cucumber water (oh wait... no, it's schnaps !) Some of my friends loved it a loooot, but for my part I found it a bit confusing, so much I was sure it would be water!The waitress was also very nice, the interior very cosy and everything was made so that our groupe would have a great time.

I highly recommend the jap chae, which was really fresh, nice chewy noodle, perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Bi bim bap is also really good, though the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap doesn't get QUITE as crispy on the bottom as I want it to. My two friends and I spent over \u00a370 here, however.

As a result, discovering that there was a Korean dish called bibimbap, I instantly liked it. That and the fact it has great Jewish things in it, pickles and egg.I came to Tohbang for lunch after reading Ha's review. They have a selection of lunch specials that are all around \u00a36-7 and really filling. I was a little disappointed to discover there was no bibimbap on this selection but I ordered a rice dish with egg and snow peas (basically egg fried rice) and it was tasty. But what did impress me was the large groups of Korean kids who seem to know what they were ordering. They had a table heavy with sizzling dishes and smells that came from that direction were wonderful. I want to come back here, for dinner and really take my time. Order a selection from the menu and roll home after.It's a really lovely place, they have fabulous loos. They were super duper clean with posh soap and everything. I might actually go back just to use them.",

The very kind waitresses had to rearrange everything on our tables with every new dish arriving, as we had ordered to much and yet they always managed to accomodate everything on our table.When it says \"spicy dish\", be warned, it is spicy! Good though that one can extinguish the burning sensation with a certain schnapps, that they serve here. Unfortunately I forgot the name of it, but it is served with fresh cucumber.

    "text": "\"Just popping off for a Tohbang\" has a certain ring to it. Much better than\" going for a New Seoul\" at any rate. And to be honest, the chance to say that was all the encouragement I needed to pop along to this Korean eatery on Clerkenwell Rd. I know next to nothing about the cuisine, other than it kinda involves steamboat, bbq and, erm well, that's it really. ON the advice of my more experienced dining companions I went for somthing uniquely Korean: the intriguing Yukhoe dolsot bibimbap for instance. Somewhere between Japanese katsudon and a steak tatare, it arrived at the table in a sizzling stone bowl. Small piles of thinly sliced raw vegetables such as bean sprouts, courgette and carrots sat atop a pile of sticky rice. Crowning it all was a slivered mound of raw beef and a wibbly raw egg yolk. As instructed we covered the whole with great swirls of chilli sauce and mixed it all up with gusto. For someone who often compartmentalises the food on his plate, this was a curiously exciting thing to do (I think it should herewith be referred to as \"doing a Tohbang\"). So there I was doing a Tohbang like some demented three year high on Pepsi. And somehow managing not to spray everything within a five foot radius with globules of yolk, sticky rice and chilli sauce. And then i dove in. It tasted fabulous, surprisingly gentle in flavour, but in a hearty way. Even with the chilli sauce the flavour wasn't too strong. Almost raw beef and vegetables were all bound together with the just-cooked egg while the chilli provided an underlying heat. This is the perfect cold-day food, warming. Something I would definitely come back to. The whole thing was pretty reasonable too, with some fermeneted chilli pickled potatoes and other vegetables and a hite beer (more purile fun to be had here with \"missing\" letters), it came to \u00a313 a head. And that was for a properly filling lunch. And who knew that eating Korean, doing a Tohbang and drinking (s)hite beer could be so much fun.",

Service from the start was super disorganised. We had three tables of four joined up. Three different waiters came to take the order at staggered times and none explained that was the process. Hence once the order for 4 was taken, they walked off and left the rest of us was left not understanding what was going on. My table of four had the worst experience as our drinks did not arrive for ages then our order was clearly taken incorrectly. I received my main of kimchi stew at a reasonable time however there was only one piece of thinly sliced pork belly which was minuscule. In addition, the broth tasted watered down, hence I rejected the meal and decided to get some takeaway from pret down the road instead. In the first hour we were there, out of my three colleagues, 1 received his starter on time. 1 received a main. 1 received nothing. Even though they all ordered and starter and main each. We spoke to three waiters and the manager before they eventually bought the rest of the food out to us. Super disappointed and will not be returning. If I could give 0 stars. I would.",

I am, however, tempted to visit again and try another dish to see whether the other dishes can sway me towards a 4.Came here with a friend on the way to a concert, and, being the first ones standing around waiting for dinner to begin at 6pm, we were seated immediately. I ordered the spicy soba noodles and the rice cake starter, and friend ordered the dolsot bimbimbap. To my pleasant surprise, we received two free side orders: potatoes and the spicy pickled cucumbers. Both of these were really good, particularly the potatoes! The rice cakes weren't cooked all the way, so they were missing that soft, chewy texture I was craving, but the sauce was pretty good. The soba noodles were a bit too vinegary for my taste, but once I added the chilli sauce it was better. Unfortunately, it still wasn't the best I've had.In general, great place to satisfy a Korean food craving and wouldn't mind coming again, but not sure if it's the most authentic experience!",

I suspect the spicy flavors, in which the cuisine is famous for are played down and made much milder to appease those who aren't used to such strong flavors. I found myself reaching for the red chilli paste several times for my supposed spicy dish. Prices were a lot lower than expected for a \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 city like London.

Tohbang, you didn't deliver.I'm an Asian (living in the US, but currently have some works to do in London) and my taste palette is simply original Asian. I live in an airbnb nearby, just 4 min walk from Tohbang.Seen the good reviews on Yelp and always want to give it a try.Today, just got back from Italy weekend trip, tired of all the pastas and just need a good Asian food.I've tried all of the other nearby Asian restaurants, so I've decided to try Tohbang.It was 8.45 pm and the restaurant nearly empty (only three tables filled). The younger female waiter was really nice when taking my order. The older female waiter, however..was not that nice. Gave me my food with sour face.I ordered Galbi (and need to add white rice also because they don't include it!) and kimchi (because I've read other reviews saying that they only give 2 free banchan that are not kimchi (I cannot eat in a K-restaurant without kimchi!).To my surprise, they didn't gave me free banchan (side dishes) at all! Not two, not once, zero! In Asia and US, they gave you at the very very least two small plates! Most of the time you can refill it (at least once).I thought to myself if they've changed the rule. Well, I saw the next table (four young Korean guys) and they had banchan! Ok, they probably paid for it, but wait...when I've finished my kimchi, the older rude waiter took my plate (I thought she will refill it or finally give me the free banchan), when she came back with a small plate I was singing inside....then...she gave the small plate to the four Korean guys table!!! They were surprise and thank her. They had friendly small talk in Korean afterwards.My Galbi, was the worst that I've ever had (and I had so many all over the world!). It was to salty and lack the rich deep marinated beef flavor that Galbi usually has. The spicy sauce that they have not even spicy (which is surprising because I thought all of the K-restaurants are using the same brand of spicy sauce).The kimchi tasted like bought in a supermarket. If they make it in-house, then it's not well executed.My bill came to \u00a319. Not that much, but absolutely to much for what I ate. FYI, I ate in a random K-restaurant in Manchester (still in the UK!) and it was still better than this, plus they gave me two free banchan!If this is the best K-restaurant in London, then don't crave for Korean food while in London!",

The meat is very fresh and prepared well by the chefs -- and copious amounts of banchan to come around! The kimchi chigae also got me sweating a little bit which is always a good sign. While the flavour is not as authentic as I'm used to in places with a larger Korean immigrant population, I'm appreciative of the fact that London is more constrained in that capacity.

Tohbang is a nice little restaurant a few blocks away from my school and I thought I'd pop in for some lunch one afternoon. They have some great lunch specials for under \u00a37 which I guess is reasonable for a sit down meal in London. I keep telling myself to pretend the \"\u00a3\" sign means \"$\" so I don't feel as horrible about spending so much money... I was in between getting the bulgogi or the bibimbap, but when it came down to ordering I made the game decision for bulgogi. The texture of the meat was great, but the flavor was a bit too sweet for me. As for the side dishes, we got two different kinds of radishes. Maybe I'm expecting too much since I'm from California and when I go to a Korean restaurant, they give you anywhere from 5-10+ side dishes. When it comes down to it, Tohbang's food is okay, which isn't a bad thing at all. It's a good lunch option since they do have a variety of things on special. Service in London is so weird... I have yet to go to restaurant where I didn't have to ASK for a refill of water. Man... us Americans are on top of our sh*t (service wise).",

Or maybe their lunch size is small?Service was fine, though the server spoke so little English we could not communicate that we wanted a raw instead of a fried egg on our BiBimBap, and it took us a long time to communicate that our friend could not eat rice (for medical reasons), for which they refused to substitute. So service and size are definitely where this place loses one to two stars.The side dishes were great though, I really enjoyed them. More savory than in America where they are much more sour. The potato was lovely. I'll definitely be back soon.",

Conversely, it seems that Tohbang's popularity has also skyrocketed in the past few months to the point where one of the first questions asked upon arrival has recently become, 'Oh, did you make a booking?' Seems like business is booming!Regardless, the grub is unerringly delicious, the food comes on fast and furious, the beer is frosty, and the cucumber soju is dangerously smooth. For best results, bring an army of slaveringly hungry omnivores with you, because there's nothing like having a Korean feast of a dozen different dishes.Popular menu items for me include their pajun, dolsot bibimbap, kalbi and bulgogi, jap chae, and any of the fried dumplings (though the pork ones win extra points for deliciousness). It's worth noting that unlike many Korean restaurants, ban chan don't come gratis, so order an extra dish or two of kimchi along with a lettuce and spring onions if you plan to use them as wraps for your meat.Between the friendly folks, the reliable service, and the consistently delightful and satisfying K-cuisine, I've come to truly depend on Tohbang as a local staple in my neighbourhood oriental restaurant rotation.",

    "text": "YES. After the shit experience at Asadal, I'm glad I was able to find a different Korean restaurant with excellent service and satisfying food. After going for lunch once, I booked a table for nine on a Saturday night and there was excellent service though I could tell we were overwhelming them a bit. Might have to do with the fact that I speak Korean but who knows. Really hard working staff (UNLIKE ASADAL).Yukgaejang and kimchi jigae both filling and balanced. A friend of mine had the bibimbap and it looked/smelled delicious. Another friend had the kanpoongi and they said it was also tasty. I had a bite, it was sweet as you'd want it but all in all, just remember that you're paying London prices (not ridiculous but still) for average homemade Korean food. Luckily average Korean food is still, in my book, the superior cuisine.Will definitely be back. Regularly.",

I've recently returned to London for business and am very pleased to report that the quality of Tohbang's dishes has not diminished in the least. \u00a0I ordered a simple pork dumpling soup, radish kimchi and bulgoki, all of which were delicious. The service was also as good as I remember it, prompt and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Korean food.",

    "text": "My fellow yelper, A Liu wanted to go here, so who am i to say no? :)D\u00e9cor: Dark and dim. I can see what it was trying to achieve (a sort of classy yet comfortable atmosphere), but I wasn't particularly a fan. I like the rustic Korean look with brighter lights better, but eh, personal preference. It is a small place though, so if you can do reservations beforehand, do!Service: It was fine, nothing to complain too much about. There was a large group when we went so service was a little slow, but it was fine. Oh and I love how we were greeted at the door with a big smile by the lady- big rosy smile put a smile on our faces!Food: I got a Tofu Soup dish (The ones that come in a hot stone bowl and rice on the side). Mine was quite delicious, spot-on!- My friends got a Bibimbap, which she found quite good and another friend got a (forgot the name) Korean fried rice combo in a hot stone bowl which smelled veryveryvery good (we stole a couple of bites since he said he was 'full'. Hehe)- Oh and they do give you those little Korean appetizers beforehand. Though their 3 dishes doesn't compare to the usual (At least) 5-6 dishes I get back home.Bottom Line: It's good food and for a 'classier' environment to eat Korean food, it's good. But IMHO, I thought it was a bit expensive for what I got. Call me a cheap-o, but hey, I am still a college student!",
