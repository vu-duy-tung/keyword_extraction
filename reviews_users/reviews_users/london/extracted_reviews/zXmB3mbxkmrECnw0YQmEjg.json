Like wagamama, the menu is a hodge-podge of SE Asian dishes, and like wagamama (and most other places I've tried in the UK), tends towards the heavy and oily, instead of fiery and fresh. The ginger stir-fry I tried fell into the same old trap, but some of the other dishes looked more promising. The fresh combi-juices on the drinks menu are a good option too. It's far from 'authentic', but it's also far from terrible. Decent (and generously sized) considering the price, and probably the best cheap option near the Angel. Just stay away from the stir-fries.",

You feel as though you're being used as a tool to trick other people into coming in, especially when this positioning means you are physically separated from the other few customers. This was exactly what happened to us when we arrived at the Banana Tree Canteen. Even though there were ten or twelve people at the other side of the restaurant, we were cast aside like lepers. Nonetheless, our meal at the Banana Tree was actually quite nice. My boyfriends' beef noodles were fairly tasty and my blacked pork and rice stir fry was was also nice although a bit too sweet for my liking. The portions were enormous and I hardly dented the mountain of rice on my plate. I couldn't help thinking this meal for two would easily have fed three of four. Atmospherically the Banana Tree lacks a bit by comparison to London's great selection of Thai restaurants. The grey and brown colour scheme hasn't done anything to warm the room and the cold walk downstairs to the toilet is a bit creepy. This is not the kind of place I would organise a meal out to although I would recommend it if you happen to be walking by and fancy a very filling feast.",

    "text": "Banana Tree is one of those Asian canteen style restaurants which seem to be found on every street corner in London; you know, the ones that serve a selection of dishes from countries like Indonesia, China, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam all in the same place. I've always found this concept a bit odd, as you don't really get 'European' restaurants which serve a bit of French, some Italian, some Greek, some Spanish and a Swedish meatball option for good measure, because the cuisines are so different, and yet these Asian styles are also markedly different but get lumped together, often with poor results. Luckily Banana Tree manages to do a pretty good job of covering the bases but producing good tasting food. Of course some dishes were better than others; I'm now addicted to the spicy aubergine, which was half a roasted aubergine smothered in a smoky sauce and chilli flakes, and the yellow chicken curry had great depth of flavour and a very generous portion size. The stirfries were less successful, as the sauces had that disappointing gluey texture all too often found in bad Chinese takeaways, although at least they were packed with vegetables and meat. The juices were really fresh, and the service was speedy, although as there were only 4 other people in the restaurant when we popped in that's not too surprising. Islington has a Wagamama in the N1 centre but I think this is definitely a better option, as the prices are better and the food has much more flavour, so if you're looking for a quick Asian bite before heading out in Angel then this is the place to try.",

Don't be mistaken, the food is not bad, but it's not good either. I ordered the phad thai and it was good, but \u00a0really spicy.

The restaurant itself is pretty souless, and there are an awful lot of places in London where you can get better Thai/Malaysian/Singaporean (I refuse to use the term asian fusion!). It lives up to the 'Canteen' title - but it's far better than Wagamama, which is the closest thing I can compare it to. I think this might just be because they also scribble on your paper place mats. The food's completely different. Then again, it never promised anything more and so I will be perfectly happy to go there once weekly for a massive bowl of coconut soup, one friend will have the noodles, another will have the other soup, and another will have the lamb curry.... everyone's full and contented.

I had it with sticky rice which is served in banana leaves which is a nice touch. Overall, it's not a traditional Asian restaurant, so if you're looking for authentic Asian food I'd go elsewhere, but it's good Asian fusion food for a reasonable price.",

    "text": "I've gone to Banana Tree a few times already due to its proximity to my work so feel like a review is overdue. From some of these reviews, I'm surprised people are harping on its authenticity. To me, I immediately took it as an Asian fusion restaurant and I think Banana Tree achieves that. I've gotten the Legendary Rendang, the Roast Duck Curry, and the Bun Bo Meaty Salad Bowl. My favorite of the three is the roast duck curry as it combines two of my favorites: duck and curry. The Legendary Rendang was my least favorite as the beef was a little dry and the rice was overcooked. I also add the spring rolls which were tinier than I expected given its price.My friends who I've gone with have gotten the BananaTree Laksa which one of them LOVED and another ordered the Phad Thai which my friend said was average.I will give props to the plating/presentation of each dish as they're beautifully arranged and it is indeed large and hearty portions so you won't leave hungry. The food can be hit or miss so find your favorite dish here and keep on ordering it on subsequent visits.",

My last visit was more than a year ago and to be honest \u00a0it must have not been memorable because I don't remember what I ate back then! If it were good I would have remembered :-)This time around I went for the lunch menu - had the Chicken Dumplings and a Chicken Rendang. The dumpling arrived quickly and were OK and nothing exceptional. There was bit of a wait for the main. The portion sizes were OK. The chicken (thighs) was cooked perfectly and the gravy was interesting. Cost wise it was \u00a37.85 for the Rendang and \u00a32.95 for the dumplings + 10% service charge.Their drinks menu looked quite interesting but I skipped, I wanted to try out the Lychee Mojito as it looked nice. Overall food wise this gets a three star from me but the other aspects has earned a one star, particularly the way I was treated during a very busy lunch time.The staff were attentive provided me with a choice of seat in spite of being busy and topped up water when it ran low. Upon enquiring whether they offer a local business discount they gave me a buy one get one free voucher as they didn't have any other discount scheme. Good selection of Pan Asian dishes and I recommend you do try this next time you are in Islington, it is a short walk from the Angel tube.",

    "text": "The last time I went to a Banana Tree it was in Watford. I really enjoyed it and was disappointed when they closed the branch. The restaurant in Angel is well situated for those going to Sadler's Wells and the staff are well aware of the different events happening nearby (there's a sign by the till with all the details).I came with three friends and brought my Taste card which permits 2 for 1 on starters, mains, sides etc. but only for two people so we effectively got 1 person for free. Very happy :)The service was a bit odd. We seemed to have 3 waitresses which meant there was no coordination. We arrived before 6 so we thought we'd take advantage of happy hour and order some cocktails but Waitress 1 came back and said the till wouldn't accept the order (5:55pm fail). We accepted her apologies and said we'd look at the drinks again and order with our food. Waitress 2 came for our order and she told me I'd get 2 for 1 on mocktails (I tried to explain it might not be possible but was happy either way). Five minutes later Waitress 3 came with our original 2 for 1 cocktails! Woohoo! We asked he to ensure the other drinks were cancelled and we were happy to get our original choice. Then Waitress 2 comes over with the second drinks order.... my my, it gets so confusing and I can only imagine this makes little sense to read.The food was alright. I remembered that Beef Randang to be better when I last had it, but it was certainly not bad. I was adequately full by the end of the meal (using a Combo) and I'd go back again if I was near Angel. I know the starters are good but didn't have any on this occasion.",

Unauthentic, stodgy and failed the Asian test. Since then, I've been working across the street from the one on St John Street and I have to say, it's now... Ok. Do I hate myself for dragging my sorry calories through the door of a place that says 'Indochinese Kitchen'? Yes. Why? Because the food of each of the countries is so different there isn't any way someone could make all of it well. Sadly, this truth does extend also to Banana Tree. Food here is tasty. It's what you'd imagine food from South East Asia would taste like. My go to when I need some reminiscing is the Mee Goreng on the lunch menu. It does taste like home. Service at this particular store can be hit or miss. Miss when it gets really busy, hit when it's quiet. I feel a little less ashamed now to step through these doors, because yes, if you wanted cross S.E. Asian cuisine, this is one of the places that does it decently well outside of Soho/Chinatown. *shrug* Reluctant - South East Asian pride hurting 3*.",

    "text": "I believe if you order the right thing Banana Tree can be good. But it's not like I've been here before to judge myself but heard too many people complaining about the bland flavours of the wok dishes. Most chain Chinese restaurants do lack that skill to give wok dishes that needed wok energy as it requires time for the wok to heat up and dealing with a very high temperature wok that can be dangerous if you are not used to it. Therefore to keep it safe I went for a Laksa which is hard to get wrong whilst my friend went the Pak Choi Noodle Soup. \u00a0My Laksa was actually very good, very mild so not for those who are looking for the more authentic and spicy version. It is slightly more sweeter than the ones I've had in other Singaporean and Malaysian's restaurant but with me having a sweeter tooth I enjoyed it a lot. It was fragrant, perfectly seasoned and a good depth and thickness to it to cling on the noodles as I was slurping them. The noodles were the average egg noodles, cooked perfectly to remain that bouncy soft texture and I enjoyed the crunches of the beansprouts alongside each bite. The deep fried tofu were also great after soaking up the creamy broth which really added to the taste of it. If anything the portion of noodles was a bit small but good if you're planning to have starters and sides it was a good amount. I was using a Tastecard to get 2 for 1 anyway so it was a bargain.As expected my friend's vegetarian broth in her noodle soup lacked that depth and was quite bland. It is hard to get a vegetarian broth rich as it does require a lot more time to extract all the flavours of the vegetables for a naturally sweet broth. But still the variety of ingredients like the pak choi, carrot gratings and deep fried tofu really gave it's natural flavour to the dish- like a salad, light with delicate flavours.Dessert is a must here. Although I doubt the chocolate sauce in the chocolate fondant was suppose to be thick inside I actually enjoyed the chewy texture it gave instead. I think it wasn't heated enough for the chocolate to melt inside but nevertheless it was a nice indulgent treat with the ice cream slowly melting in for that creamy combination. But the highlight of it all was the Balinese 'Pulut Hitam' Pudding- warm black rice, al dente with a generous amount of coconut cream on top to smooth it all out, cooled with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream that also gave it the slight sweetness and flavour it needed. It was sooooo good I wished there was more of it. A nice mint for presentation and sesame seeds sprinkled on top for that punch of nutty flavour. Banana Tree is a easy-going chain restaurant, a simple but nice looking wooden decor, dimmed lighting for that perfect atmosphere to catch with friends for dinner. It is comfortable and service was good. Menu seems to cater for everyone. Overall a good dinner based on what I ordered. Will hopefully be able to try the other dishes to review them as well.",

    "text": "I have had a Tastecard for a couple of years now and I keep on forgetting to use it. Whilst, it gives you access to discounts at the run of the mill chains, it does also give you some independent surprises local to wherever you may be in London.Following the back to work Monday blues, I grabbed my mate and we headed to Upper Street for some exciting food shopping (yes, I am being sarcastic). Following our hunt around Waitrose and Sainsbury's, it was time to get some food in our bellies. Surprise! For once, I remembered I had may Tastecard and opened up the app for a search for local treats. We opted for Banana Tree, just down the road from Angel station.This particular Banana Tree is noisy, not sure if it is the layout, acoustics or whatever, but it can be consuming. Good or bad thing, depends on your mood. For starter I had half a grilled aromatic aubergine with caramel sauce, fresh herbs and crispy shallots. Wow, the sweet sauce blended well with this fruit. Ksymena opted for steamed chicken dumplings in fresh herb sauce which was not too tough. For mains, we went for the Grill Combo, I had the Chicken Jawa and Ksymena had the Blackened Chilli Pork. Both servings of meat were tasty and well-seasoned. For an extra cost, you could add aromatic spiced rice, spicy green papaya salad with crushed nuts and viet cracker. The Pork was marinated in aromatic dark soy, palm sugar and chilli, while the chicken was immersed in Javanese spices.The portions were full-on and full of flavour. For drinks it was sparkling water and a glass of wine. We also had a cappuccino and double espresso.With the Tastecard, we received 2-4-1 on food, so the final bill came to a very pleasant \u00a335.10 (inc service charge). That is an average of \u00a317 each, which is great value for what we had. Two things here to note, 1) Banana Tree is not the best in Asian cuisine, but is good as a local option if you live near one and 2) get yourself a Tastecard and USE IT. There are deals to be had, mostly Monday thru Thursday.",

Not a hard and fast rule...but, surely if mom's old recipe gets passed down from generation to generation to restaurant family, ish is gonna be good. Right? Right. A pal and I stopped in to Banana Tree one evening for dinner, and it was totally and perfectly fine. The service smiley, prompt. The beers cold. The food hot (and fast!). It's totally acceptable. But it didn't blow my mind. By any stretch. Skip the pho (seriously, pho is an art) and get the rengang (my pal said it was quite good). Optional upgrade for \u00a33 gets you rice, crackers and salad with your main order...good deal. Wash it down with a Singha or Tiger beer!It's not the best and its not the worst.

It's not even real Thai - it's just mediocre and not worth a trip.The food doesn't have much taste and isn't spiced right at all. At least the stir-frys are like that. The way they are described, you'd think it would be packed with flavor, but you can't really barely taste any of the flavors described. The portions are small, rice is incredibly expensive (but it seems to be that way every where in this city), and it's not a place I'd seek out again.On a Tuesday evening, there was a pretty good crowd around dinner time, but no wait. Ambiance is not bad, but very chain like - not personally charming. Seats are not convenient because you can't sit with your back resting on the booth. It's placed too far from the table, so you constantly have to lean forward.Wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "The four of us visited Banana Tree for the first time as I had been craving for Asian cuisines for so long and we were not disappointed! We arrived around 7pm which is supposed to be the busiest time for a restaurant and most tables were full already, we briefly waited for 10 mins to be seated and I am very happy with that! We took some cocktails to start with, my Lychee mojito was refreshing and tasty. Then we ordered 4 starters : Crispy seafood money bags, sticky Thai wings, fresh Indo herb wraps and Satay sticks. We loved each one of them. Personally the chicken wings and satay sticks were my favorites but if you prefer lighter flavors to start with, go for the wraps! The dip can really open your appetite, and I like putting a touch of their house chili paste to spice it up a little, yummy! As for the mains, we ordered : tamarind spicy aubergine combo, the legendary rendang with beef combo, laksa and blackened chili pork. My beef rendang was absolutely amazing and cooked to perfection, really tender and the balance of the flavor was on point. To be honest at this point we were so full but we couldn't stop! I've never tried corn cakes before and these little crispy balls are lovely and tasty. After the main we ordered another round of drinks and then, desserts!! Yeah we always have our second stomach with us for desserts! So we took the Banana 'Frotiteroles' and Coconut stuffed green Thai pancakes to share. Pandan and coconut always go well with each other and Jesus I love the coconut ice cream with sesame on top!! Overall we were just more than happy with our first Banana Tree experience. Isti, the assistant manager was very fun and knowledgeable, also patient as we were struggling with decisions. Very prompt service and we didn't need to wait for too long for the dishes. The restaurant was clean(toilet as well, thank god) and the vibe is good. Relaxing atmosphere to have a chat with friends. Before I go I did read some negative comments about them earlier this year and I feel they have really taken it on board and made a change. The food is amazing and service is great for me. I've never given such a long review but Banana Tree Angel def serves it!",

    "text": "I came here on Saturday night with a friend before catching a film at Vue Islington. It's only a few steps away from Angel station and relatively close to the theatre, so ideal for a quick bite. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated immediately, though the restaurant was reasonably full. I ordered the beef rendang as a combo, which means that for \u00a33.50 extra it comes with rice, salad, corn cakes, and rice crackers. I can't imagine not doing the combo because the rice itself is \u00a32.50, which is a bit of a rip off. The food came within about 5 minutes. I wasn't the greatest fan of the rendang, and it didn't seem like much of a curry when it was a few large chunks of meat and a very thick dark brown sauce. I also got an orange/carrot juice, which interestingly enough, came in a glass with orange juice on the bottom half of the glass and carrot juice on the top half of the glass, literally not blended at all. That's not made fresh to say the least! For dessert, we got the chocolate fondant with coconut ice cream, and a Vietnamese coffee, which were both ok but not great. In fact, everythingwas pretty mediocre at the restaurant, including the service, and it feels like a cheap chain restaurant. There are definitely much better options in Islington.",

    "text": "bland pan-Asian food for British taste buds. Better than Wagamama worse than Sainsburys sauce in jar. Cocktails were terrible with none of the complexities of a real cocktail. Tasted like cordial. Beef randang was stringy and the sauce too heavy. Monk vegetables tasted like crap which is amazing as I don't get how you can fuck up monk vegetables. Spring rolls had no flavour and dropping with oil. If you're the type of Slapper that like wagamamas you'll be at home here. Nice loud environment with sterile furnishings. For everyone else save yourself the effort and get a microwave dinner instead.",

    "text": "Superlative is the word!I got the 'Ying Yang' Laksa, \u00a38.6. It was fine. Noodle, noodle, coriander meatball (admittedly tasty) and more noodle. A standard tasty coconut milk curry broth, flourishes of aubergine and tofu. Not that much food. At \u00a35 perhaps a bargain. After 'optional' service charge at Banana Tree....inessential spending.Right, but that's just the contextual starter for this dialogue. The main course is:*Gaeng Keo Wan*'Aromatic Thai curry cooked with green spice paste, sweet basil, lime leaves, peppers, bamboo shoots & coconut milk'....with tofu, \u00a37.2.'Do you want rice [steamed white, \u00a32.5] with that?' asked the waiter.'No,' answered my companion. 'Just the curry.''Are you sure - it IS curry!''Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.'\u00a37.2That's 83.7% the price of my dish. What appeared, however, was not even quantifiable. It was magnificent. SUPERLATIVE.It was: THE least generous food offering I have ever been party to. Oh. my. The bowl was about the size one would expect to find two scoops of double fudge ice cream.Except that would have been more food. It's not that the present splash of thin diarrhoeic sauce was missing the visual aspect of coconut milk one associates with a 'Thai curry' \u00a0- I didn't taste it, there could have been something to that - it's that I could have disgorged its entire collection of solid contents with one grasp of my fist. There was nothing to it! It was meagre apotheosised! I was overjoyed.'Is something wrong?' asked the waiter.'Um...is this IT?''Yes, it's a curry.''I mean, I expected a little more. This is...''Yes, it's a curry, that's why I asked if you wanted rice [steamed white, \u00a32.5].''...''I can get you something else.'And so, we didn't go away hungry (actually, we kind of did - even after my comparatively reasonable dish, I was ravenous within two hours). But we did go away mystified and thoroughly unsatisfied with Banana Tree. In the objective sense. Me, I'm kinda turned on by the idea of bringing along four or five unsuspecting friends and ordering up a round of curries. How would THAT stimulus dynamise the situation!? Banana Tree, you got the menu-redesign team ready?",
