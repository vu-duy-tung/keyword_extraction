    "text": "Fast and healthy 'fast food', perfect to go to for a brief break in between shopping around Carnaby Street area, or simply to enjoy a simple, no fuss bite to eat. Their breakfast food is served until 11am and there is a separate Lunch and Dinner menu. The lunch menu goes from 11 am to 6pm serving a choice of wrap (Mexican salsa chicken, aioli chicken), salads and a vegetable or meat soup (which changes daily). The dinner menu is very similar to the lunch one but with a few more extra dishes. Food in the evening also served on plates, where as during the lunch hours everything is a lot more casual. I tried one of their meaty soups which came with a piece of Greek flatbread which was handy for dunking into the sop and wiping up any left overs. The soup was warm and surprisingly filling, and I accompanied it with one of their flourless 'Better Brownies', made out Valhrona chocolate which is 70% cocoa. All if which was washed down with a large cup of steaming green tea.",

WOAH.They are amazing. As are most of the dishes, I always go for a pick and mix of lots, it seems to work out cheaper and more filling than just one main meal. The houmous is good as are the chicken pieces. Not a fan of the raw foods salad however, I am a human, not a rabbit. Also, the 'healthy' cakes are really good, but probably not so healthy. Better than a mars bar anyway.Leon is opening up more and more stores at the moment, I hope that is not going to ruin it's thus far great reputation in serving up delicious nutritious fast food at reasonable prices.",

I have been 'ignored' by staff here, as were a group of us on another occasion. On yet another occasion, the service ended with the words 'get out' as the food was thrust at me. All quite mystifying as my rule as a customer is to assume a polite demeanour. I accept that it is a fast food place so at busy times fast turnover is the rule, but there is no excuse for extraordinary rudeness. I've stopped going there as a result.",

'Oh great, a healthy, affordable, inventive, seasonal way of eating out without the fuss associated with most sit-down restaurants.' \u00a0Leon is fun, colourful and the staff are helpful. I especially liked getting an email from Leon last year inviting me to a free tasting of their new autumn menu in their Strand outlet, beers included. Either me or someone I'm with (on my recommendation) almost always gets the sweet potato falafel when we visit. The same goes for the homemade lemonade and the apple and ginger-flavoured 'winter warmer'. So why on earth do I never go here anymore? If I can guess, it's something to do with the predictability of the place. The decor tries to be quirky but ends up looking virtually the same in every restaurant. And I struggle to name any other dish apart from the falafel, the chicken wings and the chicken salad... I would feel ridiculous giving Leon anything other than four stars, just make sure you don't visit here too much!",

I mean it just looked like a salad I made at home with whatever was in my fridge. But whatever getting past my snootiness over presentation it tasted good.MUST TRY the lemon ginger crunch.

Plus, there's practically no wait at all.That's the difference here, it's like fast food without the grease.This morning I was naughty and had a bacon roll, which comes in a whole-wheat crunchy bap with perfectly cooked bacon (*proper* bacon! Not McDonalds 'bacon') and homemade ketchup! Divine! Small enough not to feel guilty, large enough to fill a hole. I also had a black coffee and water, so the total came to \u00a35.40. Not bad at all. That's probably what I'd pay for a Starbucks (and feel not only hungry but on a sugar low just an hour later).I've also had a sweet potato falafel wrap here before (a little big, but pretty good) - and they do takeaway curries and stews as well.Sitting outside at 9.00am is lovely when the sun's out, with Carnaby Street a stone's throw away. It's metal patio furniture and wobbly tables ahoy, but for a catch up with someone you're just going to natter away to with little pause for breath, it's perfect.",

The place is usually quite busy, obviously it's Carnaby Street, but the fresh sandwiches and tasty juices are more than enough to keep you satisfied.A brilliant little shopping break if you need it, highly recommended.",

    "text": "Plenty has already been said about Leon, but there are a few things that I would like to add. I do love the concept of this place - there are too many unnecessarily expensive restaurants which value style over substance popping up in London, and far too many chains where the food might as well have been created in a petri dish because there are no nutrients left. It is for these reasons that I value Leon. The concept of fresh, seasonal and primarily organic food is much needed in London. A couple of weeks ago, when I was feeling run down, and my pockets were feeling empty, I popped into Leon and picked up a Superfood special - a mackerel superfood dish, a juice and an apple for \u00a34.95. The food was delicious, so no complaints there. I will say though, that I want to keep an eye on Leon, I sincerely hope that it does not follow the formula of other expanding restaurants where the prices go up in direct correlation to the sizes of the meals shrinking, and most importantly the quality of the food decreasing. I have heard a few, but not many whispers about this with Leon. For now I will say that I think the quality is still as good as the day when it first started.",

I have finally found my very favourite lunch in the area surrounding my office, and it a mere 45 seconds from my desk. I started off getting the aioli chicken wrap with no pickles, but then decided to be totally cheeky and see if they would make me a special one with halloumi instead of chicken. OMIGOD. OH. EM. GEE. Seriously? Bestthingever. I can't imagine it is terribly good for the waistline, but jeez is it delicious. I went back the next day and got the same lady at the cash register, and she smiled and asked \"Your special halloumi ailoi wrap again, madam?\" I hope she remembered my order because she's nice and not because I am one of those horrible customers ruined forever by the Starbucks-customization-entitlement-complex which makes one feel entitled to make ridiculous demands of all subsequent coffee shops and lunch spots. Whatever the case, every time I've gone into this shop since that day, I've gotten my same girl who has remembered my stupid special order without flinching, and been so nice about my ridiculous demands.I've never had a single bad thing at Leon. Their curry boxes are amazing, their wraps are to die for, and their dinnertime selection includes THE BEST EFFING CHORIZO IN HISTORY. I hate ginger, and I even love their lemon-ginger bars.Oh, and my very favourite part of Leon? An adorable, friendly, chipper, smiley, sandy-blonde, darling little gap-year kid named Lane working at the counter, who is from a teeny, obscure little town in California, 20 MILES FROM MY OWN LITTLE TEENY, OBSCURE HOMETOWN IN CALIFORNIA. And our names effing rhyme. I can't get over him. I totally heart Lane.I super duper wish I could afford to go here more often. I loves me some Leon.",

In fact, we were really quite impressed! The staff was helpful, considering we had never been here before and the options were really enticing. We decided on the Thai Green Curry Chicken and the Sweet Potato Falafel. Both were really great choices, very tasty, and with substantial portions for the price.

My favorite part is that they have all sorts of gluten free desserts: brownies, traybakes, and even pecan pie!

    "text": "Leon is the best! \u00a0It's the greatest \"fast food\" there is, so fresh and healthy. \u00a0We came late after a day of walking around, and I enjoyed the Chargrilled Chicken Superfood Salad which had tons of fresh, yummy veggies and a nice herbal flavor. \u00a0The crushed pea salad and superfood quinoa pot made great sides for us to share - you can easily split one of them between two people, and there were four of us. \u00a0My parents and fianc\u00e9 loved their food as well, the Moroccan Meatballs are always a hit. \u00a0The servers were so nice too - my mom somehow charmed the server so much that she gave us free dessert - Billionaire's shortbread and a brownie! \u00a0And they were AMAZING so after all that healthy food, feel free to indulge on desserts, they are worth it (esp. when free. \u00a0haha.)This is a small location, but it isn't just a storefront. \u00a0They have seating round the back and on a small patio when the weather is nice. \u00a0Great place for a quick, cheap, fresh meal.",

    "text": "Easily my favourite 'fast - food' in central London, I've had the chicken & chorizo club box nearly every time I went but I've tried also their salmon and their meatballs and everything is always so tasty. \u00a0Their baked fries nicely complement any meal and if you like garlic you can't not dip them into the aioli sauce! I wish this particular branch were a bit more spacious in regards to seats but it's perfect for quick lunch dates and take out. \u00a0Oh, and if you like your brownie every now and then make sure to grab their loyalty card!",

Like a healthy McDonalds! Food delicious could eat this food every day. Must start cooking it too! Highly recommended for super healthy fast food. Until next time.",

    "text": "No time but want to get a healthy meal on the go? No my friend the only option out there is not a boring McDonald's so called \"salad\"? Go to Leon. \u00a0You wait in line and then have the option to take away or sit in (limited seating). Leon offers a variety of choices from breakfast (porridges, eggs) to lunch/dinner (soups, burgers, fries, wraps, salads, hot boxes) all with healthy ingredients (mackerel, sweet potatoes, halloumi, quinoa). One star off because I am a soup fan especially in this freezing winter and I wish they had bigger portions and more choices. But that is really up to me.In a nutshell: fast-food can actually be fast-healthy food",

The meat was delicious in combination with the egg but I was 50/50 on the sauce. Toast is toast and the coffee was similar to anywhere on the high street.But where Leon excelled was the atmosphere. The server and chef were friendly, both to me and each other and it was all very relaxed. They were playing some absolute tunes, think The Specials - Blank Expression. I sat reading my book and felt peaceful, it was awesome.",
