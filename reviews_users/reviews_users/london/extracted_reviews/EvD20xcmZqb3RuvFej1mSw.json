    "text": "Indian-influenced fine dining in Old Westminster Library, Intriguing enough! A large business group looking for a nice place to eat, some of us wanted Indian food, others don't really eat Indian food, so this place seemed to be a very happy compromise -- haute cuisine with a hint of Indian flavour, exquisite presentation, and gracious service. Not to mention the uniquely interesting location and interior decoration that other Yelpers have already commented on. The food is quite tasty, albeit not authentic (the restaurant website uses the description \"Beyond Authentic\"). Amongst the dishes enjoyed by our group, there were tandoori breast of Anjou squab pigeon, skate wing, sea bass in goan curry sauce, Hyderabadi style lamb. The menu is not extensive but it changes frequently, if not daily, so the desired outcome is that you will always find something interesting enough to try. The price is quite reasonable for this type of establishment and in this area of London, especially if you can get there during the time that set menu is being offered (2 courses for \u00a319 or 3 courses for \u00a322). All in all, a nice place to go to for its location/ambience/service and Indian-influenced fine dining. Obviously don't go there if you are looking for hardcore authentic Indian food.",

    "text": "I had wanted to try this place for awhile - Indian fine dining in a British Library! C'mon it's appealing and intriguing. So I lucked out when I was invited to a Private Dining event at this restaurant by a friend.This is a special occasion type of place, not your casual average curry house! Don't go here expecting chicken tikka masala, Balti or Pillau - this is Indian Fusion at its best!The room looked beautiful, the service was friendly but unobtrusive and the food was excellent. The interior is elegant, warm and Old-world chic.I enjoyed a good meal, however did find it a bit overpriced -good thing I didn't have to pay for it.Edit: If you are feeling adventurous try the deer, rabbit or pheasant. Othwise the chicken, prawns and Wagyu Beef are pretty good!",

    "text": "Hmmm... My experience of the Cinnamon Club is rather different from most of those here, so I'll get straight to the point! The interior is indeed impressive, having once been a library, this two-storey room does provide a unique ambience. The food is Anglo-Indian in true fusion style, and there's no doubt that you can get some rich and unique flavours. Whether you actually like something like Massala Mash will be up to you - expect the innovative rather than classic Indian cooking. Personally, I find the offerings a bit hit and miss, and the vegetarian selection disappointing for an Indian restaurant. Some dishes really are very good, but others rather less so. The wine list is very good indeed, at a price. The price: I've not tried the \u00a322 early-bird menu, which sounds like a very good deal, and probably the best way to sample the food. If you go a la carte, expect to pay \u00a360 a head or more - plus service. Go for an above-average bottle of wine and I'd budget on \u00a375 a head. And that is my main gripe. For this amount of money, I have not been impressed with the quality of service. On my last visit, my starter arrived before I had finished my (actually rather nice) 'free' appetiser, which was unceremoniously whisked away before I had finished it, and without being asked. I found this absolutely astonishing. And the waiters seemed a little sniffy throughout - again not what I expect for this amount of money (or for any amount of money, actually). So, good marks for the food and surroundings, but three overall taking into account value for money and service.",

    "text": "My friend was sad. I decided to take her out to dinner to cheer her up. Problem was, I was also broke. But no matter - there was a great deal at Pizza Express. Unfortunately, my friend (of expensive taste and one never to miss out on an opportunity for free food) had already booked us into the Cinnamon Club. 'Don't worry,' she said, 'I've got a TopTable special!'. In order to qualify for this (2 courses with Bellini for \u00a319 or 3 courses for \u00a322) we had to be seated by 6.30. As I don't finish work until 6pm in North London, I duly arrived at 6.40, a giant ball of sweatiness and immediately felt intimidated by my 'rah' surroundings. It didn't help that as I sat down with my friend her first words were 'Ha! you look like a nurse.'*yay*The surroundings are beautiful - wood-panelled walls, a balcony dining area and crisp white table cloths. And quiet... Admittedly it was fairly early and therefore not too busy but you did feel awkward speaking at anything above a hushed whisper. Anyway, onto the important bit - the food! The Set Menu was limited - 3 choices for Starter, 3 for Main and 3 for pud. And it was a different Set Menu on their website from which I'd dribbled over earlier that day. I ordered the Grilled Plaice and Lamb Chops. Grilled Plaice was delicious, definitely more so than my friend's 'M&S' style tandoori chicken chunks. The Lamb chop was good although the portion was decidedly too little! My friend had the mullet which looked and tasted divine. The Bellini was most exquisite - it tasted of spice and exoticness. \u00a0I could have easily made my way through a pitcher. My only alarming moment was when the waiter snuck up on me until his face was pretty much 3 inches from mine and asked 'DESSERT?'. I almost punched him. All in all, the food was pretty tasty if a little on the small side, the atmosphere was rather hushed, and it was pretty expensive, even with our TopTable offer. An additional glass of wine and side dish bumped up our bill by \u00a320. I'd go again, just as long as someone else was paying! For me, it's def a special occasion visit.",

I GUARANTEE you that if you get lunch here mid-week you'll see at least one cabinet minister. After all, Cinnamon Club is sandwiched between ministries and it's much more patriotic to be seen eating Indian food than French or Japanese. Such is our perverted world.You dine in a beautiful old hall lined two-floors high with books on all walls. The lighting is good and it's real excellent white tablecloth service through and through (as you'd expect from the high prices). It's worth also visiting the dungeon-like basement which has a small but stylish cocktail lounge. So far, so good. But what of the food? Almost a decade ago Michelin made it the world's first Indian starred restaurant and Gordon Ramsay isn't shy at telling everyone how much he loves the cuisine here, but I found it underwhelming. My lamb dish lacked the sucker-punch I expected of sub-continent cooking and the mouthfuls I filched from my lunchmates solidified my thoughts... if you come in here thinking of the rich flavours and tastes of Indian food you'll only be disappointed, if you come in here having spent the last month dining on the bland subtleties of French food you'll love it.",

We started with (me) Breast of Partridge in pickling spices it was a little over cooked and tough to eat but still a wonderful taste to it and gorgeously presented. Husband had the plaice fillets with spiced crab which he really enjoyed. For main course I had the sea bass with chickpeas and green mango, wouldn't go mad about it but it was again beautifully presented. Husband had the saddle of deer in sesame and Tamarind sauce a little tough in parts but he thoroughly enjoyed it and the little bit I forced him to let me try was really tasty lol. The desserts were AMAZING!! I had the warm chocolate mousse with white chocolate icecream.. perfect and a chocoholics dream! My husband had the lemon tart with iced lemon cream and loved every mouthful! We were brought a THIRD dessert as a treat for our anniversary to share complements of the restaurant.. it was some kind of kittle sponge with a toffee type sauce and cinnamon ice cream.. very yummy AND a thin slab of dark chocolate with 'Happy Anniversary' piped on to it.. a really lovely touch and welcome suprise! The service was fantastic, every member of staff so friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The surroundings are beautiful, it's an amazing old building.

    "text": "Really fantastic upmarket indian food, set in the Old Westminster Library. Totally wonderful and grand-feeling dining.We took some friends from New York here for dinner, and all four of us loved the food. I think my favourite thing about the meal was the dessert, though! It was a really interesting combination of three different Indian-flavour-inspired things. Dessert is not a course I normally associate with Indian food, but my mind was changed after coming here.Basically, the standard of the food, quality of the service and all-round pleasant-ness of the experience is equal to the Cinnamon Club's prices. And that's always a good thing to find.",

    "text": "There are times only a curry will do.Those times when you're hung over and you want to create a commotion in your mouth. To purge your body through fiery sweat of all the ills inside.To comfort and sooth your aching bones with the magical lubricant that is ghee.To gorge yourself silly with mad flavours and three too many side dishes. And poppadums.Warning. The Cinnamon Club isn't for those times.There's no gorging here. No poppadums either. No flock wallpaper or piped music. No lurid picture of a waterfall where the water moves magically. The menus aren't laminated and the sauces aren't the colour of nuclear fusion. Personally I'm a sucker for all that stuff you get at your local curry house. But I'm also a sucker for everything the Cinnamon Club has to offer.The missus and I had been once before, about 10 years ago, and loved it. But we never find ourselves in Victoria much, hence the gap.Well, after a morning at Westminster Abbey, we thought it was time to go back, so we strolled down.First off, the building. A grand place. An old library with plenty of space, lots of crisp linen and sparkling glass. The welcome is warm but at the same time formal enough for you to know you're coming to dine, not gorge.Next the menu. A la cart dishes to make the mouth water and the eyes water too when you see the price. No vindaloo, no CTM (the most popular dish in the country so we're told). We plumped for the set lunch menu which had plenty of choice.To start we had a mackerel fillet which had a beautifully balanced spice rub on it before being delicately steamed and fried (I think). Delicate flavours every one. Personally I prefer a well burnished skin on my mackerel but this would have defeated the point of the dish. It was accompanied by a mustard sauce which worked ever so well. It complimented the fish rather than overpowering it. The other starter was tender pieces of chicken, again beautifully spiced and served with a yoghurt that set if off well. It was close to tandoori chicken but simply more delicate in colour and flavour and cooking.My main was a lamb curry (can't remember the exact description) which came as two pieces of lamb with a thick creamy red sauce around it. The sauce was soaked up by beautifully done rice. It was fantastic. The missus's main was two plaice fillets, again rubbed with a beautiful blend of spices, cooked to perfection. The salad it came with I didn't particularly care for, it was a runner bean and coconut thing. I'm just not a great fan of runner bean. It was expertly cooked and presented though. I can honestly say the plaice was sensational. So light and fluffy but with this pronounced spice which didn't mask the natural flavour of the fish. Memorable.Not that we needed a pudding afterwards but seeing as it was only \u00a32 extra to have one, then why not?Basil Panna Cotta with a ginger and date crumble is what came out. Great texture, robust basil flavour, a hint of the east with the ginger. A lovely finish.The thing about this place is that you eat an Indian here completely differently to how you eat one normally. we found ourselves savouring every mouthful, combining different flavours thoughtfully and really appreciating all that was happening on our excited tongues. Beautifully balanced is the best I can describe it. Thoughtful cooking which leads to thoughtful eating. Makes a change for a crammer like me.Service was warm, friendly and helpful, especially with me enquiring after every dish EXACTLY what went into it. Surroundings ever so swish. Not the place for a proper rave up certainly. It's quite reserved and cool, but very relaxing and you really find yourself focussing on the food.And for \u00a324 for three courses, well I think that's the best bargain I've come across in a long while. A lovely meal in every respect but mostly a real treat for the taste buds. A reminder if one was ever needed that Indian food is simply the king of all \u00a0cuisines. Je suis desole Frenchies.",

This place sets standards that few Indian restaurants could compete with, and we have eaten at Benares, Tamarind and Trishna, all of which have gained a Michelin star, I am amazed that Cinnamon Club doesn't have one.",

We were both fairly plied with wine when we left, and we had a very enjoyable evening. \u00a0It's definitely on our list of places to go back to. \u00a0I enjoyed it so much that I kind of want the cookbook.",

    "text": "A remarkable culinary journey that is unrivaled in Indian cuisine! Vivek Singh's remarkable interpretation of Indian cooking is presented with great flair at this Westminster converted library. The library bar is a quiet place to meet colleagues before retiring to the dining room for the grand meal. The downstairs bar has a little more energy for night life.The dining room includes shelves of books denoting the building's prior life. Waiting service is extremely well appointed. Make sure to ask the sommelier for recommendations from the extensive wine list. Your wine and water glasses will never reach empty at the Cinnamon Club! But enough about the atmosphere! The reason you go to CC is for the marvelous menu created by Executive Chef Vivek Singh. There was not a single dish among those I tasted from the 5 diners that I considered even mildly lacking in flavor. Dish after dish was replete with flavor and inspiration. If you have 3 hours to spare, I would recommend the 8 course tasting menu (with optional wine pairings). If not, then make sure to try one of the great appetizers, including: roasted plaice & crab, carpaccio of salmon, char-grilled Welsh lamb fillet and the tasting of Bombay street food.For the entree, Singh's roast saddle of \"Oisin\" red deer is not to be missed! The hot & sweet prawns and the Hyderabadi lamb are also quite desirable. Order a side of garlic naan and masala mashed potatoes! For dessert, the kulfi is my personal favorite but every dish I tasted was more than delicious!This will always be a \"must-visit\" for me when in London. Well done Chef Singh!!!",

As well as every beautiful thing even this one has its price. Booking is practically a must. The restaurant is set in the historic Grade II listed former Westminster Library. The food is the best Indian cuisine can provide in the world. Maybe that evening we may have overstepped with bread (as italians used) so as to spend about forty pounds just for that (about 12 Paratha). The elegant colonial atmosphere and great food make it a must, at least once in their lifetime. Dinner for three people, without wine, only sparkling water, over 300 pounds. But it was well worth it. I've been there for dinner, I hope one day to come back for other meals and to be able to taste it from breakfast to lunch, to dinner too. I strongly recommend it.",

Every one of them so delicious I could have had them as mains. I didn't have one mouthful that I didn't like throughout the whole meal. Even the naan bread was amazing.

Put simply, Cinnamon Club is for high rollers, wannabe ballers and shot callers.I remember the first time i ever came here: it was like foreplay for the tongue. I've 'done' lunch here a few times over the years, sometimes on the largesse of others at on occasion by myself and what can i say?Every time I go here the taste of the food refuses to budge from my palette for days. It's like being upgraded to First Class on a plane. You know, you go left instead of right and you start your trip off with a bang. \u00a0Every other flight experience thereafter is a pale imitation. Sprinkle in a few celebs and politicians - if you like that sort of thing - and you'll be in the zeitgeist. Let's put it this way, if you think you're sitting next to someone famous then you probably are. It's that kind of place.The sumptuous ambience takes civility up a notch. Concierge service at the front door, makes you feel like a true VIP the moment you breach the threshold. Then again, maybe they just liked my tailored suit. Sit down, ruffle an eyebrow and you'll have service before the word forms on your lips. Very attentive, very cute. But what of the food?It ain't cheap, but then again given its location, did you really expect that to be the case?If your bank manager will let you, depart from the set menu. Try to explain to him how good the food is. Though it'll be like trying to describe colour to a blind man, it's worth the effort but ultimately futile.At first glance the food doesn't look like much - shrimp on a stick, small pieces of weirdly shaped meat etc - and in truth the portions appear stingy but here, the ethos is clearly less is more. In their defence, i guess it's all about the ever-changing menu.This is a definite once a year treat for restricted budgets or if you're a bonus heavy banker-type: a light, regular snack. Still if you want to live like there's no tomorrow go ahead and throw financial caution to your stomach. The experience promises not to disappoint. Just don't expect to come away to come away any wealthier or less hungry than when you stepped in.I won't even get you started on the wine list as it'll add a minimum of 20% to your bill by my calculations...",

For a special night of amazing food i highly recommend the cinnamon club",

So I ordered okra (for my dinner main course). I had hoped to have something. Anything. Although I have food allergies, I can always find something to eat just about anywhere. I hate being the person who's difficult to serve, so I'm extremely flexible. But that did not matter at Cinnamon Club. When my okra arrived, it was clearly an appetizer portion--even though they knew it was all I could have. No effort to bulk up my plate or anything. No one made me feel welcome or as if the chef or staff hoped to do something...anything at all...to make my experience nice. What I had was okay. Sadly, my cocktail wasn't impressive either. We noticed sluggish service all around our table as well. Others had to ask for a waiter to be sent over so they could order. They were seated before we were. I was really looking forward to this meal, but I am leaving hungry and unimpressed.",

    "text": "I really, really, really wanted to like the Cinnamon Club.It's a great locale, set in the old Westminster Library, very art-deco-ish (if you like that kind of stuff), has an exclusive feel to it as you enter, but then things kind of progressively deflated as the evening wore on.Let's start with the bar, where we had to wait 15-20m despite having reservations at 830pm and having arrived on time. People have gushed about the bar, but seriously, the room is a bit incongruous, the furniture mismatched, and the overall seating arrangement a bit weird. We ordered 2 martinez's (sp??)... however, which were truly excellently mixed. Chapeau to the bar tender.We got seated, and I must say, the service for the most part was excellent. They moved us to a quiet corner, which, if you've been there, you know is difficult to achieve; the high ceilings reverberate, and the atmosphere gets pretty loud... which is great if you want to keep your conversations private.Now on with the food:For appetisers, we shared the:Grilled Scottish king scallops with hot lentil chutney, smoked Devon crab puree (17\u00a3)Hot yoghurt and chickpea soup with crisp pink aubergine steaks (\u00a38)Char-grilled Welsh lamb fillet with nutmeg, sweetbread bhaji and caper kachumber (\u00a310)Everything tasted delicious... except for the amount of money we were dishing out, I was expecting more bang for the buck, if you know what I mean. The scallops tasted amazing, but they were tiny! So great on the taste front, but really poor on the value for taste front. I know, I know, it's all about quality, not quantity... but I don't buy that BS. It's possible to have amazing quality with non military ration inspired amounts of food. This is just pure customer margin extraction.I had ordered a bottle of NZ Syrah... which was great... except 5 different waiters kept trying to pour my partner for the evening a glass of wine, despite numerous requests not to do so. I don't particularly like 'servititis', and the overzealous servers at the Club do have a little bit of that going on....The mains were even better (and the portions reasonably more adequate):Chargrilled Halibut with Kashmiri fennel and ginger sauce (\u00a325)Tandoor wild Spencer Gulf king prawns with Goan curry sauce, pandan, and coconut rice (\u00a327.50)The halibut tasted amazing, and the 4, let's say 'princely' rather than 'king' prawns were out of this world. But, I kept thinking back to my time living in Mumbai, where we would go to the ITC Hotel near the International Airport, and gorge ourselves on fat, juicy, tandoori tiger prawns for less than 10$. It made the 7\u00a3 per prawn slightly more expensive that I was happy with. Again, call me a miser... but I can't escape my internal benchmarks.For dessert, we had the 'Lime Cheesecake' and the 'Pudding, Pecan Nuts with Garam Masala ice cream'.Forget the cheesecake, it's a lump of 'cr\u00e8me fraiche' mixed through with some lime rind or something. Boring and uneventful.... the pudding however is to die for. The combination with the garam masala ice cream is out of this world, with the slight hint of heat from the masala accentuating the depth of the chocolate (kind of making it like an Indian version of mole sauce)... and the ice cream cooling stuff off. Nice combo. Worth coming back just for dessert next time (will help not to break the bank ;).All in all, 200\u00a3 for 2 people. Was it worth it ? No.Would I do it again ? Only for dessert ;)Was the food good ? YesCould I get as good quality somewhere else, minus some originality? YesNow, don't let that detract you from seeing for yourself what the fuss is about.",

    "text": "I was craving Indian food and found the Cinnamon Club and figured \"what the heck... lemme give it a try.\"I was blown away by the Cinnamon Club.The interior and overall presentation felt like a proper British club from a 1950s movie with books on shelves, leather chairs, and all manner of other subtle and posh touches.A drink in the bar was a treat. There were lots of different types of chairs, stools, benches, couches to sit on and the vibe was hushed, mellow, quiet, and romantic.The main dining room was more vibrant. While the tables were close together, we rarely heard conversations from other tables.The food was among the best I've tasted anyplace. The spices were subtle, complex, and absolutely perfectly complementary of each of the dishes. The presentation was worthy of any high end San Francisco restaurant.There were a few glitches in the service (e.g., the naan was not delivered with the first course as we requested) and every glitch resulted in the food that was not delivered as we requested being removed from the bill... without us asking.For me, the Cinnamon Club was the best of London posh club atmosphere combined with the kind of complexity and presentation that one associates with San Francisco combined with food that is the best Indian food I've ever had.All-in-all, worth the price for the excellent food and overall experience.",

Thee price of the food is a tad expensive for the a la carte menu however if you go for a set menu via Bookatable approx. \u00a330 for three courses I feel is much better as a main course on the a la carte menu is approx. \u00a323 alone. \u00a0However I went for the a la carte menu as I had a voucher to use up and that was the terms to buy from the a la carte menu so for just a starter each and a main meal plus non alcoholic cocktail for us two it came to around \u00a395. However unlike most celebrity / michellin stared chef restaurants I feel that the portions served here are much bigger than some. \u00a0I had the halibut with lemon sauce and lime rice and it was pure citrus heaven for me with a tad of back spice. \u00a0My husband had the beef with a spicy peppery coating and it was cooked to perfection (medium rare as requested). \u00a0The chocolate bomb was just lush and so tangy with the passionfruit that is in the bomb highly recommend and I love the touch of gold flake that was on top of the bomb.",

I have never been to India but it is to my understanding when you have Indian cuisine in the UK it is not much different. I have eaten at several Indian restaurants, but this was a very special invitation for our business partners, my husband and myself. The Chefs definitely put a precise modern spin on their dishes. This is not the ordinary potted masses of paneer, tikka masala and so on...this is fresh, organic free range and farm to table plating of the highest quality fish, meats, veg, and delightful desserts too. They have a selection of chutneys to pair to your plate as well. King prawns in mango sauce, Tandoori free range chicken, lamb in corn curry, Sea Bass in coconut ginger sauce served with lentils...are you drooling yet....a huge bar and drink selection too! We always have a superb crisp white wine and in this case Sauvignon Blanc to go with it. We highly suggest you treat yourselves to a lovely experience at the Cinnamon Club. We enjoyed it thoroughly and will gladly be back again.",

The prices are high for the food as others have said, but my husband and I left full. We ordered two starters, and for the main course, we shared the malai kofta.

We were barely full after the meal.2. The mango lassi doesn't taste very authentic. I can pinpoint what was off about it, but it didn't taste like a traditional mango lassi, like many other restaurants have.3. It took a very long time to get our bill at the end of the meal (about 20 minutes). Our waiter forgot about us, so I had to eventually request it.4. They should distinguish better between what water costs money and what doesn't. To clarify, request tap water if you don't want to be charged for a bottle of water or more.However, I did enjoy some aspects about it:1. It was beautiful! It used to be a library, which made for a very interesting & unique aesthetic during our meal. 2. The service, other than my negatives above, was great. They sat us quickly and we had some good conversation with our waiter.I probably wouldn't recommend this place unless it's a very special occasion.",

The tandoori oven was too hot causing it to not rise correctly while cooking... In India I saw a monkey that was in charge of a tandoori bread oven, so can you imagine how easy it should be.3. \u00a0I had an asparagus starter that was sent to the table after it lost its temperature. \u00a0The flavor profile was nice, despite it's delayed delivery.4. \u00a0I chose the butter chicken for a main course since there were only three or four meat options, while most Indian restaurants of at least fifteen different options. \u00a0It was an over cooked breast without enough sauce to accompany it.5. \u00a0Dessert, not a chance after that train wreck.In summary, this is a businessperson's(tourist) environment in a nice building with fancy table cloths. \u00a0Selling alcohol is CLEARLY the priority. \u00a0Service was horrible relative to the price. \u00a0My server had no support staff and that is insane for the amount they are charging.I later learned of a place call Brick Lane(?) where locals go to get REAL Indian food.",

We were seated in the upper area, which had an incredibly strange layout because they had clearly moved tables around to accommodate other parties - so to the left of us was a giant gaping hole in the middle of the dining area which just looked rather strange.We opted for some kind of prix-fixe corse that related to the Royal wedding, it said it was a traditional Bengali wedding course. It came out on a platter and each dish was about the size of 1 cup (sorry, American units) and for me, was really hit and miss between all of them. Whatever dish the giant prawn was in though, was one of the best Indian dishes I've had of all time. The bread was dense, but a bit overly greasy. The service was slightly inattentive. The locale was hard to find (it's not labeled from the outside) and if someone hadn't seen us looking so confused and asked us if were looking for the Cinnamon Club, we probably would have walked past it a few times. The interior was beautiful, but we were seated in the upper area so we could barely see/appreciate any of it. It was a neat place to come but I was a bit disappointed that we were seated upstairs because that defeated most of the reasons why we had decided to come here in the first place. I probably won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "My friends were visiting from the U.S. last week and they suggested \"high end Indian\" for dinner on Friday night. I haven't had a lot of experience with this niche category, as to me Indian usually means the neighbourhood curry joint or one of the go-tos around Whitechapel or Brick Lane. But I've definitely heard of quite a few big names, and after thorough research, I would conclude that there are at least 8 high end / Michelin Indian establishments in London, which could really only happen in a city like London. Given this was Thursday night and I was trying to make a booking for Friday night, they were all fully booked and the best I could do was an 8:45 PM booking at the Cinnamon Club. So that's how we ended up at the Cinnamon Club.That said, it is a fantastically impressive place to take visitors to London. It's located not far from Westminster, so on our cab ride over there was an impromptu viewing of the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. The building is the former Westminster Library, and the walls are filled with an impressive collection of old books. There is even a plaque outside to commemorate the history. We were in a chatty mood and too busy catching up to contemplate the menu, so we went for the full tasting menu. It was priced at \u00a385, and we got a bottle of Sangiovese to share. In hindsight, I wouldn't particularly recommend that wine, but there were some other reasonably priced options on the wine list, as well as the high end that you would expect.I would describe the food as fine dining with an Indian flair, mostly with a strong dose of spices. But it is completely recognizable from your typical curry and rice / naan (in fact we never saw rice or naan during the whole meal!) There was a heavily spiced soup that was perhaps the strongest indication that the meal was Indian influenced. But otherwise, there was a salmon carpaccio, some seasonal squab, and poached pear with ice cream, among others. When we ordered, I had asked how long the tasting menu would take, and they indicated 2-3 hours, which was about right (I think we were about 2.5 hours). So it's not a huge endeavour to undertake (having done some 5 hour tasting menus), and just the right amount of food (we didn't feel like we overate).Overall I would definitely recommend the experience (especially for visitors), but given it's fine dining rather than your local curry house, I'm not in a rush to go back again.",

    "text": "For my first trip to the UK, I was really looking forward to trying some LEGIT Indian food. A co-worker recommended Vivek Singh's Cinnamon Club, so we made a reservation. It sounded conceptually awesome! As we jumped out of our Uber, it was hard to tell we were at the right place, as the entrance is a bit unwelcoming.The atmosphere was very contemporary. From the bright lighting and modern furniture to the service, we were set up for a fine dining experience. But that's not actually what we experienced...We started with a selection of chutneys. 3 arrived... one was delightfully spicy and the other two were siiiiiickly sweet. I've had my fair share of stateside naan and hoped my UK experience would be even more flavorful. Not at all... all of the bread was fine at best. The varieties were lost on me.My tablemate and I decided to share the \"Old Delhi style\" butter chicken on the bone which came with, black lentils, pilau rice and more garlic naan. We added the chilled bitter melon, pickled shallot and cucumber salad, and the home-style split yellow peas with cumin.First up, the sides were mediocre. The only thing that stood out was the bitter melon salad, which had an incredible flavor and texture. Everything else was surprisingly bland! Like, scratch your head bland, why is there no salt on the table bland.And for the chicken? The sauce and flavors were INCREDIBLE. Deep, dark, full of mouth feel and just... wow wow wow. But... for some bizarre reason, as it was prepared table side, I was served only wing parts, while my companion got thigh and white meat... cutting through and trimming meat off the bone when I just wanted to eat was beyond disappointing. We only realized the strange serving error as we shared notes after the dinner in our cab.Will I be back? More than likely not. For the price and flavors, it's just not worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly lovely restaurant. But for the price, it should be perfect, which it is nowhere near.",

The reason I gave 4 stars was due to the service. We felt others around us were getting good service but we seemed to get less attention. It was terrible but for where my expectations were at it could have been better. \u00a0I had the sea bass and my husband had the red deer. The sea bass was super delicious w red lentils and a delicious curry sauce. Also the bar area on the bottom floor was super cool and stylish! Definitely pick this as a cocktail stop!!",

I couldn't stop eating this, and neither could my husband (I didn't want to share).- Grilled halibut was well received by my husband. I can't comment on the taste but the portion size was quite small.- Baked plaice sole was good. Accompanying sauce was tasty as well.- Organic roti and naan were very good. Love that they offer organic options.- Mango sorbet was complimentary (for my birthday) and was delicious.Prices were decent for a restaurant of this caliber.The bottom line: we'd definitely return!",

The restaurant is so discreet one might have difficulties finding it (they've kept the old Westminster Library entrance) - upon entering you will see room to the left, which is the bar (please see photos), and the main restaurant ahead. The reception is well decorated with beautiful paintings, but the main restaurant has less - only because it's kept the original bookshelves from the old library. We were sat on the open ground floor, but there is an upper level (as one would find in a library setup) which may offer a more intimate setting if necessary. Words don't do the inner decor justice, so please refer to the photos.On to the food - we were well greeted by the waiting staff and lead to our table. After sitting down we were offered complimentary rice cakes - even before the menus had arrived! The menu offers a variety of dishes. Some of us went with the set menu, others a la carte - the portions are just right and the seasoning perfect. The alphonso mango was a theme throughout the brunch, with me ordering alphonso mango lassi to drink. The food came beautifully presented, and tasting equally good. Between our starter and main, as well as the main and dessert, we were offered complimentary sweets and alphonso mango - this didn't feel forced or tacky - genuinely good fillers between meals. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly throughout the whole experience, even when we were leaving.The price came to approx. \u00a345 per person for two/three courses and a drink. We were well satisfied with the whole experience and are certain to return. 5/5 no qualms about it.",

The waitstaff was only okay. They were very busy due to the Christmas holiday, but I found them to be unattentive. The atmosphere in The Cinnamon Club is light and elegant.Their bar is a real find- its a library with a bar tucked in the corner. They have an extensive drink menu. It was a great Christmas lunch.",

    "text": "The Cinnamon Club offers Indian style breakfasts that are an interesting take on the traditional British fry up. So if you fancy something with a bit of spice to get you going in a morning it's worth a visit. I'm not sure that their food agreed with me though as the spicy scrambled eggs, Bombay spiced vegetables with cumin and a jasmine tea that I washed it all down with was a bit too much of a taste explosion to experience first thing. I would definitely go back to eat later on in the day as the food and service were top notch, but Indian for breakfast just seems a bit wrong (yes I admit to eating least nights curry when I woke up, but that's just somehow different, isn't it?!).I'll be sticking to bacon sarnies and fry ups, but if you for those of you who like it hot at all times of the day then it's nice to know that there are variations of the great British breakfast also available on London's morning menu.",

It's not far from the Houses of Parliament, which is why I thought it was a great place to bring someone who's over in London on their travels. That's what I did, and my friend was chuffed to see Big Ben at night after our sumptuous shared banquet.My recommendation would be the mystifyingly spicy plaintain dumplings with beetroot chutney. The bread basket is also pretty sensational. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the desserts aren't in the same level as the frankly knockout modern indian cuisine.Dinner: around \u00a332 per head for 3 courses (with special offers)Would suit: small groups, couples, foodies with an eye for ambience",

The menu is fine for omnivores, but is definitely sparse when it comes to vegetarians. The waiter suggested a main dish for one of our party which was off-menu, and it was insubstantial and very disappointing. In the end both vegetarians in our group had the set menu which comprised a 'Bengali vegetable chop' (very good) and 'Assamese vegetable dumplings' (delicious). The fried courgette flower was also pronounced to be impressive. The meat eaters enjoyed the grilled scallops and crab paste starter which was excellent, and the Tandoori Gulf king prawns were highly praised. I had the Calfreal black leg chicken which was really very good. What I liked most about the food here was not only its consistency across the board (except the off menu dish), but also the subtlety of the flavours. Very few elements were very spicy (and as an Indian I tend to put chilli on everything), and this feast taught me just how clever and creative a chef could be with spices. Loved it. One of the best Indian meals ever and I shall return.",

I left midway through the meal to meet with the manager to speak about paying for the dinner as a good host. I was told that there was a man in my company and he was the host and he would make the decision! I try to explain that I was the host, and that I would be paying for it and do not want my my guess to see me pay for it. He abruptly turned away and walked away. I have never ever ever been so disrespected in my life. I truly feel that this was a slight and as later proves he walks the bill personally over to the only man in our group and placed it in his hands. I was so embarrassed as the man we were with then felt he must pay for everyone. It was truly an embarrassment and I am ashamed. I will never go here again.",

    "text": "If there are generally acknowledged to be two kinds of cinnamon -- the legitimate kind, cinnamomum verum, and its poor relative, 'bastard' cassia from Saigon -- then this must surely be a third: cinnamomum colonium, the rich affable uncle dispensing fat cigars and expensively-wrappered bonbons from Bombay. The Cinnamon Club -- whose proximity to the House of Commons makes it a favourite haunt of power-victualling MPs (we spotted a few ourselves, mostly of the affable uncle variety; those aspiring politicians of a lean and hungry look being, we surmised, still in the office) -- is wood-panelled, high-ceilinged, leather-seated and altogether distinctly colonial in ambience. Indeed, the Club's chic new City-branch sister restaurant, Cinnamon Kitchen, has taken up residence - appropriately or inappropriately, depending which way you look at it - in the old spice warehouses of the East India Company. As political correctness goes, the Old Westminster Library -- since 2001 the setting for restaurateur Iqbal Wahhab's original vision of Indian fine dining -- seems positively tame by comparison.If the Cinnamon Club courts the colonial aesthetic, its chef takes up the cudgels against an equally familiar Anglo-Indian institution: the curry-house. Ringing the changes on the apocryphal origins of chicken tikka masala -- one man and a can of tomato soup. Don't ask. -- Indian cuisine is alchemized (or, as detractors will have it, \"Frenchified\") in Vivek Singh's kitchen by the use of haute cuisine cooking techniques. Leaving aside the slightly dubious semantics of Singh's claim for a menu \"beyond authenticity,\" the point is: it works. As I hope to show. Once seated, watered, and titillated by the chef's amuse-gueule, a Lilliputian basket of gorgeously spicy tamarind in a polenta shell (solid enough, gratifyingly, to eat rather than to inhale), we ordered the roast saddle of 'Oisin' red deer, mouth-wateringly tender and seared to ruby in the French manner for an eye-watering \u00a332. (Yes, it was worth it.). Having skipped a starter, we over-compensated on side-dishes. The masala mashed potatoes (\u00a33) were coarsely mashed, Indian-style, and would have tasted far nicer had I known that while eating them (note to palate: for \"lumpy\", read \"authentic\"). Meanwhile, the mushroom and spinach stir-fry (\u00a35) was heaven in a few fleshy mouthfuls, belying its rather pedestrian description with funghi so lusty in flavour as to make even the laying on of spinach-strands feel one indulgence too far. As for the selection of breads (\u00a36): suffice it to say that if roti, paratha and naan sound like characters from an Indian fairy-tale, show me the multi-grained, organic fairy-tale hot from the griddle and stuffed with delicately saffroned potato chunks -- and I just might credit the analogy. Our waiters -- flawless throughout -- having tactfully decamped while we digested the hefty bill (I blame \u00a0the red deer), we had ample time to up-end our wine bottle (a two-year old Chilean pinot noir, excellent value at \u00a334) and, finding it obdurately empty, to talk ourselves into a cocktail in one of the Club's two award-winning lounge bars. My vote was for the Library Bar, the literature scholar in me having found something naggingly ignoble in the supplanting of Westminster's shrine of learning by Westminster's best restaurant. (I sense objections. Yes, I /did/ just compare a fairy-tale with a hot chapatti, and find the fairy-tale wanting. But I didn't mean it.) Disappointingly few tomes remain in the main restaurant space, most relegated to the upper gallery or to the bar in the former Reading Room -- pure 'Club', not a whiff of cinnamon -- which, on peering in after dinner, was as empty as our bottle of pinot noir. It would, of course, be unfair to attribute the apparent unpopularity of the Library Bar to the quality of its reading material on the grounds of just one observed title (which, for reasons of copyright, and a bad memory, I paraphrase as \"A Compendious History of Coal-Mining\".)The Club's ultra-modern second bar (downstairs) had fared better, racking up an impressively non-zero clientele of mainly (we thought) pre-dinner drinkers. The not-especially-welcome presence of a large, sports-broadcasting projection screen (the bar moonlights as a bijou Bollywood movie theatre; unfortunately, this wasn't one of those nights) was more than compensated for by the exuberant Asian-inspired cocktail menu. 'Fool's Gold', among the Club's signature cocktails, and chosen for the sheer hedonism of its ingredients (I'm a sucker for edible gold leaf) offers, in fact, much more than novelty value and cute gold twinkles. A faintly glowing ochre in hue, it's complex and saffron-smooth, with a trace of cardamom that delivers -- thankfully -- less a kick than a discreet tap on the shoulder from a Westminster aide. And not an \"Illustrated Chronicle of the Coal Trade\" in sight.",

See the Cinnamon Club as an experiment in fine dining in the style of the Indian Sub-continent. Ambiance is first class, which isn't always easy to achieve with large spaces like this old library the restaurant now occupies. Ask to sit on the bench seating along the back for a kingly view of the whole dining area - great for people watching. Yes it is expensive - both times I've been there the bill has come to \u00a384 for three courses including wine & coffee. They do a special set menu for \u00a322, but you have to order before 7:30 or after 9:30 - an absolute bargain in my honest opinion! Can't fault the food or service. Some of the waiters try a little too hard, and would benefit from being more relaxed, but I've never had to wait long for anything. If you come here on your own, you're offered a newspaper to read while you wait! The staff, while initially seeming a little dry are very friendly once you get to know them. I've been twice last week and I'll definitely go back - this will probably become my favourite haunt while I'm working in Westminster. Cool little bar downstairs which would be great for a Qype party. AHunter are you reading this?",

    "text": "When we stayed in London for a week last time, my fianc\u00e9e and me lived on indian food basically for the whole time. Almost made it, and with highly diverse results. We went to Cinnamon Club upon recommendation by a friend. Otherwise, I guess, we would not have found it. When I checked the web page online, I feared we would not get a reservation for dinner on the same day, but that was not an issue. Passing by Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, we found the Cinnamon Club in a side road. What a nice place! We sat in the middle of the lower floor, and it was quite big and lively there. Three business gentlemen at the next table each had 2 cellphones sitting next to their cutlery and were heavily discussing. Not the perfect place for a dinner for two, I thought. But I deemed wrong. The service was top! We had about four different waiters during the stay, and we never felt we had to wait for anything. Quite a difference when you're used to my home town's restaurants. The food is, as others noted here, a mixture of anglo/french/european style and indian cuisine. Don't expect the usual stuff for the usual price. You won't get it at Cinnamon Club. Admittedly, for enjoying a snug evening with garlic naan and massalla gosht, I still prefer my favourite indian place I go to since many years. But to make a difference, Cinneman Club is the place to go for lovers of indian cuisine. We chose a la carte, and spent something like 280 pounds that evening for starters, excellent meals, and an enchanting dessert, each accompanied by fit and proper choices of wine. I can't remember leaving that much money in a restaurant for a single dinner before, and I didn't believe I'd be willing to do so, either. After visiting Cinnamon Club, I changed my mind, and we will go there again, the next time we visit London. One down-side was the bar down stairs was closed for a private reception that evening we were there, so we could not test that. Well. There should always be something to look forward to, the next time.",

    "text": "went to the Cinnamon Club on Saturday, and what a perfect spot to enjoy a special occassion. i'm just starting to appreciate Indian cuisine and this restaurant is the place to go to if you are in those same shoes. the food is flavorful, not drenched or overwhelmed by sauce and spice and heat. i had the seared chicken and while it was good, i think i liked my husband's pork loin better. i loved the sides we chose, my favorite being the spinach and mushroom stir-fry. i ended the meal with the pumpkin tart served with homemade clove ice cream - yum! the wait staff was so attentive, specifically making sure that i knew all of the ingredients and cooking temperatures to the items i chose - guess the black dress i wore no longer hides the pregnant belly i've got! they also brought me pillows for extra back support, so thoughtful.only bummer was that there was a private party going on in the swanky lounge downstairs, so we couldn't retire there for a drink and further ambience after our meal.",

    "text": "I'm not a great Indian food eater but got taken here by my partner who is and I have to say it was very pleasant. We were seated in the old library while we waited for a table and sipped on Kia Royales. We were then taken to our table in the main room which was lovely. It had a real buzzy atmosphere and the food served was delicious. The table next to us was having the taster menu which I believe is quite expensive \u00a3100+ but definitely worth a try on a revisit. The wine list complemented the type of food very well and I can see why this place is so popular. Its a modern twist on the typical Indian type restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.",
