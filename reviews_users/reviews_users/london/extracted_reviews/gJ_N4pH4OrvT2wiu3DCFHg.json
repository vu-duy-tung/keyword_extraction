    "text": "This is a typical british pub, with its typical booze, food and decoration. It's placed next to the Thames, in the south shore. It was supposed to be a place frequented by famous writers, and it's easy to figure out why, with different rooms on the ground floor, a restaurant upstairs, and also two terraces: one on the first floor with fabulous views and other outside the building, being the closest you can get to the river. Unfortunately, there's no beer garden, but you won't miss it that much with all the riverside available for you. The prices are not expensive, but sometimes it can get quite overcrowded, meaning that ordering can be quite a nightmare, specially if you are hungry. Anyway, food is quite tasteful, despite they don't have anymore Sunday roast, one of their best. Instead, they have a wider selection of fish & chips, and you still can order your roast on the restaurant area.",

If you have a hood on your coat, a pair of pink striped mittens, a full bottle of wine and a packet of cigarettes, there is nothing the British weather can throw at you for which you are not prepared. And, by this rationale, so began an evening of drinking in the Anchor Bankside. Or, rather, outside it. I have to admit, I don't think I've ever actually drunk inside this pub. The outside patio area on the Thames is so alluring that we always, but always, sit outside: in the summer, when it's bursting with drinkers and you'll be hard pressed to find a table, and on nights like tonight, when we were the only crazy people choosing to be buffeted by the wind and rain under the billowing and creaking awnings The Anchor is the perfect spot for a bit of people-watching and putting the world to rights.",

The venue is large and airy inside and holds onto some historic charm from decades ago (well I imagine it does as I'm too young to know).

A nice location along Bankside and a hop skip to Borough Market but there's many better drinking establishments in the area. Beers are boring and bland and once again better pubs close-by.

The Anchor is in a tourist location, but it is also the oldest pub in London. The location is right on the Thames so eating on the deck could be fun, but we went in the bar.The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave me sample tastes of the ales so I could make my selections (thanks Anchor!) and helped me figure out that you order and pay at the bar. The food selection in the bar was fairly extensive (but the sticky toffee pudding is only available in the (more expensive) restaurant section). We found the entire place to be clean, including the loos (restrooms).I enjoyed two different ales and we both had the Sunday (beef) roast. While the roast was decent, it was obvious that it was mass produced and did not have an in-house cooked flavor.We would stop there again if we were in the area. For the excellent staff, cleanliness, ale selection and value, 4 stars.",

The food isn't brought to your table either, you're given a pager and have to go fetch it. It is no surprise then that patrons decide to fetch food from the neighbouring take away places instead.

I have walked past on a number of occasions and have always wanted to go in ... attracted by its open riverside seating area and the roof terrace. I went there twice recently during the world cup. On the first trip we had booked a table upstairs but during the second i had just walked in.First shock. Just 4 tv screens in the whole pub which probably had more than 10 different seating areas. Two downstairs and two upstairs and only one in the open air. There were multiple rooms without tv's ... which is not cool if you are advertising that all 64 matches would be shown there.Second. The service. I understand that pubs in England are notoriously slow but this one was an order of magnitude slower than the rest. People had started queuing up at the bar from long before the match was about to start. I reached the counter after kick-off. The fact that the game had started did not affect the bartender's service standard at all. He poured the whisky and then stopped to do some work with the wine list with his colleague while i waited. After i paid by card, my receipt had been printed but he was too busy chatting to notice ... and all this while the match was going on. I got extremely irritated.Third. During half time one of us went to the bar to order some food. They said that food wasn't available, neglecting to mention that we could order in a different room. We were quite surprised to see later that people were eating. Well ... it was Anchor which lost some business.Fourth. When i went for the second time, to watch the 3rd-4th place play-off between Germany and Uruguay, i found that it was being shown on only one of the 4 screens ... the others were, believe me or not, switched off.The only reasons i am giving them 2 stars and not one are that they serve Black Label and their fish and chips is not significantly below average.",

It's very much a \"tourist trap\" although some of the patrons appeared to be City workers unwinding after a day in the office. The gentleman who took my order from me was very pleasant although I would say that prices were above what I would call standard pub fare. However, I detract. The chips and side of bread & butter were delicious and warming!I have deducted one star for the state of the toilets. They weren't dirty but definitely lacked any attention in the decoration stakes. I would say that the dull paintwork and lighting gave it the aura of dirtiness. Would I recommend here? Based on my first visit, I would. There's a decent seating area outside which would be ideal for the Summer months.The staff were friendly and polite and after the hustle and bustle of being pushed around by the man on the street it made a pleasant change!",

The rumor is that Shakespeare used to drink here, so it would be nice if they had an old school traditional menu. But, it is a fun little bar, with an outdoor deck and patio. We had an appetized and the Pimm's pitcher and we enjoyed our time. If they could fix the menu, I would definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Pretty good pub considering what a tourist trap it could be sitting right there on the Southbank. An absolute labyrinth of a place, it's got room after room and floor after floor of space, bar and terrace (and even a slightly separated, covered and raised up terrace overlooking the water).I've ended up here simply to escape the rain (twice), as well as for pre-meditated Friday night work drinks and in the middle of the week day because I was just around and needed a break. The first time we stumbled in on an England v Australia rugby match, so the place was packed, loud and slightly terrifying. Though somehow we managed to get a table for four -- which is either a testament to how large this place is or (more likely) we sat directly under the TV which meant it was a table without a view that no one wanted :)More recently I came for work drinks, during which one of the upper floor rooms was reserved for our group. We had a small dedicated bar and bartender, while the space was tucked away and had access to an almost private upper-floor terrace. It worked well for our group of 40-50.I think most people will be tempted to hunker down and get lunch or dinner here, but I don't recommend it. It's a lovely place to rest your feet with a pint, warm up by the fire and dry off if you've been doing the tourist thing all day, but there is better food to be had very close (try Nando's for chicken, GBK for burgers, PizzaExpress for pizza/salads or, if it's a Thurs-Sat during the day, walk around the corner to Borough Market for a plethora of unique food stalls).",

The burgers aren't bad, but they certainly won't impress your taste buds like a masterful creation from Byron. A weird caveat - when I ordered at the bar they told me it'd take 45 minutes for two burgers. This is around 6pm on a weekday. I said fine, but 15 minutes later our burgers arrived. So I'm not sure what that was about, but just FYI for anyone else who encounters the same!",

Service was quick and friendly, the prices were definitely a bit steep compared to some of the other pubs we visited, but we felt the end justified the means. This place is a bit of a landmark, and you definitely pay for it, but the interior and exterior are adorable, and the location is bar-none right on the Thames. Notes for outsiders (like us!): There is traditionally no wait service at pubs in London (probably everywhere in the UK? I can only speak to London). You order and pay at the bar and the food is brought to your table. The ordering and paying also takes place at the same time. Additionally, tipping is a whole different ball game here. What most of the locals and others explained is that tip is not expected but is appreciated and you typically just round off your bill with the tip. For example, if you bill is 27.50 pounds, you can be nice and just give them 30 and call it even. Maybe we're wrong, but that's what everyone seemed to be doing.Now, a vast number of the pubs in London are \"Fuller's\" pubs. I never really understood this entirely, but it basically means that the menu and beers are extremely similar everywhere you go with slight deviations (a different pie here, a different beer there) but we were a little confused when so many of the pubs (despite having different names) were nigh carbon copies of each other as far as the menu went. We didn't complain, because it was all great and we were having great experiences, but that was definitely noteworthy.",

    "text": "Beautiful looking from the outside, lot of character from the outside and brilliant location - as many before me have written.Lots of space inside, but maze like in the ground floor and a nice out door patio to sit. Went after dark so the view was so so.From the fare perspective - while the bar tenders were friendly they didn't have basic single malts we asked for, asked for a double gin and tonic but I believe I got vodka lemonade instead. I am was told by my friends that the house wine was nice.Food was below average - we ordered some veggie nachos but it was too salty. We asked for some ketchup for the chips which never came. No one cleared the tables on cue and there were broken chairs lying around which had the potential to cause serious bodily harm - with protruding nails.As many would agree - looks good from the outside, nice location that's pretty much it. Tourists might enjoy but \u00a0I will probably \u00a0not visit again.",

Friendly people so sharing can be fun and you never know those other sharers may like a chat, especially if they are visitors and want a little help with the ways of London. Plenty of space and a good choice of beers. Quick service even though very busy.",

Very very slow service, nobody pays attention to the customers, food came out very cold after we asked several times when it was coming. Tasted terrible, nothing good about this experience except the fact that it is Bankside, on the Thames. \u00a0And close to the globe theater. Probably don't care to treat their customers well, when they'll get more anyway, based on location.",

In a very busy tourist deluged area, the dilemma was trying to find a lunch spot that would would satisfy our hunger and not be just awful. After a brief \u00a0look see, we decided to give this place a try.Of course we had to try the fish & chips as this was an obvious specialty. My order was served hot in a large portion to satisfy just about anyone.In a high volume tourist dominated spot, The Anchor was better than what we expected.",

I had the mushroom and beef pie, and it came with a side of vegetables that were actually al dente! It was delicious- one of the better pub meals we had. It's certainly in a convenient location.",

We ordered the fish and chips and while the fish itself was nice, we ended-up picking off the batter because it was a bit soggy. \u00a0They had poor timing on our order - one came out quickly, the other came out when we were nearly finished.

    "text": "Poorly skilled bartenders. I went here for food with some friends who were visiting from Canada. The bar wasn't busy, but the two female bar staff couldn't cope. They were taking absolutely no notice of which customers arrived at the bar first and they allowed at least two people to jump the queue. When my friends went to the bar, they said the exact same thing happened to them. Part of being a decent bartender is noticing who has been waiting the longest. It seems like these bartenders aren't skilled or trained for their jobs. I dread to think what it's like when the bar is actually busy. I'd never go back here. I prefer to be served by professional bar staff. I was embarrassed to have taken my friends to this place.",
