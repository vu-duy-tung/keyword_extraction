    "text": "Stumbled across this gem of a pub when they had one of their regular 3 courses for \u00a318 on top table. So glad I did as we now go for dinner every Sunday. Even without the promo the food as well as being out of this world like you would expect in any ramsay restaurant is fabulous value for money, Have taken my parents, my best friends and our grown up children and must have covered every item on the menu between us and can not find a bad word to say about any of it.The pigeon with crispy bacon and quail egg is my fav starter totally delicious. All the fish dishes are amazing but the hake and chips will have you never wanting fish and chips from anywhere else again it is simply to die for, the chips are always just amazing sounds nuts over chips but they are divine crispy on the outside and so soft and hot on the inside you have to try them to know what I am talking about!Other favourite is the hanger steak. And deserts the eton cherry mess and banana split are scrumptious. Service always fantastic as you would expect, Andrei is totally amazing has been our server every week and has a fabulous knowledge of champagnes, which incidentally are very good prices for London, if you want something more special special they have some vintages and houses not on the menu like 99 cristal.The decor of course excellent the atmosphere fantastic and as for the view over the Thames brilliant. As you would expect for such a great value place they often get fully booked at weekends so booking is essential but if online says they are full is always worth giving a call. As have managed to squeeze me in on these occasions. To sum up fabulous.Would also say is pretty obvious that several of the reviews on here are total nonsense besides the lady below who actually states she did not eat there there seem to be several 1 star comments from people who have never written a review before, I get the feeling that other empty pubs and restaurants near by with plenty of time on their hands due to competition from the narrow which they can't possibly match have signed up just to try and smear what is an outstanding place, am sure people on here have enough intelligence to see through this, and if u doubt have a look at reviews on top table where you have actually had to eat there(by booking through them) to leave a review as you would expect not one complaint on there!!Love at first bite",

The Narrow, his East London enterprise, didn't disappoint. Just south of Lime House DLR and hard along the Thames, this is a handsome, stylish, smartly managed pub with surprisingly good food and absolutely no attitude. I came in after the lunch rush and was warmly welcomed [as a party of one] and seated in the dining room with a lovely view of the Thames. I ordered clam chowder, banger and mash and a local brew from Greenwich. None of it disappointed. The service was spot-on; the staff outgoing. You can whatever you want about GR's manner and tone but you can't argue with the food or service. Top notch.",

Lovely for our kids who went and sat on deckchairs on the walkway whilst we waited for drinks (must say a very child-friendly crowd for such a chic looking eaterie). Like most people on here I thought the staff were lovely and althogh it may not be any deliberate policy the fact that they were all shapes, sizes and nationalities instead of models from Casting Central was brilliant. I have probably just been libellious. The food itself was ok. my pork was fantastic but the veggies were overdone a bit but it was just a great trip on a lovely summer's evening.",

Not a single person at our had any problems with their starters or mains except that we wanted more. The fish dishes deserve special acclaim as they truly were cooked to perfection: great colour, tender, with all the natural tastes of fish oozing out. One particular surprise was the deliciousness of the roasted potatoes; fluffy insides were covered by a nicely browned skin, slightly crispy and not overly oily. Everyone who tried them were delighted by this simple treat. Speaking of treats, dessert is not to be missed! Chocolate cake, gypsy tarts and ice cream. I selected a brilliantly subtle elderflower jelly with summer fruits. We were practically licking our plates at the end. A great experience all around and I'll definitely be going back.",

This however, doesn't matter as the pub is everything you'd expect frmo a typical English pub. But perhaps that is also where the problem lies, there is nothing outstanding about it. The food is good and reasonably priced, and there are plenty of beers on tap and bottled. However, the whole attachment of 'Ramsey' to the place just makes clients expect a little more? As a pub it's excellent, with Ramseys name attached I expected a little more.",

Service: The service was about a 7/10Food: I am a vegetarian, and there is 1 vegetarian main on the menu, which nowadays is quite rare. \u00a0The 1 main was lentils. \u00a0I am sorry but lentils is the most boring food ever, now being that Gordon is so well known you would have thought that there would have been a bit more imagination put into that main, since when did any pub sell lentils??I asked if they cooked something else, and the waiter said \"no\" so in the end, I ordered food from the bar. \u00a0The main I had was mushrooms on toast with a poached egg, with a side of green beans and chips. \u00a0The food was really tasty and the chips were really nice. \u00a0For dessert we were told that the sticky toffee pudding (Which we all wanted funny enough) was not available :( so I opted for raspberry tart and hazelnut ice cream, it was lovely, the ice cream was really tasty. \u00a0My friend had the chocolate mousse, which was also very nice. Price: The prices seem a bit high, but that could be down to location. \u00a0Evaluation: I wouldn't go again, only due to the lack of veggie options, if they ramped up the menu a bit more, then I would def go again, but only on a sunny day :)",

We headed there mid week mid summer for lunch on a sparklingly sunny day. Oddly, even though it was about 1pm there was almost no punters. Bought a couple of pints, grabbed a copy of both the restaurant and bar menus and headed out to soak up the sun. A selection from the starters to share sounded most interesting so asked for them at the bar only to be told that they could only be served inside in the restaurant, which had possibly 8 diners in total. Only food from the bar menu was available outside. Okay, we'll spend less but am happy to try scotch eggs, smoked potato cakes and steamed mussels and a pea & broad bean salad. No. Turns out all they have available to serve from the bar menu is cheeseburger or a BLT. Absolutely nothing else. So we left. Rentamob staff who couldn't give a toss rounded out a perfectly awful experience. It's the kind of place that would go down a storm on Kitchen Nightmares...",

Very interested to see what kind of establishment the uber-critic would run!I went by on a Wednesday evening round 8:00, and the place was active, but certainly not crowded. The bar was more-or-less empty and there were groups of diners in the large dining area. I was seated without any problem, but -- the bane of the solo diner! -- I was hidden away in an obscure corner of the restaurant. The menu choices consisted of a variety of Pub staples, and I chose a couple of traditional choices (again curious to see how standard Pub grub would be served in Ramsay's place.) I started with a very good Belgian lager and potato-leek soup. Both were very good -- the soup, in particular, was excellent. I followed up with the Bangers and Mash, and a side of green beans. The sausages and potatoes were tasty and satisfying, if a little boring as a main dish (but then again, I suppose if you ask for Bangers and Mash, that's what it is...) The green beans were very fresh and nicely crunchy. Service was very friendly and attentive, and in general, I had a very satisfying meal.Also, probably a little bit more expensive than an average pub meal, but really very reasonably priced. Definitely a place to go back to on a future trip for a tasteful twist on your typical pub meal...!",

If you can get a spot here I'd recommend it. Although the style of pub is modern, there has been a pub on this spot for a while now (and way way back there was a brewery here). They serve a few ales.

When we finally got our table it wobbled so we asked the waiter for something to wedge under it and never received anything so used a menu instead. When ordering we were told that certain things were off the menu, but the next table that arrived after us managed to order these things. Our waiter was more interested in chatting to the other staff than trying to take our order and when our food eventually arrived we had no cutlery so we had to ask someone else for that. We didn't stay for more than a main course as we could see that it was a shambles and didn't want to waste anymore time and money.

We were not disappointed, the dining room was cosy and warm with views out across the river. The menu was ecelectic, all very British but a mix of the standard gastro pub type options like bangers and mash (fancy ones mind) and then more alternative choices like pigs cheeks. We ordered a range of options and all had a try of each others dishes, they were all lovely and it created great discussion about food. Three courses later and many bottles of wine we all stumbled out onto the street only \u00a330 lighter. And the journey home was brief, its not as far away as you might imagine. The only criticism is that when we moved from the restaurant to the bar to relax with another bottle of wine, they didn't note that we had moved and wouldn't put the wine onto the main bill. This didn't make much sense to us and they weren't very helpful about it. When we did then ask for the bill it took half an hour to get it as again, they were unaware that we had moved tables. Not so slick but next time I know to treat the restaurant and bar as two separate venues and pay the individual bills for each. I would still go back for the food most definitely.",

Having moved from West London to the Canary Wharf area, it is nice to finally have decent gastropub offering in the area - it is something lacking in the E14 neighbourhood. The menu is quite short, but always offers imaginative dishes made from traditional British ingredients. Excellent quality ingredients, prepared simply and well - I have yet to be disappointed by the standards of the cooking. Another nice surprise is the wine list. You might imagine that they would try to make money on the wine, but the wines on offer are very good quality and reasonably priced. The one I picked last time was a very good Italian at \u00a326 - it was either the most expensive of 2nd most expensive on the list. Eating in the riverside conservatory is very nice. The main dining room is comfortable and pleasant too - seating is well spaced - not too crowded. Where they need to perhaps improve is on is the consistency of the service. Some visits I've had less than attentive service from grumpy waitresses. One time, in an almost empty dining room I waved at the waitress to get the bill, and she kind of brushed me off and carried on rearranging chairs for the evening session. In my book, sorting out the customer would be a higher priority than prepping for evening service - I was not happy. But on other visits the waiting staff have been fine. They could also do with changing the menu more often.",

The onion rings made up for it's shortcomings.Other items ordered were nice, but they should've been for the price. \u00a0Service was arrogant, until the bill arrived whereby it miraculously improved! \u00a0I think we're moving on.",

A few general tips1) make reservations2) have everyone show up on time3) go on a (rare) sunny day and enjoy the patioWhile some could claim there is too much \"Gordon Ramsay halo effect\" but I didn't think so. The food was very good (though our group was too large to order off the full menu) and the prix fixe menu we had was well matched and diverse enough for the group's dietary restrictions.The few down sides - the space is not very conducive to waiting at the bar for a table unless it is nice enough for the patio to be used. The service was a little bit gruff, admittedly some parts of the large group were a bit, well demanding - so I'm not holding it against them at this point.",

These looked pretty good from across the table, although neither dish would be a reason to visit in itself. \u00a0I opted for skate, served traditionally with a butter and caper sauce. \u00a0This was tasty and showed that kitchen was capable of food which was more stretching than deep frying some fish or grilling a burger. \u00a0However, the majority of the menu doesn't allow it to demonstrate this capability which is disappointing.Maybe this place needs a visit from Gordon as while not a Kitchen Nightmare, it could definitely be doing better than it is.",

Carnivores - left happy. Vegetarians - left happy. Wine snobs and beer enjoyers - all glowing and hiccuping. My bosses post-cheque - gave me a little pat on the head for booking an affordable four-course meal that nobody could really be snide about (set menu for the holidays, obviously). Plus the service was exceptional, so I got to sit back and enjoy my meal.True, some complained about the location before we got there but they can get stuffed. You take a train and then a train and oh look, river front meal. The view's lovely, the night was beautiful even though it was raining. In your face.My one and only problem came with booking for a large party. If you're booking for big numbers, you don't deal with the pub directly but go through the Ramsay Empire which I can only guess is located somewhere on the Death Star or similar. Since they're organising hundreds of reservations for all the many establishments sprung fully formed from Gordon Ramsay's substantial forehead, it takes many phone calls and emails just to get them to respond before they give your precious time slot away to some other group of hair-splitting, drunken colleagues. They were nice, but overwhelmed. It wouldn't kill him to hire a few extra Stormtroopers for November and December.",

    "text": "Location: \u00a0The Narrow is located off a main commuter road out of the city and in the midst of the Limehouse district, a well known historic hamlet of merchant houses on the northern side of the Thames. \u00a0A taxi from Westminister took 30 minutes at 6:30PM so I'd recommend the high speed ferry to Canary, a short walk. \u00a0A true pub atmosphere, the building appears to be a former dock house situated before a small bridge and right on the Thames river. \u00a0Walking down a staircase, a diner has the option to enjoy drinks inside or outside or pub grub in an enclosed conservatory or smaller inner rooms. The decor, establishment and service is friendly albeit ordinary which first led me to wonder, why did I come out of the city to dine at a pub? \u00a0Once I started reading the menu and tasting the food, I was led to understand this establishment was anthing but ordinary. \u00a0The menu could be called, \"A Variation on the Theme of Pub Food\" as it offers interesting twists and combinations in line with favorite pub creations with a personal twist. \u00a0Friends and I shared several dishes. \u00a0I will whole heartedly recommend the roast pig and black pudding appetizer followed by the potato cake / duck egg and smoked trout. \u00a0The main meals of Toad in the Hole, Hake & Chips and Chicken breast all offered the quality incredients, well prepared flavors and warm flavors one should expect from modern British fare. \u00a0Finally we could not resist the opportunity for a Knickerbocker Glory, brownie with ice cream and bread pudding wiht run raisin ice cream. \u00a0Spoons down the clear favorite was the bread pudding - \u00a0a must try! \u00a0It was warm, soft, moist and paired perfectly with custard. \u00a0 If you're around and about town, don't miss an opportunity to dine overlooking the Thames, dress in casual clothes and post-modern pub grub.",

    "text": "This used to be my local favourite but after our last experience, I wont be returning nor recommending this place. We arrived around 8:30pm without reservations and were seated immediately even though they seemed like they were quite busy. \u00a0Not long after being seated, our orders were taken and not long after we had our drinks. I ordered the tortilla fried chicken wings and my fianc\u00e9e ordered the pea and mint soup. All tasted fine as usual. The chicken was served in a bowl but I was not provided a plate in case I wanted to share or place the chicken bones. I chalked it up to the waiter being busy and I carried on. Then our plates were cleared. \u00a0After 15 minutes the waiter came back around and said your mains will be out shortly. We were engrossed in our conversation and carried on talking and talking and talking until I realised hmm, we've talked a lot! It was now quite dark on the patio, other diners who arrived after us were paying for their meals, the large party of 8 seated behind us who arrived after us were happily digging into dessert and even going out to the patio to enjoy an after dinner cigarette. \u00a0I got the waiters attention and asked him about our food and he said it was coming shortly. I pressed further noting all the tables around us that had arrived later and were now gone or paying for their meals. After a very pregnant pause, he glanced around nervously and said he'd be right back. \u00a0Our food finally arrived (right before we were about to ask for the bill and walk out). \u00a0The waiter finally came back and explained that their usual order process was not followed - he had told a colleague to relay the order to the chef and the chef had forgotten and etc etc. basically we got the story of a breakdown of the inner workings of a restaurant rather than an apology. \u00a0As he walked us through how the error had happened he promised a manager would come see us and kept glancing at another employee a few feet away who looked like a manager from his non uniform attire and who seemed quite engrossed in our conversation from a distance. \u00a0The dress shirt and slacks clad employee listened intently from a distance while polishing silverware but never came closer, nor did the promised manager ever appear. We hurriedly finished our food as we were starving and were offered a dessert menu which we declined just wanting to get out of there already. \u00a0The waiter felt so bad that he offered us both a \"free and special\" dessert which wasn't even one of the desserts in the menu and it wasn't something that could be easily whipped up so I'm not sure where that came from.As our consolation, we were not charged for our mains, only the starters and drinks.I didn't make a bigger deal out of the situation because errors happen, it was a relatively busy evening and I didn't want the poor guy to get fired on my account although he seemed to be pretty slow overall. \u00a0What did annoy me and why I won't be returning is that no one took responsibility and if we had not confronted them re the massive wait for the food they would have carried on as if nothing had happened. It took me flagging the guy down and pointing to other people to get the story and my food! The manager who is ultimately responsible for things going awry in the restaurant hid like a coward and never confronted the situation. That's why I will not be returning to the narrow. \u00a0Maybe Gordon Ramsay needs to focus less on Kitchen Nightmares in the US and look a bit closer to home.",

I'm still trying to work out in what world rosemary goes with fish. But it doesn't. To highlight this, exactly the same bun was used on my friends burger. It didn't work with that either. And while the tartare sauce was tasty, it was ruined by throwing a whole load of coleslaw in the bun as well. So what you have is a great bar snack ruined with poshness. The staff are nice here. After my friend managed the spectacularly throw his meal on the floor (we were eating in the bar, on sofas, which wasn't very clever), they kindly replaced his fries when he tried his luck. Actually, there wasn't a moment when the staff weren't friendly and helpful. But we were there all night and they only came to clear the tables around us once. That's not cool. Thing is, we were only here because The Grapes up the road was too busy. I'd only come back here for that very reason.",

Seems like just another place that can take advantage of the view to serve OK food and jack up prices on drinks. Service was kind of weird - seemed like we were more of a nuisance than customers. I had asked my waiter to sub the chips for mash with my fish and chips (where he informed me that fish and chips are a British tradition, thanks captain obvious) so I went with his 'reco' and was disappointed by them as I've had much better for much cheaper.Other dishes I tried - the pork belly and oxtail - were good, but nothing spectacular. My fish was tasty and fresh, but didn't compare to Sausalito's Fish. I'd also say the pseudo-British pub I worked at in Danville might give them a run for their money. I really wanted this place to be a winner on all accounts, but it was kind of a let down in the gastro dept. I also really wanted Gordon Ramsay to redeem his a-hole behavior and reputation from American TV with an excellent dining experience but, that didn't happen either. However, I'll go back, definitely for a drink and the view, especially when it gets warmer and the patio opens up.",

    "text": "So having relocated from Glasgow to London, this is now my local. What is it with the lack of pubs in Shadwell/Limehouse! Missing a trick there guys...hard-worked commuters need their bevvy more than anyone I would have thought...anyway, in my research about the area I had noticed this and bookmarked it, and have been a few times. What I really like is that you can just go for a drink - silly I realise, but I did genuinely just think it was a restaurant! Furthermore, the patio is brilliant, and it does feel nice and plush to be sitting on actual cushions instead of plastic seats. A very civilised place to have a glass of wine. Also the house white is very nice and good value for money.The food...is pretty damn good. Having only had the fish and chips, I was pleased to see that they used haddock (so sick of cod and 'river cobbler' other places...what the heck is river cobbler?!) and the chips came at least twice-cooked = YUM. However, in my humble opinion the fish should be breaded, as the batter was just soggy, nor did the fact it was beer-battered add any flavour. Plus...and this to me is a bit of a sin...no HP or brown sauce!! Is this a Scottish thing? I'm not sure, but I know that tartare sauce is nice, but is not as POW as HP sauce...Also, inside I found that the windows/blinds could use a bit of a clean, and were quite well-inhabited with spiders and cobwebs...get the hoover and duster out Gordon.Will be back, and will report on what else is on the menu...",

The Savoy Grill is a little out of my price range, so we opted for The Narrow instead. It is a little out of the way, but once we got there we enjoyed every minute of it.They seated us on the patio so we had an excellent view of the river and a perfect sunset. For an app, I got the crab on toast. There was a TON of crab on that toast. It was good, but I don't know about \u00a312 for crab on toast. My friend got the scallops and really loved them.For mains I was really in the mood for a burger, so I went for it. It was very good. Cooked perfectly and really flavorful beef. Totally recommend if you are looking for a burger. The special of the night was a beef wellington so that is what my friend got. How could she pass up the signature dish for her b-day celebration? She loved it.And while we were both quite full from all of the food and wine that we had already consumed, we decided to get some puddings. I got the special which was homemade donuts with a caramel/chocolate dipping sauce. The donuts were ok, but I would be happy to have more of that dipping sauce. My friend won in the battle of desserts with the Knickerbocker glory. I have no idea of what all was in it, but it was incredible. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if for some reason, you are in the neighborhood it is a nice place to grab a meal.",

However, the recent overhaul has left much to be desired... They only serve 2/3 pints now, which seems a cynical way to ramp up the prices. The outdoor area has been overhauled and feels somewhat more pretentious with the wicker furniture - bring back the picnic tables! The food has always been pretty pricey and a bit hit and miss - I've had some lovely meals but have also had a pasta dish which was so salty I couldn't eat it. The indoor area is, however, gorgeous and the espresso martinis are highly recommended!",

We had booked a table and really wanted a conservatory seat as it was the last day of her trip and birthday. The conservatory was full but they arranged for us to have a drink on the patio and wait till a seat became available for our dinner, and were so kind and understanding and came to the patio no more than 30 minutes later to tell us they'd squeezed us in. Our waitress was so sweet and helped us with the menu - the food came out perfect and we LOVED the artichoke soup starter. THEN my boyfriend needed to print tickets we had ordered online for a boat ride and didn't get to print so the manager came and brought us the laptop to print them!! Honestly we were not the easiest group tonight but they made it so lovely I will be coming here again with my coworkers and friends whenever I get the chance. (And promise to be a simpler customer!)

We all ate roast dinners and they were great value, extremely tasty and delicious and very filling. We also enjoyed a lovely bottle (or two if I remember correctly ;-) ) of red and some beautiful desserts - my bread and butter pudding was the envy of the table and we all enjoyed an aperitif too. After this we decided to move into the pub part and have a drink or two there and although a little pricey, as you would expect for a gastropub and not least a Gordon Ramsay one, there was a great atmosphere and I would definitely return and recommend The Narrow.",

    "text": "The Narrow is a beautiful unsuspecting restaurant in the Limehouse area of London. \u00a0It looks like nothing from the street but when you go down the stairs, you enter a very beautiful restaurant on the river Thames.We stayed in Paddington so we took the underground to the overground then caught an Uber from the train station to the restaurant. \u00a0It was pretty easy and worth the couple modes of transportation.The Narrow is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. \u00a0We knew we wanted to try one while we were in London and quite frankly, it had the best sounding menu and was much more affordable than some other choices. \u00a0It was also nice that the restaurant is on the river so you also get beautiful views while you dine.When we entered, we were asked if we had reservations, we said no and the host was very kind and found us an amazing table next to the large windows so we could see the river. \u00a0I was shocked we were able to get such a nice table with no reservations. \u00a0The host also made conversation with us and was very welcoming.When we sat down we were given menus. \u00a0We each ordered a diet coke and some water and bread with butter. \u00a0We then decided on fish and chips for our main and sticky toffee pudding for dessert. \u00a0We even asked for Yorkshire Pudding to go and they even obliged that!  First off, the bread and butter were great. \u00a0The bread was obviously freshly baked and slightly warm. \u00a0Our order included four pieces of bread, two of each variety so we each got to try the different types.Next, we had the fish and chips. \u00a0I was debating between that and a roast they had that day, mainly because I wanted to try the Yorkshire Pudding but I also really wanted some good fish and chips and I was figuring this restaurant wouldn't disappoint. \u00a0It was wonderful! \u00a0The fish was so fresh and hot! \u00a0The batter was light and crisp with a good amount of flavor. \u00a0The chips were prefect. \u00a0Crispy yet pillow soft on the inside. \u00a0The mushy peas were interesting, just not my thing and the tartare sauce was literally the best I have ever had. \u00a0They really need to jar it so you can take some home. \u00a0It was awesome!Finally we had decided we wanted to try Sticky Toffee Pudding. \u00a0It was served with a salted caramel ice cream. \u00a0It was so rich, my sister and I shared it and it was definitely enough for both of us. \u00a0It was excellent!Our Yorkshire Pudding was also wonderful! \u00a0Light, airy and crispy on the outside. \u00a0It was so dang good!The service was impeccable. \u00a0The views were beautiful and our entire lunch was delightful. \u00a0The restaurant definitely did not disappoint at all! \u00a0I would happily return!",

Nice Gloucestershire butter - yum.Had the Camden Pale Ale (just so so) and the London Pride Cask Ale (better than the Camden).Ordered 2 hanger steaks (served with chips and rocket/tomato salad), a side of cole slaw, and the special - ribeye with chips, and rocket/tomato salad, and a side of Caesar salad.All steaks were ordered medium rare. All were what we would consider redder than normal for medium rare. One of the hanger steaks was way, way rare. The peppercorn sauce was good, the chips were very crispy, and good. The rocket and tomato was good. The cole slaw was a bit too creamy/goopy for our tastes (we like ours more lightly dressed). The Caesar salad was good, but also a bit overly dressed. (Maybe a British thing to saturate salads with too much dressing? 3rd restaurant in 3 days that did that)Told the waiter at the end of dinner about the too-rare steak. He said hanger steaks are tough to get right because of the varying thickness of the meat. I don't know about that - had hanger steaks in many places cooked medium rare that were just fine.All in all, nice place, nice atmosphere, good service, food just ok.",

Menus were brought promptly and our drink orders were taken. \u00a0 We were then offered bread and butter which we say yes too. \u00a0It was a nice start to our lunch.My sister and I both ordered the fish and chips. \u00a0The food arrived after about 20 minutes with everything pipping hot. \u00a0The fish was fresh and crisp, the fries perfectly cooked. Everything was wonderful and the freshly made tartar sauce was exceptional. \u00a0I've never had a better tartar sauce. \u00a0We also ordered Yorkshire Pudding to go because we love Yorkshire Pudding and very badly wanted to try some while we were in England. \u00a0The server graciously gave us some to take with us. \u00a0For dessert we ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding to share. \u00a0It was wonderful. \u00a0It was extremely rich and sweet but I thought it was the perfect ending to our meal. \u00a0The food was wonderful, service was great and the view beautiful. \u00a0If I return to London I would not hesitate to return to The Narrow.",

It was quite a ways from our hotel but was worth the drive for this beautiful setting!We didn't have a reservation so we started out with some drinks and appies at the bar until a table on the patio opened up!The service was great...we asked to order our food family style. They weren't sure what we meant by that but once explained they were very accommodating! We ordered a few mains and some sides to go with...sharing it all! This is such a fun way to sample more of the menu! The Bangers and Mash was very tasty. Had a fun leisurely evening of good food, drinks and much laughter at The Narrows.",

Not a lot of room for improvement, but I guess everyone can improve. Great place to sit on the Thames and watch the world go by. A lot of good famous people watching in this place...

When you cook rib eye you have to get it on a very high heat to sear it and break down the sinew that surrounds the eye otherwise the steak is a bit limp, fatty and chewy...well guess what I was served. The supposed medium rare was very rare and as it hadn't seen a hot pain the fat was stringy and not pleasant. The mash was non-existent...instead supermarket chips and the peppercorn sauce was a rather lacklustre gravy.The desert was a pear and berry crumble, pleasant enough but the fruit was undercooked and the clotted cream ice-cream underwhelming. Gordon Ramsay put his name to this place!!! Not sure what he has been up to as they are having a real kitchen nightmare! Celeb chefs cant expect punters to pay based on their name if the food isn't going to match up to the price!",

    "text": "I've lived in the Limehouse/Canary Wharf area for three years now and finally made my way to The Narrow last weekend for what I thought would be a nice Saturday afternoon lunch.Before I say anything else, The Narrow is a beautiful pub. It's situated right on the Thames and has a gorgeous light and bright interior. You can see the Shard from the window and watch boats pass by - it's a very lovely place to sit on a sunny afternoon.Now, on to the food. This is where things started going south for me. I knew going into The Narrow that this was going to be pricier than your average pub (Gordon's got to make his money somehow). I was still a bit surprised, however, when I ordered a bowl of chowder for \u00a37 and was presented with a tiny ramequin of cloudy salt water filled with celery. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend ordering the soup.In an attempt to eat somewhat healthily, I also ordered a 'side of greens.' What I got was yet another tiny ramequin of boiled kale. It wasn't seasoned. It wasn't even cut up! It was just gigantic rubbery leaves of kale. My boyfriend order the lamb, and while it was admittedly better than my cloudy water and leaves, it was as close to flavourless as lamb allows. The broth was really thin and the vegetables were bland. This is not what you'd expect for \u00a318.50.Will I be back? Not for the food. I might come back next summer when the weather is nice to enjoy a pint by the river. I may even spring for a side of chips, but I definitely will not be ordering any more entrees.",

    "text": "The Narrow is a bit out of the way, but sometimes that works to the benefit of a place, as I think it does here. Stopped in here for the first time a while ago, on Easter Sunday when they had an optional set course for the holiday, but I have been back for the regular menu as well. The upstairs is a bit quieter, and the view is lovely, although we did end up waiting about a half hour for the bill once, which may be less likely downstairs. The food itself was fine. I think we went in with expectations which were met, but not exceeded. Basically, for the price bracket, it is as it should be. The roasts were particularly good, and portions generous. There is also a nice bar, and outdoor seating for those few months when that might be toerable.",

Reservations are a must as they looked very busy. The asparagus appetizer was refreshing and had a delicious whole grain mustard vinaigrette. The grilled sole was perfectly cooked and slightly crispy with a really yummy parsley butter. I really wanted to try the Minted pea soup with ham hock and cheddar croquettes. Maybe next time!Wye valley asparagus with radish, lambs lettuce and vinaigretteWhole grilled lemon sole, parsley butterThe Narrow short rib burger, Monterey jack cheese, bacon, skinny chips",

    "text": "Oh dear.My friend and I went to The Narrow, and right from the off, the service left much to be desired. We were stood waiting for a good 5-10 minutes before our presence was even acknowledged by the staff. And then when we were seated, the waitress just dropped a couple of menus on the table and wandered off, not to be seen again until we ventured away from our table to find someone who would be so kind to take our order for us. We kinda got the impression that we weren't the kind of people they wanted around..And then the food. The asparagus was too hard, the duck egg tasted... not good. And my main course - a lamb rump - was more like lamb rubber. Considering Gordon Ramsey puts his name to this establishment, this was a huge disappointment.After settling the bill, which was extortionate for what the meal and service was, we left The Narrow. And will never be returning.",

The staff treated us so well, good drinks, great atmosphere and good food. I love the view and the location at the banks of thames, wishing to go back to London this year and will absolutely return to the Narrow!",

The atmosphere is laid back but sophisticated. Their wine list is pretty vast and the food was wonderful. The service was attentive enough and didn't leave anything to be desired for. I would definitely come back to enjoy a nice sunny afternoon or evening.",
