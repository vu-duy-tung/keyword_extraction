The layout and decor and extremely cool - a cross between a sophisticated tree house, a dungeon and a boudoir - with windy stairs, different rooms on different levels and windy stairs with chains as banisters. The menu is not hugely imaginative - steak, fishcakes, pork belly etc but the food is very tasty. They do great cocktails. Despite this is only get's a 3 rating for the following reasons. It's quite pricey, very packed and the service is pretty poor. It's not a surprise that's it pricey - the location and clientele indicate it's not going to be a cheap night out, but you expect better service for that price. The doorman heckles women with leery compliments on the way in, the waiters flirt inappropriately when you're trying to enjoy your friends' company and you can't move through the bar without being elbowed. The service is very slow - 3 hours for a drink in the bar, main course and dessert. The bar bill was \u00a368 for 5 cocktails - one of which included the worst caipirinha ever tasted. If I'd been bolshier I would have withheld the wholly undeserved 12.5% service charge, but sadly I didn't. Despite all that - it was a great night. Great location, great food and really great company.",

Entering this restaurant is to enter a fantasyland of gothic glamour. The bar area leads down to cave-like rooms, adding to the sense of flamboyance.Dress to impress when you come to this place as the crowd is well turned out, and even the waitresses are jaw-to-the-floor stunning.We started with cocktails in the bar, before led down to our 'cave' - a stoned walled room down winding stairs to our table.The food here is lovely, although not outstanding. If anything, it's the ambience that adds to the evening, you feel like you are somewhere truly special. Our meal of 2 mains, and 2 desserts, with a bottle of wine came to \u00a3120 with service, so the place isn't particularly cheap, but for a special occasion it is well worth the visit.",

    "text": "Beach Blanket Babylon is a magical gothic-inspired bar and restaurant nestled in a Georgian House in the heart of Nottinghill. A playground for Nottinghill's rich and beautiful, well-heeled socialites and fashionistas unwind in the sumptuous upstairs bar with potent cocktails shaken and stirred by attentive staff members sexy enough to give Brad Pitt and Gisele a run for their money. While casually posing, one can savour the tastefully decadent d\u00e9cor of columns, marble busts, urns and topiary. Strategically-placed candles and chandeliers draw one's eye to the plethora of 17th Century cabinets dripping with vintage costume jewelry crafted by designers such as Christian Dior and Chanel. If overwhelmed by the sensory overload, lower yourself into an oversized leather armchair and forget your cares while indulging in stimulating conversation with your entourage. If the intoxicating environment has left you in need of fresh air, step out onto the welcoming patio area and kick back at one of the petite iron tables which afford the perfect opportunity for watching the world go by. The restaurant comprises several rooms interconnected by walkways, tunnels, bridges and staircases aptly named The Chapel, Crypt and Scullery Gallery. Delve deep into the basement floor of the restaurant and you will find yourself in The Crypt- a jewel of a restaurant filled with numerous nooks and crannies ideal for an intimate meal. The central focus of this subterranean oasis is a beautiful open fire place that casts a warm glow upon the stone walls and completes the inviting old-world atmosphere. BBB is one of the few restaurants that harmoniously blends historic dining with modern sophistication, ensuring that even the most discerning of Londoners are certain to enjoy an ethereal experience at this urban gem.",

From the moment you walk through the door you have to squash past huge cherubs and statues of Greek gods and push your way through decorative branches to make your way to the bar. This place always reminds me of a scene form Midsummer Night's Dream, it really does feel magical. The cocktail menu is as varied as they come and they are delicious but they do come at a price. I have never eaten here but if the cocktails are anything to go by then I'm sure it's delicious! The wine list is also far-reaching, the house rose is particularly nice. The staff in here are a beautiful as the crowds it attracts and are efficient too. Long waits for drinks are sometimes unavoidable though due to the sheer volume of people in such a small space. My only other criticism of this place is that there are no other watering holes within a short walk, making BBB a destination bar really somewhere beautiful to wile away your whole evening!",

My girlfriend ordered the quail egg asparagus and hollandaise appetizer. It was AWFUL. The asparagus was cold, the egg was overcooked and the hollandaise tasted like partially melted margarine or the cheap imitation stuff. Then, WE FOUND A BIG CHUNK OF Facial TISSUE in the dish. GROSS. The Manager Johnny who was totally unsympathetic, tried to make excuses why it was in there and basically said it was a restaurant \"it happens.\" He did take it off the bill though. When my girlfriend's goat cheese salad arrived it came WITHOUT the goat cheese. So we sent it back and waited again. When the dish came back the addition of the goat cheese didn't really help. Another terrible dish. The leaves had a grainy sand like texture like they HADN'T BEEN WASHED PROPERLY. So at this point we just wanted to leave. It was such a disappointing dinning experience that I asked to speak to Johnny again. Again he was no help, just making more excuses why the food and service was so poor and being down right rude to us. Johnny didn't offer to remove the salad from the bill. Instead he took the service charge off, which I asked him not to because I still wanted to leave our waitress a tip. It wasn't her fault after all. I gave up, paid and left. Needless to say I will never be returning there. Terrible over priced food. RUDE manager.",

Me and my best friend started out in Portobello road, we ventured through Kensington, Notting Hill, we then sat and drank at All Bar One and then was joined by my partner who introduced us to this place Beach, Blanket and Babylon. I think I wanted to write about this place just because I love it's name. How cool is that name?This place, lets call it BBB's is a cocktail bar, the drinks are extortionately priced and I think that three cocktails whacked up a thirty seven pound bill! But of course, I thoroughly enjoyed my cocktail and we were honoured by the presence of the trendy Notting Hill aura! Ultimately this place is just a cocktail bar, music and dancing is not a big feature more so than it is to get dressed up, leave your house, have a chat, be seen and of course have a cocktail. The d\u00e9cor has a kind of Arabic/ Moroccan theme and is beautifully decorated. A restaurant area is situated in the back of the bar, sadly we didn't hang out here long enough to eat, but if you fancy a meal and a cocktail or even just like the name of this place, you should check it out!",

The decor inside was very stylish and I daresay one of the most over the top I've seen that is NOT in Las Vegas. The bar area seemed to be the place to be, but we had dinner reservations so we were literally escorted across a plank-bridge through the restaurant to get to our table in the back, and yes I literally mean out \"back\". It was a busy Saturday night in London after all but I appreciated the service here as they put together a private patio dining area for 2, which was pretty romantic for the two of us gazing up at the London stars. The menu has your standard affair of meat, fish and pasta items, and I would say the food was good, but nothing I particularly found memorable. \u00a0But really to me the experience here is more about the atmosphere of the restaurant and for us as tourists it was great people watching; seeing and being-seen among the evening London crowd.",

The service was pretty nondescript and they pretty much left us alone, which was good and bad - mostly bad only when we wanted to order another drink. \u00a0The smoking area is teeny tiny, so watch out if you're a smoker because it get super crowded. Although the mood is right for a date, this is definitely also a prime pickup joint...on the particular night we were there we saw plenty of well-dressed men making the approach. \u00a0So even though I would highly recommend this place as a prime venue to impress a gal (as another reviewer did) ... just know that if you're in the lounge you may have some competition!",

    "text": "If you want to see beautiful people, drink exotic cocktails, being surrounded by an extraordinaire place, which has tendency to kitsch, Beach Blanket Babylon in the heart of Notting Hill, will meet your expectations - if you are a man take your girl for a first date here.This bar gets packed in the evening. Freshly flowers are decorating the room, fireplaces are lighted and a DJ is working the chill out sound. I happened to go there for drinks in the afternoon and evening. Don't ask for tea \u00a0- this is not an afternoon tea place, but that would be a shame anyway, this place is for cocktails!If you are someone who enjoys discovering hot spots pleasing your eye there is lots to discover at BBB. There is petite garden, where the smokers socialise. Also another section is reserved for the restaurant only. The staircase is winding itself smartly up onto different levels of the house. To me it is a mix between Mowgly in the jungle and Persian mosaic. It almost makes you feel to walk into a surrealistic Dali painting.If you happen to go out on the other side of the city, the same concept has been drawn up by the same owners, who you always see checking in from time to time ensuring if everything is living up to the standards they want it to - I believe they do a good job. One question I do have - I would like to compare the customers from the east BBB with the West BBB - they both like expensive cocktails but like to claim to live the opposite lifestyle.",

    "text": "This is the original BBB and actually has quite a different vibe from the one in Shoreditch. I haven't been to LA but I reckon on the outside it's a bit LA inspired, maybe LA wedding in Malibu. I haven't been to a wedding in years either and the last contact I had with Malibu was by way of a coke so this is tenuous maybe but it makes sense, the beach in the title certainly isn't in Notting Hill is it?Inside the bar area is all fresh flowers, decadence, baroque style with great original lighting and fireplaces. Mostly it's all about the cocktails here, the list and the mix is pretty good and they're nice and heavy on the alcohol. There is nothing worse than bars thinking they can get cheap with the spirits because in a cocktail glass you won't realize. Especially when they don't come in cheap. There's also a great little smoking area at the front - needless to say all of it gets really busy most nights and it's totally packed on weekends.",

I had walked past before and had not really thought much of it - however I am very glad that I made the effort to go there...it was great! I am a real cocktail fan and Beach Blanket Babylon did not disappoint. I started with a well made Classic Champagne Cocktail, which for some inextricable reason, Beach Blanket Babylon refer to as the 'Paris Hilton'. Whoever this Paris bloke is, I do not know, but I refused to refer to it as anything other than a Classic Champagne Cocktail, much to the bartender's prissy, jobsworth disgust. Jewel, however make superior Classic Champagne Cocktails - cheaper too! I continued my way down the formidable Beach Blanket Babylon cocktail menu - and I enjoyed every one that I tried. I do however, really feel sorry for the owners of Beach Blanket Babylon, they must be really hard-up. Otherwise, why would a high-end bar in Notting Hill not accept AMEX? Cheapskates! The over the top tack decor is great. If you are bored waiting to use the toilet, they have though fully provided a game for people to play - you unscrew all of the light bulbs and make the place really dark. It wiles away countless minutes waiting time. In an unrelated query, my friend and I could not for the life of us figure why we woke up the next day with our fingers feeling as though they had been burnt. I will be back to Beach Blanket Babylon, it was a lot better than I expected and not as terrifyingly expensive as it could have been. Yay! I'm a fan.",

It's great when they've got a DJ blaring and loads of people dancing. If you really want to move around, head to the BBB in Shoreditch. BBB is also lovely for lunch and dinner. With extravagant decor and many rooms & floors, you're guaranteed a fantastic time.Definitely try the cocktails. It's always fun to go in with friends and order a bunch of drinks and try them all out. Have a Fu Manchu or Mojito!Be sure to give BBB a whirl while in London town!",

I was mightily impressed by it when it wasn't too busy which was only heightened when I went on a night out - it is simply stunning and I can't think why anyone wouldn't like it.The fireplace makes it homely without being too loungy or cosy. The decor is very arty - lots of elaborate antique style chairs and tables and candle holders. The restaurant area on the lower level is beautiful and not as loud or hectic as the bar area.The crowd is very kitsch and typical of Notting Hill folk, and the cocktails are lovely but very very strong! I was nearly knocked out by my one Mai Thai so yes it is expensive, but if you are on the cocktails you won't need too many! (A little secret; if you are a fan of Big Brother, one of the recent contestant's Rex always went on about his restaurants - Beach Blanket Babylon is one of them. I have to say - he hasn't done a bad job!).",

It is amazing inside and out, something that Bruce Wayne would be happy to reside in.I sat and ate an overpriced meal, and felt a little guilty because I spent \u00a312 on a starter that I could have made better, and as for the main meal, I had the Duck and it was nothing special at all, not worth \u00a320 any way. It may have been a case of being a bad day for the Chef at back, because I thought that it was going to be amazing, but the food really did not live up to the standards of the d\u00e9cor.Everything on the menu sounds mouth watering but just let down, and as for the drinks, over priced is an understatement. Perhaps they are just trying to keep the riffraff out. None the less, amazing to look at, perhaps go there and ask for tap water, then again, that might set you back a fiver.",

Second of all the cocktails here are amazing, and \u00a0I tried a lot of them on Saturday night (although I found the Catherine Deneuve quite sour). Third of all I really enjoyed the food, great burger, and those chips made me want to stop dieting and become fat forever. I also had a really good time at Beachhouse. So why the 3 stars you ask. Well first of all the menu was paltry. In fact the burger \u00a0was the only meat option there with the exception of a \u00a365 chateaubriand for two. Second of all the waiting staff were a little snotty. I order an avocado tartar as a starter and what it actually was was guacamole with tortilla chips, false advertising or what! We waited quite a long time for our food, all the straters came at different times, and they did apologize for the long wait but they also looked quite stressed and grumpy (well one woman in particular). They also stopped serving beer after 5pm, which meant that all you could buy were spirits cocktails and champagne. Now I'm not strapped for cash but at \u00a370 for a round of drinks I was leaving early. If you want somewhere that's really lavish, looks great, is full of notting hill yahs and will leave a massive hole in your pocket this is the place.",

The restaurant boasts a very sexy interior with chandeliers, fireplaces and furniture that would make Marie Antoinette go red with envy. Sadly, BBB is not really all about food. Don't get me wrong, my veggie starter and my risotto main were great, but they just weren't what you'd expect from BBB. Maybe it's the interior and the service that set the bar too high, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's not food that will keep you coming back, it's the atmosphere.

Weird enough being the only people in the entire lower floor, but why seat us next to the kitchen door? We asked to move and ended up in the far back room, all alone, which was also weird, but fine. The decor is a little unusual- pirate ship meets Liberace, which we could see to be entertaining were it packed, but empty felt like a scene from the Count of Monte Cristo. Food was really underwhelming. Ordered the absurdly over-salted steak tartare, ok duck and mediocre ragout. There seemed to be a general lack of attention to detail (like gin&tonics in a wine glass with giant straws) that didn't do justice to what this place could be. The only highlight was the excellent service; everyone was lovely. Could see how sitting at the bar for a drink would be fun, that said time to rethink food menu and decor.",

We went to the cocktail bar behind it called lounge lovers I think, and it wasn't good - the staff were very slow, and the cocktails were large and neon, and poorly made.",

I never hold my breath for these kinds of things, as catering for 35-40 people in one go is tough.Well boy, was I surprised. Sure, the length in between courses was too long, but the food was delicious.Homemade bread to start was a treat, then I had beautiful scallops cooked to perfection and a HUGE fillet steak. I'm a steak and red wine kind of girl, but I couldn't finish it! It was ginormous. But very tasty, served with potato rosti and spinach.Sadly I had to leave before dessert, but as I wandered downstairs to the ladies and out through the bar, I mentally noted that I had to take my boyfriend there for another trip.",

However, after a nice dinner at Electric and with the promise of extra delicious porn star martinis, my hosts convinced me venture off to BBB.Upon arrival, instant surprises. First, there are no theatrics... except, of course, those of the patrons themselves. This lounge feels like a dive into Atlantis. With gems, gold, and lavish furniture sprawled through the multi-level venue, I began to feel like a bit of a Mermaid. Then came the porn star martinis. Delicious passion fruit floating in a champagne concoction... I was in love. I highly recommend taking a plunge into Notting Hill's Beach Blanket Babylon.",

The interior is considerably tacky and gaudy with chains, plush and fake-baroque elements incorporated into the design; it looks like it was designed to attract nouveau riche people with an addiction to 80s Versace.It is a fairly big establishment, but since it consists of so many different corners, rooms and basements, it feels decently intimate. The music seemed alright (mostly 80s when I attended), but it is slightly too loud to have a nice drink and a conversation. The drinks menu is all right with a focus on mixers, and hardly any \"manly\" drinks. Service varied significantly from being overly attentive to neglecting our table completely. Prices are not on the cheap side, but considering the location and crowd, they seemed moderate.",

    "text": "Generally, I don't exactly *like* this kind of place. Having said that, I really enjoyed myself at BBB. We went here for my lady's birthday and I was extremely impressed with how BBB handled the whole evening. We reserved a small section for 8:30pm for 15-20 people. We arrived and the host showed us to our spot where we had a couch, two tables and a bunch of chairs. On the tables were reservation cards with the birthday girl's name right on there. Throughout the night we never had trouble getting our servers to take orders and I just thought BBB was incredibly accomodating.The lounge itself is nice, very kitschy. The music ranged from trite 80's to Spice Girls to modern house - all very popular with the ladies. I'm a wine and beer guy, and since this is absolutely NOT a place for beer, I stuck to wine. You can get a fine bottle of red or white for about \u00a324.50 or so. (The house wines are around \u00a320.) I can't really comment on the mixed drinks as that's not my area of expertise and I didn't have any at BBB. Although, I did see some mixed drinks and they looked attractive, and I think the people drinking them enjoyed them. We also had some nibbles, like antipasto and some fried seafood or something. It was good, anyway.So, overall, I was very happy with BBB. Upscale in terms of location, ambience and drinks, but not prohibitively expensive. And I really do think the staff was fantastic. Very friendly and professional. I would say this is a great place for a date or a birthday party. Check it out.",

Not only did the manager, Brett, locate it and set it aside, he came DIRECTLY to our hotel and hand delivered it to us! He absolutely saved our vacation!

    "text": "Entering BBB is an experience in itself, with high ceilings, beautiful artwork and a fireplace to keep you toasty. The interior and Vibe of BBB makes you feel very cosy and at home.I started my night with drinks at the bars in front of one of the fireplaces with a friend of mine.My chosen poison was a magic memory, my friend is currently moving to Manchester, so I did indeed want this night to be a memory that I can remember! The cocktail consists of Portobello road gin, gooseberry syrup, lime, prosecco. This drink is sweet to the tongue with a gin kick at the end. I didn't know it at the time but this would be my go-to drink for the evening. If you love a sweet gin cocktail then this is a must-have!For dinner, we headed to a secluded spot upstairs with our own personal waiter. To start my meal, I went for the drowning prawn. Which is served in a bowl of lobster bisque, tiger prawn, julienne apple, caviar. The bisque is creamy, thick and full of flavour, alongside the prawn which is completely saturated in the bisque. Although, the Caviar is a small portion, it still adds an extra crunch to the soup. However, due to this dish's creamy nature, it can become a little overwhelming to consume the entire dish.For starters, I also tried the beef carpaccio, served with rocket, parmesan, truffle oil. As I don't eat Parmesan, I took the cheese of the rocket, however that did not deter from the dish as the beef was well seasoned and the truffle oil made the beef carpaccio a little dish of luxury.For my main, I had the fillet of beef, served with saut\u00e9ed spinach, dauphinoise potato, wild mushroom jus. I haven't tried dauphinoise potatoes before, so this was a real treat for me. Sliced potatoes baked in milk from the Dauphin\u00e9 region in south-east France, the potatoes are very sweet but not too milky. I chose my beef fillet to be cooked medium-rare, making the beef melt in my mouth. If you love beef, you will love the fillet as it is very succulent and well seasoned. The wild mushrooms are a little on the tangy side but are paired well with the beef.After dinner, we proceeded downstairs for more drinks by the fire. The magic memories cocktail definitely made my night sweeter and more exciting. Overall I enjoyed my experience at BBB, the staff are friendly and very accommodating with quick service and beautifully presented food.Price: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3What to wear: Smart Casual(I wore jeans jacket, jumper, jeans and heels)Ambience: Accommodating staff with a laid back home feel. Majority of diners are locals.",

They knew I was going to book it and they went ahead with someone else absolutely abysmal!Maybe it's for the best since the whole pace is crawling with roaches look it up on google multiple traps set with live roaches in them. Some were seen at the bar by customers and regulars. Cannot emphasize how awful this place and how they do not care about their loyal customers what so ever. Oh also ALWAYS make sure to check ur bill here since they love to add random \u00a0charges, to the bill of drinks I've not had this has happened to me 3 times which I don't think is a coincidence, and as I said my friends and I used to be regulars here.",

However if you are looking for only two types of salami and 4 wedges of a hard cheese, this is the heaping pile of meat for you. The ragu pappardelle is a solid option. Heritage tomato salad was good too. It had a really great flavor where I found myself dipping the bread in the leftover dressing.

And by that I mean, then, that's it's overpriced and derivative. There are far better places to eat with better service for the prices you'll pay here.One feather in its cap are the cocktails, which were great. But I didn't come here for the cocktails, ergo I left disappointed. You can do better.",

My colleague was familiar with the play and Street from San Francisco, so we were excited to check out the restaurant bearing it's name. We took a seat at a table in the bar, and did our best to wonder around to check out the eclectic decor.Decor: eclectic, interesting, beautiful... Not what I expected in Notting HillFood: delicious. We had squid (calamari), burrata, lamb. The Lamb was fantastic, as was the squid.Drinks: adult beverages were fantastic.",

Regular water top-ups and generally very polite waiters. I had the vegetable green curry, which was delicious despite that I normally can't handle spicy food -- the coconut sauce was to die for. My date had the crispy duck, which is apparently their top seller. I really enjoyed this restaurant experience.",

The food was also decent - when it finally arrived. However, the service ruined it for me. I expect a good service if I am paying over \u00a310 for a cocktail. If you feel the uncontrollable desire to pay this place a visit, ask for Aurora to be your waitress - she know what she's doing. Don't let them place you in the corner. You will join the wonderful furniture.",

    "text": "Nestled in an unassuming residential street, Beach Blanket Babylon is far enough away from the tourist trap of Notting Hill's bustling market and infamous 'Blue (now black) Door', but close enough to Westbourne Grove to attract the local elite set. The interior is a nod to the decadent past of the opulent Rococo and grandiose Baroque style, featuring wall to ceiling sash mirrors, crystal chandeliers and ornate candelabras, although I fail to see where the Boho chic they mention arises, unless they mean the clientele.After being greeted by a gracious enough ma\u00eetre d', we were escorted to the dining area, through what felt like a plank walk on a pirate ship \u00e0 la 'The Goonies', up steep narrow cast iron steps, to a cavernous alcove named 'The Chapel'. There is a vulgar eccentricity to the eclectic mishmash of Gothic arches and Grecian furnishings; the mezza luna shaped table we sat at was highly unconducive to the social setting and we spent most of the meal cranking our necks just to converse with one another.We were presented with a three course set-menu written with the banality of which made a motorway service station menu sound adventurous - a throwback to Heston Blumenthal's reinvention of Little Chef? but given the circumstance, there was little choice but to slip out a wry smile and order. For starter, I opted for scallops with truffle and butternut squash pur\u00e9e. The portion size was modest, nevertheless the scallops were relatively fresh and seared well. Though the taste of truffle was undefined, the butternut squash constituent of the pur\u00e9e perked up an otherwise indifferent starter. (Lamentably, it is exactly this type of entr\u00e9e which seems to be de rigueur of so many mediocre establishments that put far more emphasis on the perceived market value of the ingredients than the quality and concept of a dish). The caramelized red onion and goat's cheese tart that my vegetarian counterparts ordered looked abundantly more appetising but perhaps this was a case of \"grass is greener\" syndrome.My main was prime fillet of beef with baby carrots, oyster mushrooms & garlic herb butter - totally uninspired, but for non-argument's sake, let's call it sustenance for a boozy night ahead. Even so, the fillet was prime and perfectly medium rare to order, unfortunately the baby carrots seemed like they had bypassed the stove between the root cellar and the pass, slung on as an afterthought - a teeth shattering crunch not even the most discerning Leporidae would have approved of. The oyster mushrooms must have had a nosebleed - already quite a 'meaty' fungi, it had no place being on this plate. As for the deplorable 'garlic herb butter emulsion', for one, I am snoring with boredom; for another, I am snoring with boredom. Were it not for the obstinacy of carrying my own pocket sized Tabasco (even Nigella does this), I would not have bothered to finish this course. After some gentle persuasion, I managed to secure a taste of my companion's dish which in comparison had every component part cooked well and complimentary to each other - the pan fried sea bass was served with a superb tomato vinaigrette and an equally divine chestnut pur\u00e9e; the buttered spinach not too watery.Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a traditional yardstick of dessert - a restaurant can excel remarkably or fall dramatically flat on its face with this ubiquitous pot of 'burnt cream'. The one presented to us had a silky texture, was relatively unctuous although the crust could have perhaps done with a few seconds more under the torch to give that reassuring crackle of caramel; passable but nothing memorable.After the meal, we were ushered to our reserved tables in the now heaving 'Grand Banquet Ballroom' bar. Most of the clientele consisted of pretentious swathes of 'new money' types, the aforementioned Boho chic and offspring of Russian oligarchs let loose for the weekend from their paid Oxbridge admissions. The one saving grace were the cocktails, which ebbed and flowed all night to the point where I had to ditch the concept of driving home in favour of 'Scooterman'. The star of the evening, why, a porn star! - The Porn Star Martini, an expertly tended concoction of Cariel vanilla vodka, Passo\u00e1 passion-fruit liqueur, passion-fruit pur\u00e9e, vanilla sugar and citrus syrup, served with a shot of Champagne; created by legendary mixologist Douglas Ankrah and worthy of a bartender's 'Toscar'.In a place where everything is style over substance, the service slightly archaic and the food not worthy of any particular mention, the eventuality of great bar-tending proved that even in the bleakest of social environments, you can still conjure up a great night out. There are plenty of better eateries in the vicinity ('The Ledbury'), but if u relish mixing with the trendy set and want a good night's retox [sic], just aim for the bar after a meal elsewhere.(Edited from 'Detective Chan's Culinary Adventures Vol.1: detectivechan.blogspot.c\u2026)",

    "text": "We hired the top floor for a private work function and were absolutely stunned when we arrived - the decor is beautiful beyond anything we had imagined, and the attention to detail (from aged leather sofas and fireplace in the ante-room, from candles and a melting clock found in the main dining room, was very impressive. The staff were very accommodating of our individual needs, and were very friendly, even helping us pack up our giant Jenga to collect the next day! The area was completely private, with no hire charge - only a minimum spend. For our group of 24 the size of the room was perfect.The food, however, was not spectacular - it wasn't bad, but neither was it particularly memorable. This is based on the set menu for larger parties, rather than the a la carte within the main restaurant.That said, the venue itself (which generally raised oohs and aahs from our group) was so impressive that I would definitely return.",
