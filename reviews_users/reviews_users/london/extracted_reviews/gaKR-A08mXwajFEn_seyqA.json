    "text": "Leons are rapidly popping up all over the shop and that can only be a good thing. Where else can you get affordable free-range chicken, wholemeal rice and mayonnaise-free coleslaw to take out? The idea is that you can eat well and still get fast food, so the emphasis is on fresh, organic, local and nutritious and it tastes really good too. I'd reccomend the superfood salad and the sweet potato falafel wrap. Mmmmmm and to drink you don't get a better thirst beater than a lemon mint and ginger 'quencher'. The atmosphere is generally upbeat but somehow really cosy, although I went in on a Saturday and it was clear the staff were having trouble keeping up with the fast food pace - there were a load of cardboard boxes and cups stacked up and paper all over the floor. It's becoming a favourite with yummy mummies so there were plenty of babies in the (homely, wooden) highchairs, throwing salsa verde across the restaurant and rubbing chocolate brownies into the (homely, colourful) toys and books. So its best to go in during the week when the market and accompanying carnage isn't on. It's a shame the whole menu isn't organic and local, but maybe that's not compatible with the pretty reasonable prices. The only real down side is that i noticed when you ask for a smoothie or juice, they pour it for you ready-made out of a plastic cup and then chuck that cup away - seems a bit wasteful and not in keeping with the caring ethos they purport to hold dear. Generally though, yum yum yum.",

If you're fancying something a bit more substantial, they do great salads, soups, curries and even bacon baps. \u00a0I love the interior of Leon, comfy sofas, industrial lamps hanging off the pipes from the ceiling and bookshelves filled with books which brings a more homely feel to what could be just another souless chain restaurant.I still prefer the smaller, independent cafes but it's difficult not to pop into this one, for organic, healthy food it doesn't get much better than this.",

Even though it sounded like a great idea to me I was also aware of how hot new trends get hyped to death, so I didn't really bother going, until I stumbled across a branch in Spitalfields, while waiting for a mate that was late. It's a great Sunday timewaster's venue; brightly decorated in wake-me-up primary colours, sofas to sink into, a good spread of papers. A perfect springtime location. The food is fantastic. I went there a month ago and had their Leon Gobi - a fun spin on a lovely Indian dish. What's even better is he fact they share the recipes with you on their website so you can also make them at home. They have some awersome superfood salads, fresh juices, smoothies tea and coffee, although it's a real shame they use Sunrise soya milk which is vile and muddy-tasting. Switch to Alpro, people! Their service is nearly as fast as Pret-a-manger; which is handy if you're as hungry and impatient as I often am. If you want one of the good seats though, best get there before 1pm, which is when the hordes of shoppers descend upon Spitalfields to part with their hard earned dosh.",

Cheap as anything, which is unusual for the area and, unlike most Leons which are really take-away joints with a few seats thrown in for good measure, this is a proper large sit-down eatery. As with the other locations, Leons is all wholefood so if you're desparate for a huge steak with fries this isn't the place for you, but I really like it - their sweet potato falafel, brown rice and raw pea salad dish is lovely :) If there is one quirk, it's the menus - one sheet with food on one side and a selection of wine on the other. No mention at all of the other drinks that they have on offer, including their wonderful smoothies. A rather strange omission",

We both had salads, which contained ingredients like broccoli, alpha sprouts, pumpkin seeds - lots of vitamins basically. I always feel really proud of myself when I eat food like this at home, and even more so when I'm out. Oh and we had some really yummy falafel as well, I'm into Middle Eastern food at the moment so I guess that really won me over. We both agreed it is a girly place, though the metorsexual man will probably like it as well. The vibe is kind of funky, with unisex toilets and lots of quirky wall decorations. There was something that looked like a children's play area in the corner, but I didn't really invetsigate any further.... I suppose it would be \"yummy mummy\" heaven here, although, thankfully, I didn't notice too many of these types... Just people hanging out, chilling and chatting. There was nothing too try hard about it, which I liked.",

You are likely to get a table tennis ball in your food or eye. If it wasn't for the table tennis table and the way the food is served I'd give five stars. I think I'd love this place if they served the food on proper plates with proper cutlery.Very happy to see the table tennis table has gone and for this reason I ate here again and they now get an extra star., giving them four stars :-)People playing table tennis again so colleagues and I went somewhere else yesterday.

They also serve alcoholic beverage. \u00a0So some people also come for drinks.I would give this place a 3.5 but yelp doesn't allow that. \u00a0So I round it up to a 4 because this place doesn't deserve a 3. So I think you should give it a try. \u00a0Not an upscale restaurant but a pretty comfy place to go and hang out. :)",

I liked the fact that some smaller tables on the right had some guys sitting with loptops (now there's an idea).I was sitting with a very large group of people at one of the very long, very big tables (think canteen style) - ending up at the narrow end I got rather annoyed because people had to push through behind me to get to the seats against the counter/external glass wall. There was no space to push through between the long tables. Major gripe, squeeze em all in why don't you.The unisex use toilets were a very odd feature; extremely embarrassing until we realised it was a mixed toilet and we were in the right place after all.The other gripe was to do with my drinks order: all I wanted was a white wine spritzer (less alcohol, more nice bubbly water!) - I had to order those separately and getting handed over to another guy for pouring the wine (why?) I wasn't even sure if I was still being served. It felt like they had a lot of people standing around behind the counter but they didn't look as if they knew what they were doing there.The external mall-like environment wasn't much to my liking, it's too food court for me and I hate that.Overall: good atmosphere, might come back in a smaller group if I'm feeling patient and chilled.",

    "text": "I was on a hunt for a pastry hybrid. I awoke early this morning, psyched for my own discovery of this mythical and mystical culinary phenomenon.All I wanted was to find a Cronut. Maybe if I was incredibly lucky I would find a Townie. It was not to be - over-excitement combined with under-preparation was my own cross-breed of a disastrous day.I rocketed to Bank to be at Bea of Bloomsbury at 10 o'clock sharp. It opened at 12. Kicking myself, I then stomped further East - through Spitalfields, across Brick Lane.. The Townie had failed me so I was turning to the infamous Cronut. I suddenly became lost down a non-descript street where the shutters of a small inconspicuous shop were pulled down. Rinkoff Bakery was also shut. No Cronuts for me either.I was now extraordinarily hungry and slightly annoyed with my own stupidity.So there I was, back in Spitalfields, viciously compromising my pastry craving on a sticky table at Leon.The 'Padstow Box' (which included smoked salmon - in Cornwall?!) tasted very good despite the disappointment of having a cardboard box shoved at you. A pea and mint salad, with fresh lemon and smoked mackerel pate were well thought of and happily munched. Coffee was excellent. I understood that it was fast food with fast service, but the presentation on this morning did not seem to correspond with the fresh and attractive concept of the restaurant.",

Was nice!Came in to warm up before tackling the Old Spitalfields Market and had the intention of grabbing a tea however was far too tempted by the sound of raspberry lemonade so opted for that along with a brownie.The lemonade was very refreshing - the raspberries sweetened the tang of the lemon nicely. The brownie was a bit 'meh!', I mean, where were the nice chunks of chocolate? It wasn't anything to write home about.Anyway, my eyes had wandered to JB's Lemon Ginger Crunch so I haggled her to do a 50/50 split of our cakes and I think I won on that front - hers was better than mine! Noms!All in all Leon is a-ok, I didn't spy anything in there that has particularly inspired me to return, although if the weather is as chilly as that again and I'm in need of warming up I might pop in for a tea and a Lemon Ginger Crunch!",

However, I still prefer my kebab places.Regardless, Leon rocks up 4 stars because of customer service. The baked chips took a while. I didn't really noticed, but they came up with a brownie. And they must have remembered I originally said no to a brownie for dessert, because they asked if I'd like something else since I waited so long. Free flapjack bar and a brownie for a friend!",

The humous was not much to write home about it but it did the trick for me.Leon seems to fill that middle ground that not many other places touch.

Leon has a lot of this stuff mixed into their rather tasty food and at first, I have to confess, I was cynical. Why put some super-grain or rather pseudocereal into a meal that tastes perfectly fine without? However slowly but surely, I was lured in. With those pretty bright signs and their mix of salads, I learned to eat quinoa. I learned to chew and chew that pseudocereal until the cows came home. And come home they did. For meatballs, and grilled chicken, I endured the pain of over-chewing and now, I'm officially a fan of Leon, despite the above issue. They even have a book, which I had a look at and I have to say, I'm tempted. Not only did it publish recipes but also had nice colourful illustrations. And their founder now writes for the Guardian. So in sum, meatballs, lemonade and comfy sofas. Plus they serve excellent sausage baps in the mornings. Seriously. Get one. Get one now.",

This is one place i don't feel the need to have Coke :)My only complaint against them is with their quantity of servings. I feel its too little, never enough for a complete lunch (or is it that i eat too much and should be looking to cut down ? ). But hey, that doesn't mean that i won't be back.

    "text": "As the Leon branch opposite my office has served me well of late, when I was left in a breakfast lurch by a closed Wetherspoons' kitchen at Liverpool Street this weekend, I decided to head over to the Spitalfields branch for some munch. And well, I do like this Leon. I like how big it is. I like the way there's loads of different furniture, I like the retro styling and I big like the illuminated red LEON out front. But yeah, it's all front and it's what's going on in the kitchen that I'm interested in, really. I've been here before for one of the superfood salads. It was very good - feta, brocolli, some quinoa, health win. On Sunday though I went for their Breakfast of Champions - coffee and porridge. Not sure what it'll make me a champion of, but never mind. The boy went for a bacon batch. My main point of mild irritation, before we'd even started, was that the food took so long to be prepared. There were going on for as many staff members in the kitchen as there were at the counter ordering, but no sign of the fabled 'order out of chaos' I have come to expect from places with counters. I appreciate it was a Sunday morning, but it was dawdly and dull. And so after some messing around and lots of people getting served before us (que?), I was presented with a tub and the boy with a rather meagre looking silver bag. Inside he had a 'tasty but tiny' bacon roll on some sort of rye. Inside my pot was some porridge swimming in watery honey (assume watery cos it was hot), so I stirred it up and hoped for the best. Unfortunately there was far too much honey in there though - the damage had been done. It was far too sweet for me, though the porridge was decent quality and consistency and the honey was clearly very good. Overall, there's points to be had for the ambience, decent (if a little weak) coffee and tea and good quality ingredients, but points lost for poor execution without excuse. Yes, I'll try again, but to me Leon is treading a bit of a fine line here. One foot wrong and you'll lose me, boys!",

I had a chicken burger and some chips, for not much... Don't remember the price though, just how kind the waiter was. Well, it most definitely helps that he spoke French with me and is African too, but he was not obliged to be nice to me, was he?Good place if you're craving good quality food fast, and this one is in Spitafields so is a no brainer.

Photographs are forbidden. Obviously I was not pleased even though I told them that I was taking pictures to put on a Yelp review. Still wasn't allowed. For anyone who hasn't been to a Leon before, the place is quite quirky with random objects placed everywhere and from my memory (sorry I couldn't provide pictures) a shelf suspended above the till filled with colourful books. Anyways onto the food. I ordered a curry rice box which wasn't as flavoursome as I'd expected. It was ok but to someone after something abit more substantial for the price being charged, they're better off going to an actual Asian restaurant. Leon is only good if you're desperate and in need of a quick bite to eat.",

They use good quality meat in the meatball and kofte plates which is nice because ground lamb/beef can feel heavy and fatty, as well as really delicious chicken thigh in their chicken dishes.

They have a unique selection of food there and it's all aimed at people living on the healthy side of love that wasn't summer quick food. It just didn't exactly get me excited. I got some cross cut chips, which in the time it took me to walk outside were pretty luke cold. Though it's right by the market so good location if you want to sit down after a bit of a browse. Maybe I should try more of their food before I judge them to much.",

Yet what a glorious failure it has been! Leon is the easy, fast, healthy lunch place I've been waiting for. No more \u00a35 sandwiches that don't fill me up at Pret, I wander to nearby Leon (this one has plenty of seating) and savour a bit of hummus & flatbread, a superfood salad and a filter coffee and watch the people go about their day in busy Spitalfields. There's nothing like it. If I'm out from work early and need to be somewhere later in the evening, I often grab a bite here before setting off. Being a member of their club entitles you to 40% off food after 4pm. It's free to join so well worth it!",

Grilled meatballs, aioli chicken with either brown rice and slaw or salad which were very good.+ There is a good range of options but the menu is slightly confusing since there is a lot going on.+ Service was quick and friendly.What I don't like:- the high prices. We paid \u00a318 for two small lunch specials with a small lemonade and small \u00a0'baked fries' for fairly meagre portions. \u00a0A bit too steep I think.- If you just get the small sandwiches they never seem enough. Hey, guys need to eat when we are hungry!So 3 stars since the food was and the concept is great but value isn't that good. If they just upped the portion sizes and/or reduced the prices a bit that would easily move it into 4 star territory.",

But I'm not a fan of confused service.The food here is no different to other Leons I've been to: relatively healthy and original, but slightly pricey. I liked the large amount of seating outside in the market, which makes this Leon unusual. I didn't like the somewhat confused service this led to. I waited obediently at the 'wait here' sign, only to be ignored and to have to go to the bar, where I was told to wait at a table. I duly did, but it was sometime before my order was taken.So: food - reasonable. Seating in the covered expanse of Spitafields market - great. Service - forgetful. Overall - A-OK.",

I remember the old Spitelfields market as I used to pop over regularly when I lived in Dalston. It looks very different these days. Way more up market and way more price. Leon reflects that change. It looks great inside and out. All the cool elements are here, but for me just a bit too 'designed'. It lacks a creative, interesting vibe. The staff were Ok; a bit snooty to be honest. The food was fresh and tasty enough but it felt bland ... just healthier and more expensive that the average fast food. It arrived way too quick for something made fresh - freshly put into a box maybe. The wifi was good and the huge choice in chair and table styles was great, as was the outside seating area. But overall it felt like a great idea gone a bit stale, i.e. minus the passion that perhaps was originally brought to Leon.",
