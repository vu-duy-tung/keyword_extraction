It's surprisingly calm considering it's in tourist central. I've never found it too overwhelmed with out-of-towners. Always a bit of space available to tip a pint.The interior is cozily appointed: nice fixtures, plush rugs, dark wood. The only thing - and this kills me because I'm all for saving the environment - is the energy efficient bulbs make this place feel sterile and cold, like a hospital operating theater or interview room at police headquarters. Maybe they could invest in some lampshades?The staff was all right. Neither great nor bad. The selection of beer is the same. If you need a pint, you could do worse getting one here, but you'll hardly find some new and unexpected craft beer here.",

Why a place with such a great location would allow this person to work there is a shame. It was my wife and my final dinner in London after a wonderful 3 night stay. The convenience from our Westminster Bridge hotel was hard to ignore for this final British experience from Boston. This youngish, non-British female server (wish I had her name) took our order without a hint of a smile and gave only my wife her drink order - I order the same - but she delivered only one! Then reminding her of my order she put it in front of me with no apology whatsoever. She later collect the empty bottle of my wife with a reach across her face and again no apology! The different person who collect our tab at least asked how things were with a smile - Manager please fire the young female server working the evening of Weds April 12Go here for a beer but this place does not deserve customers wanting a meal",

The fish was tasty and flaky. the batter was crispy. Great flavor. Did not go wrong with this choice. Definitely go after the lunch rush and before the end of the work day. this place fills up fast and you will have to wait.",

The place is small (we sat upstairs). But overall, we had a great time there. It was my dad's first time in London, and he is a very picky person, but he loved St. Stephen's Tavern (especially the Peroni beers!) I would come here again!",

The host got very snotty with me and said there would be people going up and down the stair. I told him I would move if need be. Soon after that we got our table. Our table was very small for three people. Very uncomfortable. I asked for an ice tea, they do not have ice tea. I the saw lemon aid on the menu, I ordered it. Turns out it was 7-up. I asked for the special of the day....they were out. I also asked if we could move to a bigger table ( there was one right next to us) was told no we could not. She did finally let us more. There customer service is poor at best. The food was just ok. I had a chicken curry bowl. It was mostly rice, a little chicken and even less curry. We are in London for 2 more days and I will not be going back here.",

We wanted to try authentic fish and chips and our taxi driver recommended this place for the food and the location. We were seated in the second floor of the restaurant since the first floor consist more of the bar rather then tables. I ordered a pint of the house lager and then we all ordered the fish and chips without the green peas.We waited a while for the food to arrive, but the waiter was really cool and he started a really interesting conversation on all the cool things to do in London. When the plate finally arrived and it was large and the fish was brown and very crispy while the chips or how we American say french fries were also nice and crispy. Regarding the fish I got to be honest the taste was really bland I didn't really cared for the mayonnaise type of sauce on the side. For dessert we decided to order the chocolate pudding which was amazing, it gave us a sweet ending to our meal. The pudding in London is more like a moist pound cake with hot fudge pour on top rather than the pudding found in the states. We really did enjoy the exterior of the pub I felt that I was going to bump into Sherlock Holmes himself!",

    "text": "After trying to capture the perfect shot of that grand ol' clock tower at night, my fingers were practically frozen on Westminster Bridge. I somehow slowly managed to click my yelp app, and the closest restaurant that really stood out to me was St Stephen's Tavern.Just a block away from the bridge, this pub was easy to find, bustling with many patrons as was seen through the windows. My instant worry was that there wouldn't be space for us to actually sit down and eat. However, to my surprise, the upstairs tables had a few open spots left, and we were promptly given one.First impression: Blimey! Such small seats and tables!Oh well, I was already warming up to the place as my fingers slowly thawed.Although I saw on reviews that the place is visited by locals and tourists alike, it seemed like we were the only tourists there on that night. Maybe it was the way the waiters, with their particularly prosaic expressions, seemed to treat us with a slight annoyance.I ordered the fish and chips because why not just fully embrace that tourist life. Although I didn't have the opportunity to taste many other fish and chips during my trip, I honestly think this place has it down to a crisp. Get it? Anyway, the fish was delightfully tender on the inside as if I were eating an actual fish rather than some processed cod mash you find in the freezer section. The fried batter merely enhanced the texture of the cod rather than overwhelm the taste. The tartar sauce was also refreshing rather than overpowering. Also, there was just the right amount of chips and peas on the plate. Great grub indeed.Next time I come back to London, I'll definitely be thinking about a plate of fish and chips from this place again!",

    "text": "If you are looking for a quick meal, after a day of sightseeing like we were, St. Steven's is a pub with some decent food. Since St. Stephen's was located in the heart of Parliament Square, it was expected that there would be plenty of other tourists, but to our surprise there were plenty of locals in there.Even though the pub was pretty crowded, we received a table right away when we walked in around 5pm. We were probably the last lucky ones before a real wait began to build up. We took a seat in their bar area, which was pretty tight-fitting. The tables were one on top of the other. We received a menu from a waitress and proceeded to order asap at the bar. (Keep in mind, as with all pubs in London, order your food at the bar.)We ordered the hand battered Fish & Chips and Sausage & Mash.Fish & Chips (Hand Battered) - \u00a0The order consisted of a Tomato Ketchup Tanglefoot Ale Battered Cod, Tartare Sauce, Chips and Garden Peas. Since this was my 1st fish and chips in London, I thought it was pretty good. The cod was fried well, but quickly softened as I doused it with vinegar. I felt that the plate could have contained a bit more chips. As for the peas, there wasn't much transformation with it. It possibly could have been frozen peas that were just microwaved.Sausage & Mash The order consisted of 3 good size sausages sitting in a Stowford Press Cider & Red Onion Gravy. There was a small side of mash and the same peas from the Fish & Chips. The sausage was good, but nothing that knocked our socks off. Also, the mash was of a good soft texture and went well with the gravy.Crispy Battered Squid Rings, Sweet Chilli Sauce Pork & Herb Sausages, Stowford Press Cider & Red Onion Gravy & GardenBeing that this was our very 1st meal in London, we didn't have much to compare it against the day we went. The pub was lively, the food was good, but nothing about the food really blew us away. It satisfied us, but I couldn't say that the food here at this pub was something I had never tried before. It was a good average conveniently located \u00a0pub and worth coming to if you're in need of a pint or meal in the area.",

They are not helpful in anyway and treat everyone like an inconvenience and the beer selection is not what anyone would expect from a tavern in such a busy location, not good at all. Much better options all around the area.",

    "text": "Both tourist trap and local hangout, I think this place is always packed. It certainly has that old fashioned tavern feel, though, with barely any elbow room to spare. The tables are situated nicely, however, and it's cozy enough to enjoy a meal without feeling like a sardine.The food is your typical bar/ pub fare, with fish & chips, burgers of several different varieties, and small plates, with plenty of booze to go around. They also have a designated area outside the tavern where you can stand with your beer and have a chat with your mates, if you're into that sorrow thing. I ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken Burger with chicken goujons, mayo, lettuce, tomato, redo onion, chips, and sweet chili sauce. It wasn't anything to stand up and scream about, but it was good; though a bit pricey for what you get. The winning point of this restaurant is its proximity to all the local tourist attractions: the London Eye, Big Ben, literally across the street, Buckingham Palace about a 15 minute walk down the way, and the River Thame. Not a bad place to refuel for the rest of your journey, eh?",

The one thing that did annoy me was my servers comment \"I should've known\" after I placedd my fish and chips order; I suppose this was due to the prevailing abundance of American tourists there all wanting to experience UK style fish & chips. This actually gave me a sense of If you're in the area, pop in for fish in chips. It's a great place to break away from all the surrounding hustle & bustle.",

    "text": "When my wife and I decided to visit London for the first time, eating fish and chips at a local pub was one of the top items on my list. After countless Yelp reviews, I finally landed on St. Stephen's Tavern. Was it the most authentic fish & chips in London? Probably not. Just like eating at a Times Square Italian restaurant isn't the most authentic New York City cuisine, but given the reviews, the location compared to our list of attractions, and even the decor, I knew it was the perfect place to go.Knowing that the dinner rush would probably be maddening for such a small pub in a crowded part of the city, we actually decided to show up rather early at around 17:00 (that's 5:00pm for us Americans). We waited about 2 minutes (just enough time to peak at the traditional decor at the bar) and then were brought upstairs to a small table. We found it rather stuffy up there, but London isn't exactly known for its air conditioning (and why would it need it most of the year? We just happened to visit during some oddly hot 90-degree weather).Even though I already knew exactly what I wanted, I took a quick look at the menu. To be honest I really wanted to sample one of the local ales, but sadly I was actually sick during our trip, so I was staying away from alcohol (wah!). The selection did look terrific though. The waiter came around and I ordered the traditional fish and chips with peas. My wife was not in the mood for seafood and decided on the Caesar salad burger.About 20 minutes after we ordered, our food arrived. Holy cow was that fish massive! Still, I almost ate the entire thing it was so good! Crispy, juicy, and savory. I also really loved the chips and the peas were a terrific compliment to the dish. My wife also reported that she enjoyed the burger (I had a bite and enjoyed it as well).My one gripe? The service was just \"ok\". To be honest, we didn't have a great service experience anywhere in London, so this wasn't that big of a disappointment, but some added customer service would have been nice.So what's the verdict? If you're near Westminster and wanting some traditional fish & chips (in a touristy area but a not-so-touristy pub), this place definitely fits the bill. Just be warned there was a line out the door when we walked out (during the early dinner rush).",

    "text": "Very busy tavern as it is close to all the top attractions in London. Tables are small so I don't really recommend it if you have a large group. We ordered the fish and chips, the scampi and chips and potato skins. The fish and chips outshined all other items we ordered. It is a little overpriced \u00a314, but based on location it's what I expected. At least the portion size was generous. \u00a0It's a little weird that they seat you but you have to go order from the bar. The food was prompt and hot as you know it didn't linger under a heat lamp before it came to your table. For me the most interesting was seeing the food delivered to the severs via a dumb waiter as I watched them pull hot plates out of a little cabinet near the bar. If you want tavern style experience in London this the place I enjoyed. Service needs improvement as the workers didn't seem happy but overall it was Good experience for a last minute decision.",

    "text": "Despite being in a heavily tourist area, this spot had a welcoming smell of fish and chips for a snowy Friday evening. Not too bad of a wait for a table of two (10 minutes), as we looked through the menu.Although we got seated by a waitress, they told us to go order everything at the bar. Thankfully there was no one ahead of us, so ordered the Fish and Chips (\u00a314) and a pint of beer (\u00a35?). Beer came fairly fast, had a decent ale with moderate hop (noticed lots of beers in the area are middle-ground ABV). After 20 minutes our food order came out, however they gave my friend a salad instead of the burger he asked for. This took an additional 5 minutes for them to correct. As to the food itself, fish is breaded well without being overdone. Paired with the tarter sauce made for a delicious bite. Chips were thick cut and went well with some vinegar and mayo. Peas were an afterthought.Aside from a couple hiccups, service was fine. If you don't want to walk around then this is a fine enough option for a sit-down meal.",

We had fish n chips and a beer which were good, exactly what you'd expect from a tourist area. Service was good and we were seated immediately. Ordered the fries but it hardly had any meat, but they were still good probably wouldn't order them again. Other than that, nice place stop by if you're in the mood for some fish n chips lol.",

Walking in gives you the feeling that you can forget the real world problems and enjoy a pint until you walk out and recall the bustle of the city. A tip of the cap to the ownership for maintaining the nostalgia of the pub, and for those who have yet to experience, you'll enjoy it as I did for years to come. Friendly patrons, welcoming staff, reasonable prices and jolly atmosphere all make for a good time. Big Fan!",

This lovely traditional pub has a great and specific atmosphere which is impossible to explain.A good choice of drinks (including real ales) and a promising menu for their food are waiting.The barmaid was very friendly and tried to tempt us to eat something (in a nice way).(The special situation connected with the parliament opposite was already mentioned by earlier reviewers.)",

Surprisingly usually somewhere to sit, especially upstairs. Packed full of officials and Parliamentarians and they serve reasonably priced white wine in a cooler bucket. Good.",

    "text": "Great old pub with nice atmosphere, well run, good selection of drinks and menu - but arrive early as kitchen often shuts about 9pm when the regular crowd of officials dries up! Busy at lunchtimes and 5-7pm due to its location, but a fairly quick turnover of the regular crowd means you can get a seat before long. Always worth checking upstairs. And it's quiet at the weekend and late evening! Not the cheapest of venues but average for London pub prices - and it has to be the closest for tourists needing a break from the sights of Parliament.",
