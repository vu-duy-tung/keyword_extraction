I think this is more with NYC than with London, but these waiters were on the ball. They gave great advice, seated us right away, and went out of their way to get the door as we were leaving. For some reason I had the bug for Indian and both Memories of India and Woodlands did not disappoint.

The food was good but I've had better Indian food in Seattle. \u00a0The portions were a bit small but that's very typical of Indian restaurants so I'm not complaining. \u00a0The service was indeed extremely attentive (as noted by other yelpers), and almost too much so. \u00a0The waiter put the napkin in my husband's lap and picked up every crumb from the table immediately after we finished eating. \u00a0I feel like if the service is supposed to be so great, why do we have to buy water for 3.99? \u00a0The other part that I wasn't thrilled about was they kept trying to upsell us without making it clear what the prices were. \u00a0In America, many Indian restaurants bring you chappatti for free at the beginning of the meal. \u00a0Here they brought it at the beginning but then they charged for it. \u00a0They brought us two orders of rice without asking if we wanted them both. \u00a0The server tried to bring us mangos at the end of the meal. \u00a0When the check came, it \u00a0was so scribbled that it was hard to tell what we were paying for. \u00a0Was service charge included? \u00a0We couldn't tell and therefore tipped. \u00a0It felt like they were trying to get as much money out of us as possible while leaving us confused.There are several more indian restaurants in the same neighborhood and I will try a different one next time. Three stars for solid food though.",

We went during lunch hour, there was only 1 table at the restaurant so they were not busy by any means. The man that was supposed to be our server came over after we had been sitting down for a while. We gave him our drink orders, he left, and our drinks came out slowly. We then had to wait a bit longer for him to finally come back and take our order and once we told him what we wanted he basically snatched the menus out of our hands which was unprofessional to say the least. A little bit later a group walks in and they take a seat. They get their drinks and shortly after the server comes out with an appetizer, they have not ordered any food yet so my partner and I look at each other confused. At that moment we decided to walk away. The way we were treated left a bad taste in my mouth and unfortunately the only memories I will have of this place is of their unprofessional attitude.",

No one ever checked in after food served. Chicken was outright bad. Not cooked right. Bland. Paneer ok in the sense if being passable. Garlic naan was flavorless. Mango lassi mediocre. It's a tourist trap and not worth going to. Boo on them.",

    "text": "Three weeks in a row I ate at this restaurant with colleagues of mine, we work for an airline and stay in the area. The first week, the food was delicious and service was friendly enough. Received a 20% discount because we arrived before 6:30.Second week I ate with one colleague. Wait staff seemed mildly annoyed the whole time. Food delicious and received 20% discount for arriving before 6:30. Third time, which was last night, \u00a0the wait staff was so grumpy and unfriendly. Never smile at us, but that's ok, I can handle it, the food is delicious. Waiter brings check and says \" special airline discount \" -- 15%. Hmmmmm. I didn't realize until much later which prompted me to write this review. (Trying to decipher the bill is hard enough because the handwriting is barely legible.)So now we will not return. There are plenty of other places to eat in the area that can treat us a little nicer and appreciate our business. I can't imagine why working for an airline subjects you to less than the rest of your customers.",

I'll be back here for sure!",

The food was excellent with very distinguished and identifiable spices differentiating each dish. The peshwari naan was a nice surprise and was really good their take on chicken Tikka Masala was good although unbelievably mild per my daughters request the chicken murgh jalfrezi was appropriately spiced medium. Desert was a diverse offering of Indian to American with even some tiramisu thrown in for good measure.",

Memories of India has a unique way of presenting Indian classic dishes and experimenting with new twists. The sauces are so subtle and delicate they are unlike anything I've ever tasted. The service was very good. We arrived before the dinner rush on Sunday. Glad we came to Kensington and found Memories of India. Kudos to Imi for running a fabulous spot.",

My boyfriend flags down the waitstaff and angrily asks wtf we asked more than 4 times. The server nonchalantly tells us that one of the dishes contains my allergen, oh and they garnish the rice with it.... as if this should have been obvious.
