    "text": "The food is really great. I have that to say. The jap chae is almost exactly how I like it, not quite umami enough but pretty close; the bibimbap is good; other selected items have the right flavors and textures.But the service is below par. When I go to a restaurant I expect to have a single server plus a seating host and a busser. Here, I had to constantly attract the attention of whomever happened to be near me (I was sitting near the register) and had at least 5 people. And that's not including the ones who looked up and smiled but did nothing. Because of this, I felt largely ignored. It took waaaay too long to even bring me a glass of water.The decor, as everyone mentioned, is nice -- except the only place for single diners to sit is at the bar seating up against the window. And for some reason it is always cold, and the chairs are uncomfortable and heavy. I walked in and saw a number of empty six-seater tables and asked to have one (because I had eaten at the window before) and I knew it would be cold, yet they refused (I was also wet from the rain). I saw a number of couples sharing the communal six-seater tables and wondered why I couldn't have been seated at one. Oddly enough, this happened the last time when I went with a friend as well. Then I was completely forgotten about.This place could be really good if it gets its act together.",

I really liked the decor inside the restaurant, it gives it a really different feel to it which seperates itself from the other Korean restaurant in London.We enjoyed the food although I found the portions quite small but I expected that from the look of the restaurant. The bill for 4 people came to \u00a380 but we did order a fair bit more because of the smaller portions.This place is worth a visit and I would definately go back again.",

    "text": "I was one of the participants of the recent VIQ event at Kimchee. As anyone can tell from my user name, I am a huge fan of Korean cuisine. I had not made it to Kimchee yet and was really looking forward to my first visit as I had heard lots about it from other foodies.The first impressions were good if unusual for a Korean restaurant \u00a0the main restaurant has a Wagamama-style layout with an open kitchen and long bench-style seating. After a few minutes in the waiting area we were greeted by Adam, the restaurant manager, and led downstairs to the new dining area. The room had a much more intimate feel to it than the upstairs area, with smaller tables and lots of dark wood; very nice and stylish.After being introduced to Graham, who was our bartender for the evening, we were served a Korean plum wine with our first dish, Prawn Mari, which was a kind of summer roll but the spinach, and the sesame oil used to season it, was a very typical Korean combination. I've never seen such rolls on the menu of a Korean restaurant before so this was an interesting start to our taster menu. Next up was the Pa Jeon which tasted good but I must agree with chopstix2steaknives and would have preferred it to be a bit lighter. But nevertheless, the taste was good. It was served with Bek Seju, a Korean rice wine. I had never tried Bek Seju before as I usually stick to tea when I have Korean food. I must say that I found it to be a very acquired taste and smell but hey, at least I tried it.Other dishes, in no particular order, were Yang Yuem Chicken, Crab Tuigim, Gogi Mandu and Pa Jeon. This were served with Mak Geolli, which I found to be much more palatable than the Bek Seju!We were also served two very traditional Korean dishes, namely Yuk Hwae and Kimchee (also spelled Kimchi ;)The Yuk Hwae was very good and one of the better ones I have tasted but it would have been even more refreshing if the meat had been a bit colder. I also liked the challenge of mixing everything together as this is usually done by the waiting staff.The Kimchi is made from scratch and you could tell \u00a0it was not only very good and authentic; it was also heavily fermented, which is hard to find in restaurants as they usually serve a 'fresher' version of Kimchi. This was certainly the best Kimchi I've had in a restaurant.Our evening was rounded off by lovely cocktails and a we were given very handy guide to Korean restaurants in England which I will doubtlessly put to good use.Altogether I think that Kimchee is on to something good; some dishes are a fresh take on Korean food but it does not let down with the more traditional dishes. I would have loved to try a few more traditional dishes such as a Korean stew, Jap Chae or Bulgogi and hope that the opportunity will arise to visit Kimchee again. I was also impressed by the quality of the tableware, which is apparently imported from Korea. The staff are passionate about what they do and seem determined to introduce Korean food to as many people as possible. And the queues that form at the door of Kimchee every evening indicate that they are well on their way to doing just that.",

    "text": "So another guest of the VIQ event..the bar has been set high \u00a0this was exactly the kind of experience a VIQ event should be \u00a0sampling something new and exciting with generous and informative hosts.The venue is a great mix between the traditional and modern \u00a0they work hard here with the authentic touches and that is to be admired. The ground floor restaurant was busy and buzzing \u00a0we were downstairs in a private space about to be launched to the general public. Heavily styled with traditional touchescool and chic So Kimchee (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki\u2026) - a traditional fermented Korean dish made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings \u00a0made on the premises \u00a0still not really certain if this is pickled or fermented or both \u00a0their version was cabbage with chilli paste \u00a0I would say an acquired taste \u00a0not sure I could do a whole dish but as a component ingredient in other dishes it definitely adds a kick. (See photo below) The food was consistently of great quality \u00a0I think the fried dishes were the most successful - crab was very good and I know my kids would love the chicken dishes. This is a menu to savour and explore \u00a0my first experience of korean food \u00a0it won't be my last (See photo below) The real star of the show was the Yuk Hwae (above) - similar to a beef tartare \u00a0high quality raw beef with sweet pear and cucumber \u00a0served with sesame oil and seeds with an egg yolkcarnivore heaven.We explored the drinks menu in tandem with the food menu \u00a0I would pick the plum wines when I return \u00a0others a bit more of a challenge \u00a0need to train my palette to embrace the new.The real test is would I go backan easy yes \u00a0with friends or family.in a group with a pile of dishes to sample and share - perfect social fare. And a big thank you for the Korean restaurant guide \u00a0a really nice touch!",

    "text": "Kimchee is a new restaurant that opened up in Holborn. It took over the ex-Matsuri site that had a fire incident last year which it seems that they never managed to recover from.It was another ladies' catch up dinner and the opening of Kimchee was perfect timing. On the day we went, it was actually Opening Day 2.Even at 8pm, the place was jam packed and we waited for 40 minutes to get a table. While waiting, there was a gentleman who asked if he could join us. Sorry mister, ladies only and trying to cut the queue is a no no! When you get to the front of the queue, a lady kindly invited us to wait inside at a scenic garden patch of stone pebbles and fountain with a wall of Korean characters glowing against a dark setting. Turn your head and you are greeted by the grill section where you could see the chefs busily grilling away.We were finally called and upon being seated, we were informed that any skewers orders will take around 20 minutes due to how busy the kitchen was. We quickly placed our orders as most of us were starving by then. While waiting for our orders, we looked around and it was a huge place. I almost did not notice that there were 2 sections to the place that had a cage like wall dividing both sections. Most tables have seats of 6 with bar-like benches along the side for lone or double diners. I liked the decor with the lanterns motif used for the lights; the whole place had a streamlined unassuming posh feel to it.Kimchee -The crunchy texture and sweetness of the cabbage is more prominent in this version with the heat of the chilli hitting you only right at the end. Not overly spicy which is good for the non-kimchee lovers but bad if you like it super spiced!Sukju Namul - A cold dish of bean sprouts in sesame oil & garlic dressing. This was quite normal and a good one to order if you like bean sprouts.  Yuk Hwae \u00a3- One of my favourites in Korean cuisine. Yuk Hwae comprises of thinly sliced raw beef that is semi-frozen with pears that have been sliced to the same length and size as the beef to bring out the refreshing sweetness. Topped with sesame sauce and egg yolk to give an aromatic creamy balance. The Yuk Hwae was one of the better ones I've had in London. It is such an amazing summer dish when made right. The one from Kimchee was good, the sweetness of the pear slices paired well with the beef. The dressing was light with just the right amount of sesame to accentuate the flavours. The beef slices could have been set to a more semi-frozen state so that it gives that crunchy texture but this is just nitpicking here. I am already happy that I did not get one that has been drowned in sesame (so many places do that) such that you don't get all the other elements that make this so good.Jap Chae - I really like the Jap Chae in Asadal which is quite close by, actually that was our Plan B if we couldn't get in to Kimchee. We all loved the Jap Chae here. Sesame oil and soy sauce that has clinged to each and every strand of glass vermicelli noodles, delicious!Pa Jeon - There were 3 Korean pancakes on the menu but we decided to go for the traditional version which is made with spring onions and seafood mix, served with soy and chilli sauce on the side. The pancake was too doughy and it didn't have that slight crisp exterior. The flavours were drowned out by the too generous proportion of the doughy batter.Spicy calamari - Spicy calamari was quite ordinary. The calamari itself was good but the batter was not deep fried enough and was a tad bland. The vegetables that came with it were good though. Crab Tuigim - This was quite a disappointment. Deep fried soft shell crab should be crispy with the oil mixed into the juices of the crab and batter for that oh-so-good deep fried taste. Kimchee's version was not deep fried enough and the soft shell crab was still quite fresh because of that. None of us liked this one.Bulgogi - Bulgogi is another favourite that people like to order and we were no exception. Described as thinly sliced beef that has been marinated in a blend of fruits, soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, onions and garlic, this was GOOD! Tenderly soft and juicy.",

    "text": "I don't suppose this is the most authentic Korean place you can find in London, but it certainly is a lot better than a lot of the other noodle-y places in Central. I had the seafood noodle soup which came with a good amount and mixture of seafood and was nicely spicy as advertised. My dining companion had the bibimbap which was served in the sizzling pot with the raw egg on top. We both really enjoyed our dinners. We're definitely not Korean food experts, but the dishes were tasty, fresh and generous in size.The service was a little chaotic - the queuing system was manned by a girl who had no idea what she was doing and \u00a0lot of parties left because people that had clearly come in after them were seated beforehand. We were really only seated within 15 mins because we were quite assertive and flagged the fact that others were seated ahead of us.The seats are also packed very tightly togeather, so you really don't have much space to get comfy and it's certainly not somewhere to go to linger over drinks and dinner.Would be 4 stars if it was little more relaxed and the service less frenetic, but the food is good and it's a good price in for such a central location.",

Bargain.That said, the food was not absolutely outstanding as I've come to expect from other Korean establishments in London. \u00a0Part of this was my fault - I ordered basic bibimbap (rather than dolsat bibimbap) so it seemed distinctly cold. \u00a0My friend's pork bulgogi on the other hand was tender and tasty. \u00a0The starters were also great - although I do not recall the exact names at the moment, we had a beef spring roll, prawns with chili sauce and the best thing of all, the little omelet. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to hit Kimchee again (I would prefer Soju, Arirang or others) but in the neighborhood, it would be a relatively inexpensive and tasty option in a pleasant and buzzy atmosphere.",

My favorites were the fried dishes which consisted of; pa jeon (Korean style pancakes with seafood, crab tuigim (soft shell crab) and kanpoogi (chicken in a rice basket).At the end we received a guide to Korean restaurants in England, which I though was very nice, since they were trying to promote the countries cuisine, rather than think of others as competition.",

    "text": "This restaurant constantly offers deals and vouchers on their website. A couple months ago, I visited the restaurant using 'Lazy Sundays' voucher in which I got \u00a050% 0ff Food (excluding drinks) on Sunday. So if you'd like to visit this place yourself, it's best to watch out for new deals on their website. Despite some bad reviews, this restaurant seems to be very popular. I was there just a few minutes after it opened for lunch. There was a line of \u00a0customers queuing! and the place was already full! I thought it's because of the promotion but my friend who visited this place before has told me after ward that this place's known for a long queue. Therefore, not the best place for a large group. You would get a table quickly if it's a group of two or three people. They only take a reservation for 10 or more people. I have to say that they've got one thing right which is the decoration and ambiance. The place is spacious and looks very modern-Asian. The tables and chairs were quite big, so you get a plenty of space without having to sit uncomfortable close with other customers. The menu looked impressive and there're a lot of cocktails as well.The food's presentation was good. It wasn't messy and some efforts have been put into the dish. However, Pa Jeon was a bit cold \u00a0and some dishes didn't come with rice. I had 'seafood and soft tofu Jigae' and ordered rice separately. The soup was spicy and peppery. It's served hot and it was full of flavour. However, the seafood was quite small in there. I tried soju cocktails. I personally found it tasted a bit like a cold medicine. It didn't have a good balance like what a good drink should have. Overall, it would be best to visit during weekday and not with a large group.",

    "text": "Kimchee restaurant on High Holborn. Before getting into the details, I will give you the bottom line: worth a try because the Korean flavours are authentic and good, but expect to pay prices that are too high and service to be BAD. Food: I'm not Korean, but my very first job was working in a Korean restaurant, so I know a thing or two about Korean food. The flavours are spot on--i tried the bibimbap (mix rice dish), BBQ bulgogi, kimchee and the iced plum tea. The rice was just okay, but the rest was tasty! Price: for a limited time, Kimchee is offering 50% off the food (not drinks)l. If these were the normal prices, it would be so worth coming here on a regular basis BUT, it's not. \u00a38 for a small portion of BBQ (without rice or other traditional accompliments) is NOT really worth it. Kimchee, their namesake, is \u00a33 on the regular menu! (Most Korean restaurants give this away for free because it is so inexpensive, and is akin to ketchup; something that is on every Korean table.) Service: where do I start? The hostess we first encountered spoke very poorly, so I misunderstood her and inadvertently cut the line. Instead of coming over to clarify herself, she started yelling at me saying--\"you're very rude. You're very rude to cut in front of everyone.\" I stared at her and asked if she was being serious; she was. When I asked to speak to her manager, she started pleading \"no, no, no!\". This is the face of your new, expensive restaurant? Really? Time to reconsider! The waitress was nice, but also inefficient as we never saw her again after placing our initial order. In summary, worth a try while they are taking half off the food, but once that's over, not sure i will come back!",

Everything was deliciously prepared & really tasty. Unlike T, the steak tartare was most likely my favourite dish:) To top it up, we got the luxury of having the General Manager detailing every dish one by one with an explanation on origins and preparation.The four stars for now only reflects the fact that I didn't actually come to dinner at this place yet properly. That is not to say this will not change as I already have it on my radar for my next girlfriends night out monthly reunion and will update this review accordingly soon.",

    "text": "I happened upon this place while walking around on a Sunday evening. Not being from London, I didn't realize that many places to eat would be closed, but I was lucky enough to find Kimchee. It was pretty packed! So I was definitely excited and decided to try it out.I was seated very quickly and given a menu, and ordered a Bibimbap with raw beef and a coke pretty quickly without much issue, which came out surprisingly quickly. So far, so good! It was served in a hot stone bowl and the side of sweet chili definitely gave it a tasty touch. Overall, I liked it! But... I have a few concerns with the service. As a important side note, I did dine alone, as I was traveling by myself.There might have a been a slight confusion as to who my server was... I remember being halfway through my meal when a party of two next to me was seated. They ordered, ate, and paid, AND left all in a timely manner. I was sitting there one my phone with an obviously empty bowl and coke cup/bottle for forever! What other visual cues do you need to realize that a customer is done...? Thus, they came in midway of my meal, and was able to leave well before I did... By the time I left, I realized that I had been there for an hour and a half - with half of that time being on my phone and trying to flag time someone to get me my check and my change... Watching other groups of patrons getting serviced and leaving without issue didn't make me a happy customer... At least the food was good.",

    "text": "Well, you've got the place for authentic korean food here hence, the reason for the peak in prices. I wouldn't say it's too pricey, but for the portion provided I would say it's abit overpriced but hell yes I'd definately come back.I must say, I had a lovely dinner here with my friends. The must-order dish is \"bibimbap\" (you know what they say if you haven't ordered this, you're not dining korean food). The dish consists of rice in the middle topped with raw egg and you have variety of raw veggies around the dish. For chicken lovers who loves to spice things up a little, \"yang yeum chicken\" is the one! the chicken is lightly battered and served with sweet chilli sauce and it tastes heavenly. the outer layer of chicken being slightly cripsy but as you break through you get the very smooth texture inside ! For kimchi lovers, here at Kimchee they provide good quality kimchi ! note here, it's quite spicy so you might wanna order only a plate first and try out. the other dish I had was \"jap chae\" where it's glass noodles stir fried with meat and veggies. I reallyyy like this dish as the texture of the glass noodles are very gluey and you get just the right amount of saltiness from all the combinations. Finally.. Desserts! I have to say...I'M IN LOVE with the ICECREAM here. they provide a variety of ice cream options. I ordered the black sesame icecream and red bean icecream and was hooked with the flavours! It's not too milky but and you get the taste of sesame coming through and for the red bean icecream, you can taste the subtle red bean through the icecream. Overall, great place to dine! Nice, big and clean place to dine in but it gets crowded very easily and the tables are too close together in my opinion. You're presented with a variety of authentic korean dishes on the menu you'd be twined up not knowing what to order! but that's the experience I'm always looking for. The feeling of so many food options...whats not to love. ;) \u00a0 ps. The seats fill up really fast during lunch and dinner times so you'd wanna hurry there before those peak times or just make a booking with them to ensure you've got your place.",

My favourite was the jajang myeon with pork and seafood. I ordered the pork belly with a side of broccoli and was happy with the thin slices and tasty dip, but you need to order rice or a side dish.

But when I'm paying full price, it starts to hurt when the servers take ages to get to you, forget things and generally lose you in the hustle and bustle. I very clearly stated (and the waitress repeated back to me) no egg in my bibimbap - so when it arrived with egg, I sent it back, explaining to her that I was allergic. To my surprise and horror they brought it straight back and it was apparent that they'd just taken the egg out of my food and handed it back to me (!!). That is NOT acceptable, I don't care how good the food tastes. They refused to make eye contact with me again after that and I had to actually get up and bring the plate over to the chefs, who kindly remade it for me.So, final verdict: I would only go here with the discount. It's not worth the full price.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what happened, but this place has gone waaay downhill since it's opened.Let's start with the food - BLAND and frankly some dishes are tasteless. I'll give them credit for the raw beef tartare which is good - mix in the raw egg it's actually quite a tasty dish. Then you have the 'dolsot bibimbap' which doesn't taste of much. It doesn't matter which you get - chicken, raw beef, beef - tastes the same. In fact I've started ordering tofu bibimbap because I like the sweet teriyaki sauce that they drizzle (at least it brings some flavour?). Word of caution, the raw beef overcook easily because the pieces are so thinly sliced - you're better of having them cook it for you or risk having cremated/dry beef to go with your rice. The chicken/vegetable dumplings again are bland and the filling is mushy. Bleugh. Aren't these supposed to be freshly pan fried given the 10-15 minute wait time for food? My food arrived cold. The tofu is fine - you have a slightly chewy batter that is fried, and then teriyaki-esque sauce is drizzled over. Wouldn't order it again as an 'appetiser' if I didn't have the 50% discount. My friends have had the pancakes before - not very appetising in my opinion.Service. So we were in a rush, and I ordered dolsot bibimbap (I know it always comes quickly), and my friend ordered a selection of raw beef tartare, COLD noodles, pancakes. The server then tells us that the bibimbap will only take 15 minutes, while my friend's food will take 30-40 minutes and that she should consider ordering something else. We looked at him a bit surprised - cold noodles and beef tartare take 30-40 minutes, whereas a bibimbap only takes 15? We asked him how long the noodles would take thinking it was the pancakes that was the hold-up. Surprise, the noodles were the hold-up. She ended up ordering some soup dish instead but can someone explain to me how cold noodles with slices of cucumber, carrots and a sauce takes 30-40 minutes to prepare?! Food arrives, and they got her order wrong - kimchee pancakes turned into some chive/seafood pancake looking thing. Sent it back. We finish eating, and then it takes 10 minutes to finally make eye contact with someone (a very difficult task at this place). After asking for the bill, it took another 15 minutes to actually get the bill. Add on another 15 minutes for them to get the card machine and by this point I was beyond fed up. No extra tip for them, we got up and left. Highly doubtful that I'll ever come back. Maybe I'll consider it if I have the 50% discount voucher, but I'm not sure if I can put up with the service and borderline bad food. Yelpers, just don't come here. Tottenham Court Road nearby has much better Korean food.",

Like some previous reviewer said, all the dishes are overly sweet, perhaps to suit Londoners' tastes, but it's far from being authentic.

So when Kimchee opened a few months back I was there to test my taste buds its opening month. The verdict then: Food was okay and service needed improvement but I wrote off my mediocre experience to opening month jitters. I returned 3 more times since then and I'm happy to report that the service has improved. I speak Korean fluently so appreciated the greeting efforts by non-Korean staff at the door. The staff are always friendly and I've seen them offer suggestions to customers new to Korean cuisine. That's worth a star.If you're not new to Korean food, then I would recommend trying the ggak du gi (radish) and shee geum chi (spinach) side dishes. I also really liked their kim chee jjigae (stew with tofu, onions, scallions, kimchee, and choice of pork or seafood) - it's \u00a0just the right combination of filling, spicy, and refreshing.The reason why this place is only 3 stars is because1) In korean restaurants in NYC and California, you are always provided with an endless supply and choice of side dishes, especially the staple kimchee. Here, they charge for each side dish.2) You also have to pay for rice, but I've seen Thai places charge for rice alongside curry dishes as well so it may be a London thing.3) The portions are small.This isn't the best Korean restaurant I've ever been to, but combined with the clean decor, friendly staff, and picking the right entree - I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "I love being introduced to new places, and being taken to Kimchee on a VIQ event felt extra special. The manager made everyone feel very welcome and personally introduced a taster menu of smaller tapas-style dishes. I can truthfully say that I probably wouldn't have chosen a single one of those and therefore missed out on the great variety of textures and flavours typical of the cuisine. Each course was accompanied by a speciality drink \u00a0again, I would have probably just stuck to the more familiar choice of beer or wine. Some of the flavours probably take some getting used to, but I particularly like the fact that Korean spirits are a lot less strong than those usually used in cocktails. And apparently, some of the ingredients have proven health benefits \u00a0certainly true for the fresh fruit based ones.We were seated in the beautiful downstairs bar area which has not yet opened to the public, thus missing out on some of the hustle and bustle upstairs. I look forward to coming back and joining one of the mixed tables \u00a0even to queueing (average 15 minuts) and making friends with fellow diners along the way.There are obvious similarities to other successful Asian restaurants like Wagamama or BusabaEthai, but Kimchee has a slightly more upmarket feel to it, even though the prices are in a similar range. This is probably due to the great care the owner takes in choosing the crockery and decor for Kimchee. Wherever possible, this is sourced in Korea. We all fell in love with the beautiful Sake glasses (from Japan), and I particularly loved the clay dishes our food was served in \u00a0some of the dishes have their own signature plate!As I have never been to Korea before, I can't tell how authentic tonight's experience has been, but with a third of all diners originating from the country, this must be pretty close. The country's Olympic team has already booked their table!We learned a lot about the various foods, and I can't wait to return to sample one of the crispy rice or one-pot mains.I was surprised to find more than one parallel to German food: both love pickled/fermented cabbage (Kimchee is the name of the Korean version of Sauerkraut which is the base of many of the dishes), and steak tartare. The latter is a very brave choice to put on a menu and speaks for the high quality and freshness of the ingredients (in my case judged on appearance alone, I am still too much of a not fully reformed vegetarian).",

The food is OK but get ready for a lolwut situation if you're expecting something like LA K-town. The pajeon is wilted and lackluster, the kimchee is not complimentary (neither is the rice LOLWUT) and don't even think about banchan. However, the mains are all fine and you can also get tempura if you desire (haha ok suuure).The service is pretty bad so get ready to be heavily involved in flagging down wait staff and to actively campaign to get your water refilled. However, I did see Cha Du-Ri while eating here one time so it can't be all that awful right? RIGHT?",

Also they bring out everything at different times, luckily mine was first so no one got hurt.It's really nice looking restaurant with awesome features like a built in compartment under the seats for keeping your bags - great for people like me who are paranoid about having their stuff snatched!Food was generally quite good I thought, I'd agree with other reviewers that the bibimbap wasn't the best but the bulgalbi was delicious, it's always a favourite of mine. The Kimchee Jeon panckae was quite nice, a good option for vegetarians.I was really disappointed they didn't have the Yuk Hwae (raw beef) because it sounded yum and I wanted to try it. I ended up going for soft shell crab fried in breadcrumbs which wasn't great - just a bit stodgy.For dessert we had the Chap Ssal Ddeok which is a weird spongy rice cake. It was DELICIOUS. Like eating a really delicious slug.If you haven't tried Korean before and want somewhere easy to get to this (or Tohbang which isn't far) is a good enough place to start. Otherwise, head to New Malden!",

They recently did a huge renovation and added a bar in the basement. Keep in mind that they had an office and just bathrooms downstairs. Sometimes there is a long line at Kimchee because this is the poppin spot! The renovation was overall a great idea because people can now hang out and lounge downstairs at the bar while they wait. Since London is known for its bipolar weather, people won't have to wait in the rain ( ;Customers can also meet new people at the bar, which is a plus for everybody. As for the food, it is deeelicious.I always order the \"Seafood Dol Sot Bibimbap\", which is one of their unique dishes at Kimchee. It consists of all different kinds of seafoods and the best part is the nooroongji a.k.a (rice that turns a little hard like a chip that you eat at the end). Another dish that I order when I go here is the Galbi without the bones. The meat is soft and the Korean touch to it is made to perfection. Drooling as I am thinking of this dish at the moment. I also recommend Makgeolli. This is a drink made from rice and is my personal favorite. It is kind of like rice wine and tastes amazing. If you like carbonated drinks, add sprite to Makgeolli and it is bombtastic! But be careful not to drink too much because this will get you a crazy hangover just like wine. If you live in London and want to try authentic Korean food, this is the place to go! Trust me, I'm Korean ( :",

Maybe I should give it another try, however, in other Korean restaurants I fell in love with bibimbap on the first try. Otherwise--The prices were surprisingly low, service very nice.",

Because the environment of the restaurant was very nicely done and they definitely spent a lot on the decor. It was quite packed even though it was in the middle of the week. The receptionist got us a table in no time, but we had to share with another 2 ladies. The food and price were not bad at all, it wasn't expensive. It would be nice if one wants to eat decent Korean food in a nice environment without spending fortune (well, you can spend a fortune if you like, of course depends on how and what you order...). The down side of this restaurant was, the catchphrase of the waiters were \"Wait a minute, I'll be back!\" But then, 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins, no one was back... It was a bit annoying... And it would be better if going as a group of 4 at least to occupy the whole table, otherwise one would have to share the benches, which was very difficult to get into when someone else was already there, and had to sit very closely to each other...",

Your meal is filled with many different taste and I really enjoyed exploring all the dishes that we ordered rather without knowing what we did.

Service was very nice and caring, and they were short on staff so they had half the tables closed - a good decision as they prioritised good service over filling the room.Desserts were delicious and cocoa rice cakes particularly recommended... next time I will have a box of those to go!At \u00a318 per person excluding drinks it is quite a good deal for the area and quality.",

    "text": "I am the first to admit that whilst I love Asian food, I know very little about it. I feel extremely privileged therefore to have been invited to the VIQ event at Kimchee for a crash course in Korean food. This restaurant is one of a kind, currently an ambassador, that has not yet made it to chain-hood. I cannot emphasise the passion that the staff of Kimchee have for this variety of cuisine, their attention to detail, their desire to make this cuisine accessible for all, and just how much they know about their menu. I came away with a greater appreciation of the smells and tastes from this region and whilst I can understand that for many this may be an acquired taste, I personally developed a thirst for more. Being one of very few Korean restaurants in London, this restaurant, which is close to Holborn tube (so accessible from the centre), concentrates solely on this cuisine. They even go so far as (those who are sensitive to their carbon footprint skip to the next paragraph) sourcing the majority of their ingredients and table ware from Korea to ensure as authentic a taste and experience as possible. With a third of its guests claiming to be Korean, you cannot but help feel they have achieved their goal. This restaurant had actually been recommended to me previously, but upon arriving I found a queue formed outside so went for another option. I regret not having listened to this recommendation. Known for it's queues, this restaurant does not offer a reservation service (although this was mentioned as something they will be looking into for larger parties). The ethos being to make this restaurant accessible to everyone, and not just those that book in advance. Although it was mentioned that the Korean Olympic team has secured a spot. First impressions were extremely positive, low hung geometric lights create a warm ambient atmosphere and the high grade d\u00e9cor provide a feeling of elegance and sophistication. I was extremely impressed with the water feature and Zen like rock garden waiting area at the entrance, it created a peaceful place to wait whilst our tables were being prepared. This restaurant offers a communal dining experience, so you will be seated where they can fit you in (Wagamama style) although there are looking to open a new area for larger groups downstairs. Being a communal restaurant you are also encouraged to share smaller plates, however the menu features larger mains with the expectation that you will order a main and share a few smaller dishes. So that brings me on to the most stimulating part of the Kimchee experience, the amazing food and drink selection. On our visit we were greeted by a table furnished with high grade dinning ware which gave the dishes we sampled an air of culinary chic. Throughout the evening we were provided with a selection of smaller dishes including: Yang Yeum Chicken, spicy pieces of bread crumbed chickenYuk Hwae, a Asian version of what in the west we would call steak tartare. High grade steak with sesame seeds, pear and cucumber and a raw egg yolkCrab Tuigim, crispy fried soft shell crabGogi mandu, which are like dumplings or GyozaPa Jeon, a type of omelette pancake with seafoodKimchee, which, if you are astute you'll realise is the name of the restaurant, which is a dish of cabbage, layered with spices and left to ferment I would have to say that it is hard to pick a favourite from these as each was delightful, each garnished with fresh herbs, where crisp, never oily and each presented perfectly. However, a highlight of the experience was trying Kimchee, something which I have never heard of before. This is slightly fizzy on the tongue and reminded me of globki, a polish dish, with cabbage and spicy mince, however obviously without the meat. Apparently this dish, used as an ingredient in much of the menu, contains elements that aid digestion and the fair skin of older Korean women has been attributed to its unique properties. I didn't notice a change in my complexion, but as this was delightful, I wouldn't mind eating this on a more regular basis, regardless. I also enjoyed the Yuk Hwae, which I was assured is the most popular dish of the western visitors to this restaurant. The meat was succulent and the taste sophisticated and which would be very appealing to a number of my red blooded friends. The drinks included (if that is I recall them correctly), Mae Wha Soo, a sweet plum wine, Makgeolli a rice based fermented drink that smelt like Banana's and had somewhat of a taste of unripe banana, and Soju, which is a clear vodka like spirit that is weaker in strength and sweeter in taste. We also sampled a number of cocktails, which were lovely, but rather sweet for my tastes. My highlight would be the plum wine, which I have tried previously and remains a firm favourite. Having persuaded the menu, I was also pleasantly surprised by the price, it is very reasonable, especially when you take into account the quality of the food and surroundings. I had a",

If it's your first time eating Korean, make sure you go with someone who know how to eat Korean BBQ (yes, there is a specific way), or order something from this list and you can't go wrong (unless you're allergic):1. scallions and seafood pancakes (pa-jeon) 2. Kimchee pancakes (kimchee-jeon) 3. fried tofu with kimchee and pork (doo boo kimchee) 4. spicy rice cakes (ttuk bok gi) 5. soft tofu stew/soup (soon doo boo jji gae) 6. Korean BBQ beef (galbi) 7. Korean spicy pork BBQ (pork galbi) 8. beef stone pot rice (dol sot bibimbap) 9. glass noodles (jap chae). The icecreams are really good, too! (red bean, green tea, chestnut, black sesame and almond).",

The portion size is pretty small for the price, but the setting is chic and staff are friendly enough. The food comes quickly and in batches - whenever they are cooked, they are delivered.",

    "text": "Kimchee, you are at the bottom of my list for many reasons.1. The host taking names at the door is rather incompetent and seats other parties before yours. You must remind her/him that you have been waiting longer and only then will you be next in line to be seated.2. Your service stinks. Placing any order requires serious arm flailing to catch the attention of your too few staff. Paying the bill takes a good fifteen minutes. It is only when you physically get up, put on your coats, and start walking to the door does your server bring the bill. 3. The food is passable Korean but not authentic. The servers can not properly pronounce the food names and corrects you when you say them correctly.4. You are seated at communal tables (which I have greatly enjoyed elsewhere) that are overpacked. Even the servers must turn to the side and suck it in to clear the walkways. Why would I go back when I can go to Naru or Tohbang, both a 10 minute walk from Kimchee?",

It is located in the centre of the city and very approachable by subway. The restaurant had a very spacious place, very well decorated, modern and well-designed furniture, and above all, frequented by young and well-dressed people.The service was quite below average, IMO. The \u00a0waitress seemed to forget a lot and we have to wait a considerable time before they noticed us and ask to make the order.The food was delicious though. The kimchee was quite tasty and the dolsot bibimbap was delicious and fulfilling. But the best food we tried on this restaurant were the desserts. Although they were not \"traditionally\" Korean, it was something I've never tasted before. I highly recommend the green tea jelly with Matang.",

This is my new restaurant crush- so it has to be here!I've been to their fast food little sister Kimchee-To-Go a billion times and thought it was finally time to try the official restaurant. I suggested it for a family get together and we were all made believers. I quickly decided to have my birthday dinner here.Pluses: +The decor is modern and chic with a feel of Asian screens and Korean ceramics on display which is right next to:+The open kitchen. I have to restrain myself not to shove a fancy lettuce leaf in my mouth as I walk by.+Good for groups with long tables+FOOD FOOD FOODA huge selection for all sorts of eaters. The vegan selection is pretty impressive. Buckwheat noodle salad, vegetable dumplings, soups, bibimbap, and my current fav: Stir fried Udon. (I tend to not get stir fried udon because I could easily make it at home. After trying someone else's, I promptly made sure I had a whole portion to myself the next time. And I did.) Meat & seafood dishes were also given a thumbs up by the crowd.+Vegetarian dishes are clearly marked.+Cocktails. Quite an array of interesting-in-a-good-way drinks including traditional (dairy free) rice milk alcohol. I love the Kimberry (raspberry liqueur, rice milk brew, raspberries and mint).+Prices. Pretty decent! Mains are under \u00a39.+Toilets! I go as many times as possible because they are that nice. I also like to admire the waiting-area lounge downstairs.Minuses:-No reservations. Make sure most of your group comes together (silver lining: you can wait at the cool bar downstairs for a table)-Group tables can only fit 8 people, separating a larger group a bit. I'm not sure if the tables can be pushed together (especially if it's busy).-No vegetarian kimchi (but they do have namuls)-I want/attempt to eat everything.Bonus points:Friends are super impressed and thus impressed with you.See you soon, Kimchee!",

Once she arrived the waiters ignored us for a few minutes before seating us but barely speaking to us. We went for the beef bibimbap and chicken udon noodles. Luckily we were sharing both as the bibimbap came out straight away and the chicken noodles 10 minutes later. The bibimbap was average - beef ok but sauce not all that flavoursome and the veg in there wasn't as good as other places I have tried. I would not recommend this. However the fried chicken udons was DELICIOUS. Lovely thick noodles in a peanut sauce which onions, peppers and fried breadcrumbed chicken. Recommend this. I will be back to try another few things on the menu as the food was reasonably priced and the restaurant it big, spacious with a nice decor. Shame about service and the bibimbap.",

The toilets were be-autiful with nice smelling soap. \u00a0* It has mouth-watering meat broiling next to a glass window at the front to get your appetite up. Yum.* The food is pretty good. It seems like an Alan Yau-type of establishment (like Busaba, Wagamama, Cha cha moon etc.) so it's not too pricey, but well presented, decent grub. If the service was better, it'd be a solid 3 or 4 stars.But this is all let down by the service!* We had to wait in the line outside for about 20 minutes, then another 15 minutes inside. This isn't such a biggie...I'm getting used to it in London now BUT as they had given us the menu while we waited, we were all ready to order by the time we sat down. However the waitress wandered off never to be seen again! It took at least 10 minutes before we could flag someone down to let us order! - Eep 1.* The staff didn't really know how much we should order for starters. We were planning to share several things, but our waiter didn't know if they'd be easy to split...he didn't really know anything when we questioned him about our order. It made us wonder if he'd ever actually eaten the food here - Eep 2.* They took an incredibly long time to bring drinks. When they finally arrived, they brought me the wrong wine, and took even longer to bring my friend's beer. We had to ask twice before the beer arrived. Eep 3.* We asked for tap water when we ordered when we first sat down. They didn't bring it until we had almost finished. Eep 4. * They didn't bring plates, so it was hard to share the starters. Wtf - Eep 5.* They didn't bring spoons for the soup(!) I really don't know how they expected me to eat soup from a hot pot with chopsticks! Eep 6.* They added an extra service charge to our bill despite their terrible service. Oh! And then the waiter took a really long time to bring back our change...maybe he was hoping we'd just leave without it so he'd gain an extra tip!? Ah well.",

Galbi woogujee stew was solid. \u00a0Initially, we ordered yukhui as well (raw meat sushi), but it came out way too salty, so we ended up canceling it. \u00a0Finally, there was no side dishes usually served at Korean restaurants which I felt was a bit of a cheat.All in all, a safe choice to go for a sit-in Korean food, but I do feel like there could be better ones out there in London.",

When I went to kimchee for the first time I had seafood pancake and bibimbap. It was alright, not great. It does not feel authentic. Feels much more commercialized and manufactured. The second time was much more disappointing when I found out a simple kimchee soup would cost \u00a39 with \u00a32 extra if served with rice. Is this a joke?! Having lived in the States for many years, korean bbq and soups have been my favorite because of the high quality and affordable price ~ $10 for a big meal. It is very upsetting to pay a lot of money for not so great food just because of the convenient location and stylish design.",

Think Hakkasan and a more refined Ping Pong (Great Marlborough Street) and you kind of know what to expect.But also food-wise the restaurant ticked my boxes: the presentation was beautiful and the flavours were spot-on. Especially the barbecued beef was a tasty revelation (despite the texture being a little too chewy). Another standout is the staffing: my dining companion remarked that she felt like in an international hostel where people from all over the world worked: you were led to the table by Miss Poland, served drinks by Mr Korea; your orders were taken by Mme French and the bill was presented by Mr Turkish...While I really enjoyed this international flair, I think - like in the real world - they have not really learned how to play well together, nor are they aces when it comes to hospitality. After all, just because you have a fancy ear-piece and a walky-talky doesn't mean you're very well-organised!Yet, like I said in the beginning, I was really quite impressed and can definitely recommend you to pay a visit to this establishment!

Although the reviews from Kimchee on Yelp are pitiful, I figured I'd head in and come to my own conclusion...If you're looking for traditional Korean food, go somewhere is. If you're looking for Korean-inspired food, come here. It's not bad at all, but I felt some of the flavors were a bit off. We ordered the Beef bibimbap along with an order of bulgalbi. The bibimbap was pretty good, but I was a bit disappointed with the bulgalbi. It just lacked flavor... & the best thing about ordered galbi in a traditional Korean setting is the marinated flavor on it. My happy ending to this lunch was the black sesame ice cream. It is amazing!Great atmosphere here and a decent lunch spot. I'd honestly come back to try a few more things on the menu. Service wasn't particularly bad or good, but the food comes out rather quickly so that's always a good thing.",

Each time I have been with friends they are impress with the restaurant and the fact it doesn't require reservation, that's a thumbs up. However it can mean super long waiting times. Tried most dishes, everything was good, however there were some noodle dishes which were a let down. I also generally like it extra spicy in my pork dishes, but wasn't so. Their main dishes were great though, packed with flavour, served up well with nice fluffly rice. Yum. The service is a hit and miss. Can be really attentive and then very hard to get a hold of. I love Korean food and the small authentic restaurants whether they are in new Malden or central London are really great, cozy and homey food with a Korean romance drama feel all the time. Kimchee gives a more fancy family friendly vibe, and not so tense atmosphere which sometimes I prefer.",

There are a few places in central London, including this one , which feels like it's competing with the likes of Wasabi and Itsu. However, I'd say the food, while not perfect, is infinitely preferable to the vat cooking at the former, and the general insipidity of the latter. Expect to pay about \u00a39 for a drink, a side ( ie kimchee), and a main ( the Korean fried chicken is nice, but not stellar) to eat in.",

I'm totally impressed. \u00a0There's so many things you can say about European food. \u00a0They should stick to what they do best which is probably baking? Good breads, \u00a0pastries.. Food... hmmmph... I haven't tried French cuisine yet.. so I can't say much about that.. but Asian in Europe, they should just give it up. \u00a0But this place, \u00a0the Ambiance. Wow, \u00a0totally killed it! Check out the photos! The serve ware.. I think that's what I came here for. \u00a0Lol. And, \u00a0I must say, \u00a0London, everything is overpriced.. but This restaurant was decently priced.. so I totally commend them. \u00a0What took away the 2 stars was the flavor and the traditional Korean. \u00a0So.. the staffs were really nice.. they seated us like a fast food way.. by the window.. lol. They were full.. anyway, \u00a0we ordered King prawns for appetizer, \u00a0spicy beef soup for my hubby and I asked the server if the beef rib eye was part of the bulgogi or not..and she said yes.. but a different type of meat that's why it is more expensive. \u00a0So, I chose the rib eye. \u00a0But when I got the order, the beef tasted so bland, like it did not have any flavor.. and remember, \u00a0bulgogi is a marinated meat. \u00a0So ...I asked her again.. and that's when she found out it was a totally different dish. \u00a0So they had to changed it. \u00a0I told my hubby, \u00a0you know, \u00a0a restaurant cannot just throw in a dish that's made of a wholesome insipid meat. \u00a0I can do that at home. \u00a0You go to a restaurant because you want something divergent. \u00a0That meat was not any different. \u00a0That should not even be in the menu. \u00a0But they were nice enough to change it with no questions asked. \u00a0We were stuffed. \u00a0Totally worth the price, after I had my real bulgogi. You just expect side dishes when you go to a Korean restaurant.. that's where they lost the Korean tradition, \u00a0hence the other star. \u00a0You have to pay for the side dishes. \u00a0Lol. Understandable. \u00a0Lol. Everything here in London is an extra euro. But again, \u00a0so far, \u00a0this is the most reasonable and palatable restaurant I've been to. \u00a0And modern fusion at that! Love it! For London... 3 star is pretty good coming from me! By the way the soju, I thought $5 in the US was allay expensive, hold you breath for the 9euros here! That's like $15us! Lol. 3x the price! Lol. Omg! Highway robbery!",

For main I went for the salmon gui and was pleasantly surprised when it came out. The sweet potato basket wasn't quite what I expected. The sweet potato had been shredded into some type of crunchy nest but it complimented the salmon well. I order rice as well but didn't really need it as we ordered jap chae as a side which was fine. Found room to try a dessert too and went for the golden chestnut ice cream. Tasty but was kind of a glamourised vanilla. All in all a good experience and very busy restaurant which says it all.",

The soju isn't authentic either, it's too sweet (the pear) and barely tolerable. Luckily, my friends were happy but I was not. I felt like a terrible hostess. The pro's: its walkable from the British Museum. They have a gluten free menu. The cons: all of the above.",

    "text": "Having worked in the area for a while, Kimchee is typically referred to as a landmark with the description, That Korean place that always has the queues out the front. If you have the good fortune of spending any time inside, the reason for the queues becomes abundantly clear.It's really, really good.I'll readily confess that I didn't really notice the names of all the dishes and drinks that were flying around the table, but that's possibly no bad thing and you could have quite an interesting evening from just randomly pointing and ordering from the selection available in this consciously Korean place. I know we had the eponymous fermented cabbage speciality, Kimchee, which was simultaneously weird and compelling, and made for an excellent component to more familiar menu options such as fried chicken bits, and a sort of pancake/omelette thing with seafood mixed through it. My personal star tip is for the steak tartare, which was nothing short of stunning and not at all what I expected.We were lucky enough to pair each group of plates with a Korean drink \u00a0such as a fermented rice milk drink and a plum-based spirit. Quite a departure from what the Western palate's familiar with, and though I'd hesitate to order any of them alone they too provided a fascinating contrast & counterpoint to the cuisine.Based on the fact Kimchee doesn't take reservations (although the queue turnover is quite rapid) it'd probably be a handy and different option for small groups with a good sharing mentality. The bench-style seating (think Wagamama) probably rules it out for an intimate dinner for 2, but it's keenly priced options make it handily informal. The owners have gone to incredible attention to detail with the decor, plates and glassware, and this all adds to give the place a busy informality without falling into cheap, cheerful & chaotic.As well as being my first run at Korean food, this was also my first VIQ event \u00a0two serves of massive luck in one!Based purely on personal preference I found the cocktails and alcoholic drinks to be a lot sweeter than I'd customarily drink, but am very eager to head back and explore some of the main dishes: from what we got to taste, it's easily worth a 20 minute queue.",

    "text": "Don't go here for your regular Chicken Katsu Udon \u00a0go for an adventure in Korean cuisine. Apparently there's no major culinary differences between North and South Korea except that the latter use wholewheat rather than buckwheat flower?! Though I'd be very surprised if you could get anywhere near the quantity and quality of food in the whole North as you do in this lovely South Korean restaurant in Holborn, even if you were called Kim and were born into the ruling family. And I learned that if you really did want to eat the best of Korean food surrounded by brutalist 70s architecture you always try one of a dozen restaurants in New Malden. On the other hand if you want a cool candle-lit relaxing ambience which mixes modern furnishing with trad touches you can do a lot worse that find a suitable spot in Kimchee, depending on whether you're a single, couple or group, and whether it's for business or pleasure; Adam the genial general manager reckons it's much more fun in a group either way and if you want to make a party up that's culturally representative of this clientele you'd need to be 30% Korean.Seafood here offers the tastiest and most innovative dishes: Prawn Mari, Pa Jeon (octo-squid) and Crab 'sticks' were faboluous. The meat's very fresh and nicely spiced \u00a0try the dish in a steak tartare type pile with sesame seeds. The veggie options seemed to need hotter spice to make them interesting but I always think that. Drink each course down with a pretty plum wine or Korean non-fatal vodka. Indeed, on the basis of the food alone, mine would have been a five star rating. The cocktails were certainly very SWEET for me, not that one can complain when you are offered so many, and my feminist friend even told me afterwards that I appeared to be really enjoying the pink girly one. Now, of course, I wasn't.",

From the moment you walk in and take in the beautiful wooden interior you feel transported somewhere far away. We sat in the what i can only describe as a tranquility section and was thentaken downstairs to the new floor which will be opened to the public soon and will add another 100+ seats. We were welcomed by the manager and head bartender and they told us about Kimchee and what the evening had in store. We sampled various Koreen dishes with wines to match: Seol Jung Mae (14% plum wine) this reminded me a little of sherry and was served with Prawn Mari a rice paper filled with prawns,rice and veg and a mustard dipping. The taste was fresh and an excellent starter. A tastier and healthier alternative to a spring roll.Bek Seju (rice based wine with ginseng and herbs) \u00a0a refreshing wine this was served with Pa Jeon a seafood pancake (this was filled with plump pieces of seafood) This was nothing like i expected, it reminded me of a fritatta \u00a0i can happly recommend this dish.Makgeolli (fermented rice milk) this is a very popular drink but not for me this came with several dishesdeep fried soft shell crab, gogi mandu (chicken dumplings) and Kimchee Jeon (cabbage pancakes)The Kimchee Jeon were very tasty and my favourite dish in this section though i must point out i enjoyed all the dishes!We were then served Kimchee which they make on the premises from scratch \u00a0pickled cabbage with a chilli paste \u00a0this wasnt to my taste but we were with a real kimchee enthusiast in our midst who said it was one of the best she had tasted so it must have been good.Out came a plate of Yuk Hwae (steak tartare to you and me) i couldnt bring myself to sample this as i like my meat well done but everyone else seemed to love it and the manager told us it was one of there popular dishes.Out came a rice paper basket filled with chicken Kanpoongi \u00a0a mouth watering deep fried chilli chicken in garlic sauce.We were then given 2 cocktails Bora blue (blueberry liquer mixed with Soju crushed ice and fresh blueberries) and Kimberry Makageoldi (a raspberry liquer based)finally to end the evening we were given a shot of Soju a Korean clear spirit.This was my first taste of Korean food and wow i was impressed. I have promised to take my husband here and i have a inkling of some of the dishes to order. A big thankyou to Kimchee for an excelllent night and Qype for introducing me to yet another tasty cuisineThe quality of food and surroundings would make you think that the prices would be high but they are not so i can 100% recommend this place for any occasion",

Innovative, flavoursome, beautifully presented food at very reasonable prices. Showcasing the length and depth of the Korean food spectrum, all served in a sleek and bustling setting. The waiting staff are attentive, considering how busy the place actually is and informative. With such high turnover of customers, not everyone can be serviced 10/10 all of the time. Just don't let that ever put you off for this place is a real find and one I recommend time and time again.",

It's definitely a solid option for this area of town and a step up from some of the nearby eateries. The only downfall is that service is incredibly spotty, especially if you're dining solo or in a small group. More often than not I do takeaway because dining in is simply too much of a hassle. Not sure about about authenticity, but it's worth a stop if you're around and need a full meal, especially on Sundays when the center shuts down.",

    "text": "For photos - please go to chopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 \u00a0Kimchee is a new restaurant that opened up in Holborn. It took over the ex-Matsuri site that had a fire incident last year which it seems that they never managed to recover from. It was another ladies' catch up dinner and the opening of Kimchee was perfect timing. On the day we went, it was actually Opening Day 2. Even at 8pm, the place was jam packed and we waited for 40 minutes to get a table. While waiting, there was a gentleman who asked if he could join us. Sorry mister, ladies only and trying to cut the queue is a no no! When you get to the front of the queue, a lady kindly invited us to wait inside at a scenic garden patch of stone pebbles and fountain with a wall of Korean characters glowing against a dark setting. Turn your head and you are greeted by the grill section where you could see the chefs busily grilling away. We were finally called and upon being seated, we were informed that any skewers orders will take around 20 minutes due to how busy the kitchen was. We quickly placed our orders as most of us were starving by then. While waiting for our orders, we looked around and it was a huge place. I almost did not notice that there were 2 sections to the place that had a cage like wall dividing both sections. Most tables have seats of 6 with bar-like benches along the side for lone or double diners. I liked the decor with the lanterns motif used for the lights; the whole place had a streamlined unassuming posh feel to it. Korean tea/green tea (per pot) - It was quite amusing when our drinks arrived as the Korean tea came in a huge earthen pot that looked like those Chinese clay pots used to boil herbal soup. Kimchee - The crunchy texture and sweetness of the cabbage is more prominent in this version with the heat of the chilli hitting you only right at the end. Not overly spicy which is good for the non-kimchee lovers but bad if you like it super spiced! Sukju Namul - A cold dish of bean sprouts in sesame oil & garlic dressing. This was quite normal and a good one to order if you like bean sprouts. On a side note, I'm quite used to having side dishes given automatically to each table free in Sydney and other countries that should all these side appetisers really be charged and accepted in London? Yuk Hwae - One of my favourites in Korean cuisine. Yuk Hwae comprises of thinly sliced raw beef that is semi-frozen with pears that have been sliced to the same length and size as the beef to bring out the refreshing sweetness. Topped with sesame sauce and egg yolk to give an aromatic creamy balance. The Yuk Hwae was one of the better ones I've had in London. It is such an amazing summer dish when made right. The one from Kimchee was good, the sweetness of the pear slices paired well with the beef. The dressing was light with just the right amount of sesame to accentuate the flavours. The beef slices could have been set to a more semi-frozen state so that it gives that crunchy texture but this is just nitpicking here. I am already happy that I did not get one that has been drowned in sesame (so many places do that) such that you don't get all the other elements that make this so good. Jap Chae - I really like the Jap Chae in Asadal which is quite close by, actually that was our Plan B if we couldn't get in to Kimchee. We all loved the Jap Chae here. Sesame oil and soy sauce that has clinged to each and every strand of glass vermicelli noodles, delicious! Pa Jeon - There were 3 Korean pancakes on the menu but we decided to go for the traditional version which is made with spring onions and seafood mix, served with soy and chilli sauce on the side. The pancake was too doughy and it didn't have that slight crisp exterior. The flavours were drowned out by the too generous proportion of the doughy batter. Spicy calamari - Spicy calamari was quite ordinary. The calamari itself was good but the batter was not deep fried enough and was a tad bland. The vegetables that came with it were good though. Crab Tuigim - This was quite a disappointment. Deep fried soft shell crab should be crispy with the oil mixed into the juices of the crab and batter for that oh-so-good deep fried taste. Kimchee's version was not deep fried enough and the soft shell crab was still quite fresh because of that. None of us liked this one. Bulgogi - Bulgogi is another favourite that people like to order and we were no exception. Described as thinly sliced beef that has been marinated in a blend of fruits, soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, onions and garlic, this was GOOD! Tenderly soft and juicy. Scallop skewer - The scallop had a slight stringy texture and charred exterior from being grilled while it was still semi-soft in the middle. The sauce was really good and more should have been given as what we got was not enough to bring out the taste. I recommend that you try to mop up every bit of that sauce with your",
