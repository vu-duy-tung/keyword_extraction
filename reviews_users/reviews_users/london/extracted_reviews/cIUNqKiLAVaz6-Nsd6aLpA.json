Some seating outside but overlooking a narrow pavement and busy street so I wouldn't realy fancy sitting outside to be honest. Not very private. The staff were helpful and friendly and the food came so quick I thought we hadn't ordered yet! They do a tapas kind of menu and you can also order a la carte. We tried both methods. Portion sizes where reasonable and so were the prices. We had the drunken seafood rice (as reommended by another reviewer) and it was delicious. We also tried the Satay chicken. Nothing special but it came with a decent, non salty peanut sauce and another syrupy sauce, both of which were delicious. We also had the Asparagus and scallops (very tasty), and an Aubergine dish (don't eat those green things, they aint peas!!!). All in all, pretty nice experience.",

Homemade food made with love for a small group is always better than mass quantities of food made for the public, but this food is still amazing. Order the pineapple fried rice, which comes in an actual pineapple and is full of shrimp and veggies. They will make your Jungle Curry (which can be hot enough to burn your tastes buds off) to your tastes if you need it a little milder. The menu is more traditional than some of the other Thai restaurants in London; authenticity is what I am looking for when I want Thai food. If you are just looking for a good curry on the other had you can always try Thai Metro the sister restaurant to Siam Central. All of the restaurants along Charlotte Street are packed with people on a warm summers night and they will usually open up their windows and doors, which creates a great atmosphere.",

I forget how much exactly, but it's something close to \u00a37 (which for a two-course hot meal isn't bad). The main meals themselves are the same price when ordering from the main menu. We sat downstairs on Tuesday for a dinner for about 12 people. The staff coped with us all well, and our food came out quickly but with no corners cut. NB.

    "text": "The fact that Siam Central is my local has nothing to do with anything. Living in the West End, we're surrounded by numerous and sundry restaurants, a significant number of them Thai. There's Thai Metro (bland), Busaba Eathai (no desserts!) and even Soho Thai, which I thought was ok. But nothing actually comes close to Siam Central ~ not in taste, price and consistent delivery of a brilliant product. Siam Central also has a unique Thai tapas menu ~ a collection of small dishes to share, including tamarind duck (topped with tamarind and palm sugar), flash fried tofu (with fried slices of garlic) and chicken & prawn toast. Other interesting tapas style dishes include weeping tiger (seasoned beef sirloin with soy chilli sauce), spiced salted squid and Singha beer battered seafood. Mains at Siam Central are more traditionally Thai ~ we shared a pineapple fried rice, duck panang curry, chicken pad thai and a chilli & basil stir fry with beef. One word I can think of to describe their food is flavoursome, because that's what it is \u00a0nothing is ever bland and everything is infused so beautifully with herbs and spices that you just breathe in the goodness before diving in for a full mouthful that doesn't. ever. disappoint. Another great thing about Siam Central is their choice of desserts, from fried ice cream to coconut crepes (pandan crepes filled with dessicated coconut), chilled mango mousse and even fresh mango with sticky rice when the season allows (ie not right now in this never ending winter we're having). I always order the coconut crepes because my tastebuds dictate me to. I do have to admit though, a couple of times they've cooked the crepe a touch too long so it's almost crispy (bad) but done right, this is one of those desserts that make you feel like you're sitting by the street side at Patong Beach, slurping up deathly hot tom yum soup, and cooling your flaming mouth on the local sweets. Anyway no website \u00a0tick. No PR to speak of \u00a0tick. But a queue every weekend night? Surely people who know know, and we're onto a good thing. Make sure you make a reservation if you plan to dropping by, especially on a weekend. And enjoy!",

They guys are convinced that this branch is nicer, and more expensive but I couldn't tell. This one may look less 'budget', but it's charlotte street, it's never going to look too shabby is it? So here's the deal: Order off the lunch menu, get some yummy thai curry, eat thai curry, go back to office. There's nothing that makes you want to stick around, but the food is good. There's worse places, I like it here. But it's not exactly blowing me away, despite the amount of chilli they add to their food. On that note, if someone could bring me glass of water I asked for next time, that'd be nice. I didn't push them, I drank my work mates beer instead, but why do they always forget your water?

    "text": "This is an ideal restaurant to have a tasty meal with a beer on a Friday night, for a good price. It's a short walk from Goodge St tube station.We arrived at about 7:30pm and the restaurant looked full. We were acknowledged and invited to wait for two minutes for a table. Indeed, two minutes later, we were invited to go downstairs where we were met by another staff member who showed us to a free table. The tables are close together and ours had the residual stickiness of a place where a number of people had already dined tonight.We also chose the mixed selection of starters. \u00a0This had the usual things that you would expect: prawn toast, satay chicken, etc. \u00a0My favourite is the prawn toast which I save for the end as a kind of \"starter dessert\". \u00a0We ordered two main-sized dishes to share: Penang curry with duck and Pad Thai with chicken. My wife was attracted to the green papaya salad on the menu, so we ordered that too. \u00a0I liked how the Pad Thai came with the chopped peanuts and bean sprouts on the side, so you could control your allocation. It works for me because I like the peanuts but don't like the bean sprouts. The duck slices in the curry were cooked as I like it.The overall bill was a touch over \u00a340 including 10% service charge. \u00a0This is pretty reasonable for a Friday night dinner out in London.",

This time we were lucky that we could be seated straight away (with only 1 empty table). The customer service was fab. I explained we're in a rush (we literally had 30 mins to order, eat & pay before the movie started). The food arrived at a good time (not so fast that they nuked the food). We loved the salt & pepper squid as well as the chicken satay. If a Thai restaurant can't make a good chicken satay, then there is no hope. My partner orderd a Mussaman Chicken Curry whilst I had the Thick Rice noodle with duck. The main was good, but not excellent.I still cannot decide whether I prefer Busaba to Siam Central. They are both as good although during the meal I sensed that they may have used MSG in their food. I'm not a fan of MSG, hence the 3 star. If you're in the area... give it a go. We will be trying the Thai Metro to compare the two :)",

There was lots of chicken, and good amount of veggies, but a small portion of noodles. It was nicely flavoured with soy and added lime, which added more taste to the dish. I would be more happy if they added more noodles, but everything used in the dish tasted very light and fresh. The staff were polite and friendly. For someone like myself from Canada, the restaurant looks and feels more like an European caf\u00e9, but it's the food that really matters. I would definately go back to this restaurant if I wanted some Thai in London.",

Haha. - Chicken Skewers: pretty good. Would've preferred maybe a sweeter peanut sauce, but it was still good. - Pineapple Fried Rice: really good and came in the pineapple, so presentation was lovely. - Pad Thai: also tasty. It was quite a lot of food for two people, so there was plenty of leftovers. When I reheated the pineapple fried rice a day later, it was still really really good.Overall, we had a good experience.

The staff was super friendly and seated us immediately. Drinks were ordered and arrived very timely. Everyone found something they liked on the menu and food came out quite quickly. They even asked which items we wanted as starters and which as mains so we could all eat together, whether we ordered full meals or dim sum style small plates. I got to try several dishes and everything was delicious. The curries are a bit on the too-spicy side for me, but I'm not a fan of spicy foods to begin with. I really can't complain about anything here!",

BUT oh that drunken rice! \u00a0The way the tofu tasted in that one was divine. The restaurant looks small but do not be deceived there is a big downstairs. Came to around \u00a314 each.",

The owner that took my order over the phone also seemed attentive and orderly. Would definitely order delivery again from here!",

Depending where I am when you are reading this.I came here with my favorite London couple and I was the third wheel, though I am married so technically we were a proper car...it just so happened that one of the wheels was somewhere far away.Service was very fast, almost frighteningly fast. Not super nice, but fast. I had chicken pad thai and it was about as good as I was expecting it to be.Basically, this place is fine. I'd choose the good at Metro Thai or Thai Metro or whatever it is called, down the street. It's a little better.Bonus: if you ask for extra water, they may just leave the pitcher at your table. Convenient...but not too polite.",

The place is a bit small at least the upper level of their place is relatively small but it's nice and cozy. The service is always great too! I've only ordered a few dishes here but each one I've ordered is GREAT! My favorites are the Drunken Noodle or the Drunken Fried Rice. Their lunch menu is definitely worth it! All in all you never pay that much and they have a mirad of choices to choose from for a dish. I believe I'm not the only one that feels this way because this place gets BUSY! I might go again this week. YUM.",

Over cooked rice and aubergine, very bland taste.Maybe I am spoiled by Patara, but this was very disappointing.Total price was almost \u00a320,- too much as well IMHO.For me just 2 stars, ambiance was not too good and food below average.",
