Really tastes unique and authentic unlike some other curry houses in London. Great use of herbs and spices. The atmosphere is also great. There's something about the restaurant which makes you feel somewhat at home rather than in a big space with people you don't know. Definitely one of my favourite Indian restaurants in London.

Our waiter, Alex, was the most incredible and knowledgeable waiter I have had in a long time. He helped us order everything and even treated us to a Chocolate Chai at the end of our meal. Alex was very personable and TOTALLY deserves a raise. The atmosphere was warm and moody. And the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting London!

I yelped the closest and best option from where I was, Kings Cross. I walked about 10-15min and when I got to the restaurant, I was shocked to see a long line outside on this late chilly night (8:30pm). I got on line seeing as it should be good since it's so popular. I overheard the wait would be 1hr+! The group ahead of me was about to turn away but the waitress convinced them to stay by accommodating them with outside seating with drinks from the bar before being seated for dinner. Then a waitress came out and passed out warm drinks to everyone waiting outside, it was pretty chilly out so it was very nice. I didn't realize what I was drinking but it was the best drink ever at the moment! I was seated only after 5min of waiting because I was alone and was able to sit at the bar. SCORE! The atmosphere was so chill. The bartenders were so trendy dressed in hipster suspenders. My bartender was super friendly and recommended a few options because I had no idea what to get. I got the cheesy naan and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and then a mango kulfi for dessert. EVERYTHING was sooo good! On top of that, I asked the bartender what drink they gave me outside and I was shocked when he told me it was CHAI! He was so nice that he gave me a free refill! I highly recommend this place when in London! I will definitely come back here on my next visit!",

There is a reason for this but later. Second, yes the line is long. Yes they will tell you an absurd amount of time until you are seated but fear not! There will be little drinks while you are in line, bigger drinks once you get into the downstairs bar and amazing food as your reward. Finally, it will not take as long as they have told you. Which is a neat psychological trick.The atmosphere is probably the one thing I did not love. It is a sweaty, packed and really loud room. Pair this with eastern european waitresses whose high pitched voices do not carry across the gap and it can be difficult to even order. All of that being said, we got exactly what we ordered every time, even if it was difficult to flag someone down for additional beer.The food. I need to say it again, The Food! Amazing, Delicious, Indescribably Good... this is why you wait 40 minutes, shout to be heard with a waitress and endure your neighbor's chair bumping you 15 times during dinner.Go to Dishoom, then go again and then keep going until you have eaten everything!",

I would recommend everything except the tomato and onion salad; it's exactly that, and comes as a side dish with the delicious chicken tikka masala, so don't bother ordering it separately.

Sure we had to queue for an hour to get in but they served us mint tea and sherry while we waited out in the cold October air. I just couldn't get myself to hate such a nice deed.. \u00a0after all it was our decision to stay!Getting in we were told that we had to wait a bit longer until the electronic buzzer on the caller went off and someone came and collected us. So we waited and helped ourselves to the exotically named cocktails. Mine was a \"Bombay\" Colada.. whis is an Indian spiced pina Colada. I did ask for a Mai tai first but learned that the whole idea of Dhishooms was about Bombay and the food and drinks from there.When we were taken to the seats we were told that its best to order food to share so we did:Lamb chops: these were exquisitely grilled with a coating of spice but the gamey taste of the lamb was somewhat retained. I am not a big fan of the lamb being gamey but this was acceptable. The pieces were thicker than I expected and biting into it I tasted the fat which was delicious. I was thinking initially that I have tasted better but in reality I had tasted different as this was unique and as equally as good as I have tasted on commercial road. Black Dhal: wow! Tasted amazing and a great accompaniment to my butter narn. The Dhal reminded me of a black bean but the sauce was thick and rich like a vindaloo without the heat. Paneer: sadly disappointing as I felt it was under done but maybe it's the way they do it in Bombay. Chicken: sadly it was so average I forget what it exactly was called. Vegetables: again some spiced boiled vegetables. Nothing to shout about.The place by the way is huge and is styled like an indian resthouse with everything relating to a Mumbai from the 1950s. A sheer joy to be in and with lots of atmosphere. My only question \u00a0is if they have a Hindi menu which might be more special.",

It was perfectly delicious! Tried it at a different Dishoom later and it was not the same! We paired it with a rose lassi and a mango lassi. And shared the Mattar Paneer with rice. The rose lassi was surprisingly great, we wish we could recreate it at home. Everything was delicious, the service was nice + friendly and the ambient was lovely. We would definitely come back.",

You can't tell who are the waiter compared to the customers but you get nicely welcome and invited to wait in some comfy seat with a buzzer to let you know when you table is ready. Once seated, the lady explained and advice on the menu. And we are ready to share Indian food and have a nice time. Everything we tried except the fish where tasty.The drink especially the lassy was excellent. I am not disappointed at all by this place and would highly recommend it. Some people might say it's not as spicy as in India but still the taste is there and we love it!",

My favorite was the chefs special nalli nihari with added bheja. The meat was so tender and flavorful. Also, I loved the okra fries.

They don't take reservations for the evening but by chance we found that it was possible to make a lunchtime booking. One of our friends was visiting from the States and it seemed like the ideal opportunity to check out Dishoom. The venue was a large open space spread over many levels and the smell of Indian food hits you as you walk through the door more than whetting the appetite. Our server was good at explaining the menu and gave good suggestions on what to order. It seemed like Indian tapas so we ordered a wide range of dishes which we all shared. The highlights were the vegetable samosas, gunpowder potatoes, the Black House Daal and the chicken ruby. There was also a good fish curry which I can't remember the name of. Everything we ordered was eaten.It lives up to the hype, definitely worth the wait although I would book a lunch slot if I ever went again!",

I have been to the Soho location and had a great experience so I was looking forward to my friday night Dishoom plans with eager anticipation. We arrived at around 6:15 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we headed down to the bar. I ordered a mango lassi at the bar and was underwhelmed by the drink. It was too sour and weak on the mango taste. We were seated in the basement space which is quite dark but the booths are quite charming and comfortable. I ordered the Bhel to start which was soggy and missing the \"chatpatta\" flavour of a good Bhel. The pommegranet seeds were a great addition though. For my main I got the mattar paneer and Naan. The curry was great - no complaints. However my naan was not warm when it arrived. This sucks because we all know that a good naan is best consumed hot!My dining partners were surprised that the Ruby Chicken was packed with a spicy punch while the Lamb Biryani wasn't too spicy though it was marked as such on the menu. It's frustrating because you should be able to trust the spice levels on the menu. They were very happy with their roomali roti which was great! My theory is that since we were seated in the basement the food was sitting in the kitchens for a bit before it got brought down. This sucks because it lessens the food experience. Now overall upto this point I would have given this experience a 4 star review. However - when the check came the waiter had added an \"optional 12.5% tip\" onto our bill. When I asked him about it he said it was \"optional\" and there as a recommendation but it had been added into our total which made no sense. So either the waiter was backtracking after being caught in a lie or Dishoom writes their bills where they give the big bold total with an optional tip added in. Regardless of which it is - I really disliked the lack of honesty with the process. I'm from Canada so tipping is actually a very normal thing. However, it shouldn't be added to the bill without being told! Will probably be back for the food and will definitely be checking the bill!",

They are putting a modern spin on Indian cuisine, like putting spices and flavors into things that you wouldn't normally associate with Indian. Their cocktail game is pretty tight also, same concept. It's modern, hip, and decorated in English-influenced colonial Indian style, so it's pretty interesting inside. And, it's only about a 10 minute walk to the train station, so if you have some extra time... pop over for at least a cocktail.",

As always, the atmosphere that dishoom provides is unparalleled. You truly feel like you have stepped into another time and place. The music that they play can actually be purchased too, great for all those dishoom hardcore fans.I ordered seasonal fruits with yoghurt, along with an egg naan 'sandwich' of sorts. The yoghurt was both creamy and flavoursome, with hints of vanilla coming through. The naan was good, but not the amazing I have come to expect at a restaurant like this. The naan was a little on the hard side, and the chutney along with the egg did not offer tastes that were new or unique. Maybe dishoom is just too good for their own sake. I would vote this place as a top 10 London dining experience. Though if you can, go at a later time. Dinner time.",

This was the only 5 star (in my opinion) restaurant that I ate at in London and I have to say that this place is actually incredible. If you want any indicator that this place is great, almost every day there are scores of people lined up outside waiting to get in and get a taste of this delicious meal. We got there at around 5pm and didn't have to wait (we had to head to a show afterwards) so that was fortunate for us! I personally ordered the calamari, Dishoom chicken tikka, garlic naan, and one of their mango ice cream desserts. The calamari was one of my top five calamaris that I've ever had because the flavors and spices gave it a little kick that made the dish perfect. It also had a nice crispiness to it which I loved. The garlic naan paired nicely with the chicken tikka because it balanced out the spiciness of the chicken (which, in all fairness, was not that spicy). Finally, the dessert was fantastic as well. The prices were also pretty decent for a place this good so you should either come early and eat delicious food or wait in line and then eat delicious food. Either way, you have to eat at this place.",

The next day, a friend of mine and I were looking for lunch in King's Cross and ended up here and much to our delight they had a table available outside for us. Overall, the food was excellent, we definitely left very satisfied! It was great that the portions were to be shared and even though we were both starving there was plenty of food for 2 people. I had the Murgh Malai, which was very well seasoned chicken. Everything else we shared including the Vegetable Biryani, Paneer Curry and the House Black Daal which were all awesome and packed full of flavor as well! Would recommend those few options if you have a vegetarian/pescatarian friend like mine. Our server, Jimmy, also provided excellent service to us! He was super friendly and even allowed us to try to the House Black Dial on the house, which never happens to us when dining in London. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family looking for a great Indian restaurant in London! I'll be back soon!",

The old Indian Bollywood songs playing on makes you jive while you spend time on the selection of some delectable indian food options. Courteous staff. Also the authentic cutting chai is served with bum maska for true Indian tea lovers. This place is worth ever pound spent",

    "text": "I couldn't possibly say enough good things about Dishoom. Everything about it was fantastic. We made a booking for 4 at Sunday lunch time although there weren't many people waiting when we arrived. The first thing that hits you are the wonderful aromas of the spices drifting out, even a short walk away. The restaurant itself is huge however it doesn't feel cavernous of impersonal because of the decor and feel. Service was perfect - enough information to help us choose (was so hard as sooo many amazing sounding dishes to choose from!) but not in your face. We started with the Far Far and Okra Fries (suggested by our waiter) served with 3 sauces. The fries are cooked in a light batter that reminded me a little of tempura, but with spices. I could live on them! So delicious with just the right amount of crisp. We also ordered the Bang lassi and Rose & Cardamom lassi which were both wonderful and fresh tasting. We then moved on to the Pau Bhaji and Calamari. Again, both were amazing. The calamari was cooked perfectly and was so tender. We shared the Masala Prawns (lovely, charred, spicy), the chicken curry (so tender and full of creamy, spicy flavours), spicy lamb chops (to die for!), and the best dish was definitely the Daal. It was so tasty - I could have eaten only that! We mopped it up with a roti and naan. For sweet I tried the pineapple crumble with custard and it was so so good. I was full after lunch but managed to finish the crumble without any problems. I couldn't recommend Dishoom more highly. If I could I would give it 10 stars!! :)",

The concept is similar to how it is in India as well where food are served in small portions and meant to be shared. Price for each dish averaged between \u00a35 to \u00a39. The service was impeccable with attentive and friendly servers. All-in-all, an amazing experience. Definitely worth a return.",

I found most of the dishes were sweet, as if the chef replaced spice with sugar. The wait for a table was a killer, so advise to get there very early. The menu selection is limited and the portion size was small so really you are paying for the service (even though it's a separate charge on your bill). Really it's a shame, as the service is probably in the top ten in London (if you discount the waiting time), but its just not Indian food as expected, more like sweet tapas with a Indian twist",

    "text": "W O W! My only two even slightly negative comments are: this was not an easy place to find without GPS (the map on their website is NOT clear!), and we waited longer to get the check than we did between ordering and getting our food which is just plain annoying.The FOOD however was divine, absolutely wonderful and inventive. We had fried okra, which my 16 year old daughter discovered was a lot spicier three minutes after the first bite than she reckoned on. I adored it! The okra is not fried whole as I've had it before, but rather in thick slivers and the coating has lime and chili in it. I also really enjoyed the garlic naan, which was offered with or without butter- I went for with of course. Murgh malai (chicken with garlic, ginger, coriander stems and cream) was not spicy but flavorful and enjoyed by my daughter, I had the mango paneer salad, vegetable samosas and bowl of greens. This last was quite yum but had a LOT of sauce...if we had had rice it might have soaked it up but we went with roti and naan so it didn't add much. I was truly looking forward to the dessert called \"kala khatta gola ice\"... but sadly they were out. So they offered us complementary chai and when we said \"no thanks\" ( as we wanted tea and scones at the V&A later) the server surprised us with complementary ice creams! The cinnamon was intensely flavored, not necessarily a bad thing...but the chili ice cream (yup, a slightly orange concoction) was downright sneaky! The first taste was smooth, creamy, slightly sweet and then POW! your tastebuds come under assault from the spicy chili. I managed four bites before putting down my spoon.We went Saturday afternoon around 2:15 and waited less than five minutes to be seated, less than ten before we ordered, less than ten to get our food...but almost twenty to get our bill. I didn't add to the included 12.5% service charge, but I didn't subtract anything either...Try this place if you have a varied palate, especially if you like your food spicy!",

Our server, Mat was sassy and fun and recommended delicious food. We order the raita (cucumber yogurt), which perfectly complimented our order of murg malai (grilled chicken with some lovely spices). We also had the best curry ever: chicken ruby! Spicy, but full of flavor that left you wanting more. Also, we had the number one bartenders on the planet. It was me and my two best friends in our party, and bartenders Jan and Pavel took GREAT care of us. I've never had service from a bartender, let alone TWO bartenders, that was this amazing. They made us delicious drinks on the spot. These two gentlemen are definitely the reason I will be back incredibly soon! Thank you Jan and Pavel!! Dishoom was the best dinner my friends and I had in London. The food and service was out of this world. Did I mention they gave us some delicious chai drink while we waited in line? Yeah.

I had the chicken tikka (super flavorful, but a tad on the salty side), black house daal (delish - perfectly balanced flavors... recommend this with jasmine rice), and a virgin bhang lassi (highly recommend this smoothie-like drink, especially if you're not too good with spice - this will cool you down).

We finally get seated for dinner and man that dinner was the most amazing dinner I have ever eaten. I can't remember what we ordered because a friend ordered it for us. I tell everyone if you go to London you have to go here if you like foods from India and the experience alone should get you here. The place is a really cool atmosphere too so a plus all the way.

The food is out of this world. I wish I had two stomachs so I could've tried more things. We started with the lamb samosas which were amazing: crispy, not greasy, and spiced to perfection. There were three sauces that went from mild, medium to spicy and I preferred the slightly sweet mild sauce. Next was the house chai. This is the best chai I've ever had so far. It was so good I forgot to take a picture until it was just a few drops at the bottom of the glass. For our mains we had mattar paneer and mahi tikka with garlic naan. The vegetarian curry was the perfect level of spiciness for me (mild) and I inhaled it quite quickly. The garlic naan was perfect to mop it up with. The mahi was so good. It was clearly very fresh and done perfectly.I also tried the mango and fennel lassi and the pistachio kulfi. A kulfi is pretty much a lassi in popsicle form. It was a lovely way to cool things down and satisfy my sweet tooth.I dare say we had a perfect dinner.",

I've heard Indian food is great in London, so I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed.We went at around 6:30 on a Thursday and waited for an hour for a table. We didn't mind because they have a great bar downstairs that they bring everyone who is waiting to be seated. The atmosphere is very cool at the bar and in the restaurant in general. Waiting for an hour didn't seem too bad because of the great cocktail list they have.We had heard that a lot of people usually split plates, but since we all had different preferences, we got our own. I had the lamb with the bowl of greens and garlic naan. All of it was fantastic. Others at the table got the cheesy naan and they said that was also great.It wouldn't be a place that I was a regular at since it's always so busy, but it's a really fun place to go with a group, and the food is very good.",

You can grab a meal or get afternoon drinks or even work away on your laptop (lots of outlets and free wifi too!). A real communal place.I came for their Indian style breakfasts. Hubby and I split The Big Bombay - an Indian take on the classic English breakfast - and on a whim I ordered the bacon naan roll to boot.* The Big Bombay (scrambled eggs, 4 slices streaky bacon, 2 sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushrooms, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns \u00a311.50) - sounded terrific but wasn't quite as good in person. The bacon and sausage were good though I liked the bacon more than the sausage. The scrambled eggs, baked beans and pau buns were okay. The grilled field mushrooms were really good. It didn't really add up to anything memorable though. Just bits and pieces of good and okay food. 3.5 stars* bacon naan roll (4 pieces of naan bread wrapped about slices of streaky bacon smeared with tomato chili jam \u00a35.50) - simply the BEST naan I've ever had. Reminded me a lot of the pizza crusts that come out of those fancy brick ovens. The bread was chewy and charred deliciousness. I would come back simply to get an order of those to gnaw on. The bacon and tomato chili jam were a great addition. 5 starsHubby and I both agreed the bacon naan roll was the star of the show. It's so good that if I ever came back I'd probably just order it again and ignore the rest of the menu.",

You wait in line (because it's really crowded), however they serve you drinks while you're waiting. Once you actually get inside the building they take you downstairs to the bar area, which reminds me of a Disneyland themed dark, old school, yet modern dungeon. You drink and snack for awhile (30-60 minutes) before your table is actually ready! It makes the whole experience (2-3) hours totally worth it. Can be pricey though!

Everyone was very happy with their meals- I had the chicken ruby (the flavor was nice but the meat was a little darker/fatty than I had expected) but after seeing what my friends ate I would try the biryani next time!

We come here every single time we come to London. \u00a0This time we got the naali nihari, the naan,the roti, the lamb samosas, and the dishoom calamari. \u00a0The lamb samosas were small but tasty. The calamari was a tad bit salty. \u00a0However, the Star was totally the nali nihari. Spicy, rich sauce with a tender lamb.The roti was so soft and thin... it was perfect to sop up the sauce to he nihari. \u00a0Only bad point was the service; slow and aloof. \u00a0Can't wait to go back to London for our next visit to dishoom",

Once inside, the place is very spacious and cozy, three levels of dining and drinking, all buzzing with happy customers. Everything we ordered lived up to my dreams of having a great Indian meal while in London. The service is great, drinks also good, and the whole experience felt like a party. I'd definitely recommend this place and wish they would open an outpost in San Francisco!",

    "text": "SO GOOD. SO WORTH IT. Service could be a little better hence the 4 stars.We had heard a couple great things about this restaurant before we took our trip to England and decided to pop in for dinner on our last night in London. Since I had read Yelp reviews about the long waits during peak hours, we came in around 9pm on a Wednesday evening and were sat within minutes. Dishoom is in a beautiful old building (it's a huge place) and the decor is simply stunning. I had already perused the menu (thanks Yelp you always got my back) so I had somewhat of an idea of what we were going to order but were happy to hear our waiter's recommendations before we made our final decisions. We definitely ordered more food than we needed but have nooo regrets. Our dinner at Dishoom was definitely the best meal we had during our 4 day stay in London.Drinks: I ordered the Bombay Colada (NOM) and my partner had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned (also NOM). My partner has had many an Old Fashioned and thought Dishoom's version was absolutely fantastic so that's sayin' somethin'. Appetizer: Dishoom Calamari which was uniquely spiced, just the right about of oily, and perfectly cooked!Entrees: Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Vegetable Biryani, Lamb Boti Kebab, and Garlic Naan. All of it was absolutely delicious. That's all you need to know.Dessert: House Chai (wonderfully spiced and delicious) and the Pineapple & Black Pepper Crumble which was subtly sweet, a good size, and the perfect ending to a great meal.My only complaint would be the service. While good overall, it could be improved considering how great everything else is. The biggest issue for us was that one of the servers spilled a bowl of their Raita right behind us which splattered all over my partner's jacket and shoes as well as my shoes. While they quickly cleaned everything up and gave my partner a cloth to clean himself off, nothing was done after that and our server never mentioned it. Considering how pricey Dishoom is, I would have at least expected an apology or an offer for a free dessert. We were just at Mowgli in Manchester days before and our server told us that she took our naan off the bill for us because it came a little late. In terms of our server, he never refilled our water and it took him about 20 minutes to bring our check to us after we had finished our meal. We noticed other tables around us who were served by him waiting a while for their checks as well.Overall, I LOVE Dishoom and will definitely be back when I'm back in London.",

    "text": "Lunched here yesterday on Sunday with the family at the Dishoom Indian restaurant in London for the very first time. It is situated in a ancient English railway warehouse. The place was abuzzing on our arrival.The Bombay Big Breakfast at an expensive \u00a311.50 was very disappointing, compared to \u00a0Big Breakfast size meals in other London cafes and restaurants (which charged at even half the price). There was bugger-all ingredients on the plate, hardly any grilled streaky bacon or grilled mushrooms to \u00a0be seen , and the fried tomato was quite small in size. Only the two sausages were of normal size. The massala flavour baked beans tasted kinda odd too. Their Chai tea at an expensive \u00a32.50 per small glass although tasty was served only luke warm. I hate luke warm tea!!Also their old wooden styled chairs weren't very comfortable, and the whole place felt very old and cramped. However our waitress was friendly enough. A restaurant is only as good as its last meal. And for that reason alone, I would not return here again in a hurry. It's expensive and the food is nothing really special. Though for many I guess, the Dishoom is good for its authentic old Indian styled restaurant novelty value.. But sorry......... thats not good enough for me!!",

    "text": "My no. 1 dining experience in London! Dishoom serves modern Indian food out of a renovated railway shed built baaaaack in the day. The place is huge, cavernous in fact, and the decor incredible. \u00a0It's like being transported back in time to a first class cabins in the 19 century... lots of dark wood, patterned tiled floors, marble countertops and metal finishings. Anyway, enough about the d\u00e9cor. \u00a0The food... well, it's darn delicious. Every dish we tried was packed full of flavour w beautifully balanced spice and lots of fresh herbs. We got a smorgasboard of dishes and all were to die for but the surprise standout dish for me was their daal, which they simmer for over 24hours so it's absorbed all the delicious liquid. \u00a0Unfortunately this time we didn't have room for dessert but next time I am back in London this week be my first stop.Oh and \u00a0make sure that you go downstairs to the Permit Bar for a drink either before or after dinner. It's got a bit of a speakeasy vibe and the service and drinks are impeccable. \u00a0Try one of their signature cocktails or tipples, as they call them. I'm a negroni fan so couldn't go past Sonia's take on the classic - Hayman's Dry gin, Campari & Dishoom vermouth served with hand carved ice.One last thing... Dishoom doesn't take bookings so I'd recommend getting there early, putting your name on the list and then heading downstairs for a tipple (or two). \u00a0We got there around 6pm and were seated well before 7pm, but apparently the wait can be up to 3 hours during peak times.",

The atmosphere with the dimmed lights is exceptional. In the lower level you will find the \"Permit Room\" bar which creates unbelievable drinks - most of them with an Indian touch to it.The food itself is very tasty - from the naans over the paneer tikka to the daal and the various curries. You can't go wrong with anything. It's a good place to come with friends and share a variety of food. The only problem with this place is the door personnel that often tries to scare you away with an extremely unfriendly attitude and exaggerated waiting times (that actually are never true)",

We wanted an early dinner in the area, and read the reviews about the long waits, so made a booking for 5:45pm thinking it would be empty, because who really eats at that hour? We probably could have walked in at that point, but it was pretty full, and there was a wait by 6:30. We arrived and were seated by a friendly host, but then didn't see a server for more than 15 minutes. People walked past with water jugs, but didn't offer us any, and I had to catch someone's eye to make our order, which seemed pretty silly. There were tons of staff around, so no idea why we had to wait so long to order. Ordered a number of dishes to share based on other reviews, and there were a couple dishes that I would be happy to eat again. The black dal was delicious, and felt like it was reasonably priced. The bhel starter was very good, although inconsistently spiced (it felt like it wasn't stirred together properly), but I would recommend it. I don't get the love for the okra fries, which are a spicy version of something you can get at any BBQ place or TGI-Fridays style place in the US. Nothing special. The roti was obviously not cooked to order as it claimed, since the top was hard and stale. The grilled greens were OK but nothing amazing. The gunpowder potatoes were actually inedible. The spicing was decent, but the potatoes themselves were undercooked, which is never a good thing in a potato. When I asked for the bill, the server noticed we'd only eaten a bite of the potato and asked what was wrong. I said they were undercooked and not good, and he apologised. But of course, he didn't take it off the bill, so I kind of felt like he shouldn't have bothered asking if he wasn't going to do anything about it. The physical space is beautiful, I have to admit. I love the area, and enjoyed walking around the warehouses behind King's Cross. Oh, if I wasn't already disappointed, my visit to the bathrooms sealed the deal. Down in the basement, the whole bar is smoky with incense, which is odd in a restaurant. In the bathroom itself, the smoke from incense was insanely thick, and my clothes ended up smelling like a dirty hippy shop for the rest of the evening. I agree with whoever said that the toilets remind them of an outhouse, weirdly out of place. Basically, it was an interesting experience, and I had one good dish. But I won't be back-- service was slow and not especially professional, food was more expensive than I felt it was worth, and drinks were astronomically expensive. Next time I want Indian food, I'll head for Drummond St instead.",

We got seated straight away when we showed up at 5.30pm on Sunday. I raved about the breakfast in my Shoreditch review but again: bacon and egg naan. That's all you need. Dinner is just as amazing. Far far, chicken tikka, house dahl, calamari, freshly made naan and rotis plus okra fries which are simply incredible to name a few. Expect innovative takes on Iranian/Indian dishes with great flavours and surprisingly amazing prices - I love that the prices are modest despite the ongoing hype with this place.

Sort of like a hipster version of Soda Bottle Openerwala.Will make a point to come here every time I am in London",

    "text": "In a month I've eaten here 12 times and literally eaten and drank everything on the menu. I've weathered wind, rain and ice, for dates, get-togethers and family dinners. And though it's not perfect and you can get better Indian food (if you look REALLY hard) in London, it is the best place I can recommend in London overall. + Breakfast: I thought I knew it all about Dishoom until after a year having dinners I went for breakfast; and I fell in love all over again. The Bacon Egg Naan Roll is delicious; wood smoked bacon with gooey organic egg, a layer of cream cheese and fresh chopped coriander, with the char from the tandoor on the naan. Paired with a sweet and very mildly spiced chilli jam to lighten the smoke and char- I was licking the plate. Which is a beautiful white and blue like your Nanniji might have. The Chicken Keema looked good but wasn't amazing, and I found it too oily. Fire Toast (2-3 pieces) was ok, came lukewarm and a touch dry, but the preserves were nice. The Big Bombay breakfast is awesome, and the Masala Beans yummy; if needing a slight chilli kick (my preference). + Have a Dhoble cocktail to perk up your brunch, or a monsoon malabar coffee for those grim morning-afters. It must be said the coffee isn't great (i.e. barista level), but I like the chicory hit from it. Get a lassi, or ask can they do a sugar cane & lime juice otherwise.+ Lunch: you can't go wrong with with a Frankie roll and a Thumps-Up. Get it into you. Their wine selection is average, but their cocktails are why you are here. Summertime, hit the juleps. Wintertime go for a chota peg. Avoid the Indian Sula wine (overpriced) and Amrut whiskey (sub-par) if you are into those things. Sorry India :(+ Dinner: Aw yisss. I mean, I can write on every item, but no need. Their special, Lamb Nahil Nihari is a leg of lamb originating in Iran and infamous on the streets of Pakistan. The sauce is thick and unctuous and morish, scoopable with the garlic roti. The lamb itself is well cooked and tasty, but I doubt slow cooked (would be better) as it needed to be carved/pried off the bone on both occasions we ordered. A large portion, get to share at \u00a317.50. Don't opt for the brainzzzz (my preference).Headliners are the Chicken Ruby (perfect for those people who think Indian food must be a sauce, meat, and rice), Chicken Berry Britannia (recreation of Caf\u00e9 Britannia in Mumbai), house daal mopped up with roomali (handkerchief) roti, vada pau with a dollop of fresh green coriander chutney, paneer tikka and more. Desserts- probably the only thing I'm not impressed with. The overly heavy Guju Shrikhand & Chocolate Mouse, and the Ghola Ice is divisive among friends. Best opt for a simple kulfi. Pudding wine isn't much to talk about, don't bother with it. Get chocolate chai or a 'Dirty chai' instead.Cocktails/Drinks: all of them. While downstairs go for the juleps and pegs; at the dinner table I love the East India Gimlet.Overall- for its price, service and consistent quality every day all day, it's impossible not to say it's my favourite place to eat in London. Always coming back.",

Everything was amazing except the chicken biryani, which was just ok. I went back two days later for lunch to try a few more things. Order the lamb samosa, pau bhaji, chicken tikka roll, and the choli poori. Be prepared to queue for an hour. They will serve you free chai, mint tea, and sherry while in line, which can be out of the door. Once you get inside you can order a nice cocktail at the bar.",

They do not take dinner reservations under a certain amount of people (I think 6 people). When we were finally seated, the menu was a bit overwhelming because everything sounded so good! We opted for the lamb samosa, chicken tikka masala, veggie biryani, braised lamb that came with naan, and a side of roti. Oh my goodness, we ordered way too much food for 2 people! The tikka masala was juicy! The braised lamb was AMAZING, and by far my favorite dish. The meat fell off the bone. The sauce was so flavorful. All I wanted to do is soak my naan in the sauce!! Overall, if we had to wait an hour, it was definitely worth it. Just plan ahead and make reservations if you can't wait. I'm not sure if the lamb was a special dish for the night or not, but if it's on the menu, order it! You won't regret it. \"",

I find myself obligated to mention the kindness of the staff and there willingness to help. The smile didn't depart their faces.There are two bars offering wide range of alcoholic drinks. Kingfisher beer is a very popular choice here. My friends liked the wine.The food is good but not excellent as some reviewers commented. I find it lacking a pinch of salt to kick out all those spices.I recommend this restaurants for groups of adults and those who want to enjoy a different atmosphere in London.",

Another very nice host walked down offering lemonade and chai to waiting guests. Once a table freed up at the bar area we were offered to come sit and order drinks while we waited for our table. A few minutes later, we were escorted to our table were the menu was explained. We ordered an assortment of dishes a total of 11 for a table of 4. The flavors were rich and went well together. We finished our meal with popsicles (I had the mango one and my husband had the pistachio) Best way to finish our meal. My hubby said the Chicken Tikka was the best he's ever had.

This was surely inauthentic indian food and overpriced for the portion. Their signature dish is daal which is basically lentils and costs very little to make. Everything is significantly overpriced and made to suit westerners. You don't see any actual Indians eating here, of course they are the smart ones and the Brits that do eat here are either gullible or patsys. The lamb chops we got were burnt to a crisp and the naan and roti we got was horribly overpriced was neither crispy, flavorful, nor appropriately portioned.",

I opted for the garlic naan and it was great!Black house daal (4/5): now although this is the \"house special\" I didn't think it was particularly good. It's mostly lentils in there and the sauce wasn't really my favorite.Overall, nice ambiance and good service. Worth a try!",

We ordered the vegetable samosas to start, the house special daal, the dishoom chicken tikka masala, the naan and garlic naan, and the murgh malai. The murgh malai and the daal were probably my favorite dishes but I honestly enjoyed everything I ordered. The samosas were hot and flavorful, the daal was perfect, and the naan tasted almost like homemade naan. Be warned that they charge \u00a33.50 for water so you might as well order their chai tea. Definitely give this a try if you're in the area! Not only was the food good but the ambience was perfect as well.",

The roti was good - soft and easy to take apart, and quite large too (we shared 2). The naan was decent.

The guy behind the bar was very friendly and made my drink right away. It was very refreshing and I ended up having a few more. Once we were seated we ordered some okra and calamari to start. The okra was amazing especially with the Chili chutney. I didn't try the calamari the other guests really enjoyed it. Next we ordered some main dishes. And biryanis to share. The Bowl of Greens is a must! It doesn't look like anything special but the flavour it amazing and the greens are cooked to perfection. The House Black Daal was also very nice and paired with the Gunpowder Potatoes I was in heaven. All the staff were lovely and the waitress we had was very sweet and had a great personality.Overall everyone enjoyed the meal. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I will definitely return.",

    "text": "They like to stress the Persian/Irani heritage of this place, but it is 85% Indian influenced. I won't lie, it's got amazing atmosphere and ambiance. The decor is fabulous, the building is wonderful (love converted warehouses), and it is tres stylish. I sat at the bar because I was a single, though it was not very busy and would have appreciated a booth. I decided to go with the flow and trust them.I think dining has a lot to do with trust when you're not sure on a place or you've never tried it. Yelp reviews and other people's recommendations can only go so far - in the end, it's what your tastebuds want, what your mind thinks is a good value for time and money. I think that for me, I will not be back because of the following:1. When I was seated at the bar, I noticed how blaring loud the music was. Because of the open structure of the warehouse, the two levels in the restaurant allow for the music and chatter from the upstairs to melt in with the downstairs. So when the bartender tried to talk to me, I could not hear over his heavily accented murmurs.2. While gorgeous, the bartenders can't be heard, at least by me. And they returned the favor. So I had to point out my items on a menu so I could be understood.3. I decided on the spicy lamb rice dish with a side of raita. The raita is first rate but the rice dish... well, the meat bits were good, but the rice overall was bland. The side sauces worked temporarily (by the way, who doesn't have salt and pepper out if you're going with the logic of bland rice?) but I felt near the end overwhelmed by the spice, and not enough flavor. The raita was tastier than the entree. Bad sign.4. I didn't want to finish the entree or the raita at the end. I was getting full, but remember my review for Salvation In Noodles when I talked about wanting to have a bigger stomach so I could eat more? I didn't feel that way at all for this place, these dishes, or the service. I think the bartender was disappointed that I wasn't ordering a drink and was confused why I would sit at the bar if I was just going to eat. Look buddy, I was just being polite and following the host's recommendation.5. At the host bar, there's easily four or five employees just standing around talking to each other. Which kind of upset me just because no one bothered to walk over to the bar and at least set things up. The menu was set in front of me after I sat down, thirty seconds later. I know that's a picky thing to complain about and it normally wouldn't be a big deal, but personal touch is really missing from this place, which unlike SIN, doesn't have the food to make up for it.Reasons to go? I dunno, I guess I can tell the bartenders put effort into their cocktails, they have a full bar, it may have been a dud dish I got, it may have been a bad seat, it also may have been the heat of the day that got me a little frustrated since Dishoom wasn't my first choice to eat at. I really wanted curry, and despite a lot of Indian inspired dishes, there was none. Crazy, right?So take my review with a grain of salt. I only wish that they had some to share with me for the dish I got today.",

It was on the way. So we briefly glanced over the menu and decided to give it a go. As soon as the doors opened, we stepped into a futuristic split-level, oddly decorated HUGE space, it felt like a set of Dark City, or The 13th Floor movies. That futuristic 50s, old with modern look. First impression - intriguing!We were promptly ushered to our table. We ordered okra fries and calamari as a starter (both very morish and delicious), followed by gun powder potatoes (nom!), mahi tikka (delicious dry fish, but order a side of something), and a black house dhal (OH-EM-EF-GE, this flavour explosion is a must have).The first time I visited, I was left LITERALLY speechless. The only thing that I was able to put together was profanity and swearing at just how incredibly unbelievable the food was. Honestly, it's witchcraft!Despite what the waiter will suggest, DO NOT share the black house dhal! This magical substance can divide friendships and start a war at the table! We were forced to rely on the trusted rock-paper-scissors to decide who was worthy of the last spoonful. I kid you not!Other deliciousness:- roomali roti - this thing is nearly the size of a beach towel. You could order it instead of rice!- chicken berry Britannia biryani - cooked in a dum pukht, where the pot is sealed with dough and content is cooked until it is tender and bursting with flavour- chicken ruby murray - award winning! And it got us leaving FAT TIPS!But wait! You're not allowed to leave yet! The desserts! What you gotta do is order the pineapple - black pepper crumble, and combine it with the cinnamon ice cream, ARE YOU INSANE! Oh lawd have mercy!Other equally delicious ways to satisfy your sweet tooth are the kulfi ice cream. Have the pistachio one!And just before you leave, order yourself a chai tea. Now that you're ready to do the penguin waddle after consuming what could have fed a small family of 12, welcome to the world of never ever being satisfied with any curry ever again. All in all, we think we are ruined! We have had to set ourselves strict limits and we are not allowing ourselves more than one visit a month. Enter at your own peril!One suggestion - come early if you can. Sometimes you could end up queuing for 3 hours to get a table. Booking is only accepted for groups of 6+",

A friend who travels to India a lot recommended this place.We lucked out and got the last two seats at the upstairs bar, and thank goodness we did because the queue piled up fast. (as a note to those not afraid to wait- we did notice waitresses going out with complimentary shots of sherry). The building itself is beautiful. I have an aversion to cumin, and hence the aversion to indian. So I asked which meals didn't include it. not only was i given an answer, but an outlined menu on which meals could be made without so i desired. The food was incredible. I even ordered one dish out of my comfort zone and i think i will crave it when i return to boston. More importantly were the servers though, and the drinks. oh the drinks. They are craftsman behind the bar. such unique spins on common bar drinks. Bay leaf and green tea infused old fashion, with an accompanying history lesson as the backstory to the inspiration of the drink. Everyone we spoke to was so happy, so personable, so knowledgeable and just lovely to be around. this will become a staple place every time i visit London, without question. Thank you for such a wonderful evening that wont be forgotten.",

When we showed up before 7 there was a lineup all across the front of the restaurant. Although we waited quite a long time, I have never had such a good waiting experience. From drinks provided in the queue, to being moved to the bar as a secondary waiting area, 2 hours actually seemed to go by quickly. The place was well staffed and my friends and I became quite convinced that a girl's sole job was to go around making sure incense was always burning everywhere. Atmosphere was great. The building is massive, it's crazy to think how long we had to wait considering all the tables actually in the restaurant. Food and drinks were stunning. We were 6 all sharing so I can't actually confirm everything I tried, but it was all amazing. Will definitely go back.",

The theme is Bombay cafes in the 1920s and 1930s when prohibition was enforced so alcohol could only be drunk with a permit and they were the only place that everyone all Indian castes could go.Right down to the drinks served in apothecary glasses, the historical pictures on the wall and the real research that has got into this place, aligned with their quest for to authenticate flavours, \u00a0makes this brilliant place.Bookings are hard to get at short notice and turning up means a 1.5 hour wait, even on a weeknight. They \u00a0do make you feel very comfortable while waiting in the drinks area, but probably not worth waiting quite this long.The average age is probably late twenties and there are few people in the mid 40s and above, this is a trendy cool place and is quite noisy as goes with places for such a young crowd. The service levels are high, they really know how to talk about what a serving and whoever runs this place is bang. \u00a0However the waiters do have that slight cold edge of being on sales commission.It is not cheap, but not overly expensive.An authentic a big recommendation, that you will enjoy and so will the people you take.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Dishoom after much anticipation. I loved the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant and we were lucky enough to get seated quite quickly. The staff were very friendly and we were served some nice chai tea while waiting to be seated. Although they initially told us it would be a 45-60 minute wait we were seated in about 20 minutes. I had the mango lassi to drink which was very refreshing and not too sweet. The waiter recommended 3/4 plates per person which was more than enough food and we had enough to take leftovers home. The best dishes were the calamari, the matar paneer and the black daal lentils. Everything was quite spicy so be careful if you don't like spicy food. I was very impressed with the price for the quality of food, nothing we ordered was more than about 8 pounds. Overall great experience and a beautifully designed restaurant.",

    "text": "Dishoom is the epitome of fusion; everything from the food menu, to the array of drinks to the layout of the restaurant and even the staff members are a wonderful mishmash of ingredients and culture. A replica of a Bombay Cafe, Dishoom represents a Persian influenced restaurant located in Bombay. The inside of Dishoom is certainly elaborate and transports you to another world. Their lamb and chicken is succulent, their prawns are sweet and their salad is fresh. My only criticisms of their food are that they have not allowed the Naan and Roti bread to rise much but instead enabled them to become a little dry with less flavour and whenever they have grilled the food the exteriors have been somewhat burnt and blackened. Both the drinks and desserts hold pleasant surprises and tasteful combinations. The waiter said I was brave to try the Kala Khatta Sharbat which contains kokum fruit juice, chilli, citrus and black salt but actually far from being a decision I would live to regret, as with most of their ventures, they succeed in achieving the combination of interesting yet pleasant. Unfortunately the toilets are buried far away and underground so try not to eat so much that it's hard to move, or drink so much that you would urgently need to relieve yourself. It is remarkable however how uniquely designed even the toilets are to suit the whole image of the restaurant. I am not a fan of smelling incense at every turn but all-round wonderful to behold, Dishoom is top-notch for originality.",

    "text": "I have been waiting for an opportunity to try Dishroom and couldn't resist not to try the new King Cross branch when I heard about a soft launch. We queued for 1hr 20mins in the pouring rain. But thank you for Dishroom providing us entertainments to keep us amuse in the queue.There are a range of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcholic) to order and all look interesting. \u00a0I started off with one of the rose lassis and was hoping to finish the evening with the Bailey Chai which was unfortunately sold out.The food was good but could had been warmer as most of our cooked dishes were luke warm. I enjoyed the okra fries and the Bhel which we started as an appertiser.I love the chicken ruby over the chef special (nalli nihari). But both was nice with roti or naan bread. Instead of steamed rice we had the chicken berry britannia which reminded me of another version of fried rice.There are a range of grills and we orderd a few to try. My favourite has to be the Murgh Malai which used chicken thigh that give it that smooth succulent chicken texture.Dessert we tried the pisatchio kulfi and the pineapple and black pepper crumble. I could not remember tasting or seeing any black pepper. It was like apple crumble but pineapple instead. The service was really slow but it has improved since the soft launch. We struggled to get service and getting a menu or making an order took ages.Overall good place and will return!",

    "text": "This review is mainly about the experience, rather than the food. It was an insidiously windy hike up from Kings Cross station to Dishoom and we were horrified to be told on the door with a smile that waiting time for a table was an hour and 45 mins, ... but not as horrified as we were when we were then told that there was a waiting time for the bar that we had been directed to wait in !!! We were also told that we couldnt order drinks whilst wiating for room at the bar 'because by the time the drinks are made your table would be ready ...' Not sure what that said about the waiting time for either. So we stood by the doors gazing upon the restaurant, a bar, people sitting eating and drinking ... for what felt like a thirsty 10 mins or more until we were able to go down to the bar that we would be waiting in. During that time we were able to appreciate 2 things : the visuals were awesome, the noise sucked. But the interior was lovely. i actually started to feel pangs of longing to be back in the asian subcontinent, such was the nostalgic attention to detail in every part of the sprawling comfortable 3 floor (? 4 floor ?) building. \u00a0And somehow , despite the dodgy soundtrack (a few guitar band indie-pub tunes) , all the vocal clamour and people noise added to the bustling-India ambience. In the event we 'only' had to wait for an hour and a quarter for a table, by which time I had kind of lost my appetite. Cocktails were good, as they should have been; pre -made, which mate be contentious or perhaps marketed as a plus point. The Gimlet was awesome, other nice mixes. Served on a hand-cut shard of ice which was definitely the epitome of cool.Food : \u00a0I was looking forward to their signature Black House Daal, and when it came it was good, but i wasn't too bothered about paying too much attention to it because I fell in love with the Roomali roti, soft, delicate, big, warm. Likewise with the Gunpowder potatoes \u00a0and Biryani and Mutter Paneerm which my three friends loved. \u00a0I felt the tastes were comfortable and pleasant, not quite as complex as I would have liked, but I was brought up on a Sri Lankan palate and perhaps we are notoriously exacting when it come to food ....The service was great, and the ambience in the restaurant was also awesome, i preferred it to the subterranean bar. The restaurant was a really great combination of relaxing, chilled, intimate, but feeling as though you are in the thick of things and able to gaze on some activity. Looking around, it felt like this would probably be the case from every table, and it was here that I felt that I could almost be in India. By that time the tunes had changed to seem more congruous. So, my friend said that the website says no need to book : I would come back, but I would not wanna be faced with that wait again, I would love to check out their other locations, im hooked on the interiors and i would definitely bring friends. I wanna to try more of their dishes and spend more time at the restaurant table eating",

Friendly services, except a few hiccups here and there.. and nice environment. We went for lunch and the wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad comparing to dinner hours. We asked our waiter about portion sizes and he suggested 5, 6 dishes for two of us. (Either we looked starving or I never knew people eat that much there). We ended up ordering only 3 dishes + garlic nan and we were stuffed. Every dish was delicious!Although they forgot our Okra Fries. The waiter apologized and brought it out later, said it was on the house but when the bill came, it was charged. We didn't bother to correct him since we did order and finished it. The okra fries were a bit salty and a few pieces were stringy. Overall it was great and we walked out full and happy.",

At any rate, I've never had Indian food quite like this is my life, so flavorful and impeccably prepared. I had the Vegetable Samosa, Okra Fries, Chicken Ruby and Roomali Roti - they were each fantastically delicious. I had a hard time picking a favorite when the waitress inquired - I ultimately said the okra, but could have selected any of them. I also had the Baileys Chai for dessert, which was a lovely, silky yet lightly spiced drink. The service was great too - she was very kind and made excellent recommendations. Had I come here at the beginning of my trip as opposed to the end, I may never have eaten anywhere else! Bravo!",

Step through the door and you leave London behind for a few hours - a heady mix of spice, sandalwood and sloooow scratchy jazz tunes really set the mood. Both the food and cocktails were exceptional, I'm a real fan of street food and sharing dishes so my friends and I ordered lots of smaller dishes to share which was perfect. Service was quite slow but we weren't in a rush, it's the sort of place that makes you feel nostalgic (must have been the jazz...or one too many Bombay Coladas!) and you just never want to leave - but alas, we had a train to catch! We came early evening so didn't have to queue very long but at busier times you can be queueing for ages which I can't be done with - no matter how good the food!",

Their signature Dal is too tomato-ee and does not bring out the flavours of the lentils at all. The service is in haste and sporadic.

We waited outside for 20-30 min (but were given a hot cup of chai), then moved inside to a bench, but weren't allowed to order a drink there. Waited another 20-30 min, then sent downstairs to the bar. Were there for about an hour and a bit, ordered 2 cocktails and then were finally moved upstairs for dinner. I have a feeling this is the standard pattern of how things are done at this restaurant - so expect that you'll have to spend money on at least 2 cocktails in the bar before you can have dinner and you won't feel annoyed about it!We had Keema pau, Chilli cheese toast to start (both were bordering on cold when they arrived). For mains we shared house daal, mattar paneer, murgh malai, kacchi lamb biryani, cheese naan.Can not fault any of the mains, arrived hot and well seasoned. Cheese nan was a bit too heavy perhaps (so much cheese!). Food prices are quite reasonable I think, but its the money you have to spend in the bar that really bumps up the bill. Not sure I like this system - not sure it happens at the Covent Garden branch.The decor and design of the restaurant is very special though - nice to have a chance to see the whole place, but not sure I'll be back in a hurry (definitely not when I'm in a rush to eat).",

New up and coming area and the restaurant has been open for about a month or two. My wife, who does not like spicy food, yet loves Dishoom, and I decided to split the following;-Dishoom Calamari. Crispy and a touch if sweetness. And the sauces they come with, mix excellent. -The Special-Nalli Nihari with Bheja (Of Course). A hearty stew. Leaves up to its billing. Amazing balance of taste and spice.-Dishoom Chicken tikka. This classic and beautifully done. Delicious-Cheese naan. Amazing, not much to say there.-Rice. Soft, steamed basmati rice. perfect complement. -Kingfisher beer. If they don't have the Dishoom IPA (which is excellent) this is your second best option to pair with your food.-Mango-fennel lassi. Just delicious. I always get this.-Blow horn spiced cider. My wife got this. Very crisp and refreshing.-Raita. Not only is helpful if you need to tame down the heat but its also delicious.Another amazing experience at Dishoom. Thanks also to our server Paul. He was awesome.",

It's a converted train station, with a big clock in the middle, lots of cool windows, and several stories. There's also burning incense in the air! Great vegetarian options as well. The curries are light and tasty, and the garlic naan is ultra garlicky-- just the way it should be! The staff is very nice too, gave us two free chai teas. Also had a dessert of chocolate pudding with cinnamon ice cream. It was so decadent and delicious! Love this place, and if I'm ever back in london, I will definitely be here again.",

We ordered 5 things for \u00a341, and the thing I liked the most was the Dishoom Calamari and the Black House Daal.This is by far one of the better spots in London. People in NYC recommend it.

And they also have their own IPA, brewed by Mondo Brewing. It's served bottled though. For starters, the vada pau was great. Even for a soft bun item, it had great texture because of the fried pea sprinkles and I slathered it with the cilantro chutney. More buns came via pau bhaji, which didn't seem to be much at first but it was dense, creamy, savory. Excellent savory app. As for some main dishes, I loved the awani lamb biryani, especially with the spices in it. The chicken ruby, another excellent dish. Creamy, buttery, melt in the mouth chicken. the garlic naan went perfectly with the whole meal.As for breakfast, we had chai and coffee and the big bombay breakfast, which had masala baked beans, half roasted tomato & mushrooms - both tangy. There was bacon and sausages. There was akuri, a type of scrambled egg. More buns came with this. The breakfast naan rolls were filling too. We had a sausage & egg one. Much saucier than I anticipated.",

We had the set menu, which included an assortment of nibbles and mains and sides, all of which were served in turn and in generous portions. Unfortunately, they ran out of one of the desserts, so we had only the three flavours of Indian style popsicle to choose from. Nonetheless, all was good and I quite enjoyed my mango popsicle. Service was excellent. They brought everything out promptly and went out of their way to assist us in various things, ranging extra drinks for select ones of us to helping charge my mobile in their office. The staff were friendly through to the end. A great different nice staff can make, especially for a part of c20 people. Ambience was also fab. Typical Dishoom style interior, but I appreciated how they paid attention to the details of maintaining the \"old\" and the history, amidst the modern infrastructure.",

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after having to wait over an hour at another location and couldn't pass up this opportunity. They send you inside to wait at the bar, which is nice. When we were ordering, they explained the menu. It was suggested that we get 3-4 dishes per person since it's quite small. We got 1 order of garlic naan, 1 order of rice, chicken ruby, mahi tikka, house black daal, dishoom calamari, roomali roti. (I don't/can't eat spicy foods so none of these dishes are spicy!) We didn't order a single thing that we disliked. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The only thing I wish they could do it tailor things to people's spice levels, but there were plenty of delicious dishes I had anyway! I highly suggest coming and waiting because it's worth the wait!!!PS: get the house black daal, it'll change your life :)",

I can't think of a single thing wrong with Dishoom. The service is grand, this particular location is stunning, and the flavors are everything that I crave.Be warned: the queue can be quite long. Two times I was in, we came right before the rush but alas, the third time, the line seemed to go on forever and didn't make it in. (They serve drinks outside for you, as a little teaser to the excellence inside.)During dinner, we sat at the bar on the main level and felt right where I needed to be. This place is beautiful and though I haven't been to Mumbai, I'd like to think that this is how it must look. Sigh. I started with their take on an Old Fashioned. Don't know why I'm drinking these, they're a little sweet for my taste, but the presentation here is sure delightful: served in a small apothecary-like bottle with the ice on the side, it wasn't very strong but that was fine by me.The dinner menu looked incredible but we didn't want to overdo it. We had the Murgh Malai, chicken marinated overnight in garlic and other tastiness. Yum! The roti is thin and made a great spoon to sup the House Black Daal (black lentils) and wooosh it was delicious! To keep things light, we also had the Paneer and Mango salad. The crispy shallot crumbs elevated the salad. Breakfast at Dishoom. Oh dear. I didn't want to leave. This time we sat on the top floor. It was early so it was slower than usual. My guy ordered the chai while I opted for the fresh-squeezed Pineapple, lime, and black pepper juice. It was so very good and not as acidic as it sounds. We also enjoyed the Bun Maska, which was like a toasted sweet roll with a thick layer of BUTTER inside. Its sole purpose in life is to be dunked into the side of Chai tea that came with it. Ooooooh The Bombay Omelet was beautiful, but was a little underwhelmed by the flavor. I ended up using the ketchup served on the side. So while you can pass on the omelet, do not miss the Kejriwal. Two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. Eggs in London are gorgeous, bright orange, and everywhere I eat, they're cooked to flowing yolk perfection. Theirs is no exception. For this dish, I laughed the ketchup right off the plate. Ugh. I want to go back. We don't have anything remotely like this at home. For a great atmosphere, service, food, and overall vibe, make Dishoom your next stop.",

The samosas were flavorful but I would have preferred a bit more spice (they were heavy on cinnamon and nutmeg). The okra was amazing and I typically hate okra. The garlic naan left a lot to be desired. It would have been better paired with a more flavorful rita. The service was the best part. Our server went out of her way to be accommodating and sweet. We went later in the evening after he dinner rush and she never made us feel like we had to hurry and she still had People sing happy birthday to me at the end of our meal. My recommendation is to call and determine how long the wait is before going. You'll wait for hours if you aren't prepared.",

As far as food goes, here are my (veg) highlights:Okra friesBlack daalChole bhatura (amazing)The price point is great, and they're very accommodating about food allergies - I brought a gluten free person here and the staff was very helpful. In general the service is excellent.",

I've gone! I would like to say a few things:1/ The food was very good. Like high quality stuff.2/ If you gave to me in a blindfold, tbh I'm not sure how to tell the difference between good and pretty good indian food and so I'm developing a palette which is why we're not at 5 stars yet.3/ There's always a massive line, but i think* you can make a reservation so I'm not sure why anyone waits in the line?4/ Favorite dish was the lentil dal on top of a bit of rice.5/ They also have really cute drinks like the chai punch. Comes in a cute 'peg' (glass bottle) which you pour out onto some solid ice cubes which gives it a look of whiskey (which is part of it).",

Sunday came and my gosh, this was some of the best Indian food I've eaten around the world! I've been to India and this food was amazing. Get the vegetable samosas, okra fries, naan and the chicken tikka were great. Looking forward to the next visit to London!",

We really liked the waythe place is all laid out. Outdoor seating options are also available, but wastoo cold for our March visit to try. Note that this place can really get busy,so it's better if you have a reservation.As for our lunch visit here's what we tried:-- Far Far for starters. A crunchy, salty type of cracklings...really good!-- Dishoom Chicken Tikka...this is pure awesomeness-- Adwahi Lamb (Biryani)...flavorful and very tender-- Garlic Naan...soft and tasty-- Gadbad Mitha...its like mixed bowl of sugar goodnessThis place is a MUST visit if ever in the area.

The table service here was wonderful and, although busy, the staff were very attentive and friendly.When we were seated, the three of us all ordered a side, main and naan to be shared between us. The flavours were phenomenal and it's some of the best Indian food I've had in a restaurant. Amazing food, flawless service and a wonderful ambience.

Decor around the restaurant was comprised of a lot of salvaged/found goods, which gave the place a really \"worn-in\" and comfy feel, despite being a new and pretty large restaurant. The long bar was beautiful -- I would have loved to come back for a few drinks if I had more time.Seems like everyone rages about the brunch so might recommend that instead of dinner.",

We came for breakfast on a Sunday at 9:45am so thankfully there wasn't a queue! We opted for the famous bacon and egg naan roll and were not in the slightest bit disappointed. The combination of tastes were delicious! We've tried coming in the evenings but the thought of queueing for 2 hours is just ludicrous. So we got a take out instead and whilst I still think the dinner prices are a little over-priced, I'd definitely eat here again.",

We ordered a variety of appetizers and main courses to split between three people. All of it was top notch Indian food, making coming back to the States even that much harder.What really sold me overall was their incredible drink menu from the permit room. I got a gin cocktail that was absolutely to die for although I couldn't find the name of it on their website. Would absolutely make this a must-stop location for anyone looking for some authentic and delicious Indian food.",

The queue managers are nice, though, and have taster drinks for people outside. At the bar downstairs, the waiter was friendly and knowledgable and made some tasty cocktails in front of us. When we finally got to eat (after 2 hours), we were famished. The black lentil daal and gunpowder potatoes were total winners, though. The interior, as with other Dishooms, is interesting and atmospheric. Split level, each section feels small and intimate, even though the whole restaurant itself is bigger than average.",

I wouldn't say the best *literally* but that's a sliding scale. You were definitely a solid second.If this review was on food alone, you would have got a five star.Alas.It is not. Instead your review includes service. Service particularly from a lady called Natalie. This is where things go awry.I have one rule when I'm eating anywhere. In fact, make that two rules. First being 'Even if it does look like a hipster would have an orgasm when they walked in, don't let that mar your judgement'. I didn't allow that to sway me. Joss sticks and all. I held my resolve.Joss sticks. In a restaurant. Right by the open kitchen.Second rule is, never allow a server to say 'you can't have that, other people on the table have ordered it'. Oh Natalie. Mistake number one. When I come to your restaurant in a group of eight. Not all of us are going to buy into your 'a dish is for the table, not for you' attitude. Oh no. If I order a lamb balti, that lamb balti is MINE. Not the table's. MINE.In the words of his holyness Joey Tribbiani: 'Joey doesn't share food'. No Natalie. He doesn't, and neither do I.When a table of eight has ordered three bowls of Black House Daal, and try to order a fourth. We don't care that you would never normally allow a table of six to order two between them. We'll order what we want.Your judgemental comments and attitude did nothing to make us like you. It only served to put us off coming back again.Once you'd seen that we had infact consumed all the Daal that we ordered. You comments of 'well, I assure you that has never happened before' also did nothing to warm us.The final straw in your incompetence was when, after we had paid all of our bill, including a larger than due 15% tip you proceeded to tell us that we had not even paid the base amount without service charge.Now don't get me wrong. You made an honest mistake. Maths off the cuff can be hard. Anyone could have made the mistake. The tone of, and judgemental nature 'Eeeer, excuse me. You're 60p short of the minimum'. Only disappointed us further. Had you checked your maths, you would have found your mistake.We left thoroughly disappointed, and will not be returning. This place gets a two solely for the food. I'd have knocked off another star and given it a one because of you, Natalie, but I'm not that rude. I recommend you avoid.I haven't even covered the offers of waters and snacks whilst we chose our food - all of which were charged for with no discussion of price. The 'bottle of water for the table' became three bottles of water for the table as they emptied one, brought over another and charged us for them.",

No expense was spared, and you really do feel like your stepping into a new environment when you enter here. There are details in every thing, a great place to relax and soak in some inspiration.The breakfast menu was very affordable, most items between 6 to 10 pounds. I ordered 2 eggs on toast, coated in chilli cheese. This was called the kejriwal. Cooked to perfection, not what I would consider to be spicy when it comes to chilli infusions. The eggs were fresh, with a runny yoke and plenty of cheese to bring it all together. This dish was served with a bit of Heinz ketchup, which I would recommend be changed for something more fresh and original. The chai tea was fantastic, and was refilled a couple of times by a friendly server. Highly recommend this restaurant for an affordable breakfast, or a dynamite dinner.",

We brought our whole team from work here for a celebratory breakfast. A lot of the team had an Indian take on a bacon butty using nan breads and mango chutney. I went for a breakfast curry. I loved the restaurant's commitment to helping the vulnerable as each meal you eat there helps a vulnerable child in the UK to receive a nutritious lunch or breakfast.

The romali roti and paneer masala is delicious and a good combination. The waiter also recommended one of their house cocktails which was really good and refreshing.

And now that my flat is right around the corner, I think I'll be coming here pretty often Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. I'm a big fan of the Keema per eedu, which is basically chicken liver under two fried eggs. The naan roll is the most popular menu item and and sure does look delicious. Lassi is good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.For lunch I ordered the Ruby Chicken and gunpowder potatoes. The Ruby Chicken is best enjoyed with some rice. The potatoes are the real deal! So much flavor with all the herbs and spices. Check back with me in 2 months and I think I'll have the whole menu sampled by then ;)",

This place only takes reservations for parties of 6 or more.It was our first time at Dishoom and we were quite overwhelmed with their extensive menu. The menu was explained to us twice, and they were really patient with our confused selves lol. After explaining that each person should order 2-3 dishes, we opted for the bhel and prawn kaliwada for starters. For the main dishes, we got the murgh malai (chicken thighs) and lamb kebab to share with their signature black daal. We also ordered the garlic naan and I got the kala khatta sharbat drink. This may seem like a lot of food but the portion sizes are pretty small.The drink had hints of chili but was still incredibly refreshing and sweet! We didn't realize the garlic naan was only 2 half pieces, so we ordered a bowl of basmati rice to share. Next time, I'd rather skip the naan and order just rice. There isn't enough naan to last the meal and the amount you're getting isn't worth the price. One bowl of rice was plenty to share for 2 people.The prawn kaliwada was good - it came with a sweet dipping sauce which I wasn't a fan of. The shrimp itself was flavorful and spicy. The bhel was so complex in flavor and texture. And the colors were pretty too! Definitely my favorite appetizer - it was light, refreshing and delicious!The grilled dishes each came with about 6-7 pieces of meat about the size of ping pong balls. They were dressed with cilantro and a side cup of onions, cucumbers and more cilantro! The lamb kebab was very good and extremely flavorful - it was my boyfriend's favorite but it was a little too dry for me. The murgh malai was THE BOMB. Extremely tender and flavorful, and the green cilantro dipping sauce made it even better! The black daal was delicious, I understand why it's a house favorite. Everything here seems very affordable but keep in mind, the dishes are small. Each person is meant to order multiple dishes for sharing, which can add up.Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of their menu!Note: super cool ambience! The restaurant used to be an old rail yard for shipping and packing goods. The restaurant has a unique variety of furniture and there are incense everywhere! They also sell their own vinyl...",

    "text": "When in London, do what the desis do, right?! Cannot rave enough about this place! In the 4 days we spent in London, we made it here 3 times. Sadly never for the bottomless chai brunch, but mostly late night dinners. The Kings cross location is way bigger than the downtown location (which we went to, but didn't eat at given the insane wait). This location has several different nooks and crannies, differnt seating styles - very reminiscent of \u00a01980's Kolkatta in my opinion. The place is a warehouse turned into a restaurant and there is a cool little story on their menu. I loved everything about the decor - the office style chairs, the loungers, quirky hand wash sink, family pictures up on the walls - very very cool.Now for the food. Both Anurag and I had our favorites. For me, it was the vada pao, which I ate every time I made it here. The bread to filling ratio was just perfect, the sauce on the side was delicious. Any one who knows me, knows I cannot handle spice - but I kid you not, I poured ALL the ghati masala (super spicy) on my vada pao, along with the spicy sauce and devoured it all. I had tears in my eyes along the way and my tongue was numb, but it was just amazingly delicious, washed down with a generous swig of king fisher. Anurag tried the keema pao and deemed it delicious too. His all time favorite though - the butter chicken (murgh malai) - succulent pieces of chicken, velvety smooth gravy, sopped up with traditional roomali roti. He was so in love with the dish, you could see his eyes light up every time he took a bite, haha!The chicken biryani was another delicious dish - it made for an excellent jet lagged yet hung over meal for my husband :) We also tried the bhel - it was okay, but not at the same level as the dishes above. The paneer kathi roll was also delish - \u00a0made for a great back \"open the boot and chill\" kinda snack as we drove down to Dorset the next day. Perfect balance of spices - excellent road side snack :)|Definitely recommend coming here - there is a bit of something for everyone!",

You're definitely paying for quality here.On a Monday night, the restaurant was extremely packed so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our table. As we were waiting to get inside, the hosts graciously offered some chai that really warmed us up. LOVED THIS! It's the small things that really make the experience even when we hadn't sat down to eat yet.Before being seated, we hung out at their bar downstairs and ordered drinks while waiting. My Kalamansi Smash was a fantastic fusion of lime and vodka with this Filipino fruit. Once we were ready to be seated, our servers took us to our table and explained how ordering would work. They recommended that we each order a curry of some sort, some naan, and perhaps some chicken and lamb for the table. We did just that and my goodness, everything that we tasted was delicious! The curries were definitely hearty enough to fill one person and the lamb kebabs were fire. I wish that we received more naan for the price but it was still good for what it's worth.Overall, we had a great time dining at Dishoom and would come back here in a heartbeat. Note that they add an \"optional\" 12.5% service charge which is awkward to refuse, but completely up to you if you choose to opt out. Be sure to make it clear at the beginning.",

I visited for breakfast so there wasn't much of a crowd like the lines I saw at the more touristy Covent Garden location. The bar area had a lounge where you can enjoy a coffee or a stiff drink along with your breakfast. I just sat at the bar which had a lot of hustle and bustle with the \u00a0busy staff. My server was really nice.The vibe and menu reminded me of Pondicheri's in Houston and NYC. Prices were not too high given the upscale nature of the place. I ordered the Kejriwal which were two eggs over chile cheese toast. It was good and the colours were striking with the orange egg yolks but the bread was stiff and hard to cut with a butter knife. I was also surprised to find not a hint of spice given the chile in the toast. My breakfast lassi was also surprisingly less sweet than I expected with the dominant taste of oats and cardamom in the drink. Overall, the flavours of the food and drink were more subtle than something I can get at Pondicheri and may reflect British palates. I would come here again to explore the lunch/dinner menu though.",

It was busy, but we were seating immediately upon arrival. \u00a0We ordered several plates, but the two standouts for us were the cheese naan and the pau bhaji. The service was great. Our waiter even tracked us down after the meal to give us the bags we'd accidentally left under the table. We were all in food comas and not thinking clearly.I usually skip the mid-day beer, but we were on vacation and they had an IPA that was brewed specially for Dishoom.

The restaurant is huge inside with 4 floors of service! No joke!!! And every nook & cranny is lovingly decorated and designed to stay true to the fusion of elevated vintage \"travel/goods exchange station\" and India (like an authentic washing station, photos, coloring, etc.) with written signage in both English and Hindi. I've been lucky enough to have visited India and this felt so familiar and comforting. The service was impeccable and our server Falhid (spelling?) was so accommodating and informative. We were dressed super casual and obviously not locals but were treated like royalty. The food was insanely authentic and delicious with quality infused into each dish and bite. We arrived just after breakfast service but they brought us a serving of Bun Maska upon seeing our disappointment and we were so grateful. The bread was so fresh and the chai warmed the soul. We also had some colorful Indian snacks brought complimentary, and we ordered Muttar Paneer (wife's favorite!), Chicken Tikka Roll (like kathi roll), and bowl of greens with plain biryani. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Lucky and unsurprisingly they have 5 more locations!!!!PS: check out the bar downstairs and the restrooms! Even they are an experience. So special!",

    "text": "I freakin love Indian food in London. There's no place like it other than possibly India itself. It just tastes substantially better, with bursts of flavor. Dishoom is no different. It is a very popular restaurant in London with multiple locations. There is always a queue and the best possible way to get in without waiting is to make a reservation.I made a res at the King's Cross location. The space is bustling, with an amazing bar downstairs and seating both floor level and upstairs. Upon arrival, there was already a queue and I had made res for a lunch hour (although I did hear that their breakfast is pretty darn good). The menu is a little extensive, but innovative than the typical Indian food you would get in LA. The table was just big enough to accommodate all the food we had ordered, so we were lucky.  OKRA FRIES (\u00a34.20). Fine Lady's Fingers for the Fingers. I wasn't the biggest fan of these. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I'm just not a fan of okra. Though the slimey layer was almost non-transparent, I could still taste it. But, if you like okra, you'll love this. \u00a0VEGETABLE SAMOSAS (\u00a33.50). Fine Filo Pastry, Pea and Potato Filling Warmly Spiced with Cinnamon and Cloves. These were delicious. It was light and airy and wasn't heavy. I'm always a fan of samosas and they're one of my favorite appetizers. If you want something on the lighter end that isn't too heavy, get these! \u00a0HOUSE BLACK DAAL (\u00a35.90). A Dishoom Signature Dish-Dark, Rich, Deeply Flavoured. It is Cooked Over 24 hours for Extra Harmony. This was absolutely delicious. I didn't know what to expect. We ordered a medium spice level which was perfect. It went so well with the biryani. I definitely recommend getting this dish. \u00a0 JACKFRUIT BIRYANI (\u00a38.90). Delicious, Savoury Jackfruit and Delicately Saffron'd Rice, Patted and Cooked with Mint, Coriander, and Sultanas. I loved this dish. It's different than the usual biryani you get at other restaurants. There was so much flavor and surprisingly, the jackfruit tasted like there was meat in it. It's a great dish for the vegetarian and awesome with curry. \u00a0GUNPOWDER POTATOES (\u00a36.50). The seduction is in the Tumble. Potatoes with Brown Skins, Smoky-Grilled, Broken Apart, Tossed with Butter, Crushed Aromatic Seeds and Green Herbs. This is one of the most popular dishes at Dishoom. I thought it was good but not amazing. I mean, they're potatoes and I'd actually rather eat something that consists of curry. If you love potatoes though, you would enjoy these. \u00a0MY FAVORITE DISH. CHICKEN RUBY (\u00a39.50). A Good and Proper Curry Redolent with Spice and Flavour, Tender Chicken in a rich silky 'makhani'sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. I love freakin curry and this is by far, one of the best ones. It's similar to a tikka masala but better than what you would get anywhere in the States. It's rich and creamy and if you love tikka masala, you definitely should get this. \u00a0SPICY LAMB CHOPS (\u00a311.90). They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jiggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Blackened by the Grill, but Juicy inside. I thought these were good but I've had better at Tayyabs. The chops had a lot of flavor, and it was grilled nicely, but it wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Regardless though, I would still order it. \u00a0HOUSE CHAI (\u00a32.50). All things nice: warming comfort and satisfying spice. Made in the proper way. All who have tried it are swearing by it. This was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and had all the right spices. If you're a chai drinker, you'd love this warm drink. \u00a0Overall, I loved Dishoom. For Indian food with a twist, this is the place to go. It's not super traditional, but they do have traditional dishes. The space is amazing and the service was pretty good. The waiter was insisting I visit again the next morning, but I couldn't. I wish I did since their breakfast menu looked amazing and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes and it's a great place for a get together. If you're ever in London, hit up this spot. for other reviews, check out thefoodseeker dot com",

    "text": "Whether you're a local or a tourist, there's no way you wouldn't have heard of Dishoom - because it's one of the best places to have Indian food in London. Dishoom is widely known for the thoughtfully curated modern Indian cuisine and the interior design of its restaurants.Unfortunately they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people and the wait can be long but not to fret, all locations have a bar area inside for those who are waiting for a table to grab some drinks first. Try the Calaba Colada, it's like a pina colada with a Bombay twist and trust me, the 45 minute wait won't feel long at all.Shortly after being seated, you'll get a pretty extensive menu printed on a double sided A3 paper. I'll make this easy for you - for a classic curry, what you should try is the Chicken Ruby. This is rich and flavorful, and the chicken is incredibly tender. You'll get a ton of curry sauce so help yourself to some slow cooked and aromatic biryani. I recommend either the Awadhi Lamb Biryani or the Jackfruit Biryani. I'm a huge fan of both and it's great for sharing. For sides, I like the Gunpowder Potatoes - they're smokey and aromatic with a slight kick to your taste buds. For those who can't pass on paneer at an Indian restaurant, the Mattar Paneer is the way to go. It's rich and flavorful, you can't go wrong with this. And if you find that you have a ton of extra sauce left, a garlic naan or the handkerchief-thin roti is great for this. \u00a0On their menu, you'll also find the specials which are seasonal and usually great for big groups. I got to try the pulled lamb shank on the bone once and it was super tender, spicey and delicious! I highly recommend checking out Dishoom, it definitely lives up to the hype. And don't forget to ask for some of their complimentary chutney!",

And the vibe is just so cool. I've been here a few times, usually getting the chole bhatura with an extra garlic naan and it is always good. The brunch is good as well - though a much more limited offering, it is all delicious. The masala beans offer a spicy twist on typical English breakfast beans. Don't miss out on the house chai - it's what keeps bringing us back. All in all, it's a great place for locals as well as to bring visitors to London. I will undoubtedly be back again.",

    "text": "A bit of background for you, I grew up in Leicestershire and have always found curries in London and Hertfordshire too sweet. I'm hardly a connoisseur but know what flavours I like.The first time I came the queue outside was an hour long so I walked away, vowing to return earlier next time. I'm so pleased I \u00a0did because Dishoom has quickly become my go-to restaurant when I'm near Kings Cross. I've been twice since, once with a friend and then with my dad - who said this was \"the best Indian he'd ever had in London, probably the best Indian EVER!\"The experience begins from the moment you join the inevitable queue outside. They offer you a drink (mint tea or a spirit I seem to remember) which I think is a very kind gesture. You hopefully go inside quite quickly to sit in the bar downstairs. The cocktail list seems to cater for all tastes - strong shorts or sweet and fruity options. My only criticism come from the trip with my dad when the menu had at least 3 drinks listed that they no longer offered.Once the go upstairs to the dining room you'll realise how nice and helpful the staff really; offering recommendations of their favourite or most popular dishes. I have over ordered on both occasions but they generously boxed up the remaining food into individual pots so I could take it home. I rate the Prawn Koliwada, Lamb Biryani and Ruby Murray but still have lots of the menu to work my way through.",

    "text": "We went to Dishoom on Saturday morning for brunch. Having been to their Covent Garden branch for NYE dinner some time back, I had decent expectations.The decor, the setting etc are supposed to take you back to Bombay. The hallmarks are high roofs with lights and fans hanging, wooden furniture that give you an impression of time having passed by and an atmosphere that whilst looking busy, lets you sit back and relax. Dishoom ticked all these boxes. Now, because we went at breakfast/brunch time, we got the breakfast menu.Going to the food, we got two bacon rolls with naan, which to me, is the best of both worlds. Delicious bacon sandwich, pimped up to an Indian level with naan and some tasty chutney. We also got a fire toast, which was, toast with some spicy chutney. We also got a maska bun (bun with butter) to share. There was the option of bottomless house chai, which some of us went for. For me the biggest delight was South Indian coffee from the Coorg district of Karnataka! I go giddy for Coorg coffee, so yes, that was brilliant. The food tasted great, the coffee was exceptional and the house chai, with the bottomless option was also a winner. However, there were drawbacks, significant ones, which take the experience down to a 3 star.Now, the problem was that if you are a vegetarian, who does't even eat egg, you have no options. You can either opt for the fire toast or go for an egg roll (similar to the bacon roll) without the egg. This, by far was the biggest disappointment. The other big factor was the congestion. The tables were stacked too close to one another, which meant that if you lean back you make unnecessary contact with the person behind you, especially if you're both big blokes. In a traditional Bombay Irani cafe, the tables aren't that close that you lose a sense of privacy.But having said all this, the staff were friendly and courteous, which is an asset to this industry.If I did go back to Dishoom, it definitely will not be for their brunch/breakfast, but perhaps for a proper meal.",

It has that classic home food/ street food foundation but does it in modern, fun and classy ways. The restaurant just is so amazing inside. It plays on its location as a former railway depot and has made it Indian railway style...it's just such a great place to sit and eat with friends as there's so much cool stuff to look at while you eatThe food is outstanding : the house daal, pao bhaji, chicken biryani and lamb chops are world classHonestly if u want REAL Indian food go here!! This is not a curry house...its quality and class Indian food for people who know what Indian food from the subcontinent really is!",

It is just very slick from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.The first thing that struck me was the size of the restaurant. It's huge and despite being split over three levels it somehow manages to be intimate at in spite of the space. Dishoom has received so many plaudits and accolades - and I can easily see why - but it's extremely modest to be described as a 'Bombay style cafe', as it's much more than that. Even the breakfast menu is full of Bombay flavours - one of the most unique breakfast menus in London. I went for the sausage and egg naan roll. It's unlike any sausage and egg roll you'll ever eat - in a very good way. Others in our party went for the acclaimed bacon naan roll and someone also chomped on the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli toast). After this experience, I'll definitely be coming back for dinner. And breakfast, again.",

    "text": "The stars are kind of a giveaway, so yes: this place is great. I would be remiss if I did not note that there were a few initial red flags, however.First: it's both huge and nicely decorated. This, perversely, worried me. Gilgamesh in Camden is huge; it's been years since I've been, but it was a hot mess of a restaurant, with orders mixed up, confusing portion sizes, swarms of confused staff, and cryptic pricing. The money had all gone on the decor and a very decent bar staff, but eating felt like you'd done very badly in an exam you expected to ace. Second: when we were seated, the waiter asked if I'd been to Dishoom before, and then explained the 'concept' to me. This worried me too. In a culinary context I am rarely keen on concepts that require explanation. But in this instance the concept was that we were expected to share, that it was a small-plates kind of deal, and that things would arrive when they were ready and not as part of a traditional starter/main framework; so, fine. This isn't Gilgamesh, where the concept was that they did expensive food very averagely from a bewildering variety of Asian cultures, so that's fine. (I'm still bitter about it, yes.)The worries melted away when the food came. Lamb samosas and some calamari - a signature dish, according to the waiter - came first. The samosas were pretty good; the calamari was excellent, with a light salty batter and a sweet, acidic sauce - tamarind? Pomegranate? Something like that. I would come back for the calamari alone. Seekh kebabs and mahi tikka were next, with some excellent cucumber raita and crispy, fresh naan bread. \u00a0Everything is really interestingly spiced; nothing's overpowering, or even very hot, but it's complex. The signature black dahl is brilliant, but there's equal attention to detail in the complimentary relishes (mint and coriander, red and green chilli, and something I missed because I'm a bit deaf.) I don't know what they put in the 'Gunpowder potatoes' - I assume it wasn't gunpowder - but they were delicious and fragrant.This all felt like pretty good value for thirty quid a head (including an OK cocktail and a nice bottle of pale ale.) I've eaten at pricier Indian restaurants like Tamarind and the Cinnamon Club and not had nearly as nice a time. The one drawback really is that it's very popular. When we arrived at lunchtime on a Saturday it was packed, and people (ourselves included) were queuing outside for quite some time. Inside it's noisy and occasionally hard to catch the waiters' eyes when they're running around making sure the food gets out to the tables hot off the stove (which they do brilliantly, but it's difficult to make sure this works in an it-comes-as-it's-ready environment. Or at least at Gilgamesh, anyway.) Definitely go. Book in advance if you can. I'm interested to go for breakfast - served until 12 - which looks like it'd be great, going by the menu.",

    "text": "To get to dishoom, you walk though the fountains on granary square, along canals and through crowds of students from St martins. It's a beautiful location, which adds to the feeling that dishoom is out of the ordinary. A feeling that continues when you get inside and experience their drinks, service and food.The door staff are polite and friendly, but be prepared for a long wait in the evening. Booking a table isn't available unless you are a group of 6+. We started out at dishoom at 3pm though on a Saturday and we got a table for cocktails in their bar below. There were eight of us and we decided to stay and eat upstairs later on. The table took an hour of so, but it's not really a problem when you are waiting in such nice surroundings. The interior design of the place is exquisitely executed. Signs are in English and Nepali, antique pictures from Nepal and India hang from the Jade coloured walls. A colonial vintage feel runs through dishoom's three floors, yet it never feels antiquated and modern twists breath vitality into the place. As you head downstairs to the 'the permit room' bar, their is a cosy atmosphere. The colonial feel continues, with teak furniture and Tiffany lamps. We started with some sumptuous cocktails. I had the Tanchoix fix. This is a delicate blend of mandarin, peppers and aged gin. The cocktails are quite pricey though at \u00a39 for a small one and \u00a318 for a large. Unfortunately not something we could have sustained. We then found that there was a great punch whose recipe dates back to the 1600's. It uses tea, arak, limes and jaggery. It is served in a cute vintage punch bowl with copper cups for all. There were 8 of us and the punch served us with a glass and a half each per bowl. This was a bit of a bargain, as each bowl was \u00a329 each. We went through six bowl and were quite merry!We ate upstairs and chose to get a number of dishes and share. The food is like the decor and uses the traditional flavours of South Asia whilst adding modern twists and European flavours into the mix. Particularly exceptional was the black dhaal main course, the paneer roll (which comes with a divine mint sauce) and the paper thin roti. This is not your traditional British Nepali/Indian takeaway usual... You won't find a greasy rogan josh or a bland korma on here. Instead Chili cheese toast, lamb on the bone curry (with or without lamb brain) and the Bombay dish of pau bhaji set your tastebuds alight and help to soak up the punch. After 7 hour there (not a joke) we were throughly drunk, thoroughly full and thoroughly glad to have chosen dishoom. And those of us who didn't have an individual cocktail at the beginning the whole experience cost \u00a335. You can't say fairer than that!",

    "text": "Cool.Dishoom is one of those really hot restaurants (with multiple locations) in London currently that I didn't think I'd end up going to, but actually ended up going to. Service was mostly disingenuously friendly at first, especially after some initial confusion of whether or not it was permissible to order food at the bar. (The hostess had suggested it wasn't.) The bartender seemed cheerfully annoyed when we were not ready to order within 5 seconds of sitting down, as if he expected us to fire away our order despite lack of introduction to anything on the menu, which took some time to sift through. Not even halfway through our meal, where the dude had spent most of his energy avoiding eye-contact and chatting with other servers, he decided it was finally acceptable to desert us all-together, which was most fortunate because a better server took over. Enough about service, let's cut to the food --There were some good things at Dishoom. The standout was the \"ruby chicken,\" with a silky red sauce that you just want to leave nothing behind of by burying a piece of naan into, again and again. And then there were some forgettable things, like how a lassi is still just a lassi, which leaves no surprises. Overall, I thought the fare at Dishoom had some nice spices and flavoring going on. It was also fun to have the chance to taste many different, interesting sauces. Harsher criticism includes a mild irritation against servers who seem to have gotten caught up in their own personal aesthetics, putting on glassy smiles that match the shiny restaurant interior, which lest we forget, is still an imitation of the real thing at best. Aw look, I can be a douchebag for fun too.",

Open at 9am weekends, Dishoom's expansive space is the holy grail of brunch in Kings Cross. \u00a0Our group of 3 tried almost all offerings on the menu, I can heartily vouch for: KEEMA PER EEDU: A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicatemorsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs andsali crisp-chips. Served with pau. \u00a37.90. (SO RICH and delicious)HOUSE GRANOLA: A Dishoom recipe, handmade with oats, seeds, cashews, almonds, pistachios and cinnamon, toasted in butter and honey. Served with fresh fruits,Kerala-vanilla yoghurt and Buckinghamshire honey. \u00a35.20 (Your friends will say they'll share but they won't, everyone get their own granola -- you'll thank me!) The service was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. Flawless. It was an exceptional brunch, so much so that I've convinced my friends to go back next weekend. Pro tip: if you think you've had real chai...wait til you've tasted the glory of Dishoom's offering. It is comfort in a glass. I order a single espresso with it for a little kick, but they keep the chai coming (free of charge!) after you finished a glass. Pair with the Musaka bun (buttered bun) for dipping, and holy wow you've got yourself a winning breakfast treat.",

Of all of them, I would recommend any, though the veg korma was not as mindblowing.Also they make great cocktails. Luckily (or semi-unluckily) the line (queue) was so long you'll have a chance to try a few before your meal. The first part of the line takes place outside. In the late fall chill, this kind of sucks but they do ply you with free sherry, mint tea and chai. The second part of the line is in the downstairs bar where you'll be temporarily seated and can order drinks and two snack options. Of the two, get the banana chips. The various chutneys are excellent.Once you're actually seated the good comes out quick too.

No wonder they have expanded to include many other locations across the city. It was a somewhat lengthy, but fun experience. They have worked out the waiting experience pretty well. You will be served complimentary drinks while you queue to get in. My aunt is from a Zoroastrian family and told me that Dishoom is nostalgically accurate, right down to details like the chairs and the bathrooms. There are some fusions like the Indian Pimms cup, which uses ginger beer and is studded with pomegranate seeds. VERY tasty cuisine and a lively scene. Highly recommended.",

Last time we were there for a company lunch and they were able to serve us very quickly and we ordered a bunch of small plates which were easy to share and everyone had something they liked (actually we liked everything..). Have yet to try something there that I haven't liked. There is a great variety if you don't like spicy food, or are a picky eater..there is really something there for everybody. the restaurant itself is decorated really well and you can tell the owner and staff really put their heart into running the company and it is very authentic. Would definitely recommend for any kind of event (family dinner, date, company lunch, etc.). I would suggest making a reservation if possible since it does book up!!",

    "text": "Dishoom is special...like...really special. Sorry for the novel of a review but it's worth every word. Dishoom is so special that I came here twice in the last week that I lived in London...it's so special that eating a very early lunch here was the very last thing I did before getting on the tube to Heathrow. I'm gonna attempt to break down what makes this place so spectacular. First of all, the vibe of this space is very special. It's large and light with high ceilings and comfortable seating on the entry level. Both times I have visited we stayed on the ground level, but I poked my head upstairs and it's beautiful. Downstairs they have a little lounge-ey bar. The owners have done a masterful job, updating this building while still hanging on to the old school industrial feel to it. The service on my first visit was flawless. The waitress broke down the menu for us and helped us to figure out exactly what to order to suit out preferences. She was very thorough in asking about food allergies and preferred spice levels. Also, she was clearly passionate and informed about the food. It didn't feel like she was trying to up sell us, but instead to make sure we were getting the right items that would be ideal for sharing. On my second visit, the staff was less amazing but I chalked that up to our early visit and the fact that we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't ask for a menu walk through. Again, I found out waiter to be helpful, though somewhat less attentive. The food here is show stopping. Easily the best Indian food I've had in my life and possibly the best meals I've eaten in London. I adored every bite of every item we ordered. You must try the black daal. It's spectacular. Rich and savory and outstanding. The calamari was definitely a stand out (in a sweet and sour fruity sauce). The lamb kebab and chicken tikka were juicy and delicious and perfectly spiced. The lamb samosas were crispy and well flavored (though I wish there were more than 2 in an order). The gunpowder potatoes are tasty and savory and a cheap side dish to go with all of the other more flavorsome dishes. The house special lamb stew was outstanding. Like my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. Oh my god. Also the naan (we tried all four kinds) are all fabulous. The cocktails and even the nonalcoholic drinks all looked incredibly tempting. My friend and I split a pitcher of Bombay pimms and it was fabulous and refreshing.The one caveat of this place is its crazy business. Make sure you book a table if you can or be prepared to wait. But really. It's like so worth it. I am heartbroken to have moved so far away from this magical restaurant. Please go there for me. Show me the pictures. I will cry from jealousy but it will be worth it. Go. Now. Right now.",

Downstairs is more lounge like and the upstairs is open and perfect for a lunch break .The food is the star here and I can't wait to go back on my next trip to London .

    "text": "We have been hearing phenomenal reviews about Dishoom from friends, and locals while visiting London, and decided to give it a go on Wednesday night. \u00a0Since we are staying near St. Pancras Station, we opted for the location in Kings Cross. \u00a0No reservations could be made for small parties so we just ventured out around 8 hoping to avoid any huge lines. \u00a0Unfortunately, this was not the case and we were promptly greeted with a line with a queue time of \u00a01 hour. \u00a0This did not phase us or persuade us to leave due to the fact that these people were gathered here for a reason and we were ready to find out what that was. \u00a0As we waited in line, we were offered a water, hot mint tea or a sherry. \u00a0Since it was a little chilly, I opted for the hot mint tea. \u00a0After our complimentary drink in line, we had the option presented to us to sit at the bar and eat which we gladly accepted. \u00a0The atmosphere is a cozy, dim lit, Mombay-style setting. \u00a0Our bartender/waitress (Adele) was more than helpful when deciding on items to choose from very friendly during our visit. We ordered the Calamari and some vegetable samosas to start off with and they were instantly devoured. \u00a0Some of the best Calamari I have had while visiting London. \u00a0For the main course, we ordered the following: Mattar Paneer, Gunpowder Potatoes, Cheese Naan, Dishoom Slaw, and a side of rice. \u00a0EVERYTHING was superb. \u00a0It was hard not to keep ordering but this much food between 2 people was more than enough. \u00a0The food comes out quickly after placing the order so if I were to switch it up next time, I would stagger my orders a few more minutes in between dishes. \u00a0I can't wait to try the breakfast menu on my next visit. \u00a0It looks just as good and the Bloody Mary's look insane.",

Turning up to their Kings Cross branch and seeing a line of fewer than 5 people, we decided to wait in line. We got the customary \"It might take 30min, but we doubt it\" and fewer than 10 minutes later we were seated. The decor is amazing; if I could buy a home like it, I would. It does however feel quite colonial. But has a great charm to it (if you get a chance, check out the toilets!) The food was also awesome, and kudos to them for having both a gluten free, and a dairy free version of their menu. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "When I visited London last Fall, we tried to get into three different Dishoom locations, only to find unbearably long queues, so it's been at the top of my suggestion list since I got back to London in June. Finally, today was the day I got to experience the bacon and egg naan that I'd been hearing about, but first, let me say how beautiful this location is. Unassuming from the outside, inside you're transported back in time to British colonial Bombay. The interior is fantastically done and feels rich and opulent, yet cozy and warm. We were seated upstairs and ordered two cappuccinos. They arrived in what looked like small \u00a0milkshake glasses, topped with a bit of chocolate. To be fair, they tasted good, but needed to be much hotter. I prefer my coffee in mugs that tend to keep them warmer, but that's just me. My girlfriend ordered the bacon & egg naan (noms!) and I ordered the Kejriwal -- two gloriously orange-yolked fried eggs atop chilli cheese toast with spring onions/scallions/green onions/whatever you call them here and coriander. They aren't afraid of flavor and it showed. It. Was. Perfect. Perfect size (though I could've eaten way more), perfectly cooked, perfect price at only \u00a34.90. Seriously, i can't get breakfast at the crappy takeaway down the street for \u00a34.90! The service was super fast, friendly and attentive, which pushes it to five stars for me. Price, flavor, speed, ambience. Two thumbs up. I want to go back for dinner!",

The food itself was needless to say incredible. We ordered a bunch of curries to share and everything was good. The chicken one was my fav. And definitely order the drinks.

The decor and furniture is incredibly detailed and makes you feel as though you have travelled back in time. The menus include a wide variety of food and include charming history and anecdotes for certain dishes. We tried the naan bacon breakfast sandwich as well as the porridge. The breakfast sandwich was amazing the bacon was cured and cooked in a unique sweet chili sauce which was ask so served with the plate. To say the bacon was delicious is a vast understatement. The whole sandwich worked well together. The porridge was tasty and I mostly ordered it because I had never eaten porridge before. It was simple with bananas and dried dates and very satisfying. That porridge is all you can eat. We also ordered the red grape and lemon juice which was a bit expensive at \u00a35 a glass but a thrilling combination. The drink was sour and sweet, and a nice new experience. Dishoom blew away my expectations and my wife and I still talk about how happy we were with the whole experience. We can't speak for the dinner menu and have heard there is quite a line but will definitely make this a London MUST.",

The food was delicious, I had the sausage and egg naan which was everything I expected, with a freshly squeezed orange juice. This dish is my new FAVE and will be my first stop the second I step off the Eurostar. My partner had the big Bombay breakfast which for him, needed slightly more on the plate to be a real big breakfast, but hey. The chocolate chai tea latte wasn't balanced so you couldn't taste the chai at all, unfortunate. The decor and mood is amazing, and (surprisingly!) they take breakfast reservations, although arriving at 9 and leaving at 10.30, there was definitely no need for them. Service overall was efficient and friendly enough, not enough to warrant me giving them a 4\u00a3 tip though. A definite keeper and I look forward to returning.",

Fantastic place as usual - great service (also really fast!), excellent food (those okra fries - yum!) and excellent ambiance. Not too loud for London so it was nice to actually have a conversation. I'm happy I live so close - I'll be back!",

Incredibly delicious food and warm and welcoming service from everyone we encountered. They even served warm chai and mint water to people waiting in line outside while thanking us for our patience and loyalty to the restaurant. My friend Meredith was so kind for sharing one of her favorite places with me! It's near the Kings Cross station. \u00a0Had vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, chili cheese toast, garlic naan, bowl of greens, matter paneer and basmati rice.",

    "text": "I love Dishoom more than life itself. More than my two younger siblings and the woman that gave birth to me (and they really are the best). More than watching a Keith Moon, Slash, Bowie, Bruce Foxton, Mick Gallagher supergroup gig (oooh that was tough!). More than how my lil heart keeps me alive (I'd swap an egg naan roll for a portion of heart any day of the week). More than....well everything. Honest. Ok, so the service isn't always the quickest but strangely that only seems to be the case when the restaurant is quiet, during peak times it works like clockwork. And yep sometimes it can be quicker to run the London marathon, twice, rather than queue and wait for a table but whats an hour or two in a queue right in return for a Dishoom chip butty!? ('Vada Pau' if you were wondering). The food, in particular the breakfast menu, is amazing. Great quality, and tasty. Don't expect your usual local curry house menu. The portions for dinner aren't overly huge so you may want to order a side or two to go with them. I've eaten here for breakfast about 15 or so times now and it's definitely a favourite if not THE place to find me of a morning (oh hello there stalkerface). There's lots of choice for the lunch/dinner menu too. This particular Dishoom is a really airy building spread out on different floors, go and take a wander if you have time. I love all of the pictures of India on the walls. Its great for big groups here too. There's an awesome bar 'The Permit Room' on the lower floor where the toilets are that I haven't tried yet but looks great.My favourite dishes are: the infamous breakfast naan rolls (egg please), the breakfast Akuri (spicey scrambled eggs), the chai is good and unlimited (although I think that's only at breakfast time, anyone know?) The wraps are great for lunch too and pretty much any of the curries and naan breads for dinner are winners as well. Oh what the hell, just stay for the whole day with a good book and eat your way through all the menus. Ask for a breakfast loyalty card if you're not offered one, 5 breakfast visits and a stamp each time earns you a little thank you and a naan roll and some chai on your next visit. I was there last Tuesday, oh and Friday and will most probably be there on Monday. My face, coming to a Dishoom near you soon.",

Started with the okra fingers which were fried but not greasy, and a nice vegetarian starter. The chili cheese toast was a nice appetizer and came with 4 pieces of toast. The chicken tikka was grilled after being marinated as was the paneer tikka. The black daal was excellent as were the spicy lamb chops. No meal is complete without some rice and some naan, both of which were very good. Although a chain restaurant, this was one of the best Indian meals I've had in a long time.",

    "text": "Tucked behind King's Cross, an amazing first dining experience in London for us.The two of us came for Sunday dinner, told that the wait was ~45min but we could wait downstairs at the bar. The downstairs area had a cool, lively atmosphere. There is no cell service, but they have free wifi to counter that problem. We ordered a Bombay Colada and an Edwina's Affair, the former being sweet and tangy, the latter being quite minty and refreshing. It wasn't even 30 min and we were already called for our table. We were seated on the main floor towards the back. With such a big menu - we got the Murg Malai and the Mahi Tikka (both Grill dishes). These were both very delicious and though the portions seemed small, they were very filling. We also got the Black House Daal signature, which wasn't that flavorful to our surprise. Overall, very price friendly and delicious flavors. We got 1 rice & 1 naan, but the naan was only 1 full piece so we had to order another. It was such a great meal, we came back a few days later. The second time coming, there was no wait as we came during a weekday for lunch around 11am. We got the Chicken Tikka (grill dish) and the Mattar Paneer (a curry). We loved both. We also ordered the masala chai, which comes with 5 refills. It was a drink packed with a strong, spicy flavour. It was delicious. The service was very good the first time we came - we were impressed since it was very busy but they did well in coming by frequently to check on us and the hosts at the door were great. For some reason during our second visit, they sat us at the very back with no other tables, even though there was a handful of tables available towards the front upstairs where everyone else was. We asked to be moved, which they did so kindly. They were not as attentive to getting us water refills and checking on us, though we still enjoyed our time.We didn't have the chance to come here for breakfast but would love to in the future. Highly recommended for anyone who wants some great Indian cuisine in a modern setting.",

I booked lunch reservations over a month ago, I really wanted to eat here for dinner but everything had been booked weeks in advance! We came all the way from the U.S (for sightseeing obviously) but I researched quite a bit about Indian restaurants and dishoom outbid the rest by bloggers and reviews. We were blown away by the ambiance, the vibe, the smells and sights of small gestures every where that will remind you of Bombay or India in general. The food is outstanding! You can't go wrong with ordering, we enjoyed the lamb samosas and chili cheese toasts for apps, my husband and I shared the paneer tikka, and we got a side order for cheese naan and basmati rice. Honestly everything was just perfect. Everything everyone else ordered looked perfect. The only downside is I wish we had saved room for dessert but were too stuffed to go any further. We will recommend this restaurant to all our family and friends who come to visit London. High five to the brains of this restaurant and compliments to the chef!",

    "text": "A look at the queue in front of Dishoom just gives you an idea of the buzz that surrounds this indian concept...it's crazy, and so was my excitement yesterday night for my first try. This type of buzz is certainly something I've never seen where I'm from (Bruxelles). Food is definitely 5-stars-worthy: I've rarely eaten such tender and tasteful pieces of chicken (Murgh Malai), their Dal is a classic, and I totally got why, same story goes for their special : a lamb stew slowly cooked for months, well maybe not but surely tasted like it. So YES, Food = delicious. But...What I'm not sure is if this very good indian food is worth the 1h30min wait (30min outside, 1 hour in their Permit Room). To be honest, I've heard such good things about London Indian's restaurants even before Dishoom existed...in a few words, I'm pretty sure I can find about the same quality in a more well, \"normal\" indian place I guess...not sure if their strategy will pay off in the long run.Anyway, the place looks like a Museum, team is lovely, and they even offer chai tea while you're waiting in the cold. Nice right ? PS : Trying their breakfast/brunch might be the best tip if you'd kill to go there, without the waiting the waiting part.",

But it was soo good! You could really taste the spices!! The way it should be!Now to the food!! Simply a really good twist to fusing Indian and western brekky. Think of it as instead of a sausage mcmuffin, you get a sausage naan!! Same with a bacon and egg naan!!Any ways, all in all great experience. The restaurant itself is really nice as well!",

    "text": "So far I have loved every single Dishoom that has opened and if I may dare say it, it might be my favourite chain restaurant.Like their sisters the venue is massive consisting of three floors, up stairs for the formal restaurant, ground floor for the lounge and downstairs for the bar area. All children friendly though as I saw families with children \u00a0in every section. As we made a reservation and I highly recommend it if you want to be seated immediately, we were seated upstairs.With views over to the ground floor the place felt big and airy maximised by its high ceilings. Although I was quite confused to why the ceiling fans were still turned in the middle of Winter wasting electricity and not helping the place keep warm. The wooden decor was lovely though, dark mahogany with its spiral staircase and simple dangling lamp shades. Noise levels drown out and the seating layout allow you to wind down happily with your companions.As this was a breakfast date was my partner we went crazy and ordered the following:Sausage and egg naan roll. The dough had a lovely bite to it being stretchy and warm. The flavour almost creamy with a nice smokiness to it from the browning. It was filled with sausages that could have been cooked slightly less to have kept its lovely juices and bounce being quite dense. But the flavours and spices redeem itself and paired with the two delicious runny sunny side up and a good kick from the chilli jam I still enjoyed it very much.Chilli cheese toast with two fried egg. I found the cheese toast slightly on the overcooked side. But that's because I prefer my cheese more stretchy but the flavours were rich, well spiced and plentiful of herbs creating an extreme mix of flavours in one bite. Delicious. The runny yolk help add that beautiful moisture and earthiness that added to the tasty experience.Bombay omelette So much flavour! The minced meat was so beautifully spiced my tongue was trying to keep up with all the taste. I noticed a pattern here is that they like their things well done. The egg itself was slightly overcooked for me I found it lost its silkiness and became crisp. But once given all can be forgiven by the flavours and together eaten with the soft buttered toast, washed down with my chai tea it was totally awesome. Keema per eedu. A very rich spicy dish of minced chicken and liver pieces topped with potato chips and a runny egg. The only dish where I'm not complaining that something is overcooked. The tender pieces of chicken went really well against the softer smoother kidney pieces. Together with the crunches from the potato chips and soft runny egg the sensation in my mouth was amazing. The spices used was also incredibly fragrant and not just there for the kick. It was also served with soft fluffy buttered toasted buns which were helpful in reducing the heat. Delicious and very filling and wholesome.Although this is a brunch review I have also been for dinner and it was just as mind blowing and expressive. Whether it's for a date, casual dining or special celebration I'm sure Dishoom caters for everything. It's in such a location too, near Granary Square right beside the lovely canal. Service has been friendly every time I visit. Did I mention that if you order Chai Tea it comes unlimited? So awesome.",

    "text": "Had heard a lot about Dishoom which tries to replicate quintessential Mumbai Cafe's and was surprised when we found one Tucked away behind Granary Square, Kings Cross. We decided to try it out and it was indeed a new one which had just opened.The Decor - from the moment you enter has a Indian touch, or rather a Mumbai (Bombay) feel to it with Hindi Scripts and Indian artefacts and humour. The music is retro Bollywood and the menu is local Mumbai. I found the dishes reasonably priced. I ordered a Dishum Chicken Tikka(\u00a37.50) and a portion of Cheense Nan (\u00a32.50). My fried decided to go light and ordered from the light bites - he ordered a Bhel (Street food made with Puffed Rice), Vada Pav (Check out my review of Sree Krishna Vada Pav) and a glass of Sugarcane Juice. We decided to share a portion of Gunpowder Potato(\u00a35.20) (Roasted Potatoes with hot chilli and spices). The food quickly arrived and literally blew me away! It had the heat and spiciness, the kind we get in an Indian restaurant in India! It was refreshing and there was no attempt made to tailor it to local palate. I looked around me and saw the majority of clientele were non-Indians and were obviously enjoying the food, a big change from the standard curry joints.The menu has only two curry dishes and all other stuff are authentic Indian stuff. The waiters are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.It was a bombardment of senses - I closed my eyes for an instant and The Decor, food, the smells of incense sticks and the old Bollywood songs transported me to my favourite Mumbai cafe. Highly recommended.PS : \u00a0Dishum are giving away \u00a310 vouchers to every visitor which can be redeemed between Jan and Mar at their Kings Cross Branch, minimum spend of \u00a340 required to claim.",
