The staff have been good, getting us a table straight away (although don't move the chairs to a different table or you will get told off!). The drinks are expensive, as one would expect, but they aren't too bad. A bottle of wine is currently \u00a332, so not bad if there's a few of you. Beers were around \u00a35-6 and cocktails \u00a312. It is a nice relaxed atmosphere and on Monday night there was a band and lounge singer for entertainment. The view is amazing as expected and it is a cheap way of getting close to the view from the shard. The bar serves food although we didn't look at the menu so can't comment.",

The portions are the perfect size to let you save room for dessert, so that you aren't super full.

    "text": "London, England - The Shard Tower - Absolute must.Lucky enough to dine on opening nite. \u00a0Literally lucky enough. \u00a0Arrived on a whim after visiting the observation deck at the Shard the day before. \u00a0So, didn't have the luxury to check Yelp prior to visiting.Upon entry immediately noticed a ton of suits and the guys who ordered drinks before me had their AMEX Black Cards ready to go. \u00a0I on the other hand was damn stoked to be in such a cool spot in London. Of course the place was sold out and I was immediately denied a dining opportunity. However, after doing what I do best staff asked the Bar Manager and he offered me one of the lounge tables (seating up to 4) as long as I can bounce in 2.5 hours - DONE!As I sat down and handed a menu one of the two suits I chatted up for a bit earlier in the evening came back from the Dining room, looking for me and asked to join his partner at their 4 top. \u00a0No Brainer! \u00a0So I kindly and appropriately thanked the manager for his earlier gesture of hospitality and made my way into the dining room.The three of us did some damage. \u00a0Sure if we had more people then guess what? \u00a0We would have ordered more. \u00a0All in all - The Bone-In Rib Eye was amazing, the sirloin was nice and the Waygu didn't arrive... Understandably there are some quirks - other than that all the sides were okay, carrots, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, chips and there bread was fantastic. \u00a0No other place like this in London, with the view, good food and good live jazz. \u00a0I highly recommend this place to be on the \"to do\" list while in London.Keep in mind there are two areas, the lounge/bar with the music. \u00a0You can eat there as well but the actual bar does not offer a menu (soon to occur). \u00a0I prefer and ate on the otherside where you can see the kitchen and is more of a dining room. \u00a0Both have good vibes.So the bottom line is I came solo, had No Reservation and straight up made the most of it. \u00a0Better yet on opening night. \u00a0When I decide to visit London again I wouldn't mind trying it out again. \u00a0Only Word of Caution! \u00a0 Yes the venue is great, food (when it arrives) is solid but from what I experienced and from the reviews on Trip A***** they are still having communciation issues, refering to the service.Seems so odd - that service is all over the place given the greeting you receive prior to the elevators and upon arrival to the restaurant - the girls with their ipads and stoic expressions make you feel as if this place is 100% on point, but Not - yet",

A leather covered lift takes you up swiftly up to the 32nd floor and you think you're prepared to see what's coming - but you really are not. I went there on a sunny evening of a Thursday and enjoyed a perfectly made Manhattan and a bunch of white wine spritzers. They have comfy sofas and pouffes around low coffee tables so you can enjoy your (very expensive!) alcohol with a bunch of friends while listening to a live band performance.They have table service - I love bars that have that - but it may also mean you may get more drunk than you've planned - just because you no longer need to make that trip to the bar.People are normal City folk - probably more mature than, say, the Folly.Definitely recommend - but be prepared to pay, I found it quite annoying that ordering at the bar still includes service charge. And also - no bar snacks - only peanuts with bacon - I would have expected a wider selection for a place like that. Hence - the 4 not 5 stars.",

    "text": "What a view! and great food. Oblix is necessarily going to be compared to Galvin at Windows, and I would say it succeeds on the trendy, sharp-dressers, slick-side of things where Galvin is more 'comfortable' in it's presentation. However, I would say that Galvin's cuisine is \"remarkable\" & \"exceptional\", whereas Oblix \"did not disappoint.\"Oblix feels completely over-staffed when you arrive : 3 women with iPads greet you, there are then a plethora of young men (footmen? runners? greeters?) standing in the corridor behind them.We arrived for an early seating, and seemed to catch the tail-end of the afternoon crowd (at 6:30pm). Booking so far in advance we were able to have excellent seats at the window with a view over the Thames towards St Paul's. By sunset (after 8pm) it was just breath-taking : and that is what you're paying for!Food was good - lovely starters, fresh, adventurous, beautifully presented. Mains - also good, altho' we felt our beef tenderloin was slightly over-done and we ordered it rare/medium-rare. The sauces it is served with are delicious, and generous. Sides - I didn't want to order anything I could make at home, so we went for the carrots, in honey and ginger. They're smoked, so it's quite a strong flavour. Hmmm... not my taste. Cauliflower roasted with peanuts, caper berry sauce and passion fruit - an interesting take on a veggie everyone avoids. Good call, mr waiter.Desserts were excellent. Wish I could have had 3 ;-)Wines. sigh... this is where they fell down. We both had a glass of white (two different estates) to start and both were lack-lustre. I then had a second white, this time an Austrian Riesling (\u00a315/glass). Nope, it was also a disappointment. However, we did have an Australian red with the beef, and that was really good. I hope they'll revise their wine list (by the glass), it needs attention.In contrast to John (previous reviewer), we felt the service was very attentive and although it got much busier as the evening progressed, we were able to catch a waiter's eye whenever we needed anything.Would I go back ? yes, definitely.I want to try out the bar next time, which also serves food (you can book a table if you're eating there) and the live jazz drew us in (\u00a312 cover charge apparently). See you soon Oblix",

Then arrived the sommelier who requested our wine choice prior to our ordering our mains, of which he specifically helped pick out a pinot noir that would accompany our lobster. The wine is served even though we have yet to order our mains. Finally our server arrives only to relay they are out of lobster of which the sommelier had specifically paired our wine. Thus we pick alternative mains and are stuck with the wine. My sea bass fills the plate in a lump with no flavour. P's tiger prawn is one whole piece from head to end and not much meat in between, with eyeballs to boot! We've ordered a take away bag to give to a rough sleeper on the way out. There are no questions why we've left most of our food untouched. Our server long ago exited without relaying and 3 different staff interactions followed. I was pleased with our bill as the \u00a385 bottle of pinot noir was excluded however gut feeling stated this was most likely unintended. Whilst I'd like to have retained the \"stupidity tax\" I relayed the error to a new server who then brought over the manager. No apologies or discount of gratitude for their error was acknowledged as they took a separate payment for the full \u00a385 bottle. I'd say lack of communication from management down killed a potentially conducive elegant dining experience.",

    "text": "There are lots of amazing things about Oblix, no doubt.The view is fantastic. \u00a0In the restaurant, you get the London Eye, St. Paul's, BT Tower, etc. \u00a0In the Lounge, you get a stellar view of Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf. \u00a0The service is impeccable. \u00a0They had no qualms about letting us switch tables for dessert to one that was up against the windows. \u00a0The hostess will lead you to your table, and wait for your entire party to join, despite your pausing at the windows to marvel. \u00a0Most interesting to me, in order to get to your table, you must walk through the entire kitchen, where many of the chefs are happy to tell you hello on arrival, and thank you on exit.That being said... the food was a killer for me. \u00a0Was it bad? No. \u00a0But it was just decent, and I was hoping for so much more. \u00a0Generally speaking, there was a total lack of salt in almost every dish. \u00a0And we ordered several. \u00a0The lobster and scallop ceviche was definitely my favorite starter, with the veal chop being a solid main (and one of the only items with seasoning, although still lacking a bit of salt), and the best side was the corn with truffle. \u00a0Also tasty is the duck from the rotisserie. \u00a0The bone-in ribeye was sadly flavorless and slightly overcooked. \u00a0The pork belly was very eh. \u00a0The mac and cheese, which when done well is my favorite food on the earth, was so lackluster I wouldn't recommend that anyone give it a go. \u00a0It was void of both the cheesiness and the creaminess I believe mac requires. \u00a0The seared scallop starter was half chewy (one scallop) and half fine (the other scallop). \u00a0And so on.Beware the snarky sommelier who hates Malbecs and will chide your group (\"Malbecs are the PIzza Hut of wines.\") for even mentioning them!Oblix is worth a go if only for the view alone, but be careful what you order lest you face disappointment!",

    "text": "I came here whilst working in London a few weeks back, more on research for a place to dine at over Christmas. \u00a0What takes you back initially, is the Shard itself & going up in a lift that only stops at this floor... prepare for your ears to get sucked in, as it's rapid!Really friendly welcome, but as we were 30 minutes early, just had a drink in the bar whilst the table was made ready. \u00a0Randomly, we sat here for 45 minutes & I had to eventually ask if the table was ready, given they never called us over.I don't get the dark corridors between the bar and the restaurant. It's a bit daft and ponsey, even by my standards! \u00a0Views however, are breathtaking up here and that makes up for the other parts you might not like!Only stuck with 2 glasses of wine, as at \u00a312 a glass, you really didn't want to go crazy here! \u00a0Starters, I went for the Scallops and my friend had the smoked salmon flat bread.OMG.. these scallops were ridiculous! \u00a0Hands down the BEST I've ever had anywhere in the world. \u00a0Hand dived and grilled in a sauce I cannot even describe, but you are transcended into another level eating these. \u00a0At \u00a316.50 for two (cut in half!), you really had to be to not feel cheated! \u00a0My friend couldn't eat her flat bread, as it was the size of a pizza. \u00a0I really don't like smoked salmon, but I thought I'd give it a go & ended up eating half of it... safe to say, I like Oblix smoked salmon!Mains, I went for sirloin steak, as recommended by the waiter, reasonable at \u00a335 (for London!) and my mate had the king prawn. \u00a0Sides of creamy mash, mac and cheese and chunky chips. \u00a0Again.... OMG. \u00a0Damn, this was a fine steak cooked to perfection, but more than that.. it was tender and bursting with epic natural flavours. In the top five steaks I've had worldwide, easily. \u00a0Couldn't not have dessert and spying a New York Cheesecake, I had to have it. \u00a0It was nice, but not awesome & I've made much better myself. \u00a03/5 for that, but majority of folk will still love it. Bill for two with two glasses of wine and service charge, came to \u00a3160. \u00a0Given I just paid \u00a3145 to MPW in Glasgow, this was worth every single penny & you didn't feel cheated or begrudged paying. \u00a0With those views, the service and the food to match, this was also more of an experience than just having a bite to eat. \u00a0I've booked it in October to take our Fiona for dinner when we are away ourselves, it really is that good. \u00a0Book well in advance and you WILL NOT be disappointed!You Gotta Eat Here - NOW!!! :-D",

    "text": "Going to a newly opened restaurant is great, but rolling 6 deep with group of yelpers is AWESOME. Why? We all want to try everything. We all share the dishes family style and get to sampler more dishes without breaking the bank. And at this already $$$$ restaurant, that's more value for your monayyyy. We arrived promptly before our reservation time and were told you go enjoy ourselves at the lounge first while they set our table. The lounge was packed full of people. There was hardly anywhere to stand. But wowzer, THE VIEW. It was stunning. You could see the curve of the Thames and Tower Bridge. It looked so small from up there. I have to say that this was my favorite view out of all the rooftop bars, restaurants in towers, etc. This was it. It's really gorgeous.When we finally got seated, we figured the evening called for wine and cocktails. We then went about ordering pretty much everything on the menu. My FAVORITES for the night included:-lobster & scallop ceviche, jalapeno, coriander & sweet pepper 21-grilled diver scallops, sweetcorn & black pepper, rocket butter 16.5-seared beef, lime, chilli, garlic & ginger dressing 13-sweetcorn & summer truffle 9-veal chop and gremolata 34-roasted cauliflower, almonds & caper berries 7NOT my favorites:-crispy pork belly, apple chutney & mustard seeds 18-macaroni & cheese 5.5-bone in rib-eye (800g) 65-duck with mango chutney 26-steak tartare, beef tomato, grilled sour dough 14The \"not my favorites\" dishes needed some work. They were either tasteless or overcooked or something. Given that the restaurant was still pretty new at the time, I'm just going to assume they were still working out the kinks. But even though the food was probably an overall 3 star rating, I still had a lovely experience. I was in good company overlooking London from the newly opened Shard from the 32rd floor. Life was good.",

I thought there must be a fantastic lounge/restaurant in it that I can sip a flute of sparkling champagne and stunned by surrounding London city views. There must be one!! I was right!! I found oblix at the shard. Took my lovely girlfriend up to 32th floor, we both were amazed by the views greeting us. We came in around happy hours in the late afternoon, the lounge was full of 007 James Bond type British gentlemen. It didn't take us too long to be seated. We lucky found a small table right by the window. Ordered a bottle of wine we girls started taking all kinds of selfies and pictures. The price of wine was pretty reasonable. We both got a little bit tipsy and had millions of pictures in our cameras. What a wonderful night !!!",

The chips were good but the peppers j would give a miss. Of course the view was amazing so I would say that brings this place up a notch.

    "text": "Whilst chatting to Jesse, Andrew M's friend who was visiting from the States, I found out that his mother used to be a food critic for the Washington Post. She had some words of wisdom accumulated from years of experience. The most amusing was to eat somewhere that you see customers arguing with each other, the reason being that these customers must love the restaurant to come back so often that they are comfortable enough to be seen arguing in public!However, her most pertinent advice was to avoid eating anywhere with a spectacular view as you'll be paying largely for the view and not the quality of the food. This was because we were having this conversation eating at Oblix at the Shard, London's newly opened tallest building in Europe. Andrew had kindly organised a table for 5 of us to experience one of London's highest restaurants, though being on the 32nd floor puts the restaurant only about halfway up the towerNo matter that it isn't near the top because the view is spectacular and on a clear night like the night we were there, the Shard's location right on the river near London Bridge station means that you can take in London's iconic sights such as Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Canary Wharf and the O2 from the lounge side of the building and the London Eye. Houses of Parliament and Wembley from the restaurant side. The view here trumps that from Duck & Waffle, which is located on the 42nd floor of the Heron BuildingA month since opening, they've still not updated their website to include menus. This is extremely frustrating - why have a website and not put your menu up?We arrived a little early and were directed to the Lounge, where there was a live jazz band playing. However, it was rammed and every time we tried to sit at a table when someone left, we were shooed away as it was reserved. In fact, having intended to get a drink, we actually left as it was unpleasant and there wasn't even anywhere to stand comfortably as the floor space is packed with tables. When it's more comfortable to stand by the lifts rather than wait in the lounge, there's something not quite rightBang on our reservation time, we were led to our table. The walk through the kitchen is a nice touch for a foodie like me and the lady who showed us to our table was patient in what must be a frequent thing with guests stopping to take photos of the view (everyone else) and the food and kitchen (me!). 5 of us were then crammed into a table only really big enough for 4 people. Not cool when you've made a reservationI then had to turn on the torch app on my iPhone to be able to read the menu. You can tell how dark it was from my photos. There was only 1 spotlight on the table and the rest of it was in darkness. It was also extremely noisy. Although we were crammed onto the small table, it was very hard to have a conversation with anyone except the person next to youThe food is 'designed for sharing' according to the menu - ie the main courses come with no accompaniments and sides run around the \u00a37 - 8 mark. Definitely come in a bigger group as we did so that you get to try a variety of dishesFor starters, we had scallop & lobster ceviche, seared scallops, seared beef, and beef tartare. All competent but the prices were expensive for the quality of cooking and portion sizes. I did like the olive bread thoughFor mains, we went for roast duck, belly pork, veal chop, bone-in ribeye and a host of sides including sweetcorn with summer truffle and roasted cauliflower. My favourite was the duck, which was juicy and moist as was the belly pork. The rest of the dishes were competently cooked but not worth the price they were chargingDesserts brought a pecan & chocolate bar, a cookie jar and trio of sorbets.With 2 bottles of wine and 2 bottles of mineral water, we paid around \u00a370 a head. If you take off the \u00a325 we would have paid per person to go up the Shard if we were paying just to go up for the view, the meal would weigh in at \u00a345 per person and even at this reduced price, I would have to judge our visit a 3 star experienceI think Oblix is going to have an LA vibe - a place for celebrities and beautiful to hang out to be seen as much as to dine. I heard that Jennifer Lopez and Jamie Oliver have already eaten here.If you have a date you really want to impress, bring them here for the view and pay the maitre d' a little extra to make sure you get a table right by the window and you're onto a winner but only if you also pick up the tab",

Then into the light, warm wood space of the bar.My review is solely for the bar, which also takes table reservations and you will need one here because it was packed out. I don't like that because I don't want to be that up close and personal to anyone I'm not intimate with. It would help if a few tables were taken out of the floor area.It's a nice looking space and they have an area for live music too. Pleasant service and appropriately dressed patrons. This is my (and my friends) kind of bar. We will defo come back for an evening session.It's gorgeous here.",

Restaurant is located in the Shard and from the door to check in, everything gives off trendy chic. I felt I was in a movie (a la Will Smith's Hitch) and we only made it to the bar. Food was amazing and the view was breathtaking. We got there early at 6pm but turns out it was perfect timing as we were able to see the sun set against the city skyline. Service was good (not as good as some other top notch places I've \u00a0been) but the Sommelier made the night with his after dinner tour of the wine cellar and knowledge he expounded while selecting a desert wine for us (all of which was after we paid for our meals). Price is a bit high but was well worth it! Over all a great experience!",

    "text": "Being up on the 32nd floor of the Shard is a treat, all by itself. You're afforded the most amazing views, unobscured by nearby skyscrapers in a beautiful setting.We'd arrived early and were guided to the bar whilst we waited for our table. Unfortunately, being a weekday evening in Central London, there was no available seating.Actually, that's a lie - there was LOADS of available seats. The problem? They were all reserved. Lets look past the fact that the seats in the bar area were reservable, but that they were empty.. just begging to be sat on. And we had to stand. Yes, this is #FirstWorldProblems at its finest.However, we got a drink at the bar and the lovely bartender made us several Mocktails and was very charming. In a small incident, my dinner date found a hair in her drink, and on letting the bartender know, she apologised and proceeded to make another drink, on the house.20 minutes later, and fighting the temptation to just sit on the piano seat and pretend I'm tonight's entertainment, we headed over to the restaurant where a hostess looked very confused by the prospect that we could possibly have something called a 'reservation' for dinner.She went away to confer with her colleagues, and came back after a few minutes to inform us that our table was being prepared (80% of the restaurant's tables, though prepared, were yet to be filled) and we took a seat whilst we our already prepared table was.. err.. prepared.Once seated however, our waiter was a delight and made us feel right at home and everything that happened prior was suddenly a distant memory. He was friendly, funny and charming, without being too imposing, which is just about all you need from your waiter.The food was lush too - I ordered the Rib-eye steak (Medium-Rare), and my dinner date opted for the Lamb chops, with harissa and yoghurt. Both came out cooked incredibly well and we were left very happy.We'd been unlucky in our timing not to have gotten a table next to the windows, but somewhere between the main course and dessert, I cheekily summoned the courage to ask if we could move to the recently vacated table seat, and the waiter (after a quick check with his manager) gave the sly wink that we could move across, and he happily took our photo for us (even telling us to perk up our pose!)All in all, Oblix is a great night out, though definitely not light on the bank balance. Much recommended for a special occasion, and definitely pop back into the bar after your meal, as there is often live music on.",

This time things were not quite this good. The duck was probably 30sec to a minute over cooked and not pink and was a bit chewy but still good. We had the octopus and burrata starters which were delicious. The service was. so. Weird. I was really entertained people watching. Lots of dishes being dropped and cracking (at least 3 in the hour I was there) then a waiter literally poured the entire glass of coke onto a customer and he was silently furious. Also saw very some very aggravated wait staff arguing w the manager. One thing that was annoying was that it was really difficult to get my water refilled!! Jesus I didn't want to spend \u00a312 on a bottle of water but I was seriously thirsty. Anyways, it wasn't as good as it once was but wasn't terrible. Is it worth \u00a350 for a Sunday roast?? Maybe- there's the view and the entertaining wait staff but maybe bring your own water??",

    "text": "Looked forward to dining here as love the Shard. \u00a0Bookatable was offering a really affordable deal. The layout of the Lounge meant that you could sit anywhere and you could get a view except a couple of black spots. \u00a0All the tables by the windows are tables for two, some bar chairs in one corner, and the tables that are more into the centre of the Lounge were high tables with high seating so you could still get a view. I originally booked for four on the bookatable website, because they were doing an amazing deal for 3 courses plus a glass of bubbly for \u00a332, but I had to change the reservation at the last minute to increase our numbers, but was unable to do so when I called the restaurant, because I had made the booking online. \u00a0When I enquired with bookatable, they said I needed to contact the restaurant, as their online booking did not have the facility to amend the booking, only to cancel. \u00a0So it was catch 22! \u00a0I spoke to the restaurant again, and finally, the reservations person, heard my predicament and plea, and amended my booking, and booked me into the Lounge, and I was told the seating there is very comfortable with sofas at tables, and tables with very comfortable high chairs. Which all sounded really interesting. \u00a0But what a palaver with the booking system.However, all was redeemed as on arrival, the welcome was lovely and attentive. \u00a0We were seated at a table with really comfortable seating in an U-shaped settee facing into the room, and one part facing the window, with the lovely views of the Walkie Talkie building, the Gherkin, Tower Bridge and Tower of London. \u00a0At the other end, there is also a view of the railways running right below the building going east. The atmosphere was very relaxed and the service was very observant, but not obtrusive. The starters were really substantial and was fine, but the mains were not as good. \u00a0My crab and chili linguine was quite salty and the steak was very, very chewy. The chips, however, were divine, and very more-ish. \u00a0The best dishes was the duck, which went well with the mango and watercress salad; and the salmon nicoise, which was perfectly cooked.Then on to the desserts, the blackberry and apple eclair sounded really yummy on paper, but when it came it looked really strange like a long cigar filled with cream and decorated with blackberries, and did not taste that great, and was quite sour. \u00a0The flourless chocolate cake with ice cream fared a bit better, but nothing special. \u00a0So all in all, lovely views, lovely service, but some of the food, even though looks great, could have been better.",

Watching downtown abbey surely takes a good toll on a man. I really want to say the food was amazing but it wasn't.

The restaurant itself is pretty amazing, I loved the open kitchen, seating, layout and the huge fridge full of meat! Service was as expected, drinks where lovely, but it was the food itself which let me down a bit...and that is what a restaurant is all about really!To Start I went for the Beef Tartare, this was the best bit of the meal. fresh, juicy and a good sized portion. We were off to a good start!Up next I was going to go for the Duck and Mango, but they had sold out (not the end of the world, but not ideal for a lunchtime service), so instead I went with the Black Cod. It was nice, but it was nowhere near the levels I expected and compared to my favourite (ROKA if you're asking) it was just average.Other people on my table opted for the steak, again it was nice, but nothing compared to the likes of Goodman,s Gaucho and Hawksmoor.Overall the food was good, but I don't think the fact you have a nice view, means a place can compromise on the quality of food. If you want to charge high end prices that's fine, but it needs to be on par with other places that do the same, and Oblix just wasn't.One other thing which isn't really the restaurants fault...the views are amazing, but the windows are terrible because of the design of the building, so any fancy pics will have a bit of a reflection on them!",

Excellent, every course.It didn't hurt that I was at a bar with a view directly over west end London with St. Paul's, parliament, and the London eye all in sight.It's a little pricy, but that wasn't a surprise.

    "text": "Despite being separated from the Shangri-La by only 3 floors, we had to take a lift all the way down to ground, walk around to the separate entrance to Oblix and take another ear-popping lift back up into the air to get to this bar. We were after some post-dinner drinks and that mission only added to our thirst! We hesitated at the door though when told that there was live music on for an extra \u00a35pp cover charge - would it be worth it? Thankfully the lady on the door sensed our dilemma and said we were welcome to go and have a look inside first, but warned us there was only standing room at the bar. What a fib. We followed the buzz down the long dimly-lit corridor to find several empty bar stools at the high tables next to the bar and quickly nabbed 3, as there was a live jazz singer on who sounded pretty good. Not sure why the lady outside had been telling people the bar seating was full - perhaps their reservation system doesn't account for when people leave?!We were served at the table (eventually) by a friendly French-accented waiter, who I confess I'd thought had approached my colleague to try and chat her up initially given he was wearing a suit! The other two ordered Ginger cocktails, with one actually asking for less rum than standard (madness I know) and we ended up drinking half of them by trying to taste-test which one was which! I got a Lemongrass sparkling cocktail with gin, lime and prosecco which was disappointingly quite flavourless, almost as if all the tasty ingredients cancelled each other out.There's plenty of flattering low lighting plus the smooth jazz that would make this a romantic drinks stop - in fact we went to see the exact corner where one of the other girls got proposed to a few months earlier! But be aware the bar is in the centre of the room and competition for the best views by the windows is high - beautiful yes, but you've got more chance of enjoying those elsewhere in the Shard.It turned into a pricey stop for a flavourless cocktail, but at least I know what not to order next time. Though the spendy cocktail competition around this price point is so high (quite literally in this case - see what I did there?!) that I'm not in any rush to go back.",

It is managed or rather orchestrated thoughtfully and with the utmost attention to detail. Unlike most places in London, the reception is warm, attentive, sharp, organised and on point. The best welcome to start a gorgeous evening. First of all we decided to dine in the lounge as we love live music. The food was great! It's all about the sharing plates. We loved the octopus, spare ribs, tiger prawn, sirloin, and squid. The cocktails were spectacular. The bartenders are on a different level. My lavender cocktail lifted me to a spa in bora bora. You have to try the dessert cocktails too. Swoon. Get dessert. Chocolate brownie sundae! Yum. The live music was surreal. The singer was a power house and very reminiscent of Aretha Franklin. From the 32nd floor, I was definitely on cloud 9! I'm truly grateful to have spent our 2nd year anniversary here in the most special and magical way. Thank you!",

Had to wave someone down for a second drink.The bill comes, they added a service charge. I can accept that, it's probably the norm here. Not a problem. I pay in cash. I am owed change.It takes them twenty minutes for someone to come back to me and go he needs to get a manager because he's not allowed to deal with the cash, and so is unable to give me my change.We arnt talking that much money here by the way.That's funny, so you work here but only certain people are allowed to handle the cash? Ok that maybe true, well stop bothering me and making me wait and get your manager to take care of it.Another 15 minutes, I'm assuming the manager is this tall blonde woman who was dressed well. I'm watching and she is walking around aimlessly not taking care of anything in particular. It got to a point that it just was not worth it to me. I walked away.Very disappointed I will not be back here, there are other restaurants in the building.If you want to claim to be one of the better restaurants in London act like it.

My husband was asked to remove his ball cap, no problem - but they sent a manager to do it. Why didn't the hostess out front take it before we walked in when she took our coats? Why didn't the first server, or second server say something? \u00a0 That just makes it a point of embarrassment instead of a simple dress code standard. The hostess seemed shocked we didn't have a lunch reservation and made it seem like they were squeezing us in (to their nearly empty restaurant). We were given a beautiful table right by the window... without a reservation.We felt like our server was disappointed we only wanted appetizers and cocktails to start. I told her we'd take it from there with a main course but she chose to neglect us. I had to call her over multiple times, which is disappointing for such a \"high class\" and expensive restaurant. We were so irritated we opted out of anything beyond the apps although that wasn't our original plan. The views from the shard are amazing, and the food and drinks are delicious. But if I'm being honest, we had better food for much less later that day at a place that didn't make us feel like we were below their standard. My recommendation would be to see the views, absolutely. But just get a cocktail - don't bother with food. Oh and maybe make a reservation to avoid shocking the staff.",

Once through the security check, you enter the lift to go to the 32nd floor. Once on the 32nd floor, you're greeted by a host/hostess who let you know about the seating situation. My mum and I were just there for drinks, and we were told that the bar was at capacity, but that we can go in and find a spot (the host admitted to saying that the bar was at capacity because there was a family of four ahead of us that wanted to go in and they didn't want the kids in there). We walked in and noticed that the bar was nowhere near full capacity. Anyway, Mum and I settled in and ordered a wonderful half bottle of ros\u00e9 sparkling wine. We couldn't help but notice that the smart casual dress code wasn't being upheld, hence my low-star review. Now, if the dress code has been relaxed, then my apologies for not being aware. But I saw plenty of people in the bar with trainers/sports shoes and more casual than smart attire. Even with these drawbacks and the pricey drinks, I'd still recommend Oblix for the atmosphere and the amazing view.",

Although you will pay a pretty penny, if you can swing it I would highly suggest coming here.We got there early to walk around the restaurant and enjoy the view. We ordered drinks at the bar which was very fun. They have all these cool names and are unusual so we enjoyed trying them. My dad ordered a tequila cocktail and it had egg whites on it and a little bag of pistachio dust clipped to it. Very different but SO DELISH. Did not think I would like it but I would have ordered one for myself. I had a Las Vegas showgirl that was something along the lines of vodka and some juice. At the bottom was a lip candy which was a cute/funny little addition. It was a good drink but the tequila was way better.We finally sat down and ordered. I got a lobster tail and prime rib. HOLY MOLEY! Talk about melt in your mouth, dance around bc the food it that good. I was so impressed and would eat it for every meal if I could. It was served with a \"salsa verde\" which I would have classified as more of a pesto type sauce-regardless it was delicious. We ordered a bunch of sides and shared them all. The Mac and cheese/potatoes being my favorite! The service was good and I would definitely return when I have the extra funds. Tip! Order drinks and walk around, the view is impeccable and you won't regret it!",

    "text": "When you first walk into the Shard, there is a security check and scan before you enter the elevators. Once you get in the elevators, no need to press any buttons and just enjoy the quick 15 second ride up to the 32nd floor. Oblix shares the same floor as the the other restaurants but is located on one side. There is coat check available before you enter in the restaurant. To go through the seating area you'll first walk through the open front kitchen. It's a cool design concept in my opinion but also feels rather strange since its brightly lit and then you immediately switch over to a dimly light dining area. My group of four was seated at a booth. The booth was quite nice and had the view of the wine room. We could see a bit of the London view from where we were but from a distance. To be honest, I don't think Oblix has the best view. Later we ventured over to the Hu Tong/Aqua Shard side and I liked their view a lot more.For starters, my group ordered the crab cakes and smoked salmon flatbread. Both were good dishes. The crab cakes were 2 pieces, warm and soft. They were served with a side salad. The smoked salmon flatbread was in a shape of a pizza. They definitely gave a generous helping of smoked salmon.For entrees we ordered duck for two, lobster and Bbq black cod. Our sides were mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Out of all the entrees I really enjoyed the Bbq black cod. It was so soft and perfect. I thought the BBQ sauce was a decent addition to the dish but didn't particularly enjoy the salsa side. The duck was also well cooked and not a bad dish. The lobster however was so dry and hardly had any meat on it. It was a rather disappointing dish. For desserts we ordered the cheesecake and seasonal Thai mango and exotic sorbet. I really enjoyed the mangoes! They were in season and just the best tasting mangoes. It combined really well with the three different sorbet flavors. I also got a fresh fruit juice which if I \u00a0am remember was a blend of grapefruit, passion fruit and one other fruit. It was delicious!",

We were seated but there was no server attending to us. After 15 minutes, I had to go up to the bar to request service. The views are great but you're paying for it in the price of the drinks. Given the terrible service, the atmosphere was spoiled. Unless you're dressed proper, I feel like you won't be properly serviced and will be treated secondhand.",

The food is definitely good, and it's a very cool set up because you walk past all the chef's cooking their beautiful dishes when going to your table. Unfortunately you cannot reserve a table directly by the windows, but you still have a lovely view no matter where you are. We went big here. We ordered the seafood sharing appetiser which was way too much money but very fun to look at. Seriously go look at the pictures. The experience was lovely, but it's probably not a place I would need to go to again, unless some out of towers insisted. The prices are high but for obvious reasons, and their food is very good. The aubergine flat bread was delicious, and the King Crab Risotto was chock-a-block filled with crab. Yes I did just say chock-a-block. I heard a woman say it the other day so it's a thing. I was very impressed, with the saying and the crab.",

    "text": "So, let me say that the one star here is for Maria and GM Travis, who did everything they could to make a cruddy situation a little better. Props to them both. Otherwise, this would be zero stars if I could even do that.We're spending several days in London and decided to add this to the dinner plans on our second night in town. Lovely view, cool venue. Not as cool when we saw how insanely overpriced the drinks were. Seriously, @ \u00a325 for Bulleit? But we figure, what the heck. It's a tourist trap anyhow, so why not? Really not cool when the Caesar salad shows up.I have my first bite and then see 2 hairs on what would have been the second bite. Gross. My husband tells a member of the wait staff, who clears the plate without comment and talks to the manager, but no one ever comes back to talk to us. Our original waiter brings the utensils for main course. Now we're confused. My husband gets up and speaks with Maria as no one has said anything about it to us, nor about replacing the salad, or taking it off the bill. Maria ends up coming to the table and made a kind gesture of sending over additional side dishes for our main course. The GM comes over in apologizes. We figure that this type of thing happens occasionally, so we proceed on with dinner.Then, my husband's steak arrives. It comes with a new bonus side dish, more hair on top. Not even joking. \u00a0We are now thoroughly grossed out. On top \u00a0of it all, my husband had planned a special \u00a0dessert with the restaurant for our anniversary. That was not going to be.The general manager now comes over And apologizes profusely. Super nasty. Super gross. Unless you enjoy flossing your teeth during dinner with another person's hair, I recommend you do not eat here.",
