There's a balcony with tables where you can sit and have a drink while looking out over the London skyline. Just amazing. EDIT: apparently it is at the discretion of the manager on duty if you are allowed to order drinks and sit outside without making a reservation. Pretty harsh I would say, especially since the place was empty when I went the second time! Drinks are slightly pricey, but its expected due to the prime location of the bar. They also have a brasserie and a restaurant offering food, but I had a quick peek at the menu and it was really pricey!",

I don't know if a better location with views of London exists. The in house catering and drinks were pretty awful. The drinks were either too strong or too sweet and I honestly witnessed full grown adults making faces after sampling the food. While the presentation of the canapes were amazing, the flavours were missing. \u00a0Luckily they do not require you to use the in house catering so the venue has potential to be just want you want!With the right lighting and setup of tables, dancefloors, food, drinks etc... this would be a great venue. They wont quote you a flat rate until they hear what you want to do and then will make you a custom quote for your event.",

    "text": "Although the Oxo tower is famous; most people just know it as 'that posh restaurant on the river', and I have to admit I'd never really thought about what it might actually be like to dine there. So when I ascended the lift to the 8th floor I was suddenly quite nervous about what to expect and wondered what kind of experience lay in store (you normally at least know what cuisine the restaurant serves before you go, I suddenly realised I didn't even know that!). Would the Oxo tower's reputation turn out to be just based on hype or would it be well deserved? Anyway, I shouldn't have worried; what a wonderful evening it was. Although the food was good, the service was faultless! The waiters seemed to know what I wanted even before I did. As they had been fore-warned of my wife's gluten allergy they even had gluten-free bread warming in the oven without asking! At over 30 pages, the wine menu is overwhelming and will have something for every palette (and almost every wallet with prices between \u00a330 and \u00a315000!!) and the sommelier is on hand ready to offer suggestions to match your meal if you are struggling. My fillet of beef may have been the priciest thing on the menu, but it was worth every penny as every mouthwatering morsel was exquisite and satisfying (the first time I'd had beef served with marmalade, but oddly enough it works). I didn't really have room for my 'chocolate plate' but I couldn't resist the quartet of mini-puds and although my waistline may have been wincing, somehow every bite was finished. Of course, the view is fantastic overlooking the city skyline at night, but it's not as great as it could be from within the dining area, but if you are brave enough; take your table out on the balcony area - just take a layer or two as it's rather breezy up there! At \u00a3180 for two including wine, it's not somewhere you can go every week, but everyone should go at least once especially if you've started questioning waiting service standards recently in London - let the staff at Oxo restore your faith!",

This building helped rejuvenate the Southbank along with Tate Modern and the now relocated Saatchi Gallery.The views for the 8th Floor are spectacular. The lights of London in the evening are beautiful. The little boats on the Thames creeping up and down with onboard parties, dinner groups or tourists sightseeing.As you enter the 8th floor you first walk into the bar and brassiere area which is linked by an exquisite terrace to the restaurant.The seating in the Bar and brassiere is very intriguing. Large awkward shaped moulded plastic chairs. Extremely comfortable but exaggerated forms.The restaurant furniture is much simpler with sophisticated yet minimalistic tables and chairs. The huge glass facade is truly the finishing touch to this experience.",

I first went there because I heard that it was free to get the lift up the tower and catch a great view of London, and it is an amazing view. They said it was free, and that was really clever, and the view is magnetising and you almost feel that you have to toast to the moment, hence, a trip to the bar to purchase a drink.There is a bar and restaurant, and since my first trip, I have been a few more times, it is somewhere to take family visiting from abroad or take a lady friend. I havent had anything in the restaurant, but as for the Bar, it is expensive, but everything comes with good service and great views. My last trip there, I was on the Cocktails, me and a friend stayed and around four each, that cost me \u00a350. Ok, its not cheap, but the view!!! I love it. If you arent afriad of heights, take a quick look from the outside balcony!!",

The views are the thing here and I've attached a couple that I took on my mobile so that you can decide for yourself. It was extremely busy when I went and our table was right next to the musicians. The music was obviously loud but, funnily enough, we didn't have a problem hearing each other and the conversation was not shouted out. The service was good. We never got into that situation where you're craning your neck desperately trying to get someone's attention and our waiter was particularly nice in advising me what I could do to indulge my smoking habit without having to trek all the way downstairs. Unfortunately, the food was a let down. It my be called Thai Fusion but really it was a hodgepodge of flavours that didn't neccesarily go that well together. I think we all agreed around the table that our main courses were okay but a bit disappointing. We spent about \u00a3200 between 5 of us for 2 courses each and 1 bottle of wine for the whole evening. However, with the good music, fantastic views and excellent service I would go again.",

(It really is a damn fine view.)Granted, a winter's evening isn't exactly the best time to en-jo-jo-jo-jo-joy the p-p-p-p-p-atio, but at least I didn't have to beat out the crowds that prevented me from gawking at the Thames and beyond on a lazy summer's night. Put your sparkle pants on, ignore the abundance of extra zeros you're bound to see next to each dish, and take it all in. What's life without a few splurges now and again, right?",

Having ordered cocktails, we weren't allowed to finish them before our starter arrived, while eating it the wine waiter began harassing us to choose wine for the meal. He then bought said glass of wine while we were still drinking our cocktails. Good Christ man! I thought. In olden times you would've been shot!The starter was very good- crab and passionfruit, but my main of duck was uninspired to say the least. Won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Getting to the Oxo Tower Brasserie was a bit weird. My sister, wife, and I walked here one night in October and everything between the London Eye and Oxo Tower was dark and pretty empty. We followed the map and got to a seemingly quiet high-rise residential area with closed shops on the first floor. We walked down an empty hall, and took the elevator up.What a difference. From the top floor, the view of London is simply amazing and the brasserie was bustling. When you get to the top, you'll see the brasserie to the left and the restaurant to the right. It kind of makes you feel cheap for going to the brasserie, but don't worry, the food is fantastic. We got a table close to the edge, so we had an awesome view the whole evening. The whole wall facing the Thames is glass. The layout of the restaurant is a large open room with a lot of tables and chairs. Still a bit (mostly business) casual, but definitely nice.I can't remember what we got, but it was all good. They even have good vegetarian options, but they're on a separate menu, so we had to ask. We ordered a Harvey Nichols Cab (Italian) and it has to be some of the best wine I've had. Too bad it's not sold stateside. However, a couple of other wines I had in Europe somehow weren't as good in the States. I think the ambiance, view, food, and service just make you a lot more receptive.At the end of the meal, we took some pictures on the balcony and closed the night. The prices are a bit steep, especially in USD. Particularly if you order alcoholic drinks, it is very easy to cross into 4-$ territory on the Yelp system. However, if you're a tourist and looking for a more upscale or trendy place for dinner, Oxo should be part of your list.",

Almost a bit of the upscale night club kinds of people. The ma\u00eetre d was extremely professional. The only complaint I had was the fact my duck was served a bit too over cooked and was a bit dry. But at this restaurant, you are paying for the name and view so I can't complain. The bill came out to \u00a3400 for 4 people, which isn't too bad. If you're looking for great views, and a young modern atmosphere, but could care less about quality of food, OXO tower is for you.",

I'm guessing that's why expectations are so high - put the view aside and this is just a standard good restaurant. Don't expect too much from it despite the presentation, Oxo is not in the Michelin guide. If you want to be blown away, go to a Robuchon or the like.The food was good, choices were a bit weird but my wife and I liked what we got. The wine list is impressive although it's overpriced even for a restaurant. There are a few rarities here, like a 1964 Louis Roederer in magnum form, and some choice Dom vintages. The bar is impressive as well, providing very well made drinks. The waitstaff was also doing well by us, providing good suggestions. Not the sort of seamless experience you'll get at a restaurant of Michelin Star caliber again, but good.I think we will return to mark having lived here 6 months, and see what it's like during the summertime.",

We met a bartender who was also from the States, which was a warm welcome. We had steak and a lobster dish and shared an appetizer and a bottle of wine. We also started with a cocktail each (two people). While everything was very good, the bill was about $300, which I thought was a little steep given that I wasn't blown away with the food. Don't get me wrong, I have no complaints about the food, I just didn't think it was worth quite as much as we spent. If I had a fatter wallet, I'd come here all the time. My point is, if you have some extra cash to blow at a restaurant, go to OXO Tower. If you're counting pennies, maybe hold off until you've saved up a bit.",

It was one of our first meals in London, so it was great to be so high and can see the London scenery! I was such a tourist taking pictures of the Girken, the London Eye, Big Ben and more. And the lunch was great too. I had duck two ways with bok choy and this was wonderful. There were a lot of textures with simple, yet delicious spices. My husband had the salmon which he enjoyed as well. Atmosphere was somewhat nautical and the service was great. My husband asked about an artwork on the wall and the waitstaff didn't know, but they googled and researched it so they can come back and provide the history and background. :)",

I love London at night as the evening sky makes all the horrid cranes and scaffold that never go away disappear leaving a flawless view.I've always been a fan of the OXO Tower not only for it's collection of great design shops but for the building and its nostalgia of a bygone era of the Thames.Right to the nitty gritty. My lovely boyfriend booked us for dinner at the restaurant (yes I'm very spoilt by him!) and he got a great deal on Lastminute.com for 3 course for \u00a330. Before going I had a look at the sample menu and overall it isn't as expensive as I thought it would be considering it's location. The staff are impeccable and the service is great. The whole meal was delicious but if I'm honest the main was a little small, beautiful to look at but I did find myself pining for a little more as I finished.The decor is uber trendy and again the view really makes this restaurant. I think I would definitely come back for cocktails and I would like to try the Brasserie. If you have overseas friends or family to take out in London this is \u00a0a good place to bring them for a slap up meal and good view.",

    "text": "We hadn't been here in years.In fact, the last time was when we were young. Back when going out for dinner was the start of the big night, not the actual big night itself.This time we had a seven year old in tow and had just been to the Tate Modern to wonder at the convergence of Art and Performance. It was lunch. And we looked forward to being home in time for The Cube and tucked up in bed by 10.It's Easter and it felt like a treat and we had enjoyed the Oxo tower and its beautiful views all those years ago. So we booked up and got into the Brasserie.Pleased to report, the only thing that's changed is the skyline that affords such a wonderful view of the centre of our great city. Last time we came, there was no Gherkin, no Shard, no mad building to the south with three giant fans at the top of it. Plenty more then to admire or get angry over depending on your point of this view. Table by the window, what more could you want? We had the Concrete monstrosity/marvel of the National Theatre to our west, the Old Bailey and St Paul's Cathedral over the river to the north, and if we turned a little more, the Gherkin, the Nat West Tower and all the other newbies just there to the East. Hundreds of years of history combined with all the modernity the City demands at the same time. And Old Father Thames bursting at the seams in the middle of it all providing a pause for breath from the breathtaking.Gaze at all this in buzzy but comfy smart surroundings with a pianist playing the grand piano and a singer accompanying with some of the old classics.The food almost seems irrelevant. Except it's not. It's never going to beat the stunning views and ambiance, but it gives it a damn good try. I had the quail. A Thai effort with crispy shrimps decorating the edge of the plate all the way round. I prefer my quail cooked a little more harshly but the whole thing was nonetheless lovely. The paw paw salad provided a tangy contrast. The missus had the lamb merguez sausages with the most delicious accompaniment of red pepper muhummara which I'm guessing is crushed nuts of some sort. it added a wonderful texture and flavour to a sausage that, again, could have been treated with a little less respect and maybe have bolder spicing too. The feta cheese added a richness that made this a real dish. Great start.For the main I ordered the cod simply because i saw the lady eat it on the table next to me and it looked so vibrant and crispy skinned and moist. And so it was when it came. Generous amounts of punchy mushroom and Jerusalem artichoke bathed in oodles of vibrant green herb sauce. Delicious.The missus had crab and saffron risotto. This I must say was a little disappointing. Chalky. rushed I suspect so the inside of the grain hadn't been touched by heat. Shame. The flavour was good but the chalkiness of the rice coupled with the sloppiness of the unabsorbed sauce wasn't pleasant to me.But ho cares. We didn't. We sat and marveled and soaked in the atmosphere while the boy tucked into very nice fish and chips and pretended to be interested in our little nuggets...\"the scales of justice they're called...that's the savoy over there, the only road where cars can drive on the right...\"etc etc.Service was prompt and friendly and the whole thing was rather a joy I have to say. It was far too cold to sit outside but there are tables on the balcony and on a clear warm evening this must be the most romantic and cool place to eat.I hesitate to use the phrase but this is a real 'destination restaurant'. But they don't take you for a ride because of that. Good food. Great atmosphere. Amazing views. An extremely robust 4 stars. A must for tourist and Londoner born and bred alike to tick off the list for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I had heard mixed reviews about the OXO Tower Restaurant and Brasserie but as it was somewhere I had always wanted to go (and we couldn't get in a Fifteen) we recently ended up in the Brasserie there for a birthday celebration. Our table was booked for 9pm (it was a slightly late notice evening out) and we arrived on the 8th floor after a very pleasant walk along the Thames passing the lovely Christmas market at Bankside and taking in the sights. There is a bar, brasserie and restaurant at the OXO Tower - all on the 8th floor and all owned by the Harvey Nicholls Group. A friend had recommended the brasserie as opposed to the more formal (and on a week night apparently quite corporate) restaurant. For the brasserie you head towards the bar and are greeted by very polite staff at the entrance, your coat is taken at the cloakroom and shown to your table. At first I was slightly disappointed by our table as although it was near the window we were directly next to one of the waiters stations and very close to other diners. However once sat down it was fine. The atmosphere in the brasserie was fantasic - although the decor and furniture can make it feel a little clattery -the chatter and live jazz pianist playing Christmas songs more than improved the mood. The service was a little slow to start with - I had heard about the vegetarian menu and wanted to look at it but a waiter was no where to be found for about ten minutes, and our starters came before our wine but this was nothing that bothered me too much. I ended up with both a starter and a main from the vegetarian menu (which is not as good as I had been led to believe - three dishes for starter and main, two of which were already on the normal menu). My starter was quite interesting (tofu with rice pancake) rather than amazing, but my brother said his (lamb shank gnocchi) was fantastic. The mains were lovely - with my only criticism being that my tortellini was covered in a thick shower of cress -I thought I was in the 80's for a moment. The real star of the show food wise was however the desserts - we shared a creme brulee and a cheese plate and both were out of this world. The wine (about \u00a322 a bottle but the house wine was cheaper) lasted us nicely and the bill came to a reasonable \u00a3109 for two people. The OXO Tower is a lovely place to eat - the views are stunning across the Thames, the atmosphere is wonderful especially with the Christmas music playing - the food wasn't the best I had eaten ina restaurant but the price was more than reasonable and the service adequate and without any major issues. I would recommend a trip here for an enjoyable, reasonably priced dinner for a special occasion - by no means is this the kind of place you would go for a week night meal (pizza express anyone?) but for my birthday celebration - it was perfect.",

Choosing the slightly cheaper brasserie, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday night, resulting in our initially being offered a small table for three (we moved after politely asking for a larger table). Service was prompt and friendly, the menu was predictable Conran and the dishes were true to their descriptions. As ever though, you cannot beat the view and even though the sky was overcast, as London lit up at dusk, all the downsides of Oxo melted away.",

The atmosphere is lively and the cocktail bar fun - with drinks placed on uplights at the bar. The food is very good. The one criticism I had was that it felt very crowded with tables too close together. This may be because it was the run up to Christmas and more tables had been added? Despite this, it is a restaurant/bar with the wow factor due to its location and is a great place to take somebody for a celebration.",

In fact if you don't opt for loads of alcohol then the bill for food is very reasonable given the excellent quality of food. You will need to book quite a few months in advanced, however you may be able to get a table for an early or late sitting if you fancy this. Sittings are in two hour shifts every quarter of an hour or so; you can phone or book on line. Before or after your meal (or both) head to the lively bar area and have a few cocktails, and why not take your cocktail out onto the balcony to get a few pictures of St Pauls or 'The Gerkin' as well as the sites along the Thames. .",

The waiter came to offer us bread rolls, he was distracted by another diner and left the bread basket on the table. My daughter helped herself to a roll just as the waiter turned round. He was extremely rude to my 16 year old , who was very embarrassed. It was supposed to be the start of a lovely day but this experience left us angry.

What can I say about that - well, I didn't get food posioning, and it tasted alright, but considering the cost I would have expected something a bit more, well, filling, more choice, something that tasted a bit better. Basically dont come here for the food. For the cocktails, yes, they're great (expensive, but hey cocktails usually are) for the view, yes it's great.

    "text": "OXO Tower features a high-end restaurant, brasserie, and bar. The restaurant is a lifestyle experience crafted by Harvey Nichols. A place to see and be seen.The OXO Burger is a luxury take on the burger featuring a bun loaded with poppy seeds + sesame seeds, pickles, Monterey Jack cheese, crispy bacon, caramelized onions, spring mix, and juicy beef. The blend of ingredients creates a very satisfying flavor, and the beef is pretty juicy and flavorful by itself. The flavor profile is well balanced. It manages to highlight each ingredient with a taste that changes from first bite to chew to aftertaste. This makes the burger a very exciting experience for the taste buds. It's hard to call any one ingredient stand out on this burger, but my favorites were definitely the bacon, onion, pickles, and cheese (I liked almost everything about this one). Compared to the best burgers in the world the only thing holding this burger from easily being near the top is the bun. The abundance of sesame and poppy seeds did not seem necessary, and the bun was a little dry. With the addition of a pillowy soft bakery bun to this burger it might be the best in London. If you need an afternoon drink, or a place to impress a date OXO Tower is the place to go. While you are there enjoying one of the best views in London also try one of the best burgers.",

The views of the river and St. Paul's are breathtaking! They have a great selection of drinks and food. The food menu does change relatively often.

Great view probably the best in London, and great attentive staff.The butter for their bread is excellent. It is very inviting and you will find yourself asking for more bread...-Chilli spiced pumpkin miso soup, soba noodles, tofu (7 pounds)* A mild tasting miso with very finely diced up pumpkin. Different but good-Japanese beef carpaccio, wasabi mayonnaise, teriyaki onions, shiso cress (11 pounds)*Very good light, but very flavorful beef carpaccio. The wasabi mayo adds a different element.-Sea bass, pumpkin fritter, bok choy, red curry sauce, coconut sambal (23.50 pounds)*Very flavorful because of the curry coconut. Very rich and damn good.-Charcoal grilled cajun bourbon marinated corn-fed chicken, slaw, crispy pancetta, barbecue sauce, corn bread (21 pounds)*I am not sure if this dish was suppose to be served warm - cold.. It is very tender and rich. Good chicken taste with a hint of char..-Twice cooked Maris Piper chips (3.75 pounds)*Disappointed in the advertised twice cooked chips. It was super soft in the middle of the chips. Steak cutIMPORTANT NOTE: OXo Tower has the Czech Republic beer - Budweiser Budvar - Very few places will serve that outside of Czech. It is a must order, and you can thank me later..",

All of us agreed that the starters were AMAZING! My favorite was the bresaola, don't think I have had anything to match it thus far.Now here are the negatives:- My friend was a whiskey fan and he ordered from the list we were given. \u00a0The waiter returned after 15 minutes to tell us that they had just ran out of the one he wanted. \u00a0He ordered a second, and guess what, after 15 minutes, we found out they had 'just' run out of that as well. \u00a0Third time it worked, and it got us off to a bad start. \u00a0No fault of the waiter, just a bad experience.- While everyone raved about the starters, everyone was unanimously unhappy with main and the dessert. \u00a0The flavor combinations were just jarring at times, and you had to have a drink to wash the taste off. \u00a0On the Middle Eastern Mezze, the falafel was simply lacking any seasoning (salt) and the spices were just not coming through. \u00a0The mint yogurt was lacking flavor as well, as I would not have guessed it had mint had I not read the menu. \u00a0- I had the raspberry and yogurt panacotta and the raspberry tartness was just so overpowering that the panacotta and the dessert-ly creaminess was completely lost. \u00a0Thank god I had water nearby.Overall, I WILL return for an evening and just have the starter and some drinks and leave. \u00a0Not risking it with the mains and dessert, not for the prices listed.",

I went for the pink lemonade complete with a touch of vodka to liven it up. It was nice and not too sweet. Priced at 6.50.. Very reasonable for central London.Food wise the menu lacked excitement.. It could definitely use work. Was slightly tempted by a black bean burger, but decided to just stick to cocktails.Great concept, will definitely visit again, but probably just for the cocktails and games.",

The great service stopped once we were seated.The drinks selection is great but nothing to rave about.However the views is what this this place is best for.We never tried any food but the restaurant side of the establishment was constantly busy.The only main downside is that its a little bit on the touristy side so I probably wont go again as i was not that impressed.",

With glass windows surrounding the restaurant, there really isn't a bad place to sit as all spots provide you with a vast view of the city.All of the staff was truly wonderful, making my grandmother and guests feel very comfortable and at home.The food was delicious! If trying the bread, I highly suggest the rosemary with a pat of butter. The rosemary isn't overpowering and butter has just the right amount of salt.I had their pork belly which was a nice portion, well cooked and beautifully plated. I also had the sea bass which was fresh and put upon a bed of crispy kale, octopus and chorizo. For dessert I ordered the sorbet of which the elderberry was my favorite (a flavor not readily utilized in NY food).The only things to comment upon other than there markable food and staff is that it can get particularly warm, and I believe my seat was near the heat source. \u00a0Also, while it's completely understandable, larger parties are limited to a particular menu. This limitation may keep you from experiencing other things on the menu you may have wanted to try. If you do go with a large party, those things can be added without issue.If you have something or someone special to celebrate, I highly suggest the Oxo tower when in London. It's great for large groups, but also serves well for romantic dinners and business meals.",

It's one of those \"posh\" places that people talk about, so we were really looking forward to it. The greeting area, the champagne and the view lives up to all one can expect, I can highly recommend it. For some reason we were not allowed to go out on the patio, even if that was clearly allowed on the patio next to it, the one they call brasserie - it was full of people. The strange rules and our desire to challenge the system gave us and some other guests the opportunity to play some fun games with the staff. \"Sir, you are not allowed to go out there!\". \"What?\". Sir, come back!\". (silence), \"Sir, I must insist that you and your party come back in\". \"Why?\" \"Sir, (deep sigh), we have been over this already, allow me to clarify...\". And so on. Good times. And the view is really good.The wine list is good, but the waiters seem to know nothing about grape-based alcoholic beverages. I asked for guidance in choosing a white, but all I got was \"This is Italian\". \"This one is from New Zealand\", etc. I have been able to read for many years, I'd even go so far as to call myself literate. So that was, well, literally no help.But I'd come back for the steak.",

The terrace is overlooking the river Thames and from there you can only hear the sound of the waves. It's so relaxing we actually forgot about the time... One star for the service : Beautiful service overall. I did not have to read the menu, the waiter took the time to explain it all beautifully. It was a if he was telling a story. The waiting time was reasonable. One star for the food : Everything was fantastic. As you can see from the pictures I uploaded, the presentation is sophisticated but simple. From starter to dessert, from champagne (as aperitif) to the wine, the entire meal was a dream. One star for the drinks : The sommelier was very helpful in finding us the perfect compromise. He advised us on a Pouilly Fuisse, white wine. Simply perfect, I highly recommend it. One star for the experience : The location, service, food, and drinks were top of the range. I could not have wished for a better place to have lunch on Sunday in London. The price reflects the level of service but still reasonable. A five star rating for OXO Tower Restaurant. If you have the chance, treat yourself for a one of a kind lunch :)",

When we got there, there was a sign saying it's been closed for a private event and that our reservation was for 9:45. Obviously something got messed up during the reservation process. So they sent us across the way to the other restaurant and we waited until they were able to accommodate us (about 9:20). The service was unbelievably SLOW. And forget about asking for some almonds to munch on they'll forget. We constantly had to flag down a waitress for drinks it seemed like we were being very neglected. When we were finally seated, it took over an hour for our appetizers to come out and almost another hour for our meals to come out which the steak was cooked to medium when my fianc\u00e9 asked for rare. We were there for over three hours. Not by choice. I got the duck which was very tender and delicious. The rum baba with coconut sorbet was AWESOME. If this place were a dessert place is given it 5 stars, but it's not. Overall it's a nice modern fancy restaurant with mediocre food, unbelievably slow service and a great view.",

    "text": "Never having been to South Bank before, I made a reservation at Oxo Tower for a Thursday night to try their Winter prix-fixe menu in the brasserie. Finding this restaurant was a scavenger hunt in itself since this whole area was under construction. When I finally saw the 'OXO' sign up on top of a building, I figured I must be at the right building. I wandered around a bit to find the lift and made my way up to the 8th floor. I was greeted very nicely by the host, they took my coat, and promptly walked me to my table which was right up against the glass. I had a lovely view of the Thames River, Blackfriars Bridge & St. Paul's in the backdrop. Absolutely stunning! My friend and I both went with the prix-fixe menu for 29.50. The names of the dishes are escaping me at the moment (sorry), but I can tell you the gist. For my starter, I had the onion soup with duck confit, which was very flavorful and quite delicious. I nearly licked my bowl clean because it was so good. My main, scottish cod, was cooked to perfection. My fish was flaky & tasted amazing, and wasn't heavy at all. For dessert, I had the apple pudding & custard. This was the icing on top... it was a great way to end my meal. I was basically in dessert heaven. My friend ordered different things where I only got to have a bite of: veal and beef ragout, linguine, and the rhubarb and vanilla brulee. I want to say that all of my choices were better based off the bites I had.The food is pretty good, but come on... everyone and their mums are here for the view. It's gorgeous & a very nice atmosphere to have a lovely dinner. It was my first time on South Bank in this area so it was nice to see the lights from this side of the Thames. I had a lovely time and the venue and the view is worth giving this restaurant a try.",

We went for a bit of a walk and arrived a little early. We had a seat on the patio in the bar area and had a drink there before being moved to our table which was also in the patio. My husband is very white and forgot his sunglasses, luckily the staff had him covered there and bought over a pair of glasses for him. He's still pretty sunburnt though! I ordered the crab to start, followed by the pork chop, hubby had the sucking pork to start followed by a steak. We got new potatoes and broccoli as sides also. All of the food was delicious and cooked well. Hubby's steak was a bit pinker than medium rare in the middle but he was fine wit that. Unbeknownst to me, they had previously arranged a birthday surprise for me! I came back from the bathroom and was presented with a very rich and decadent personalised chocolate cake for two (which actually feeds 4) with some cute little candles on it! They asked it we would like it served and the rest in a box which was very appreciated. It was far too big for 2 of us to eat! The service was impeccable but the one thing I will say is that it would have been great to have some light music playing outside. It was very quiet aside from people noise.",

Even the quintessential gloomy London days are beautiful as you get to see the River Thames and the city lights across the way after the Sun goes down, (which in London is early during the colder months).Reservations are strongly recommended, and do be prepared to splurge. The cocktails are amazing, though, and they always have something seasonal to put you in the spirit of whatever the time of year it happens to be. The portions are small, but fancy. And the staff is quite friendly.Maybe not the kind of place you visit on a weekly basis, but certainly worth a try at least once for a special occasion.

I might be wrong, I don't know.The Grey Goose Le Grand Fizz was great. You could barely taste the vodka unless they didn't put much in to begin with... Who knows. The bread and butter was also great. Aside from dessert, nothing was worth mentioning.Since there were four of us, we got different dishes for our starters and mains. Not one was delicious or even worth considering to get. Outside of their view, there isn't much to come here for.",

We started out with wine and a scallop appetizer that was beautifully plated. The scallops were delicious and seasoned so well. Our main courses were salmon and a filet. My salmon was cooked perfectly and my husband loved his filet. We had told them it was our anniversary and they gave us beautiful desserts decorated for our anniversary.

    "text": "One of the best things about living in London is the food - you can almost any kind of cuisine you fancy, and there are so many quirky, interesting places to discover. Despite dining out a fair bit, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what London has to offer.Of course, it was absolutely typical that when my Japanese family came to town last week, that I was in a massive panic. Despite the countless number of restaurants in London, I was rushing around like a headless chicken trying to find somewhere that was absolutely perfect.For the perfect meal, I required:1. A table for six at 7.30 on a Friday night (I began the frantic search on Wednesday afternoon)2. Delicious food3. A fantastic view of my favourite city looking its finestI found all three at the OXO Tower Restaurant. The OXO Tower has been an iconic London landmark since the '30s, but fell into disrepair until the Coin Street Community Builders, a social enterprise, gave it a new lease of life in the '90s, when the restaurant first opened.One of the first things to mention is the fact that the view is insanely good. St. Paul's Cathedral and the Thames in the summer is definitely a winning combination, which kept my extremely snap-happy family thrilled.The sommelier chose the wine for us - a lovely white (although I can't for the life of me remember what it was)! Needless to say all his choices were excellent (and mostly dry, the way I like it).For my starter, in honor of having my Japanese relatives around, I went for the marinated tuna with soy, mirin, sake and cucumber gel.It was beautifully presented, with subtle flavours, although I wasn't a massive fan of the cucumber gel (I'm not a fan of gels). My uncle went for the chilled melon and ginger soup, which was served with Innes sheep's curd, San Daniele ham, and a black olive parmesan grissini. I thought the choice was rather a brave one - probably not one I would have made. He really enjoyed it though, and liked the combination of flavours - the melon and ham in particular.My biggest regret of the evening was not ordering the starter my boyfriend had - the cured sea trout with baby cucumbers, purple potato blinis, samphire and eggs was really, really divine. The smokiness of the trout went so well with the freshness of the cucumbers and samphire, while the eggs gave it a stronger depth of flavour - it's on my list for next time.I opted for the veal sirloin for my main course, which was served with a courgette flower stuffed with ratatouille, baby artichokes and green tapenade. The veal was ever so slightly overdone for my taste, but the courgette and ratatouille was a triumph - something I want to recreate at home at some point!For some reason, everyone else went for the sea bass as their main, which was served with garlic gnocchi, enoki mushrooms, ice lettuce, almond, and sorrel.They were onto something though, as they seem to really excel at the seafood dishes at the OXO Tower Restaurant. The sea bass was cooked really well, and the rest of the dish tied things together beautifully - the nuttiness of the mushrooms contrasted nicely with the rest of the dish.The meal was slightly let down by the rather odd assortment of desserts. Although presented nicely, my dessert of sour cherry cream served with almond tuile and macarons seemed to be thrown together randomly, and didn't do anything for me. I would've been happy with a larger macaron, and without the odd sour cherry cream altogether.My boyfriend got the raspberry and pistachio pannacotta, which was also presented a bit strangely - in my opinion, the best desserts are always the simplest, and I felt that they may have overcomplicated things by making it more arty rather unnecessarily.Overall, it was a lovely evening, and I couldn't have picked a better place for a stunning meal in London. It's worth even just going to the bar for a drink alone, and my guests really enjoyed it, saying it was the best meal that they had in London. The simple, subtle and uncomplicated flavours were a really big hit, and really suited their palate.The experience was slightly let down by the desserts, but other than that it was a fantastic meal and I'd definitely be going again!",

Then it felt like this secret luxury restaurant but hey, was somewhat younger then!Little has changed here from what I recall. Lots of tables crammed in so, wouldn't pick here for a quiet romantic meal. Doesn't really have a dress code. Some people were dressed up looking like they were celebrating something whilst others looked like they had dropped in after shopping. That being said, the restaurant staff were very friendly. We were greeted with a summer cocktail and managed to get a table by the window. We had a set meal menu so not a lot of selection but what we had was very nice. The fish was well cooked well and portion size didn't leave me still hungry. The house wine was fine so don't feel you have to splash out on the more expensive bottles. Bar is at the end of the restaurant so noise levels continue in this area. It does close, what seems to be early. On asking if we could have a drink, the answer was 'no'!! \u00a0 \u00a0she did go on and explain why.. There is a great view and you can get out into the balcony for the obligatory selfie!!",

The restaurant was virtually empty apart from our group but the service was still painfully slow and the waiting staff seemed more interested in getting us to order more wine than in actually providing any sort of service. As we were a large group we were limited to a set menu of 3 choices of starter, main course and dessert. The choices weren't great - for example, two of the starters involved smoked fish - and none of the starters or main courses were suitable for non-fish eating vegetarians (though the restaurant had been told a week before than 2 of the party fell into this category). There was then a bit of a scene as the waiter insisted that he couldn't substitute a vegetarian dish from the a la carte menu which meant that we had to get the restaurant manager involved. Even he took a bit of convincing to let the vegetarians order something off the set menu (rather than just sit and watch the rest of us eat presumably). The food itself was fine, but very much of the style over substance school which looked wonderful but was in small portions, the taste of which didn't live up to how it looked. There are great views, yes, but it really isn't enough to make up for the poor experience we had there. Certainly wouldn't go again and wouldn't particulary recommend that anyone else does either.",

I know it's a cliche and you've heard it before about the better the food, the smaller the portion. But I honestly didn't feel that was the case. Firstly, there was a single vegetarian starter and main meal - I mean come on! The food was nice, but I'd much rather have had a portion of local chip shop chips just to feel satisfied. Apparently if you get a seat by the window, the view is amazing, but expect a few months wait if you want those (ok so maybe the recession might go a little in your favour). Overall, the restaurant was nice - a little too posh for my liking, although I didn't feel out of place (except that my boyfriend was mortified that I was drinking beer from a bottle - the only way to drink bottled beer in my mind, unless you have a frosted glass from the freezer) Its very pricey, so get your man to pay :)",

    "text": "It was by complete surprise that I ended up at The Oxo Tower Bar on a summers night, but then, unplanned nights are often how the best evenings start, aren't they? I had met up with two guy friends of mine from Manchester. They wanted to see London through a tourists eye. They had looked up at the distinctive red cross marking the Oxo Tower on the South Bank and decided that was the place to go. I was hesitant; I didn't realised that the bar was completely separate from the restaurant, so that you could drink without having to eat (and the restaurant is very expensive). But the bar is pretty much an entity of its own. The place was buzzing, packed with a complete mix of individuals. A live jazz band was playing (they play on most nights). The cocktail menu was sublime. It ran through classics, giving a few unexpected twists to some. Many were champagne cocktails, others were house specialities.While they were not cheap (between \u00a39.00 -\u00a312.50), I felt that the cost was justified when we took our drinks outside onto the large terrace bar. I would have paid any money for this view. It simply stops you in your tracks. Sweeping across London, with St Paul's staring back at you, this is one of the best places to stand with a drink in your hand. I could have stayed here all night. My drinks were going down a treat. Let me recommend to you the Lychee and Rose Petal Martini, and the Apricot Champagne Cobbler. \u00a0But alas, all perfect evenings must eventually end, but that doesn't mean they can't be recreated again.",

We were seated at the far end of the restaurant, which isn't overly big and were presented with a wine book the size of a small encyclopaedia. Prices were not that extortionate for the house red so we opted for that and were not disappointed. We all ended up opting for the steak but the chef was obviously not sure what rare meant as all arrived medium to well done.very disappointing but luckily a good cut of beef. Service wasn't as fast as we expected after being told they needed the table back by 9:30pm. The only exceptional service was from the sommelier who obviously knew his job. The meal was the most expensive I've had but not the best (Michael Caines rocks). We had to catch someone's eye to request the bill. She proceeded to roll her eyes at us even though we were trying to be helpful. They never asked if we wished to pay the service charge, just automatically took if off a card even though we said we had cash for it. Disappointment all round, we did have words with the restaurant manager and they waived the service charge..he knew the girl in question and tried to fob us off that she was knew. Just not good enough. One and only visit from us all.",

I wasn't holding my breath for a great night. For starters, this was a hen night and (in my limited experience) I usually spend the most part of those trying not to cringe and attempting to look like I'm having fun. In addition, I prefer the low key to the high flying - but up I went in the little lift and into the fray. The bar was incredibly busy - I didn't appreciate the warbling live singer and I was indignant that to get to the bar I had to elbow hoardes of overdressed photograph taking punters out of the way. When I got my mojito, it wasn't out of this world and the service was only bearable. In the brasserie for food, we were squidged into a sideways arranged table - considering this place was picked for its view, all I could see was b2b's mother-in-law to be and a whole case of Harvey Nicks merchandise. When my thai prawn soup came, all was almost forgotten. It was thick, creamy and delicately flavoured, not overpowered by heat. Followed up by a huge plate of delicious guinea fowl and a lemongrass and coconut creme brulee (which tasted offputtingly like my starter) I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of the food and smiling service we received. The bill was exorbitant though and I just didn't think OXO was worth the dollar.",

    "text": "One mustn't allow having a really ace time with a good friend who, having just split up from her boyfriend and wanting to drink good cocktails, get rosy-faced, and end up staying until the early hours listening like teenagers to an ipod, one ear each, whilst ploughing through our second bottle of fine Harvey Nic's wine, laughing dorkishly one minute and having a demonstrably angry argument about how silly the Green Party is (one that ended with clinked glasses and giggles) the next, missing the last train home, and not really caring about being a bit excessive when ordering rather expensive dishes and lots of them, to mar an otherwise objective review of a well-known brasserie \u00a0but it's really hard for it not to. \u00a0 Sorry, stupid sentence alert. I had always avoided this place, having been told by a friend of a friend that it was overpriced and overhyped. A great lesson: don't trust friends of friends. I'm addicted to being up high in London. I mean, overlooking our amazing city \u00a0especially at night. Hence it was a real treat to spend a good five hours up there with a table right next to the expansive glass viewing walls. The brasserie is spacious, airy, and high. The view you see whilst dining overlooks the South Bank of the River Thames, and you can also see in the opposite direction (i.e. South London) whilst sitting at the bar. (Although it's not as good.) The bar is lit up all blue; kind of tacky but it went perfectly with the Mojitos and Ceviche spoon samples we ordered and ate at the bar before the meal. How Miami. (See my photo.) The deal was two Mojitos and 4 Ceviche spoons for \u00a325: classic Latin American spoons of raw fish, salsa, onions \u00a0pack the same punch that oysters do but without the oysterishness. Before we knew it, a waitress had seated us at our table and brought our drinks over. Oh, and the barman offered to take our photo. I actually agreed. This is unbearably tacky, but I went for it and it felt brilliant. We were two Londoners, in London, behaving like complete tourists. The waiter came out to ask if we enjoyed the Ceviche Spoons. We did. The service was superb; friendly, knowledgeable, polite. Front of house were lovely. The waiter, when asked to flip a coin on our behalf, he smiled and obliged. The tables were packed close together, but it didn't matter because we waited for a good table by the window. I would advise doing this too. Why come to one of London's best haute-cuisineries (haute as in high-up) and not wait a few minutes to get a good table where you can take-in those breathtaking views? Apparently you can dine al fresco on the spacious veranda during summer. I'm really looking forward to going back in summer. The food was all great, everything was done beautifully. From a serious foodie point of view, there was nothing progressive or inventive enough to blow me away, but this is fine dining, not Heston. What I did expect was horribly overpriced wine. The kind where you spend \u00a330 and get a bottle of crud. Gladly the wine list is good, and although I'm sure the markup is high, it's not nearly as horrific as many London pubs that charge you literally \u00a325 for some bottle of bile that would cost \u00a32.50 at Tesco, if they even sold the stuff at Tesco, which they don't otherwise these damned restaurants and pubs would get found out for being the wine-trafficking criminals and pimps that they are. No, the wine we drank was decent, the list had neither a pinot blush nor the standard array of underwhelming New World wines in sight. Good. The Thai crab cakes (a bit yawnish, I know) tasted like really superb Thai crab cakes, actually. The duck breast was a bit fatty, but everything around it was prepared and presented to perfection. In a fit of mild gastronomic rebellion, we decided upon french fries. Damned brasseries. I honestly don't remember what the desert was, but I think it involved a lot of chocolate, another bottle of wine, and some espresso, which was actually recognisable as espresso. Good good. I heartily recommend this lovely brasserie. Go at night, go on a whim, book 10 minutes before you turn up, drink some good stuff, enjoy the gorgeous views and the classic steel and glass styling of this bustly brasserie.",

It can't have been that good because I can't remember what I ate, and it was only last October! The views are ok, but not the best to be had in London. The service was ok but unexceptional. Another table got served before us even though we had arrived way before them which irritated me a bit. What annoyed me most was the way the tables are crammed into the small space. It's probably better if you are part of a group of 4 or 6, but there were just two of us eating. The table next to us was only a few inches away (they were right by the window - we weren't) and there was absolutely no privacy. As it happened though, hearing every word they were saying became quite amusing - they started having an argument because the woman wanted to go on holiday and the man was too busy and didn't need a holiday anyway. Then, after their meal, things came to a head and the woman stormed out of the restaurant, with her bloke hot on her tail. They only left a small bag on the table so we were speculating that this was a ruse to avoid paying for dinnerbut eventually the man returned alone to pay up.",

Normally I'd say no but there is one exception...::::: 5th of November :::::Book your table now. I was lucky enough to have my sister figure this one out one summer and 3 months later we were sitting eating rabbit and drinking wine at 8 pm with a grandstand view of London's best fireworks, north and south.My genius sister.",

    "text": "After seeing a small logo on the right hand side of our Yelp pages, saying \"Yelp now in the UK\", I was truly thrilled! It has been bloody ages since I lived and worked in the UK but it left an indelible and remarkable impression upon my soul. It was New Year's Day 2002 and my fellow work mates and I, from the Old Trout Inn in Thame, Oxfordshire, decided to continue our debaucherous NYE with a trip to fancy London town for a fabulous lunch and drinks at the Oxo Tower. Obviously, I will never forget the incredible view from the atop the Tower, a sprawling metropolis divided by the river Thames. Our lunch was spliced with numerous bottles of fantastic wine and soon we realized it was no longer lunch time, but time to move to the bar. I had heard such fabulous fables of the Oxo Bar that I simply stared in awe at the gorgeous staff and massive, endless drink menu. In order to decide upon drinks, we simply closed our eyes, flipped a page and pointed. Thusly, as the night wore on, so did our ridiculous behavior. I remember ending the night singing Frank Sinatra and swearing to myself that I would always remember this incredible New Year's Day.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch in the brasserie and came away with mixed feelings about the place. The welcome and service from the maitre d' was excellent. The service from the waiting staff less so - it was polite enough but very slow and of variable quality. We were there a good 5 minutes or so before asked if we wanted anything to drink, and another 15 minutes before the food order was taken. We were also offered bread only once, while a table near us with a different waiter was offered bread several times. When will restaurants realise how much revenue they're missing out on because people have to skip dessert and coffee due to the slow service? The food also varied in quality. My linguine and anchovy starter was poor \u00a0the pasta was overcooked, the anchovies undercooked, the arrabiatta sauce lacking any zing. On the other hand, my main course of saltimbocca chicken was excellent. The chicken was cooked perfectly so it retained a lovely juiciness. Despite the excellence of the main course, I feel that the food here is overpriced. I don't mind paying good money for consistently well-cooked high quality food. The Oxo Tower, unfortunately, doesn't have the consistency or quality to justify its prices. If you come here, just remember that you're paying for the wonderful view and location, not for top-notch food.",

The food is simply awful: the sort you'd expect to get in an airport lounge or from a mediocre caterer and certainly not up to London standards. Drop by and have some mineral water or something else bottled (the mixed drinks suck too) and take a look at the view --and leave. London is so packed with great food that there's simply no reason to waste more time than that here.",

Nice to pay modest prices for food and also NOT to be gutted by the prices of wines. Wines again very modestly priced. Its often a case of you get what you pay for (Or you hope it is) i think all balanced up, good food, fair prices, nice environment and good staff, well worth a visit. I Like the Oxo tower, it's as simple as that.",

Service is efficient and full of smiles. And the view, well, c'mon ... it's spectacular. On my last visit, I slid in on a Friday night with wife and friends for a post-theatre meal. Everywhere else we tried was packed (or closed for renovations). I was surprised to find an available table here. I'm not sure if we just got lucky or if the accommodating staff went the extra mile to help us out. Either way, we had a good meal.",

It was a sunny (and actually rather hot) day in London so we were able to sit outside where the views are stellar. The food is delicious if a bit ... small. The portions are incredibly tiny and the food is quite expensive, but if you're looking for a nice night out and aren't worried about spending, it's a great place to check out! Definitely sit outside if the weather's nice!",
