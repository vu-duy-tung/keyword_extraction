Even better in the cold winter months. Brilliant.",

    "text": "After hearing so many good things about this place from friends and reviews we decided to give it a try. We got here just after 7pm on a Thursday evening - it was unbelievably busy! We were lucky to get a standing spot in a corner by one of the bar tables (there were hardly any seats). Between the 4 of us, we shared - meatballs, padron peppers, 2x tomato bread, patatas bravas, prawns, veg stew, tortilla, ham croquetas, squid. The best dish was the squid...the rest were OK. There were just too many people in such a tiny space, and on a warm evening, it got to the point where it was almost unbearable as there is no A/C or any ventilation at all other than the door that was left open. We had to finish our food quickly and breathed a huge sigh a relief the moment we left the bar and had some fresh air.",

    "text": "Neighbours. Everybody needs good neighbours...or so they say on Ramsey St. And it's no different here on Bermondsey St, with the latest addition to the already thriving foodie neighbourhood (Zucca and Garrison are both on the same street) - we welcome Jos\u00e9; a Sherry and Tapas bar co-owned by ex Brindisia Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro and Herv\u00e9 Durochat, formerly of Hakkasan and the Soho House Group. The food menu is concise with the usual suspects like Tortilla, Patatas Bravas and Jamon Ib\u00e9rico, along with a daily changing market-menu (the specials), dependent on whatever is fresh at the market that morning. We ordered the special of grilled sardines (\u00a35), and pork neck (\u00a38), served medium rare instead. Both were incredibly tasty, simply cooked with a drizzle of olive oil, yet perfectly seasoned. The Patatas Bravas (\u00a32.50) were quite possibly the best I've had..definitely in London anyway. Crispy on the outside and gorgeously fluffy on the inside, served with a fresh, heavenly dollop of aioli on top. The Jamon Ib\u00e9rico croquettes were good, but at \u00a36 for some peque\u00f1as bolas, I could have easily gone without. The vibe is great though. Buzzing, yet cosy, reminiscent of the tapas bars in Barcelona's La Boqueria markets. The arrival of Jos\u00e9 to the neighbourhood is perfectly timed, especially for the summer months ahead. Get there as soon as you can! Ol\u00e9 For full review and pictures, please go to gourmetbelly.wordpress.c\u2026",

    "text": "We'd finally hit summer. Friday night spent lolling outside the pub and a perky Saturday of sun and fun with walks wearing shirt and no jumper. A continental day ended appropriately with a hoped for but unscheduled aperitif stop in Bermondsey tapas joint du jour Jose. Owned eponymously by Jose 'Brindisa' Pizarro and garrulous business partner front of house expert Herve, it's finishing the job that neighbour (and final dinner destination) Zucca kick started and making Bermondsey, Street at least, a real foodie destination. I have a slight problem with tapas restaurants out of their native environments, and it's that you can't crawl. The joy of tapas for me comes with a gleeful bowl around the neighbourhood and a bite and a glass in each joint. Moderation, exercise and a pub crawl in one. With a little help from Herve, we may have cracked it. Prior to dinner and after a long warm walk, I was ready for a glass of something dry and crisp and cold. I steered us into Jose, keen to have a gander. The white tiled space focussed around the marble slab bar feels uncharacteristically out of place in South London, the heat emanating from it even more so. A combination of the small room, a large stove surrounded by Jose and his brigade, no air con and a sunny day meant I nearly lost the others at the first hurdle. The place was packed, no more than 25 in there, but it's enough not to want to be there when it's busier. No reservations means that like Spuntino you're going to have to come early, or be prepared to wait. As Herve explained, they're not aiming for the (London) bridge and tunnel crowd but hoping to add something to a great little local scene prior to opening larger restaurant Pizarro later in the year.I sucked down deliciously dry sherry while we gorged, an early doors licensing quirk meant no booze without food, on a couple of the delicious tapa from behind the counter. We grabbed a couple of plates judging they would suffice as starters. Sea fresh boquerones, juicy white anchovies, came in a light and sweet seasoned cava vinegar, Murcian speciality pisto, a simple full flavoured Spanish version of ratatouille, came with a perfectly fried duck's egg. Giant yolk flecked with salt looming over the the plate reminding us of the late spring sun. Despite the specials board (cruelly featuring crab and basil croquettes the next day) you'd struggle to make a full meal out of the place, but that's partly the point. Grab a couple of plates, and move on. We admitted to Herve that we were going on to Zucca for our mains; \"there you go then! There's your tapas crawl.. start here, mains at Zucca and then on to Village East for a cocktail or dessert.\" Tapas crawl, Bermondsey style.",

    "text": "What does Tapas mean to you or to anyone? Small plates of food served with a drink? It's not just the food. Obviously the food is good. For me, it's the food and everything else that goes with. If you have been to Spain, You will tend to notice, how the Spaniard just sit around with vin and cervecas and their tapas, chatting away with no worries of everything that's happening around them.I always been a great lover of cultures who sits down and spends time to enjoy the food and the company they are with. It saddens me something that we do not have this culture in London. Even in Asia, even how very over productive they are, time is essential for making money. They still take time to have their lunches. A proper lunch at most time with friends or even just on their own. In London, having an hour break seems a sort of guilty pleasure that you're forbidden to enjoy.I want to introduce, one of my favourite tapas places in London. The food is good, but what I like about it is, it feels I just stepped into a tapas place in Spain. No reservation says Jose. Yeap, Jose's tapas bar. This little tapas place in Bermondsey brings me back to times good times in Spain. Wine barrels as table tops, simple tapas dishes, and all good Spanish wine by the glass. I went to Jose yesterday, had a few tapas and drinks over long chats on a summer's day (in London). It was perfect. Simple Spanish food and culture. A good way to experience Spain in London. I highly recommend Jose for exactly what I said. SIMPLE SPANISH CULTURE!!!thehungrybea.com",

    "text": "After many months of waiting we finally got round to making a long overdue visit to Jose on Saturday. Having walked past the tiny corner bar many times, and seen the crowds hopefully waiting for a bit of space to free up inside, we were well aware that we would need to arrive early if we wanted to avoid queuing in the snow. We turned up just before 6pm and were lucky to get a couple of stools by the window facing Morocco Street. If you haven't had the pleasure of visiting Jose it's probably worth pointing out that this is a bar not a restaurant and it's more than likely that you will be spending your evening propping up the bar or a strategically placed barrel. The sherry list looked very inviting and after a bit of chat with the friendly and informative staff we started our evening off with a glass of the Manzanilla Pastrana for me and the Puerto Fino for B. When combined with a plate of hot, salty padron peppers this is possibly the perfect way to get the appetite up and running. The menu covers all the tapas classics and is supplemented by an ever changing selection of daily specials chalked up on a blackboard behind the bar. The prices are pretty reasonable and there is plenty to stimulate even the most jaded of palates. We had a good run at both the daily specials and the normal menu; ordering a couple of plates at a time and then adding a few more later. If there are only two of you eating it's quite easy to get carried away and seriously over order!!! Stand out dishes were the sweet chilli prawns which were just divine, the hake with allioli and some very tasty meatballs. The wine list was well put together with plenty of good things to drink without breaking the bank. We had a bottle of the Casa Maria Verdejo (\u00a318) which went down very well and was a good accompaniment to the fish dishes. By the time we were thinking about dessert it was after 8pm and London's first snow of the year was coming down thick and fast. Bermondsey Street was looking very picturesque, but sensing looming trouble with the rail network we decided to make a hasty exit well pleased with a lovely evening at Jose and vowing to come back for a long lunch next month. Highly recommended for both the food and quality of service.",

A popular Tapas bar that has been recommended by many critics and foodie alike. As it is located in Bermondsey, which is not too far from us. This is perfect. First impression upon approaching the bar is that this is, without a doubt, a Tapas bar. It occupied a tiny corner of the street. From the outside, A charming, mahogany exterior with fuss-free decor. It was so subtle that we nearly walked past it without knowing. Once entered, we were immediately transport into a cosy, slightly Hispanic ambiance. The decorative tile, juxtaposed with exposed brick walls and the industrial steel pillar and beam. Wooden flooring and ceiling and a strategically place wooden barrel complete this unassuming bar. The exposed kitchen is a welcome feature. The aroma exudes from it when the chef were cooking were simply intoxicating. It was already busy when we got here at around 2 o'clock. The buzzing crowd further add to this sociable Spanish charm. We were first ushered to the table right by the kitchen where we had to stand by the friendly matron'd but a couple paid up and left while we were pondering on the menu. So we were swiftly moved to the corner where the much sought after stools were available. We ordered a selection from the menu as well as a few from the chalkboard behind the bar. This apparently are the daily specials that changes everyday according to what's fresh and available in the market. The wine arrived not long after. The red Decenio Cranza Rioja was an excellent choice. It was oaky and fruity, with a light liquorice and perhaps vanilla aftertaste. Read more on feasttotheworld.com/2012\u2026",

Besides Roman coffee bars and Danish smorrebrod, the standing room-only, Spanish tapas bar is a must. And while I wait for these things to never happen, I'm so happy I can find it here. Because, ya know, schlepping to Spain for tapas isn't always feasible... if I could export Europe's close geographical quarters to the US, I would do that, too. The food is traditional with small plates of patatas bravas, boquerones, and croquetas all being worthy of a try. I also really enjoy the Iberico ham selection. I haven't partaken in any of the sherries yet, as I can't help but gulp down the ice cold, Andalucian staple, Alhambra cerveza that they keep on tap. It makes a great date spot, if only for the fact that the crowding gives you an excuse to stand (what would be considered uncomfortably close in other settings) to the other person. For a little more privacy try to angle for a spot at the counter on the windows. And while it's not a great area for overall entertainment, it is a nice walk up to Tower Bridge in the evening. Now if only I didn't have to come all the way from West London to enjoy it!",

En route to Logan Airport at 5 am for an early flight to London, I shot a friend I hadn't seen in years a Facebook message to see if she was still living in the UK and could possibly meet. She replied that she'd be going on holiday, but could meet for dinner on my first full day in London. Despite jet lag followed by a 9-hour work day, I offered to travel far and wide to her favorite restaurant to get the best experience possible. This was the girl who taste-tested every single Maredo location in Berlin with me and made the hour U-bahn ride to my favorite czech beer garden so I could eat unidentified meat when she was still vegetarian. But, I digress.One of my friend's favorite dining spots in Bermondsey is Jos\u00e9, a tiny, dimly-lit tapas restaurant where you often eat standing up since there are maybe 8 seats at the bar. I'd guess the capacity of the whole place is 40. I was super starving after eating only a pret sandwich and dessert bar all day, but agreed that starting with a beer then splitting a bottle of wine with her and her husband was a good idea. We then proceeded to order a handful of small plates--a fatty meat and some fish dishes come to memory. It was kind of a blur, but the food was all good. Oh yeah, there were some chili-soaked prawns. Yum. What I really remember was dessert--a shot glass of a salty chocolate fudge with olive oil. Go to Jos\u00e9 for that, if nothing else. So good.",

I turned up about 20 minutes after my dear friend, who was bodily holding a seat for me! To their credit, although the place was packed and a line forming outside, the staff were happy to let him sit and drink and take up two stools until I arrived. They even then sorted out a little tussle that I had to have with another customer over who should have custody of said stool! They gave her another place and we were both happy. The menu is written up on boards behind the cooking area - where you can see all that goes on with the preparation of your food. I like that! I'm not germaphobic at all, but I do like a nice clean kitchen! As always happens with tapas we ordered loads and then realised that we had gone overboard when we thought we had finished and even more turned up! They were brilliant about the timing - only giving us a couple of plates at any one time. We had: Tomato bread (actually very crusty bread soaked in tomato juice. very flavourful.)Iberico ham (deep colour and flavour, absolutely stunning, went very well on top of the bread)Croquetas (not my cup of tea - too creamy inside, but my friend LOVED them!) Hake (actually a bit like an upmarket bit of chip shop fish)Clams in white wine sauce (beautiful!)Prawns in chilli (HUGE! More like small lobsters in chilli!) And the best red wine I have had in quite a while! It was absolutely scrummy! This was enough to completely stuff two people with usually very healthy appetites! For the record, the wine (three glasses!) I had was the 2009 Juan Gil SIlver Label, Monastrel, Jumilla at 8.5 quid a glass. That's more than I usually like to pay, but it was worth it. Recommended by the rather sexy waiter, it was the perfect red wine to accompany tapas. It was smooth, fruity and delicious. I think I have found my new favourite little place in Bermondsey!",

The food also stands up. The Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico is great, the tomato bread is delicate and the meatballs were amazing with the spicy tomato sauce. Another highlight was the grilled Chorizo. So overall food was really good. The wine wasn't the best, there is some room for improvement there. A negative point are the prices. Tapas cost around \u00a3 8 in average. In total our bill for 2 with only two glasses of wine came to \u00a3 85 with tips. For the type of location and the food this seemed a bit steep, even for London.",

    "text": "Tapas time! I love me some tapas as it's a great excuse to order lots of different dishes without looking moronic. Add to that some wine or sherry and you've got a winner.I've been wanting to go to Jose for ages since a) it's just up my street, and b) the smells coming for it have been mouthwatering. Unfortunately, it always seems to be rammed after work or for most of the day on the weekend. Luckily, we were told we could head off around 2pm on the 23rd (some benefits for working over the Christmas season when most of London has gone) so when I got a text about lunch from Tracy L, I immediately opted for this little cosy place.As it was pretty empty, we immediately were seated at the bar type area. First strange thing: they don't do tap water, only still or sparkling from their fancy filter system. It's not expensive, but just a bit odd when you ask for tap water and they say they don't have taps. Go figure.We started with pardon peppers, chilli garlic prawns, and squid in a garlic aioli. To whet our whistle so to speak, we were recommended a pale manzanilla sherry. The pardon peppers were perfect with large crystals of sea salt enhancing their otherwise mild flavour. They retained \u00a0bit of crunch and went down a treat. The chilli garlic prawns were massive and perfectly cooked although I felt the marinade was a bit lacking in depth. The squid in garlic aioli with a green chilli sauce was fantastic and I could have happily eaten just that. In fact we asked for extra bread to dip into the sauce and kept munching away. The sherry was a bit of a let down with a flat flavour and was a lot drier than I expected. It was more a dry white wine than anything sherry-like.The rain was pounding down, so we opted for another glass of sherry (this time recommended by a very flirtatious waiter) which was a oloroso sherry which was darker in colour and more on the sweeter side. This was far better (to my tastes) as it had a rich slightly chocolatey taste with a dark red fruit (think ripe plums) body and a lingering sweet after taste. To go with our food, we tried a plate of their Iberian ham. Contrary to most ham plates, this was heavy on the fat which was a bit too slick to eat easily although the ham itself was rich and flavourful with the sought after sharp meaty taste.Finally, no epic meal would be complete without dessert, and a chocolate pot seemed just the ticket. This was phenomenal. I'm not stranger to chocolate and have been known to devour whole dessert menus in a single sitting. The Spanish version of the chocolate pot (at least as far as Jose is concerned) is less rich and bitter than the French chocolate pot and runs more towards a mousse consistency. This one was silky smooth, creamy, with heavy drumbeats of dark tied nicely with the melody of milk. It was so good Tracy and I fought to scrape the bowl clean. In hindsight we should have just ordered another one.The place is a tad pricey with our feast for two running around \u00a360-70. But I suppose given the quality and location it isn't that unreasonable.Jose has just opened a new restaurant on the street called Pizarro. Guess where I'll be eating next?",

It can get busy but even if there is a queue out the door (as they don't take bookings), don't let that put you off as the staff are great at managing the space. \u00a0Jose is the more informal restaurant with Pizzaro (just down the road) the more formal one. \u00a0But the food is great at both and so it's really down to what sort of atmosphere you want. \u00a0Jose is a bit more lively as it's more bar like.",

And there's a lot of pretentious, snooty tapas bars in London and that's not what real tapas are about. It's the low-key, friendly atmosphere and vibrant, energetic bustle that make a tapas bar great, and Jose is all that. We went on a Friday evening and it was really packed. So we waited for seats to free up by standing, and eventually we started ordering because inevitably you get hungry as the wait can be very long (but that's how they do it in Spain, so I shouldn't be complaining). Everything was delicious. The quality was impeccable.The wine selection also went very well with the food... we got a bottle and finished it pretty quickly. And it's great to stand/sit by the large windows and gaze out onto the humble streets of Bermondsey. But the bill was not as humble (unlike Spain) so can't go here all the time, but was definitely a great experience!Note that you cannot add tip on your card so be prepared to bring some cash so you can properly tip the waiters.",

Food consisted of bread and oil, tomato salad, clams and morels. There was a slight slip with out order as we had actually ordered razor clams but got clams but was not a problem. The food was moreish and simple.

Going in here with my friend it was not at all what I expected, an intimate bench with just enough room to fit your food and wine on was a smart choice instead of tables to make the most of the limited room in a very small restaurant. The staff are very good at getting to you and getting your food quickly. The tapas here is incredible. We ordered the omelette, chorizo, pumpkin, the filet of beef. These were all incredible It makes me want to go back this week. I also had a very special bottle of Spanish Rose which turned out to be very good indeed.",

The food is impeccable. We ordered a large amount of food for two - patatas bravas, chorizo with toast, iberica pluma, tortilla, razor clams etc. Although everything seems simple and easy to make - iberica pluma's seared pork, and the razor clams were topped with chorizo, every dish was packed with flavour. My favourites had to be the chorizo and the razor clams - surprisingly not too heavy, and so addictive. The tortilla is a massive slice of potato-eggy goodness. Yum.One downside though was that the pork was drowning in olive oil. I love olive oil, but \u00a0the pork was literally sitting in a pool of olive oil...not exactly appetising but the pork was really really good. During peak hours it's definitely packed and you'll find yourself pushing/being pushed around a bit, but that's all part of the atmosphere of a tapas bar! Definitely one of the best places in London for tapas. Bermondsey's a real food heaven.",

What a way to steal a girls heart, offer her some Iberico pork and get her drunk on Cava. We are now married, so what else can I say than that it worked.Jos\u00e9 is the small and simple cava and tapas bar from Jos\u00e9 Pizaro who also runs a more upscale (still rather casual) restaurant called Pizarro down the road on Bermondsey Street. He was also before opening these places head chef at Tapas Brindisa. It is almost always crowded but people do not tend sit for long so often the wait is not that bad. Even if you cannot get a table immediately you can stand around and drink a glass of sparkling. The wait goes much faster with a drink in your handThere are usually three or four good sparklings (Cavas) by the glass. The wines are decently priced but perhaps not cheap, around \u00a35-7 per glass and \u00a330-40 per bottle (the on-going gentrification of Bermondsey Street has meant that prices are moving up). There are also nine different whites, three rosados and twelve reds by the glass. Food is excellent! The menu is not fixed, it is written on two black boards behind the bar and as things run out they are crossed off. However a few things can almost always be found there: some excellent Spanish cheeses as well as Jamon Iberico and chorizo. The Patatas Bravas, Pan con Tomate and Padron peppers are also some of my usual choices. My favorite is however, without a doubt, the flavorful Pluma Iberico (or when that is not on the menu the Secreto Iberico). Mmm, I would almost kill for that dish. All in all, I dont think I have ever been disappointed with a ny dish at Jos\u00e8's.Service is always friendly and considering that it is always packed things move along smoothly. I also do like the fact that they do not automatically include service on the bill - i am not a bad tipper, but I want to make the choice myself. A tip should be an incentive to provide extra good service, not a part of the normal salary. That's just my opinion and I wish more places would do that.After years of testing the quality of food at both Jos\u00e9 and Pizarro I can conclude that the food is excellent. I think it's partly due to good quality produce, but also the skill of the chefs. It requires a special talent making simple dishes well. An important element for me is also the no-fuss quality wine list. They rotate the wines now and then so often I find new things to try.",

Every time I go I can't get enough of it!!Their prawns are so fresh and you can taste and imagine the salty ocean as you take each bite. The ham on display is smoky and full of flavour. And their tortilla is a classic. Those are the classic tapas I order each time. Anything you order will be awesome there. My favourite spot is to be by the bar to see all the actions. And my final advice is to arrive early to get one of the few spots!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been on a bit of a mission over the summer to try out as many of the tapas restaurants in London as we could find. There are some real gems out there at the moment, but Jose is by far my favourite and earned itself a return visit on my latest trip up to the big smoke.Knowing that it doesn't take reservations, we got there well before 12 the first time, and sure enough we were seated in the table in the middle. Its a fairly tiny restaurant but they will do their best to squeeze you in, even if it looks like an impossible task on first appearances. The second occasion we got there at 2.30pm on a Saturday, but they still managed to prop us up in a little corner and later moved us to a couple of stools by the window once space became available.The menu changes on a daily basis, depending on what is available, and the dishes are listed on the blackboards behind the bar. The food is prepared and cooked in an open kitchen, a delight to a nosey foodie such as myself! The wine list is exceptional, even the house wine tasting delicious, it's far too easy to wile away a long afternoon in this cosy, vibrant restaurant.Some of the highlights from the menu are the tomato bread, pimentos de Padron, chorizo, Iberico pork cheek, hake, and mixed cheeses. Not to mention the croquetas - we have tried both the ham and the cod and both are absolutely delicious - creamy, crunchy and full of flavour! I have even purchased the cookbook so I can try and master these little delights myself!The staff are all really friendly, and it's a great opportunity to practise my Spanish.This is definitely a rustic, tradition tapas experience. If you want something a little more formal, head down the road to Jose's second restuarant Pizzaro. But if you are looking for something reminiscent of Spain, head to Jose, squeeze in to a small corner and indulge yourself for an afternoon!",

    "text": "I lived in the area for a while and Jose was popping every time I walked past it so I knew I had to check it out!The restaurant is small and cozy, and I love that it's tucked away on a quieter corner of Bermonsey Street. I came with a friend on a Saturday late morning for brunch to avoid the wait. They serve wine all day but unfortunately it was too early for us. The food menu is displayed on two blackboards behind the open kitchen. The tapas menu is equally balanced with meat and vegetarian options and some of the names may sound very foreign but the staff are helpful and accommodating.What you need to try is the Jamon Iberico and Bermondsey Bomba! The Jamon Iberico is a great appetizer. It's super flavorful and the texture is perfect - it almost melts in your mouth. The Bermondsey Bomba is an incredibly delicious and comforting beef and potato croquette topped with housemade tomato sauce and aioli. Like its name, it's an explosion of flavors. The other things we got were impressive too! The fried goats cheese with honey is a must if your a fan of goat cheese. You also can't go wrong with the pan con tomate (toasted bread with crushed tomatoes and olive oil) - I suggest starting your meal with this. Lastly, we tried the huevos rotos - this is a fried egg served on a bed of shoe string fries. Break the egg when it comes to your table. The crispy fries are delicious dipped in the runny egg yolk. Overall, a cozy and authentic place for Spanish tapas and wine. I'm definitely coming back to try the wine next time!",

Warning, they don't have AC and it's an open kitchen so I sweat more inside than I did walking around all day outside. Worth it though, the food was great.

And it really felt like he was, even in the middle of a packed restaurant and here we are trying to add to his workload. He offered to let us stand at the counter and start ordering food and then once a seat opened, they'd move us over. We ordered the tortilla, the croquettas, and the potatas bravas. Let me say, it was one of the cheapest meals we had in London and was also one of the best meals we had. The service was friendly and fast. They couldn't have been nicer to us. We had meant to visit last year but they don't take reservations so we never wanted to wait for a table so luckily for us, we did make it this time and had a great night. This place is very close to the underground and a bunch of pubs in case there is a wait. We even got some tortilla to go after we ate the first plate they brought out. Eat here.",

    "text": "I've been walking past here for a year now assuming that this was the waiting area and that there is an underground part to it. I was wrong. It is a tee is tiny space, almost bar like, with lots of places to perch, definitely not suitable for large groups. And that is why this place is cool. I think where people go wrong with tapas is when there are too many people and someone (possibly an ordering novice) takes over ordering and under orders. With a small place like this, where quite literally a party of three is verging on the 'too big' side, it's hard to under order as you will probably want one of everything and it's easier not to be polite in a two or a three. Rule of thumb: start with the tomato bread, knockout some of those initial worms, then work your way through as much as possible. Menu changes regularly but there will be jamon, croquettes, tortilla, the potato bravas with aioli, something with chorizo, maybe even a bocadillo (conveniently named slider for your English benefit). Wine list is awesome: start with a sherry. Staff are just as awesome- truly hospitality professionals with personality, enjoying what they do. See you in the window!",

    "text": "What I love about tapas is that it comes thick and fast. It matches the buzz of a Spanish environment and its atmosphere, and this is what makes @jose_pizarro one of if not THE best Spanish bars to eat in London. Tight, cosy & authentic space. Certainly my favourite tho Barrafina is battling it close as if it was Ronaldo vs Messi for the Ballon d'or (again).I did want the pluma, oh THAT pluma; looking out for it as I peaked over her diners toward the specials board, but found the ib\u00e9rico pork fillet as a great substitute. Melt in the mouth goodness. Could easily eat two plates of these.Was gasping for some King Prawns a la plancha like I had last time, but wasn't on there so ended up for going for a fish. Served medium rare which I have never seen before. Was asked if I wanted it cooked more and I did. Better cooked through IMO.I also shared some Spanish croquettes. Today is the turn of spinach to be the hero, which is unbelievably moist with that cheese inside.(Updated review - 19th Nov '15)",

    "text": "Jose tapas had very tasty food, very tasty food indeed, but to me it was a place that tried a little too hard to create a spanish atmosphere in London. First the good:Great red wine- the second and third choices on the menu were both good recomendations from the waitress, with the second choice, the Granache, our favorite (\u00a34.5-\u00a35 per glass). \u00a0Usually my wife and I dont esepcailly enjoy spanish wine. \u00a0Croquetas- crispy on the outside while perfectly fluffy on the inside. \u00a0Definitely melt-in-your-mouth (\u00a36.5)Tortilla- with courgettes and some type of drizzle. \u00a0Hardy (\u00a34.5)Pan con Tomate- hard to dissapoint (\u00a33.5)The only thing that put us off was the lack of seating- there was ample standing room, but the place seemed to only distribute seats to about half the places. \u00a0We asked to wait until we could get seats to eat, but they seemed to want to rush us out by 'recomending' multiple times to order as soon as possible. \u00a0We did not want to pay 4x the price of similar food in Spain and be rushed out. \u00a0Seems the exact antithesis of the spanish way. \u00a0The waitresses were nice after this initial unpleasantness, and especially once we got seats. \u00a0Overall, a fun place, but will probably not return.",

    "text": "Jos\u00e9 is the small and simple cava and tapas bar from Jos\u00e9 Pizzaro who also runs a more upscale (still rather casual though) down the road on Bermondsey Street. Jos\u00e9 is in a way too close to where I live as it is always tempting to stop by for a glass (or bottle) of cava and some of the lovely tapas. It is almost always crowded here but people do not tend sit for long so often the wait is not that bad and with a glass of sparkling in the hand time moves faster.There are usually three or four sparkling by the glass and a few reds and whites as well. The wines are decently priced but perhaps not cheap, the on-going gentrification of Bermondsey Street has meant that prices are moving up. Food is excellent, the menu is not fixed (written on two black boards behind the bar and as things run out they are crossed off the board) but a few things can almost always be found there so there will be some excellent Spanish cheeses as well as Jamon and chorizo. My favorite is however without a doubt the flavorful Pluma Iberico (or when that is not on the menu the Secreto Iberico). Service is always friendly and considering that it is always packed things move along smoothly. I also do like the fact that they do not automatically include service on the bill - more places should do that.So to summarize my favorite tapas place in London (and where I can likely be found on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday and any other day I may happen to me home).",

It was amazing! \u00a0The only negative was I felt like they had really small pours of wine, more than other spots in London. \u00a0That was disappointing, but not enough to not return. \u00a0I will be recommending this Tapas bar everyone that is spending time in London.

    "text": "First off, I'm not generally a tapas guy--nothing against the taste but just not normally into small portions or sharing food =) ...but fast forward to this dining trip, and I may have to change my mind about tapas. This place was simply amazing! We ate in a couple of rounds, ordering first the Jam\u00f3n (OMG), Patatas Bravas (yum!), and Bread w/ Tomato (simple but succulent)--all of these blew my mind. Our 2nd round consisted of the fried calamari, chorizo sausages, and fried (really saut\u00e9ed) peppers--again, all delicious. To accompany our meal, we ordered a bottle of ros\u00e9, which paired perfectly with all of our selections.I didn't know it when we came here, but the restaurant is owned by celebrated Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro. I'll definitely be buying his book on Spanish cooking! ...and waiting for the day he brings his stuff to NYC!",
