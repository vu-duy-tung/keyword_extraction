I had been back many times in my travels to the U.K. and it was always my favorite restaurant in London. It been several years since I had been back and I wanted to take my husband to share a memory. I must say I was sadly disappointed. The service was subpar at best.I wasn't given a wine list until I asked what type of white wine they have. \u00a0No one ever bothered to tell us the specials,which I wouldn't have known they had except that I heard every other table be told them. The waitress who came to open our wine left to answer severely calls eventually asking another server to give us our wine because she had other things to attend to. It was obvious their regular customers were far more important, especially the owner who only paid attention to regulars and didn't even great us. The food itself as a whole was edible at best. You could cut glass with the bread it was so hard. Some times memories are best left in the past. I most certainly will never return to that dreadful place ever again. It is more than evident the new generation of owners has a different management style.Zev M. KramerPhiladelphia PA USA",

When the spaghetti and clams arrived, although a staple and most pedestrian of Italian cusines, it immediately bought me a feeling of familiarity and content. \u00a0The group devoured this as our chosen pasta plates arrived. \u00a0My veal ravioli were delicious, delectable, and cooked to perfection. \u00a0And then for the main course, the veal saltimbocca was amazing. \u00a0For a city known to be expensive, Il Portico was definitely a value. \u00a0I'm not saying it's cheap, but for the value of the cosine, I'd definitely open my wallet again. \u00a0As I'm in this area fairly often, I'll be sure to make a return to Il Portico shortly.",

It's warm, inviting, and all of the staff are superbly polite and trained to perfection.Following the HUGE tasty olives and fresh-baked ciabatta we were given upon arrival, I had a king prawn starter for the second time. I can't recommend it enough. With garlic, herbs, lemon and a hint of chili, the sauce will have you asking for more bread and the seafood itself is top notch. Great portion size and something I'll have again in a heartbeat.Then I had the handmade pumpkin and ricotta tortellini, which were JUST as I hoped. Light, creamy and utterly divine.My other half had a lovely starter of what looked like a slice of a giant cannelloni, with meat ragu and bechamel sauce filling. It had all the flavours of lasagna, just in a different format. Taaaaaasty. Then he has steak with wild mushroom sauce (which the owner later told us were handpicked), which was also very, very good.We has beautiful wine to match and left happy, with the bill coming in at a very reasonable \u00a382. I would have had a dessert but just wasn't that inspired by what was on offer, next time I hope there will be something to whet my appetite.",

While I realize the UK doesn't have the same Italian immigration history as the US, I am still a little disappointed in the lack of basic Italian cuisine in London. And what I'm searching for is probably more of a hybrid Italian-American cuisine than anything--but that's beside the point, because I'm an American, and I want things how I want them (this is me trying to be a self-deprecating Yank). \u00a0Well, this past weekend I was introduced to a little Sicilian place in Kensington, that is very close to the mob-fronted, Italian-American places I know and love in Chicago. While it was a little warm inside, we stayed cool with a crisp bottle of trebbiano, grilled sardines, and beautiful prosciutto and mozzarella di bufala. For mains it was pasta, although I have it on good authority that the osso bucco is also quite good. The gnocchi was nicely chewy and drowning in heart-stopping amounts of cheese, while the linguine in squid ink was just as amazing. Lots of beautifully saut\u00e9ed little fishes accompanied it. It was heavenly, and I can't wait to go back. Although next time I'll make a reservation ahead of time. We did have a little trouble getting in just after prime-dinner hour, but it gave us an excuse to check out the quirks of the neighbourhood. All in all, a very successful night!",

    "text": "Odd experience last night at Il Portico. Greeted by the staff when we arrived. Seated immediately. A couple of minutes later the woman at the front informed us that we would need to give up our table at 8pm. Since it was only 6:15p we were not bothered by this request but found it odd to be told that after being seated. Our waiter was attentive and friendly and the food was delicious! But our attention was often turned to the woman at the front who was visibly stressed about the pending reservation at 8pm. Not sure who she was expecting but every patron who entered after us was told the same thing about giving up their table. I'm sure this was just a fluke occurance so we would still return for another delicious meal.",

We arrived 30 minutes too early for our reservation. The main man ( I dont know if he is the owner) took my plus one and me to there other Restaurant 50 meters down the street to get a drink while we wait for our seats to be free.The barkeeper at this place than gave the Il Portico a call after 30 minutes to confirm our table is free now and we went back then. This is such a good service!Not to mention the huge efforts to make us feel very welcomeFood:The quality of the food, also in comparison to its price, is unbelievable.As starters we had the plate of different kinds of meat and a plate with different kinds of cheese. Our mains were a Risotto which was stunning and probably the best Pasta Bolognese I ever had!Place:The place is small and cozy. As someone mentioned before its like arriving at your own home place and having a dinner. If you fancy italian food you must have been at this place!",

I think I'd have been pretty shocked if the food was like, something weird, like Brazilian, but then I went through my mental database of Italian diaspora statistics and sure enough, like every one in Brazil is Italian so not that crazy.Very nice people run it, and the food is excellent, fresh and simple. Really a great neighbourhood spot.",

For main course I had the lamb steak which was on special. Both dishes seemed quite good but a friend of ours had the risotto which was just a touch underdone. I also had the affogato for desert and shared a bottle of wine between the four of us. Came out to about 40 pounds per person. Not bad for a night out including 3 course meal and wine!",

The place was packed when we arrived, so we were glad we made a reservation. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we made a reservation to come back the next night,Atmosphere- This is a cute neighborhood restaurant, nicely decorated with white tablecloths & outdoor seating.Staff- Very friendly! They all worked together as a team each one checking on us at different points in time refilling wine, water and such.Food- Delicious and home made with strong delicious flavors. \u00a0We started with the Sardines and they were perfectly cooked, salty and crisp at the same time. I had Pasta both nights, and each time the sauce was flavored well and perfectly cooked. My husband had the free range chicken, it was so good he ordered it two nights in a row. It was crisped on the outside and perfectly juicy on the inside.The only downside was when people started to smoke in the outside seating & the window is open smoke would blow in a little bit (we were seated near the window both nights). We closed the window and it was better.",

For dessert we had the tiramisu and that was the perfect dessert to end the meal. They had great cocktails and the service was impeccable. I wanted to go back for lunch the next day but didn't have enough time. If you are in this area, you need to dine here. Hats off to the owners, servers and chefs.",

    "text": "I generally refuse to eat Italian food (except pizza) because I am a traditionalist and always disappointed by restaurants claiming to be authentic. Il Portico, however, is an absolute exception. The staff are fantastic - everyone is smiling, everyone is personable, everyone wants to crack a joke, everyone is enjoying themselves that it just rubs off on you - and yet they do this all without compromising on efficient and attentive service.The Asparagi alla Parmigiana -Grilled asparagus with Parmigiano Reggiano gratin - were nice and crunchy with a thin layer of melted cheese on top. Simple yet tasty. The Prosciutto and Mozzarella plate was simple, but you could tell the prosciutto had been freshly sliced just then as it was light pink in colour with no dried edges. The Fusilli Ortolana - Fusilli with sundried tomatos,artichokes, and spring vegetable - was fresh, cooked perfectly al dente with just the right amount of vegetables and not overdone with sauce. The Gnocchi alla Sorrentina - homemade (yes! finally real ones!) gnocchi with tomato sugo, melted mozzarella and basil, baked in the oven - were divine. PERFECT gnocchi - not gummy, not too soft, not a factory-made shape. Beautiful in a simple tomato sauce laced with mozzarella cheese that didn't come out in globs.I will most definitely be returning.",
