The place itself is also nothing special but at least it feels authentic and isn't one of this tourist places you will find so often in central London. So at least there is one good thing to it.We went there for a Sunday roast and we all agreed that the food wasn't executed very well. My beef was dry and overcooked. The veggies were regular frozen vegetables that \u00a0just got re-heated and the Yorkshire pudding was pale. The ales are good, but you can't really mess that up, can you...It might be that the place is good for drinking in the evening, but I certainly cannot recommend this for eating, especially not for a Sunday roast. At least it is cheap, so if you are only looking for some food to fill you up after a night out this could be your place, if you are looking for high quality pub food look somewhere else.",

Set in an Art Deco building, there's a rather familial feel to this Kings Cross pub, especially in the winter when the two fires are roaring away. But what really is starting to draws the Sunday crowds is The Pines music slot here every other Sunday, which kicks off at the convenient hour of 2pm, just enough time for you to settle in to your Erdinger Weissbeir and Rumpsteak. Admission is \u00a33 and the quality of the bands is ever-increasing. Check their myspace page for listings MySpace.com/HarrisonBarThe food menu is cheap and represent a variety of continents, they have a good selection of beers on tap, and if you feel like your weary legs can't make it those few steps to the station, stay in one of the rooms for \u00a395.",

The place was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday night, with what looked like a crowd accustomed to hanging out there. Service was alright, there were times when we had to go to the bar to get the attention of the waitress but once you dig in to the delish food, you forgive them for making you work for your food.I ordered the steak and I'm no steak connoisseur - I find it hard to tell the difference between the various degrees between good and awesome steaks, but I can recognize brilliance when I eat it. The steak at abt 13quid was well worth the money and the green-peppercorn was a nice accompaniment. My medium steak was perfectly made, it was juicy and tender but showed no unsightly streams of red halfway through the meal. I had a bite out of their burger too and the tender crumbliness of the finely-ground meat was an absolute delight. I'm already planning on another night out at this next door pub which is also well stocked in a wide range of beers, wines and spirits.I'm averse to giving it a 5-star because of the lackadaisical service but food's right up there as a 5-star.",

    "text": "The Harrison - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) In my search for the best burger in London, I have been fortunate to have had some pretty good experiences like the ones at Byron, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and more recently at The Harrison with Mr Noodles and Dr G. This arduous task is proving a most enjoyable quest despite disastrous meals at The Diner in Islington and Grand Union. I was also a little disappointed with Hache in Camden Town although I feel I should pay it at least another visit before making my mind up. Another unfortunate experience was at The Fine Burger Co. on Upper Street which I am still to write about. This month I will be trying the two most talked about burgers in town, Hawksmoor and Goodman's. Considered the top end of steak houses, their burgers & chips do not come cheap at \u00a315 and \u00a312 respectively. The Harrison was an interesting find, and one I would not have come across but for Mr Noodles' invitation. I would not describe it as a gastro-pub and despite its subtle gentrification, it retained some of its original elegant features. The menu was reassuringly simple and excellent value with meals ranging from \u00a38 for a wild mushroom, spinach and ricotta lasagne to \u00a313.50 for a rib-eye steak, salad and chips. The beers on offer included quality brands such as Guinness, Staropramen, Erdinger (weissbeer) and some Belgium bottled beers. Mr Noodles and I were both happy with our combination of burgers, coleslaw, salad and chips @ \u00a39 \u00a0the patties were meaty and juicy and perfectly cooked. Dr G was however not as lucky \u00a0his burger was overcooked, while his French fries needed a bit more cooking, and his salad was poorly washed and gritty. I would like to return to The Harrison although the lack of consistency in their cooking is an issue that needs to be addressed. Cost: \u00a39 for burger, chips, and salad + \u00a33 to \u00a34 for a pint of beer. Likes: good patties, simple and good value menu, and Erdinger weissbeer on tap. Dislikes: lack of consistency in their cooking, gritty salad. Verdict: good value local pub serving some quality beers and food in Kings Cross. Well worth a detour if in the area, but make sure the burger is cooked medium and the French fries are crisp.",

It should be noted that this wasn't my first choice for a pub burger but the place I had in mind, the Gunmakers has a rotating menu and the burger isn't always available. Now the burger at The Harrison was by and large a fine specimen although not without flaws. That said many of the flaws are due to foodie-fussiness. Personally, I was a little disappointed with the bun, which didn't hold the burger in properly and there were also issues with consistency. Two out of the three burgers were fine but one was overcooked. That said I think the burger here is a cut above the gourmet chains with the patty having a definite own-made feel about it. Other than the one duff specimen, the burgers were thick and juicy and a steal at \u00a39, including a side salad, coleslaw, and fries or chips. The only downside is location as although The Harrison is a decent pub, unless you live or work nearby, I'm not sure it's worth coming to this part of a town for a burger and a Guinness.",

For a start, you can easily get lunch for a fiver, which I've come to think is impossible in London town, and secondly the service was really quick and accommodating since we turned up in two big groups at different times. My instant regret was not trying the burgers. When everyone around you gets a huge hunk of delicious patty and you've gone the 'sensible' route with a halloumi wrap, I challenge you not to be jealous. (Unless you're veggie, naturally.) By all accounts, those burgers looked phat and juicy. However, the halloumi wrap, friends, is definitely worth a look. None of that scrimping on cheese, the slices were huge. And the sauce, yoghurt (or creme fraiche?) and some kind of Mexican flavoured stuff, was pretty delicious. It came with salad and crisps, which were more than I could finish.Love the vibe\u00a0-- trad pub feel, tables outside for a warmer day, and great friendly staff. Put it on your list if you're in the area.",

The food is pleasing and the service good though tonight it was incredibly noisy due to a coincidence of some overly loud customers at nearby tables. A little hard to hear our conversations as a result. Not the pub's fault and don't be deterred - hopefully it will be a little quieter next time. Easy walk from Kings Cross but a little out of the way. Work out your route before you go.",

    "text": "Packed on a Thursday night, the Harrison does not have the rambunctious and frantic air of other pubs in Bloomsbury, but a more mature, congenial presence. Tucked away amongst council houses, they offer an impressive selection of bottled beers in addition to the standard draughts. As far as red wine goes, they had an option of Malbec or Merlot, two of my favorites. I went with the Malbec, which was quite nice. As I was only in here waiting for an appointment, I did not have time to sample the food, but I was impressed with their multiple vegetarian options and wish that I had stayed to eat. Next time!",

From the outside it looks like it could be a working men's club. We were utterly amazed and delighted by the menu and the quality of the food. The presentation was thoughtful and service was fast, although the place wasn't busy when we were there. There was an excellent guest ale on tap to round it off. Not sure what this place would be like as an evening joint. They seem to have a pretty good live music scene advertised. As a lunch place it's a winner.",

Getting a table was easy and there were not too many guests. Probably this place is rather crowded in the night time.Staff was extremely friendly - a young lady was serving us. I had a salmon wrap with chips and grilled vegetables. It was quite tasty and enough. Price was good. The food of my fellow colleagues looked good as well, especially the burger.I would probaby go there again if I find it again:-)Kann ich empfehlen:-)",

All of the dishes seemed very enticing and I got the sense that the chef took his time putting together each dish with an interesting variety of ingredients.I go ahead and call and the host was extremely confused that I was calling to pick up, he told me they did not do delivery, and after explaining that I wanted to pick up my meal to-go he finally understood. He had to ask the chef if this was possible, and indeed it was. It was ready in a quick 10 minutes.I arrive at the location, and it was totally packed. My doggy bag was ready to go and the staff was friendly enough. I ordered the vegetarian burger and the dressed salad, I could sense on the phone that he hadn't gotten the dressed salad. Lo and behold the salad wasn't there but it was partially my fault for not reiterating.Overall the meal was quite delicious and I would recommend the vegetarian burger, but I probably won't make it back to this place again.",
