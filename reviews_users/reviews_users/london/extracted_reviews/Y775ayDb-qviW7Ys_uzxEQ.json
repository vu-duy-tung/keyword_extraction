    "text": "it would get 5* if not for the excruciating wait.P&B is tucked toward the end of James street (almost on wigmore st) between the shisha place and the tanning shop. \u00a0a bench outside where hipsters sit and wait - please note... it is not permitted to queue outside the tan-shop so the queue loops around in a circle.Had the smokey robinson and ari gold. \u00a0agree with other reviews so won't repeat. \u00a0There is no dessert menuprepare for a wait over 1 hour outside to get in and actually wrap up eating within 20 mins... idk if this means that it IS worth the wait.. all I can say is... please don't go when hungry b/c you'll end up almost resenting service for being so quick with your order and that you have to leave asap. (ie within 20 mins of going in the door)the thunderthighs in jalepeno sauce were \"fall-off-the-bone\" tender... but the skin wasn't crisp... so had to move to the side....overall really good. what I saw around me was ppl getting them in the tamarind sauce (version).the fries/chips with the chicken skin bits mayo were okay... but I couldn't really taste any outstanding flavour in the mayo... so not sure if worth the extra 75p for the mayo. \u00a0on the table there is mayo and ketchup and they bring hot sauce and mustard if you want. \u00a0plenty for your chips. \u00a0FOOD: overall REALLY tasty grub, definitely on the greasy side, the burger meat cooked to your liking, chips are good, thighs good.. all seemed done right.AMBIENCE: very loud music which is fine b/c you're practically sitting next to strangers... so a bit of buffer is not discouraged. \u00a0quick service and quite attentive. Servers are quite easy going and may bust a move to the rhythm of the background music. \u00a0 These was OUR order1 smoky robinson1 ari gold1 side of chips with mayo1 side of jalapeno soaked thunderthighs1 diet coke1 lemonade For \u00a332 (including tip)hope this helps :)",

Instead of traditional buns they use brioches which just positively melt in your mouth. The meat was cooked to perfection and the condiments complemented the meal perfectly.Went here last night in a group of 5. We had to wait 25 minutes which for a Saturday peak time isn't too bad, especially considering it's only a 30 seater.The staff are really friendly and the ambiance is very bohemian and young.Burgers are \u00a37.50-\u00a38.50 and a portion of chips is \u00a32.50.A can of soft drink is \u00a31.50, which for that price really should be a bottle.",

So went in on my own (I know lame Billy no mates). I had the smokey Robinson and a beer. Oh my god! It was amazing I smashed it down in about 3 minutes then felt bad for not savouring it. From what I remember in the short period it graced my tongue it was the best burger I have ever eaten and I'm not joking. The bread was beautiful and sweet, the burger juicy and so much flavour! The bacon lovely and the salt contrasting with the sweet bun mmmmm. Might have to go get another now I've written this.",

I ordered their mushroom veggie burger which was amazing, not too heavy. Their buns are fresh and so tasty, it makes a huge difference! Their fries topped with rosemary are also mouth watering. It's important to note that the burgers weren't that greasy and I didn't feel like a piece of lard after stuffing my face (which is mostly how I feel after most burger joints). Ambience is causal, and they place great Indie-pop tunes, just at the right level so that it doesn't take over conversations. Must go, and don't wear anything light colored. Guaranteed mess while eating! Enjoy!",

    "text": "We went here about a year ago, just before it was listed in Time Out magazine and have never been able to get a seat since. (I'm not a fan of queuing...) But last Monday at around 8ish we decided to give it another go, with great success. Managed to get \u00a0a seat straight away, ordered, ate and left all within about 20 mins! The burgers are amazing. They are, without doubt, one of the best burgers I've eaten and any other burger pales in comparison. We had the Ari Gold, which is your basic cheese burger, but the sauces and the picked onions and everything that comes on top with a brioche bun makes it juicy perfection. The burgers are cooked medium as standard, so there's a lot of pink, but I think it adds to it. I like to put the chips on the paper underneath the burger, so that they can soak up all the juices that drip down.My only complaint this time was the music, seriously.. it was 8pm on a Monday night and I couldn't hear my husband talk it was so ridiculously loud. P&B aren't the only ones guilty of this crime, it seems to be par for the course at the moment, but it's a really off putting feature. I appreciate the need for a 'vibe' but, just turn it down.. I actually spent the time waiting for my food with my fingers in my ears.Would definitely have received 5* had it not been for that.",

A couple of minutes after taking my seat \u00a0a mountain of pickled red onions, a medium-rare beef patty with chorizo relish, smoked cheese, lettuce and tomato landed on my table. On the side, home-made crunchy chips coated with aromatic rosemary salt. Pricewise, the meal costed approximately \u00a310 (drinks excluded). The burgers and the sides are separated, allowing creative combinations. Add a Red Stripe for \u00a34. The BBC counting our bites added to the experience! UP:- Forks and knives are officially not needed. It's a burger joint after-all! - An additional portion of chips that was accidentally added in our order arrived free of charge. - At around 4.30pm, no queue for us! - Male model sightings! :p DOWN:- All dinners should be present before sitting on the table. In other words, you cannot occupy a table of five if only three of you are on location waiting for the other two to arrive shortly. Bummer. \u00a0- The optional service was already included in the bill, meaning that the actual food cost was not easy to calculate and decide about the amount of the tips. - Male models eating burgers. In your face. :p VERDICT:Like and Follow!",

Heck I would even pay close to a tenner to get that perfect burger (for the US readers that is almost 15 dollars which we Brits find reasonable for London and you may not). Patty and Bun hit quite the right spot- a small selection of excellent burgers. They manage to cook them to perfection- medium rare- a feat I imagine quite tricky considering how busy this place gets. The only side that is really worth mentioning are the fries, which I highly recommend. It is small- emphasis on the small, and can get quite cramped, so avoid if you get offended by sharing a table or hitting your head on the rather low hanging lamp shades. Also by all means do not try and come here at lunch times or high peak times unless you love to que. I was fortunate enough to not have to do so and was quickly served by the friendly and hip staff. The \"Lambshank Redemption\" and \"Smoking Robinson\" burgers were a personal favourite!",

I have actually walked past this place numerous times and never gave it much thought as I felt that it was just another burger joint. When I saw all the raving reviews and it was around the corner from where I was working I thought why not as I needed something quick and most places in the area are sit down slow service places. I was very torn which burger to order as they all sounded amazing but after reading reviews a settled on the Ari gold. Ari gold had great flavours and I would fully recommend it but next time I'm going to branch out and try the Jose Jose or the smokey Robinson. The fries/chips where nice as they had rosemary baked into them. I am still a GBK and meat liqueur fan but this place gives a bit of a competition. Worth a try !",

I had the ARI Gold cheeseburger with fries and slaw (mental note never by slaw again, ever!) and chicken wings as an after thought. The burger was spot on, brioche bun, gooey cheese mixed with beef juices from a medium patty mmmm patty come to daddy. Great tasting burger and good fries. The wings were lame as they are coated with something and I just didn't rate them. Menu is small as with all these places but it could have done with onion rings. I would return for the burger but the queue frightens the life out of me. If I were in the immediate area I'd definitely eat there again but so far haven't managed to return.

The fries are a little too salty and the portions are on the smaller side given the price. We arrived at 12 exactly and had no problem getting a table for six, but beware that if you arrive even at 12:15 there will be a queue. They also make you collect your entire party before sitting down, otherwise, when you get to the front of the line they won't seat you.I think we would have had a better experience if we ordered takeaway and went to the park to enjoy our meal without the ambient stress of knowing that others are waiting for your table. Patty & Bun is fine, the burgers are solid, but I think it's maybe not worth the hype.",

Wooden tables and some really cool cardboard box artwork on the walls (e.g. there was a box with a sword painted on it and it said \"caution: made in china\" on the side).Unfortunately with the size comes the wait. We got there at 1210 for lunch on a Thursday and were seated around 1245 (for a group of 4). 2 groups of 2s who came behind us were seated first though so it's probably best to go with just one other person. That being said, there's something about the whole patty & bun experience that's best shared so maybe just go in a group but be sure you go off peak.Food:I had the 'Ari Gold' (essentially a cheeseburger). I can only imagine that eating this was as satisfying as getting a hug from the man himself would be because it's definitely one of the best burgers I've had anywhere. The burger features an incredible patty. Cooked to perfection (medium-rare), insanely juicy and a perfect size. 4 stars because I would have liked the patty itself to be a tiny bit more flavourful, so a tad more seasoning would have been welcome.Patty aside it's complimented with cheese, mayo, pickled red onions, tomato and lettuce (you can add bacon though I didn't). The buns here deserve special mention because they really stand out. All these ingredients are sandwiched between the most amazing looking golden toasted brioche. The bread itself is light but retains its shape perfectly and doesn't crumble, even with the juiciness of the burger and the amount of sauce inside.We each also got an order of the rosemary salt fries. These were spot on, and definitely worth ordering.Overall:My mouth is watering as I'm writing this...",

Two of us got the Smokey Robinson burger, and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The BBQ mayo sauce was delicious and the beef was cooked perfectly. My other friend got the chicken burger and she loved it as well. We also split chips and wings. The chips were good but nothing too special. The wings were excellent and included lots of meat.The waitresses and host were all very nice and friendly. For how busy this place is, service is very efficient. The music is loud, but I don't mind it. Some older customers might not enjoy this as much.Overall, I will definitely be back. Next time I want to try the Ari Gold burger.",

The crunchy chicken burger is also a winner - pro tip, get one of each and ask the waitress to half them for sharing. Unless you go by yourself, then relax because noone will see you eating two burgers. The fries are good, but not necessary. The wings were over sweet for my taste and I once had a stewed meat fries ball thing here that was awful. I admire their continued creativity though. The worst aspect is the queue that usually forms outside. 15 minutes wait was not too bad though. The beers are ok, but I'd like to see the menu lengthened as the longhorn IPA is just ok. For a standard burger, my pick goes to Burger & Lobster btw. So stick to the more complex concoctions.",

    "text": "There's a patty in my buns and everyone's invited.In 80 years time, society will probably be horrified by the gastronomic decadence of our time, shocked at the calorific value of our foods, our bingeing, our excesses, illustrated most poignantly by the burger boom of the early 2010s. \u00a0Pictures of vile people, stuffing oversized, greasy, dripping, wasteful burgers into their faces (juxtaposed with photos of starving children, no doubt) will adorn the history textbooks, along with snarky captions about how attitudes have since changed. \u00a0I can imagine that Patty& Bun will be one of the poster children for this nutritional austerity movements...it has everything: meat, grease, and droves of queuing customers.Honestly, I never intended to wait an hour for burgers. \u00a0I'm pretty against waiting for restaurants, but a certain Yelp member insisted so I relented. \u00a0After all, I had been meaning to go to P&B for a while (their street stall being excellent), so I figured it would be ok. \u00a0Well, it would've been if it hadn't been a Friday night. \u00a0ANYWAY.An hour and a bit later we were in! \u00a0Yes, P&B don't take names and call. \u00a0You have to wait out there like sad sacks whilst you wistfully look at the people finishing up AND TAKING AGES TO PAY THEIR SODDING BILL AND GET UP AND LEAVE. \u00a0Luckily, summer makes this ok. \u00a0P&B is smallish with a cosy interior - they've really nailed the shack chic (it's certainly more of a shack than that other burger place in Covent Garden), right down to the dearth of crockery.I've meant to try the other burgers but I've only ever had the Smokey Robinson because onions. \u00a0I can't resist caramelised onions. \u00a0I also don't really get the naming references, but either way it's all moot. \u00a0This is the archetypal slopfest that will shock future generations. It's a pornographically messy burger which oozes and drips and melts everywhere with that awesome medium rare patty (cue salivation) with a nice aged tinge to it along with the smokiness and the onions and the sauce all over the face. \u00a0I mean, it's just one of those things you have to experience. \u00a0I don't have definitive burger rankings, but this is possibly the top. They're so good that I don't remember how good the chips are - I know they're decent, but they're probably ranked a little below Honest. \u00a0Not sure. \u00a0Oh, and we decided to get the confit chicken wings because, y'know, a gigantic hunk of beef isn't enough. \u00a0The sauce is great, but whilst the meat falls off the bone I kind of felt that the texture's somewhat...amorphous. \u00a0I dunno. \u00a0It was a little too soft for my liking. \u00a0Didn't stop me from eating a bunch, obviously.On balance, I love the P&B experience. \u00a0I just can't justify giving 5*s to somewhere which requires an hour of queuing. \u00a0Hey, I'm all for delayed gratification but really, no-one needs to see me when I'm hungry. \u00a0With that said, I am yet to leave P&B without feeling a little bit disgusted with myself (more things that future generations won't understand). \u00a0Disgusted with what I have become and how I, single handedly, am creating food shortages around the world. \u00a0But I will go back again. \u00a0And again. \u00a0Because I'm a disgusting backwards savage from the 2010s.",

The hype, the expectations, were not met.Why?The burger patty was cooked perfectly, juicy, but tasteless, not even the charred flavour Meatmarket has. There wasn't enough cheese. The bun was brioche solid and held the fillings competently but was hideously sweet and ruined the burger with every sweet bready whiff.The chips, however, were awesome, crispy and soft in the right places, decent flavour, overly salty but the way chips should be.Service was good, efficiently organising the queues. Drinks choices were boring but the special burger sounded great.I mean this with love, if you are thinking of getting an amazing burger, go to Bleecker St in Spitalfield's, nothing compares to that and if you do, you will never need P&B.",

Luckily for us patty&bun was just around the corner.There was still a queue outside, but nowhere near as big. A friendly waiter came out to greet us and took down my name, he informed us we would have to wait 30-35 minutes. The wait was more like 20 minutes max - happy days.The restaurant can only fit about 30 people, so you do feel a bit packed in, but the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is nice and chilled.I ordered the 'Ari Gold' burger (with no tomato and no onions) and my girlfriend had the 'Smokey Robinson', we both had the chips with rosemary salt.We were impressed with how quickly the food arrived and liked the packaging.The burgers were quite greasy, but tasty none the less. The p&b mayo is delicious so make sure to take advantage of the bottle on your table.They cook the burgers medium rare, which I love but it was a little too rare for my girlfriend. So make sure to ask for well done if you don't like your meat pink.The fries were pretty damn good too!Overall it is better than the likes of ShakeShack but didn't blow my mind",

The fries are good. The chicken wings were incredibly rich - too rich for me. Would be awesome if the did a buffalo version of them though. We'll go back, once I recover from my bypass surgery.",

My only gripe is that they include an 'optional' service charge on your bill. How people are itching to be that asshole who says \"I'd really prefer to not pay this extra 75p.\" I came close, honestly, but didn't want to be that guy. The burgers are already expensive (\u00a37.50 for the most basic option), though. I don't know, optional - but included! - service charges just rub me the wrong way. Especially when the service is fairly nonchalant, which I'd say it was.",

    "text": "The burger is something we in the UK have tried to do for a while. A meat slab sandwiched between two buns purchased from Tesco, with a slice of lettuce, and an attempt to lather in cheese, have been evident for a while. Most commonly cited in the UK is the specialised \"pub\" burger, by the gastro centric local produce gatherer, and the pop up trendy huts that serve \"honest food n that\". Anyway, patty and bun came along, and confidently swiped aside pretence, and went for the classic hands down greasy tastefest that is the epitome of what \u00a0a really good burger should be like. One bite, and it's wolfed down. Its an addictive experience, governed by ones willingness to chase their own taste bud fulfillment levels. Go Try it see what you think. They are good, tasty, gritty, quality, and moreish. You know when food is really good, when you want another immediately after. And no.... They are not small... Go.",

Definitely tops alot of the other trendy burger places for sure! The burger was sooo juicy, flavorsome, messy, tasty, oh I could go on and on! The brioche bun was nice and light and so the whole burger didn't leave that heavy feeling you sometimes get in your stomach. I had the Chorizo chilli burger, my only gripe was that it had no spice kick whatsover. The relish was tasty and sweet, but there was no chilli kick ;-( The chips were really good too! Crispy skin on, nicely salted, couldn't really taste the rosemary but that didn't bother me. Prices are on the high side though. \u00a32.50 is a bit much for chips. I mean, really, they are only fried potatoes....Although the price clearly does not put people off, there was a queue outside the place at 12:30pm today, and it was raining!If P&B keep up what they are doing so well for a bt longer, they can all retire in about 5 years!Overall, I will return once a month until I have sampled each burger off the menu!! (actually maybe sooner, like tomoza......) Defo recommmend!",

    "text": "Just came back from a fairly unpleasant visit to say the least.When we were seated it took about 10 minutes to order. The tall brunette waitress got our order wrong (and I heard she got the order wrong on the table next to us aswell, a group of three guys who were charged 2 extra coke's they had ordered but she never brought out). After about 30 minutes she came out with one Ari Gold burger and one Chili-something burger and 2 fries, we ordered 2 Ari Golds. She apologized, what the heck, it happens I thought. After about 15 minutes the burger I ordered came out. She handled it very sloppy. When she handed it over to me, a few drips of burger juice landed on my shirt and lap, she didn't apologize, maybe she didn't see it, I don't know. The burger itself was a complete mess with no real structure., it fell apart after the first bite. I've lived in Chicago for a year and this burger is not even in my top 10. Personal preference but I don't like brioche buns at all, they are just to sweet. There were pickled onions on the burger to counter-act with the sweetness of the bun but far too little. The fries were great. She cleaned up our table and asked if everything was OK. I said \"Can we get the bill please?\" and she said sure. 10 minutes later, no bill. Then I asked one of the guys who worked there for the bill and I got it 30 seconds later.The guys who worked there were great. My brother Shazam:ed a song that was playing inside but didn't get a match. One of the guys saw it and went to the computer, got the name of the track and wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to my brother. Very nice of him!",

Close to 12 there was a pretty big queue and people were coming to pick up phone orders.As soon as it opened I was seated quickly and ordered within a few minutes. My burger and wings came very very quickly. I guess I was one of the first to order.The wings were pretty good. Nice deep crunch and lovely and moist. The sauce was a little funky for my taste but overall they were nice.The burger was solid. I did feel the patty wasn't browned enough. It just didn't have that beautiful exterior crust us burger fiends love. It was beautifully moist though. Like ridiculously wet. I think the guys might need to tone down the fat ratio perhaps. I did feel it was slightly undercooked - for a medium rare it just felt too raw. The patty \u00a0wasn't salted enough. Just needed a tiny bit to give the beef a bit of a flavour boost - was a tad bland. The beefyness just wasn't there.Overall it was a good burger. I've eaten at all of the places in London and Lucky Chip absolutely blows it away.",

The cheese sauce on the gold makes it my usual at this place. As a burger loving girl, this place (which was in walking distance of my flat - dangerous), was great. The patties are cooked perfectly, and the additions to the burgers are all good options. The rosemary chips were delicious and a great add to the burger greatness. The meal is usually about \u00a310, which for a great burger in London, is about normal. Overall, one of my favorite burgers in London, and when I finally make it back there, I will go again. Be warned: the queue at lunch and dinner is LONG, but if you go at random times, it isn't too bad. It's also crowded seating, but it works with the atmosphere.",

    "text": "The BEST BURGER ON THE PLANET is the Ari Gold at Patty & Bun. I've eaten hundreds of burgers in my lifetime and have been in pursuit of the perfect burger for some time. This burger is it. You'll see a long line outside of Patty & Bun and that's an indication that I'm not the only one who's discovered this secret. The Ari Gold features a perfectly cooked beef patty, gooey melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, ketchup, smokey P&B house-made mayo, and a brioche bun. Don't forget to throw on some tasty bacon to add that last bit of flavor heaven. The Ari is a melt in your mouth juicy, cheesy, salty, and tender masterpiece. The pillowy bun seems to melt with each bite and the ratio of the ingredients creates a perfect texture where none of them overpower the burger, while and all of them contribute to the flavor profile. The ingredients are well thought out, portioned appropriately, and are high quality. The trick to the Ari is the cheese + bun + beef all being perfect. Add on the bacon, smokey mayo, and the rest of the ingredients that are all amazing too and the Ari Gold takes the definition of 10 out of 10 and turns it up to 11. If you are in London you must go to Patty & Bun. The burger was so great that I couldn't believe it...so I had a second to confirm it was indeed the best burger on the planet.",

I had to take off a star because of this, everything else is straight 5s.The service is great and the burger is the best I have had in London. The patty is divine, the bun holds up... Have to admit we went double patty due some serious hunger... It was so worth the food coma. Also if you can, get the chicken wings, they are insane.

    "text": "I totally admit it: \u00a0I kind of didn't want to bother coming here. I love Honest Burger, and their fries, and I don't need P&B being awesome and confusing the issue. That said, P&B had a few other things going against it from the outset. All the hype, for one. The wait, for two. It was cold, and we had to wait outside for a table. There were no heat lamps (I kind of find this one unforgivable - keep your fans comfortable, it's not so hard is it?). And you had to stand, in line formation, shuffling along as those in front were painstakingly slowly ushered inside to warm burger goodness.I was feeling especially fickle that night, so I begged my husband to jump ship. I was hungry, I didn't want to wait. Thankfully, the hostess was super-nice, and checked on us line people regularly, offering updates and generally making sure we didn't feel forgotten, fingers frozen, bellies empty. They also had a clever little sign out --\"Risk it for the brisket\" to advertise their special -- that made me smile despite my growing, hunger-fueled rage. And their menu is simple yet diverse (chicken wings, brisket, mushroom burger, etc).Finally, we were provided a table and shouted our order to the first person who came anywhere near us: the Ari Gold, medium well, and the Smokey Robinson, no mayo, med-rare, two rosemary chips, one coke. Now! Please! Yesterday!Thankfully it only took about 10 minutes for our food to show up -- no plates here, just a burger in a wrapper, and when I asked for extra ketchup it arrived real quick like. My burger was cooked correctly and so was my husband's -- a simple but important factor. I thought I would hate the brioche bun (you need some substance to a good burger bun) but it held up fine and did not introduce an odd taste into the mix (as I thought it would). I didn't love it either, though. I don't find it to be a game changer for burgers, and I don't view it as the selling point so many others seem to.So, their onions are pickled and their smoky P&B mayo incorporates BBQ sauce, together giving the overpowering flavor of tangy vinegar. Personally, I really, really didn't like it. They do have regular mayo so if you're like me, I'm sure you can sub the P&B version for regular. My final conclusion is that I'm glad I stuck it out in the end, but I wouldn't do that wait again.",

Our 30min wait wasn't too onerous and we soon headed into the small 30 seater restaurant to pick from a simple yet mouth watering menu.There's no plates, just paper cups for chips and paper bowls for coleslaw. The simplicity of it means that there is a fast turn around yet we didn't feel like we'd been rushed in and out. Sauce was all over the wrapper on my \"Smokey Robinson\" burger and it was really tasty, bacon, caramelised onions, a burger patty that was just pink enough in the middle surrounded by a brioche bun, mmm.The atmosphere was really laid back, tunes were pumping out of a laptop and the rosemary skin on chips were devine. I've read that the ingredients are British where they can be (which is great), so there was no doubt why people were queuing down the road for a table in this simple yet delightful burger joint on James Street. Oh and they do takeaway!",

So I showed up with my sister for a work lunchtime and it was a good thing she had been in the queue before 12pm because it was already half-way down the block. We sat and quickly chose the chicken burger each and fries to share. It's not a cheap burger, by the way, it'll cost you. They came out wrapped in paper, no plates, and looked messy and delicious. And it was so so good. But jesus, the garlic sauce regret that followed. I've never smelled so badly or burped so much garlic in my life. I'm surprised I still can't taste it months later or that anyone in my office still agrees to be sat near me. For the love of God, avoid ordering anything with the garlic mayo on it here.",

It's a little hipster, but somehow manages to also be no-nonsense.The burgers are dirty by design, no haute cuisine silliness here. The cheese oozes, the sauce drips, and the patty tastes good! I usually go for the Smokey Robinson (BBQ goodness), but the Ari Gold is a good option as well. My secret to never being disappointed is not ordering fries with my burger and getting the melt in your mouth, absolutely beautiful Winger Winger Chicken Dinner wings as a side instead. It works, trust me!!Good selection of drinks including ones you may not find everywhere (like Ting).Small menu, but it's all you need for a burger joint.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Patty & Bun and to this day, I think it is one of the best lamb burgers I think I have ever tasted.We got there early as we had tried to go previously however the queue was pretty long. This time that we went, we got there for 5pm so it was still fairly early. We were seated straight away and after about 5-10 mins we had ordered. (I think it helped that I researched the menu beforehand)! Both of us ordered the Lambshank Redemption burger (cleverly named) and shared a portion of sweet potato fries. The food came on a tray with the burger wrapped in paper (reminiscent of a fast food restaurant) which said 'Bite Me' on the inside which I thought was quite cute. The lamb burger was divine. Not too greasy and melted in your mouth. The sweet potato fries were well seasoned and were not that greasy either. Before going to Patty & Bun, and seeing the queue, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. However after eating there and having such a good meal I was pleasantly surprised and also I understood the hype! It is a small restaurant however the food is great as is the service and I would definitely recommend visiting if you are in the area!",

I will never understand why people choose to go to Shake Shack when they could be dining at London's very own Patty & Bun. Alright guys and girls, it's not a particularly elegant affair. It's hands on. It's going to be messy. You are probably going to need to be garden hosed after eating here but it's worth every little bit of hassle. The Ari Gold burger is the one I always go for. Rosemary fries plus coleslaw on the side and, if I'm feeling extra hungry or generous with my cash, THUNDER THIGHS!I've never had to queue at this place but I have walked past when there are queues and let me tell you... there are sometimes people waiting down the street 3 or 4 doors down trying to get a table here. So plan accordingly if you don't have the luxury of queueing for an hour.I do wish they had a better drink selection. Shakes would be a great addition to the menu and for some reason, the beer of choice here is Red Stripe. Oh well. I suppose nothing is perfect so all things considered, it's a small price to pay.",

    "text": "I wanted to try one of Londons best burger places, and had read various reviews trying to figure out which to visit. I have previously eaten at MeatLiquor and Lucky Chip, favouring the latter. Naturally, I had very high expectations for Patty and Bun and my expectations were further encouraged by the long queue outside. We were there on a Thursday night around 9pm, and had to queue 50 minutes before getting a table. The staff were not particularly efficient in keeping tables occupied, and several tables were empty for a full 20 minutes before we were seated (considering that this place serves all its food in disposable serveware, this seems unnecessary).I ordered the Jose Jose burger, which is the same as the signature Ari Gold cheeseburger, with the addition of a chili chorizo sauce. We also ordered chips with chicken skin mayo. My burger was cooked perfectly ( I asked for medium rare), but the meat itself wasn't particularly flavourful. While the texture of the burger was very good, I am sad to report that none of the different burger components tasted as much as I had hoped. Also, the burger was definitely on the greasy side - to the point where it became difficult to eat without it falling apart. I agree that a good burger should be greasy, but this was excessive.I had hoped for much more from Patty and Bun, and can sadly not join in with the reviews proclaiming this London's best burger :(",

Get there before last orders- 45mins before closing, the chefs will not even entertain the idea of your order, which you have to respect given how busy it is constantly. + All three burger patties were juicy and perfectly medium (you are asked your preference), which frankly some larger places just seem to fail at. Brioche buns were fresh and not dry or oiley. The only criticism was the Smokey Robinson wasn't smokey, and I think it's purely because it's drowning in everything else. In fact the 'Ary Gold was smokier, and also finger-licking good. - Too messy. BUT they give a searingly citrusy moist towelette at the end of the meal which cleans it all right off. Get your fingers in there! (Definitely an interesting date moment).+ Chips/fries were delicious, and home cut from actual potatoes (could see the skin) and tossed in delicious Rosemary salt seasoning. + Their own P&B mayo is delicious.+ Get a Wray n Ting, or grab a nice small bottle of Red Stripe to cleanse your palette.Special: 'Get the Duck Out'; brioche bun, beef burger patty, crispy duck, apple & coriander slaw. Something something tasty..Approx \u00a315 each for burger, chips and drink. Good value considering many places in London would give you a far less superior burger alone.",

    "text": "Ok, ok, I know I am waaaay behind the trend for queuing at hyped-up burger places in London. I just never think it'll be worth it, or more likely I'm always just too hungry to wait, or even more likely for the UK the weather is just too miserable to stand outside in. But finally the fates conspired to bless me with an early escape from work AND nice weather for queuing AND a non-veggie mate to catch up with (there is a mushroom-based veg option here, but burgers just aren't my veggie friends' first choice plus the ones that don't like mushrooms would be pretty screwed).My mate got there first and promptly messaged me to say the queue would take 45mins and the guy on the door was a hottie - clearly 2 vital pieces of information, both of which helped us decide to stick it out and wait ;)As it turned out, she was right about the hottie but the queue was closer to an hour long and seemed to move in shifts, i.e. every 20mins they'd seat 3 or 4 tables at the same time. With lots to catch up on we barely noticed the time pass, though it'd probably be a different story if the earlier monsoon was still going.We got the table closest to the window, so those still queuing could press their noses up against the glass to stare at our food. With the compact menu on display outside we'd long since made up our minds and a very friendly waitress was happy to take our order right away.By now the anticipation had surely built to mouth-wateringly unattainable levels, right?! But shockeroo - I think this burger damn well lived up to the hype! I went for the Smokey Robinson which was a glorious mess of beef patty plus cheese, lettuce, tomato, yummy smokey secret recipe mayo and caramelised onions (which is what swung it for me) in a surprisingly tasty brioche bun. Ok it comes with bacon too but I err donated that to my mate (so shoot me - I'm just not a bacon fan!).Otherwise I loved every last sauce-dripping-down-your-fingers/hand/forearms bit of it - prepare to get stuck in as there's just no clean way of eating these, which they seem to acknowledge by giving you a stack of napkins and your burger in greaseproof paper instead of a plate. Slightly embarrassing when the waitress comes over to check on you and sees what a mess you've made but hey ho. Defo get the side of chips too - in our token attempt to be good we shared one and the rosemary salt is a winner.The place is cute and compact with cheeky cardboard signs dotted about - but you don't really notice this until your post-queuing single-minded focus on getting a burger inside you is satisfied. It's pricey but not crazy for what you get, so I'll be back the next time my greasy burger cravings hit if I can get there early enough - so naughty but sooo good!!",

Burger is preformed and pre-frozen which results in a dryer, tougher, and way less juicy and flavorful eating experience. Basically the burger was only slightly less tough and chewy than rubber. Also served medium well, not medium rare as ordered. UPDATE: I have been told that the burgers at P&B are not frozen. Fair enough, but this does change the essential flavorlessness and toughness of the patty.Fresh ground beef would undoubtedly raise the experience at Patty and Bun, but also increase the price and time to prepare, which would of course raise the price to the customer.A higher price point could well diminish the appeal to the teens and early 20's crowd that make up the majority of the Patty and Bun customers, and this obviously would be bad for the owners, and presumably their families.",

The burgers were juicy and cooked to perfection (we ordered them medium rare). The flavors were amazing. \u00a0The price was yet another plus to this burger. It was quite a deal for such a quality restaurant burger. I've had more expensive burgers that don't come close in comparison. The flavors were what you would expect from a $15-20 burger. Also, there's spirits! I was excited about this since I'm more of a fan of these than the usual beer, wine, and ros\u00e9.The atmosphere was also unique, with great music and dim lights. If you aren't a fan of noisier establishments or have small children, don't miss out and order takeaway. I know the loud music is not for everyone, but I loved it and highly recommend it.",

I picked Patty and Bun to celebrate my last meal in the city, and I'm glad I did so! Went here on a Sunday evening, the restaurant is hidden in a corner off of Oxford street and can be a little hard to find, especially because it does not have a big sign. I think there was little bit of a wait but because I was by myself they were able to seat me right away. You order burger and fries separately- which is kind of a bummer (fries and burger are married, one shouldn't have to order them separately). I ordered the mushroom burger and fries. My order took a little longer than normal to come out, but when it did it made me very happy. They have a special house spicy sauce which I thought was delicious too.",

Seriously, the xxx sauce is something special. Even if this place is out of your way, I'd recommend going. This might be one of the best burgers I've had not only in the UK, but in the world.",

    "text": "It's pretty good, Patty & Bun. First good sign was that it was packed - but though we went in the thick of weekday lunch rush, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for the three of us to be seated. \u00a0Quick turnover, ftw!Second good sign was that the veggie portobello burger is described to come with a plethora of fixin's, including but not limited to: *draws breath and clears throat* garlic parsley butter cheese slaw buttermilk baby courgette pickled onions tarragon mayo lettuce. Phew! A lot of stuff. All good sounding stuff, too. The problem with having a lot of stuff is that there is a lot of slidey, slippery mess involved in the burger-eating process. While I'm no stranger to creamy white stuff dribbling on my chin (yep, I went there), I'd prefer to be free of it while eating a meal in public. Also, 'a lot of stuff' meant a lot of flavours, and whether they complemented one another, I will never know. It was just a very overwhelming experience for my little tastebuds. Lastly, we got rosemary chips and coleslaw, which were both delicious, but separate from the burger price. In what world did this become okay??As other people have mentioned, the place itself is kitsch and cute - weird drawings on the walls, wax paper wrapped burgers with no plates on the table, sauces in a big sharing caddy at the front, etc. Fast food meets proper meal (because let's face it, you're still paying a tenner or more).3.5 stars to you, Patty & Bun. You go, P&B.",

    "text": "Patty & Bun. I dream that one day I'll come up with a suitably witty name for a business and then hopefully be able to provide a burger as good as these guys.P&B are a bit hard to find and typically go for a pop-up run at a cool pub or bar. I was lucky enough to find them at Feast last month which excited me to no end. For Feast, they offered up two choices: The Ari Gold and the Smokey Robinson. I had to go for the smoky option and was definitely not disappointed.The Smokey Robinson is a masterpiece boasting a beef patty topped with cheese, tomato, lettuce, \"mounds of caramelised onions\", bacon, ketchup, and smokey P&B mayo all piled onto a brioche bun. That's a whole lot of toppings and makes for a monster burger when you consider the patty itself is in the region of a \u00a0to 1/3 of a pound.It's simply delicious. The top-quality beef burger provides a full meaty flavour that fills your mouth and rolls seductively over your tongue. The sharp salty notes of the bacon and the sweetness of the onions leave you salivating for the next bite and the smokey P&B adds that woody, fresh off the grill, taste that is one of best spices for meat nature ever created. The brioche bun functions perfectly to trap any escaping juices and has enough starchy strength to hold together to the last bite.It took an incredible force of will to share with Tracy L and my mouth still waters to this day for my next P&B burger. Perhaps I'll track them down in their new home (wherever it may be) to sample some of the other burgers, particularly the chilli burger \"Jose\".",

Then when you get inside you're sandwiched shoulder to shoulder between everyone else, and can barely hear yourself think (yes I know I sound like an OAP but it was really unnecessarily loud!) due to the very heavy thumping music. Don't get me wrong, the food was worth a try, but the rest is more of a 'novelty'. Il be getting a take away next time a friend suggests Patty & Bun.",

The Lambshank Redemption burger is absurdly delicious and well worth waiting for, genuinely one of the best things I've ever eaten in London. Also, prepare to be blown away by the chicken wings - it's like slow pulled pork but chicken. It melts off the bone like I've never seen chicken do before. The chicken thighs are pretty spicy, so if that's your thing then you're in luck otherwise go for the wings, they are insanely good. They stop taking take away orders at 10.15pm, but they close at 11pm, so make sure to get orders in before then. Take-away is also super quick, never had to wait more than 10 minutes.",

I loved the laid back atmosphere, the staff were so friendly and the whole place was buzzing. I ordered the Smokey Robinson burger which was probably the best burger I've had in London so far. As usual I got a little carried away when ordering - we had a side of the chicken wings and fries, which we probably didn't need but were a nice addition! Even though there isn't much room to spread out they offer take out which might be a good alternative whilst the weather is so lovely.Highly recommend a visit - great service & fabulous food!",

Queue outside is always a good sign, but with about 7-10 people in front of us we got a table in about 10 minutes Sunday lunchtime - not too bad at all!My friend and I decided to split Jose Jose (burger with chilli chorizo relish) and Robinson (burger with caramelised onions), both were very very good and juicy. TIp: Do flip a burger upside down so that all the juice goes into the top part of the bun and it doesn't go soggy. In the competition Jose Jose vs Robinson, Jose won - it just had more flavour and kick to it. Besides - their hot sauce is great - so make sure you help yourself to it as well.The seating is very small - fits about 30 people at a time, but people come and go rather quickly - definitely kudos to good and professional service.",

Nice ambiance but it feels quite rushed (part of the concept to get the queues moving!!!). Not a great place to for a chat or to relax (which isn't always what you need if you just need a burger!).In terms of the food, I must say the burger was delicious. Maybe not the best I ever had, but it definitely had that US of A feel to it. The brioche is nice and the salad fresh. Speaking of salad, they actually do some quite nice side salads. The only thing I didn't like as much were the sides. Quite average at best.",

My favorite burger is the Ari Gold. It's a cheesy burger with a special Patty & Bun sauce that makes the burgers at P&B burgers distinct and delicious. The Ari Gold is topped with lettuce and the works along with pickled onions. I was hesitant to keep these on my burger the first time I ordered the Ari Gold, but they are now my favorite part! They're unique to P&B and give the burger a tang that is irresistible.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The wait outside the restaurant on James Street is a bummer but I often order burgers for delivery (using Jinn, a delivery app). Patty & Bun is impossible to beat... best burger in London!!",

On Sunday I enjoyed a visit to what I'm led to believe, by both friends and Shortlist, is one of the best of these new burger joints which have sprung up over the last year or so. And my god it's amazing. Staffed by girls and boys who all seemed to be Model kinds of attractive and really nice with it, there was a constant stream of folks queuing to get a seat in the small restaurant to partake in some patties and buns... and the second you sink your teeth into said ingredients you understand why - quite simply the burger that I had here was the best burger I have ever had in my life. Ever. Just the right kind of juicy, just the right level of rare, just the right amount of sweetness in the bun, just the right ... everything. And by right, I mean perfect. It was so good that I had to try really hard not to have a second helping. And almost failed. Can't rate highly enough, there needs to be a six star option for places like P&B.",

Having tried Meat Liquor, Honest Burger and many of the other 'oh so cool' burger joints springing up around London I though it only fair to give this one a go.It did not disappoint, although we waited almost an hour for a table of three the food arrived very quickly and was delicious. The burger was perfectly cooked with a distinctive flavor to it's accompaniments. The Rosemary seasoned fries beautifully off set the burger. A small but well thought out drinks offer - we opted for a Wray & Ginger and it went down a treat. We will definitely return, just with looser clothing.",

Which defies all the reviews I've been reading about this place.Initially, we wanted to go Tommi's but apparently, they're lease ran out so,no tommi's for now. Anyways, they have a burger called smokey Robinson. So clever and the walls are adorned with cardboards with caricatured drawings of guns and machines. No frills. Just on cardboard, and this translates on your dinner as well. No plates, do what you do at mac d's, wax paper, chips out. But more expensive of course.I got the Ari Gold Burger with extra kimchi inside because I was craving a sticky cabbage kick that day, and the burger was good, it was a juice dripping, patty withstanding burger and it was a solid burger. Yet, I felt that it didn't wow me, not like the burger did at bar boulud or kimchi cult, or even meat liquor's dead hippy burger. Maybe, it just needs another flavour kick, pickles, chilli sauce, extra cheese. Just something.But I enjoyed my burger and it really did put me into a burger coma for the next few hours. All these yelp events are totally taking a toll on my weight and eating habits. (I know, WHAT A HARD LIFE ....)",

Knowing how drunk we'd be (and after the crappiest burger ever we had as a break on the way), everyone thought it was a great plan, and we managed to get in with a table for eight for last orders of the night.I got the Jose Jose Chilli Burger and some Rosemary chips. The chips, while tasty, were a bit lacking in the Rosemary flavor to be honest. And the burger was good. Really good. I thought that the mix of toppings on it was really great, but the burger itself was missing something. It just seemed to act as a vehicle for the toppings instead of having delicious burgery flavor as well. The burger was perfectly good though. Really, really red in the middle for that perfect medium rare texture. Nava was a bit unsure about it, but the other half and I will work on her about how she eats her beef.If I were shopping in the area, this would be a great place to stop in for a delicious burger bite to eat.

Distance, it's slightly out the way and 2. I have five guys burger less than 2 mins walk from my house. Prior to going here I was convinced it was going to be just ok and no where near as good as five guys...well I was wrong. The burgers are out of this world. The staff ask how you would like the meat cooked and this is a brilliant touch. I asked for medium and when my bacon burger arrived it was overflowing with juices and sat in a sweet soft bun. The chips are cooked with Rosemary and taste good, portion size is just right. I also tried the wings and I liked them but my friend wasn't too impressed. The meat was sooo soft and they had a lot of sauce on them. Would I return? Hell yeah.",
