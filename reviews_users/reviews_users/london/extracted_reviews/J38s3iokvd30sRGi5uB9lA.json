There is a great choice of breakfast, but unfortunately the smoke salmon tasted like it stayed to long on the counter. As for the eggs, we were not particularly impressed.That said, the atmosphere at Eto is buzzing and their fresh juices are excellent.",

    "text": "Mr. Snarky introduced me to Konditor and Cook, I introduced him to Wardour Street. \u00a0In reality, I hadn't specifically thought of L'Eto, I really just thought about wandering down the street, bakery hopping, drunk on sugar and cake. \u00a0I gave him the option to decide and I think the fact that L'Eto has everything on display in the window was a deciding factor.We went in, were greeted and managed to find a seat. \u00a0We took turns looking at the goodies in the window. \u00a0I wanted to order more than one thing, but I really had to practice some restraint as well. \u00a0In the end I had the Ricotta Cheesecake and the Jasmine Passion Fruit Iced Tea. \u00a0Mr. Snarky had the Honey Cake (apparently their signature cake) and the Mango Passion Fruit Lassi. \u00a0I knew the Ricotta cheesecake would be lighter, but it wasn't nearly as creamy as I was hoping. \u00a0And the raisins were surprise... as always. \u00a0The surprise was the Honey Cake. \u00a0I tried it and I said to Mr. Snarky, \"It tastes just like a Graham Cracker!\" \u00a0He started laughing because it tasted familiar to him, but he couldn't put his finger on it. \u00a0Fortunately I had brought him a box of Graham Crackers for him to compare to! \u00a0My iced tea was very refreshing, but if you are looking for something sweet, you should try something else. \u00a0I figured with a sweet treat, I wouldn't want to go too sweet with my drink. \u00a0The Lassi however was lovely. \u00a0I have never had Lassi and had it not been made with dairy products, I would've ordered one.I think I would need to go back again to try some of their other items before giving L'Eto anymore stars. \u00a0And that is a job I am willing to take!",

I love Princi and have a great relationship with it, and sometimes, their desserts can come out strangely wrong, but L'Eto, man, a miss on 2 of the three items tonight if you want to play in the league with Princi. We went in and ordered the Honey Cake, the Ginger Berry Tea, and the Cherry Kirsch. Honey cake, first off was absolutely divine. Best thing by far that we had that night, but at the same time, REALLY sweet and REALLY a bit overbearing. Overall, a great cake however, and kudos. The Cherry Kirsch, on the other hand was probably the least favorite. In some bits, it had lots of cherry joyfulness. In others, it just fell flat, and too much cream without substance. Thankfully my dinner partner and I had just gone swimming at the Marshall St. baths / spa prior. Last thing on the list was the Ginger Berry Tea. On the whole, it was a great tea, a bit rich for a tea, but a great drink. Maybe Starbucks ought to rip it off...All in all, a decent cafe... I'm glad I finally gave it a shout and tried things in there. I'd say if a quieter atmosphere with decent cakes is what you're after, then come here. If you're looking for a crazy buzz of life and noise and cake goodness, visit three doors down.3*. Good, but not good enough yet.",

    "text": "The perfect treat to myself after 40 days of no-dessert Lent! Wow, I took forever to pick out my cake but that's not surprising with so many choices... ended up with a Mascarpone-cream/plum flavored cake (forget its exact name) and it was simply heavenly: the cake sheets were Napoleon-like pastry texture with A LOT of light fluffy cream filling - this is for you, truly sweet-toothed! \u00a0My favorite part was the cream but it is above and beyond sweet! The plum flavoring adds that subtle fruity distraction. My friend had a much easier time choosing - thank goodness he picked one I also was debating about so I got to taste it: really really delicious as well, in a different way: the caramel cake. Thicker, less sweet, more cake/less cream - the caramel was definitely there though not overpowering. Excellent overall! Can't wait to go back to try some of the other ones. Though there are a good number of other bakeries just up and down the street... Dangerous block!",

CREAM?) and they aren't well made, nor worth the price they are asking.

Not the best decision. Although the portion is huge, the taste was just a bit too boring. Salt and pepper helped a bit, but the for some reason it was just far from what I'd expected from this place. Lantana is definitely much better for scrambled eggs on toast! The coffee I had was better than the eggs on toast - but to be fair, that was not too difficult. I planned to get something sweet afterwards, but after the staff threw out three women with a child, because the child, she was perhaps three or four, screamed a bit, I decided to leave. I don't like screaming children, but well, sometimes children just scream. And I think it's not fair to treat them all like that - even if it is annoying sometimes and some guests might have complained (I don't know if they actually did). Still, I want to try something sweet there! But I guess it won't become my favourite place in Soho. I give it three stars, because I have the hope that the sweets are way better than my eggs on toast.",

Sometimes I spend a good 15 minutes sitting at a table waiting for it to be cleared from the previous patron. While I love a hazelnut latte and a raspberry tart, sometimes it's just not worth the effort. If that is stuff you don't mind, please ignore my review.

Who knows? The staff certainly didn't. After five minutes in the queue we were finally seated, well I should say, ordered to sit at the most narrow table I have ever experienced situated right next to the head of the aforementioned queue. Nothing like having handbags hit you a few times a minute when there are numerous other free tables near by. However the look on the waiters face was very much \"do what you're told\".We then discovered that in order to place an order the queue needed to be joined again... After losing your place and joining the other baffled folks with quizzical expressions for another 5 mins to finally order and pay it seems ludicrous. Another 5 minutes later the cakes finally turned up. As did the volume of the music. All serenity gone and the rage beginning to boil I asked for our order to be put in takeaway boxes as we decanted ourselves to a nearby square in order to rescue the pleasant experience we originally wanted.The cakes are rather good but the staff and service is beyond reproach.",

I tried the famous honey cake, and maybe my expectations were too high from all the reviews, but I thought it was just pretty good and not amazing. The cappuccino was also just slightly better than average. I would be willing to give it another try as there were a few other desserts that looked good. But it's hard when Hummingbird is right next door, and that's hard to beat when I need my sugar fix.",

    "text": "Wardour Street is turning into quite the place for posh (read expensive) bakeries and desserts with chains like north London bakery chain Gail's and exclusive chocolatier Paul A Young opening shops here in the last few months to complement other well-known favourites like Princi and Hummingbird BakeryThe independent (as far as I know) L'Eto is therefore throwing its hat into a crowded ring when it opened its doors with a tempting array of cakes in the window. It does take some of its inspiration from Princi with the kitchen and dining area being open to view from the general public passing byThe cakes look wonderful but aren't cheap, the average hovering around the \u00a34 mark though there is a nice variety including quite a few meringue concoctions which I haven't seen elsewhere.If you fancy something more substantial or savoury, they do have some light meal options in the main cafe area. They were also advertising a breakfast/brunch menu with more American offerings like eggs BenedictI do like my fresh juices and their orange and mint was a delight.There's a reasonable dining area and it seems less rammed than Princi. If you can't stand the crowds, it's worth strolling a little way up the road to have a look at L'Eto",

Would I eat here again - I don't think so.This review is based on their hot breakfast menu. Not their cakes and desert menu. We arrived and it was hustle bustle on a Saturday. The front window display looked very inviting and so did the hot breakfast menu.Great choice of menu for those wanting options with their eggs that are unique and interesting. Scrambled, over easy, poached you name it, it was there. I opted for scrambled eggs, avocado on rye and a side of vegetables along with a soy latte and fresh juice .Food presentation was excellent and the portion sizes were on par but sadly the food was bland and missing something. The juice was watered down and my latte was sent back for 'take two'. I thought the ambience was enjoyable however the freshness of the food and overall taste didn't match it's surroundings and for this it gets 3 stars.",

    "text": "Summary: + Dessert hit and miss + Small cafe + The best thing about this place is the cake display from outside + Free WiFi + Go to Princi or Gails if going for a dessert around here Overall: I went to this small caf\u00e9 with great cake display for a tea (and naturally, a cake). Modern and slightly cheap d\u00e9cor reminds me of a breakfast corner of a travel hotel that also multi functions as a bar in the evening. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Somehow the place smelled funny. I think it was kitchen garbage. I'd worked in restaurants before so I'm familiar with the smell. They also have a small salad section like an after thought at the counter. But I wonder if people even notice. I bet most people are lured in to this place by the gorgeous cake display in front. Also, their seating system is a little confusing. I had been here a few times but I still don't know if I'm supposed to secure a seat and then order at the counter or the other way round. Staff are not around to advice either way. Food:My friend and I strategically picked different cakes so we get to taste two. I went for a tiramisu and my friend had ricotta cheesecake. Ricotta cheesecake was good. The thin biscuit base was perfect. Rich and moist. The cake was light but had a funny grainy texture like there are bits of sugar not quite blended in properly to the cake mixture. I wasn't sure about the dried raisins either. The gummy texture and the excessive sweetness of raisins do not add much to the cake. I'm something of a purist when it comes to desserts. So I'd rather have a simple recipe executed perfectly than half-baked flare of random creativity. The way I see it is, there are two ways to use fruits in a dessert situation. One is to add texture and the other is to add sharpness to contrast the sweetness of dessert. Berries are popular for these reasons as they have both juicy texture and pleasant sourness that compliments sweet. I didn't see any of these positive effects from the raisins. Tiramisu was a pure disaster, I'm afraid. Even before I had my first bite, I could see water was oozing out from the bottom layer. As I suspected, this cake was too wet and could hardly maintain its shape. The main cheesecake layers were so runny. The finger biscuit layers in between soaked up so much water that they felt like a sponge in my mouth. (Not that I've ever eaten a sponge before.) I could not finish this horrible water tiramisu. No, hand on. I actually did finish it. But that's just because I'm programmed to finish food in sight. I cursed my mother's teachings as I shoved down this baking disaster down my throat. Next time I see her, I will have to negotiate adding amendments to the age-old rule that allows me to NOT finish food where the quality of food in question is below certain standard. Conclusion: The best thing about this caf\u00e9 is the gorgeous cake display. Best to enjoy it from outside.",

We had intended to eat breakfast at another popular place around the corner, but waiting in line was not desirable. Mom took a spin around the block and found L'Eto. Absolutely quaint and appealing.I am not a big desert person, but I was so impressed by the array of yummy offerings that you see in many of the photos posted. We were strictly on the hunt for a proper breakfast and found it here! Though I love Europe, coffee and pastries for breakfast just doesn't cut it for me. I need more as it is truly the most important meal of the day! Egg dishes, oatmeal. Granola, fruit, pancakes....they have it all! This was a happy accident and I would gladly seek this place out each time that I am in London!",

Two friends and I went here for lunch, they had something from the salad bar (which was ready to be served) whilst I ordered Eggs Royale and a croissant as I was fancying breakfast-y foods. So we all sat down, my friends had food already (as expected) and I was waiting for mine. They were eating REAAAAALLY slowly just to make sure I wouldn't eat on my own and they were taking breaks and chat. But there's only so much you can stall. Anyway, when they were about two thirds of the way through their meal (it ad been half an hour by then) the guy who took my order came over and said he had forgotten what I had order and if I could please repeat it?ARE YOU SERIOUS?So I did, and kept waiting. It took them 20 more minutes to put two poached eggs on a piece of toast (muffin? Don't even remember), which I had to eat extremely quickly as we all had to get back to work and my friends had finished eating for quite some time by then. The food was good, I'll give them that. But I'm not happy to pay what I did if at least the service isn't up to scratch. Will not be going back.",

Its based in bustling soho, on a street teaming with people so not suprisingly L'eto is a busy place. We were lucky to get a table for 2 at 4pm! Don't be pjt off by the queue though, its a tad confusing; the queue is a mix of both people off the street looking to take food away as well as seated people queuing at the till to order. This would be my main quibble about L'eto is that if they had table service for those seated (there are lots of staff walking around) the queue could be reduced and it wouldnt be quite so intense in there!However the cakes....my goodness. They really are worth any queuing. I had the raspberry tart - the cream was thick and tasted faintly of mint and vanilla, lovely sweet raspberrys on top of a tart/cake. Delicious. My friend went for the chocolate cupcake which looked immaculate- i had a little taste of the chocolate cream on top- and it really was to die for- a real treat. Somehow these cakes dont make you feel stuffed! They are just perfect so you ca n finosh every morsle. I'd suggest going for a treat- be aware of its for a special, they play very loud music so its not the smot for an intimate moment!!",

Moreover, they had great availability of all of their dishes as they replace all of the presented dishes that has finished with new ones right away.We had their FAMOUS signature cake *the honey cake* it was the BEST cake i ever tasted in my whole entire life! No kidding! It contained honey yet it didn't taste too sweet, the flavour was just right in every layer it has. I would give it 20/10 ! The main dishes that were presented looked delicious too, yet after having that honey cake in reverse made the thought of having a main dish right after it a bit of too much. \u00a0 \u00a0My only advise: don't jump on having the honey cake if you were hungry even though they are selling out quickly, have your food first then enjoy it as your rewarding desert!

I ordered the same as the first two times, poached eggs with spinach and avocado, and they gave me 2 leaves of spinach and said they run out of it. My husband order the French toast, it was awful and they didn't put any syrup on it, so when we asked for some to try to save the dish, they charged us 2 pounds, so make sure to NOT order the French toast, it's a huge waste of money. Staff is friendly, and service is fast. It would be 5 stars for us if wasn't for the last visit and the horrible French toast that comes with no syrup.",

    "text": "We made reservations for a Saturday around 1 pm. It was pretty full, but no line, so I'm not sure that you absolutely need them.It's a pretty tiny place and it has a steady flow of customers. I've only been during the day and I'm not sure if the night is more crowded or less.The servers were nice and answered questions, although one server was a bit too eager with his countless suggestions of what to order. They were also very accommodating with our request to move tables. One of the biggest cons to this place is that most of the chairs are stools, so they don't have backs. I happen to find this quite uncomfortable and when a table opened up that had backs available, we were able to switch.Granny smith pancakes served with fresh berries, vanilla cream, and fruit compote. These were completely delicious and not too sweet at all as can be a huge problem with brunch foods. Small portion, but fantastic.Egg white omelette with spinach & tomatoes, served with sourdough toast. This was the best egg white omelette I've had. Completely not oily, but great flavor. The spinach and tomato was balanced throughout. The bread came toasted and buttered, which I didn't want, so they kindly exchanged it for a piece without any butter. It's also served with a small cute of feta cheese, which I didn't really understand. It was tiny and was sitting in a cup of olive oil. The rest was delicious and I'd highly recommend it if you want something lighter.Flourless chocolate cake - looked rich and dense, but had such a weird flavor. I'm not sure if it was the fact that it was labelled gluten free? Flourless chocolate cakes are naturally gluten free, but usually not labelled as such and don't have this odd taste. This one was specifically labelled gluten free, which may have indicated that they were simply using a different type of flour instead of a no flour. I'm not sure, but there was a molassesy taste that didn't belong. If it hadn't've been for that, it would've been delicious.Would recommend this place for lunch/brunch/snack for sure.",

Once, my colleague and I wandered in to have a look at their cakes (in our office, the person celebrating their birthday buys the cake - ensuring you are eating something you like) but they were too expensive and there were nothing spectacular on offer.Well, upon someone raving about their honey cakes a few weeks ago, I walked in after work to see only 3 of these honey cakes left at 6:15pm. Duly ordered one to takeaway, noting the eyewatering pricetag of \u00a34.80 (although the cake is a slight generous size) and the gentleman serving was pretty efficient about the whole thing, asking if I needed a plastic fork. No thanks, going to eat it after dinner at home.The most impressive place is really the shop display at the front with all the cakes beautifully laid out. I am not sure it's really worth the price tag though as let's say, I didn't cry out in tears of joy upon tasting this infamous honey cake. It felt like it was too \"soft\" and not enough crunch in it. I ate what I thought were 3 mini almonds inside but apparently my friend was told they were walnuts (weird - walnuts aren't flat?) but this was not enough to counteract the rest of the \"too soft\" cake. It was just the right amount of sweetness and right amount of cream but to be honest, it didn't really blow me away.The tea looks like inside though, may have to come back to try one of their fruit tarts another day with tea and service.",

Everything looks so nice on display, but when you order and receive it on the plate, its nothing special. So this time round I opted for the Chocolate cinnamon cake, i thought it'd be moist, spongey, gooey and delectable. It was neither of those things!!! I had one bite and it was dry as hell, the ganache was just nasty, they also put a bit of rose in there, Whyyyy!!!!! for the love of flipping god, who does that!!!! There was chocolate, cinnamon and rose, bad combination all round! I also ordered passionfruit and ginger tea, and woaaaahhh, it knocked me for 6! It was sour, and so strong as in the ginger would kill you! It was nice, served in a big see through tea pot, with the little blossoms of passion fruit, but woaaaah, I'd never order that again. More so I'd never return to be honest. It's also quite expensive for such little dry, untasty snacks. The service is also meh, they stare at you waiting for you to leave!",

We first both asked for tap water, which never arrived. While we were looking at our menus, three separate waiters asked if we were ready to order. At least they were trying to be attentive, but I did not like the constant hovering. My friend ordered a dish with poached eggs, and she requested them to be fried instead. The waiter told her that would not be possible, the reasons for which will remain a mystery to me. She ended up ordering the Nutella crepes and I had the eggs Benedict, which was decent but nothing amazing. At this point we had asked for our water three times and we were told \"it's coming\". We finally got it halfway through our meal. Overall, I was not pleased with the service or environment and would not recommend this restaurant.",

I love the variety of sweets they have on display and I'm happy to say they are as delicious as they appear to be. We came in on a Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't that busy, but gradually business picked up over the 3 hours we sat around. Their tea selection was very nice; try their oolong tea with just a hint of sugar. Being Soho, this cafe isn't' cheap. Two teas and a slice of cake came to be \u00a313. Still, I would come back again on weekday because it was quiet enough for a lovely chat for me and my friend. And I would want to try more of their cake selection.",

Considering that their crepes were a little dry when I tried those a while ago, I though it was only fair that I update the review to 4 stars but if I was just rating the honey cake it would be 5 stars all the way!Previous review from Aug 2014 (5 stars): With the best variety of cakes that I could ever wish for including a honey cake that is so divine that it truly tastes like a slice of heaven that melts in your mouth so innocent and unassumingly. Not only are the fresh cakes sublime but there is also a variety of freshly made savoury foods, a range of creatively mixed teas and a good selection of fresh fruit juices made to order. So far my experience of the breakfast menu is satisfactory but not special (the crepe was a bit dry for my taste). Incidentally, the toilet is very decent too. Definitely one of the best cake-orientated caf\u00e9s that I've ever been blessed to be in.",

It's right next door to Hummingbird Bakery and I've never even been into Hummingbird because this place is so much better.L'Eto has a variety of fresh sweet items on display in their huge windows and they're so enticing that I often see people walking by stop to take pictures only to give up and go inside instead.I bring everyone here and always get a mille feuille or fruit tart along with a coffee. Their teas are amazing though and you'll definitely suffer a little envy when you see others order pots of mint or fruit teas which are served in glass pots and are literally muddled mint or fruits steeped in hot water. Visually stunning and very fresh though I still generally stick to a coffee because I'm an addict.They also serve brunch here and I've only had the pleasure of dining here once. I ordered Eggs Florentine and it was perfectly cooked. There is table service but you order at the till and pay first. The staff can get a little overwhelmed on busy days but it's a small place and it's easy to get their attention as a result. The streamlined ordering system makes up for how busy they can get so generally you don't wait very long for drinks and you get your cakes right away.Definitely swing by if you're in Soho and keep an eye on how busy it is. On weekends this place can be absolutely packed!",

He is extremely rude. I have now been twice this week and was unfortunate enough to get the same waiter (tall brown guy with slicked back hair). Last time, he charged me almost \u00a320 for 3 scrambled eggs because I added a little ham to it. Didn't see that coming. This most recent time he got my order completely wrong. I was supposed to have melted cheese in my eggs and when he messed up, to \"correct\" the issue he brought cold mozzarella (which is also the wrong cheese). See pic. Not exactly what I had in mind.The above issues would be small but he was incredibly rude. Arguing with me that I didn't order what I did. He gave me something I wasn't even looking at and wasn't similar at all! Would love coming back here but unfortunately the service ruins the experience. The other staff seemed nice so maybe I will try them",

The staff is super friendly, the food is incredible, and dessert is to die for.I got the Italian breakfast -- oyster mushrooms, scrambled eggs, burrata, cherry tomatoes, and sourdough toast. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. My friend ordered the Californian. It was everything it was advertised to be and very good, but unmemorable. It consisted of tortilla chips, fried eggs, queso fresco, guacamole, and pico served over a tortilla. Our food came out quickly, and the service was great. We finished lunch off with dessert. For me, a chocolate fudge cake. For her, the pistachio rose cake. Mine was what I expected -- thick, dense, fudge. Hers was beyond expectation. It was absolutely incredible. Light, fluffy flavors exploded in every bite. We will definitely be going back! Might try something new on the entree menu, but we need more of that cake.",

The tea was not hot and therefore did not get an opportunity to steep, the teacup was dirtied with the lipstick of the patron before, the creamer edges were crusted with some random food, and the silverware soiled. I ordered the orange, honey, and almond semolina porridge, and perhaps the chef mistook the sugar with the salt shaker because the porridge tasted like a very salty and gritty soup base, and this small bowl alone was \u00a37. Unfortunately, a very dismal experience and taste. Perhaps service and cleanliness has nosedived since my last visit...",

    "text": "L'Eto Caffe is a beautiful, casual dining spot where I experienced the most modern elegant food during my entire stay in London.The pastry explosion in the front window did help to draw me in, but I really focused on the breakfast menu during my visit.The options did not excite me at first, but I persisted and took a chance on the scrambled eggs with feta, tomatoes, and avocado tartine. \u00a0My lord it was a revelation! \u00a0I added Bacon, but in hindsight I could have skipped it.The eggs were perfectly soft scrambled, the tartine was incredibly delicious toast that was drizzled with a chili oil, covered with ripe avocado and a sprinkle of toasted sunflower seeds. \u00a0There was a little disc of feta in olive oil and herbs on the side, a condiment I suppose. \u00a0And then a little salad of quartered cherry tomatoes in a little dish on the plate.A side of fresh orange juice was perfectly done, other juice combos are available.If you're looking for the full English breakfast experience, go elsewhere. \u00a0If you want something amazing, give it a try!",

Since they serve breakfast until 5, that shouldn't be hard to do.We started with coffee - absolutely adored my Spanish latte with toasted hazelnutsBetween 2 of us, we Ordered the ham croissant with poached egg, the oyster mushroom croissant and the savoury French toast. Fortunately, we decided to see what arrived and the sizes before ordering one of their global breakfast platters. Wise decision.The servings are standard size, but that glorious cheese! Completely fills the tummy. We had to forego all plans of a breakfast platter, dessert and even a second coffee. That's how stuffed we were!While they have tables, seating is on stools (no backs), unless you lean against the wall. So not a place I'd be able to take my older parents - they need comfortable chairs to enjoy their meal. But we will definitely be back. The Californian and Turkish breakfast platters are calling my name",

I tried the original and pistachio leche and they are glorious.. I have never tried anything as good as this. I also tried the layer cake but they are not as yummy as the dulce de leche. I tried the caramel layer cake among others they have. A nice drink to have with your cake is a cup of warm Japanese sencha. It tastes authentic and bitter, which I prefer with any green tea.",

My dad got a cappuccino, and it was so beautiful he didn't want to drink it! He said it was the best cappuccino he ever had, too! He also said that his soft - boiled eggs were over cooked... but let's not ruin the moment. The cakes in the window looked crazily amazing (crazemazing????), and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food. Some of the coffees even came as a see-through cup with milk in an erlenmeyer flask with the espresso in a tiny beaker so you could make your own concourse. GENIUS!!! This place is amazing and whoever says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about!",

My overall description for their pastry is something you give to a boss you don't like: Looks pretty as a present, doesn't taste that great (so insulting but not as obvious) and basically an express ticket for diabetes. (NB. Did not experience their service, coffee and other food items so my review does not cover those.)",

You'll get a lot more options and cost a lot less. The chocolate hazelnut cake is like a very light Nutella mouse with a thin crispy crust at the bottom. The green tea lychee cheese cake has a very pronounced lychee flavor albeit it tasted a little artificial after a while. The Caribbean carrot cake seemed a little dryer than what I'm used to at first; but it definitely grew on me later. The creamy filling and the mango jam on top really made on favorite of the three. I wish I had the stomach to try some others; I'll have to wait until my next visit.",

I ordered the rose and lychee cake, the almond and lemon cake and the caramel cake. The rose/lychee and the almond/lemon cake were so good and moist! Usually pretty desserts are much less tasty, but these two cakes had me pleasantly surprised! I would order these two over and over again! The caramel cake had a weird texture (almost like baklava) and the flavor wasn't that great. They have a large selection of interesting flavored desserts from pies to cakes to brownies and souffl\u00e9s! The shop itself is also very cute and whimsical! The three desserts I ordered was a total of about 19 pounds, so it is a bit pricey but I expected that just by looking at the shop.",

    "text": "L'eto is honestly one of the best places to go for cake. You can't not try their signature honey cake plus their tea and coffee selection is quite unique. But he warned there are times when it is full so you will wait anywhere from 5-20 minutes. Overall I highly recommend it as the staff are pleasant people to interact with and the selection of cake is quite numerous. The cakes, also not too rich (unless you go for the chocolate fudge cake then yeah its heavy) but if you happen to go often enough you might find something special that time of year to try out. So its always an experience.",

The music was Christmas songs and other nice modern ones (Adele for example...)The staff was really nice and friendly. However, the service was REALLY slow which made me a bit disappointed. We were three people: two of us were served and the last one has to wait more than 15 min to be served (after we asked a waitress for it). I understand than all the orders can't arrive at the same time but more 15 minutes difference it's a lot...Most important: the food! Everything was really tempting on the menu! I chosed the poached eggs with an almond milk cappucino and a rose and lychee cake on the side. l'Eto Caffe has a HUGE cakes choice and they all look good! (I will come to try more for sure...)I recommend this place for a nice brunch or a small tea time break in the afternoon. Nice place, nice food and nice people. A good combo :)",

    "text": "We came here for brunch. The food was bland on texture and taste. I'd describe the Arabic as a plate of mush. There were large dips put on flatbread- you couldn't get to because the dips were on them. The texture of all was identical as it had been made in a Thermomix. My partner had California which was essentially nachos with an egg - \u00a0and more mush. Finally, after paying \u00a36.50 for a coffee, we were charged 30pm for a 30mL soy milk to go with it. Petty, given the cost of our brunch. Atmosphere and service did not make up for bad food",

The menu is beautiful and dedicated to this \"brunch\" foods. The service was nice, come here if you have time to chill because the food and drink is worth the wait. Beautifully decorated, so funky, modern, cozy vibes through out the space. Small staff, huge flavor, fun atmosphere, fun music soundtrack. Ambiatic, i will be returning here on my next visits.",

    "text": "I was walking to Princi when L'eto Caffe's window display of tempting desserts caught my eye. I then looked up and admired their interior: dark wood and black with silver accents, brightly lit and welcoming. I decided to stick with the plan and go to Princi anyway, but the lack of seating quickly convinced me to go back and give L'eto Caffe' a try. We got a burata salad, burata cheese with tomatoes and rocket, and polenta (in pie form) with sundried tomatoes. Both needed seasoning quite badly, so I asked for salt and pepper grinders. The first salt grinder didn't work that well, and I ended up switching and wrestling with two others until I found one that worked. Coffee looked gorgeous in Bodum Pavina double-walled glasses, but was mediocre and disappointing. Since they just opened, I would assume that they are still working out their kinks, but until then, I'll be going to Princi.",

We didn't have a go with any savoury dishes, but only had two of the sweet treats of the window: the meringue tart and the brownie. The second was a very moist and chocolatey version, well-executed and overall very satisfactory. Now the tart... I don't think I have ever tasted quite anything like it. Perhaps inspired by a Sicilian cassata, it encrusted a wildly tangy mix of red berries in perfect pastry (between shortcrust and puff!..) and sweet meringue. I still don't know if I liked it really, but it's great to have a new place around that dares to offer new tastes. On the drinks front, the relatively overpriced jasmine green tea was great, flattie says, and my bottled pink lemonade was more or less what I expected. We'll definitely be there again, as it's a refreshing alternative to the very crowded atmosphere of Princi, if one doesn't feel like it!",
