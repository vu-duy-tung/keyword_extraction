As it is part of the Jazz Club you do often here the live performances whilst sitting/eating upstairs, which really adds to the ambiance of the place. Its quite a loud and energetic place to eat anyway, and always the food is good, and more than reasonable the staff seem to be help on tap which always makes you feel rather important.",

The pizza express on the ground floor is exactly what you expect but there is a back entrance down some steps into the basement that lead into a dark jazz caf\u00e9 where they serve pizza express food which you eat whilst listening to live jazz music. The whole venue has a real jazzy feel to it and it has bee open for decades! There is an old banner on the wall advertising a live jazz night back in the 70s showing that the price of pizza and the jazz is about \u00a32!!! Of course things have changed since then and it is a lot more expensive than that. Most nights cost about \u00a315-\u00a320 per person plus the cost of the food on top of that. So not a cheap night out, but definitely worth every penny if you choose to see a great artist. They have booklets with their programs on the tables and performance listings on their website as well, so make sure to choose something you think you' enjoy!",

Prices are reasonable and the service was fantastic. Try it out!",

First of all, If you are going to get pizza from a chain pizza store, I suggest you go to Pizza Express as they actually care about the pizza they serve.In true jazz style, the jazz club is located downstairs in the basement. This club has become somewhat of an institution in the London jazz scene, and has hosted some of the best acts from London and abroad. The club is typically dark and a bit raw, just the right kind of aesthetic for the music.Because the place hosts such a high calibre or performers, tickets are often quite expensive. Unless you are a die-hard jazz fan, maybe reserve it for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I was visiting London from the States, and wanted something takeaway for just hanging out at the hotel for dinner.Found this place via Yelp, and it was in the neighborhood; the beauty of it was that it forced me to walk through Soho, which was the neighborhood behind the hotel. Soho, though very discreet in the daylight, was pleasantly abuzz with activity in the evening. I would never have known this otherwise! Being a foreigner in a foreign land, of course, I was expecting a fairly generic takeaway establishment, though when I arrived, \u00a0I was surprised at the intimate (yet bustling) ambience with low-level lighting, and 30-something crowds coming here for date-nights or group dinners. I was amazed!I ordered both the Margherita (tomato and mozarella) and American (pepperoni) pizzas - in addition to the Nostrana Salad (New potatoes, torn chicken breast, avocado, red peppers, green beans, mixed leaves, parsley and a free range egg, served with house dressing).Since I walked to the restaurant to order, rather than call, I waited for the food on a still (where I people-watched!), and it took less than 20 minutes, which I thought, was reasonable.The food was good. The pizzas, as I expected, were Italian-style and not at all like American pizzas (thinner crust yet doughy, and less toppings); the crust was warm and doughy. The salad, was great, and all of the ingredients tasted really fresh!Had the timing been right for me in my schedule, I would've have loved to take in some jazz.",

I love to hate restaurant chains, but despite the dominating presence in UK high streets and the formulaic menu, the food is always consistently great at Pizza Express. It can be a brilliant asset to know that if you are in the middle of a hideous high street and needing decent food, the Pizza Express there will be of a standard that you are familiar with. So when I was invited by my company chairman to the Dean Street branch for live music I was more than happy to go. Most of my friends would not touch the place with a barge pole due to the Jazz played there. Last night far exceeded my expectations for the talent on the bill. A fantastic fusion of Funky Jazz, Pop, Latin and Cuban feels from Marc Antoine/Paul Brown/Jessy J, that frankly was some of the best live music I had seen for a while in London. The atmosphere was intimate, which was without a doubt expounded by the formidable Jessy J playing sax solos that wound their way among the audience. Service here was only very average. I am still waiting on the chilli oil that I requested to go with my pizza. Which incidentally was the same pizza that got very cold 3 minutes after it was served because the air conditioning was blowing directly on it!",

We had a couple of pizzas on those slightly thinner, stretchier bases, and a couple of salads to start, and it was a welcome relief not to have service automatically included for a change. And to spend under \u00a350 on our tea. So yes, I liked coming here. The only thing I didn't like was the rumbling of the jazz coming from downstairs. It shook my chair and made my tummy feel funny.

The staff in here are delightful, and even if you don't sit in the jazz area, there's always something good to hear over dinner. The pizza is Pizza Express pizza, i.e. brilliant for the price and always piping hot. It's also worth noting that this branch is just around the corner from Soho Square, where on a sunny summer's day you can relax and let your food go down while sitting in the grass.",

My friends and I showed up for a lunchtime jazz gig by Earl Okin on a bank holiday Monday. You go through the typical Pizza Express restaurant and downstairs to a dark jazz bar with a little stage. It's kinda weird. There were only about 20 people in the club but it was a sunny day so that's to be expected. I would recommend ordering before the show starts as it's so awkward trying to flag down waiters and order while someone is performing 5 feet away. You are also eating in the dark, which is a little peculiar. But the show was great and I loved hearing him play. If you are a real proper jazz fan then this might be a little too mainstream and 'play the hits' for you.",

I just can't love it hugely because I think other London places like street food stalls or new pop ups or independent small restaurants are doing great things that have upped the pizza game. So, I think I'd only go back to pizza express be uses of the deals they have. Nice to have around though.",

It was yummy I won't lie but it was almost so thin that I couldve eaten two! I give it 4 stars because it did take me to flavour town and that's what it's all about in the end for me .... I Also had \u00a0the snowball dough balls which were wayyyyyy too doughy but you know what? They made great ping ping balls! So overall it was a win win",

It's very intimate with max 35 tables. No matter where you sit you are very close to the stage. The food was also quite good. I didn't expect very much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Our pizzas had a thin crust base that was very crispy. The toppings were good too. In the end we paid less then \u00a3 70 for 2 pizza, one bottle of wine and some starters. Good value if you think that you are getting this with some great entertainment on the side.",

The prices are pretty budget friendly and you can drink some pretty good wine too. I got pasta while my boyfriend got pizza and they were both good. I did not need the dough sticks that they are \"famous\" for. \u00a0It was just aight. These things are everywhere and I'd say if you have the choice to go somewhere else go for it. THey also gave me a coupon for 30% to try some pizza by Valentine's which I'm assuming is a famous chef. I won't use it- anyone want it?",

Now, probably like most people these days I refuse to eat in Pizza Express without a Taste card or a voucher (& I do like a voucher!) but I have to admit if you don't know where to go or have no other option or just fancy a decent meal; some wine and a place to chat, then this is the place to be. I can't visit P.Ex. without partaking in a 'Padana', it's simply delish! Everytime I've had something else, I've missed my favourite pizza and felt like I was almost being unfaithful to my first love in pizza. You can also have (believe it or not) tasty and filling salads (recommend the Pollo); delightful little doughballs and scrumptious desserts too - and then feel like you need to be rolled out! Ah well, the diet (always) starts tomorrow. \u00a0This branch is always busy with a great atmosphere, speaking of which I'm dying to return to check out the Jazz Club here, and the service has always been really good and friendly. Located in the heart of Soho with plenty of post-dining options for a drink or two or maybe a theatre visit, what more could you ask for?!",

The regular Pizza Express restaurant sits atop the Jazz cafe. The basement is transformed into a unique Jazz cafe & you dine on Pizza Express menu. My only qualm is that the menu is more expensive than other Pizza Express's- thus my 4 star rating. I am already paying for a jazz ticket so why do you need to hike up the price of the pizza menu? I could understand if we were not paying for a jazz ticket but we are already paying a premium. It seems unfair to use a menu that cost more. Regardless this is an awesome place to listen to Jazz- a very intimate cool venue. I would definitely take people here from out of town because its a unique experience in London.",

The name made us wary, but instead of being a greasy pizza chain, the restaurant was actually quite nice (though crowded). The pizza was large, but also very thin, and we all enjoyed our meal immensely. I'd say this is like a classier CPK. Good bang for you buck. Service was kind of rough at first, but the waiter grew nicer as the meal progressed.",

After all, it's a chain.However, since attending a great event with Francesco Mazzei in East LDN to show off his special range of rustic Italian recipes, I've promised to be more open-minded.It's not like I've stopped going. PE is a great stop for when you want freshly-made, quick pizza. The pasta isn't great, but the salads aren't bad, and Mazzei's attention to detail in his chosen ingredients are admirable.I then attended an event last week that was part of the new generation music programme at PE, designed to showcase the brand's musical heritage.We munched on dough balls ( which never fail to please me) and slices of pizza while listening to two fantastic new artists - Stac and The Simonsound. There's not much I love more than sitting in a dark basement with a glass of wine and some soulful music. That's exactly what I did. It was terribly fun, and I'd definitely go back.Hey, the food might not be the best in town, but combine it with some jazz, and it's a whole new ballgame.",

Based on the ground floor, you can expect a selection of acts. Crowds have been loyally flocking to the basement club of this pizzeria since it opened in 1965. Musicians have ranged from Van Morrison to Amy Winehouse.It is great for friends gathering, as it is good price for the full program. When you pass by, ask for their brochure, which they print regularly. Musicians play 7 nights a week. This is a real insider!!!",
