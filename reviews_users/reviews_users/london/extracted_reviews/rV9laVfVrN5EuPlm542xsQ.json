We were able to get seated right away at a cozy booth on the third floor. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and when my friend requested a mocktail the bartender whipped one up right away after asking for her flavor preferences. I went with the Earthly Harmony which was nice and fresh. It was different and had a bit of a kick to it with the Chili. They also have fresh coconut water on the menu which comes in a whole coconut. At the end of our meal the waiter granted our request to open up the coconut and supplied us with 3 spoons to eat the yummy coconut left inside.",

It is quite easy to miss it. Also, in order to get to the bar itself, you would have to climb up to the 3rd floor. My excitement was building up as I climbed the stairs, but as soon as I reached the bar itself, all excitement was gone. It was nothing special, there were some old China pictures and that was about it. The cocktails have interesting names, but are quite standard.",

It's a good place for a drink if it's a night that's likely to be busy and you want to find somewhere that won't be packed out - I went on St Patrick's Day when there were queues outside every pub in soho, and it was pleasantly full, but not rammed. The drinks are tasty too! An added bonus is that the music is quiet enough that you can have a good chat without needing to shout. Just find the green front door and you're good to go!",

Finding the place is the hardest thing, as the small black door is hidden between chineese restaurants. Inside is quite similar to its neighbour ECC, but I think the bar is only on the top floor while the other floors are for the restaurant. the top floor has the resemblance of an old living room, with sofars and dark walls. typical speakeasy atmosphere. the menu is nice and the cocktails are good, although not cheap (c.\u00a315 each I think). I liked it, but I still prefer the ECC.",

We had a nice table, it was quiet enough to chat but had a buzz about it so it was still a good 'Saturday' night thing to do. Shared the veggie dim sum platter, which was delicious (but better off as a snack, not a full meal, we ended up getting a Chinese meal after!) and had a couple of cocktails.The most memorable (but maybe not the tastiest) was the Opium, served in little cauldrons that smoked. My one disappointment was that a review I had read before said the toilets were space age and shouted at you! Alas, I received no abuse when visiting the bathroom!",

Apparently it's hidden away in Chinatown and the only way to find it is to spot the black bouncer outside. But when I went here with a few girlfriends I was quickly disappointed. Not only is it pretentious, the drinks weren't amazing especially when they cost 16 pounds each. We were seated in this little corner and immediately the people sitting across from us stared us down. The waiters weren't especially friendly when we only wanted a few drinks and no food.We ordered the most famous cocktail with dry ice, which was cool when it released the fumes, but the amount of the drink was so small I finished it in 5 minutes. Overall, I think this place is all talk and there's plenty of better, friendlier cocktail bars in London.",

Properly made, properly expensive, works-of-art cocktails. Each one comes in a unique glass, is designed to make your taste buds happy and your liver unhappy, and your wallet truly miserable. I've had several of their options, including one of the virgin cocktails when I was on meds, and some of their tea. What I love is that each drink, no matter what effect it's meant to have on your body, feels picked to be part of a full offering: each tea, each cocktail, each flavor is all part of a whole experience.The decor is really nice, dark, sumptuous and, naturally, featuring a lot of red. I've sat at both the couches and the bar, and was comfortable in both. I've turned up with reservations, and without, though I imagine it could get squirrely on a busy weekend night.Tucked away among the fluorescent lights and food hanging in windows, Opium is a nice option for a date, a ladies' night, or even a nightcap of tea before making your way home.",

Because it's kind of working.We didn't have reservations, but within 5 minutes the doorman allowed us to go up 2 flights of dimly lit stairs and we were seated in equally dimly lit decor. \u00a0Our aging eyes failing us, my friend and I whipped out our cell phones in an attempt to read the menu and giving up any pretense we had that were were hip and with it. \u00a0Really helpful and extensive menu, filled with drawings of the type of glass used and exact ingredients. \u00a0Really confuses me when cocktail menus describe their drinks as essence of vanilla spice with aura of baby's breath, so I'm glad Opium got straight to the point.Drinks are pricey about 14 quid, but they are inventive. \u00a0I ordered the bubble tea drink, which was very good, and my friend ordered an electric Dragon drink which was light and fruity, and probably made out of several liquors. \u00a0Would come back here again, and pace myself on the drinks so that the bill doesn't give me a complete heart attack.",

I arrived at 9:30 PM and there was no queue outside and I had no problem joining two friends that were already inside. There were only a few other customers so we were seated immediately at a table and the staff were also prompt in taking our orders. I got a cucumber flavoured drink served in a hurricane glass the first time around, then the Yue Lao Royal the second time. I liked the first one, but the Yue Lao Royal was not at all like I expected... it tasted like a port wine, drinkable but not altogether like a cocktail. I ordered another one of the cucumber cocktails, and my last drink was an old-fashioned, not on the menu but always a solid choice at a good cocktail bar. We also ordered some char siu bau, which is a neat feature of this Chinatown speakeasy. I wouldn't come here specifically for the food, but it hits the spot after a few cocktails and you don't want to leave the bar just yet. We had two friends join us later in the night and the bar was very accommodating in letting them in and pulling up extra chairs. They also had great music, with a mix of chill tunes that you wouldn't necessarily dance to but are perfect for a cocktail setting. I had a great time and I am sure that I will visit this place again.",

The drink was good with a good balance of vodka and cranberry juice and served in a tall glass. The dim sum was a bit soggy but I won't hold it against them because I arrived late and it had probably been on the table for a while. It was a really fun night and a great option in the neighborhood. Similar to ECC a few doors down but I think I liked the ambience here better.

After taking days to get back to me, they only reimbursed for one charge and not the other - and proceeded to ignore my follow up calls and emails.

There are also two other sections, but I think they're either private dining or open only on weekends. The bar includes 2 menus - the traditional drink/dim sum menu and the zodiac menu (!!!). I ordered the raffle shrub sling (because who doesn't love a good shrub cocktail?) and my friend ordered some sort of whiskey cocktail. You can order shared cocktails, as well as sing shots, wines, beers, etc. The zodiac menu was the biggest attraction for me, as you can order a drink based on your Chinese zodiac. I ordered the cat one because it was a little tart (don't tell anyone - my zodiac's a dog ;)). We ordered the dim sum platter after cocktails. It had various types of dumplings, but my favorite were the vegetable dumplings. The dim sum was a little boring however, and I would have liked to see some more creativity. Then again, you don't really go to Opium for the food. All in all, lovely experience for drinks and company.",

There are many potions to choose from with a standard drink menu and specialty one to represent each year of the Chinese zodiac.You will receive your drink in a cup representing your year and each is designed to highlight a different element and tincture.I enjoyed the Umami martini, with a hint of spice, well balanced and interestingly topped with truffle oil. It was a fun atmosphere.Upstairs on the third level is a darker bar. Come here for no frills but stiff drinks. This is a quieter escape when it fills up below. Either way, this is a Chinatown gem.",

    "text": "We reserved a table for 5 with my friends.I love the special bars you can find in London and Opium was on my list for a while.We arrived a little before 9PM (time of the booking) and they let us entered on time. We were first seated in the Apothicary room (the time they clean our reserved table) before going upstairs in the Attic.The atmosphere in both rooms is slightly different: the Apothicary room looks more like a small dim sum restaurant, cosy and pretty dark; the Attic room has several couches and feels very cosy as well. We ordered different cocktails, I chose the \"Goat\" one from the Zodiac menu. The design of the cocktail glass (As a goat) and the drink itself were great. The mix of vodka and lemon and cucumber made it really interesting and good.Some of my friends ordered some dumplings and they enjoyed them (even if it was a bit pricy compared to other places around Chinatown...)Also, they offered us some gin/mango shots, Delicious !It's a nice place to go to have a good cocktail in an unique atmosphere however, if you are looking for a place to drink a lot... may be not the best, except if you have money to spend",

    "text": "The drinks were nicely themed but didn't use the right asian flavors; basically a normal drink in an asian container. Also, a speakeasy is suppose to be dark? There's one open window around 6pm that takes away from the atmosphere. In general, the bartenders didn't have the soft touch sophisticated service that I was expecting. It really felt they were selling street food.Here's the justification: I was sitting close to the bartenders. They were throwing used utensils into the sink and missed...quite a few times. The first time they spilled syrup on my raw jeans (now i might have to throw them away because its is sticky and I can't wear these...that's $100 down the drain). They didn't actually notice and I had to tell them. After that... they were still having a great time! This time throwing ice water around and again missed. I guess if they can't make it as bartenders.. maybe they could be basketball stars? oh wait...",

I expected an oriental fusion with sexy dark tones of chocolate and cigars! Too much? Well that's what I wanted but what I got was just a dark basic looking bar. (we were on the second floor so I can't speak for the other floors)The cocktail menu was vast but I went for the one everyone mentions when they come here! Opium #6 !!! It didn't disappoint!! The theatrics of the dry ice,the smell and even the taste was worth the wait! Sadly my girl had a very basic bland tasting one so I can't speak for the quality of all their drinks but if you come get what I did! It won't disappoint! Drinks start from \u00a311 & up! :)",

But compared to other speakeasy bars it's only about average. Drinks are delicious but they lack the wow factor. Same with the service. Lovely, but lacking the one to one personalised service usual of speakeasy bars. At \u00a314 a drink you kind of expect more.",

Fun atmosphere, going for the opium den feel of yesteryear. Definitely recommend the opium drink if you want something light and a bit sweet. So fun to watch them pour in the tea with the dried ice to give off the smoke! \u00a0Was not expecting this so it was a fun treat. Their drinks in general are sweet and a bit light, but still yummy, just don't come here expecting to get hammered. We stayed til closing as I tried to finish my gin martini ( not a specialty here so do not recommend it). Bartender were friendly, music was good. A bit sparse on a Friday night but if you just want to chill and relax, this is the place.",

Thank god, because it was really cold outside!Only the 1st level was open due to it being a Wednesday. We were seated in the peony bar, which is really cool in terms of the decor. Although we were seated in this bar, we ordered drinks from the opium bar menu; devil doctor \u00a313 and the lychee martini \u00a35 (with LCW wristband).

    "text": "This place is difficult- I liked some of their dim sum, but thought it was massively overpriced, and also liked their cocktails- but have had far better for lower prices elsewhere. The main negative point for me was that the drinks were just not amazing. A bit too sweet, a bit too expensive, a bit too...normal. They need a better mixologist, because the bar itself makes it seem like they're about to serve you a glass of heaven.Things that were great? It's rare to find truffle dim sum in London. I thought the mushroom and truffle dim sum was actually done very well- but would worry about returning as it seems to have some fairly mixed reviews. Goodness knows I wouldn't want to pay that much if I ordered it and it was chewy or under-filled. Our other food items were also quite tasty. I also liked the decor, ambience, and exclusivity- hidden doors are always charming! However, Nightjar has a similar vibe without being ridiculously overpriced and has much more consistency. I want to give three stars, I really do, but it will be a while before I decide to give this place another chance.",

He recognised our reservation and asked us to go up to the third floor. Presented with a dark, incense filled stair case, I was slightly concerned at what I'd got me and my friend in to.. but as we arrived on the 3rd floor we were pleasantly surprised!Quirky furniture, cool music and a great atmosphere. We sat in a couple of arm chairs, ordered the dim sum platter and a cocktail each. The service on the cocktails was very slow and top end budget, the cheapest being \u00a311! But once the dim sum arrived all was forgiven. The platter (\u00a316) consisted of 2 buns and 8 steamed dim sum. It was so delicious we ordered 1 more basket (\u00a37) of the har gau.I would definitely go back for the food, but perhaps have a few 2 for 1 cocktails at Be at One first!",
