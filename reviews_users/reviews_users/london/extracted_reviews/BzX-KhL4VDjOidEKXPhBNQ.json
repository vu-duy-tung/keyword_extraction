I had doubts when ordering it on the basis that it might be a bit boring, but it was excellent, really tasty, there wasn't any fancy sauce but it didn't need it as the various component parts had been cooked so well. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meals, particularly the three people who had lobster linguine. The staff were really friendly as helpful as well. In terms of negative points, it was interesting reading Wolfie's post below as the music was too loud and was an odd sort of jazzy lift music which got irritating at times. But as soon as the conversation was flowing properly you couldn't really hear it anymore, so its only a minor criticism",

    "text": "\"There is no charge for awesomeness...or attractiveness.\" \u00a0-- Kung Fu PandaWise words indeed Mr Panda, but unfortunately neither applies to Zafferano. \u00a0I went to this place a few months ago to simultaneously celebrate:1.) My arrival in London2.) A large cash infusion into my bank account (a necessary prerequisite for any trip to Zafferano).3.) The fact I had a date. \u00a0This only occurs when Jupiter and Saturn are in alignment and Venus is in ascension, so it needed to be celebrated properly.This restaurant is awesomeness on a plate, but despite the maxim above, there is a price. \u00a0I got out of here for about \u00a3200 between 2 people, but it was worth every penny. \u00a0In particular, the tiramisu was unbelievable. \u00a0I've never quite experienced anything like it. \u00a0Unfortunately my date didn't order the tiramisu and so I had to give half of it to her...woe is me.The vibe was definitely that everyone in there had way more money than me. \u00a0There was a particularly amusing couple next to us who looked like they came out of Home and Gardens or an advertisement for Patek Phillippe watches (come to think of it I think the guy was wearing one of these). \u00a0They spent the entire evening drinking their expensive decanted wine and eating their expensive truffle-laden meal, while managing to completely avoid eye contact with each other or even say a word. \u00a0That's the kind of marriage I want to have one day.Thanks to the credit crunch I had no trouble reserving a table a few days in advance, for a Saturday night at 7:30. \u00a0Apparently this used to be quite a feat so take advantage of the slowdown while you can!",

    "text": "I have been visiting Zafferano on pretty much a monthly basis since it opened. Giorgio Locatelli cooked here before branching out on his own, and head chef Andrew Needham has been a safe pair pf hands in the kitchen for years. Zafferano has long been established as one of the top handful of Italian restaurants in London, one of just four with a Michelin star. In my experience the best dishes are the salads and the pasta. Most UK restaurants take little care with sourcing their ingredients, but here many of the salad ingredients are imported directly from the markets of Italy, and it really shows in the taste that arrive on the plate. Pasta is very carefully made, and risotto is properly cooked from scratch, taking 20 minutes. The menu changes seasonally, and there is hardly ever a slip in either main courses or desserts. Service under maitre d' Enzo Cassini is carefully drilled and manages to be both efficient and genuinely friendly. The price of success is that prices have risen inexorably, with the wine list in particular having quite high mark-ups.",

The food on both occasions was excellent and wine recommendation was reasonably priced and perfectly complimented the food. Prices are very reasonable for 2 courses and the more exotic dishes do come with a supplement, but well worth the extra. Can highly recommend the octopus, baratta, lobster pasta and fresh pasta with morels. Lovely place.",

The point is, cheap and simple Italian food is so good, so understanding of flavour and balance that it almost seems unnecessary to have to shell out for really expensive stuff. Having said that, places like Zafferano's and these sorts of upmarket Italian joints are pretty exceptional. This is a Michelin star restaurant that uses the best of the best ingredients to build on traditional and honest Italian classics to create something a bit more modern and inventive. They do some set price lunch menus which make the meal a whole lot more reasonable although with anywhere like this, watch the wine. It's brilliant and the list is extensive, but it's expensive and is like letting a rabbit burrow in your wallet for a full calendar month.",

Beautiful decor, abounding with fresh lilies (I remember this because a) I love lilies and b) she is allergice so we sat in numerous spots until we found the optimal lily-free zone). We started with a beautiful bottle of white and delicious salads, followed by two equally exquisite pasta dishes. Impeccable service throughout in a very calming and intimate setting. A great Sunday evening destination. Only complaint...the tiramisu. A goopy, confusing consistency we could not figure out, and not of the standard one would expect from a Michelin-starred establishment. So give that a miss, but definitely pay Zefferano a visit.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 Entering Zafferano feels like stepping into the dining hall of an up-market old people's home. Not only are the majority of customers far past retirement age but also the atmosphere is pleasantly subdued and old-fashioned with white table clothes and humongous flower arrangements. In short,you wouldn't go to Zafferano for people watching or to meet men. Unless you want to catch a millionaire in his eighties of courseZafferano is not only in one the poshest parts of town,namely in the border between Knightsbridge and Belgravia,but it is also just next to a Louboutin shoe shop. Just the right think to wet your appetite,girls Because let me tell you,food was,if not very experimental,solidly outstanding. Already the bread was superb all for different varieties and the grissini were so tasty that we had to hold back not to finish the entire bread basket. The menu costs 34.50 for 2 courses,44.50 for three and 49.50 for four courses. As a starter we tried the Burata which came with rucola,cherry tomatoes and aubergine. The cheese was heavenly creamy and ripe and tasted ever so slightly salty. It was beautiful by itself,but even better with the aromatic tomatoes. Forget about the aubergine though,this was undercooked and without any merit. The Branzino Carpaccio was again lovely the fish fresh and melting in my mouth and the pieces of sweet water melon providing an interesting contrast. However,the rucola was too strong a taste and was overpowering the fish. Maybe one should send a notification out to all Italian restaurant in London that we still like them,even if they don't put rucola into absolutely everything Faultless were the 2 main courses. I was hesitant at first to order the monk fish as I had too many dried out monk fish pieces recently. The Zafferano version however was divine:succulent and cooked to perfection,the monk fish came in a light,Asian-inspired sauce with crunchy pieces of lightly grilled zucchini. I am usually not the biggest veal fan,but I was glad that I gave it a try at Zafferano's. The meat was pink and soft and was immersed in the most beautiful and light gravy with good helping of very flavoursome chanterelles. No,the food is not experimental and it doesn't push any boundaries,but gosh! it's so comforting once in a while,instead of chasing after unusual flavour combinations,rare and exotic herbs and weird ways of preparing things,to just lean back and savour exceptionally well prepared familiar flavours. And,judging by the number of centenarians at Zafferano,it also seems their food makes you live long! The service was very annoying though. I mean hugely annoying. I have never seen a restaurant where your full (FULL!!) wine glasses get topped up every 20 seconds. It was impossible to have a conversation because you always had to get rid off terribly keen waiters that were humming around you like flies. When we told them that they please should stop doing this,they were miffed and didn't fill our wine glasses at all anymore,not even when they were empty. (Dear Zafferano team,this is the point when you actually SHOULD fill up a wine glass. Easy:empty = fill!).",

The Private dining area is downstairs in the cellar & the big oak table seating at least 16 people the low lighting adds to the rustic feel of the room. I believe that during the week this room hosts sophisticated dinner parties. Starters were platters of decadent cured meats, buffalo mozzerella with cherry tomatoes, seared tuna, selection of medittaranean vegetables with cuttlefish amongst the dishes. I do not eat seafood or fish as a rule but was tempted to try the tuna and it was wonderful so perhaps I am cured of my fear of fish. Next we enjoyed 2 types of pasta, a ravioli and a rissotto both equally good. Main course I had to select the veal which was cooked to medium perfection. Dessert had to be the classic Tiramisu which was different to how I have had it before but surely this is how Tiramisu should taste absolutely heavenly. The staff are attentive, the wine list extensive and all in all I feel we had an excellent night which was also good value.",

ORDER: Rocket and parmesan salad (ask for cherry tomatoes with it); saffron risotto (their classic dish); Veal Milanese; Tortino al cioccolato con gelato alla vaniglia; Sfera al cioccolato bianco con gelato alla fragolaAVOID: eating too much bread before dinner ;) undercooked risotto; arriving without a reservation I generally order the same items every time I come here because I love it! I order the rocket and parmesan with cherry tomatoes for an appetizer. Make sure to ask for their balsamic vinegar with the salad - its amazing! For an entree, you must get the saffron risotto! They aren't skimpy with the saffron, so it does have amazing flavor, BUT the past three times I went here, their risotto was VERY undercooked. Being a risotto lover, I order it somewhere probably once every other week, so I know a good risotto - when they cooked it for another two minutes, it was perfect! There needs to be a nice shaving of parmesan cheese on the risotto. The \u00a0tortino al cioccolato con gelato alla vaniglia is amazing, but it takes about 12 minutes to come out - so either order it ahead of time or be ok with waiting (ITS WORTH IT).I will say that recently I haven't been hungry at dinner and neither has my family, so we tended to order less than we normally do and didn't order wine - to be honest, I felt when we ordered less (and therefore spent less), they tended to be a bit more cool to us and were not nearly as attentive. But nonetheless, I still love this restaurant and their food, hopefully next time I go they will cook the risotto a bit more.Will definitely go again.",

The risotto is a large serving and can be split if followed by a meat dish. We were at the restaurant during a heat wave in Europe and the air conditioning was lacking. No ice is added to the drinks unless one requests it.",

The outer room we were seated in was about half full for our Sunday night 9:30 reservation.As we had just come from high tea about two hours earlier, we really did not have much of an appetite and decided to go with the prix fixe two-course meal (as opposed to three or four courses). You're allowed to pick two from any of the four categories (starter, pasta, main, dessert). I had the winter salad starter and chanterelle mushroom pasta. Both were really good, and I thought they were rather nonconventional. Dining partner had the ravioli pasta and the veal main, which he said was quite good as well. Honestly had no room for dessert...lame, I know.A solid choice for a good meal.",

    "text": "Zafferano truly deserves its Michelin star. The food is fantastic and the service is attentive. The ambiance in the restaurant is not too snobbish or uptight, and the prices, while high, are not ridiculous. Two courses for \u00a336.50, three courses for \u00a346.50 and four courses for \u00a351.50. It is truly worth the price.We opted for two courses each. For starters, my dining partner ordered the winter salad, which she said was delicious, and just right. I didn't order a starter, however was brought a plate with focaccia, salami and some parmesan, to munch on. As a main course, I got the pappardelle with braised beef cheeks, while she got the veal cutlet with potato puree and artichokes.I've never tried pasta with beef cheeks before and was nervous that I wouldn't like it. However it was truly delicious, the beef was tender and perfectly complimented the al dente pasta. The sauce was delicious, and I was told by the waiters, takes 3 days to make. The veal was incredibly good and tender, the kind that melts in your mouth. The potato puree was delicious too. For dessert I got apple pie with vanilla ice cream- again, a truly perfect dish.I'm sure that every dish on the menu is truly exceptional, and portions aren't too big (but not tiny either, as is so common in expensive restaurants), meaning that you could comfortably have three or four courses.I strongly recommend this restaurant.",
