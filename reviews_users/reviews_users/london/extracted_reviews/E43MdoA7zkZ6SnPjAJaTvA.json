The decor is timeless, the staff highly professional, and the food ...simply superb, especially for the price. Saunter in and feel you've been sucked back into the late 1930s. The amber lighting is warm and enticing....and looks particularly good on any complexion. \u00a0The waitstaff are immaculately dressed, and their manners...impeccable. \u00a0(cue: wow what good service) . Decor: Have a look at the photos posted, they speak for themselves. The menu is what you would expect from a brasserie, but a few notches higher on the quality scale. \u00a0I've had a few fish dishes here and my companion had the steak several times, all of which have been perfectly cooked, seasoned, and served in a generous portion every time. \u00a0From what people tell me ordering steak in London can be a bit hit or miss, but not here.Highly recommended. And visit the neighboring Bar Americain. It's a dream.",

    "text": "Top marks. Brasserie Zedel delivered a fantastic dining experience. The grand dining room was buzzing when we arrived at 9pm. We were promptly seated and offered water. We dined from the menu Formula which is good value for such a central location. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful with our wine choices - even allowing me to try 2 wines before settling on the Pinot Noir (highly recommend!) Starter of an unfamiliar celeriac dish was nice enough however the mains of beef bourguignon with creamy mash and grilled mackerel were both delicious. Well cooked and balanced dishes. The meat was so tender! To finish we had floating islands which were beautifully presented and (though I couldn't finish mine) a lovely end to the meal. Our water and wine was topped up unobtrusively and the was no pushy table turning even though they were extremely busy. Thanks Zedal - fabulous night!",

    "text": "I made a call reservation earlier but when i arrived they claimed i didn't even call! It was quite frustrating cause we then had to queue up at the bar next to the brasserie to wait for a table. We ordered a beer and a glass of Chardonnay with chips during our wait. The attitude of a particular waitress at the bar was not very nice, but the rest of the service was friendly and welcoming. The interior was indeed impressive (as described in all the other comments here) with all the art deco fit out with a mix and match of american-french visuals.. The thick chips that came along with the drinks were perfectly fried, but the presentation of them snuggling in a little cup was not as appealing as i would prefer. For dinner we ordered a Formule menu with celeriac as appetizer, beef in red wine as a main, and a floating island for dessert, accompanied with a glass of red. We also ordered the escargot and Choucroute Alsacienne, which is a nice mix of pork belly, sausage on a bed of pickled cabbage. Dinner overall was okay, the beef was a little dry and the pork wasn't remarkably good, but if you are just looking for a cosy standard-level dinner with unique interior then this is the place for you. On the side note it was really loud, by the end of the dinner my throat was sore from shouting across the table to my partner sitting just opposite me.",

    "text": "After seeing some of the cute branded enamel plates pop up on Instagram (clever marketing ploy, guys), I decided to try out Brasserie Z\u00e9del for my birthday dinner. A group of 6 of us met up in the Bar Americain and were treated to some well-mixed cocktails with polite and efficient table service in a kitschy but affectionately intimate approximation of a 30s Parisian Bar.From there we were whisked to our table in the restaurant itself - an over-the-top marbled deco paean to the Grand Brasseries of Montparnasse. In some ways it's too big - I later found out that my brother and his wife had been dining there at exactly the same time and we neither knew nor saw each other! Service was good, not too intrusive despite the fact that some of our party arrived at different times. The wine is great value but the food was a mixed affair: a dainty starter of frogs legs was tasty but trop petit. My choucroute lacked a bit of punch somehow; a friend complained his lamb was dry, but others seemed happy with their choices. Unfortunately there was no time to sample desserts as we had a booking at Le Crazy Coqs, the cabaret bar that makes up the rest of this venue.And THAT was fantastic, with great service, delicious signature cocktails and a charming performer. As an all-round experience it was a great night out... and for a moment I felt transported to another time and place. But the food (while great value) is a little hit and miss.",

Once you walk through the little cafe area at the front of the establishment, you find yourself descending a huge staircase into what can only be described as the lobby of a 1920's hotel or cinema (or both). It's a bit surreal.We went to the Bar Americain to have a few drinks. This was after the nine boozes I had at lunch and before the many more boozes I was going to have at Clockjack Oven. The seating area in the bar also has a very 1920's feel to it. There's a grandiose bar along one wall and the bartender and server were dressed to go with the decor.Of course, they serve old fashioneds which two of my drinking companions ordered, but I opted for some other drinks from the menu, both of which were fantastic.What a cool place to come for cocktails in the afternoon.

I came here with a few friends for a pre-theatre meal a few nights ago.We were led into a large room with tall ceilings and nice lighting. It felt very much like a French brasserie on a much larger scale. The menu was extensive with something for everyone. I opted for the onion soup and smoked mackerel while my friends had the steak-frites, sea bream, and seabass. We will split two very nice bottles of red. We had some coffee and creme brulee for dessert. The meal was solid. Very tasty and everyone was satisfied. The prices were extremely reasonable given the quality of the food and how nice the ambiance was. I completely regret not finding this place sooner as I would love to be a regular. The service was excellent. We told them of our hard stop to head to the theater and they did everything they could to help us get on our way in time. I would absolutely recommend this place for a pre-theatre meal or dinner generally. I could also see this being a great choice for brunch or lunch.",

Has become a good standby and their prix-fix are great deals and while it's busy, the space is large enough to get seating (although maybe I'm just really lucky now that I'm reading other people saying reservations are must).

Finally, the ambience was top notch. \u00a0Once we climbed down the stairs, we found a spacious, glamorous space before us, making it hard to believe we were even in London anymore. \u00a0There seemed to be a performance going on at the same time in the adjacent room as well. \u00a0It'd be great if I could combine food with a performance next time I'm here.Overall, a great experience and highly recommended when you find yourself in the happening Piccadilly Circus.",

The food is fabulous, the prices are even easier to digest, they have live jazz, I just love it. \u00a0I really could wax lyrical about it for ages but I won't so you will need to go there for yourselves to check it out.",

Included in that are 3 courses, a glass of red or white wine and a coffee to finish. For value for money it probably can't be beaten in the area. \u00a0The actual meal itself was mainly a hit. The starter of C\u00e9leri R\u00e9moulade felt like more of a side and is not something I'll be rushing to try again however it's not the worst thing I've ever had but the B\u0153uf Bourguignon was fantastic. Big chunks of beef just falling apart and tasty creamy mash. This was definitely the highlight. The dessert of Ile Flottante was also tasty and was just enough to finish the meal off. \u00a0While the meal is ok Brasserie Z\u00e9del is more about the experience. The dining room is fantastic and has to be seen to be believed and the staff were all very helpful and extremely knowledgeable about both the food and the wine. This is a place you need to visit",

I had the duck (Magret de Canard R\u00f4ti) which was cooked to perfection; however, as I have a big appetite and the portion wasn't as filling as I would have liked. For being such a lush and popular venue the prices are very reasonable in any case. Although it is located in the tourist hotspot of Piccadily it doesn't feel touristy at all, and as it's a classy place and isn't over-priced I've been there before with my parents and friends before, and will definitely go back again. I would give it 5 stars if the portions were bigger, and I also had a very slow waiter this time which was annoying when wanting to order another drink and ask for another side.",

We just had a simple salad, some sides and the fish.

    "text": "Maybe the romanticism of being on a first date (with my now husband) wore off because I was even less impressed with Zedel nearly 4 years later. Don't get me wrong, this is a really interesting find in Piccadilly Circus and the architecture is still impressive and the atmosphere is still outstanding, but the food and service just don't hit the mark in the slightest.My little sister and her boyfriend were visiting from NY and so we decided to take them here since it's in a touristy area, but kind of hidden (in terms of 'you wouldn't expect something like this to exist here') and also has a nice vibe. We arrived at 930pm on a Wednesday for our reservation and the placed was packed, so we needed to wait for our table. When we were finally seated we were smashed into a tiny booth right by the bar. Which was kind of annoying given there were open tables in other areas and also, my husband is 6'4\" 240lbs and my sister's boyfriend isn't far off from that. But it was fine, I am used to being elbowed by my leftie husband every time he cuts his food and shovels it into his mouth anyway (hehe). The next thing that was annoying was that we were given menus in French, which was clearly on purpose given that fact that we spoke ENGLISH whilst ordering our bottle of wine and other drinks at the bar. Blah blah blah, we order food and it comes. I specifically asked the waiter if the lobster cocktail had mayo in it like a typical disgusting British prawn cocktail and he said no... well when it came, it did. I was a little annoyed but didn't say anything because I didn't want to sour the mood. Second course comes and my husband goes to eat his steak and as he is taking his second bite he gets a taste of truffle, which he HATES with a passion. I don't understand how anyone can hate truffles, but he does and refuses to eat anything with truffles involved. He requested the menu and it did not say ANYWHERE on the menu that the butter on the steak is in fact truffle butter (but I guess we could be thankful it wasn't the Nicki Minaj kind). While this may be a pleasant surprise for most, it was not for him. Thankfully they offered to take the steak off the bill and he had an excuse to go eat a Big Mac. I had the scallops and they were pretty unimpressive. I only ate half of my main, which is not like me since I am a giant food beast.The only redeeming quality of the evening is that there was a live jazz band playing - though we were seated too far away from them to really hear them or enjoy it. I could overhear the first date that was happening on the bar stools two feet from us more clearly.Come here if your idea of good food is going to a Harvester.",

Their decor and vibe are a solid four stars as it feels as you have been whisked to a Paris brasserie as there was a guy playing the 88 keys. Perhaps I am spoiled having spent time in Paris and live in the SF Bay Area but their food was not memorable. Very basic barely passable French. Their service also seemed a bit disjointed as I quite frankly didn't know who our server was. I can't say I'll be back. At least \"we'll always have Paris\".",

    "text": "Before I write this review, I hasten to add that I suspect on a good day, this is a place well and truly worthy of an extra star. I think I was probably unlucky in the time and day I went...!Anyway, a group of myself and nine friends had ordered a table to eat here last Tuesday evening. It's easy to get to, the setting is absolutely gorgeous, and our orders were taken quickly and efficiently. The service for the starters was very quick indeed, probably given that the starters were mostly raw: we pretty much all picked set menus, and the Prix Fixe and Formule menus give you carottes r\u00e2p\u00e9es and c\u00e9leri r\u00e9moulade respectively as a starter!For the main, however, the service was disappointingly slow. It must have taken nearly an hour after we had finished our starter to bring our main (which given pretty much the entire table was eating rare steak hach\u00e9, or the beef bourguignon which was probably cooked in bulk, is a little surprising!). The food for both courses was good, well-cooked (or rather, perfect all the more because it wasn't cooked too much, as it's supposed to be!) and reasonable French food. It was nothing that would blow your mind, but it was tasty and well-prepared.The other blow to the service came after pudding - one member of our table had been waiting half an hour for a glass of wine they'd ordered, and four of the coffees supposed to come with the Formule menu didn't arrive... I will give the place the benefit of the doubt and assume this was not an intentional attempt to see if slightly more merry customers (luckily I wasn't drinking that evening!) would forgo their coffee, but it does make one wonder... Anyway, the waitress wasn't particularly helpful or polite when dealing with the request RE: the wine, trying to insist that we'd had the glass and pointing at the glasses of other members of the table, who had been drinking their wine far before my friend had ordered his (never received) glass... She was rather shirty considering we were the one who'd been slighted, and by this point the restaurant was almost empty, so she didn't even have the excuse of juggling several tables at once.Overall, the place has good, well-prepared standard French food, and the setting is beautiful, but the service is a little hit-and-miss. If you've a spare hour, don't go in case you don't finish in time; if you've a spare two/three, you'll probably have a wonderful evening!",

You enter at a below ground level lobby that takes you to the roaring 20's and everything Art Deco you could imagine. There is a coat check, a dark and sculptured bar/lounge and an amazing nude marble grand room. It used to be a substantial hotel, and the dining room does not disappoint. It is is large and beautiful, yet you are still able to have an intimidate meal.The menu is everything delicious and diving straight from a Parisian menu. There were so many options that I wanted to sample, we ended up over ordering for the table. We sampled the French onion soup, potato leak soup, carrot salad, celery salad, potato and leak tart, poivre steak, pommes frites with Bernaise sauce, seafood in puff pastry and house fish. The offer great prix fixed menus ranging from ten to twenty pounds. Quite a bargain for three courses some including a glass of house wine.For dessert we had truffles, profiteroles, coffee and cake and our favorite the floating island dessert.We had a few kinks in our service, but the manager more then made up for it. So in our books it was a five star meal.I cannot wait to go back to London to visit Brasserie Zedel again. Thank goodness I don't live closer, because I don't think that my waistline could handle it.",

    "text": "Brasserie Z\u00e9del is my favourite restaurant in central London, if not all of London. You can eat cheaply or blow the budget; the menu has plenty of options. Tables are held back specifically for walk-ins so you can generally get a table easily apart from special occasions or just after a national paper publishes another good review.Out of the starters, I recommend the soup (currently leek and potato but changes regularly) and the chicken liver parfait (a firm menu staple).Mains-wise, the fish fillet (there's always sea bream and/or sea bass on the menu), duck (accompaniments change but generally always on the menu) and choucroute (firm staple) are always lovely. For those who don't really like French food (really?), there's the steak hach\u00e9 (like a skinny burger with fries) or goujonettes (fish bites with fries).All the deserts are epic - ask your server for a recommendation. If you are feeling full, you just have a solitary scoop of ice cream or sorbet (they will charge you less). Try to save room for a \"real\" dessert though.If you're in a rush, let someone know and they will turn your table pretty quickly. Some sections are looked after better than others and I recommend ordering drinks immediately as sometimes they can take a while to turn up and you don't want your starters to arrive before your drinks do. Regarding water, the servers are quite happy to bring you tap water and will discreetly replace an empty carafe with a full one whilst you're tucking into your food.In the evenings there is live piano music, but if you're into performing arts, there's usually a show on at The Crazy Coqs at 8pm or so. It's the venue up the stairs and is the most Art Deco looking part of what is truly a gorgeous building. Z\u00e9del is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.The Bar Am\u00e9ricain is a great place to wait for a table (the staff will let you know when one is ready) and they do great cocktails, including off-menu ones. Just be aware that it's very expensive. You can eat at the Brasserie on a budget, but the Bar is never cheap (unless you're on bottled water, which is only a quid).ZL Caf\u00e9 upstairs is fab for having a coffee or quick lunch/snack, but it closes quite early. Many people mistake it for the Brasserie - the Brasserie is downstairs. There's a lift if you need one and a free baggage check (tips welcome).I'm always treated well at Z\u00e9del. Great food and service.",

Even though the small, cute, French-looking cafe your walk into is nice, it doesn't prepare you for the beautiful, decadent, art-deco style interior as you walk downstairs. My next big surprise came when I saw the prices... considering it's central London, the prices are incredibly cheap with a set menu starting at around \u00a313.

They've kept the theming going throughout with the beautiful antique posters on the wall as you venture downstairs and the dining hall is so grand with tall pillars and decadence of gold and burgundy. It had a similar air to the dining hall in The Shining (I see this as a good thing). The food itself was nice, nothing too spectacular but very pleasant. I know they also have a separate bar and run other events also which would be good to check out",

I have to be honest, the food is not outstanding - hence the four star review - but there's a variety on offer and it's all good value. I'd recommend the prix fixe menus but personally grated carrots just doesn't do me as a starter. What I absolutely adore here is the ambiance and the decoration. It was refurbished in the original Art Deco style a few years ago and walking down the stairs to the main foyer never fails to impress friends. It's stunning. What's more, there's often live music playing in the main restaurant and the excellent service coupled with the surroundings essentially makes you feel like you've gone back to another age. After eating in the evening you can also visit their (more expensive) cocktail bar and jazz bar. It's pretty much like this place was invented for me, to be honest.",

The first was light and tasty, with just enough Dijon mustard. The quiche was DELICIOUS. Soft and so buttery. For less than 10 quid for my meal, I was pleasantly happy. The service was also very good: far better than your typical London establishment. The crowd seemed to be a mix of tourists and Londoners.",

Food came in small portions, but was delicious! I recommend getting the peach sorbet with champ ang for dessert - they pour the champagne for you and get in when the champagne is still filming and you'll get a great shot to show off to friends.

I ordered the French onion soup and Quiche Lorraine (under \u00a36 each) while my husband went with the three-course Prix Fixe, which currently includes a carrot salad appetizer, beef patty covered in sauce and fries main, and a slice of dessert (similar to tiramisu) for under \u00a313. I was expecting more cheese to cover the soup (there was a very small amount) and the quiche to be thicker (it was pretty thin), but otherwise, I enjoyed the taste of both (and actually, I understand the smaller portion sizes because they were under the appetizer section rather than the mains, and this appears to be a nicer place). The crust on the quiche was the highlight of my meal. The French menu is their standard menu and does include descriptions underneath the names of some dishes in small print in English, but they also have an English menu, so ask for it if you don't speak French and would like to know what everything actually is. Overall, I thought the ambiance was nice, but not my personal taste, and the food was okay. The service was quite good.Note: You need to take the elevator down to get to this formal dining room.",

Trying to even get into the bar area at around 730pm is next to impossible with wait times of over 20 minutes. At \u00a312 for a cocktail it might be worth meeting elsewhere for a pre dinner drink. The service in the restaurant itself is good but it seems to me that the food prices are rising and no longer represent exceptional value for money. Saying that I would recommend the trout with almonds as a main.",

    "text": "I have no clue why I never knew about Zedels, it's right in the heart of London and I've walked past so many times without stopping or giving it a second look. From the outside it looks like a caf\u00e9, very much 'caf\u00e9 rouge' in style. You can buy juices, coffees and teas, sandwiches cakes and pastries. However downstairs they have the restaurant and Bar Americana. So we opted to go to the restaurant after I looked at some of the yelp reviews, and it was worth the visit! I can honestly say I never knew such a fantastic place existed in London. The restaurant greets you with white marble, dark wood and exudes an air of French chic. This is by far one of the best dining experiences I've had in a \u00a0while. I opted for the Prix Fixe 2 courses. It came with: Grated carrot starter - absolutely amazing with fresh herbs and a \u00a0divine vinaigrette sauce. Fresh tasty bread and butter. Steak main with pepper sauce and a side of fries. I asked for blue and it came as expected blue, but not as expected, minced steak in a patty. However it was absolutely wonderful. Tasty, fresh and the fries, thin cut and crispy, went extremely well with the peppercorn sauce. Delightful. All this washed down with a nice Boudreaux. Not only was the food amazing, felt authentically French, the quality was great, but this is the best service I have had in a very long time. The waiter constantly refilled our water and wine glasses, was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and overall rounded this great experience. The price for the Prix Fixe was a bargain \u00a39.75. The wine was a little more expensive at \u00a325 for a couple of glasses each, but was worth every penny. This is my new favourite London restaurant.",

I was given a menu and water quickly. I ordered the onion soup and the frisee salad. Yummy crusty bread and a small pot of butter arrived. While waiting for my food, the host tried to seat another person right next to me despite the mostly empty room. (That diner insisted on another table.) My soup came piping hot. It was good, though VERY salty. The salad arrived after I finished my soup. It was nicely presented and had a good flavor. That would have been the perfect meal but I was tempted by the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was also delicious but made me too full!! Service was lacking. I was ignored through most of my meal. Beautiful dining room AND bathrooms. A bit high for lunch, I paid \u00a319.55, no alcohol.",

The food, unfortunately, didn't.I stopped by to sample their prix fixe menu, but I didn't realize that the price wasn't the only thing fixed about the menu. There are no appetizer, entr\u00e9e, or dessert options. You can only chose to have two courses and three courses and since I don't eat meat, this was out of the question. Instead, I went for the special of the day for \u00a315.75 (Thursday's lunch is the chicken braised with tomatoes, mushrooms, shallots, and tarragon) and a starter of six escargot for \u00a39.75.The complimentary bread we received was rockhard, which was a huge disappointment since one of the main things I remember about my Parisian vacations is the delicious bread. Perhaps this foreshadowed the rest of the meal: the escargot was way too salty to appreciate any of the intricacies of the flavor. Same goes for the chicken. Our server was also extremely brusque and probably said about two words to us (after taking our order).Still, while this sounds a bit superficial, I think I might come back simply for the wow factor of the dining room in the basement if I'm ever in London again. Though I might opt for coffee and dessert instead of an entire meal...",

    "text": "I'm a little torn with my experience here as initially I was wowed entering the grand dining room with high ceilings and extravagant decor. However the service and some dishes were lacking that extra special touch to make me readily return.Having eaten in France and other European countries I can say that quality was lacking in all the traditional dishes. The escargot was my favourite dish being full of flavour and tasty sauce to dip my bread in. The other starters I tried were the steak tartare, plain and not super fresh, along with the egg over asparagus, which was good.For main, I ordered the steak a la Bordelaise which I was quite disappointed being the most expensive selection. It came as I ordered it, medium, however it was very chewy. Also the sauce was quite plain, tasting no bone marrow and just some onion with red wine. The mashed potatoes were also plain, could have used more French butter. The green salad is simply a bunch of lettuce with a light dressing. They could have added more to make it special.Overall I felt like food quality reflected the prices. It is low for a reason. Service was intermittent. We had a large group so I understand but our server spilled a little wine when pouring into several glasses. These little touches reflect back into the review.One nice addition, albeit late was the jazz band performing at the end of our dinner. They were a delight and would have been nice during the entire meal, given they started about 9:30pm on a weeknight.",

    "text": "This is an impressively-sized and decorated establishment, with some beautiful art deco fixtures.We had booked a table for 7 and ended up at one of the raised booths at the back which gives you a nice view back over the restaurant floor. We were dressed up but a lot of people were casually dressed which somewhat ruins the aesthetic but is probably good for tourists who have been out all day sightseeing. It's perfectly placed for a pre-theatre meal.The menu is quite complex and a fair amount of it is just in French which even though I have a fairly good basic command of the languages left me in the dark about what a fair few of the hors d'oeuvres and sides were.The prix fixe is cheap but I didn't think any element of it (carrots, steak hache, chocolate torte) looked particularly appetising although hear no significant complaints.My meal started well with decent bread and butter and steak tartare, which came without an egg but was very well flavoured. It came with worcestershire sauce and tabasco and I was a bit confusedMy main, the plat du jour - saucisse with puy lentils, was disappointing in that in came with no sauce so was basically dry lentils and meat. The saucisse tasted nice but appeared to be supplemented with a lot of bits of bacon which I didn't see the point of as they distracted from the taste of the saucisse. At \u00a315.75 this was terrible value for what you got and I would advise against ordering this. Particularly bad as it was the dish of the day, which means the restaurant is highlighting a mediocre dish as the one to go for that day! Our sides of mashed potato and creamed spinach were fine, nothing of note.It took FOREVER to get the bill and during this time we were left without any drinks, even water. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes after we would have liked to leave, even after having stood up and put our coats on it took a few minutes before someone arrived (our main waiter having disappeared).Overall not bad but and a very interesting set up and history, but would not order the saucisse de toulouse again.",

    "text": "Just to preface, I live in France, so I've eaten a lot of French food and at brasseries. I'd probably give this 3.5 stars - the food is good, but not completely amazing, having been spoiled by all the French food in France.This place is huge, with a large dining room with wood panels, and ornate decor. It's quite pretty and the tables are nice with cloth napkins and wooden booths and tables. It's a good place for a business lunch or dinner. We went for lunch at 12:30 pm with a party of 3 and it was empty when we walked in, but the restaurant was full by 1 pm, so it's good to make a reservation ahead of time if you can.They have a wide selection of starters, entrees, sides and desserts - way more selection than you'd find a traditional brasserie. The complimentary bread is just okay, didn't seem particularly fresh to me - the texture was a bit too dense and wasn't quite as light or crunchy on the outside as I usually like.I got the salmon with a cream leek sauce which was good, but there's nothing except the fish with the dish - no potatoes or vegetables, it's just the piece of salmon in the sauce. If you want sides, you have to order them. In short, the salmon was good, the leek sauce was good, but a bit expensive for what you get with no sides for \u00a317.75 for the dish.The fries we ordered as a side were a disappointment, they were soggy and cold. Definitely skip these - they weren't great.All in all, a good place for a business dinner or lunch if you're expensing your meal. It wasn't very \"traditional\" French or as good as food in France, but I didn't expect it to be. I thought it was a tad too expensive for what you get for the main dishes for them not to come with any kinds of sides. Just okay for me - I probably wouldn't come back on my own accord, but would eat here if someone else in my party really wanted to come here.",

I adore the art deco theme, old posters and photographs of shows, musicians, and dancers covering the walls. Everything is elegant without being tacky. Head downstairs for a breathtaking view of balcony overlooking the crystal chandelier and tile floor. The staff are very kind and attentive, and continuously check in on you without being to helicopter-y. Cafe pricing is a bit high for a simple drink like fresh mint tea (2 pots of hot water with mint leaves and a few bite-sized pastries will set you back about \u00a315) but the classy and quiet ambiance is worth it. There is also live music in the later evening without a cover charge, and in the heart of city center, it's a rare find.",

Descending the stairs from the small ground floor bar to the expansive room is quite an experience.The menu is reasonably priced for the location and there's a decent wine list, and \u00a0a vegetarian menu available on request, though it's not on the website.Food is decent rather than outstanding but is good value for the product very. On my recent visit, the starter of grated celeriac in mustard mayonnaise and the pudding of Ile Flottante were the highlights, though my main of artichokes in lemon sauce was a little bland. Bread and tap water arrived without asking. A bottle of Viognier was very pleasant and good value at \u00a324.The total cost of two three course meals, wine and coffee, with service, came to just under \u00a3100. Service was a bit patchy as it was very busy, with lots of big groups. I suspect your experience will depend enormously on exactly where you sit.There's a cloakroom available and later in the evening a piano sets off the entertainment.So, it's great for an experience but not an intimate evening out.",

    "text": "Massively impressed with this place. We had passed it, looked in and thought we should give it a go some time. And so, last day of the boy's summer holiday, we popped in early lunch to see if we could get a table.First, the place is truly spectacular. It takes about 5 mins to get to the dining room from the street. As you descend down you pass wonderful old French posters and art works and it all has a very grand feeling as you pass a couple of receptions and a private bar. It's on the site of the old Atlantic bar and they haven't changed the layout much if that gives you an idea. The dining room is huge and noisy, bustling with customers and waiters dashing to serve them. The huge windows to the side give the impression of being outside but of course you are a long way underground. It's all great fun and there is a real good mix of people there, young old, snazzy, scruffy. The place has the feel of the old French brasseries. It has really pulled that off well. I loved the feeling.But that's not the best bit. Next the food.The menu is proper old French brasserie stuff. Confit duck, steak hache, \u00a0 \u00a0Charcuterie etc. A good few traditional starters to choose from, much less main courses. You are certainly not overwhelmed with choice.The boy had the set menu of two courses, starting with a carrot salad which was really lovely and simple. Julienned carrot tossed in vinegar and herbs and olive oil. I loved the simplicity. Tasted great. He followed with a simple burger, minus bun and perfectly cooked stiff fries. I had the grilled sardines. They came butterflied, three of them on a bed of black olives and cherry tomatoes. They were done perfectly again. Simply presented, well prepared with a slightly burnished skin as I think all oily fish should have. The missus had poached salmon which was poached perfectly. The accompanying cucumber and chive really set it off and the potato salad (which looked on presentation like it could have come from a can) was delicious.What I liked most was that there was no pretention. The food was bold and simply served. Nothing complicated, each dish standing out for what it was. This is such a refreshing change. Very brave when you consider they could have gone as overboard as with the surroundings.But that's not the best bit. The best bit is this. Check it out...The boy's set meal was \u00a38. Yup. \u00a38.My sardines were \u00a39. And I think the salmon was \u00a311.this to me represented unbelievable value. Not just for the food, but for the whole experience. All this with lovely chewy French loaf for the table. And slap bang in the middle of piccadilly. This is no tourist trap. This is just unbelievable value simple food in lush surroundings in the middle of London. On the starter menu you can get soup for under \u00a33! Again, it's simple, nothing fancy, but all the better for it. But to think you can get that today in the heart of London at such a great place is frankly unbelievable and I applaud Corbin and king for what they have done here. Great stuff. I will be going back again and again.",

You step in and you think you're in the wrong place- a 1920s theatre, descending two or three flights of stairs you pass a private concert going on a bubbly bar, a 'ticket office' and finally arrive at the main dining area (all named in French). The dining room is expansive, alight with atmosphere with impressive bread sculptures that stood out along with the light marble walls & grand chandeliers. The good is very reasonable for tourist town, London. The service is all French and high standard. Highly impressive and would recommend to anyone, the only thing was we were cramped for space, they tried to get too many covers in the space they had. We could over hear both tables conversations next to us-not ideal! All in all, a great evening with a very different feel and warm surroundings.",

The chicken liver parfait is absolutely delicious, although fairly unremarkable in that it was no better than you would expect good parfait to be. But that suited me fine. The frogs legs were excellent, worth a visit to try these alone. For the main course I had steak hache which was very nice except they aren't allowed to serve it medium rare - i had to have medium which is not to my taste. Our waiter explained this is for health and safety reasons. Does anyone know why this would be the case when you can happily order steak tartare across London (not here though)?",

More troubling is being served a cold, yes cold, steak \u00a0and not the cut ordered.2 higher ranking service professionals did attend our table \u00a0and we had not actually complained in any negative way \u00a0one of whom seemed to think it would be beholden upon us to share her mission to inform management of what they have to deal with \u00a0rather than take affirmative action to improve our experience.Snark over \u00a0it was low priced for such a glamorous dining room in the heart of London \u00a0and while I feel a bit cheated \u00a0I may try again on a quieter day.",

    "text": "When I was a young West Ender, a posh night out ended up in the familiar confines of Joe Allen. Slightly dirtier ones usually found you gurning round a four top in Balans or playing pinball up the rickety staircase of Bar Italia. You'd gone very wrong if you wound up in Shuttleworths... I was a little young for the Atlantic, that louche, debauched bacchanal under the old Regent Palace Hotel. It's to that space that we head tonight, now home to the newly launched Brasserie Zedel.It's not an expensive joint. And that's an understatement. Three courses for three people, coffee, wine and service clocked in at \u00a390, phenomenal value given the quality. If this was a vanity project by new restaurateurs, you'd laugh at the prices and imaginging the rows with accountants, vowing to get as much grub down your neck as you could before they whacked the prices up. It's not though, it's the latest venture by two of the biggest restaurant thoroughbreds this country has produced, Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. If the brains behind The Wolesley and The Ivy think that this is the way the industry should price, prepare for the cutting of some prices or the sharpening of some knives...Bright, airy, tall and gilded. Even though you're in a basement, the whole experience is like being thrust into an Art Deco inspired cruise ship for the night. You could dress up to match if you want to but if you don't really want I can't see that anyone would mind. The menu reads like a 'Best of France - Bourgouis edition' cookbook from the 70's, in a really good way. Hefty, non sharing, mains are generally under a tenner, soups are less than three quid and other starters swirl the heady heights of a fiver. Substantial plated salads and big slabs of p\u00e2t\u00e9 are consumed with gusto while I chow down on escargot as garlically exotic as you remember from that first school trip to France as a 12 year old. Steak hache is made on site, a triumphantly large patty of the trimmings from proper cuts of beef, a tartare burger if you will. It was a little too solid in the construction but really well flavoured, coming with an inclusive metal cone of proper French fries (another pet hate of expensive places, the sides that should go with the dish should NOT be added chargable extras) and lashings of pepercorn sauce for \u00a38.75.If the profiteroles were a tad over baked, it only served to highlight that these weren't perfectly pre-prepared, plumped generic pap but homemade and fresh from the subterranean bakery that had been responsible for an excellent (free) bread basket earlier. Arriving in London today, you couldn't ask for a better catch all recommendation than Zedel, it's there for groups of friends, good for serious foodies glomming at the novelty value, perfect for a classy date and suitable for clients and parents without any of them thinking you're skimping.I hate to end the review by keeping coming back to it, but i still can't understand why they're charging so little for this food. Sure it's what you'd expect to pay in a provincial French brasserie but this is a newly and expensively renovated spot on Picadilly Circus. They must really hate their accountant, or the rest of the industry...",

I decline. they insist. we try it. the concensus is \"no\". we order a different bottle. again they bring us a younger vintage (is it me or is someone having a laugh here?). we are fobbed off with the explanation that the wines change in February. I explain that it's mid- February. we wait. we get a bottle of wine which is the grape and vintage on the wine list. oh thank goodness!we drink wine. we talk. we wait for our table. after 50 minutes we ask how the table is doing because it's now 9:35 and we are tired. small acknowledgement at the bar. I go back to the maitre'd. he says just another 10 minutes, \"max!!\" we wait another 20 minutes. we see quite a few empty tables that can seat four. we are a party of three.we are shown to a table. the band is playing. we are deposited under their noses. I can see three empty tables within a table-length of us, further from the volume of the brass section. we can hardly converse. the tables around us fill up. we order. we eat. it's good food. the clock is now ticking. would we like some dessert? one of us has to go home to Brighton. we explain that and ask for an espresso. no, they don't do an espresso. they do a cafeti\u00e8re. fine, lets have that. time passes. the Brightonian has to leave. we discuss the bill. she leaves. the coffee arrives - we explain its too late for three, but if we could please just have coffee for 2. \"okay\" they say, and whisk it away.we eat our dessert. it's delicious. we drink our single cafeti\u00e8re. we ask for the bill. we have been charged for an extra cafeti\u00e8re. and a discretionary 15% service charge. we don't pay that. we pay under a 10% tip and hope they'll get the message.ha! the place is almost full when we leave at 11pm. I don't think they'll get the message. we joke about how familiarly French it feels",

    "text": "The secret is obviously out, so I figured I should add my own review.Two weeks ago after a theatre trip - the other half and I looking to have a nightcap decided to try the bar at Zedels. It was a Saturday night post 10pm, but when we walked in to the beautiful art deco Bar Americain it was virtually deserted. Quickly we were sat at a table, and a cocktail menu was bestowed upon us.Here's our rules on new cocktail bars.He will order an Old Fashioned - if it arrives too quickly, or is grainy - they fail.I will order a Manhattan - no one asks me how I want it - they fail.Do I get free snacks, I would also like some free snacks.And how did Bar Americain fare, well you know the answer, this is a 5 star review. Flying colours, a little dish of cashews preceded our perfectly made drinks. And then we got to thinking...the cocktails were perfectly made, they came with snacks, the room is beautiful - and they were under a tenner. It would be rude not to try something else. We got really drunk - it was great.This Wednesday I arranged to meet a friend there - and what a contrast. The bar was PACKED. The host found us the only spare table, but my secret was ruined...everyone was here. But what did I expect from such a great find. Like me anyone who had been there had decided to turn it into \"their\" bar.So after a cocktail or two we headed into the brasserie for dinner. Only a 20 minute wait for a table so we sat at the bar and had a very reasonable half bottle of chablis before being shown to our table. The food was incredible, we both ordered the same thing - grilled Daurade, with a side of green beans. Followed by a cheese plate and a mille feuille which we shared. Just like the bar, amazing value. Great food in a transformative setting - this place is grander than a duke and made us feel like ladies.If it wasn't already so popular I would have never shared this new find, but I urge you to try it. Go now.",

    "text": "I was prepared to be disappointed by Brasserie Zedel purely on the basis of my bigotry as a Londoner against anything within spitting distance of Piccadilly Circus. How wrong could I be? Turns out... enormously. To begin with, the Beaux-Arts/Art Deco interior of the old Atlantic \u00a0has been fastidiously preserved and the fittings gilded in a manner befitting a similar spree of gilt-edged pimping in 1980s Paris during the Mitterand-era. The effect of stepping off the street and descending underground in what actually feels a rather artificial entrance to the bars and restaurant adds to the experience of detachment from the real world and being spirited away to another land (... and time?).The service is French in the best way - well-trained career waiters who may appear detached, but are there whenever you need anything and always hover on the right side of professional and efficient. In fact on the first occasion I ate here, our waiter was straight out of central casting, an ethereal, almost corpse-like gentleman with a deeply sardonic wit and ability to know what we wanted before we'd asked.The food is brilliant, just what you'd want from a grand brasserie; andouillette, onglet, confit de canard and choucroutte are all present and correct, including those starters one seeks out of curiousity and novelty (cuisses de grenouille, escargots). The prices are frankly incredible, and can only be explained, I imagine, by the number of covers, table turnover and late opening hours. There is no sting lying in the drinks list either - Breton cider, 'pichets' of whites and reds (\u00a36-\u00a310) and well-priced bottles are available as well as own-brewed beers (the 'brasserie' moniker is merited) and cr\u00e9mants/champagnes.Food of this type and quality is available in bistros and brasseries around France, but there is no real reason to expect it outside of the country due to lack of competition, cultural and historical reasons and the ability to dress it up a little more and charge twice the price in London. The fact that you can walk in off the main tourist drag to have what is ostensibly a simple but high quality meal for pittance in W1 is rather incredible.Many an eloquent blogger and critic have waxed lyrical over the value for money of the overall Z\u00e9del experience, so let a simple, fawning francophile state the obvious one more time - you'll eat and drink very well in opulent surroundings and leave feeling like a thief when the bill is settled.",

The decor makes you feel like you truly have gotten on the Eurostar and into a Grand Brasserie in seconds. The food here is also absolutely spectacular. I had the Soup du Jour for starters which was a butternut squash soup which was amazing, and my dinner partner had a pate, which was also absolutely stunning. She had the Sea Bream for a main, which was done to perfection and I had the Onglet Grillee. The sauce was a tad bit too salty for my taste, but overall everything was done beautifully. We decided to indulge because it was my birthday and got two desserts. The profiteroles with chocolat chaud and the creme brulee. AMAZING. Including a bottle of wine, 3 separate courses and \u00a378. Service was impeccable too. They didn't let me pour my own wine nor water and very attentive. It started to get less so when it got packed, but otherwise, definitely a go'er backer.I'm definitely headed back and a great place that's opened up in Soho for finer brasserie dining.",

With the odd pretty young thing mistakenly thinking this is stylish and up market.Food was rather more like the guests than the decor ... Service was sub cafe rouge ... Over all experience was cheap ... And slightly unsatisfactory ... Much like the coffee",

Being right in the heart of the West End (Piccadilly) it lends itself to a nice after dinner stroll along regent street as well.Good place...",

Moderately priced, and not at all bad considering the venue and level of service received. We received complimentary aperitifs after dinner and had a great experience.",

    "text": "After a pretty great first experience I had medium expectations of my second. \u00a0I knew the food wasn't great going into it, but thought the room and service would more than make up for any shortcomings.Well, after having eaten at Delaunay the other night, and at quite a few other beautiful restaurants in London in the past 2 weeks I am no longer so impressed by aesthetics alone, and realize they only act as a bolster to a good experience rather than a positive attribute in their own right.Service this time was absolutely crap. \u00a0Our server was beyond clueless, didn't know the menu, and had to be flagged down at every interaction. \u00a0He could not even clear the plates properly; he leaned over us and made an absolute racket which was really quite annoying. \u00a0When we wanted to leave, we waited forever for the bill, and then we asked for the card machine, he was mid-conversation (def not work related) with another server and ignored us, grabbed the machine, went back to conversation, and then finally came back to us after my having to interrupt him a 2nd time.I thought the food was a 2/10 -- edible, but just (deserts were fine though). My celeriac remoulade tasted like it was doused in fish stock, my beetroot and lettuce salad had 4 miniscule slices of beets, and the lettuce wasn't cleaned properly as I bit into some rocky piece. \u00a0My main, the plaice, was fairly good on one side (firm and slightly crisp), but when flipped to the other the fish was very soft, and the skin/coating was a gloopy mess. \u00a0My parents both had the same problem with their fish as well.My sis had a rib-eye steak which was tough and flavourless, my wife had a hanger steak which was better meat, but almost inediblely rare and came covered with a acrid onion sauce. Our side of creamed spinach looked and tasted like baby food, and the fries were not 1/2 as good as McDonalds (crispy-ish but had a very dense bite).Desert and drinks, however, were good.,After such an awful experience I am even doubting whether I even like the room -- yes its obviously lavish, but is cavernous, and underground. \u00a0We were considering removing the service charge (something I've maybe done once in my life), but we simply couldn't bother having to deal with the fallout.Would never go again, and am dreading my dinner at Colbert next week (can't get out of it im afraid).",

    "text": "You start your Brasserie Zedel experience in a ground-level tabac-styled room and then descend a chintzy jazz portrait-lined staircase to the basement hallway. From there, you have three options: a room dedicated to cabaret (tonight's entertainment was a transvestite jazz singer not dissimilar looking to Jim Henson's Miss Piggy), the low-lit and swanky looking American Bar and the main dining room. We only visited the latter. The main dining room is an incredible space, reminiscent of Paris institutions like La Coupole and Bofinger. It's covered in gold leaf, marble and looks absolutely the part, much more convincing that the entry halls which look more Las Vegas than Paris. Our waiter was a little slow in first arriving, but attentive and professional throughout the meal. A complimentary basket of bread was brought up. I ordered the onion soup to start, my partner ordered the oysters. The onion soup was good, although hardly much of an achievement to do a good French onion soup. Could've done with some more cheese. Her Oysters were very nice, and pretty reasonable. For mains I opted for the Choucroute Alsacienne, and she had the \u00a0Beef Bourguignon. Again, mine was a simple dish that didn't really blow me away, although you might wonder if this dish is really capable of being that amazing anything. It did the job, adequately. Her beef was a little tough and chewy, the accompanying mash good. For desert we shared the Gateau Opera, which was delicious. We both opted for the house red, pretty reasonably priced and quite tasty, although I'm no expert. Let's be honest, this place is trying to offer a Parisienne Brasserie experience in London's West End, and it does that, to an extent, only perhaps in the same way that the Venezio hotel offers you a little Venice amidst Las Vegas' strip. This is not to say it wasn't enjoyable; it was, it just isn't really anything mind-blowing. Its solid takes on French staples aren't going to offer any serious competition for a good Parisienne brasserie, but if you want a decent taste of France in a beautiful, opulent venue for not a great deal of money, you'll probably enjoy it.",
