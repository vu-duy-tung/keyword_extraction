Poppadum, poppadum? No thanks - give me a second to look at the menu. Under pressure, I thought I'd ask to order starters to buy ourselves time to chose our mains. No - we're too busy - the restaurant is fully booked - we were told by a very rude waiter. I was appalled. My friend had to convince me not to storm out. The food came, then was removed by the waiter who swished the plate fishing around for lamb - \"OK - it's fine. I thought it was chicken...\" - not the nicest the feeling and obviously no apology. The food was bland. I did enjoy the peshwari nan though - it had a perfect texture and a very pleasant taste. The rice had gone a little hard from sitting out for too long - I had sylheti lamb which I thought was really undercooked and the tarka daal was not good. Our plates were removed and the bill thrown onto the table. A minute later, I saw a pair of terrified eyes on my friend's face. When I turned around I saw the waiter making signs at her to pay up... Just don't go.",

We walked up and down the street talking to the guys hawking places asking who would make the spiciest curry! We settled on Aladin. We walked in and sat down, and a guy comes over to us and whispers \"you got alcohol\"...my bf was like \"um no\" we thought we were in like major trouble with the brick lane mafia or something. Come to find out they dont sell alcohol but they allow you to BYOB, AWESOME! So the bf went down the street to a corner store and brought back some Cobras/King Fishers. We pretty much let the waiter order for us...told him we wanted SPICY! It was soooo good we had the Chicken Dansak and Chicken Naga. Cant wait to go back!",

    "text": "My daughter's birthday week-end and she wanted a trip down the smoke. Saturday we visited the excellent Camden Market and then on to Greenwich. An overnight stay at the Hilton Docklands and then out to Amy Child's Salon. Back in the afternoon and to Madame Tussaud's, finally as a thank you to dad she let me visit the famous Brick Lane for the first time. The concentration of restaurants in Brick Lane is impressive and even on a Sunday the parking wasn't easy but we eventually struck lucky in a side street. We walked nearly the length of Brick Lane and ran the highly irritating gauntlet of the persistent touts and their offers. We finally chose the Aladin for no good reason. Perhaps we were persuaded by the Best in the World banner and it did look popular, perhaps it was because we didn't want to have to fight our way passed the touts back up the road, or was it the 20% discount offered? We couldn't get into the Aladin but were found a table in the adjacent Raznul restaurant instead. The decor is basic and a few repairs and tidying up wouldn't go amiss. Thinking this wasn't the Aladin and perhaps just a relation we nearly left, however we were assured it shared the same kitchen and after all it's the food that matters. Our waiter wasn't overly friendly, he seemed to be impatient which was surprising considering the restaurant was 3/4 empty. It was after 8.00pm and with a drive back to Dudley to look forward to we unfortunately had to go straight into the mains. To sum up briefly, the mains were good with the sundries being just ok. We had no complaints but likewise there was nothing special either. My opinion is that the Aladin is a typical balti house, certainly not bad but we couldn't find anything very good or different about it either plus they don't do deserts apart from kulfi. More importantly they also don't do itemised bills and we were overcharged plus we then had to ask for our discount. Unsurprisingly my conclusion is that it probably isn't the best curry house in the world indeed I would be extremely surprised if it was the best in Brick Lane.",

We finally got a table and then waited 30 minutes for anyone to take our order after which we were asked to move to a smaller table as they could squeeze four people onto ours.

I asked for the bill which took 15 minutes, I left cash on the table and after 20 minutes waiting for my change to come back (over \u00a35.00), we gave up and made an escape. Utterly disappointing.

They were almost inedible! \u00a0Next problem, \u00a0after 50 minutes of waiting the food came. We believe they make you wait so you buy papadoms which cost .75 pence each and then they charge extra for the chutney. When the food eventually came each and every dish was so overly spicy hot that they were practicaly inedible! If not for the price which wasn't terrible but still at tourist level, we would have not forced the food down and would have walked out!

Me and my group got tikka masala, lamb rogan, paneer, and vegetable tikka. The tikka masala tasted sweet and syrupy (I kid you not), and we even asked for it spicy. The paneer was bland and tasteless, there was absolutely no care taken with it. \u00a0The only passable dish was the lamb rogan, and even with that, the tomatoes were barely cooked (which is not something you normally find with indian food).

We walked past a number of curry restaurants, complete with men outside attempting to seduce us into their stores - oh, by the way, guys? Saying 'hi' in Japanese to two Chinese girls isn't going to work in your favour - and settled on Aladin, mainly due to the good prices and the list of accolades posted in the windows.The place was pretty busy when we arrived at 4:30, yet we were seated and attended to fairly quickly. Neither one of us had any idea what to order at first (the menu isn't particularly descriptive, so our waiter kindly fielded our questions), but I ended up getting the chicken dansak with plain naan, while my friend had the chicken ceylon. Both dishes were tasty, though for a 'medium hot' dish, mine definitely could have been spicier. All in all, though, if you have a hankering for solid curry that won't break the bank, Aladin is a good place to check out.",

As soon as we were seated, he recommended us a few of their most famous dishes and within 5 minutes we were tucking in! The bengali Tikka curry was delicious, as was tandoori chicken and the vegetable naan. We all really enjoyed our food and the whole restaurant had a great atmosphere. So if you are on Brick Lane, make this place your first port of call!",

No better than the other average curry houses along Brick Lane. And the service - pretty appalling. As soon as we finished our food the unashamedly asked us to leave so they could sit another table. Talk about being treated like crap! I would definitely avoid this place.",

We didn't get any special deals outside though which is unusual for Brick Lane! We also got charged an extra few pounds which was cheeky as the bill didn't have a summary of each item just a total and we calculated it and even with a service charge added on they still over charged us! Imagine if they're doing that to everyone! cheeky!",

    "text": "A last-minute Twitter shout-out resulted in tons of great Brick Lane curry house recommendations, and we opted for this one because of its location at the right end of the strip for our next destination. Having battled through the gauntlet of restaurant staff trying to entice you through their doorways - one of whom took one look at me and decided that screaming \"TWO BOTTLES OF FREE WINE!!!\" in my face would be the best approach (to be fair, he's not far off) - we made it to Aladin and were promised a \u00a37.95 special offer. This included a starter, a curry and a rice or naan bread, plus a free drink. It was only when I looked at the drinks 'menu' that I realised it was BYO. Bugger. But we couldn't be arsed to go out to fetch booze so we happily made do with soft drinks. Despite what I've read in other reviews about the service I thought it was pretty good, and certainly friendly. My paneer and spinach pancake starter was huuuge - and delicious - but sadly it totally filled me up before my main course. So although I wasn't really that impressed with my curry (can't remember which one I chose now), it could have been because I simpy had no appetite left. This was only my second visit to a Brick Lane curry house, and it was certainly a better experience than the first. Then again, I can't really remember too much about the first time if I'm completely honest (one of those nights...). So if you're heading to Brick Lane and want a recommendation for a decent curry house which won't set you back more than a tenner a head, you could do a lot worse than Aladin. Just remember to bring your own...",

A Chicken curry, one big Chef's specialty : chicken marinated in a creamy minty spinach sauce, plain nan bread, some mushroom pilau rice & two juices for less than \u00a330. As much as the food deserves 5 stars, the service do not even deserves one. The only available waiter was absolutely not helpful : my coat was still unbutton that I've been asked on & on for a starter or a thing to share. Then we had to signal him a few time to pass the order or even to pay the bill. The waiter was just to busy talking with a mate on the opposite side of the room. But, let's be grown ups here. The food is really great and I will definitely go back there again, and guys, give them a chance ;)",

I actually really enjoyed this lamb curry that I had (I don't remember what it was - it was a 'chef special').The pros: - They take large group reservations and gave us a discount off the total bill for booking in advance- Massive menu, reasonable prices, and food was good- BYOB, no corkage feesThe cons:- Service was the biggest issue. For a group of 10 people, they should have blocked out at LEAST an hour and a half. We were rushed out of there in less than one hour. Towards the end they were hassling us and telling us that they needed the table, before people were even finished eating. This is an unacceptable way to manage a restaurant.- They tried to pull a fast one on us re: the group booking discount. We looked at the bill at the end and it wasn't there, and we had to flag down the waiter and ask them for it. What?!? Did they think we were not going to notice?? I thought this was a very skeevy move.- They only take one or two credit cards per bill. Come on guys... this isn't technological limitation, everyone knows how those portable card machines work. This is laziness.I wish I could give this place more stars because the food was really quite good. The horrendous service killed our experience.",

We took a risk and went down after 7PM on a Saturday night with no reservations. \u00a0Even though the place was packed, we only waited about 15 minutes. \u00a0The guy out front was really good about managing the waiting patrons and preventing people from sneaking in. \u00a0We were seated next door in Nazrul, which is owned by Aladin and has the Aladin menu (the two restaurants are physically connected inside as well). \u00a0 I had heard that their King Prawn Biryani was really good, so I ordered that, while my husband ordered the Chicken Kurma, a coconut curry dish. \u00a0We also got some Peshwari Nan. \u00a0Everything was great. \u00a0I really liked the biryani - a very flavorful, mild dish with plenty of prawn. \u00a0And it came with an outrageously delicious vegetable curry. \u00a0My husband was pleased with his curry, which was rich in flavor, not too much heat. \u00a0Service was good, more so once the order was in.The overall experience was fine, until a huge 30+ group of twenty-somethings came in, filling over half the restaurant. \u00a0Not only were they insanely loud, but they had brought champagne, which upon opening exploded in an arc over their table and spraying the family next to us. \u00a0No acknowledgment or apology for the family - they just went on being rambunctious and oblivious. \u00a0Fortunately we were well into our meal, but we kind of rushed to finish so we could get out of there. \u00a0Not really the fault of the restaurant, but still put a damper on the end.All in all, I can definitely say Aladin has earned its great reputation.",

I scoped around online and the general consensus was Aladin is the best curry house in the area. We walked in and were offered a 20% discount and quickly seated to a booth. I was extremely unimpressed by the restaurant. The ambience is dingy, with crappy paintings and dirty booths. They quickly served us oily pappadums with a plate of sauces. The strangest was the mint sauce which was a bright yellow (yuck). I ordered a cauliflower curry and yellow daal. The cauliflower was oily and doused in a flavourless tomato sauce. The daal was loaded with garlic and just not good. The naan we ordered didn't seem to have been cooked in a tandoor and was really not up to standards.When our bill came it didn't include the discount we were offered and we had to remind them to reduce the price. I'm really confused by the high rating as the food is really terrible and the ambience just didn't cut it.",

I couldn't even finish half of what was served.

They started off by luring us inside by offering us a 15% off discount off of our bill. Inside, we ordered 3 dishes, then we asked for an order of naan bread. When the server asked us how many orders of naan, we asked how many pieces came in one order...he then asked us what discount we received outside. We told him 15% and saw him write 3 on his notepad. Finally after waiting for 30 minutes for our food to come we asked for one order of rice... the waiter came with THREE orders-- one for each of us. Of course, we were charged for the three plates of rice and in the end were not even sure if the 15% discount was applied. There was no way of knowing because the menu had no prices included. How else will you know what is 15% off?Definitely think I was taken advantage of because of my American accent-- I've been here before with a British friend and was treated completely differently. It's also fortunate for Aladin that gratuity comes included... would not have left a tip at all.",

I had my reservations upon entering the restaurant -- mostly the loud/BYOB crowd practically spilling out of the restaurant -- but the \"bouncer\" at the previous restaurant swore by the spot as the most celebrated in London for Indian food. So so happy we stayed to experience the food AND service. Both surprisingly top-notch. Friendliest waiters -- even gave us extra mango/coconut naan (get it!!) on the house AND a discount on the entire meal. We probably were waited on by 3 different servers but each of them were so attentive to our food + experience. Apparently, they just underwent a big management change and are trying to build up a positive reputation for not only food but also service. We had the chef's special -- grilled lamb + grilled chicken marinated and tossed with special sauce, respectively -- and omg I am salivating as i speak about it. Have yet to have a more authentic, flavorful, satisfying Indian meal. Do yourself a favor and go, go go! Such a great and verry filling (wear loose clothing) way to end our trip.",

    "text": "I have so much to say about this little strip of Brick Lane! \u00a0I've had good and bad, but, well, on to the deets!Aladin is in the middle of a cluster of Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants. \u00a0Apparently, this is Prince Charles' favourite. \u00a0Apparently, Ainsley Harriot loves this restaurant the most (me: really? \u00a0The chef with the massive hands? \u00a0server: yes! \u00a0Him!). \u00a0Apparently, Aladin has won the \"best curry 2014\" award. \u00a0I don't know if any of this is accurate. \u00a0But, well, *I* like it, so that counts for something, right? \u00a0The reality of Brick Lane is that it's a bit of a gong show, but it's what I like...it's not the best Indian food I've had in London (this feels like treason to commit to type) but it's the best whole dang experience I've had. \u00a0It starts when you're out on the street and reps from each of the restaurants come up and try to coax you towards their place. \u00a0The \"deals\" they offer are usually in the range of \"20% off!\" or \"I'll give you X combo deal!\" or \"rice and naan for free!\". \u00a0Most recently we snagged the \"starter, main, rice or naan for 12 pounds\" \"deal\". \u00a0I write deal in quotes not because it wasn't a good food/money investment, but because I think it's a pretty standard offer at the restaurant; it's not like we really negotiated hard. \u00a0Sidebar, though: especially if you're in a larger group you can finagle some good \"group deals\".So, inside it's pretty loud, and busy, and hot. \u00a0I'm pretty sure Prince Charles has never hung out on the uncomfortable faux velvet banquette. \u00a0Bollywood music pipes in, and you can barely hear it. \u00a0Many servers wear Britney Spears-esque headsets. \u00a0It's all kind of frenetic, but I find service super polite and attentive. \u00a0We ate some lamb kebabs, and bhajis to start (bhajis are just alright here; I think the spicing could be kicked up), but the real star were the mains. \u00a0Lamb rogan josh was FABOOSH as was a coconut chicken curry with just the right amount of heat. \u00a0Naan were hot and fluffy, and our freebie drinks - mango juice and a flat (wah!) Diet Coke - were totally fine (less so if we had had to pay for them, but a-ok given that they were part of the \"freebies\" thrown in).On the topic of hydration...IMPORTANT note, booze hounds of Londontown! \u00a0It's BYOB. \u00a0No corkage fee. \u00a0There's some funny deal with an off-license several doors down, where if you show a certain business card you get 20% off your wine. \u00a0Honestly, it all felt very cloak-and-dagger to me but it also added to the charm of the whole meal. \u00a0By the time I made it back to Aladin with my bottle, wine glasses had been set out and a server whisked my pinot out of my hands to give a v generous pour. \u00a0Ai'ght. \u00a0GAME ON.Also, another thing I appreciate about Aladin: it's busy, and it's crowded, but I never feel rushed. \u00a0We hung out post-meal polishing up the wine and never were hassled to speed it up. \u00a0Bill came, hot towels to wash hands, square of orange chocolate...not too bad at all.Yelp note: I can corroborate other reviewers' comments about trying to push extra items / bring items to the table that you never ordered. \u00a0Watch out for the popadum, guys! \u00a0It comes to the table as an \"assumed\" order, and it's only when you get your final bill that you realize 1.50 GBP per person has been added to the tally. \u00a0This is ok by me - I would have ordered them regardless, and the price is good - but the practice itself is shady and presumptuous.",
