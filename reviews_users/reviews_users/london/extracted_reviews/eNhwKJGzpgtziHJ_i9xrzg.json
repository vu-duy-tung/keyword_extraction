Every time I can I stop at Fishbone for fish and chips - It was introduced to me as the \"2nd best chip shop in London\" - I think the ranking might be one off though. I've even considered taking a trip to the UK - primarily to eat here. I've taken colleges and even some locals to this place, with the very consistent response of them wanting to go back soon. Excellent food. Reasonable Price (for London)... I'll be back again...",

    "text": "Having gone upscale at Sweetings a few days prior, I was ready to find a great local Chippy that won't break the bank. \u00a0I walked past this hole in the wall fish and chip shop several times as it was near where I was staying. \u00a0Yelp to the rescue and I see Londoners proclaiming it one of the best Fish and Chips places around. \u00a0Being an American, I prefer not to have skin on my fish. \u00a0I just don't get the whole skin concept. \u00a0The batter doesn't stick to the fish, and the skin doesn't get crispy. \u00a0It says rather slimy in my book, so I end up picking it off, and along with it all the tasty batter. \u00a0Expressing my viewpoint to our very friendly waitress, she promised not to pass judgement on my incorrect assessment and had the chef prepare our fish without skin. \u00a0Now keep in mind it was when they first opened, and perhaps during a lunch rush, this extra preparation may not be possible. \u00a0I definitely got the impressions the chef was doing us a favor. \u00a0For all I know it may have been the first time this request has been made.I had the large piece of Cod, which is politely called the \"regular\" sized cod on their menu. \u00a0It was outstanding and may be the best fried fish I've had. \u00a0Yes better than the \u00a326 version I had at Sweetings, although that was Halibut and this was Cod. \u00a0But doesn't it really just come down to the batter? \u00a0Fish Bone's batter was outstanding. \u00a0My wife felt that the fish got kind of greasy, but I had no problem devouring this beautiful piece of fish. \u00a0Crunchy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, a little malt vinegar and salt.; occasionally dipping in a little tartare sauce. \u00a0This was piping hot and made to order. \u00a0Don't expect fast food here with the fish laying around. \u00a0Most others that I saw come in, had phoned in their order ahead of time. \u00a0There is very limited seating here and it's mostly a to go spot.I made another great discovery. \u00a0Their batter works great around a deep fried sausage. \u00a0These are Halal Beef Sausages. \u00a0It had the texture of a banger, so I'm guessing a little creme is added. \u00a0Unlike Kosher, I don't think Halal has an issue with milk products added with food. \u00a0I could be wrong though. \u00a0Whatever it was, it was a very tasty sausage and frying it made it even better. \u00a0I wouldn't come here without getting a side of those.So this should be a 5 star rating, but the chips just didn't do it for me. \u00a0Since the dish is called Fish and Chips, that's kind of half of the meal. \u00a0Fish Bone won some award for their chips as well, as I saw a sign posted saying Winner of the 2012 Best Chippy Chips Award. \u00a0I don't know, I found them kind of mushy. \u00a0I don't mind a lot of potato to my chips, but these had no crunch on the outside. \u00a0They were good to soak up the Malt Vinegar though, so perhaps that's their concept. \u00a0To me they were average. \u00a0But the fish and sausage was so good here, I still highly recommend Fish Bone. \u00a0And at a very reasonable price too.yelp.com/biz_photos/fish\u2026",

We just found the best, most reasonably priced and least pretentious fish and chips place in London. Portions are on the huge side. I was not able to finish eating a \"regular\" size portion of cod and chips, and this is after walking around the London Zoo all day and having nothing to eat, but a black coffee that morning. It still tastes good the next day! The fish was fresh and the batter was amazing. Nice and crisp. You can sit and eat either inside or outside (weather permitting) or get take away. We have a 10 month old and a 3 year old, since it was getting to be their bedtime it was nice to have the take away option. It doesn't get much more authentically British than this fish and chips place. Service was fast and friendly. Best fish and chips in London. We'll be back!",

    "text": "Dear Yelper, \u00a0I can't leave well enough alone. Feeling restless over Bank Hols, thought I'd write about Fish Bone.My college friend is visiting me from America, you see? Yes. Showed her my favourite London chippy, like Outkast, so fresh so clean, clean and fresh. Nope it is not Rock and Sole Plaice. So 1993, straight Ace of Base. Toff's of Muswell Hill? I'm sure it's great, but it's not as chill. Gig's? Poppies? The Golden Hind? If you go there after this, you deserve a spanked be-hind. Finally, what's the other place, North Sea?Oh no you didn't! Stay there, and don't send a postcard please. All I'm saying Yelper is, you're outta body and mind. If you ever visited Fish Bone and didn't find it simply divine. So, lemme break it down, a little history. Of how much the joint means to me. Since '09 Fish Bone's been my haunt. And I highly suggest you make a quick jaunt. The dudes behind the counter know me very well. Always ready with a smile, a wink or some good banter: like hair, we gel. Yet always professional, knowledgable and very swift. You'll never be waiting for dinner, which would leave most frowning and miffed.Upon exit, you'll never feel un-sated or stiffed. \u00a0And here's why: under 10 quid for a filling dinner, what a price! Plus, like the main dishes, the mushy peas and all the 'fixins' are nice.As for me? Cod and chips girl, that's my go to. And what I recommend to you. Sure they've got all the other extras and stuff. But please give it a skip, or I'm gonna call your bluff. You get so much food, cod perfectly fried and de-boned. I don't think I could finish, even were I munchie'd and stoned. But on a most recent visit I surprised myself. Embarrassed is the better word perhaps, by my bottom shelfBehaviour, and let me say: Ordered a large cod and chips and like Sinatra, I did it my way. Not sure where it goes, maybe my toes? Or perhaps I can artfully hide my foodie-butt in clothes? No shame in my game, I can put it away. Hope my metabolism keeps up till I'm at least 50!But I digress. We were talking about fish: rock, sole, plaice, pike, cod, yes they do impress. Batter fried golden, crispy, hissing, hot and brown. Fresh cut chips, ketchup, squeeze that lemon, pour on the vinegar, and baby boy go to town. But only if you're down, and now you are. Cause when it comes to food, you know this Rhymin' YelpStar Would never lead you astray, or far. So Fair Yelper: If you're near Warren Street Station, feeling the growl of hunger, annoyed. No time to be reticent or coy. Roll through that chippy on 82 Cleveland StreetAnd the next day don't hesitate to repeat. Only thing that's bad about this place is the haze, That I see when I'm hungry and they're not open on Sundays.",

    "text": "British people seem to love fried fish on Friday. Does it hail back to the Catholic days of yore before some King decided to create his own religion to get a divorce? Who knows? What I do know is that the old place I worked would always have fish on Fridays, and while it was subsidized and cheap, it was also pretty terrible.So to continue the tradition at our new place of work, I found Fish Bone for fried fish Friday. We stopped in at around 12:30 and managed to get a table for five people. Now be warned, it's gets SUPER busy at lunch. After sitting there about 15 more minutes the place was fully packed and there was a queue out the door for the takeaway orders.So is it worth it? I say yes. They do a small cod portion (which is nice for lunch, because who wants to eat a giant piece of fish for lunch) and if you get it with chips, it's about \u00a37. (I think it's \u00a36 if you get it to go.) We also split some orders of mushy peas because they give you a nice bowlful of them. The fish is really nicely prepared with a light batter coating it. I really enjoyed the chips as well, but the two Brits in the group weren't overly impressed with them. Maybe it's a British thing. The rest of us really enjoyed everything. We'll probably come back again for fish Fridays. I mean it's not ridiculously expensive for lunch and while it's not as cheap as the food at my old job, it's about ten times as good, so the extra money is totally worth it.",

At \u00a31.90, this is also a complete bargain!The greatest standout for me is also the vibe, the restaurant is really lovely and clean, well decorated and fresh, and the staff are just so friendly and approachable.

The location is inner city, brushing northern SOHO, with some separation from the traffic-heavy tourist areas. There's no shame in eating a meal with yourself, especially when it was as hearty as this.Of course I opted for the main dish - the sit-down fish (cod) and chips, with an additional mushy-peas on the side and a coffee. Take note: sitting in is a bit more pricey than take-away. The interior is friendly, with plenty of sit-in space. I chose to enjoy my meal outside on the outdoor tables. By the time I sat down to eat, I was so depleted I inhaled the food in 10 minutes...and mind you these platters are not small. The fried cod and mushy peas pleased my belly the best, though the flavor could use more amplitude (I ended up using half the ketchup bottle). Fries were standard - homemade flavor, soft and average. All-in-all, if you're wandering the area (perhaps SOHO) and suddenly become seized with a craving for fish 'n chips, this is the place.",

I like mine with a little crispy exterior on them. The thing that really bothered me was the fact that they sell condiments for takeaway. \u00a0The prices overall are very reasonable, so I guess selling condiments is one way they can make up for it. But it still bothers me that you have to pay extra for a cup of ketchup. \u00a0I'll wager that this little restaurant is much better for lunch.

    "text": "After walking in a spiral trying to find the place without a proper map or wifi, I finally came upon Fish Bone. There are a couple of tables outside, three in front of the counter and a bunch in the back dining room. I asked the gentleman at the front what kind of fish he recommended for fish and chips. He was very sweet and had a bit of a sheepish smile, probably trying not to laugh at just how touristy I was being and the American accent to top it off. He said the cod and the haddock were both great but I went with the cod since it was the only one available in a small size. He also asked if I'd have anything to drink and I said, sure a beer. I thought I'd get something local but he offered up a bottle of Stella -- no draughts here. Perhaps Stella is a local favorite; the dude beside me was drinking one too. The fish was great. It was salted and the batter actually had flavor (this was not the case the last time I visited London and had fish and chips). The mushy peas had a fair amount of acidity (tasted of lemon) which I didn't expect and it definitely helped cut through the heaviness of the fry and the tartar sauce...but not my favorite preparation of peas. The fries were typical British fries, no salt and no real flavor. They weren't soggy though so probably successful British fries, just very different from how Americans are accustomed. A heavy hand with the salt shaker and alternating between the vinegar and more tartar sauce certainly helped. Seemed most folks outside and in the dining room were tourists. The dude beside me who was pretty much just hanging out with his iPad and talking with the owners and also the folks who got their f&c take away were the locals -- it was pretty clear! The pricing on the wall is only for take away: small cod \u00a34.4, small chips \u00a32 and mushy peas \u00a31. My eat in order plus the beer was \u00a313.2. Overall, a cute little no-frills mom n' pop place with very good fried fish.",

My husband and I both got the lunch special, large piece of fish, chips, mushy peas and a beer for 14\u00a3. Huge piece of fish is given (either Haddock or Cod, both delicious!!!!) great portion of chips and soup cup full of peas. Everything was SUPER fresh, kudos to cook!!
