I ended up having three flat whites as they were so tasty, just the right balance of milk and coffee. I had the sweet corn fritters with haloumi and avocado, with a side of bacon, and it was just delicious! The fritters were lovely and light, cheese cooked to perfection, and the avocado was ripe and full of flavour. Highly recommended",

I tried the homemade cornbread with honey and an iced coffee. I'm from the South -- pretty sure this is the best cornbread I've ever had. The iced coffee was absolutely delicious. I've also tried the baked eggs with butternut squash and feta cheese, and I've tried the sweet corn fritters. Everything I've had has been tasty and fresh. Very friendly and unpretentious staff. My only complaint...and it's not with them, is the long lines that form on the weekend. It's best to get there at 8am when they open or be ready to sit outside and eat. I'm already getting bummed about leaving this Summer -- am going to miss Milk! Wish they'd open one in Tampa, Florida. :)",

My friend had a Lauren Smoothie: Mango, banana and strawberry with sour dough toast with plum and lavender jam. This was a very cozy cafe with a fantastic menu. Only felt it was missing a sweet option like pancakes. Defiantly will go again if in the Balham area. TIP: Expect a wait time for your table as there is usually a queue. We waited 10-15 minutes.",

Portion sizes are slightly on the small side for the price, but perfect for me as I tend to have the appetite of a flea.

Baked Eggs/Butternut Squash: Alright for the balance, but didn't take the flavor anywhere unexpected. Just well cooked eggs, and well cooked squash. The options that aren't on the menu (soft scramble with cheese and toast) honestly look and probably taste a lot better. Doing the classics and pushing them should also be the standard over the adventurous but that's why I went for a three. Visually not a bad meal to look at.",

I had heard so many great things about this place, and was excited to come and try the baked eggs, corn fritters and horchata. The horchata and green tea were good, but super small! Our waitress was lovely, quick, polite and attentive, but that doesn't make for a return visit.I think the main problem is, they're trying to get so many people through the door that you lose a lot of the details as you're rushed through. It was easy to see evidence of rapid cooking: burnt toast and eggs, tons of butter, and lots of oil remaining in the salsa and fritters. They have a tiny kitchen, and are super popular, so I guess it figures that quality will slip. But the uncomfy seats, and gimmicky branding just scream 'try hard hipster' a little too loudly. Great place to go and pose. Bad place to expect good food.",

We saw empty tables the entire time we were there and no rush to fill them. Not a fan of that! I am however a fan of the delicious food. We all had variations of the sweet Maria... Sweetcorn fritters with avocado and halloumi, topped with salsa, mine with added bacon and a poached egg.It was amazing! I couldn't stop talking about how tasty it was.I washed it down with the Lauren (it had to be done!)... Mango, banana and strawberry juice in a very fitting milk bottle. All in all it was a great brunch experience. Good food, lovely interior, nice setting. It was a little pricey, but I'm okay with that for a fab brunch!",

The weather was unusually glorious, so we sat outside, mainly as I didn't want to wait ages for a table inside. Be mindful, though, that you end up sitting v close to your fellow brunchers, so if you want a particularly private conversation, maybe best for another time. The service was slow, I think we waited at least 20mins. However it was rammed, so understandable. Still, the food was top notch. Like many before me, I went for the sweetcorn fritters, which were light and delicious. My mate had a huge silky portion of scrambled eggs on sourdough.A guy to my left had ordered The Convict - eggs, muffin and crispy bacon which looked excellent also. Price point is average for London, quality definitely above average. Bonus points for outdoor seating in the sun. No crying over Milk here.",

    "text": "5stars from me for this fabulous brunch spot! After a very tiring week, I was v.annoyed to find myself wide awake at 6.30am on a Saturday and I couldn't get back to sleep. Argh! I decided to make the best of it, and a flash of inspiration reminded me that I had bookmarked this place to visit for brunch sometime but I had pretty much decided I would never get there because it is very popular and they don't take bookings, and I'm not (usually) an early riser at the weekend and I do not like to queue for a table! It turns out that being wide awake at stupid o'clock can be the best thing to happen to you! I was about the 3rd person to arrived at m1lk shortly after it opened at 8am so I had my pick if the tables. I chose the best seat in the house, the table right in the tip of this flat-iron shaped building so I had views all around me of the street outside waking up, and the market setting up. It's a slightly self-consciously hipstery dude place - all beards and mismatched furniture and achingly artisanal produce like Brixton sourdough and hay smoked goats curds - but it kinda works and it has a relaxed, buzzy feel about it; and the food - oh my, the food is incredibly good. I ordered what seemed to be a favourite among the yelp reviewers - the sweet Maria sweetcorn pancakes (fritters?) with halloumi and salsa and dry cure bacon and avocado and it was divine. The pancakes were fluffy and sweet, the halloumi and the bacon were salty and savoury with just the right amount of charring to balance the fritters. The salsa was deliciously tangy and sweet and tomatoey - it tasted somehow like summer / and this too was the perfect balance to the creamy mashed avocado on the side. My accompanying flat white was gloriously malty. It's not a cheap brunch option but I don't mind paying a premium for such great quality food that sets you up for the day like this. I'd like to say i will definitely be back, but by the time j left at around 9.30am, the place was mobbed so the chances of me being awake early enough to get a table again are slim. In fact, no, scrub that - I will be back, even if I have to set my alarm clock. A brunch so good, I'd set my alarm at the weekend? There genuinely is no higher praise!",
