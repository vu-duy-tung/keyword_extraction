    "text": "Following in the footsteps of other 'alright to like it' chains Wahaca, Byron and Cay Tre, The Banana Tree Canteen has opened its doors on the lucrative corner of Old Compton and Wardour Street. They've stripped back a relatively new concrete clad build to reveal, surprise shock horror, a bland concrete interior, complete with a ceiling full of air con and shiny piping. Unnecessarily New York.The menu takes you on an interesting twirl round Indochina, an accurate description, if slightly colonial and not a word you hear oft used to describe the Thai / Viet / Malay cuisine on the short snappy list. Like trailblazing neighbour Busbai Eathai (they of the legendary hour long post work queues) it's aimed squarely at the office crowd. There's a good mixture of sweet and spice, nothing too challenging, and you'll get away for \u00a325 a head, perfect for that leaving lunch or a postscript to a few drinks.A selection of mainly fried dim sum style starters thankfully feel homemade, or at least freshly made, and skip the sacherrine sweet MSG chilli toilet cleaner that often accompanies such dishes. We pulled little morsels of salty porky flesh from their bones and hoovered up moist and juicy minced chicken 'moneybags' \u00a0deep fried in bulbous wonton wrappers, pleasingly large, and definitely more than Monica from HR could cope with in one mouthful. Steamed dumplings were sadly less successful. Waterlogged, still born gzoya in an acrid burnt sauce.Mains were pleasingly meaty, coming in two principle variants \u00a0the marinaded to dark almost bitter perfection meat, a char-grilled blackened chilli pork and a blackened beef both fell into this category, or the softer strops of al dente noodle curled round various sauces. The meat arrived punctuated with pillowy mixed vegetable rice and more dipping sauce, they had enough heat for the casual chilli hound, though not enough for me, lacking as they did the kick from the missing, surely obligatory, bottle of Sriracha sauce.Cocktails are a bit of a let down sadly, in an All Bar One kind of way. Overkill of nutmeg gave (too much) Oriental flavour to a watery Mai Tai and the freezer cold lychees in a second were just nasty. That being said, I'm sure I'll be back, it's a sufficiently above average offering in an everyman kind of way and sometimes frankly, only a Thai can satisfy.",

Not sure how long it's been open or why you would care so much about these specific details of my visitation of this establishment.I went with a work group - eight of us, and I was paying - and we were able to get a table without much issue. Initially seated at a table in the middle/back of the room, our seats were stools without backs. I have the posture of a slouching primate, so I was a little disappointed. But, to our luck, we were moved to a table with proper seats. Oh glorious day!I ordered the green curry with some jasmine rice. It was alright, nothing too special and not exactly prepared in a traditional style. But, it was decent - I won't complain. I had a good mocktail, too. Something with lychees in it. And I learned the word mocktail. That was a new one to me! I am so bringing it back to the US. Look out, world. I've got a new word and I am so using it.",

I quite liked the spartan decor but after that I was not best impressed with the experience.We arrived barely after 10pm, and my friend ordered a cocktail only to be told that they were not making any! this after a cocktail specific menu had been put on our table, which I found more than a little odd. We ordered wine and our meals, which were served very swiftly, but mine was at best Luke warm. It was tasty, but particularly greasy and the temperature was a huge issue to me. I can only imagine food is precooked and reheated, or heated - sort of....What really left a bad taste in my mouth was a particular staff member who when lifting the bill and cash asked if we were expecting change, which is A) cheeky B) disconcerting. And the real kicker is that there was \u00a318 due back to us and there is service charge included!!!!! I'm generous but a 75% tip is just a wee bit much for even me. It just really soured the experience and I left far from happy.",

    "text": "Stopped by this branch of the Banana Tree following a comedy show at the nearby Soho Theatre. This location can get extremely busy if you try to get seated around 19:30-20:30, but we arrived just after 21:00 and we were immediately given a table. This is a well located branch of the restaurant and we had visited before because it offers great value with a Tastecard, where diners were offered a 50% discount on their bill without making any reservation. However, after we were seated, we were informed that this branch is no longer accepting the Tastecard. The waitress clumsily advised us than we would still get a 2 for 1 deal on our main meal- this turned out to not be the case- or we misunderstood- as we were provided with a voucher with our bill for this offer on our next visit. Much to the credit of the management, I complained about the confusion and they let us use the voucher on our meal.Aside from the disappointment of losing a great discount with the Tastecard, the Banana Tree is reminiscent of Wagamama in both its setting and style- lots of communal seating and fast pan-indo/asian dishes that come out as they're ready. I personally prefer the food at the Banana Tree to Wagamama and feel you get a lot of value from their main meal upgrade option with rice, prawn crackers, corn fritters and a salad to accompany your main dish. The food always looks fresh and pretty healthy with a generous variety of vegetables- a lack of veg is something that has disappointed me in the past with Wagamama! The flavours are good, consistent and the staff are usually very prompt and friendly. This is a nice alternative to the other similar establishments for a quick and satisfying bite.The only issue we seem to battle with upon each visit is the proximity of tables to neighbours- we always have the misfortune of being placed next to a rowdy and obnoxious group and you literally can't hear yourself think over their conversation. This isn't atypical in these types of restaurants, especially in central London spots- I have just remarked it repeatedly at this location.Shame about the Tastecard discount being pulled, but it does appear that they are trying alternative in-house discounts and offers to customers, so watch this space.",

    "text": "While walking around Soho with an American friend of mine, eager to show some of the culinary delights of the West End to her, we happened upon Banana Tree.Admittedly, it was a tossup between Banana Tree and Busaba EatThai. My friend and I were having a conversation while perusing the area's restaurants about trying new things and being open to new experiences. This is what swung it for me to try Banana Tree. I wish we had gone to Busaba.I did enjoy the buzzing atmosphere here, even on a Sunday evening. However, this is certainly not the place to come for an intimate evening of fine dining. We were greeted by our waitress and took a seat. After a brief look at the menu, I opted for the barbecue style pork with rice and my friend went for the Laksa noodle soup with prawns. To drink, I had a Banana Tree daiquiri with Raspberry and she had a lychee-based drink.The drinks arrived \u00a0and I did feel a little hard done by in that there was barely any alcohol and barely any fruit juice for that matter. It seemed to be a glass full of ice with a little fruit juice for colouring.When the food arrived, I was more than happy with the presentation and taste of my pork dish. However, my dining companion noticed that a number of her prawns were not de-veined meaning that they were essentially offering her \"poo filled prawns\". Our well meaning but linguistically inept waitress had a lot of trouble understanding what my friend's complaint was but eventually took the bowl back to the kitchen.During this time, a rowdy table full of diners joined. In such a open plan dining room as this, before long the volume level was approaching a din. that aspect was not so bad, however, the fact that they kept on shopping chairs and walking around meant that my dining companion was constantly being bumped into and having her chair kicked.Eventually the bowl appeared again and all that they had done was remove some of the prawns. And you guessed it, it just meant that there was a bowl of noodles soup. My friend did attempt to explain this again to the foreign waitress, but to no avail.At least, they did take it off the bill but unfortunately my friend went hungry for the time being.Overall, I enjoyed my food a lot however seeing what a painful process it was for my fellow diner tainted even the tasty food for me.",

The food was delicious, we shared the Chicken & Shitake Money Bags and Kau Chi Dumplings for starters and considering they were starters, the portion sizes were generous. For mains it was even more difficult to decide as a lot of the choices sounded amazing, we both decided to have the Seafood Kari Santan Melayu which was a mixture of seafood, mainly prawns (my favourites) in a beautiful sauce. To drink, we both had a red wine each which was okay but nothing particularly special. The prices are really reasonable especially considering the portions are generous and delicious, the only reason this doesn't get a four star is because the service, although friendly, is really slow - from start to finish - which is a real shame and let down to the place.",

    "text": "Ok, so, I think this might be my first 1* review. And from the looks of it, I'm alone on how awful this place is. Lets recount the night so at least you can understand why. My friend and I usually do noodle night once a month. Last month was at Cha Cha Moon, and this month was supposed to be Ramen Seto, which apparently just shut probably no more than a week ago =`(. Anyway, on the hunt for noodles in soho, and certainly not desperate enough to go to the Lexington Street Wagamamas, we set off to Banana Tree.First off, Banana Tree did not pass the \"Asian Test\". I was the only Asian in the restaurant all dinner long. That should have been a bad sign having walked into the restaurant. And, the funny thing is, I didn't even realize it. My dinner date was the one who mentioned it to me! So, anyway, not minding the fact that we were both ravishing, we sat to order. He calls for a Fried Kway Teow and I go for a Singapore Mee Goreng. I guess I have to now divulge the fact that being Singaporean, I have high standards if you call something Singaporean. But, would you, if you were say French, have higher standards for French cuisine in England?! Okay, getting off the soap box. I should have taken pictures of it when the food arrived, but Fried Kway Teow and Mee Goreng are HIGHLY different dishes in my book, but dinner date and I were perplexed at why they looked so similar. It's basically the same dish, but his supposedly had Kway Teow in it. Now, this, this here is the main reason why this place gets a 1*. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CALL A DISH KWAY TEOW IF YOU ARE USING PHAD THAI NOODLES INSTEAD. Phad Thai noodles are thinner than Kway Teow and INSTANTLY noticeably different. It's like calling Plaice, Haddock and attempting to sneak it by. It's all fish right? WRONG. Ok, another reason why it's 1*?! They used the same bloody paste to make Mee Goreng and the Kway Teow. Mee Goreng paste is redder and usually spicy - due to it's Malay/Indian heritage. Not black sauce based. Redeeming qualities (but never enough to pull it out of 1*) are the cute waiters, the service, the phallic dangling lights over bar tables and the speed in which they fling you outta there. Next time, Cha Cha Moon over Banana Tree ANYDAY.",

I've been here twice: once because we were desperate to eat, and a second time because I was given a voucher to make up for the poor food received from the first time around.First time:Chargrilled blackened chili pork leg, with a combo of glass noodle salad, corn cakes, spicy crackers, steamed Jasmine rice - 8.90 + 3.25 add-on for the combo. \u00a0The combo can only be added onto certain dishes - the ones I wanted were all sold out. \u00a0The waiter was kind enough to let me have the combo add-on with the pork leg meal, which normally isn't included. \u00a0When the dish arrived, I was appalled at the size - I wish I took a picture. \u00a0The leg meat was 3 paper thin, dry slices of meat, 2\" in diameter. \u00a0 This made up my \u00a38.90 portion of the meal. \u00a0The 3.25 add-on filled me up more than the meat. \u00a0I had a word with the waiter about the size, and he apologised - also admitted that because I ADDED on a combo, they decided to cut down my meat portion to make sure I don't waste food, and that its never usually that small. \u00a0Excuse me?! \u00a0I'm paying extra money for sides, so why is my main portion being cut down? \u00a0I should get what I pay for - if there are leftovers, then leave it up to me. \u00a0I've paid for it already, so if there are extras, I can take it home. \u00a0I was given a voucher to come back a second time. Second time: Ying Yang Laksa with Coriander Meatballs - 8.60Chicken + Shitake money bags - 4.90The laksa was OK - rich spicy broth. \u00a0I wouldn't order the money bags again - I felt it was a very poor attempt at making deep fried dumplings. \u00a0Overall: + servers were attentive and accommodating when I complained about the size+ nice atmosphere+ value: affordable, considering its the Soho area+ if you HAVEN'T had SE Asian food before, this will probably be a good medley of spices / flavors to get your feet wet, but: - the food isn't authentic at all. \u00a0A decent attempt, but you'll get the real flavors and food at a non-chain restaurant- beware when adding on a combo, as I've been told by their manager / kitchen staff that they cut down on the main size. \u00a0Not sure if they are still doing this since I complained and said an add-on doesn't give them the right to cut down on a meal size.- my friends had pad thai and Kway teow mee, which were poorly done. \u00a0Not enough \"wok hay\" - a cooking technique using a smoking hot wok, which 100% affects the way food tastes. \u00a0lucidmike78.blogspot.co.\u2026Again, if you haven't had this type of food before, it may seem great - but while the atmosphere and vibe here is nice, go somewhere else for authentic food.",

    "text": "What a lovely new Soho find.Banana Tree offers Busaba Eathai food at Wagamama prices. \u00a0The offerings aren't terribly original, but it's freshly produced and tastes delicious, plus portion sizes are just right (they look small, but they're packed with meat and lovely rich sauces, leaving you just full enough to make it through the afternoon without falling asleep). \u00a0Plus by serving side salads on a banana leaf, they ensure it looks beautiful.In fact the food presentation contrasts rather too well with the spartan interior. \u00a0It's all exposed pipes, brick walls, concrete benches; that old chestnut. We've seen it before. (Perhaps at Wagamama's). \u00a0I suppose it helps to focus our attention on the lovely edibles but nonetheless it just doesn't feel as welcoming as Busaba Eathai. \u00a0It's tough not to compare the two when the food on offer is so similar; but in terms of atmosphere, Busaba wins hands down. Banana Tree is certainly more practical (there is actually space between the tables for a pushchair or somebody on crutches; you can see what you're eating; you don't fear that if a fire were to break out, you'd be burnt to a crisp before getting half way across the insanely crowded room), and you can't fault the quality of the food, but it does lack that certain je ne sais quois.On the other hand, this means that you can actually get in and out during your lunch break, which is a bonus. I suspect it won't be the case for long, though; as with most Soho eateries, within a month they'll either be packing up and moving on or have patrons queuing for half a mile down Wardour St. \u00a0We're a tough crowd, but by god are we loyal.",

We waited over an hour for our meal, which they forgot to tell the kitchen about. When it arrived, the laksa was mostly water and powder - did they run out of noodles or is that just the way they limit portions to the extreme? After that, the bill arrived and the waiter offered us 25% as a gesture to how abysmal the entire experience had been. The manager stepped in to give us 50% after acknowledging that we waited over an hour, and also another 30 minutes to even get the bill. Two hours spent in this place is two hours wasted. Don't bother going here unless every single restaurant is closed in Soho. Opt for next door's Busaba Eathai, Vapiano or Hummus Brothers.",

Spilling my drink, I kicked and thrust around.Ok maybe I didn't but I did think about it.The manager apologised, put in a new order but as you can imagine that ruined the meal even further as one of us was left hungry and had to wait while the other devoured their meal.Sad times.",

    "text": "Banana Tree is one of those asian/pan european restaurants. When it's done well, you appreciate the twist on classics and staples you've tried in those countries. Where it's done badly, it's just insulting, bordering on embarassing. At one of these type chains in Germany when I complained that a dish I'd had a milllion times was a little salty, I was told this is how it's supposed to taste!Gladly Banana Tree falls into the former category. That said, it's not perfect and there are a few areas it could improve.The interior is great. Spacious, airy, warm and you can see the food being prepped in the kitchen. Great. Service is brisk and polite, if a little stilted.Whenever I go to restaurants like banana tree or giraffe, I like to order things I'm familiar with to compare the quality of the dish. I picked the Thai Tamarind and Garlic Wings along with the double cooked crispy pork mix. These were great. New flavours and concepts for me. The double cooked crispy pork in particular crispy, but still moist inside. There were a few duds however that had obviously been over-fried which we had to leave unfortunately (I think this is the dish that gave me a sore throat afterward!) The achar pickle a little milder than you'd get in an asian household, but tasted great.For the mains, Chicken curry laksa and Kway Teow Mee. The curry laksa was great, lots of ingredients and the chef did make it extra spicy as we'd requested. The Kway Teow Mee however was lacking. The trick with that dish is to have a very high heat in order to char the noodles. This they got half way right. But the noodles should have been flat rice noodles instead of the standard rice noodles they used. Texture is everything.Additionally the Vietnamese coffee we ordered was WAY too sweet. Too much condensed milk and not enough coffee.We were way stuffed after those 2 courses which is a good thing. You won't go hungry on the portions here. However there is just a little work needed on the food to really elevate this place to 5 stars. Everything else from atmosphere, staff and interior is there. One last thing. There is a wifi point called banana tree at the branch, but it's locked and I was told this was for staff use only. That's annoying. If it's for staff only, call it something else. Wifi access is close becoming something every good business should have as standard. If only to upload my photos to Yelp or Instagram asap!",

The menu was clear, had a lot of options, and had fairly reasonable prices for a Soho joint.I had the chicken pho, my first since going gluten-free, and the chicken was beautifully juicy and tender, which is always a good sign, and the combo option with the curry that my other half had, was also fantastic, and it was all out rather quickly and was presented beautifully (I was too busy to get a picture).My only real issue was the service: within a minute of sitting down, we were asked if we wanted drinks, having barely even looked at the menu, and then again by a different waiter about 30 seconds later, at which point I almost felt like leaving because of how pushy they were. A third waiter appeared about two minutes later to ask us if we were okay with the menu, once we'd made a decision, and then got confused about our cocktail order. I think it was a fourth waiter that took our order. Later, when we wanted the bill, it took 15 minutes to be able to ask anybody to send us the cheque, so it went from pushy fast to painfully slow. The cocktails were a little disappointing (we had two types, one being a Long Island), but it being an Asian fusion restaurant and not a cocktail bar, it was brilliant enough they even had cocktails, especially as the happy hour seems to run all day!Despite this, I would definitely return, just due to the fact that the allergen info was so clear, and the food so tasty, so don't let that put you off!",

I came here with friends and we tried different things on the menu from starters to main dishes. I really like the ying yang laksa and it comes with a thick and mild spicy broth in coconut milk. It has all the nice herbs including coriander and basil that add up the taste. You can also choose from chicken, meatballs or prawns. I had a bowl of large laksa when it was raining outside so it was perfect.My friends and I shared a couple of starter plates. We had the fried dough that comes with tasty peanut sauce, chicken wings which were well marinated with sweet and sour sauce with basil, and fried Vietnamese spring rolls with sweet ginger dip sauce. Everything was so gooddd. And then I tried some of my friends' dishes like the tamarind fish. They offer you a combo pack, which basically let you have jasmine rice, glass noodles, crispy prawn crackers, and friend meatballs by adding \u00a33.50. It's a good combination and good deal for a big meal. Services were good too and you can tell that this place is popular and it gets really busy at lunch time.",

The rice they offer amongst the sides it's really good and the food in general it's decent. This place does not accept reservations so you might be in for a wait if you show up in weekend during peak times. One thing that might affect negatively your experience at Banana Tree is the sometimes excessive level of noise: my god this place is noisy. Also being a small please doesn't help either, sometimes it's hard to hear even your dinner mates at your table for how noisy this place is. But I guess that the nice food and the quick service make up for it. Just if you are looking for a relaxing and intimate atmosphere this is not what you are looking for.",

Drink: I only ordered a soft drink, but it was flat. Service: I have been to banana tree several times and each time the place has been understaffed and the staff are often overworked - resulting in forgotten orders or lack of service. Atmosphere: The ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and nice.

The offer was 2-4-1 on starters and mains AND happy hour cocktails... Happy days! I had heard good things about Banana Tree so I was happy to head there and check it out! The restaurant is huge with plenty of table and bar seating. I was annoyingly sat next to these winder leaver things which kept prodding into me so I wouldn't say I was comfortable throughout the evening.We ordered two Woo Woo's which, of course, turned into four. They were fresh tasting but there wasn't much alcohol in there and they went down a little too quickly, mainly because they were filled with ice. I then opted for the steamed chicken dumplings in a fresh herb and garlic sauce - they were served in a bowl and covered in the sauce. I have to say they were pretty good but if I wouldn't have been a big fan of the sauce then they would have been difficult to eat but luckily for me it was YUMMY. Next, I had their recommended Banana Tree Laksa with king prawns - rice noodles topped with a spiced coconut broth, with aubergine & bean sprouts. It was definitely hot. You could really taste the spice in the broth but it was good. There were plenty of prawns and SO MANY noodles. The bowl was huge and no matter how much I ate it just didn't seem to go down. I ended up leaving half of it which is never a bad thing I guess. I did enjoy it and would definitely have it again! Our waitress was friendly but we had to have the bill amended in line with the Taste Card even though we'd mentioned it twice and when actually asking for the bill.Overall our experience was good, it was just a shame about the few irritants but I would go again for a cheapish and satisfying meal if needed.",

Anyhoo, I ordered the grilled chicken with fragrant rice. It had a much more exotic name than that but I'll be damned if I can recall it! I also ordered their sticky tamarind chicken wings..oh yes it was a chicken fiesta baby! So the wings were very tasty in my books! Could've had a little more of a crisp to them but flavour wise it was on point! Now as for my main course.... Drum roll..... Disappointing It looked a lot better than the taste .. It was so lightly seasoned I wasn't sure the chicken was even dead! The rice was yellow just for the fun of it because there was nothing fragrant about it really... Ahhhhh would I go back? Nahhh but it hit the spot at the time so I should be grateful right haha",

    "text": "Banana Tree is in an awesome area surrounded by lots of shops and other restaurants so it was a nice treat to walk past. The menu looked exciting but upon walking in, there was a stale smell and it was not full compared to other restaurants nearby. Nonetheless, I was craving some fragrant and strong flavours and Banana Tree is an IndoChinese restaurant guaranteed to provide those flavours! They have some nice starters, soups, curries, salads, meats with salad and some cool drinks. We ordered the Duck Spring Rolls and it was recommended we wrap them in lettuce, mint, coriander, some pickled carrots and dip it in a spicy sauce (Recommended as in they put a little card on our plate to tell us how to eat it- Bit random). It sounds all very exciting but I preferred it separately. The pickled carrots were awesome! We also ordered steamed chicken dumplings which were awesome!! For mains I had the Laksa soup - IT WAS MASSIVE!!! For only \u00a310.95 I believe! But it is extremely rich. It's a pretty relaxed vibe and the waiters/waitresses are all pretty chilled too. Super affordable and nice if you want a spicy dish or a big variety.",

    "text": "After eating English style fish and chips mostly during my vacation in London. My sister and I were craving some good Asian cuisine. Bad itinerary planning on my part, (went to London, then went to Paris then went back to London lol I just wanted to make my sister more adventurously tired) our train arrived to London from Paris in the evening for the last 2 days of our trip. \u00a0By the time we put our luggage away and did some \u00a0shopping near the oxford and regent street it was dinner time. We walked/ or took the train towards the west side of London. I was so tired that night not sure how we ended up in soho, London. Very lively place with bars and contemporary restaurants. And I wasn't sure why they had so many sex related stores etc. Later, I researched about it and discovered soho was one naughty place up to 1980s. The point is we found an amazing Asian restaurant called Banana Tree. They have 6 locations in U.K. Only have been to this location and it was very no fuss hip sort of restaurant with regular seating as well as communal seating.We ordered two mocktails (yummy/yummy) from their extensive mocktails/juice list. The appetizer noodle soup we ordered was amazing with a delicious curry flavor to it. We ordered two noodle dishes as well and they were unique and tasteful. The service was quick and efficient and I liked the casual date night atmosphere. If your in London go to one of their locations for sure (this one is for you Ash and your upcoming trip to Europe)",
