    "text": "Ping Pong was my first exposure to dim sum and I was absolutely blown away. The Northern Chinese dumplings were like nothing I had ever experienced at American Chinese restaurants, where greasy meat and vegetables slopped on top of greasy rice is the standard. I ordered a delicious apple iced tea to start off my meal, followed by a bowl of the coriander hot and sour soup which was packed with flavor. We ordered a wide variety of dumplings that we all shared and sampled, and they were all wonderful. My favorite were the spicy vegetable dumplings, which contained vegetables, rice vermicelli, chili, and garlic. Yum yum yum! Everything was absolutely delicious. Another plus came from the prices on the menu- Ping Pong was considerably less expensive than a lot of other restaurants in London. The atmosphere was lovely as well- we sat outside on a perfectly temperate summer day and watched people come and go about Marleybone. The server was friendly and enthusiastic, and he was always very quick about offering us refills. Eating at Ping Pong was an absolutely wonderful experience, one that I would recommend to anyone who's looking for a good meal.In short: Ping Pong has good food, good service, and a good atmosphere. What more could you want?",

The decor is simple, with low seating, dim lighting and square glass tables.We all usually go for selection of dim sum, but I would recommend that if you are hungry or have some manly men with you who enjoy a proper feast, opt for a solo meal. The dim sum is wonderful though, particularly the spicy meat options (there are a number of different types) and the cocktail list is quite extensive. The lavender herbal teas are interesting as come in a glass and as you drink, the leaves expand - the innocent tea became quite the talking point of our table!It does get expensive however as it is easy to get carried away with the ordering so I would recommend you make firm decisions at the start of the meal as to how much you want. Definitely a winner for me though as the place is relaxing, fun and a sociable way to have a meal with friends.",

The whole chain is all 'cocktail Chinese food' - it's set to quite modern, slightly westernized design and most the clientele are usually local office workers with a smattering of tourist. The colours are much darker and atmospheric than a traditional Chinese restaurant and the menu reflects this in it's more minimalist edge. I think your best bet is to share a few dishes between the people you're eating with as most of the dim sum is typically small and bite size so you can easily mix and match. Prices aren't extortionate but again more than you'd pay in a more just off Chinatown sort of location. Try the jasmine tea after, they serve it so that the plant sort of flower's as you drink it. Give it a go.",

    "text": "This restaurant was the perfect place to lose my Dim Sum virginity oh so many years ago and it most certainly left me coming back for more. As a naive young waif back in my first year of university, coming to the big city from a humble country home, I'd never heard of Dim Sum. I remember the evening well, a group of friends (cosmopolitan Londoners) were going for dinner and I couldn't say no. Apprehensive at first, soon all fears were dashed. Ping Pong was the perfect setting, with the wine flowing I began to feel relaxed and comfortable, there was no pressure, I could take my time and say no if it all got to much. Oh how times have changed. Long gone are they days when the mention of a Char Sui bun caused me to break into a sweat, I now need to make regular visits to Ping Pong, I may go as far to say I'm a Dim Sum hussy! Ping Pong can accommodate many a social situation. Be it a working lunch, a flying visit, a meal with friends and family, a date. It suits all. This specific restaurant (there are 11 throughout London) is over 2 floors, ground and basement. The ground floor is alot more fast paced than downstairs. It is dominated by a large round table in the middle which is perfect if you manage to be seated on it but for the other surrounding tables, they are more than a little crampt. In a restaurant where a meal may consist of 6 plates one would hope to have more room that of a TV dinner tray, but ho hum, people that sit here are generally on lunch breaks or in meetings and don't have time to sit around. It works well if you want a fast paced lunch with out feeling like your under pressure to leave. If a more leisurely, relaxed experience is what you are after then I urge you to request a seat downstairs. Although I will take this opportunity to issue a warning, down in the basement area, there are no windows, its cosy and quiet and more than easy to lose yourself in a Lychee Martini or 4 and suddenly forget that you are in central London and have to contend with half of Oxford Street whilst in an alcohol induced daze. However the Lychee Martinis are fabulous and you have been warned! So, on to the food. It's all amazing. I have never had a bad eating experience there. Anything steamed melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more, I tend to avoid the baked puffs, not that they're bad but more pastry than filling does not a happy Hannah make. The Char Sui bun has the same affect, it is nice but sometimes I feel like I'm eating a cloud to find a little bit of pork. On the other end of the scale the Crispy Prawn Ball is amazing. Once one has worked out how to devour such a peculiar looking entity, it's all good. The squid in Satay sauce is so so good, as are the honey glazed ribs. The cocktail list is extensive and brilliant, I find them expensive but then I find every cocktail in London expensive, they are much the same price as anywhere else. The teas are equally exciting. Cheap and they put on a show, what more could you want, a flower emerging from a ball certainly makes me smile, maybe I'm just easily pleased. Still go and try it and see if it has the same effect! Each dish varies from about \u00c2\u00a32 to \u00c2\u00a34 so depending on how much of a pig you are and how much you like your booze it can work out very cheap. Personally, I am a pig and I like a tipple, for 2 of us the bill is usually \u00c2\u00a330. So, whether your a Dim Sum virgin or know your Har Gau from your Shu Mai, go and check this place out, it's a keeper!",

We have Chinatown and of course now the trend is huge with various pop ups, restaurants and food stalls in 2016, but Ping Pong was actually one of the first on the scene. It was also my first proper introduction.The first time I went I thought it was amazing. Maybe it still is in that same branch by Carnaby St. Here this branch and I've been to many it was like all the others thought I can't help feel more savvy about what dumplings or dim sum should be. Maybe I've become more in tune with what to look for...a non thick outer casing. The fried dumplings are nice, but the star is the prawn steamed dumplings. It's only this I really like anymore. It's a franchise place now but I can't help but feel they haven't progressed as a brand, especially with their menu. Not to say it's bad at all.To me it represents a quick fun eating experience with friends or partner. Somewhere with very good cocktails and depending on your branch a nice layout. But it doesn't set any benchmark for dim sum. The quality is ok and that's what you get for a reasonable price.",

We had to wait a few minutes to be seated since it was packed. We had to sit downstairs. It was a little tight space, I'm not sure how they were able to bring all our food without hitting anyone. Anyways, there was a menu that you pick out the food you want so we did that since we were unsure of how this whole process works. Dim sum was amazing, the drinks were amazing. I wish I went back here when I was in London recently. They should have places like this in the states. I will try the set menu next time I\"m back in London.",

The potato and edamame cakes are... hnnnngh.My only disappointment is that the rice dish that they used to serve with this was a beautiful chicken and broccoli dish and now it's mushroom and vegetables.

    "text": "Sometimes I just need some Dim Sum. There is something rather special about the little balls of sweet and sour filled joy (buns) coming in piping hot thatched wooden gazebo box. Dumpling of various varieties and sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves. It's the perfect thing to share with a group and this is just what we did. 11 of us at a large round table made it a great atmosphere to \"pass that yum thing\" around. I was a little dismayed by the prices, though for London, I guess I shouldn't have been too shocked! The menu is pretty big with lots of choices for everyone. I wasn't particularly hungry after a huge lunch so went for the lighter options. I actually was in the mood for veggie things and found a great deal to choose from. I personally ordered the vegetable dumpling soup which came with a gorgeous broth which was warm but not overpowering. Perfect appetizer. I had the vegetarian sticky rice which came all wrapped up. I had some of the chicken dumplings which were tiny parcels of joy and went great with the sauce. I pinched a bit of the little lamb chops off the table which were succulent and gave just enough tug when you tried to rip it off the bone. Also, the beer deal was pretty legit as we got a bucket (yes, a bucket) of 10 beers for like 29 pounds? Next time I go, I am definitely going to pig out on the 29 pound set menu. No contest.",

There is no better place to go than Ping Pong and have some of their winter warmer lunch. It was one of those places I wanted to go to for a long time. My hubby is not a big fun of dim sum, so I thought that lunch would be a great option. We both chose Winter Warmer lunch - regular and vegetarian option. It comes with 6 or 7 dim sums, rice dish with broccoli, mushrooms and chicken (in regular option), 2 sauces and a tea of choice. I had some lovely jasmine lily green tea. It was a great deal and the food was delicious. It was just what we needed at that moment. It filled us up and brought some strength to face the cold again.",

Shame Shame shame...This one seems small when you enter, with little tables very close together, but fear not! There's more seating downstairs if it's looking busy. We had a table Next to the most hilarious couple of men I've ever eavesdropped on (not hard - you are very close together) but if I wasn't enjoying their conversation so much, it could of been annoying.We chose a few dishes to share and I would greedily say - about 6-7 should fill you up.We had a gorgeous chicken soup - delicate flavours but still managed to feel wholesome. Then shared a pork bun - so different to anything I've had before but I loved it! We then went on to munch our way through the dim sum menu - mostly steamed. All very tasty. Drinks were quite expensive and annoyingly I had a lovely glass of Malbec and could have quite easily enjoyed another if it wasn't the best part of \u00a38! Not too cheap but thoroughly enjoyed it.Brightonians - the nearest thing we've got to Ping Pong down here is Yum Yum Ninja I believe!",

The other one with the pixie cut and black glasses laughed at us when we didn't know that we had to order on a piece of paper. But they didn't even explain that to us So how we're we even supposed to know. So rude. They didn't even welcome us. Also, she was so nice to the customers next to us. I guess She was looking down on us because we were asian I guess and that we can't understand, but jokes on her we came from California. Also even when we werent even done with our food, they were taking our food away. Not only is the service bad, the food is not good. We ate the Roast Pork Puff and it was 4.55 pounds. It was only 3 pieces !! It was not even that good. It is just beef inside a puff pastry. The only thing that was good despite the price was crispy prawn ball which was 5.35 pounds which only has 3 pieces.... The bathroom was so nasty and I feel like they don't clean the bathroom at all !! Overall not a good place. We were a family of 4 and the overall the bill was 28 pounds and we were still so hungry. \u00a0Please dont come here. It was a disappointment... P.s. I'm a student in California who came for vacation. Also, I had a B plus in English class and am very passionate about food. So please take this in consideration. Thanks !!

If it were at home I would describe it as \"Americanized\" dim-sum so I guess I would call this \"London-ized\" dim sum?? I don't know, you get the point.You order dim-sum on an order sheet. I decided to get the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves and the crispy duck spring rolls. The sticky rice was underwhelming, I wasn't a fan of the filling. The duck spring rolls were better than the sticky rice. My big thing was I felt like the prices for the portion sizes and quality were just not good. My two things equalled about 12 pounds including service charge which is a rip off for the food quantity and quality. Service was also SUPER slow. It took us about 10 minutes of sitting there to even get greeted. Definitely not a fan of this restaurant.",

    "text": "***Part II of above review***...I should've known that the food here was going to suck when I asked our server for a spoon and he looked baffled at my request. Has this man ever eaten soup dumplings in his life, probably not. Considering the only soup based dumpling on the menu is the xiao long bao, any competent server would know that you can't consume it without burning ones mouth in a deliciously steaming broth that explodes with one bite. I digress...we finish the crappy food we ordered and figured since it's \"Lazy Sunday\", we might as well order more food as we intend to take advantage of mediocre all you can eat fusion dim sum. \"Wow you finished those fast!\", Alberto States. He rushingly takes away our plates. Cool, we think. Let's order more, but there's one problem, he took away the pen we used to self mark the menu with the items we wanted. Hell come back we think to ourselves. 5 mins pass. Water glass is now empty. 10 mins pass, still no sign of Alberto. 35 minutes pass: Alberto is seen taking orders from our neighbors, bussing tables, cleaning tables with what appears to be blue windex, and touching food right after. Cross contamination? I hope homeboy washed his hand.In every instance of coming near us, Alberto would rush by us--seemingly to avoid eye contact with us despite us glaring at him. Everytime the man walked by, he stared at his shoe. Reminiscent of my teenage self when I walked by a girl, I thought was attractive. As it approaches the 35 minute walk, we say f*** it, let's just get the check. The total is $47 GBP (would be $50 GBP if they charged us for their Lazy Sunday Special). Another 10 minutes pass and no one seems to even notice we are here. My brother goes up the front to politely ask for the check. Alberto returns with his portable card reader. No longer a confident man who took our initial order. He seemed overworked and tired and did not even bother to ask us about our meal or engage in any meaningful conservation. \u00a0All he does is attempt to perform basic math aloud to spilt our bill. A 12.5 percent \"optional\" service fee is added to our bill. Did this man deserve his tip, no; but who in their right mind would defy to pay it. Anyways the travesty of their \"Lazy Sunday\" all you can eat switch and bait lunch is over with. I head to the cloakroom to wash my hands. Great it's locked. 5 minutes pass by, I hear a flush and boom...another server exits the bathroom. The look in eye is of disgust. FML this dude just took a massive dump...the remnants of his stool is still in the bathroom. I hold my breath for dear life as it smells like he ate a dead person. Hands washed...I ran out of that bathroom as fast as I could. This place sucks, I think to myself. TLDR: if you want authentic dim sum, skip this place and head to china town. I'm sure any lowly rated place over there is better than this place. Don't trust TripAdvisor...1000+ 4 star average reviews probably written by people who never had dim sum in their life. Make me an Yelp Elite already. My reviews are fire. Peace. Use Yelp in UK my friends.",

    "text": "Ping Pong is my love. It's a chain, but I don't care. Who cares if it's delicious and healthy? I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I've picked up the take away. That's a pretty good sign though right, because they've packaged it up, and I have to take it home, unpack it, and it's still phenomenal? Yes I think it's a good sign. Anyway, my husband and I like ordering a bunch of dim sum from their menu and just sharing it. The black prawn dumpling is by far the best dumpling ever ever ever. Holy gazolie it's incredible. We also like the mushroom and scallop, veggie, edamame. Really, they're all very good. I also like their soup- thai style mushroom soup- it's very strong with lemongrass but it's really nice. And their rice pot- tofu, mushroom, and black bean rice pot- it's quite big and delicious. Yay Ping Pong. It's got a lot of variety, and yummy, healthy vegetarian/vegan food. Yum. A great option if you're in a hurry but want something that is warm and not terrible for you.",

As well as very very slow even though it wasn't very busy the waitress was a bit rude - blunt and dismissive. Stillll as always I can recommend the char Sui bun, roast pork puffs and the yuzu matcha cake. Personally think the spinach and beef dumpling is very bland but also enjoyed the potato edamame cake and the veal spring rolls. The special dumplings - 3 different colours - were ok but nothing special. Tasty food but not the usual service",
