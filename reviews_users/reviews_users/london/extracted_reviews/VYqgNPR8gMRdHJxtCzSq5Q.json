Dwarfed by the monstrous Winter Wonderland, The Serpentine Bar & Kitchen comes as a nice surprise and peaceful retreat.I was extremely busy and I can't wait to come back on a regular weekend once the fun fair is gone.Excellent choice of cakes and pastries, but the pizzas looked and smelled good, too.All \"stations\" seem to have their own queuing and payment system which seems a bit confusing, but in the end the waiting time was OK and we even managed to find a space at a table (far too cold to braze outdoor seating).This is the latest addition to Benugo's growing domination of public spaces. Or is it just me, they seem to be popping up everywhere.",

    "text": "My friend and I met for brunch in Hyde Park at the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen (serpentinebarandkitchen.\u2026) . It's such a lovely setting and despite walking by so many times I'd never actually gone in before. We arrived just before 11am which was a good time as the place was already quite busy. I spotted a newly-vacant table by the window and went to nab it but someone else was there quicker and played the 'we've got a pram so it's easier to sit here' card, which I didn't really get to be honest \u00a0there was just as much room at the previous table, but away we went defeated. There was still room further back and we sat at a small table, furnished with condiments. Although the kitchen is not visible it's still open above the small partition they've put in front which means you do get a lovely whiff of grub when you're waiting to eat perhaps a tactic to up-sell coffees to brunches. You do have to go and order for yourself and at the prices they charge it seems a little much, service would be nicer. However, we ordered myself the eggs Florentine and my friend opted for the same without sauce or spinach (no discount for just wanting a buttered muffin and eggs I might add). The food was really nice. The eggs are creamy duck eggs and the Hollandaise was delicious (although I tried not to have too much as I was watching the calories). The tea was yummy and I got about three cups from my teapot but we did have to pay 40p for the hot water (really?!). See the breakfast menu here (serpentinebarandkitchen.\u2026) . All in all it's a lovely setting but gets very busy with families so it's not the best location for an intimate chat. We teamed our brunch with a walk around the Serpentine in the brisk January cold, burning off some of it we hoped. I'd go again for a treat, but perhaps just for a drink. At \u00a39 without drinks, my breakfast was a little bit of a treat but won't become a regular expenditure.",

My friends and I went with the personal pizzas which ranged from around 8 to 12 pounds. \u00a0Fortunately, we realized that the pizzas were pretty large for just one person and ended up splitting them to save some money. \u00a0Like the previous review, I agree that the drinks were overpriced: sodas, wines, and beers.I give the Serpentine, three stars though because of the atmosphere. \u00a0The restaurant has a great view of the lake and park. \u00a0Inside, the different chairs are covered in pillows, center around a fireplace, and there is outdoor seating.Though one trip to the tourist trap is enough, if you happen to be in the park and want some lunch go for it.",

    "text": "The restaurant next to the Serpentine lake and river in Hyde Park has just reopened (April 09) and is already an amazing success, just by looking at the long queues of customers waiting to order their food and drinks. The place has been totally redesigned with strong inspiration from gastro-pub food and decor with a fantastic view on the lake. There is both a large restaurant with large open windows that bring plenty of light and a large terrasse under the trees perfect for a sunny day (there are some) in the Park. It is huge (300 seats including outdoor) but doesnt feel so huge). The menu changes for breakfast (8-12am), lunch (12-3) and dinner (5-8pm). We had breakfast there with a choice of classic eggs, bacon, sausages etc. plus pancakes, croissant, muffins, basically everything one expect from a UK/US style breakfast. Food is served quite fast (once you have managed to order) on the nice wooden tables inside the restaurant. There is also an area to seat down and read in comfie chairs, with darker walls and pictures hanging on the walls, cool contrast with the rest. I uploaded a pix of the kitchen. The BIG drawback is that the food ordering system is so badly organised that it almost spoiled our breakfast but I am sure it drove many meny people mad. There is basically no clear signage of how to queue at the bar and staff is totally lost leading to very long queues forming very fast. Super frustrating, the managers must know about this and I hope their process will be redesigned soon. Until they sort this out it will remain a 3-star place but this has clear 5-star potential once this is sorted, it should be great at any time, from early breakfasts to an early dinner facing the beautiful sunset one can catch from that place. Note that this is very child friendly.",

It's in the middle of Hyde park so there isn't the noise of cars and we came early so it was quite peaceful and quiet.We arrived around 11:30am and it was fairly empty. Only a bunch of moms with prams and their kids. We sat outside and wanted to order breakfast. (Their menu says breakfast served until 12p, last call 11:30a). We were then told we were too late for breakfast. It was exactly 11:30a on my watch. All we wanted were salmon and eggs and we were told we were too late! \u00a0After a lot of debate, we were finally allowed to order from the breakfast menu.Then, another one of our party wanted to order from the lunch menu. It was 11.45a and the bar (where you pay) said I had to wait until 12p to order! \u00a0I said why can't you just take my order and give me the food when the kitchen re-opens? (What an inefficient kitchen that takes so long to transition from Bfast to Lunch!) they said they can't even take my order because that's what the chef says. It wasn't even a limitation on their systems, they just simply wouldn't take the lunch order before 12p! \u00a0Unreal, especially with a queue forming behind me. I'm a Yank but have been here for 8.5 years so I've learned to be patient about British inefficiencies but this is nuts. Especially on a sunny summer weekend! \u00a0Just take the order and I'll be happy to wait! \u00a0Needless to say I wasn't the only one shocked at this. There were a few behind me pretty irritated about this \"policy\" as well. FYI there is no wifi here as well. If I come back here I'll make sure to come well before the transition time. The food is ok, wouldn't say it's the best, but the views are nice and it's a calming environment if you head over before the rush!",

It was a rainy day in Hyde park, and so the restaurant was not very busy at all. My husband and I sat and looked through the menu, decided on the veggie pizza. He went up to order while I enjoyed the views. As soon as my husband got up, a very rude worker came up to me and stated rudely.\"You can't just sit here, you have to be eating.\" I looked up and said\"I am going to be eating.\"The worker demanded to me \"let me see your receipt.\"To which I responded, \"I don't have one yet, my husband is in line ordering right now\". And I pointed to my husband in line. She glared at me and thought a moment and she said \"what is he ordering?\"I was really taken aback and irritated. I asked her \"Does it matter? Do you need me to go get him to prove he's in line and we are ordering food?\"She said \"I just need to know what your ordering\"\"Pizza\". I said. She made an irritated noise and walked away.I watched this worker the rest of the time I was there and she did not approach any other table or person to question them the way she questioned me.While I realize people probably go in there often and have no plans to order and are trying to rest or enjoy the view-- I think there are better and less rude ways to police this. I got up to leave because I don't need to give business to a place that treats people so rudely, but my husband had finished ordering.Our pizza came out and it was quite delicious. Despite the food being great and the view unforgettable, the way I was treated is not acceptable and we will not be back.",

It has the perfect ingredient to have a great time - Located in the center of lush green Hyde Park, brilliant outdoor seating area by the serpentine river, the most beautiful place to sit and watch the sun set, great pizza, Pimms Pitchers and great crowd! I mean what else can one possibly ask for from a restaurant? I have been here on several occasions and also hosted my birthday party here last year and it is always a pleasure coming back here. In my last visit yesterday when the sun finally decided to shine on London after a long wait, Serpentine was packed and yet the service was so fast and the spicy pepperoni pizza couldn't taste any better along with my Pimm's Pitcher! The price is very decent for its location and quality, I mean come on its Hyde Park are you expecting brick lane price here?Verdict: I am in love with this place and will continue to be till it stands tall and beautiful in the middle of Hyde Park!

I went went it was want out and took time to cool down so not sure how comfortable it will be when the temperature gets really warm. So be warned.

They will give you first the drinks and later the waiter will deliver all main courses directly tenuous table",

(Also, for some reason a flat white is cheaper than an Americano, despite the extra work that goes into it)They've an ill-though-out queueing system so they've got to tell everyone where to queue; this overworks the service folk so much they can't offer good service, and this results as at best mediocre food and service. Also, all too often, cold coffee. Misheard orders. I hear the cakes are nice, though. And they do have the bit where you can sit and look at the Serpentine.",

    "text": "Serpentine Bar & Kitchen is located in the heart of the beautiful Hyde Park right next to the lake. The view from the restaurant, especially from the large terrace area, is quite heavenly. An oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of hectic London. And even though the restaurant can get pretty crowded and loud, the atmosphere is quite nice and there are plenty of tables. Outside seating is definitely the way to go if it's not too cold. The menu consists of pretty basic pub food, but they put up daily specials which is great! I had the soup of the day, which was a potato and broccoli soup. It wasn't anything to rave about to be honest, it was just ok. What was a big negative thought was the fact that the soup was brought to me absolutely scolding hot and it was literally impossible to eat for at least 15 minutes... The wait staff was super fast and efficient but a bit rude. As a conclusion I would give the food and service 3 stars but the location is 5 stars - therefore my review is a 4.",

We kept it simple and had burgers and pizzas and they were lovely.

Naturally we got hungry after a while and this place was closest to us.Location couldn't be better, with great views of The Serpentine (at least outside). There is a good number of seats outside and a lot more inside. We travelled with our dog, so an outdoor seat was our choice (no dogs inside - but why sit inside anyways).It was really packed and no seats availabe. The waitrees helped us looking for table, which was nice. We kept looking when she came back after a while pointing us to an available table. That was really nice, especially given how busy it was that day. Kudos to the staff!We ordered a pint, a summer berries cider and a Rucola / Prosciutto Pizza. Service again was friendly and pretty fast too.Drinks were nice and cold and - for London - fairly priced. The Pizza was a good choice, good flavours and fresh ingredients. Nice twist with the Rucola on top. We didn't expect much from this Restaurant. But we were positively surprised by the really nice staff and the food quality.",

I got to try the breakfast beans. Also there was a really cute set up of pastries that you can pick from on your own before you go to pay. I definitely took advantage of the fact it was over looking a lovely pond with geese and swans.",

    "text": "On the eve of Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday, I found myself enjoying a romantic second date in the picturesque, centuries old, Hyde Park. After my barrel-o-laughs Brazilian beau and I spent a good amount of time soaking up vitamin D from an uncharacteristically sunny day, we set out on an excursion to diffuse our hunger pains. Tucked away in the rolling green hillside was none other than Serpentine Bar and Kitchen. Instantly familiar with the site, my guy informed me that he'd once visited Serpentine with his mom. Nearly faint from starvation, we decided to dine in. I was initially impressed with the overall structure of the building. The inconspicuous architectural design, which almost appears to have been chiseled from the lakeside by process of mechanical erosion, can best be described as an aesthetically pleasing contemporary chameleon. Spacious enough to accommodate hundreds of visitors, Serpentine offers 360 degree views of Hyde Park for indoor diners. Lunch al fresco immerses guests in a sea of bluebells, as well as a variety of trademark British foliage and landscapes.After placing our orders, my guy and I waited for our server at table number 3. (Tables are numbered, which reduces confusion for patrons and staff alike) I was satisfied with my choice of thin crust vegetable pizza with rosemary fries. I went out on a limb and decided to wash everything down with my very first ginger beer. While recovering from Fentimans unrelenting roundhouse kick, I sat and enjoyed my beau savour every morsel of his open faced steak sandwich and more than a few of my rosemary fries. Overall, Id highly recommend a meal at Serpentine to anyone who finds themselves in Hyde park in the near or distant future.",

While I would recommend grabbing some drinks or coffee with friends or by yourself to enjoy the beautiful scenery in this restaurant patio, I would not recommend getting a full meal here. It's simply not worth the high price even by London standard.",

And yes, now you know why all those poets went crazy writing their ode to this place...!Coming back to Serpentine Bar and Kitchen - you order at the counter, they give you a token and get your food to the table. It's all pretty much self service & easy.",

We recently popped in on a cold crisp and sunny day and brave the outdoor benches to watch the sun go down. Needless to say we needed our coffees (again I got a mocha which was good) and shared a slice of carrot cake which was really good. Moist, good flavour, good amount of cream cheese icing but a little burnt at the very bottom.",
