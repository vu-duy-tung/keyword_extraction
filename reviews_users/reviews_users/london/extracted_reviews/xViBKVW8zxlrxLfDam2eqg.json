It's neither, and definitely worth checking out, even if you're not sightseeing.The interior is rustic and bright. The service is just serviceable, but that's fine, given the casual air of the whole place. The English breakfast and its veggie counterpart are big and satisfying and, amazingly, relatively inexpensive.",

Does that simply because I asked for the early bird rate which is on their website and apparently he is not happy with?! In the middle of the wait, approx 20 mins, we asked him when we can have our food and he said I will bring it for you. Then he went back to serve other guests and didn't even look at us even when we purposely and constantly giving him the eye contacts. After 35-40 mins wait, we asked another waiter about our food and he immediately went back to the kitchen and checked for the order. Guess what? The first guy didn't put the order, obviously. Then two waiters had some chats and the first waiter didn't say anything or show any surprise to him, nor he showed any apologies to us. He seems careless. I came to London from the US but I believe this stupid waiter thought that I am some random Chinese/ Japanese girl who cannot speak English and doesn't understand Western culture or something. It was the most ridiculous dinning experience ever and I don't recommend anyone who wants a good service come here to eat. You will get mistreated by a racist.",

We both had ham, eggs and chips \u00a37.5 and cappuccinos \u00a32.3. Sweet staff. One server clued us in to the fact that just through a nearby doorway, we could enter/view the oldest church in England. We checked it out before heading to the Tower. Very busy place.

The menu includes homemade cakes (delicious) as well as more substantial dishes, but I've always stuck with the tea and cakes, to be honest.Although it does get busy, it never feels stressful, the staff are great, and it is sometimes a shock to walk out and realise you are still in the heart of the City, next door to one of London's busiest tourist attractions. Speaking of which, the prices at Kitchen are pretty reasonable, much more so than in the Tower of London, so I'd definitely recommend stopping here if you are visiting the castle.The cafe is also built on to the All Hallows by the Tower church, which is a fantastic tourist destination in its own right, and worth popping into too: qype.co.uk/place/133146-\u2026",

We came back 3 /5 days we ate breakfast as we stayed at The Tower Hotel. Also it's insanely affordable. Great coffee. Wonderful food.

A quick search on the Yelp app (casual plug there) and I found this place a couple of miles for me. Perfect!Set in a courtyard off a busy London road, this place gets some of the traffic noise but nevertheless aims to be relaxing and a bit quirky - lime green and pink chairs outside for a bit of colour. Obviously a popular place, it had a nice mix of business men On brunch meetings and casual tourist look-a-likes such as my beautiful self. Tea in a 'keep calm and carry on' mug I LOVE, casual crown on top to remind you how close you are to the Tower of London :)I had scrambled eggs on toast with bacon, very brunch I feel. Eggs were lovely, not runny or dry but that nice middle ground. On reflection the bacon wasn't needed but who can resist a free optional extra! Good quality bread, love a seeded loaf. Not 5 stars as it comes with a central London price tag unfortunately (as a northern boy I know I could get that cheaper).All in all, if I worked around here I could definitely see myself coming back on a weekly basis. As it is, now I know where to go if I wake up but dirty dishes again ;)",

The high ceiling and big glass windows/walls allow natural lighting which in turn induce relaxing mood to the occupants; and that indeed was one of the reasons why I like this place. I also adore some of the kitschy/shabby chic decor and the oh so comfortable English wing chairs to settle at after a long day of walk. The leather couch was not too bad either. Sadly, I was disappointed by the food they serve. The taste is mediocre and lacking creativity. Thankfully the service is friendly and cheerful. For example of the servers made us the guests sing happy birthday to one of the young diner celebrating her 25th birthday there. This friendliness is not so common in London in my opinion so I am giving kudos to the Kitchen crew.Overall, the kitchen@tower is adorable and relaxing restaurant/cafe but I'll only recommend it \u00a0for its charm.",

I had the veggie English breakfast, which despite the pseudo oxymoron, was amazing. Eggs, beans on toast, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, hash browns and veggie sausage with coffee for \u00a38.50.I wouldn't go quite so far as to call it a 'hidden gem', but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and desperate for a restaurant that isn't advertised by a gent wearing a giant sign and shouting about chips.",

Service was quick and friendly. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and swapped the chips for a salad without a problem or extra charge. My husband got the fish and chips and our friend got a burger.While my chicken came out bland (at this point it seems to be all the chicken in England is bland...) I will say the toppings were fresh and the roll was DELICIOUS. There's nothing worse than ordering a sandwich and the bread is gross... This was not the case here. I didn't have a taste of the fish nor did I taste the burger, but both looked delicious. My friend who ate the burger said it was tasty, while my husband said the fish was just \"okay.\" Not something I expected at Ochoa first fish and chips meal in England!If you need a quick bite to eat near the tower this place will do. They also have a lovely garden with seating for a nice day.",

    "text": "Walking distance from the Tower of London and directly across the street from the Citizen M that I stayed at, I must say that this place for breakfast was great way to start day. We entered the restaurant around 8:30 am and greeted and immediately seated by our hostess. The first thing that really struck me about this place was the overall ambiance of it. The restaurant itself is situated in a relatively large building but conveys a really warm and cozy atmosphere. The decor was modern and the patio looked beautiful despite the drizzle of rain. Given that this was our first time in the U.K., we knew we had to have the full English breakfast. They also had an interesting list of coffee/speciality drinks/wine/beer selection from the bar. The most tempting and the thing that I regret not ordering was this Irish coffee with a shot Baileys in it. Anyways, the two orders of the full English breakfast comes and man did that thing look bomb. Two rashes of back bacon, a sausage, a perfectly looked sunny side up egg, mushrooms, a hash brown triangle, roast tomato, baked beans, black pudding, and toast. Despite never having tomatoes, beans, and tomatoes for breakfast before, I must say that the flavor profile of each item complimented one another very well. The black pudding, a first, but given that I am asian and have eaten pork blood in my rice congee, was appealing to me and actually pretty good. That sausage and the beans though were definitely the highlight for me. The bacon was almost like Canadian bacon and the only thing that I think that the American breakfast wins at. Overall, everything on that plate was amazing and I wish I could have this every morning here in the states. The only thing that I wish they did differently was to give you two slices of toast. One slice of toast was not sufficient and my brother and I even debated if we should added a croissant prior to ordering. If I knew they gave you one slice of toast, I definitely would added another carb to my order. Highly recommend this place. Another awesome thing about this place was they did not automatically add the 12% service charge to your bill so bring some pounds to tip because they definitely provide excellent service.",

Mango juice is amazing. They did apologize for the service and what not which is always nice. The place itself is cute has a lot of room. I would recommend coming here as I don't believe the service is always that slow",

    "text": "I almost feel bad posting a 2 star review when others have had such inexplicably great experiences! We went on a Tuesday around late noon, the place was still about half full with the lunch crowd. After reading all of the reviews below we had good expectations even though it's kind of a 'tourist trap' restaurant by the Tower.Let's start with our server. He was particularly abysmal. Maybe he'd just given up after dealing with non-tipping tourists day after day. After our food was dropped off we didn't see him again. Literally, he was no where to be found. Nor did anyone else check on us, and we sat for ages before going up to a random counter-staffer to ask for our bill and pay (we saw other people getting bills to their table so we expected this was standard procedure and waited). So no points for service. Let's move on to the food. My friend and I both figured we'd be a little typical and get some good old English fish and chips. The place had good reviews so it'll be good, right? So wrong. Coming from the Atlantic coast of Canada I'm pretty well versed in battered haddock. This fish tasted like pure nothingness. Sooooo so so bland and disappointing. The tartar sauce tasted like your typical grocery store variety and we weren't even offered lemon or vinegar as per standard English custom. Chips (or 'fries' for us Canadian folk) were decent, but with our lack of server we had to get up, do a little sleuth work, and steal a bottle of ketchup from a wayward tray stand instead of getting our waiter to fetch some for us. As I mentioned, our waiter never checked on our meal so we didn't even have the opportunity to voice a complaint.We paid (with no tip, sorry bud!) and left. Coincidentally, there was another Canadian couple beside us who we chatted with and they brought up the same complaints.Maybe the breakfast everyone raves about below is worth it... but I would seriously never go here again.",

It is a bit hard to find but they do make an effort to put flags out on Byward Street. Service is quick so it's great for people who work around here to get in, have their breakfast and the way out. It's very bright and I think it is a great place to host events as it has extremely high ceiling with tall windows all 3 corners of the cafe. I was hoping for eggs benedict but they didn't offer it so got the english breakfast instead. Early bird special is only 6.5pounds and it also includes coffee! SUPER deal!",

    "text": "I like this place. It looks weird and underwhelming when you first walk in. It has the tell tale signs of a bad place, all those small signs out front directing you inside. We didn't have much of a choice as we needed a quick place to get brunch before going into Tower of London. I found this on Yelp and the reviews were solid. So is my review.The service was prompt and good. They're so friendly. I ordered a cup of tea with English breakfast and hash brown. It was really good! Nothing fancy, just the true English style breakfast you expect, done right. It reminded me of my childhood, eating this sort of brekky in Australia. I didn't try the coffee though, as I'm particular with my coffee as it has to be hipster as generally they're the best.The atmosphere is good. It's bright, airy and the garden was nice. Best thing about it is how cheap this place is! I will definitely have to come back as the price to quality ratio is high.",

Our waiter was so helpful and friendly, offering tips on getting around the city and what to see. Really nice full English breakfast as well, washed down with a Bloody Mary. The Vegetarian breakfast was also lovely, with grilled halloumi cheese, avocado, egg (fried or scrambled), mushrooms, hash brown, roast tomato, toast & butter. Highly recommend.",
