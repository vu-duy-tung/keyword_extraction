People are running around everywhere. You have to go up to counters to order food and come back to get it when your buzzer rings. While ordering our food, our designated seats were given to another group. When the buzzer rang, we went to collect our food, and to our surprise, it was no where to be found, as someone else stole our pizza. After arguing for 5 minutes, they agreed to make us a new one. \u00a0We waited another half an hour for the new pie. The food tastes like chemicals - specifically the tomato sauce and mozzarella, which happen to be on everything. Both pizzas we ordered were inedible. The pasta was edible but not good by any means. The garlic bread was recommended by a chef. It had no flavor and tasted no better than mass produced packaged bread. NOT an enjoyable meal. To top it all off, it was very overpriced. Not worth it whatsoever.",

Maybe if i understood more of what was happening it would have been better.I liked the vibe to the place though and it seemed a pretty cool to hang out and eat italian. maybe i'll have to give it another go sometime.",

I had the pepperoni pizza (salami) with Parmesan and red chill, paired with a nice San Pel limonata sparkling beverage! Very good.Service - so they don't really have table service here other than bussers, but I actually quite liked it! It's like an authentic pizzeria in a sense. They gave you an ordering card when you walk in and you take the card to whichever station you want to order from (pasta, insalate & antipasti, or pizza). Everything is prepared on the spot and they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. It's very nice, minimal fuss, and quite convenient on the go.Ambience - although it's simple, it's also quite trendy! I really like the fresh basil and oregano plants on the tables and the rustics sort of lay out! It's also very big with seating spread out on two levels.Location - right in the heart of Soho just on Wardour Street! Can't get any easier to find.Prices - very very good! I paid \u00a36.95 for a full pizza. Quite impressive actually!",

Then, after choosing what you want, you go up to the relevant counter - it's then made in front of your eyes; this means you can make additions, subtractions then and there and see them actually happen...and charged on your card (which you then settle on the way out). The food is also really good Italian. You can't book, but there's loads of seating.The only downside is that from the outside it looks like a standard restaurant...if I'd have known better sooner, I'd have been here ages ago.",

In addition food is bursting in flavor, with great bread and customer service to top things off.

I can assure you that there are a wide range of choices to pick inbetween the two and if you are a meat lover then my recommendations would be to have the Cognac (if you are having pasta) or the Calzone (if you are picking from the Pizza menu.Positives:-The ability to watch all the chefs make your dish right in front of you, which, gives you the added benefit of telling him which spices and saunces and cheeses in which you'll like to add to your dish.-I find not having the bog standard 2 to 1 table a positive. The downstairs part of the restaurant has eclectic bench and tables for you to sit at with a capacity of 6 to 8 so, you can be eating lunch/dinner and be joined with a single diner, a couple or a small group. I personally enjoy that, but, there are sections around if you prefer to be a hermit and stick to yourself-Last but not least, the price and portion size. Great value for money, massive portion size that I must recommend only getting a pizza or a pasta and not both. Negatives:-The pasta queue, but, in their defense, you'd wait the same time sitting down at a restaurant. ***Fun, fresh, well designed and maintained and value for money. Definitely worth a visit***",

You get a card when you get in and then you put all your meals on it. To check out simply give the card back to the cashier. It is basically a mini food court. You go to different stand to pick what you want. Nothing crazy here pizza, pasta, salad but it does the job. Pizzas have descent sizes. Pastas are quite big too. The food is not crazy good (Italian food is always easy though ) but because the place looks quite nice, especially at night, the system is simple and you are free to do your own thing and almost sure to find a seat, it gets 4 stars.

    "text": "Vapiano in Soho - a good, efficient, down-to-earth pasta (and pizza) restaurant with very friendly staff.Vapiano recently opened a new branch in Soho on Wardour Street, not too far from its other branch in Fitzrovia. Vapiano in Soho looks unmistakably like a Vapiano. If you have been to any Vapiano restaurant before, you will know what to expect. The only detail I missed was a pasta machine on display - perhaps only because some of them are from a company called \"G\u00f6tz\", which always makes me smile.When I walked in, I was given a plastic card as usual and went straight to one of the many pasta counters. I was served quickly by one chef in training supported by another guy who gave instructions - learning on the job. What I like about Vapiano is that you can see that your dish is freshly made, and you can watch the chefs cooking your meal. Of course, many components are prepared beforehand, but they are only put together after you ordered.Once the cooking was done, I sat down at one of the high tables - everything just looks like at every other Vapiano restaurant I know. In general, I like the clear design of the place and prefer Vapiano to almost any other \"fast food\" chain. Not least because you can grab some Haribo Gold-Bears on the way out!The staff at Vapiano in Soho were really friendly, smiling, and up for a little chat. They were even funny. Overall, I enjoyed this visit to Vapiano as much as my visits to other branches before - perhaps even a little more because of the great and charming staff here in Soho.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited London from MN USA. We are both vegans. We were out late one night and needed a late night place that served vegan food. We actually stopped by Yorica for vegan ice cream first, and we asked the worker there for recommendation for vegan food in the area that was open. She recommended Vapiano, specifically the (and I forgot what it was called) noodles with red sauce pasta. How it works:You get a card from the front desk. You go to the specific line to order the dish you want. They add it to your card. There is a pasta line, pizza line, apps line, drinks/desserts line. They add everything to your card, and you wait for your food, then find a seat. After you enjoy your dinner, you pay at the front desk. There is seating on the main floor, and then there is a lower level with even more seating! There's also a bar down there. The restrooms are also down there. Very big and nice bathrooms. We ordered that dish she recommended. The noodles with red sauce. I also ordered the garlic bread. It was good. The noodles were really good. The sauce was just good. The garlic bread was delicious for breakfast the next morning. LOL",

Kudos to those chefs that have to deal with customers staring at them each time. I like the concept. However, this place can get packed and it's certainly not the most relaxing environment to be in if you're looking for a quiet dinner/lunch. It's also probably not the most fun looking for a place to sit when it's super busy. That being said, I think the food is very nice and they have multiple options for you, pizzas, pastas, and salads, all made fresh.",

When you get there you receive a card that you scan throughout the night which essentially totals to be your bill. You need the card to order food, and if the restaurant is busy you'll be standing around for a bit to get your pasta/pizza/salad dishes.My friend and I split our two dishes. She got the carbonara and I chose the monthly risotto special. Both were bursting with flavour. What's great about the structure of the restaurant is because the chef makes your meal right in front of you, you are essentially able to ensure the meal is to your standards and is absolutely what you want.I recommend for a good eat, just would have rather known about the whole standing in lines upon lines for a meal prior to choosing the location.",

On arrival you are given a card to which any food or drinks you order are charged, and you settle your individual bill on the way out. This works really well when there's a group of you, no awkward bill to try and figure out who had what! The main meals are pizza or pasta based and all are cooked freshly in front of you. Choose the type of sauce, for example a Bolognese, and the type of pasta you'd like from a choice of 9 different variants. Extra chillies can be added to taste and fresh Parmesan can be grated over the top. If you order a Pizza, you're given a little vibrating device which goes off when the Pizza is ready. Of course desserts are available but each time I've been here I've had enough after my main course. Waiters will bring drinks to your table or you can go to the bar. The Peroni on draught was particularly delicious and \u00a34.75 for a pint is reasonable for a restaurant in Soho. Great service, the freshest food, delicious beer. I'm sure I'll return here many, many times!!",

The lady in the front of the restaurant did not explain the system properly to us because there was already a big line behind us and she was struggling dealing with payments and new customers by herself. The chefs are all very clearly very stressed out and did not understand what anyone was saying. The line was held up multiple times because a chef would miss an order or a dietary restriction. The food all comes out at different times which isn't really a problem because I think this restaurant is geared more towards business people on their lunch break and other single diners. The food itself is incredible, I will give you that, and it's really fun to watch the food get made in front of you. The restaurant is very beautiful and clean as well. But at the same time it's a complete mess and I have no clue how they are still getting business.",

To be honest, it was a first Vapiano visit for me so when I received a Vapiano card I \u00a0didn't know how to use it.My friends told me it's like a canteen style so you go to a counter where you order and a chef cook the dish in front of you! You need to choose what type of pasta noodle you want from a wide variety, which was quite hard!It was wonderful to see how the chef cook a pasta efficiently! It looked quick and easy but I know the chef needs to have good skills! Oh, don't forget to place the card over a card reader once you order! That's the reason you receive the card!The dining area was a bit dark and wooden style furniture made a lovely atmosphere. The pasta itself was amazing! As I also tried my friends' dishes, we reached a conclusion 'Simple is best!'I will definitely visit Vapiano again soon!",

My personal favourite is their pasta which is always cooked directly by a friendly chef who's more than willing to customise your dish. I usually add extra spinach and cherry tomatoes, but go without cheese. The portions are huge and the price for what you get is tiiiiiiiny (like you can't even see it on your bank statement). The interior is good for a chain as it is clean and fresh but also cosy and there is plenty of seats and tables available. I've been here during the quiet Tuesday evenings and the busy Friday lunch hours and always found myself a place to sit and enjoy my food. The soft drinks you can get directly from the chef but they also have a bar for coffee and other beverages. I absolutely recommend this place for any occasion, but maybe not for a children's birthday party. Ideal for lunch dates.",

What with their ordering system, of using a card then going to the food cooking stations, order your food and watch it cooked live in front of you, scan card and find a seat. I don't know, this concept works best in shopping mall food courts. I seen it work best at shopping mall food court. To bring it to a restaurant doesn't work as well. For starters, the food is getting cooked live and on a specific timeframe so there's bound to be mistakes, the most consistent one we found was the pasta in both our dishes needed another 4mins in salt water because it was all clumped together still. I ordered the pomodoro and choose penne pasta and it was essentially penne pasta, pomodoro sauce with a heavy onion presence. I mean heavy. My partner's bolognese was very unimpressive with that whole pasta uncooked thing. And you have the task of carrying all your food to find a spot at one of the dreaded share tables/benches. Really this entire establishment is like a soho-fancy high school cafeteria. Don't be fooled by my wonderful high quality pictures, tastes much worse than it looks. Maybe the pizzas or salads might taste better but if they can't even get the pasta right, well not cool in my book, better places to go!",

    "text": "Pasta is usually a safe bet as a vegan but when stumbled upon Vapiano and found they even have special vegan dishes I was thrilled. \u00a0 Upon entering you collect a card from the host and head to the specific station (pasta, salad, etc) that you'd like to order. You place your card on a sensor which activates the card with your order They cook right in front of you and then you take your food to whatever table you'd like. \u00a0Once you finish your meal you take your card to front desk and pay. Not fancy...but not fast food...just efficient and delicious.",

    "text": "Vapenos. I was in London for a couple of days and decided to try this restaurant when my partner had been the week before. As you enter they give you a plastic charge card. \u00a0All you simply do is go to various stations within the restaurant and order your food and you give your card and they charge to it (like a tab). You can have up to 9 different pasta choices with different sauces for your pasta. They also do pizzas garlic bread and it is all very reasonably priced considering its fresh ingredients and cooked fresh. \u00a0Not forgetting some of the deserts at to die for.",
