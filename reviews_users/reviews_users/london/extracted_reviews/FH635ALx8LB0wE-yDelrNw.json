Was feeling a touch peckish so ordered a burger and fries - Wow, I've never had a burger quite like it.. big compliments to the chef, it was the most delicious burger I have ever had, and I've had a few burgers in my time. Friendly service, very chic interior design without being too intimidating, love all the mirrors, all very glamerous and a big treat!! 4 1/2 hours later I had to cycle home in the semi-darkness and realised I'd left my bike lights at home - oooops!!!!",

However, the tables are small and packed in rather close together - it sort of produces a crowded feeling - not uncomfortable, but I certainly wouldn't want to have a heart-to-heart conversation here. \u00a0Our service was super-efficient... quick and smooth and painless... it was more utilitarian than personable, almost like we hardly knew our waiter was there, but no complaints since the execution was flawless.The wine list has a pretty large and diverse range of international options to choose from... but our waiter knew his stuff and was quite useful in helping us select a bottle.The food here is continental. \u00a0I had the seasonal salad and my friend ordered the halibut. \u00a0Our food was nice, but didn't have any *wow* factor... I could barely tell you what it tasted like the next day, let alone find myself craving it... The puddings sounded good, but we were in a rush to make our show, so unfortunately, we didn't have time to try one. \u00a0This place is beautiful to look at, but I probably wouldn't come again for dinner...the food simply wasn't enough to shout about. \u00a0But I definitely want to try it out again some weekend morning since it seems like so much more of a brunchy-type place and the breakfast menu looks so appealing.",

    "text": "To use a botany analogy, this is like seeing a beautiful garden only to discover it's filled with aphids. \u00a0It's not going to harm you, but it's both disappointing and not some place you want to stick around. To be fair, the food probably deserves 3 stars, but I'm docking one for the terrible service. \u00a0We called to make reservations for Saturday night and they were adamant that the only time available was 6:30 and we must clear out by 8:30. \u00a0Therefore you can understand our surprise when we showed up to find the restaurant completely empty, and continued to have free tables well after 9PM (more on why we were there so long later). \u00a0The food was decent but not particularly special. \u00a0I had the fish stew which had big chunks of salmon and halibut, plus a few orphan calamari. \u00a0The others ordered steak, which frankly looked like the steak frites you might find anywhere. \u00a0I will say that the dessert was amazing: rhubarb souffle with homemade almond ice cream. \u00a0It *almost* made me forget about the terrible service.First, no fewer than four different waiters served on us throughout the night. \u00a0Our first waitress was fine until we ordered a bottle of wine that had clearly gone off. \u00a0It was supposed to be a decent wine from the Loire region and certainly wasn't cheap, but to my novice palate tasted skunky. \u00a0My friends, who drink more than their fair share of fine wine agreed. \u00a0I told the waitress, wherein she took the bottle of wine away and then came back with it 3 minutes later declaring it \"just fine\". We weren't about to drink it, so we ordered a different bottle of wine while the still full glasses (and bottle) sat on the table the rest of the night. \u00a0 As we were choosing the next bottle, I asked for her recommendation between two bottles and she said she liked one more than the other but couldn't tell us why or even describe what they were like (I suspect the price point was driving her decision). \u00a0We went with the other bottle, and never saw her again. When 8:30 rolled around we were anxious for our bill. \u00a0Finally flagging down another waiter we got it, but then sat at our table for another 45 minutes until I managed to snag a fourth waiter to bring the card machine. \u00a0We had just watched the table beside us pay their bill and evidently there was something wrong with one of the card readers as it had declined everyone's card. \u00a0So when the waitress came to take my card, I asked her if it was the same machine - she didn't know. \u00a0My card was declined, a fact that she announced loudly. \u00a0I asked her to try another machine. \u00a0She asked for another card. \u00a0I stood my ground. \u00a0Ta-Dah! \u00a0Amazing - my card worked! \u00a0I noticed that she did not announce that fact as loudly. Not what I would call a great experience. \u00a0For that kind of money in this market you can get a lot better.",

Look out for the Naked Lawn Tennis soon.Located on the corner of the square The Botanist does all the three traditional meals of the day plus the very English addition of Afternoon Tea and plenty of snacks. There is a restaurant and a bar area here both of which are decorated with quite a bit of minimal elegance and understated charm. It makes a really good spot for a Sunday afternoon in particular. They do fantastic Bloody Marys, really good coffee and a great burger. Haven't eaten in the more formal dining area yet but from what I have had so far I'd expect one of the best meals to be found locally.",

    "text": "Great location, gorgeous interior, lovely bathrooms (it's important to me) and the food is decent. However, the service is just about the WORST I've encountered in ages.My friend and I wanted to go in for the afternoon tea, which is supposed to be served until 6pm. So we arrived at 4:45pm and were immediately informed by the hostess that they would need the table back by 5:30pm. We said fine. We ordered and a few minutes later a lovely three tiered tray of sandwiches and cakes arrived. Well that's nice but they forgot our tea, plates, jam and clotted cream- all of which we had to request be brought. By then the clock was ticking, so we inhaled our hot tea and food and were delighted with ourselves when we finished the last crumbs promptly at 5:28pm. No one had been by to check on us at that point, but we weren't bothered. However, 45 minutes then passed AFTER we finished and still no one came back to our table. We found it interesting that they'd been so insistent that we be out by 5:30pm but well after that they still hadn't bothered to acknowledge our existence. We'd been testing to see how long it would take for someone to notice us, but after awhile it got very frustrating so we flagged down a waitress who apologized half-heartedly and brought us our bill for 40 (including a 12% service charge). It pained me to fork out that much money for a mediocre meal with such horrible service, but we were just eager to leave. I'll probably make a complaint because it's a real shame that such a beautiful spot should be wasted.",

    "text": "I have been to the Botanist several times. As a bar in the evening it's a great location - buzzing atmosphere, great clientele, nice drinks. Not so for tea, alas. The main problem is the unfailingly poor service. This week I decided to meet a girlfriend for afternoon tea. We both work outside London, so looked for a venue which served tea as late as possible. The Botanist state on their website that they serve afternoon tea until 6pm, and at \u00a317 it is more reasonable than many premium locations which charge up to \u00a340. I booked online, requesting afternoon tea and a table by the window. The next morning I received an email confirmation, but on a hunch I decided to call to confirm. A surly manageress informed me that the last 'sitting' for afternoon tea was in fact 5.15pm. When I pointed out that it would be difficult to make it from work for 5.15pm she offered neither an apology, or a resolution. Only after much pressing did she grudgingly agree that if we arrived at 5.45pm there 'might' be something available.We arrived at 5.45 and were seated by the window. The Botanist's version afternoon tea is not quite Browns, but to be fair, neither is the price. You choose one delicious cake (we had a choice of 3 but it was the end of the day). You can also choose from an extensive tea menu. The sandwiches are pretty average - nothing special in terms of fillings and the bread is often semi stale on the outside - they are obviously pre-cut earlier in the day. The staff are very inflexible about filling choice - cheese without pickle was far too challenging, so not ideal if you are picky or have allergies. These are served with two very nice scones, jam and cream. Very patchy service - slow, rude, inefficient. Leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, which with all its attributes is a real shame. No top-up of hot water, no plates(!) - totally ignored. We waited 30 mins for the bill after asking twice, then gave up and walked to the till. Botanist - get your act together!",

    "text": "We're probably not the easiest family to please in a restaurant. On top of the everyday chit chat we always discuss the food and service in minute detail. This Father's Day we ventured to the newly opened The Botanist on Sloane Square.It takes time for new establishments to settle into a routine; The Botanist only opened in May, a short month before our visit. But basic mistakes kept creeping in and with five sister restaurants I had expected the whole operation to be a bit slicker.The restaurant is located next to the recently renovated Sloane Square Hotel. It was a busy Sunday and customers were certainly crammed into the dining area, making our table of five slightly uncomfortable. The place has a clean feel to it with calming tones and a historical mural which ties in with the restaurant's name.So to the meal The ladies forwent starters, so it was left to my father, brother and myself to sample: Stilton and white onion tart with roast pears, steak tartar and globe artichoke, morel and baby spinach risotto.The tart pastry was perfect - crumbly, but solid enough to hold the very flavoursome stilton filling. I was disappointed with the pears which, served cold, seemed more raw than roasted, and didn't have the required sweetness to offset the stilton's saltiness.The risotto sounded wonderful, but the creaminess which typifies risottos was swapped for a thin bland sauce which drowned the rice.The steak tartar was the first sign of trouble with the service. First my brother was brought a stilton and onion tart - not what he had ordered. As my father and I tucked into our starters, and finished them, he was still waiting. Steak tartar doesn't require huge amounts of cooking. Yet when it arrived it was overcooked. Had it perhaps been sitting on the passe for a bit too long.Being a Sunday it was beef roasts for the lads and fishcakes for the ladies (not that fishcakes are particularly Sunday food!). The fishcakes were a good size but a little bland. The meat was beautifully pink and tender. The jus arrived in a wonderful little copper saucepan. The Yorkshire puddings were also scrumptious: crispy on the outside and light and fluffy inside. The vegetables however were underdone and the potatoes were far too salty and reminded me of those packet roast potatoes from the supermarket.After the waiter finished spilling water over the table, and forgetting to wipe it up, we ordered dessert. Tarte Tatin was excellent. The pastry once again perfect. Just the right amount of caramel too. The chocolate fondant just dreamy. And the Knickerbocker Glory was, well just like being a kid again.The cheese plate ended an average meal. The minute slivers of cheese presented an uninteresting selection.Slow service, a clumsy waiter and average food (the quality of the met was a surprising highlight though) resulted in the manager gracefully removing the optional service charge from the bill. How kind! But as I said at the start, it takes time to settle down, so I look forward to a second visit to an establishment some promise. Food 3/5 - Fantastic meatService 2/5 - Get to grips with the basicsEnvironment 3/5 - Calm decor but much too crammed",

First the decor is amazing! The color scheme is so amazing; the lines of the furniture suggest art deco. They have a bar, which has a dinner like feel to it; only the prices of cocktails are anything but dinner style. As far as the food it was glorious, I recommend if you go on a Sunday to ask for the barbecue hamburger, it wasn't on the menu when I was there, but we saw it at another table and could not stop salivating. Also they have THE BEST Bloody Mary in London, perfect to sooth the soul. Service is impeccable, we had a lovely waitress, and they all seem to enjoy being there. Its a great place for Sunday Roast and to curb the crave for some wholesome food.",

Cocktails here are super A+ and extremely delicious. The pom collins had real pomegranate seeds and the Victoria Beckham gin cocktail I ordered was almost a piece of art as it contained a cucumber slice that wrapped around the entire inside of the glass. Seating seems difficult and you should likely pre-book though we hovered creepily by the bar for around 10 min and managed to scrounge up a table in the bar area.What gets me about this place is actually the atmosphere. You'll find plenty of the Chelsea crowd lingering about and bright young things with digital SLRs (Rag&Bone is almost next door FYI). I was also here during some runway show happening in Sloane Square so there were just lots of trendy gaunt youths milling about and Instagram portraits in the making. It was a sunny day and between the navy, double-breasted, gold button blazer wearing older man reading the paper to my left and the two American ladies-who-lunch to my right (\"OMG! My boyfriend went to business school with him!\") who ordered virgin bloody marys (what are these? why would you have these? isn't this just tomato juice with extra tabasco at this point????), I almost forgot that I just paid upwards of 20 quid for a salad.",

I found the service to be pretty decent: quick, attentive, polite. The food was also good too, with the roast beef I enjoyed falling second only to Hawksmoor's outstanding effort.By night, it's a swanky bar where the moneyed Chelsea set congregate: the guys in suits and blazers; the women in glamorous dresses. The drinks menu and prices are reasonable: despite its prime location, there are plenty of more expensive bars to be found down Kings Road.Overall, it's a pretty solid bet whenever you happen to swing by.",

    "text": "One of the restaurants conveniently situated on Sloane Square, where my friend and I decided to have Sunday lunch as a change from his favorite, Colbert. I ordered the monkfish special and he ordered the crab linguini; they were more like dinner options but was either a lunch/dinner menu or Sunday roast. The restaurant was half empty when we sat down at 12, but became relatively full over the next hour and a half. I think it's more of a nice business lunch type of setting, relatively quiet and was nice with the windows open and natural sunlight, where people can relax and take their time. As for the food, the monkfish was well cooked and dressed with a few vegetables, but overall very much fine dining and I came away a bit hungry without an appetizer. The crab linguini, however, looked amazing and I would have definitely been happy with that. My friend told me that this place is also very popular for drinks, so will have to return to check that out.",

If you're lucky enough to find a seat, the toffee apple cocktail will change your life.On a Saturday morning, the half of this place with just tables is a lovely place to hang out. But, it's always rammed and you can't book that area. Try your luck, have cocktails or a mimosa with friends, and it's a blast. It's not cheap, but hey, you're in Sloane Square - be realistic.The other half of the place you can reserve a table in. I'm less convinced. Sure service is attentive, but the prices are phenomenal, for food that you'd probably get the same quality of elsewhere. A double eggs benedict costs \u00a312.50. The ham was delicious, but other than that - it's just not that special.I also had lunch here yesterday, and though it was nice because of the company, the tables are too tightly arranged and my salmon fishcake was nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "In a restaurant on Sloane Square, you might expect good food and drink but you would definitely expect great service. I was taken here for a pre-theatre meal by my other half's family, 7 of us in total. From the outside The Botanist looked very neat, the black and white exterior with its touch-of-green lighting inside complementing the restaurants name nicely. Inside you could tell you were on Sloane Square. Suits everywhere, bustling atmosphere and in my jeans and trainers I felt slightly out of place, though there were the odd few guys dressed the same so I wasn't put off. We waited patiently past the bar at the entrance to the tabled section and while waiting got told off by a member of staff for being in the way of the restaurant. We politely remarked we were actually waiting for someone to seat us and with a brief apology she walked off. Eventually seated we all ordered fairly quickly as the show was ever approaching. The tables were cramped and all very close together as if they had tried to fit as many in as possible. It was quite hard to navigate around and between them on the way in and out, and for seven, the table was very small. The food was good, but could have been better. My steak was cooked well, but was very fatty though the chips were good though could have been more like an armadillo - crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside - as it were they were quite stodgy. Other meals on the table were equally in the category of 'nothing to write home about'. Service was slow and abrupt and prices (though I wasn't paying) were expensive for the quality of the food. Of course though, you are paying for location in this neck of the woods... However, the redeeming feature for me was the d\u00e9cor. I loved the look of the place, the wooden floor and the walls covered with photos of animals and flowers that looked like they had been taken from an old science textbook were a great touch. Reading other reviews it seems the drinks are the star of the show here rather than the food but unfortunately I didn't volunteer my services for cocktail tasting this time.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with some family while I was in the UK for business and what can I say - I love the neighborhood of Chelsea and all its establishments and the Botanist was no exception. I love the atmosphere - very reminiscent of the trendier, classy bars in NYC. Once you enter, the space reminds you of a nice living room with stylishly sleek furniture and open space. The crowd is on the younger side - I'd say late twenties to early thirties. The vibe was energetic with people mingling and chatting, but it never got overcrowded or too loud.For dinner, we got an awesome round table in the middle of the dining section (note the bar area and dining section are separate here). Everything was pleasant about dining here - \u00a0the sommelier was informative when asked, and service really didn't skip a beat. The food was pretty good, but not spectacular. I ordered the seabass with a side of steamed napa cabbage. The fish was very fresh and cooked perfectly. Only complaint about this dish and the side is that it was very salty. I also noticed that in the UK, they like to serve fish skin side up - I have no qualms about this but I could see how it might make other Americas a bit squeamish. ;)Portions wise, the fish was filling but some of the other meat dishes (lamb, steak) were much smaller in portion compared to what you'd find in the US, but that's expected. All dishes tasted great in terms of flavor, and the presentation and preparation were excellent.Overall great experience - I would dine here again or come for drinks. I would just ask they hold back a bit (or a lot) on the salt.",

Girlfriend had a cocktail from the menu which was sickly sweet and very weak. I had a classic cocktail (Sazerac) which was similarly weak, improperly served on the rocks (they could have at least asked), and completely missing its key ingredient (absinthe).",

    "text": "After a day at London Fashion Weekend me and my friend decided to finish the day treating ourselves to a nice dinner and we know this place was supposed to be quite good. We were lucky enough to get a table although we were told we'd have to leave in an hour because there was another booking.The menu is lovely and everything looks delicious but it is also quite pricey so we decided to take advantage of the set menu option that was valid till 6.30. That is a great deal because it cuts the price to less than half of what you'd normally pay and you get the same amount of food. There was a small issue with the waiter being reluctant to bring us that menu, then claiming we were too late and it stops at 6.30 sharp even if it was still 6.20 and me having to actually show him the time on my phone. I kinda felt like he did not like me much after that but he was still \u00a0extremely polite anyway and the rest of the staff were absolutely lovely.The food itself was delicious. I had the schnitzel (soft and juicy) and my friend had the fish cake (surprisingly filling) and we also had the burrata and whitebait starters and some red wine.The atmosphere was very nice as well, it felt grown up and sophisticated, just like a nice restaurant should be and they also treated us to a piece of chocolate at the end.I would definitely recommend this place to celebrate a special occasion or to meet with relatives or as a treat after a day shopping designer clothes in the area. Just make sure to book a table to avoid disappointment.",

The bright young things spill onto the pavements of Sloane Square in the summer, making this a lively and fun spot for a drink. \u00a0The cocktails are also very good. The apple meringue pie martini is gloriously topped off with a mound of sweetened whipped egg white.The decor is understated comfortable chic. I have eaten here several times, although not on this latest visit. It is an idea to book, but we usually just turn up around 8.30 or 9pm and get seated after a short wait. I must say that food is acceptably good, but not spectacular. Staff are charming, discrete, friendly, and unlike a previous reviewer mentioned, they did recognise us on a follow up visit. An easy choice when in the area, that has been worthy of return visits.",

    "text": "Finally, I can get a proper dirty martini without someone looking at me like I have three heads or something when ordering. Needless to say the bar is good and always quite busy. On good weather days you'll see folks gathered around the outside. The inside bar area is usually packed. The dining room is elegant and trendy with comfortable furnishings. I've always enjoyed the items I've ordered and most recently I got the cod which was as good as the presentation. (See photo) They have a nice wine selection as well and the staff is \"usually good\" however we've had a few that seemed to be unhappy to be at work. Upon a previous visit my guest, a colleague ordered steak (medium) which arrived quite tough, over-cooked and inedible for her. The server removed it then offered something else which she agreed however left her quite disappointed. It's never good when your dinner guest doesn't enjoy themselves. My colleague didn't consume either meal however we were charged for one of them. I was surprised that our server didn't recognize that this second meal was barely touched. As someone who worked in a restaurants years ago I understand the repercussion of an unhappy guest. She has yet to return and I hate she had a bad experience since I'd shared with her that it was a good restaurant.On my most recent visit the meal was great and all went well aside from the fact they had run out of all features of the evening by 7:30 which my visiting friend found disappointing. He had his eye on one of the specials but settled on anther item and the starter feature which was the only available item on their list of the day. I asked the server how they had run out of the features so early in the evening. Her response was \"You know we have a lunch too and it was quite busy today\" - yeah, I let that go however she may not have intended that to sound rude but it did and my guests thought so too. Clearly we know now that if a special is good one must go for lunch to try it.If The Botanist were a bit friendlier and recognized repeat customers it'd be nice. I've introduced four others to this place and dined there six times in the last six months and apparently their computers do not track repeat customers which is unfortunate. Other places where I've dined the same amount or less seems to recognize customers which is always appreciated. So this American Southerner in London has found a fabulous dirty martini and a good meal at The Botanist but says y'all could use some minor improvements on hospitaltiy.",
