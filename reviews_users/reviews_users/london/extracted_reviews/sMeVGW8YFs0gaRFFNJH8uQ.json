Even if the food was good (which it was not) I would have left with a very bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "I'll have to differ with the most glowing of Halepi's reviewers, while still maintaining that it's a solid restaurant.Our food (taramosalata, spanakopita, kleftikon) was prepared very quickly. The taramosalata was very good (but that's essentially just a dip); the spanakopita was somewhat lacking, tasting a bit rubbery and perhaps overfried. The kleftikon, however, was delicious and tender, definitely one of the culinary highlights of this trip to London. Overall, I'd have to say that I'll make an effort to visit Halepi on future visits to the UK, but it doesn't especially stand out in comparison to Greek restaurants I patronise in the states, or any average restaurant you'd run across in Greece itself. In the bleak gastronomic scene of London, however, it's quite good.",

    "text": "For me, Halepi is simply an 'institution' in London. Obviously, my passion for both London and Greek islands may be playing a role in this judgment... but I know I am one of many estimators of this small (and always full) Greek restaurant in the Bayswater area.The atmosphere is cozy and friendly, with rows of tables, set-up in 'old' Greek style, where both couples and groups of friends sit next to each other - and sometimes even socialize during dinner...Coming to food, there is a wide selection of typical starters such as tzatziki, melizanosalata (sauce with aubergines), taramasalata (never understood what's exactly in it, but it's fish and it's very good...) All to be shared, along with the typical 'pita' bread. By the way, for those who don't know, Greek cuisine shares a lot with Middle Eastern food tradition. But make sure you leave enough space for the main courses! My favourites:- Dolmades: typical wine leaves stuffed with rice and meat- Souvla: 'best lamb on spit' - as defined in the Halepi menu :)- Klefticon, a slow-cooked lamb served with spices: large enough to fill you up alone...I am not passionate about Greek desserts, so I always rather conclude my dinner with a good ouzo...Finally, the staff is super-friendly. A special mention for Ben the waiter, who always remembers me and my friends everytime we go back there, even after years!Prices are on 'London average', i.e. 30 to 40 pounds for a full dinner. But I never left Halepi hungry or unhappy about the quality, and often I skipped breakfast the morning after...Five stars widely deserved!",

    "text": "Yelpers have really let me down on this one, and this is not the first time this has happened in London. But after this, I think I might stop trusting London Yelp altogether.The food is NOT 4- or 5-star. Maybe it once was, but not anymore. My friend and I had some questions about the menu, because nothing has descriptions and we are not familiar with Greek food. After maybe our third inquiry, the waitress literally told us to come with her so she could show us the food in the display case because, quote \"this is clearly your first time in a Greek restaurant.\" Really rude. You're served olives, pita bread, and a plate of raw radishes, scallions, and jalapeno peppers. Not seasoned or anything, just as they are. I'm all for scallions, but raw? And I don't tend to eat jalapeno peppers whole either. Or radishes for that matter. So when our main meal came, the same waitress asked if she could take the plate away because, quote, \"you barely touched it.\" Again, rude and unnecessary comment. The eggplant and the tabouli dipping sauces were both good. But the mousaka (even I, in my DEEP ignorance, know that this is a Greek staple) was so, so lacking. Orange grease everywhere, not very flavorful, and unappealing texture. The veggies, also, were dredged in the orange grease. My friend's quail looked pretty dry, and the waitress got all defensive when she had simply commented on how tiny it was. I tried eating as much as I could, but, just as I had feared, no joke, the good ol' waitress returned and said \"I must be honest with you ladies, you are really not good eaters! Was it ok?\" I should not have to apologize for not finishing a mediocre meal, but I did apologize, and told her that it WAS mediocre. She didn't care. And then at the table next to us, I overheard a woman making a complaint about her meal, and the same waitress told her \"this is the best dish on the menu.\" Nope, that's not how you take a customer's complaint.Literally to prove to her that we could finish a dish, we ordered dessert. The pastry that wasn't baklava. It was really pretty bad. In sum, food and service definitely not worth the price.",

The decor is trapped in a time warp - no updating done here. It's legendary amongst the locals and has been going for ages so that's always a good sign. It can get very busy and so booking may be advised on traditionally busy nights. There's a friendly and exuberant vibe and staff greeted regulars warmly. I liked the thick curtain in front of the door which kept the place cosy and the bowl of oranges near the door was a nice touch too.",

Houmous ok, pittas delicious, salad fresh and with good leaves/tomatoes, meditarranean cucumber and soft tangy feta. Calamari were fresh with that real taste of the sea (horrid cliche, apologies, but true all the same!) and light non-oily batter. Klefticon was flavoursome meat, seasoned/spiced delicately (for meditarranean cooking) and cooked so that it could be taken off the bone with a fork & spoon. I love this restaurant: it doeswhat a restaurant is supposed to do for me. It's comfortable, congenial, the decor is dated/tiredbut comfortable (we had a large table so not squashed). The food is simple possibly staple Greek dishes and some English 70s classics (think Simon Hopkinsons 'The Prawn Cocktail Years'). For me, it's no bad thing not knowing how old the olive oil is and who baked the bread. I love it, and long may it continue to do what it's doing.",

We were immediately greeted and made to feel at home. Food was superb. We were given olives once we were seated, and our basket of warmed pitta bread was topped up automatically once consumed. I ordered the Special lamb kebab and my other half ordered the Baby lamb shanks both with rice. Food was cooked to absolute perfection- and generous portions at that! Tender and juicy on the shanks and rustic beautiful grilled flavours of the kebab. For dessert we ordered the Greek coffee (which comes served in an espresso sized cup) and one slice of baklava to share (by this point we were far too full to have our own dessert each- generous portion again), but before we ordered our dessert, we were given a complimentary small dish of turkish delight. I don't normally like Turkish delight as I find it is perfume flavoured, but this particular one was scrumptious and not perfumed at all! The bill came to \u00a357 between the two of us. Service charge included.Reasonably priced considering the quality of food and service! All in all, a rare gem hidden away in Central London. Will definitely go back since it's yards away from us!(They do Takeaways too!!)",

It's not fancy or fussy, but it is delicious.You will come here for the Klefticon, the fall-off-the-bone, slow-cooked lamb that Greek food is famous for. You'll press lightly on the meat with the back of the fork and notice it squish softly onto the side of the plate. You'll cut a piece of roasted potato, and drive it around your plate into the meat drippings, picking up a few bits of roasted onion and fat. It will be delicious but so huge you can't even finish. You'll want to save the rest for breakfast.Before that, you will have feasted on big and juicy olives, both black and green. You will have cleansed your palette with radishes, green onions, and peppers. You'll order a bottle of wine and ask, \"What part of Greece is it from?\" The answer: \"I have no idea. The good part.\" After ordering it, you'll accept that, yes, wherever it was, it was from the good part.On your way out, as you gush to the owner about the lamb, he will proudly show you the dusty celebrity photos of London's famous who come here for a fantastic and fuss-free meal. Gluten-free notes: Most Greek food is naturally gluten-free. You will eat very well with few restrictions. Beware the moussaka -- the traditional recipe calls for flour.",

The food from starters, mains and dessert are all incredibly flavorful and the portions generous, so you're going to want to be hungry enough to try a little of everything! A couple of Greek friends recommended this restaurant and my husband and I were very excited to meet them for lunch yesterday as it's always a good idea to follow where the natives eat \u00a0After yesterday, I don't think I could eat Greek food anywhere else in London. This is THE place to go for an authentic Greek meal. The Kazolides family have been running the restaurant since 1966 and I can see why they have been so successful through the decades! They gained a new loyal fan - I'm hooked.Food is simple, fresh and perfectly seasoned and prepared. We ordered a wide variety of starters and grilled meats - everything was top quality. Needless to say, we were all stuffed and were grateful to the server for wrapping up the kebabs we didn't quite finish to take home. A few favorites that I highly recommend include: - Greek Sausages (Loukanika): This was my first time trying these and loved the mix of spices and slightly smoky taste. - Tzatziki: I've had this cool, creamy & tangy cucumber dish before, but this was the best version I've had. They nailed the balance of flavors. Very addicting and was especially good with the chicken kebabs later in the meal. \u00a0- Saganaki (Pan fried Greek cheese): It's hard to resist a fried cheese dish! No idea what kind of cheese they used, but its crispy pan fried outside and melty center was yum! - Lamb on Spit: I ordered the Chicken Kebabs as they are my usual favorite and they were wonderful, but after a bite of this lamb cooked on the spit, I think it might be my new favorite (at least here anyway). Wow, no clue how they get the lamb so tender and the slight charred bites from the spit add an amazing meaty flavor. - Galaktoboureko (Custard in Phyllo Dough): I was going to order the baklava but my friends encouraged me to try this one since I've never had it. Again, their recommendation was right on. Cool custard inside a flaky phyllo dough drizzled with a light honey syrup - dee-licious!- Greek wine: Selected a Greek red, which was a nice pairing. I'll need to keep an eye out for Greek wines in the future. Atmosphere is intimate and casual with closely placed tables and brightly colored table covers. It can be quite crowded and hard to move around, but I think it's part of the charm - it feels and tastes like a family owned and operated restaurant. Service was speedy and friendly. Overall a remarkable experience!Note: Be sure to make a booking ahead to ensure you get a table. Or, they also have takeaway service if you can't get a spot :)",

I'd give them 1.5 stars because I think they tried (and will round up to 2 stars). \u00a0Their intent notwithstanding, they failed. \u00a0Tip for the owner: Get a new butcher, buy better meat, and/or use the meat before it goes bad.",

Halepi provides a number of complimentary appetizers like pita, olives, shallots, and radishes that tasted great with the hummus we ordered. We loved the moussaka and the fresh squeezed orange juice was to die for, but the lamb roast wasn't to our taste as it was quite salty. I would definitely come back to Halepi.",

Simply because if you are expecting a bit of privacy then this is not the place as it is pretty much like sitting with lots of people on one large table as the tables are very very close together. They have a great variety of food and the food is homemade and tastes very authentic. They have been established for a long time and the owners work there and that is why it has retained a high value as they care about their restaurant and customers. Their desserts are not great but the mains and starters are good and very generous in portions. I wouldn't recommend their creme caramel despite them thinking it is one of their specialties unfortunately the flavour is not great at all.

    "text": "This is the Greek meal I've been waiting for, for a while. I live in San Francisco and there really aren't the Greek or Greek-owned \"diners\" like in NY which serve Greek specialties.I started out withe spanakopita \u00a0(spinach pie) which I'd been craving for MONTHS. Perfect ratio of spinach to cheese and nicely spiced. Had the moussaka which was put together quite nicely with an extra sprinkling of cheese on top & accompanied by sauteed FRESH broccoli, carrots and narrow string beans. The bechamel stood up to the other ingredients in the moussaka and was subtly seasoned just right.Someone in another review complained about the \"cover.\" It was just 1 pound. And I got SO MUCH I didn't expect: an assortment of black and green olives, radishes, green onions, some hot peppers, bread (nicely warmed) plus at the end this marvelous rose flavored delight/gel dusted in confectioners sugar (which I'd never had before but really put me in a state of ecstasy). Also though not on the menu, I was able to get retsina by the glass (priced just like the house white/red).The meal was perfectly timed, there was no rushing me out, and the service was friendly (even though I'd not been there before ).At the table next to me they were having mixed mezze including two kinds of calamari and they got a sharing plate of grilled meats and seafood, which looked perfectly tender and cooked (I was watching a regular table wear knife EASILY cut into the lamb.",

We had the lamb casserole ( loved it!), grilled lamb kebab, quail kebab, moussaka (creamy goodness!) and a Greek salad. \u00a0If that wasn't enough we had the baklava which had a refreshing citrus/lemon finish to it. \u00a0I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London.",

The food is authentic and therein lies it strength as a restaurant. The hummus is a must order to accompany the pita and veggies/olives that they give you soon after you sit down. The hummus is so smooth and silky. We also keep ordering the fantastic octopus salad. The grilled calamari is very good. Any lamb dish here will be a treat. The servings are very generous. Over tonight's dinner, we struck up a conversation with a nearby table mate who is Greek. He came to school in London and stayed on. He's been coming to Halepi for 20+ years. In order to fully enjoy yourself here, you have to realize that it's like dining in a family house. The wait staff can be welcome and warming one minute and abrupt the next. The decor is simple. Staff sometimes bump your chair as they negotiate the narrow aisles. But in the end, it just feels like you're eating authentic, traditional food in someone's dining room in the Greek countryside.",

Man, was it good! Freshly baked pita, delicious hummus, tzatziki, eggplant, tabbouleh, and halloumi for starters. Then the calamari, prawn, stuffed grape leaves, lamb, chicken, and greek salad... it was a lot of food but all very very good. You could taste the freshness especially with the prawn, calamari, and tabbouleh. All closed with a few Turkish delights. Delicious foods, comfortable and unpretentious surrounds, and great service.
