The style of this place is great (amazing copper piping light fixtures around the ceilings, beautiful pastry spread up front), the food was impressively good (taking standard breakfast classics and upping their game a bit), the coffee was good, and the garden oasis out back provides a night haven from the bustling city at it's doorstep. In fact I'm having a hard time convincing myself to get out and try somewhere new for breakky this morning. Thank you for rocking, Trade! (See you in ten minutes!)",

I would definitely recommend to everyone and come back. This is now my go to local brunch spot.",

But the inside of the cafe tells a different story. The aroma that greets you once inside is very enticing. The decor is modern and minimalistic, with ample use of wooden benches which are crammed into every which corner of the smallish seating area. This does make life a bit difficult if you are here to spend some time. The food is great though and very american. The pastrami could have been better, but the pancakes were excellent. The latter could be improved by serving it with melted butter and more syrup! The menu is quite well thought out, and I would love to try out the rest of it in subsequent visits. Oh, and I liked the latte in the tumbler, it was a nice touch, and reminded me of how I used to drink tea/coffee back home in India.",

Got the Gruber and whoa! Being an avid fan of pastrami and being a New York loving American I knew what good pastrami was and by golly this place has damn good pastrami! Whaaaaaat! So delicious. I was immediately impressed even with a take away and walking at least 10 minutes until I unwrapped that goodness and was able to eat it. Still hot, so fresh, so flavorful, so so good. Every bite was better than the next. Highly highly recommend! The only bummer about the visit was when I tried to order a slice of their delicious looking cakes (banana mmm) I immediately got denied with a \"sorry we aren't selling those anymore\" without any further explaination. They just started walking off with plates of half gone cakes and pasteries and that was that. Too bad my friend had to miss out and get her dreams crushed. My coffee was also top notch. Loved this place and think everyone should go. Cheers.",

I was looking for another restaurant at the time and I was attracted by the delicious-looking spread of food I could spy on the counter.I popped in to have a closer look at the sandwiches and study the menu. Even leaving aside the counter food, there are plenty of tempting lunch options.I had the slow cooked pork and apple slaw which came on a toasted brioche bun. Delicious. It looked too hard to pick up and eat like a burger, so I improvised. I was eating the bun with my left hand and using my fork to shovel the rest of it, in between bites.I am quite keen to go back soon and try some of the other things. I might go for the pancakes next time.",

    "text": "Trade is my favourite breakfast spot. It's got practically everything you need in for a good lazy weekend breakfast. First up, the food. Trade offers up the usual kind of breakfast food you might find in other diners in the area such as pancakes and egg dishes and all that sorts of things, but what they also offer are incredible lobster rolls, smashed avocado on sourdough bread and delicious, delicious pastrami sandwiches, probably the best in London, according to those in the know. Next, the space. Trade is open and airy, and even has a secret garden, great for those all-too-rare warm London days. It's not too cramped, and there's a nice communal table at the back as well. The cafe offers free wifi and there's lemon-infused (depending on when it was last refilled) water as well. And, best of all, they have newspapers which anyone can read through. I don't know about you, but that's my key ingredient for a lazy breakfast.They also do photo exhibitions in here. The first time I went in, they had an exhibition featuring various curry chefs on Brick Lane. I really liked the East End communal spirit this invoked.Next, the drinks. I'm not a big fan of the coffee here as there are others in the area which do better flat whites, but, at the very least, it's tolerable. I tend to stick to tea when I am in here for that reason, but, that said, they have fresh mint tea, so that's all fine with me.Last, the staff. The staff have always been very friendly each time I've been in, and they have also been patient when we have been taking our time in terms of figuring out what it is we would like to have from their extensive menu. In my mind, Trade has been a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood indeed. Five stars.",

The salads and quiches here are also great. I haven't tried the breakfasts yet but they look amazing, especially the avocado on sourdough. The coffee and cakes are also really good. The setting is nice despite being on a busy road - the tables are all out at the back with a glass back wall that opens out to a little courtyard. Also good for takeaway.",

The Reuben sandwich at Trade is one of those times. I can't speak for anything else, but all the cakes, salads, coffees... \u00a0Mmm. It all looks brilliant, and if the Reuben is anything to go by it will taste marvellous too. Do come, do. Have the Reuben. Have it a lot.",

The d\u00e9cor was industrial hipster and quite well coordinated. However, due to them trying to accommodate as many patrons as possible, there were too many tables in too small of a space, leading to a slight feeling of claustrophobia. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with apple cider sauce. It was okay, the pork was a bit too tough and dry for my liking. The dishes such as the benedict options and the pastry cakes at the other tables seemed quite good though, so I would come back despite the mediocre pulled pork sandwich.",

My husband and I ordered the chicken, bacon avocado club and pancakes with scrambled eggs. Both were very good. The staff there is friendly too. Good spot for brunch!",

The breakfast and lunch selection is fresh and full of natural colour although staff are often kept very busy and in the many times I have visited we are often held waiting just to pay the bill.I think I have been through the menu here, from the pancake with blueberry compote (\u00a33.50 for a compote on the side can't be right?!) to the satisfyingly large sandwiches. The gentlemen at the front of house are great and it's clear to see they love what they do and get energised from being around customers (The bandana wearing dude is super welcoming!).Although generally quite good value for money, some items are a little overpriced in my opinion when looking at what you are paying for. However, the staff are generally friendly and there is often a queue out the door, they are doing something right!",

I got the avo smash toast with both the bacon and grilled chorizo and every bite was soooooooo good. Meanwhile my friend got the pastrami benedict. The toasted cholla roll looked pretty greased up but i bet it was worth it.

This is basically a large coffee shop serving up brunch items that include some pretty amazing looking pancakes dressed in a variety of toppings (you've got your choice of chocolate chip, fruit compote, eggs and bacon, etc).Service was extremely slow for a restaurant that was barely at 50% capacity, so be prepared to proactively ask for everything you need. The patio is small, but a great place to dine when the weather is nice. Being on a (short-lived) health kick, I had the smashed avocado entree, which came with chorizo and poached eggs on sourdough. Delicious, but of the quality you could probably make at home. I could still taste the vinegar on the poached eggs, although the consistency of the insides were nice and runny.Also had the detox \"smoothie\", which was basically a green juice. Yummy, made me feel healthy.You pay for your meal at the register, which is a blessing when you're in a rush. The display at the register includes an array of amazing looking cakes and pastries.

The food is delicious as well as the beverages with large portions for a great price (especially in London). Would recommend eggs on toast, with literally anything. We did see a waffle though that we want to go back for. All in all this is a great way to start your day in London.",
