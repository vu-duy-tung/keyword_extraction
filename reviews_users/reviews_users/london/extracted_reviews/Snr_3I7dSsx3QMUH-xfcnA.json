    "text": "Food was lovely, and I really enjoyed it. Great price too. Only issue was my friends poached eggs were over cooked and not runny. She doesn't like to complain so we didn't ask to change them. So we can't complain too much as we didn't let anyone know. But as she said, she was a bit annoyed as we can both make poached eggs ourselves really well. So a bit miffed about that, especially as they are called the breakfast club Oh and they don't do syrups for the coffees?!? What?!? Couldn't get a vanilla latte, and they only do semi-skimmed milk rather than skimmed?!? Bit odd I \u00a0Thought everywhere did skinny coffees and flavoured syrups these days.Tried the Canary Wharf branch as thought it would be less of a queue, we still had to wait around 45 minutes. However we had a takeaway coffee whilst we waited And they gave out small samples of smoothie whilst we waited. But the staff were lovely and the food was really nice, just thought it's a bit hyped up. I.e. It's not as great as everyone makes out it is. Great breakfast spot and glad I've been. Not sure if I would bother going again if I have to wait 45 minutes. I mean it was great just not amazing!",

    "text": "I would honestly give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. A good friend of mine has been recommending the chain for quite some time and we finally went today. We had a party of 4 and waited approximately 45 minutes to an hour for a table which is insane. (I personally never wait in lines for a restaurant and I will never do it again). Once we were seated, we ordered coffees and beverages which took 25 minutes to arrive at our table. There were customers that were seated after us and had received their food before we did. When we finally were served, the food was cold. The wait staff was awful for a well known brunch spot on a Sunday afternoon and the line wouldn't have been so long had the workers been more efficient and taken 20+ minutes to make a mocha and americano. Overall, the quality of the food doesn't come anywhere near the price and it was such a bad experience that I won't even venture to one of the other Breakfast Clubs to see if this one (in Canary Wharf) was having a bad day. (Not to mention that staff and baristas behind the bar were texting in between making drinks/delivering food to tables. Quite unsanitary). Try a non-chain, unique, local, place in London. Stray far away from this place.",

It is not as cozy as the one in Angel or as genuine as the one in Hoxton (before the refurbishment) or has a cool fridge like the one in Liverpool Street, but the food is as good as it is in any of the other ones. It is bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside and we didn't have trouble finding a table for 4 on a Sunday evening. The stage is very 60s-70s and massive compared to the one in Hoxton. There was not live music when we went. but they had the program hanging on the walls.The food was good as always. At first, I wanted the famous pancakes and berries, but I decided that real food was better at that time and had the halloumi wrap and a milkshake and both were delicious. My friends seemed satisfied as well with their food, so we left the place happy and full.",

I've been disappointed by some Breakfast Club branches in the past, which have become too touristy, but thought I would give this one a try.First of all, because it's not in the center, there is much less queue than at some BC, so we didn't wait too long to get a table (this might change after the Crossrail opens, but we will see). I loved the inside. You enter through a bar/cafe area, and the main restaurant is upstairs and much bigger that other BC \u00a0one of the other reason why you don't queue too much maybe too. The setting is really like an Old American Dinner, but don't go there for a quiet moment, as it is really noisy.I think not all BC are equals in terms of quality of food but this one didn't disappoint, the menu offers all the BC classics served in huge quantities, and their pancakes are still very good :)Maybe a bit of a slowish service but it was ok as we were not in a hurry, and the staff was very friendly.We definitely go back now that it is so close to home! :)",

I purposely waited til after 9am to visit as I thought it might be full of office-types before that but it was pretty empty when I arrived. I ordered eggs royale with a side of avocado as well as home-style fried potatoes. My food arrived pretty quickly and looked beautiful. Sadly one egg had a really tiny yolk (sad times), some of the avocado was in massive chunks and the potatoes were pretty meh. I've had many an eggs royale in my time and this was pretty sub-standard -\u00a0and expensive! Positives were that the staff were really friendly and the place is pretty cool, decor-wise. I wouldn't rush back though. Surely there must be a good breakfast option in Canary Wharf?!",

You might have to queue but for this one, Saturday morning 10.45, we were 5 and did not wait for a table! Lucky maybe? The staff, so so nice, funny and helpful. (And that's valid for the 3 breakfast club I have been to : wardour street, Hoxton/ old street and this one carnarby street) Now the food: OMG, especially their pancakes! This time I choose Benedict eggs with potatoes, excellent and the pancakes with vanilla cream and berries. I was full and could not finish the pancakes so I would suggest you go for eggs and share the pancakes with one person on your table. Drinks: nothing extraordinary, drinks are ok, juices is freshly pressed, just what you need. Finally the bill: payed \u00a318 (we shared the bill) for benedict eggs with potatoes, a latte and pancakes. This is reasonable I think especially that I was not hungry until 7 in the evening!",

They advised that we get there right at noon to ensure a seat as they typically fill up toward 12:30. They were right and we were able to get a cosy both in the upstairs room.The d\u00e9cor is whimsical and fun taking me back to an old American diner. Upstairs there is also a stage for bands and a bar area. Looks like a fun place to come to in the evenings.We all decided on breakfast for lunch and were not disappointed. I ordered the 'huevos rancheros' while my other two ladies ordered the 'all american' and 'berry pancakes'. My dish was not what I was expecting from my pervious experience with this Mexican dish, but it was still very good and flavourful. I also got to take a few bites of the amazingly fluffy and sweet pancakes. Nice work Breakfast Club, how do you do it!We were all satisfied with our meals and overall experience. The servers were very nice and made us feel at home. The price is a little more than I like to pay for lunch, but as a special treat on a Friday, it hit the spot.",

We were told a 15-20 minute wait but because there was only 2 of us we had the option to be seated at the bar. The staff here is super friendly no matter how busy it got. Every item on their menu looked delicious and I love the cozy feel of the place. My recommendation is the All American Breakfast. The pancakes were a dream! They were so light and fluffy and perfectly sweet I'll definitely be coming back here :) My only kink is that the food took FOREVER to come and people that ordered after us were served first.",

    "text": "I visited the newest addition to the popular Breakfast Club franchise in Canary Wharf's Crossrail Place during their soft launch on Saturday the 2 May 2015 with my boyfriend. We have eaten at their Spitalfields location several times over the past couple of years, enjoying their American inspired brunches and the charm and nostalgia entrenched in the BC brand. The d\u00e9cor ranges from the famous 'Bacon Rolls' neon sign to memorabilia that anyone who was born or lived through the 80s can appreciate (He-Man? Check. My Little Pony? You bet.) The environment is cool, the music is loud and the waiting staff are appropriately aloof and disillusioned. The menu presents a good variety of solid brunch options from pancake stacks (with real maple syrup on the side) to the Full Monty (Bacon, sausage, black pudding, eggs, home-style fried potatoes, mushrooms, beans, grilled tomato and toasted multigrain bloomer) with a 'Reggie the Veggie' vegetarian counterpart. There are butties, omelets, eggs Benedict and healthy muesli on offer as well.The BC is notorious for spiraling queues of bleary-eyed teenagers and hipsters, so we made a reservation (always recommended with this chain) and strolled past the queue to be seated upstairs immediately. The Canary Wharf branch has a bar area and some tables downstairs, but the main restaurant is on the second floor. There is a good amount of cafeteria style seating with booth seating available. All of the problems we encountered during our meal were either typical to the BC or can be attributed to the soft launch, namely: music randomly cutting out, languid and inattentive service, no waiter in sight for water/drinks refills, overcooked eggs and slightly cold food delivered. However, based on my experience with the Spitalfields branch, some of these things are typical of the chain because it is a victim of its own success- we previously had issues with inattentive staff and speed of service because waiters are run off their feet.Despite this, the food is generous and the BC is undoubtedly a consistent winner when it comes to brunch- on this visit, my boyfriend had the Full Monty and was pleased with his dish; it's the perfect cornucopia for the indecisive who desire every breakfast staple in one place. The pancakes are consistently good here, coming out fluffy and perfectly golden every time. Real Canadian maple syrup is provided in a separate ramekin on the side- this is a pointless flourish for Canadians like me, who immediately pour it over everything and then look for the full bottle. However, my English boyfriend resolutely safeguarded his eggs and sausages from any sweetness and didn't use the entire portion provided to him (philistine!).My Eggs Royale arrived as two poached eggs slathered in hollandaise and decorated with a sprinkling of chilly powder, bouncing on large muffins with smoked salmon spilling out of the sides. The portion of salmon was good, the hollandaise was as expected and the muffins were floury and filling. I am extremely finicky about poached eggs and found my eggs to be both cold and overdone- one was still only just runny while the other was a solid yoke. I acknowledged that I couldn't tolerate a further wait to rectify this issue and begrudgingly tucked in.We are hoping that most of the crowd had travelled into this branch of the Breakfast Club specifically because of the soft launch discount on food, as it would be nice to have a quieter incarnation of the restaurant for spontaneous brunching. Despite the blips experienced during our meal, I do like the BC and it's the perfect environment to relax in on a Sunday morning with a young, hip crowd. The food is good value, the portions aren't stingy and they offer some great food combinations that sets them apart from other brunch hotspots in London. They also have an extensive menu that will cater to everyone's tastes.It's worth a trip to see for yourself, but expect a long queue and paced service- make sure you order a jug of smoothie or a large coffee while you wait for your food to arrive, but at least there's a lot of kitsch on the walls to keep you entertained while you wait.",

    "text": "I have been to breakfast clubs before, I get and understand the design of the places. The focus is on high quality breakfasts in small venues with limited staff. It's not unusual to see large queues to these places snaking around the corner as people patiently wait for a griddle breakfast to start their Saturday. This really doesn't work in Canary Wharf though given we have jobs to get back to. It took me three attempts to get a table here, I know I can't blame them for being popular- they have just opened. I can blame them for being chronically understaffed, like their other venues, which is presumably to make it as profitable as possible. Anyway the food! The menu at this BC is a bit more limited than the others, despite being larger. No French toast for some reason. Our table tried the full monty (fry up), the half monty (smaller fry up), huevos al benny (eggs benedict with chorizo and avocado) and chorizo hash browns. The food was pretty disappointing. Whilst the quality of the individual ingredients was decent, they were poorly put together meals. Whether it be the muffin on the eggs benedict being like a rock, the hash brown being soggy and undercooked or the fry ups just being a bit dry and bland - the cooking wasn't very executed. \u00a0For a ten pound fry up you would expect a bit of excitement on your plate but there wasn't even anything like black pudding or a fried slice. The sausage was rather nice but then again, how do you mess up a sausage if it's good quality?All in all a disappointing breakfast made worse by the hurdles I had to jump through to eventually dine there. I would highly recommend \"Docklands Diner\" nearby instead.",

I got the Huevos Al Benny with fried chicken. It's two poached eggs served with avocado, choice of chorizo or fried chicken, peppers, and hollandaise sauce, on English muffins. Eggs were perfectly runny and the hollandaise sauce makes perfect sense. The fried chicken was crispy but lacked flavor as did the avocado and peppers. Overall the dish could use more seasoning. Also got a side of fries to go with my meal but the portion was small. The highlight of brunch was actually the free arcade game machine by the stairs. My friend and I definitely spent a good 20 minutes here on a 1v1!",

I explained that we had a reservation. I was told that they have no record of our reservation but if we wanted we could go to the bar in the back and order apps they would be able to accommodate us... So, the kitchen is closed... but we can order apps from the kitchen....? Didn't make sense, but we were hungry, so we headed to the back. The kitschy d\u00e9cor which we found left a lot to be desired. It looked like it hadn't been dusted in years... Perhaps that's the look they were going for? I don't know. When we attempted to order apps and drinks the bartender said that we missed last call, and the kitchen was closed... It was only 9:15 at the latest at this point. Very frustrating. I felt like I was on a hidden camera show and the joke was on me.... Waste of time!",

He was very attentive to my girlfriends restrictions and helped her find something delicious. He checked up on us several times. I appreciate excellent customer service. Ambiance is great!",

    "text": "Very very average because of the poor QUALITY of the food and the ingredients. Full English was very bland bordering on unpleasant! It was made with no love whatsoever, certainly on the tastebuds front. Awful and overpriced springs to mind. And similarly were my partner's American pancakes. The bacon tasted cheap and industrial. Same for the eggs (over cooked) and sausage. The setting is pseudo London cafe in the 60s but I'd rather have a real greasy spoon if the food is better. The Ledger Building (a Wetherspoon pub) just 10 minutes away is arguably five times better in terms of taste. And I'm just trying the Docklands Diner so I'll let you know.",

I had a breakfast sandwich (was missing the avocado but did not mention it) and it was good as well. Good size portions. We both had filtered coffee and got refills for \u00a31(which is not common here). The waitress was delightful. We were with a group of 13 and she was very accommodating. Highly recommend",

    "text": "This is the latest outpost of the BC chain, and big enough inside that you should avoid the dreaded queues of the city sites. We were looking for a fairly speedy dinner in the area before heading to the nearby Cineworld, so decided to try it out.By a stroke of luck we made it 15mins before their 5-7pm happy hour ended, so I went for a Rosie and Gin cocktail for \u00a35. I was torn between a few things on the menu (always a good problem to have!) but eventually went for the buttermilk fried chicken burger which was really tasty, a good size and held together well. I liked the spicy jalapeno coleslaw in with the chicken which gave it a good kick, and it was served with skin-on fries. My date had the chilli bowl, which I think he enjoyed but looked a little rice-heavy from my perspective across the table.As always they've gone all out on the retro decor - this one is more evening-orientated than others, like a 60's social club that I think does actually have live acts some evenings. I do love dedication to a theme so obv it works, sealed by the gigantic shiny disco ball suspended over the entrance staircase. I thought the service could have been a little more attentive considering they weren't very busy on a Tues eve, but both our servers were very friendly and welcoming (once we got their attention). Overall you know what you're getting with BC - and this one executes it well :)",
