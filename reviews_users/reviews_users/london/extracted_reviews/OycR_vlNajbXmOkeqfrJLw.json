To be fair they plied us with drinks whilst we waited but if we had been on our way to the theatre we'd have been in trouble. \u00a0 Enjoyed the food enough to make up for that hence the 3 stars.",

Needless to say I have struggled, however last weeks event showed me that I don't need to live in Asia Pacific to sample the delights of Japan. Under the grey skies of London's Southbank, the bbq roared and the salivating passers by could only but look on at the lucky group who sampled the delights.Sadly due to my late arrival, thanks work, I didn't get the chance to make my own sushi, however I did make it in time to see the delicate hands of our host showing us how it's done, and as a former cocktail barman I was delighted to sample the delicious sake cocktailsand a Japanese beer is always welcome.It was clear to see the passion and dedication to providing an authentic experience and the whole evening was both educational, inspirational and satisfying.The team really made us feel welcome and left me hungry to taste more from the menu.",

Silla's (the owner of Feng sushi) passion for what they do really shone through and their commitment to sustainable fish is admirable. The fact that even someone as cack handed as me managed to turn out reasonable looking sushi rolls is testament to the brilliance of this class. I would definately recommend trying one of their sushi making clases and impressing the hell out of your friends with home made sushi the next time you throw a soiree! And if it all goes horribly wrong the Feng Sushi delivery service will save you, shh they'll never tell that it was them who made it ;-)My favourites were the crab, avocado and mayo, a classic combo that really works in a sushi roll and the salmon nigiri topped with beautiful pea shoots, that was almost too pretty to eat. Almost.I have to say the BBQ was a bit too salty for my taste but I have really cut down on my salt so I think that is just my personal opinion and certainly one that did not seem to be reflected by others around the table!",

The event was held in the outdoor section of their restaurant and was split into a number of events:- Preparing Sushi dishes and watching the methods of intricacy involved in delivering these mouthfuls of pleasure. Bonus was eating the left over ingredients, the Devon crab claw meat was top notch. All food created on the day was packaged up to take home, which my girlfriend appreciated.-Cocktails: these were more Japanese themed drinks created by the staff and based around Apple and Cucumber with Sake of course. They were sublime, the sort of drink to enjoy on a Sunday afternoon.-Japanese BBQ: A fantastic selection of skewered meats they had marinade in their sauce mixtures \u00a0lamb, pork and chicken wings were kept sizzling with salted water and a little sake of course. I strongly recommend trying their sushi making classes, of course you also end up with a takeaway of the freshest sushi.",

    "text": "As I live pretty much round the corner, I've eaten at Feng Sushi a couple of times before, but for laziness sake I seem to keep getting waylaid by the comforts of Ping Pong next door. It was jolly nice to be jolted out of the laziness by last night's wonderful Qype event, which took us outdoors to make sushi, drink cocktails and sushi canapes and enjoy a bloody great barbecue. There was terrific schadenfreude to be had in watching all the hopeful passers-by sidling up to the barbecue, salivating, then mournfully going away again on hearing it was a private event. On the bright side, the barbecue is here for the whole summer, so there's plenty of opportunity to try what we did: pork, lamb and excellent chicken wings. My favourite barbecue tip was to take a giant spray bottle filled with 25/75 salt/water to dampen the flames and crisp up the meat. Our chicken was so unbelievably light and crispy that it could have escaped from an advert. There was another bottle filled with sake too, hurrah! We tried two cocktails; a sake sangria and an apple and ginger one. I wouldn't order those myself. The sake was completely overwhelmed by the flavours, and tasted much better on its own. I was very taken with the bottle Kirin and Asahi beers, not least because Kirin always makes me think of the Famous Five. Delicious! I was incredibly surprised by how easy it was to make sushi (although not so easy to make it look as presentable as it does in the restaurant). It feels like I've learned a wonderful secret, and I can't wait to get my own little rolling mat, seaweed, sticky rice and ingredients and get cracking with a very sharp knife. Above all, it was really lovely to hear about all the sustainable fish (Devon crab was delicious) and to see such experience sushi chefs preparing sashimi and nigiri up close. It took our chef maybe five seconds to make the most perfect nigiri - unbelievable. Wonderful food and passionate, friendly staff. A terrific evening in a great location.",

It was really great to learnt to make the normal sushi roll as well as an inside out version. We were then served cocktails and learnt a few secrets on BBQ Japanese style. The chicken yakitori are just awesome and those cocktails are dangerous! It was such a great time and the company was just sooo much fun!

    "text": "Long English evenings, sitting by the river. What more can you wish than a delicious and healthy barbecue with good company? I recommend the outdoor barbecue of Feng Sushi, smell wafting on the summer breezes, setting sun catching the glistening marinade, passers-by licking their lips. In the breaks from summer jobs past, I enjoyed sitting in cafes in Paris and watching the world walk by while chatting with friends, and I love the great street cafes of Bangkok where the food moves so fast that its fresh and tip-top tasty, whatever the surroundings look like. I wish that it would catch on in London. Last week I found it had.I was one of lucky Qype reviewers to get invited to learn about Japanese barbecuing. The evening started with a class in making sushi, which all looked as if they enjoyed (check out the other reviews, I arrived a bit late for that one). The knife work was impressive and it was excellent to watch new sushi materializing in seconds, full of fresh ingredients such as sesame, crab, salmon. Closer to my territory, we began with the cocktails, and maestro Mitch made refreshing Japanese twisted cocktails with a Japanese spirit called shochu which is somewhere between wine and vodka, apparently around 25% abv so not too strong, but teh effect creeps up fast, and sake sangria. The banana essence was a strange flavour, but the spirit was moving. The ginger and other spicy flavours could have been stronger for me, but the cocktails will change from day to day.Also up was King Dave, lord of the barbecue, who applied special care and delicate touch, backed with deep knowledge to ensuring one of the best braais I ever tasted. First, if you want to barbecue on wooden skewers you have to soak them for a long time first (I got that wrong last time I tried and the skewers caught fire). I have never been a fan of chicken wings, but he only took the middle section and put a few on 2 skewers. One trick is to spray with salt water and also with sake, another is to barbecue quite a lot before you add the yakitori sauce, the result delicious, succulent, crispy, melt in the mouth, flavour burst.. (no its not the cocktail talking). Also great from the barbie was shitake mushrooms (sorry vegetarians, I couldn't resist raiding), lamb and tuna, grilled and sauced to perfection.It was also great to chat with MD Silla Bjerrum. I have boundless admiration for people who run their own flourishing businesses and still enjoy life, and she is one. I loved the picture of this Danish woman, teacher of Japanese cooking, and giving classes worldwide, including beautiful Zanzibar. She talks with passion about sustainable sourcing for food and you learn a lot about it at Feng Sushi. If you are what you eat, you want to make it great, green and something to be proud of.Thanks for the great company too, fellow qypers!I can much recommend for a pre theatre lite bite or a tasty evening meal when you don't want to get heavy, and sushi is great for a takeway espeically if you are working and what stamina and liveliness for a few more hourse. Barbecue at Feng Shui is the perfect South Bank outdoor food experience, on Thur-Sun noon to 9pm until 4 September, except if weather bad. Check it out.",

Once in to this small, cafe style place we were slightly daunted by the comprehensive menu and over-eager waitress who wanted our order within seconds. We were able to placate her into giving us a little longer and then suffered the pain of attempting to catch her eye for about twenty minutes before getting served. Still, once the Bento box and Salmon rolls arrived they were pretty fresh and tasty. Going for sushi with someone who won't eat raw fish is always an odd one but luckily the fishcakes were plenty tasty to keep her full (and I wondered why I couldn't remember much about them.) It's a fine place for a quick, light and reasonably priced meal before going to see something at the Southbank centre.",

Thinking I'd just have a drink and get something to eat later, I was a bit surprised to be tempted in to ordering after just a quick glance at the menu. The reason for my quick switch in mood? Mock duck pancakes. It's funny, you'd think more places would offer a veggie version of this much-loved dish - how hard could it be? Some tofu / quorn / stir fried veggies in a sauce wrapped up with cucumber in a paper thin pancake = job done. But Feng Sushi is one of very few places who have made the effort, and for this I love them. Their filling was of the soya variety I believe and was just the right texture for a satisfying chew, the sauce was rich and delicious and though the dish wasn't exactly cheap at \u00a37 that gave me eight pancakes and was the perfect pre-gig meal; fairly light but filling. As for the place? It was jam packed but the staff - especially the super organised, gregarious manager - were smiling and very efficient. I will certainly return for a more leisurely meal some time soon.",

From the sustainable salmon on the nigiri we devoured, the scallop maki to dive for (hand dived of course), to the devon crab we used to make our inside out california rolls; all are locally and responsibly sourced.To help us wash all the sushi down, mixologist Mitch, then shared with us a couple of their summer concoctions which contained Sake and Sochu \u00a0dangerously delicious, especially for a school night!And then there was the BBQ. With street food vans and barbecued meats taking London by storm this summer, it would be rude of Feng Sushi not to jump on board given their idealic location by Festival Hall, and yakitori being a Japanese staple. With David at the helm of the drum BBQ's, he showed us the art of skewering chicken wings (only using the middle joint), and divulged a couple of secrets too which ensured perfectly flavoured yakitori every time!Feng Sushi (South Bank) will be running their BBQ on the Festival Hall Terrace every Thurs-Sun from noon until 9pm this summer (weather permitting).For full review and pictures, please go to gourmetbelly.wordpress.c\u2026 x",

The sushi was wasn't great either, dryish and bland but not cheap enough to be excused, and it's difficult to see how an average spring roll can justify a \u00a38 price tag. The toilet wasn't particularly clean, it took three times of asking to get a glass of tap water, and, for some reason, none of the wait staff looked like they particularly wanted us there. The two stars were for the sustainable fish thing - beyond that, unfortunately (and even though we'd really want to give it more) there was nothing else to recommend about our dinner at Feng Sushi.",

It makes the sushi warm and when you add the sweet and sour sauce they have it elevates the roll to another level. I mean really. It's not even really sushi, it's like a completely different thing. Cold sushi is amazing anyway, but a tempura sushi roll is a whole nother beast. When you take a bite the crunchiness is sooooo good and the sweet and sour sauce is also really unique but compliments the roll so well. I love it oh so much! So. I like the tempura rolls at Feng sushi, but I also had their katsu vegetable curry (also delicious, with sweet potato and aubergine) and their avocado roll. Very fresh, very yummy. The service is also nice and attentive. Well done! I'll be back.",

The gyoza was way over fried and the vegetarian filling was not that tasty.I hope they change some things because they have such a great location and the interior decor was nice.",

    "text": "I am an avid sushi lover but had some reservations after my Feng sushi encounter. I was at a work function when we ordered their corporate meeting platter. That is the first good thing about this place. Others include: online ordering, delivery, several locations, special diet considerations (vegetarian & gluten-free), and so on. However, I just wasn't all that impressed with their sushi. We had a wide range of Maki rolls, sachimi and nigiri. The maki rolls were simply not impressive. They seemed pretty run of the mill. This could partly be due to some of the more generic choices we opted for to appease everyone. Some of the fish tasted like it could have been fresher. Overall the food just seemed to lack in authenticity. However, I have been to a couple sushi places where I have had a bad encounter only to go back and be pleasantly surprised- so I try not to been too final in the judgement of my initial sushi encounters. I enjoy spicy, authentic sushi and plan to go back and try Feng sushi again. Maybe even stop in their stores instead of getting delivery.At this point - I didn't have the best experience with Feng sushi but the verdicts still out.",

Atmosphere: \u00a0 Light, airy, clean, with some high stools and long tables, and a few more regular sized tables.Food: \u00a0Hit and miss. \u00a0 My favourite of the evening was the hake fish tempura dish. The tempura was delicate and not greasy, served in a nicely sized portion. \u00a0Salmon spring rolls were fresh and flavourful. \u00a0Maki rolls and nigiri were simply disappointing. The Mean Tuna roll was not mean at all, not even slightly disgruntled.....it simply wasn't spicy as they should be, generally pretty bland. \u00a0So...I eagerly awaited more food to be brought, only to be further let down. The bits of nigiri were disappointing, small pieces of fish that did not scream fresh and delicious as good sushi should. Definitely not worth the price.On the positive side, staff were quite pleasant and attentive. Next time I'm in the area however I'll have to stave off any sushi cravings and go elsewhere.",

(good thing i like instant noodle)It took them twenty minutes to come out and tell us that their fryer is broken and they can't make cooked food. People who ordered the lunch menu bento boxes all had to switch their order to some other bento boxes that didnt come with cooked food. $14 quid for a tiny plate of 8 nigiri.This is for tourists, not for regular people.",

Not even. So for that, I'm going to give it 3 stars. I always have a good time here, but I think it's because I'm so happy to be having sushi that I always brush away the little things. Which is why I'm writing this review a day later... and with my sobriety cloak!Miso soup was ok, not the best, but not the worst; it could do with a bit more miso, seaweed, and tofu inside. The sashimi platter was adequate, the salmon being perfectly fine, the tuna average, and the scallolps sometimes underwhelming. We had the tempura tuna roll, which actually was pretty good, and was ordered twice.The spicy tuna roll, is a) not spicy, and b) pretty boring... don't bother. They use kimtchi to spruce it up, but that doesn't really add any value.The chili edamame is a good starter to share. Don't bother with the 'fake unagi' rolls. Completely not worth it and not where close to the taste of unagi. I understand the sustainable angle, but then just don't offer it.The beer was cold which was a +.2nd time here... it's never bad, but it's never superb. Price is around 40 pp with booze.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ seafood, not miso, soup+ rice for donburi was yummy+ nicely-decorated- pricey- flavours could be underwhelmingI was treated to lunch here and not having to fork out for my own food may have prejudiced my review upwards slightly! Having made that disclaimer...I had the winter special salmon donburi which came with salmon prepared three ways (sashimi, smoked, and 'crispy') plus a small dollop of ikura (fish roe). I must admit I only noticed two methods - cooked and raw. The cooked salmon was under-seasoned, but the sashimi was fresh and the fish roe tasted like they should.The rice was the Japanese sticky rice mixed in with seaweed which I enjoyed (unlike some London restaurants claiming to sell Japanese food but use long grain white rice). The dish also came with a wasabi mayonnaise which I was disappointed by because it tasted like normal mayo without much of a wasabi hint.My meal also came with a small soup which I had initially thought to be miso, but as I tucked into the warm broth I found small clams and seafood bits which was a pleasant surprise.The restaurant itself is tastefully decorated and was well lit from the large windows. It felt roomy despite being quite a small venue, although that could have been because I was there Monday lunchtime and there weren't very many visitors at that time. Overall, it's an OK restaurant for the location since the area is now filled with mostly chain restaurants. It's a nice place to sit and have a Japanese meal if you are in the area and fancied Japanese food, but by no mean is it an outstanding Japanese restaurant in London.",

    "text": "** Overall Score: 2.80 (B-/B)** Verdict: Decent fusion Japanese food, but very expensive.[AMBIENCE]* Ambient Volume: B. We visited Feng Sushi at about 5.45pm, and there were already several customers in the restaurant. It was not difficult to carry on a conversation.* Decor and Lighting: B. There isn't much to say about the decor. It was simple and modern, and there were only about 30 seats. About half the seats were arranged canteen-style along a long wooden table. Several LCD screens lined the walls, reminding customers that the seafood was sustainable.* Cleanliness: B.[FOOD]We ordered the following:1. Spicy Cuttlefish Noodle Soup, with soba (\u00a38.25)2. Seared Tuna, 6 slices (\u00a311)3. Seared Yellow Fin Tuna, 6 slices (\u00a310.75)4. 12-piece Salmon and Tuna Box (\u00a315)5. Bottled Water (\u00a34)* Deliciousness: B. Feng Sushi serves fusion Japanese food, so do not come here for a traditional Japanese meal. The food was somewhat above average, but it was lacking in some key areas. The seared tuna (\u00a311) -- on the seasonal menu -- came with an avocado puree and yuzu caper dressing, which was quite good. The seared yellow fin tuna (\u00a310.75) on the regular menu was dressed with a crust of black and white sesame seeds. While it was not exactly delicious, it was certainly quite nice, and contrasted well from the other avocado-dressed seared tuna. On the other hand, the spicy cuttlefish soba was disappointing. There was not enough shitake mushroom, and the peppers and chilli overwhelmed the taste of the soup. Furthermore, the cuttlefish was unusually tough. The salmon and tuna box came with 3 salmon and 3 tuna nigiri, and 3 salmon and 3 tuna maki. It was mediocre.* Freshness/Cleanliness/Variety: B+. The sashimi (both tuna and salmon) was reasonably fresh.* Presentation: B. The items we ordered were quite nicely garnished and decorated. However, the bowl of cuttlefish soba had its sides stained with numerous oil drops -- while it did not affect the taste or quality of the dish in any way, it could have looked better.[SERVICE]* Attentiveness: B-. We arrived with a Toptable reservation, so we were seated promptly. The waiter who served us was quite forgetful, however. We initially wanted the Sake Marinated Salmon (\u00a39), but he had to check its availability. Apparently he forgot, and came back to us ten minutes later asking for our orders.* Friendliness: B-. The waiter appeared distracted while serving us, and kept looking in the direction of other customers. We requested for water, and he brought us bottled water (\u00a32 each) instead of tap water without clarifying with us. By the time he brought the bottles of water and opened the bottles, it was too late. * Time to Order: C. There were not many other customers around, and we did not place any particularly complicated orders. Still, it took a good 25 minutes before the seared tuna and cuttlefish soba arrived. Service was slow.[VALUE]* Portion Size: B+. Japanese food comes in small portions; Feng Sushi served the correct portions.* Prices: C. Given that sashimi was only slightly above average and that this seemed more like a cafe than a proper restaurant, it was certainly an expensive meal -- \u00a349 for two people. The only redeeming factor was that we used a LivingSocial voucher which saved us \u00a325. That aside, prices could have been better.{Scoring Guide: A - Outstanding; B - Average; C - Below Average; D - Terrible}",

This oriental mini-venue is well suited to a relaxed and cultured pre-concert dinner, small friendly groups and sustainable sushi maniacs.And the sushi is good \u00a0after eating here as a punter many times, a few nights ago I was lucky enough to meet one of the co-founders at a Qype event held recently at the South Bank branch. The formidable Silla is big on sustainability and seasonality, and also served us delicious mouthfuls of accomplished modern maki and japanese bites, along with a surprisingly tasty cucumber ginger shochu cocktail.Many different kinds of fussy eater are catered for at this place (although when it's pointed out to me I always say I'm not fussy, I'm discerning):For the pub-grub lover:-chow down on japanese-style fish and chips (tempura fish and a mixture of conventional and sweet potato chunky chips \u00a0oh, and the chips are cooked PROPERLY)For the vegetarian:-feast upon the Nippon Duck (deep fried tofu with shredded cucumber, spring onions and hoi sin sauce wrapped in a pancake) Yes, you can have it without spring onions if you like, which I do.For the health-conscious:-nibble delicately on a selection of brown rice sushi. Actually there's a lot of healthy to choose from here.In short, if you like sushi but your friends aren't fans, the modern menu allows for everyone to indulge. Lovely if you're looking for somewhere to moor your belly before weighing anchor and setting sail into the South Bank sunset.Dinner: around \u00a314-\u00a318 per person",

    "text": "It has been a life-long dream of mine to attend a sushi-making class. All the classes I have ever come across have been so expensive (or I have been so poor!) that I could never afford such a luxury - until tonight that is! This evening I was lucky enough to be one of the ten or so Qypers invited to a sushi-making class at Feng Sushi on the Southbank. The evening started with rounds of green tea and ginger beer, before we sat down and got our hands dirty with rice, wasabi and and lots of avocado! The incredibly charming and loveable manager Silla showed us how to make cucumber and avocado maki before promoting us to california roll level. Luckily she was also very patient when it came to fixing our botched attempts at rolling said sushi! After filling a box of sushi for us each to take away for lunch tomorrow, we were then shown how to slice fresh salmon - they kept the sharp knives away from us Qypers which was probably a smart move! I love love love the fact that all of their fish is sourced sustainably - it just makes so much sense. Next up was how to make the perfect Japanese-inspired cocktail (hint: lots of sake!) before moving over to the BBQ to get some tips on barbecuing Japan-style. The whole evening was lovely - Silla and her crew were so charming and thoughtful, making sure that we had every item of food and drink that we could possibly want. I am pescatarian (i.e. I don't eat meat) so the guys happily barbecued some mushrooms and tuna for me, both of which tasted divine. The food generally was incredible - my favourites were the self-made california rolls, the salmon sushi canapes we gobbled and the perfectly-cooked tuna steak. I'm so glad I found out about this place - especially as I also noticed that they do vegetarian duck rolls. I'll certainly be back to give them a try! And until then, I'll be spreading the word about their classes...",
