My friend ordered the yoghurt & lemon dip, she really liked it too. Also tried their mint tea which was very good. Service was great. My friend and I were able to stay and chat there for about 2.5 hours without being kicked out or asked to order something else, which I thought was great service. There was a line outside, so this place looks like it is pretty popular. They have a great indoors area as well as a cute outdoors area with heaters above each table so that people don't get too cold! Really liked and would be happy to go back for a more full meal.",

I think the alcoholic lemonades were overrated and spa-water-like but there's one that I cannot remember the name of (classy) but it was the first on the list and basically like a Middle Eastern Long Island Iced tea and that was delicious. Great baba ghanuj, tabbouleh, lamb kofta (my favorite), man'oucha. Atmosphere was a bit too trendy for my taste but good if you're a bubblegum happiness kind of person.",

In fairness, the food was really good (when it arrived) but they do bear the brunt of being in a tourist mecca with far too many seats for what their kitchen seem to handle.

In addition, it was served with vermicelli rice and two sauces, which supplemented the grill perfectly. Thus, I didn't have to order any additional sides.

Perhaps my palette is not used to this type of food, but the yogurt seemed to get more and more sour and the sausage bits were getting more and more salty.

Of course there were many options that stood out but this place drew us in by the smell.The prices were expectedly quite high but the amount of food for the price was fair. However, my girlfriend ordered the lamb platter and I ordered the mix platter. I wasn't happy with higher price on my platter because it was essentially the lamb platter with 3 pieces of grilled chicken added and a price of 3 pounds more. So don't be surprised if you order this and feel like you paid a quid each for some chicken nuggets. Also, the rose mint tea was just okay. Not as strong of flavor or aroma as I was hoping or expecting, especially with my throat quite sore.Otherwise, the food was great in terms of flavor and aroma. The lamb was made into a sort of sausage link with chives or onions mixed in. There was a garlic dipping sauce and a spicier curry-like dipping sauce. The pomegranate lemonade was good stuff. And for a hot London day, the frozen yogurt was perfect.",

It comes with falafel, flat bread, hummus, babaganoosh, \u00a0tabouli as well as a yummy choose pastry thing (not sure of the name) and some pickles. Even though I don't like pickles, everything else on this plate is amazing! Regarding drinks, \u00a0I tried the mint green lemonade and found it a little pulpy for me, but through a process of trial & error, I've discovered a favourite in the rose lemonade... delish! \u00a0Icey, rosey and delicious!!! \u00a0My hubby is quite partial to the chicken wrap which he says is very tender and juicy and comes with salad. Best to book in advance if you have more than two people because the line can get quite long. Service is fairly quick, particularly if everyone else orders mezzes. \u00a0Great service.

From lamb tagines to hummous platters, everything sounds (and tastes) authentic.I don't eat lamb, so I was happy to find that they had chicken as the other alternative meat. I got the chicken taouk wrap and the Lebanese style fries. I've also tried their hummous. The wrap was very flavorful and I loved the way they grilled the pita: crispy, juicy, and hot. I only wished they added more sauce and some onions for some additional crunch. As for the hummous, you can really taste the difference. It's definitely not some kind of store bought spread. With their pita bread to dip, it's excellent for sharing.The Lebanese seasoned fries? Mehh, I can skip out on those. They're more like fried potato cubes doused with some coriander. With London being famous for its chips, you can get better ones elsewhere. If you're in the South Ken area and need something to eat after a long day of enjoying the Museum District, come here!",

Nevertheless the queue is worth it (if you are a fan of Middle Eastern cuisine)! Today I tried the Fattet Lamb Kibbeh (minced lamb wheat parcels with pine nuts, warm tahini yoghurt, garnished with crispy pita & fried onions) for \u00a38.45. I liked the idea of minced lamb in wheat parcels. The lamb was good but the dish was covered in too much tahini yoghurt. I could hardly taste the flavours of the lamb. I love the chilli sauce. It was full of spice and herbs flavours. I asked for extra chilli sauce but was told by a waitress that another waitress would bring the chilli sauce to me. She said that was not her job. OK, so they have a 'chilli person'? After 10 minutes, still no sign of the 'chilli person' or my chilli sauce. So I asked a different waitress for my chilli sauce. She gave it to me in less than a minute! :)Next visit I will stick to my favourite tangines (slow-cooked casseroles served with couscous or vermicelli rice). I like both Lamb Kofta Tangine (spiced minced lamb, tomato, carrots, peppers & courgettes, garnished with mint yoghurt) for \u00a38.75 and Lamb & Prunes Tangine (tender lamb with prunes & roasted almonds) for \u00a39.25.Please note that the tables are a bit cramped and quite close together, so conversations can be easily overheard.

Unfortunately, it was shortly after we had already finished dinner with our young son. So we were actually out looking for a place for dessert. We gotten some ice cream and were looking for a place to sit and they had some chairs and tables set in the middle of the pedestrian street away from their storefront. We didn't even know they belonged to the restaurant. No one else was sitting in this area so we sat down to enjoy our ice cream. A waitress came out almost as soon as we sat down and informed us that we were not allowed to be there because we were not eating at the restaurant. Had they been busy and those tables were needed, or had there been any one sitting nearby that we might have disturbed, we would have understood, but neither was true.The whole thing left us feeling like the staff is unwelcoming and unyielding and that they would not handle us and our 17 month old son well should we return. So we won't. Perhaps they should ask themselves if enforcing their rules when they help no one and inconvenience a family is really worth losing business.",

Within the two weeks of my London summer holiday I ate there five times and was never disappointed. Don't expect any flights of gourmet fancy - just solid Middle Eastern food - and you'll be happy. Prices here are very competitive: a decent Mezze platter will cost you 10 UKP, almost a steal considering the competition in this popular residential area. The outside seating area is frugal but appealing - the inside quite as frugal, but not quite as appealing. You will have to wait in the queue to be seated, but if you're a single traveller or just two or three people you will be pointed to a table within ten minutes max. It is a popular place though - tables during peak hours (early evening in particular) will always be occupied. Later in the evening, the outside seating will close (after about 9 pm). Staff are usually very nice and welcoming - not a given at London restaurants, I can tell 'ya! I had the Mezze platter (twice), the mixed grill (twice), and the roasted half-chicken (nicely spiced), and they were all of decent quality and served reasonably quickly. I can't recommend the Middle Eastern beers, but the freshly made lemonades are certainly a good alternative. There are several small restaurants along this part of Exhibition Road. Comptoir Libanais is your best option.",

No hellos or apologies for the wait, just 'what would you like?' without a smile.My friend got the smoked salmon and eggs scramble atop a slice of brioche bread which came with some pomegranate seeds that she enjoyed alongside her tea. I went with the vegetarian meal, which had an assortment of items - chickpeas, fried egg, grilled mushrooms, tomato, haloumi, and potatoes (hash brown style) along with pita bread. It was quite the spread. I asked for it without tomatoes, but again, service was lacking. I enjoyed a very nicely made mocha with it, creamy and sweet.The ambiance lacked much at 10am but there was seating inside and out. Decor is fun and colourful. Selection is slim in terms of breakfast items but a larger menu for lunch. It was good to try something different for a Lebanese breakfast.

After a brief wait, as Baklwa tempted us from the window., we were served a complimentary refreshing lemonade made with mint, ginger and apple juice.We were seated under the awning at a sidewalk table. \u00a0I could people watch as the closing time exodus of museum visitors strolled down exhibition road in search of the perfect spot for dinner. We were surrounded by cosmopolitan diners having conversations in french, a Balkan dialect and English as they were eating tagines of fragrant spiced meats and platters of dips and mezze. This self styled \"Lebanese Canteen\" was decorated with retro 1960's advertising, with bottles of oils, wine and condiments lining the walls - we could play the fantasy of being ex-pats in 1960's Beirut, or we could just be happy that we were in a European culinary melting pot. \u00a0We shared a bottle of Lebanese red wine. The plates all came at once, overwhelming our little table with choices... a dip plate with the flattest pita I have ever seen. (a bit too flat for my taste) fried Hollumi with cured olives and tomato, A lamb, lentil and prune tagine with couscous and a baklawa sampler plate of five little squares of not too sweet goodness...It seemed to last for hours as we listened, watched, chatted and sipped the light and lively Lebanese table wine, \u00a0but soon we were strolling through the South Kensington rain, back to the hotel. \u00a0Day two in London was over.",

    "text": "A curious thing happened whilst in the UK. \u00a0Unlike in America, I was attracted to and found myself eating in chain restaurants, much of the time completely unaware of their chain status. \u00a0And you know what? \u00a0I liked them. \u00a0Perhaps chain restaurants are better in the UK or perhaps my largely negative feelings about most chain restaurants in America are wrong. \u00a0Anyway you slice it, I liked every chain restaurant I tried in the UK and Comptoir Libanais was no exception. \u00a0 Having closed down the nearby Saatchi Gallery (a must see if you're a fan of modern art) I hit up this bright, stylish cafe with bold graphics and great merch. \u00a0Upon entering I was wowed by the atmosphere: vibrant and colorful and impeccably designed. \u00a0I know their focus is Middle Eastern cuisine but the atmosphere struck me more as an amped up Mexican restaurant; sort of what San Francisco's old La Rondalla (RIP) would look like if it were rethought by a great interior decorator. \u00a0Comptoir Libanais (Lebanese Canteen, literally) has lots of artsiness and bright, shiny things to look at. \u00a0As you dine, you're surrounded by shelves full of interesting products for sale. \u00a0I rose from my seat several times to go get a closer look at the non-menu items available for purchase. \u00a0There was a namesake hardcover cookbook with large, mouth-watering photos, packaged candies, Chiclets (the gum of the Middle East), Pomegranate Syrup, and jars of artisan jams. \u00a0 My favorite were the sparkly, stylish bags/totes from Marrakech in an array of colors and sizes, adorning high and low shelves. \u00a0I didn't need a new purse but I the longer I sat there eating, the closer I came to convincing myself I did.We began our dinner with a bottle of Lebanese red wine (Heritage: Plaisir du Vin 2011, \u00a317.95): An adequate wine but not one which would fare well against most wines from other countries. \u00a0We also tried the Mira, a (green) frozen lemonade made with fresh mint, lemon, lime, and orange blossoms. \u00a0Perhaps this would taste luscious on a hot summer day but in the dead of winter it tasted more like perfume. \u00a0Not a fan. \u00a0No problem, since all was redeemed with their:* \u00a0Fresh Rose Mint Tea - pre-sweetened and satisfyingly delicious* Mezze Platter (for one, \u00a37.95) - Baba ghanuj, hommos, tabbouleh, falafelorganic lentil salad, cheese sambousek, pickles & warm pita bread. \u00a0This was a quite perfect dinner option, full of variety and wonderful flavors.* Aubergine Tagine ( \u00a37.95) - Baked aubergine (eggplant) in a rich tomato and chickpea sauce, topped with roast onions, pomegranate seeds, and fresh yogurt. \u00a0A perfect blend of rich and enticing tastes and colors. \u00a0Dinner ended with a visit to the window where there was a wide array of baklava on display. \u00a0We selected 5 assorted pieces (\u00a33.85) and our waiter threw in a couple extra treats that we'd not chosen.With its high style concept, bright clean environment, good merchandising, and bold graphics Comptoir Libanais could have overlooked the food entirely. \u00a0That the vibrant food complements the souk-inspired decor is a testimony to the strength of concept. \u00a0There was nothing not to like about good food with lots of unique colors and textures served up in a matching environment.",

The first sip sparkled with bright flavors and became the perfect complement to the cold mezze platter of hummos (their spelling!), baba ghanuj and a homemade cheese drizzled with olive oil accompanied by thin slices of warmed pita. \u00a0Delish!My less hungry friend ordered the fresh rose mint tea which came in a tiny teapot and was slowly poured into a glass teacup. \u00a0The heady aroma was intoxicating, akin to a spa aromatherapy facial. \u00a0A surprisingly very sweet tea!Dessert was a plate of baklawa (baklava), five bite-sized morsels that were variations of the phyllo dough pastry mixed with nuts and honey. \u00a0Try some!",

Falafel is a risky order, but this would be one of, if not the best falafel I've ever had, EVER. Not dry and crumbly, not soft and sticky but the perfect in-between. served on a plate with silky smooth hummus and a crunch chunky french salad filled with gorgeous herbs. The frozen Lemonade Mira might just be my new favourite not alcoholic drink, fresh lemony and minty - \u00a0that they can add to if you are feeling that way. The service isn't the fastest, and the manager who took over was very apologetic, given with less than 1/3rd full, it shouldn't have been slow at all. Sitting outside watching the world go by sipping on the frozen Mira lemonade drink is the best way for a summers afternoon to be passed.",
