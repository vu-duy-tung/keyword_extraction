But it works well -- very well trafficked indeed, and good, tasty food at a very reasonable price. Its location very close to Kings Cross also makes it useful for grabbing a bite after a long train journey.Not a destination restaurant by any means. But if you want to eat something Chinese, filling and tasty in 30 minutes flat, it's a good place to go!",

Very cheap.Service was pretty garbage: when the table next to us asked the waitress for some salt, she reached over and grabbed it from our table without so much as an \"excuse me\" or \"are you done with this?\" Listening to the way the waitress addressed these same girls... so rude.I'm from California, and this place doesn't even come close. These noodle soups were bland and boring- I hate adding soy sauce to soups, but had to do so here.The bbq pork was very fatty and not even the right color! (blasphemous) It also tasted a little weird - like it was old. ICKI suppose I would give them another try, but only if I were really really hungry and not craving noodle soup.",

The food here is on par with many of the Asian restuarants in the US which is a huge accomplishment in itself, but it comes at a pricepoint that will completely undercut any of its competitors! If you want a filling meal for a great price, there's not much more you can ask for than Chop Chop Noodle Bar, located conveniently across King's Cross. P.S. Personally I'm curious what their profit margins are (I imagine it to be paper-thin), but as a customer I can't complain at all.",

Not so quick that food is ready before you order, do allow 10 minutes whether you are eating in or getting takeaway. In fact I could not reccommend this place enough if you have 20 minutes or more before your train leaves Kings Cross station. You might stick out the carriage of the Edinburgh train with your Black Bean Chicken and rice, but trust me you will thank me for the tip to come here. It is cheap. You get what you pay for so expect big portions but not the highest quality of food. However, King's Cross is full of poor quality food so this is a good choice. All mains are under a fiver and they take credit and debit cards over five pounds. There is a good range of noodle, soup and rice dishes with seafood, chicken, beef, pork or duck for main course and starters are reflective of Thai, Chinese or Korean food. Don't forget to get a healthy juice with your mealpersonally I love the carrot juice along with a main and starter which you can eat in and leave a 15% tip for \u00a39 in total.",

This is completely no frills with the actual restaurant being pretty plain looking from the inside.The food is really great, it's pretty tasty and for about \u00c2\u00a33 to \u00c2\u00a34 you get huge plates of food. The fresh fruit juices are also really delicious.I went with my boyfriend and spent \u00c2\u00a315 on two starters, two huge meals, tea and juice - really value for money. A great place to stop by and grab a quick, friendly bite to eat.",

Luckily for me, it was only a few blocks away :) Conveniently located across the King's Cross station, this little restaurant is quick, easy, CHEAP (which is hard to come by in London), and pretty tasty. \u00a0Might I add, they give you huge portions! The Singapore Laksa was my favorite. Spicy noodles in coconut curry soup - YUM! I was full and had leftovers for the next day! The staff was pretty friendly - I guess since my friends and I became regulars at this place and often stopped by for dine in or takeaway. \u00a0CHOP CHOP, I MISS YOU!!",

Very handy for King's Cross station, they do takeaway, but be warned, the queues can be mammoth. It's that good :)",

I remember a year ago I'd come here for the kuay teow and it was good! Better than at Hare & Tortoise. The portion was huge, they had a good assortment of fishcake, char siew (bbq pork) and prawns, and it was tasty. It never quite had the wok hei (that almost smoky flavour from a well-seasoned wok) but at least it checked all the other boxes.I had the kuay teow the other day and was terribly disappointed. It was all the same ingredients but it was so bland. It just tasted like meh, uninteresting chili. Just spicy. Nothing else. And spicy because they knew that if it wasn't, people'd be like, uh this is just brown noodles that tastes like nothing?? And then there was the special fried rice. John H. I don't want to hate on you but I ordered it after seeing your review and THIS IS NOT LEGIT. AT ALL. \u00a33.80? Pretty darn good, you'd think. Except when it's soggy rice that really doesn't taste of anything. The prawns tasted like water, totally unseasoned, and I'm pretty sure they were just defrosted. I make way better fried rice. And I'd charge you less than \u00a33.80 too. It isn't that difficult to throw in some soy sauce, or even a pinch of MSG - you're a cheap chinese restaurant, you're allowed to do that yknow.On a slightly better note, I suppose the laksa is passable. It's nothing like proper laksa (again, Hare & Tortoise does a better job. Or if you want something even better, buy the Prima Taste packets from chinatown. That stuff's legit.) But at least this dish actually tastes of something and will keep you full. The fried tofu bits are pretty nomz.But really, if you want good, fast, and cheap chinese food at a place with limited service, go to Wong Kei in chinatown instead.",

These weren't really classes...I would basically head to their office to chat in English for a couple of hours, then they would pay me \u00a57000 (just under \u00a350.) It was probably the easiest, most enjoyable part time job I have ever had!Anyway, one of these Japanese lawyers introduced me to the concept of \"dirty but gooood\" places to eat. Quite often we would go and eat in Osaka after the class...sometimes it would be to posh, gourmet restaurants, but we also headed off to small, shack-like, dirty-looking but really tasty eateries in the back streets of Umeda. When I discussed this with a Chinese friend back in London, he said he thought Chop Chop should count as a \"dirty but gooood\" restaurant, so of course I went to try it with high expectations.*sigh*I'm afraid I didn't agree with my friend. Chop Chop certainly has the \"dirty\" part of the description, but I can't describe it as \"gooood.\" However, it IS cheap as chips, and was hugely popular with (manly male) students when I was at University. I suppose it is a Kings Cross institution as it has been there for sooo long! I went back in December with another friend who raves about this place. The waiter got our order wrong...but the food isn't bad considering the huge portions for the teeny price.If you need a summary without all my waffling on: \u00a0* Rude staff* Really cheap food* Huge portions* Best when you're inebriated",

A laminated menu with the list of options, including drinks, and a slip of paper to make your indications. All the food is prepared to order and I ws disappointed to not be able to see into the kitchen.However, when it arrived it was yummy! I went with the Singapore Laksa, which is a yellow curry coconut sauce with noodles, shrimp, sliced potatoes and tofu puffs. Absolutely delicious in a massive bowl, it was really warming on a cold day. Really inexpensive, even with a small bottle of Perrier, my meal was \u00a36 (~$10). They also seem to serve the usual Asian stuff too - I saw tables with fried rice and other noodle dishes.Tight seating, but that was okay with me. I would absolutely return!",

First of all, I was served the wrong dish.When they corrected it, the vegetable soup was literally hot water with a lot of hastily chopped vegetables inside. There was literally no flavour. My main course of vegetable noodles was glue-like and had copious amounts of oil.I suppose you get what you pay for - including poor service. I would not recommend.",

They charge additional for chilli sauces. The food were cold although portions were big. Obviously quantity over quality here. Cash only. Most dishes are priced in the region of \u00a35. I would rather go to a fast food restaurant than to eat here again.",
