The place was full and we didn't have a reservation but they were so kind and found us a table! The food and tea was delicious - especially the bacon ;) - and the exceptional service made eating here a great experience: Lucy, Fatimah, and Shelby are absolute GEMS. They were so friendly and funny, making our breakfast so so enjoyable! Great food, and even greater service - would definitely recommend.",

The staff was also friendly and personable. Loved it all.",

    "text": "This is a review for Cafe Bella Maria's wonderful service, cozy-unique decor, and mouthwatering cream tea!After a very stressful morning, my group of 7/8 classmates and I (studying abroad from Los Angeles) took a break from our touristy adventures at this cafe. We came in for the free wifi and shade. The antique looking tea cups immediately caught my eye. I definitely didn't expect to be so impressed with their food and service.4 girls split the afternoon tea for two, and the waitress was nice enough to give us 4 teas :) (She could probably see how thirsty and tired we were from lugging around all our bags). That really resonated with me, and I appreciate it a lot. (Thank you!!)The set came out with 2 large scones, jam, LIFE-CHANGING SWEET CREAM, 2 cakes, and 2 sandwiches. Unfortunately, the chocolatey fudge cake was dry and unimpressive. The meat sandwiches were also forgettable.However, the scones were enough to redeem everything. Warm, buttery (but not overwhelming), light, and...sconey. My mom's signature dessert is her blueberry scone, and right when I bit into Cafe Bella Maria's, I blurted out that these were the best scones I've ever had. Their sweet cream is also whipped so that it's super airy when you spread it. But what makes their cream tea unique is how perfectly the cream pairs with the fruit jam. It's not too sweet, so that you can really taste the milky-creaminess (which I love, since I love whipped cream). The jam tops it off with the fruity flavor I love on a scone. I've also tried the scones at Mock Turtle and Blackbird in Brighton, as well as Ambassadors Bloomsbury in London. They can't even compare!I've been dreaming about their delicious scones, cream, and jam since. I will be returning this weekend and bringing my friends from Scotland to try them as well. Can't wait!",

The eggs and toast were great, and the mushrooms were a standout. I also had a homemade scone with clotted cream and jam - so good - and a latte. The dining area is adorably decorated and they sell small tea-themed gifts in the front. Even if you're not hungry, grab a latte to go on your way to Buckingham palace!",

After passing up probably 5 other restaurants we happened upon Bella Maria. There was a table empty outside, so we opted for that.Service was very slow, but friendly. It took quite a long time to place our orders, get our coffees and food, and get the bill. For breakfast, I had a caramel latte and English breakfast minus mushrooms. The English breakfast was good, but a little cold, which made me wonder if it was sitting around for a bit before our server picked it up.Cute little spot that seems to draw locals and tourists alike.",

Recently, I had the opportunity to visit England with a group of fellow study abroad students. After a morning of maneuvering the many tube lines and trying to see all of the sights of the city, we all found ourselves ready for some caffeine and a snack. After seeing Buckingham Palace, we decided to get coffee at the next place we saw, which lucky for us, was the adorable Cafe Bella Maria. The ascetic of the cafe was charming between its displays of brightly painted tea pots and miniature jars of homemade jam. After the epic choice of deciding between coffee or tea, I found myself ordering a delicious latte and traditional English scone. The scone was one of the best I have had in Europe and I liked my coffee a latte. All of my travel companions were also satisfied with their orders providing raving reviews of the croissants, crumpets, and teas. We left having spent only a few pounds each making the experience even better! Stopping in a teahouse or cafe is a must when in Britain, and Cafe Bella Maria is the perfect spot to do so!",

The mushrooms in the English breakfast are especially good, and the scones were still warm when they arrived. The clotted cream wasn't my thing (then again, I don't like cream in general...) but the jam was good and my wife enjoyed it all. The decor is charming - the tables and chairs are mismatched, and there's a teapot tree in the corner. You get the impression of being in someone's living room.All of the teapots, tea cups, saucers, etc. are for sale (\u00a314 for a small teapot and \u00a319 for a large; tea cup, saucer, and dessert plate set for \u00a312).

Great place to go after visiting the Queen's Gallery. *** about the service***From the moment we walked in the blonde lady behind the calendar was very rude. She acted like she was offended we had the audacity to eat in their shop. She told us they were no longer serving food (we arrived at 4:30 and they closed at 6p). We clarified and she told us they were only serving cakes. We chose a cozy table in the back and had to wait quite 30 minutes to order although another party came in and was served by her in a prompt manor. Eventually we went up to the counter and politely asked if we could put in an order and she literally rolled her eyes at us. At this point we were ready to go somewhere else. The kind gentleman (Dan) behind the counter, who had only been working there 3 weeks, jumped in and said he would take our order. We ordered tea and scones. Another party walked in and ordered afternoon tea which included sandwiches when we were told we could only order cakes and that the kitchen was closed. Curious. \u00a0Our waiter was the saving grace that made us stay.",

I liked that we were able to sit outside and enjoy our tea, although the curb is super small and you're basically staring into the souls of those driving past, which includes massive buses lol. I purchased a few jams, which had edible glitter. SOLD! I loved 2 out of the 3 jams. The grapefruit one was too bitter for me. Pricing was good as well as service.",

It's a tiny place, but we were able to get a seat right away. The scones are the best I have ever had. Not like the scones I get in America or at Starbucks. These were small and moist and so tasty. With clotted cream and a little jam. Ugh. I had to really strain to not steal my husband's share. It came with cute little sandwiches - a ham and cheese, a tuna and corn, and a cucumber and cream cheese. Plus some bits of different cakes (banana, and a chocolate/banana, and lemon). Also a muffin (possibly some kind of ginger/spice flavour). It was such a lovely little meal. My favorite of all during our week in London. Highly highly recommend.",

The sandwiches, scones and cakes were absolutely delicious. The scone was nice and warm. The 3 different sandwiches were all very tasty and the cakes were delicious as well. The macaroons were great! We loved everything about this traditional tea. My boyfriend also ordered the cheese and ham croissant and it was warm but crispy. Everything was delicious and filling and the atmosphere made it that much better. The staff was very friendly as well. This is somewhere you have to go when visiting London!",

I wanted to try a full English breakfast while we were in London, so we ordered that and a scone (shown on their dessert menu, not food menu). The full English was a decent portion for one person, and tasted fine. I really enjoyed my scone, which came still warm, and with jam and clotted cream. If I had more time in London, I would probably come back to try their afternoon tea, or to just get more scones! NOTE: 50% off a hot drink when you check-in on Yelp!",

The avocados were hard and sour tasting. Despite it being in the middle of avocado season. They were in the middle of renovation but even that does not excuse this poor service and bad food. We were told there was no manager on duty. \u00a0when we went to pay We saw the staff reheating someone's soup because it was served cold, but they left her sandwich on the dirty tray tables. Beware.

I wanted to try English styled breakfast for myself and saw that \"The English Rose\" for short had really great reviews. I was not impressed, but maybe it's just because I didn't like the breakfast?? Not that it didn't taste good because I'm sure it does to others. For what it was.. I think it costed about $15 USD for breakfast per person.. which is a lot for what I had. :( As an American I don't like English food much... so I really just thought it was average.The food also took a little while to get to us, but the staff was very nice.",

Despite the location, I was think that this place would be expensive but it was not. For two people for an afternoon tea we spent only $17 each with a proseco, I like that it wasn't TOO overwhelming with pastries and sweets because let's be real.. who the heck can stomachs all that. We had some tuna sandwiches, the scones were amazing, cucumber cream cheese sandwiches (not so good), and their mini cakes (wasn't our favorite).",

Nice bathrooms and free WiFi (great for travelers who want to upload photos after their Buckingham Palace trip).Verdict: scones were delicious especially with the clotted cream and jam, but he tea was underwhelming. It was not one pot, it was two little pots of hot water and mugs with tea bags. For a team shop, I'd expect some loose leaf tea in a pot already steeping. Staff was super friendly, but a tea shop should do tea right, hence the three stars.Tips: go during no-peak hours.Next Time: probably try the afternoon tea for two and try the finger foods - it looks very appetizing when others around us ordered.",

    "text": "This cafe has earned a spot in my list of top five favorite breakfast places. We chose this place because it was near Buckingham Palace, not expecting anything memorable, and left with a promise to come back. For breakfast, we order smoked salmon+eggs+toast, bacon+eggs+toast, a full English breakfast, cream tea and scones, and coffee. Every single item was delicious. Granted, it's pretty hard to mess up smoked salmon and eggs, but the bacon was thick and flavorful (not just salty), the scones were warm and fluffy, and the tea and coffee were so smooth. The portions were generous enough that we were able to last past lunch time before we were hungry enough for another meal. The service was wonderful. We were greeted with smiles and our server was extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is sweetly decorated with cute, feminine touches everywhere. Definitely an insta-worthy spot. They say breakfast is the most important meal and this definitely set us off on the right foot for a 10 mile day of exploring London. Note that this review was solely about our first visit. We tried coming back right before our flight and it turned out that the chef just didn't show up that day (?!) and the replacement would be arriving after we needed to leave. The staff gave us free tea and coffee as an apology which was super nice of them. I'd still highly recommend The English Rose Caf\u00e9 based on our first experience!",

The finger sandwiches were a little bigger than expected, really more the size of regular sandwiches and the toppings were just okay (tuna salad, ham and cheese, cheese and onion), but they were tasty. The sweets were fabulous though! The Victoria sponge was amazing, the chocolate muffin was good, and the banana bread was INCREDIBLE. Very satisfied with my afternoon tea",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Sunday morning and was excited based on the good reviews. Our coffees came in ten minutes, but the service went COMPLETELY down hill after that. We watched our server place the wrong order at different tables, and after 40+ mins of waiting, our 2 English breakfast plates were still nowhere to be seen. We would've liked to order more coffee/tea during the wait but our server was nowhere. I finally went to the front counter to pay for our drinks and leave close to the 1 HOUR mark....and saw our food was just sitting behind the counter. The cashier was very sweet and apologized, saying that our food was right here if we cared to stay and eat. Fine. We sat back down at our table for ANOTHER ten mins before served. The only reason this got 1 more star was because the cashier was very professional, and the sausages/mushrooms were good.",

Small and cozy, with delicious sandwiches and soup. Friendly, unhurried service made me wish we could stay longer. Would go back the next time we're calling on the Queen.",

    "text": "I am originally from Melbourne Australia, living in Los Angeles California and am currently traveling in the UK. As you can imagine, life as a traveler can be very stressful. I had the craziest morning this morning and was looking for an internet cafe to print out a script. It seemed like my map was leading me to an internet cafe that does not exist. Instead, I ended up at this nice little cafe. I had asked the ladies who were working there if I had come to the right location. They told me that I came to the wrong place and they do not know where the place I am looking for is located, and then offered me to use their internet. I told them I needed to print something and they said they could help me print it. I ordered a soda from them as I did not have time to order any of their cakes, as delicious as they looked. If you are ever in London and want a nice place to chill over a coffee or cake, be sure to give this place a visit! Both the young ladies working there are extremely nice and helpful. Really made my morning a lot less stressful! Thank you!",

My friend and I got the tea and scones for two deal and it was \u00a35.50 which really isn't too bad. The teapot fills the teacup up to six times total. We're very happy with our experience! :) It's about a five minute walk from Buckingham Palace and close to the rest of the tourist areas.",

    "text": "In London I fell in love. She was a beautiful lady that Maria. A Bella Maria. This cafe was an amazing find... I don't love tea but I do love coffee. So my friends and I had \"coffee time\" at this darling little cafe, not once, but twice. And it would have been thrice had we stayed in London a little while longer. My first experience at Bella Maria was during off-peak hours, which meant good service. My second experience was during lunch and boy was it busy! Finding a seat was difficult, there weren't any available inside but they had two tables free outside. I had the cappuccino here twice and the first time it blew my mind but the second time it was quite horrid. I guess it was because they were so busy... or at least that's what I will keep saying to myself. I also had one of their panini's and it was spectacularly delicious. I mean, I would probably go back to London just for that panini. It seems like they were slammed during lunch and they couldn't handle the heat [no pun intended]. I think they also forget orders... like they did my cappuccino that second time. You may ask then, why are you still giving that place 5 stars? Well, because it was the cutest darned place I ever saw. The decor was phenomenal, like a sweet country home. Books on a book shelf, mixed tea/coffee cups, flower pots on the tables, and a charming glass window. I mean, I would have moved in. Anyways, I guess you may call it puppy love but I just couldn't get enough of Bella Maria!",
