    "text": "I don't often venture unto east London but Song Que's reputation drew me here out of curiosity as I had developed a real taste for pho on US trips.It must be good to stand out in an area with so many other Vietnamese restaurants. However, the tag of cafe is accurate and expect the bustly street food type atmosphere you would find in other 'oriental long table' experiences. However, service was efficient, necessary to turn the tables over with the speed that they do.OF course I had to try the famous pho and connoisseurs recommend the rare sliced steak with soup noodles. The portion was certainly generous. The steak was tender and the soup suitably meaty with depth of flavour, balanced out with basil and lime juice.The rice paper roll was suitably fresh with flavours bursting out in my mouth with the first bite.It was worth a foray into east London",

    "text": "I was hit by a gnawing pho craving this afternoon, so I did some research into the Vietnamese restaurants in London. Perhaps it's because I've been spoiled rotten by the abundance of good pho restaurants in Los Angeles, but I was seriously shocked by the lack of options. In the end, I chose Song Que after reading various gushing reviews.I made the long trek over from the Old Town tube station in the pouring rain, and the first thing the waiter did when I entered was toss my umbrella into a bin and steer me into a seat at the same table as a lovey dovey couple. That kind of threw me off -- I understand conserving space in a restaurant with the kind of layout they had, but it was 5:30 on a Monday afternoon and the place was only 1/4 full. I ordered the pho with steak, flank, and tripe. The good: decent-sized portion, well-cooked noodles. The bad: bland broth, very little meat. I'd say not bad for the price, but considering I can get outstanding pho in LA for $5, \u00a36.30 for mediocre pho just doesn't cut it. Overall, Song Que was a bit of a let down. Next time I'll try another one of the restaurants on Kingsland, or maybe a different dish off the Song Que menu.",

It is so close to Liverpool St. that we had a nice touristy walk around the area after dinner- theres a Hawksmoor nearby for a start..(no; it's not a Pub(yet)..).What restaurant? Oh yeah, Son Que. Well, I got all adventurous again with the menu, and loved Everything! (Was the rice meant to be sticky? Who cares, i'm not fussy about rice). Tried the mussels, because i don't like them and dammit, that was great too. Everthing had quite complex and subtle flavours, and i will have to try the Pho next time... the bowls are so huge i would not have been able to eat anything else. I went with a Chef from New York; and she was also much pleased with this venue. 'Nuff said- I am gonna be late for Badminton club now- Gotta go!",

    "text": "Why yes, I do say that this was some divinely slurptastic pho. But the real reason that Song Que blew me away and will keep me coming back for more was the feisty and quick witted service. Let me jump back: For years I planned to be a teacher. And wouldn't you know it, my dream was to teach middle-schoolers. (To translate, those are the painfully snotty children ages 11-14.) There's something about their innocent assholishness that I adore. Sarcastic as all get out, if you are able to gain their fleeting respect, you can probably rule the world. So long story short, I really enjoy spunk, mouthiness, and yes, a bit of a challenge from those around me. It keeps me on my game! So when our server threw back some playful attitude when I kept changing my mind on my appetizer, I knew we'd chosen the right place. When he teased us for \"living large\" and ordering an \u00a311 bottle of wine, I knew that I was already a devoted fan. And when he told us with a straight face that a to-go box would be an additional \u00a310 each, I knew I'd be back again and again.",

Song Que is NOT a BYOB!Imagine our embarrassed faces when our poor little waiter ran over to wag his finger at us for getting started on our Chenin Blanc without first checking it was ok. Ooops... CRUSHING SHAME.... he big he big, we small.To be honest he was very nice about it and let us finish what we'd poured, which was the obvious lovely person thing to do. Lovely food, lovely people.

From memory the pho was decent - quite good broth and well-cooked noodles. Vermicelli was ok and so was the pancake (could be more flavoursome, had better in a lot other places but this is the only place I've seen them in London). Also had the iced drink dessert (a bit too sweet). I liked how service was very friendly and quick. The second time was 6 months later and was a let-down. Ordered grilled pork with vermicelli. There was hardly any salad. The pork was a bit salty and nuoc nam was not tangy and sweet enough. Very disappointed. Will stick to Cafe East for vermicelli/grilled pork. Lots of people rate Song Que as one of the best Viet restaurants in London so probably just wasn't my day.",

Also would recommend the soft shell crab starter, delish. This place is always really busy around dinner time though, so would recommend making a reservation.

There were at least 3 empty tables in the room. They insisted that we park our baby and eat at a table away from him.We sat down but were unhappy with the arrangement and cust service so we left without eating.This business does not care about their customers, only that they fill their tables at max to make money. And today this wasnt eve reasonable, since they had empty tables yet to fill.Prob will not go back again.",

Btw, prepare to get cozy with your neighbors when it's really busy. You'll be sitting semi-elbow to elbow with others. Luckily, my husband and I had the pleasure of sitting next to some lovely people. We had met new friends!Other than the company, the food wasn't bad, but I wasn't impressed. We shared the sampler and I had a simple bowl of pho. I was surprised it wasn't offered with two sizes, like at most places, but it wasn't hard to finish. The sampler was okay. And the pho was okay. Nothing to rave about. But of course I'm willing to come back and try lots of other menu options! We had lots of recommendations from our neighbors and their food did look tasty!",

Some are Bring Your Own which is just perfect when in a big group no need to worry about who consumed what, you can just split the food bill! Talking about the bill, Vietnamese is extremely good quality for money. If you have a budget you can easily stick to it.Son Que is my favourite at the moment (it changes regularly) for starter's seaweed is a must and rice prawn rolls with chilli sauce! The main is always a little difficult, but the vermicelli prawn noodles and mango fish are the best. My other favourite is noodle soup - extremely tasty and filling due to the rice noodles. Great for couples, friends and parties! Just be aware food comes out randomly and they can rush you if you don't set a slow pace. Enjoy!",

    "text": "On a cold, blustery evening in...May...my sister (visiting from the US) and I were craving a hot, flavourful bowl of pho. I live quite close to the Dalston/Kingsland Road neighbourhood, yet hadn't ever been in any of the Vietnamese restaurants on that strip of the road, so we decided to give it a try tonight. Being from the Los Angeles area, where quality (and vegetarian!) Vietnamese food is pretty ubiquitous, we've been accustomed to a certain standard of this cuisine (ie, a restaurant that carries mushroom/vegetable broth at all times, and is frequented by a certain Brad Pitt, like my favourite pho joint in LA....) that I unfortunately hadn't yet found in London (maybe my standards are a bit unrealistic at this point). As a result, we were a bit dubious when entering Song Que, but our worries were soon allayed. The foodie lowdown:-There was no tofu/veggie summer roll on the menu, but we asked if the chef could make us some and it was done. The \u00a0peanut/sriracha/hoisin/garlic dipping sauce that was served with the rolls was absolutely delicious, as well.-I had checked out the menu beforehand, and there seemed to be no vegetarian pho...only a 'tofu' one. When ordering it, I asked if the broth was veggie, too; it was a good thing I did, as the standard broth for that dish was chicken, and it had to be swapped out for a vegetable one. Pretty good, overall, but (as was somewhat expected), lacking in the flavour department -- as my sister correctly pointed out, our soup ended up being a shocking bright red colour, due to all of the sriracha and chili oil that we added to it. Still, the portions were generous, the tofu and noodles cooked well, and the garnishes fresh and plentiful.-Being big aubergine lovers (and only having discovered this love in the last 5 years of life), we ordered a side of pan-fried aubergine with garlic and spring onions. We opted not to get rice, because there were already a lot of noodles/carbs in the pho, but I kind of wish we had...there was quite a lot of stir-fry sauce that went to waste, because we didn't have anything to soak it up with. Had we gotten rice, though, I might have exploded...and not been able to write this review. Be thankful.-Though we didn't have dessert or drinks, the table next to us ordered coconut water/meat that they had to return two separate times because it seemed to taste funny/potentially have gone off. The waiter helping them was getting really defensive about it, too, insisting over and over again that nothing was wrong. Eh. Regardless of who was in the right this time around, be careful with that one...In the end, we left more than justifiably full for having spent just \u00a318.80 -- what a deal. Not Brad Pitt, LA, good, but solid.",

    "text": "This locality has pho places a dime a dozen and most of them have quite the following, but I should be the president of the Song que fan club, as I belive it has the best vietnamese food on Kingsland Road. Now Song que is quite the institution, as it has been around for a while and I belive shall stick around because it is not only serves scrumptious food, but in these times of austerity is good value for money !!!The place has minimal decour as is what i would imagine a big canteen in a communist part of south east asia would look like !Ther service is good and quick and the waiters tend to remember you !Now my dear friends when you go to a restaurant that specializes in a certian type of food/cuisine I would advise you to stick to it !!!really guys when you go to a chinese restaurant you won't ask for a burger now will you !!So when you will go to Song que (and I know) you will go I advise you to order the vietnamese food !!The menu is quite dauting with its variety, but for starters stick to the spicy squid or the soft shell crab, the summer rolls are lovely and fresh, but a real Viet classic is pancake !! Get it all and share the love For the main course order the pho, which is a gorgeous soup (with an arromatic broth ) and hand made noodles and beef cuts of your choice(offal is part of that shoice)be adventerous and ask the waiter for viet specials and stay clear of their \u00a0chinese dishes, its not their food and they are not good at it !Now I must explain myself, the reason why I am harping on asking for advice and sticking to the viet dishes is because I visited a few days ago and four people sat on the table close to us and explained to their waiter that they had never had viet food and did not know anything, the waiter they got recomended afew viet specialities, but was running around. Being the good freindly samaritan that I am I gave them some recomendations and got some strange not very freindly looks, My dinner partner told me to leave them be (but i love talking and helping people, i would like others to do do that to me guys )alas that table order the chinese dishes which where oily and not nice and left miserable!!!So my dear friends what is the moral of the story ..... when in rome do as the romans and listen to kindly, freindly advise from smiling strangers !!",

    "text": "I went here based on the recommendation of a friend, who classed it 'the best place in London for Pho'. So, after getting slightly lost in some dogdy estate, we finally found Song Que. The decoration and furniture is basic and a little run down. We were shepherded to a table for four, which already had one person eating on it. I know communal eating is the new 'thing' but in a resturant only 1/3 full, this is ridiculous. Spilt for choice on the menu, we went for a beef Pho, a a vietnamese pancake with chicken & prawn and a prawn roll. This was my first time trying Vietnamese food. I've had Thai, Chinese, Malay etc, and liked them all, but this did not work for me. The pancake with chicken & prawn took up half a normal size dinner plate, but only had 3 prawns in it, and about 5 small bits of chicken. All the rest was padded out by beansprouts. Same with the prawn roll; 2 prawns and a crapload of vegatables to bulk it out. The pho was just odd to me. There was nothing wrong with it, I just didn't like the flavour, and that's my problem, not the resturants. My friend who loves pho thought this one was great, and ate it all. I would not go back here even if I liked the food, because I felt the price did not justify what you get, and the service is so poor.It's impossible to get waiters attention, they seem intent on ignoring customers at all costs. Try another Vietnamese place, and don't make the effort to come here, it's not worth it.",

In the end we arrived at 7 and were quickly shown to our table. I say quickly because the staff in here are almost obsessive about table turning and will rush you at every opportunity. Once you get used to this though the atmosphere in the place is actually friendly and although tables are squashed together and you may be sitting next to people you've never met before there is a general feeling of fun and excitement.Noodle soup is Song Que's delicious speciality and comes two sizes- a regular bowl for those who want to order a few things from across the menu and what can only be described as a troth for those who just can't get enough of that soupy goodness. There was something weirdly impressive watching people tackle this mammoth portion as the soup itself is incredibly filling. Though I would recommend it, I think it would be a shame to only try the soup and not get a taste for the rest of the menu. The soft shell crab and prawn rolls are other great dishes not to be missed out on. Great food and fun times that everyone can enjoy!",

If you like this type of food, start at one and work your way down over time. Let's face it, as far as eating goes, it's cheap as noodles - especially if you bring your own booze, so why restrict yourself to one place?Fortunately, I have lived in the area for years (yes, before it was hip and trendy - previously resembling more of a recently demilitarised zone) and have had ample opportunity to try each of these places more times than I care to remember.So, back to the Song Que. is it any good? Well, it's better at some things than others. The reason I chose to review this establishment first is that I think it has the best Pho on the block - and if you're looking for the ultimate Vietnamese dish, that is literally it in a bowl - but the soft shell crab and spicy squid (my faves) are a bit meh in my opinion (try the Tay Do for these)The ambience, in my opinion, is better suited to a lunchtime set up as is quite loud and bright but that's just a personal view. Try it for yourself and then try another one...",

I've never had that at a pho restaurant before. The pho here was good. At first the flavor was a little strange for us, just because we are accustomed to the pho on the other side of the world. But a few bites in and we really grew to like it. Good flavor and everything was in balance. We also had the spring rolls which were tasty. \u00a0Lastly, we ordered some Che Ba Mau which was probably our favorite thing from the night.

    "text": "Coming from a Vietnamese background and having been to Vietnam and growing up on Vietnamese food, I thought Song Que ranks as one of the better restaurants in London. I tried the following dishes and thought I'd give a review about them first. Vietnamese food should be simple and Song Que keeps it just that. I am a big fan of cold rolls (summer rolls) and am not really a big pho eater. I thought the cold rolls were very authentic (contained prawn, pork belly, vermicelli and lettuce). The dipping sauce was very nice and authentic too. I've tried cold rolls in most restaurants in London and I think this one comes closest to what my mum would make at home! The Vietnamese pancake was average. It was a medium portion but they forgot to bring out the lettuce that is used to wrap the pancake. I think they need to show people how to eat the pancake, otherwise no one would know what to do unless your someone who has had it before. It was tasty but they need to bring more lettuce on the side! Salt and pepper squid - very nicely deep fried, but not oily. It was very tasty and definitely looked authentic. Must try i say. Lemongrass beef vermicelli - I had this as my main and i think this dish was delicious! Good ratio of meat, salad and noodles. Some Vietnamese restaurants get this ratio incorrect, but Song Que got it right! So 5/5 for this dish! 3 coloured bean drink - yum! Aside from the decor not being very nice, the food is worth it and service is quick. But i think that's what you should expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. Well for me, it's all about the food! I",

    "text": "Featured on Time Out London's top 50 restaurants, reviewed by Fodor's - a top travel guide, and obtaining an overall user rating of 9.3 on London-Eating. Need I say more? Frankly, I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first time I have come across this place in my four years in London. This will be the one place that rolls off the tip of my tongue from now on if I'm asked for my recommendation of a good Vietnamese restaurant. And among other Asian restaurants that I frequent, this ranks near the top for its quality and value for money. After a nice lengthy stroll from Old Street Station to get the appetite up, the place initially disappoints on decor. Walking in there is certainly a homely feel, although the warmth doesn't seem to be there. The walls are plain, and the lighting is somewhat dim, giving off a very sterile impression. However, overall it is a clean place with ample space and fast service. The menu consists of mostly Vietnamese and some Chinese and other Asian food. Pho, the noodle broth dish, is clearly their speciality with over 20 different kinds. For the adventurous, there are the traditional ones with beef, tripe, and other cow parts. For the less adventurous, there is the standard rare steak (just thin strips of beef that are just cooked) or strips of chicken. As you can see in the picture above (credit to Tasty Treats @ Wordpress), the noodles come in massive bowls, with ample portions of rice noodles, beef, and beansprouts. And for \u00a36ish you can't go wrong either! We ordered the fried spring rolls (\u00a34) for the starter, which were very tasty. What impressed us most was that they also served homemade soya bean milk, which is the first time I've seen it in London. It is well worth the \u00a31.30, as making fresh soya bean milk involves alot of energy and time, and even in South East Asian countries many restaurants have stopped making it as it is just not worth the effort. Extra kudos to Song Que! Although our experience was nice while we were at the restaurant, half an hour later after leaving both my friend and I started getting dry mouths, a symptom of MSG and other flavoring ingredients. To be honest if was one of the worst dry mouths I've had after a meal in London, with most restaurants very ethical about not using too much of it.",

    "text": "Asked around where can I get a good pho, my Londoner friend hyped up this place and brought me here.The first item I take on a road test at any Vietnamese restaurant is its pho, a main staple food. I give the pho here a passing grade, certainly not the best I've had, and not the worse I've had. I will pay for good food. I've asked for 2 pounds extra worth of pho, but I received what looked like a regular sized bowl of pho laced with children's portion of beef. This is, after they've attempted to give me someone else's order twice whilst nicely overcharging me 2 pounds more for an already overpriced for what you get bowl of pho. The broth was mediocre. Perhaps if my friend didn't hype it up, I wouldn't be as disappointed.Of course, people don't come here for the customer service (definitely lacking in the friendliness and promptness of delivery, but hey, this is a 'come here to eat good food and then leave asap' place), so don't complain. At the end of my meal, the server was taking away plates and bowls of soups over my head, to which I nicely asked him if he could do this not over my head as it was making me nervous of spillage, and I explained especially since I only had one jacket traveling in town and I was wearing it. He waved off my request in annoyance but did manage to find an alternative route to taking away additional plates... :-) Just remember one does not get \"the customer is right\" here... it is please sit, order asap, eat quickly and get out so we can get another paying customer in here immediately. If you can understand this mantra, you and this restaurant will get along fine. It's an ideal place to grab something quickly and not for a Friday night rendezvous. Oh and the decor... it's all green with a touch of shrimp symmetry. I know symmetry is good for decoration, but I'm really not sure about the two large symmetrical shrimps hanging over the bar. \u00a0Maybe if they added Little Mermaid, the crayfish and Nemo, we could really have a fun time there... ugh.I also ordered the shrimp rolls, it received okay marks.There has got to be a reason why people still flock here despite the lack of customer service and its desperate need of an interior designer. Please, don't tell me it's the pho! Since I sat next to other people, I scanned at what they ate. The people who sat on the left with me ordered some very interesting looking dishes and even chatted with me at the end - so there is friendliness here, just not from the wait staff! Their grilled beef wrapped in grape leaves looks/smells superb and is definitely good for sharing. My vegetarian friend swears by their pancake and happily gobbled his down without sharing (He's like Joey Tribbiani of Friends - don't like sharing food). If you come here to try something - feel free to ask friendly patrons sitting next to you or look around to see what others are having before you order... and be pho-warned, you know my take on the pho already.",

That just about sums it up. \u00a0As some of you may know from my other reviews - I do a different Pho every month with two of my girlfriends here in London. \u00a0This one I actually did on my own, following a workout @Frame_Shoreditch and on my way home via Kingsland Road. \u00a0I tend to get easy distracted by stickers touting \"Yelp Loves us\" \"Timeout recommends\", etc. you know the drill - and Song Que has these plastered everywhere. \u00a0Additionally, the restaurant was pretty full so I figured this would be a good sign. I chose the pork and prawns Pho.Food: Meh - Lots of brown and noodles stuck together - 3 prawns and 3 things of pork. Not impressed. The food came out pretty quick - probably because they wanted the woman in a track suit eating alone with her International Herald Tribune to get moving! With all the other great choices along Kingsland road my only suggestion: look elsewhere. \u00a0Service: Like I said quick, but not friendly. \u00a0The younger servers were attentive enough, the older ones just grunted at me a bit when I asked which table I should seat myself at. \u00a0When it came time to pay, I asked for the bill and before I could lift my wallet from the table, they were already cleaning up the table and sending me out.

The smooth and silky beef tendon and tripe benefited from the broth greatly and it was a bowl full of beef goodness. You can treat Song Que either as a quick grab or a proper dinner joint due to its extend long menu that suits both occasions, however it is a cafe at the end of day so don't expect any fancy services and it can get very busy in the evening with a no booking policy.",

I have to say this was my most disappointing meal of the year considering the recommendations.I'm a fan of Mien Tay and am shocked that it is not frequented to the same level. The food is considerably better. Song Que left me with bland flavours, poor service and a feeling of hunger despite the several courses four of us devoured. That all preceded a bill of magnitude which I've never seen at a place in 'Little Hanoi'. Perhaps it was poor ordering, but I don't think I can recommend this at all. The daylight style evening lighting was shocking too. Thoroughly disappointed.Despite Mien Tay removing their BYOB policy, I would go there over Song Que. eurgh",

Crowd annoying. \u00a0Hype impossible to understand. \u00a0 Would be good for a takeaway.",

This is a no frills, no fuss kind of eatery, and wouldn't look out of place if you plopped it in the middle of Southeast Asia. The walls are painted a horrific bright green and someone took things to the next level by gluing on giant ceramic lobsters, but that's what I love about Song Que. It's not trying to fit in and the food is pretty gosh darn good too.Song Que's pho is solid, but my favourite dish is their #60, which consists of grilled and shredded pork, and spring rolls on top of rice vermicelli. It's crispy, it's crunchy. It's salty and sweets. It's downright delicious. The best part? This big ol' bowl of food will set you back less than a tenner. If you come to Song Que expecting British-style service and fine dining, you're going to be disappointed. That's not what this restaurant is about. Come here for quick, cheap, and tasty Vietnamese food and you'll walk away satisfied.",

The starters are a little deep fry heavy and it's not quiet as fresh as I like viet foods to be but there is a serious amount of veg and herbs all through the menu. Really large serving sizes and two types of sriracha hot sauce for you to chose from on the table. The menu is huge so you have to decide if it's a sharing night or a solo soup night. The soups are comforting and filling and full of flavour. Highly recommended (unless celery isn't your thing) is the prawn veg sweet and sour broth. This will most probably cure any sort of ailment they you may be coming down with due to the chilli and garlic levels. Delicious.The pancake thing looks pretty great (again huge) but I'm yet to try. The viet spring rolls will solve any hangover problem. They do have a card machine (apparently) but it always seems to be down so to be on safe side bring some cash with you.",

I followed the advice of my vietnamese friend and went for the chicken bo bun and i did not regret it. I also took nems as a starter and jasmine tea. Everything was really good ans tasty. The portions were more than decent and i had some difficulties finishing.The place was packed but they managed to find us a table fast and the service was fast and friendly. The noise volume was not too much which i sincerely appreciate as i cannot eat in an extremely noisy environment. Their toilets were clean which i find important. I would definitely go back to try out more dishes.",

A friend and I shared the vegetable spring rolls (which I would highly recommend), \u00a0prawn paste on sugarcane, spicy soft shelled crab and a main of stewed fish in pot with boiled rice, all of which were very tasty (although beware the fish in pot if you don't like spicy food as there was lots of chilli in it). Our group was of 12 people and noone I spoke to had anything bad to say about the food. I would however suggest arriving early if possible as it was very popular - we arrived at noon just as they were opening and by 13.00 it was packed and there was a queue waiting to be seated.",

It's a rather large space with tables right next to each other and a bright green interior. We started out with beers and the appetizer combination. It came with 5 different apps, which was a bit hit or miss (wasn't a fan of the shrimp toast or the ribs). For my entree I had the lemon grass chicken, at the recommendation of my waitress. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. Had a bit of spice to it though, which was welcome. Compared to the Viet food from the States, I thought Song Que was on par, but definitely not better. Perhaps not a fair comparison, but I was told London was known for its Southeast Asian cuisine.",

So when I came here with a friend I was happy to see that it was a restaurant with Asian waiters, and full of customers of different ethnicities. It was super packed for a weekday evening, but we got seated pretty quickly and the food was also fast. I loved how the pho came in a huge bowl (the true way of serving pho) and brimming with soup and spring onions, and my friend who is a vegetarian was really happy with her fried rice and vegetables. Vietnamese anywhere else in the world is known to be inexpensive, so for the price we wish we got more but the food was good enough for us to be happy.",

This is my favourite if the Vietnamese restaurants along the Kingsland Road strip and everyone knows where I mean by 'the big green place on the corner'.Firstly, the starters. The prawn toast is made using slices of baguette, it looks odd because it's something new, but you can tell it's home made and it tastes great! Then there's the cha gio - crispy, lovely, one-of-a-kind spring rolls served with a hoi sin style dip which makes me want to just eat these for my whole meal......So I do! My favourite thing to eat here is the pork vermicelli rice noodles (bun) with extra cha gio on the top! It's fragrant, fresh, good on a summer day when you don't want a steaming bowl of pho in front of you.But then there's always the pho for cooler days! Always excellently, freshly made, always tasty and a huge range of different toppings to try. Add as much or as little of the herbs and chilies which come with it (I say add everything) and they start to infuse the soup as you eat it.An authentic, delicious restaurant. It's great value for money to boot!",

I was also placed at a table with most of the seats already taken rather than an empty.I ordered spring rolls for appetizer, and duck with mushrooms and bamboo stouts for dinner. The spring rolls were crisper than most that I've had. I also think the oil or the batter used was atypical as they had a peculiar flavor that I could not decipher. The duck was perfect. It was in a light colored sauce with scallions which was complemented by the mushrooms and bamboo stouts.No problems with service. The food was prepared extremely quickly. My appetizer came out in about three minutes, and my entree came out three or four minutes after the appetizer.",

P.S. If anyone has found a way to consume this dish gracefully, without dripping things all over your arms and onto the tablecloths, do let me know.Plus, for the decision-challenged yelpers of the world, you're in luck when it comes to the angelhair-esque b\u00fan. You needn't have to choose between spring rolls, grilled pork, or shredded pork with your noodles... you can have all of the above in one bowl! Sheer brilliance (where 'brilliance' is read 'gluttony').And bonus points for staying open late. Though their hours officially close at 2300 on a Monday night, we definitely witnessed a gent walk in and get seated around 2215. -That's- a promising situation, if I've ever seen one in this city.",

It's always busy, and don't be surprised if they seat you right next to another family or better yet, a couple on an awkward first date. This happened to me last night and it was very endearing basically sitting in on their date but also a bit awkward. All part of the experience!I opted for #135 which is the pho with rare beef, tendon and tripe. I most often get the \"special\" which at Song Que, I've determined this pho to be. The portion is generous, and cheaper than the green pho place across the road (can't remember its name!) The spring rolls are consistent and tasty. I haven't tried anything else, simply because these are my go-to Vietnamese items. I did go with a vegetarian once and she was in love with the bun noodles and found no issues with finding tasty things on the menu.If you are confused about which place to pick on Kingsland road for a good pho place, Song Que is a good bet!",

It was tasty but there weren't enough \"bits on the side\" for me as per usual. And our front corner table for two didn't have any sauces on it, though I don't think they would have fit if we had asked for it. We got seated quickly, might have been there before the dinner rush, and we got served within a timely fashion.If it was busy and we had to wait and didn't get the corner seat with more elbow room I probably would have enjoyed it less. It was super packed in there already. Maaaybe go back again. Maybe. On a slow day. With a bag of herbs in my bag. :)",

Some say it is the best one on the street, but yet after another ordinary meal, I find it really hard to understand why it the \"best\" one. We ordered 5 starters and one main.The crown of the meal was the summer roll, full fresh flavour and chilli garlic sauce. The main was the grilled and shredded pork which was delicate, fresh and worked perfectly with all of the complex ingredients.Sadly this is were the good had finished! The chilli squid was chewy and the crab and sweet corn soup wasn't edible.The staff and service was good, and in all I \u00a0do recommend to visit the Song Que cafe, for a nice Vietnamese supper.",

He wanted the fried crispy noodles with chicken and a side of egg fried rice. They served us prawn fried rice by mistake and were ready to change it. But since I wasn't having the rice, he said he'd have the one with prawns.For starters we had the crispy squid and since I didn't want coffee at 11pm, I eschewed my favourite Vietnamese drink and opted for the tender coconut in syrup which was fantastic!Amazing food.

Song Que does not have Bahn cuon, but it has a larger variety of food selection in general and has amazing fresh shrimp rolls and free tap water!The service here is pretty spotty and they did forget about our appetizer, but the food was so good that all is forgiven.The prices are no longer as cheap as they used to be (used to be around 7 quid for a bowl, now the rather large bowl is around 9). A bowl of pho, a bowl of bo bun, a spring roll, iced coffee and coke totalled to about 30 quid. I don't love the price point, but I do love the food.",

    "text": "Ok. I have been here many years ago. I bookmarked it specially to give it another go as a reminder of passing. I was passing. I was craving some type food. I was out voted by friends who voted in favour of Vietnamese rather than Japanese and Fried Chicken as we walked along this stretch. I was hoping for good things. I made sure I looked at reviews online and other sites as I can be OCD like that. I was sadly disappointed.I must say this review is for everything but the Pho. I really should have got the Pho because everyone was having it. The place was packed at 9.30pm but we managed to snare one last table for 3. A table too big for us so we separated out spaced. Service was good. All good English and accommodating without any hassle and helping us with questions. Tiger beer good too of course. Good buzz about place too with being overly mad or too intimate.Onto the meal though. Given that I haven't had much Pho in London. And I mean proper Pho. The best one I've ever had was in Paris. The broth there was so good I tipped it over my face and guzzled it down. You get that right and everything else follows. As I said, I didn't get the Pho. 1- because I didn't want anything too heavy/fatty after drinking most of day and 2- I don't want to stereotype but seeing so many westerners/English around me doesn't make me follow their lead. If they are locals or native tongues (you know when you see authentic Chinese in a Chinese that's a good Sign go sort of thing) then I usually do.The starter of pork summer rolls. The rice paper was much darker and not the usually light colour. Obviously partly due to a darker filling. In hindsight always go for prawn. Summer rolls are better refreshing, a teaser to the meal. These were just gritty and not clean tasting on pallet. I did not enjoy these and was a prelude that set the tone.We each had a main dish... meat (pork) with additional rice; a mango papaya salad and mine being a crispy noodle seafood dish.The pork my friend got only had two pieces. Lots of rice. Meh. Good tasting pork though. Just needed more value for portion I feel.The mango papaya wasn't the best I've ever tried but not bad. Jut needed more freshness and zing. Just more to do it. When you know, you know.My crispy noodle (they asked for soft or crispy). I wanted crispy and liked quite how crispy they made it. Not crunchy tasting more bite to it. It was a huge portion to be fair. That surprised me considering seeing the other two plates I had seen arrive first.The dish overall. Well, I have to admit I wanted, I craved soft shell crab and chicken satay initially. Regardless of the Pho-pas (get it? I'm here all week boom boom!) I wanted something meaty, protein no fattiness or heavy. Somehow I opted for noodle with seafood. So ok I got my seafood craving.It pictures well, plump whole prawns, scallops and squid, maybe octopus too. But the sauce that binded it all together was of best described gloop. Just nothing really. I actually hate stir frys. Although this wasn't as oily as most stir frys you make or order it just did nothing. Very disappointing.I pride myself on never really eating bad meals because I know where to go. I have a long hitlist,I know where I want to hit, but sometimes you do give places a chance. What I do realise is make sure you are at least trying what someone recommended. If esquire or yelpers are saying get the Pho, you damn well get the Pho (even if you don't want it). Of course food is subjective but I doubt I will go back here. If I ever do, and it will be on its last chance it will only be to try the Pho. But don't bother with anything else unless your tastebuds don't work.",

This is a family favourite considering this road has a Vietnamese restaurant at every other shopfront. I love their broth not too salty and the fresh herbs that they give you for the pho is great... I am not a great fan of raw beansprouts but if you dunk it in the soup as soon as it comes out.. Then it gives it a chance to cook in the steaming broth. Also orders the summer roll.. I've had better bit I do love the dip that comes with it.. Lots of others stuff to try.. So will be back for more of the menu..",

First that grilled beef in wild betel leaves, probably the single most tasty starter I've had in a while. Add on top of this the shrimp paste on lemongrass stick..what a treat! My shredded pork + spring rolls on rice noodles was a delish, and my wife's basic beef ph\u00f4 was exactly what she needed.

    "text": "This is the second to last Vietnamese restaurant as you head north along Kingsland road but before you get to the Geffrye Museum. We stopped in randomly late on a Saturday night and the place was buzzing. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, just 5 minutes. Which gave us the chance to chat with the people also waiting. One girl, who could correctly pronouse pho, raved about the pho here, plus the pancake. We weren't starving, so I had the rare steak pho and D had the grilled pork bun. I wished I had ordered the pancake. The pho just didn't do it for me, as the soup wasn't really temperature hot enough. It couldn't par-cook my bean sprouts. The steak wasn't anything special. I would have preferred more broth and the noodles were really stuck together in a lump at the bottom of my bowl (which suggested they'd been sitting in the bowl for a while before the broth was added and they'd probably cooled the soup very quickly too). D devoured his bun, so it was probably quite tasty. Our vietnamese coffees were also good, though I'm not sure the coffee was the true ultra-slow dripped through the wee pot atop your glass variety, as they arrived pre-mixed. It looks like they take reservations and for groups. It was a young crowd of local hipsters on a Saturday evening at 10pm. I just didn't have the pho I was expecting given all the raves I'd heard about the place. But I am really picky about my pho.",

Its layout is simple, nothing special about it, and if it gets packed the tables become communal. We shared a portion of their Vietnamese spring rolls, a plate of fried noodles and a bowl of soup noodles. The beef soup noodles was excellent, and came in a large bowl filled with steaming hot broth and filled with a complimentary melange of spices. Such flavours as ginger, basil, mint are fused together to produce the most salivating flavours. Service is quick, and you don't have to wait long until the food arrives ready to be gobbled up. The complete unpretentiousness of the restaurant allows you to just get on with your food and enjoy it as messily as you want. The prices are extremely reasonable as well.",

    "text": "I couldn't resist kicking off with goi cuon (\u00a33.60), The literal translation is salad rolls but they are also known as summer rolls. On Song Que's bilingual menu, they're called 'fresh roll prawn & herbs wrapped in rice paper'. These were freshly made as evidenced by the crunchy herby salad filling which complemented the rice vermicelli (bun) and the prawns well. To the uninitiated, pho is the famous beef and rice noodle soup of Vietnam served with accompaniments of beansprouts, herbs, chilli and lime. Noodle geeks might be interested to know that the word pho actually refers to the rice noodle but over the years it has become shorthand for the noodle soup itself. I'm pretty sure that Song Que has the largest selection of pho in London. There are no less than 24 choices on the menu with none costing more than \u00a36.80. Most of these are beef based with the more extreme versions including tendon and tripe but there are also chicken, seafood and tofu options. I went for the pho tai nam (\u00a36.30) which is a combo of rare sliced steak and well done beef flank. The beefy broth had hints of star anise and cloves and came further alive when the herbs and a squeeze of lime were added. I only threw in a couple of chopped chillies as I didn't want to overpower the broth. The rare steak slices were actually rare but even better was the well done flank which tasted really beefy (I know this is a crap sentence but I don't know how else to put it). The crunchy beansprouts also contrasted well with the slippery smooth rice noodles.",

    "text": "Song Que Cafe - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I have been coming to Kingsland Road for my fix of Vietnamese food for the last 15 years, and have witnessed a few places coming and then quickly vanishing from sight. S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea Caf\u00e9 is one of the old timers, and I am pleased that it has managed to hang on as one of the most popular restaurants on the Kingsland strip. Time Out has been incredibly complimentary of S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea Caf\u00e9 over the years, and in its most recent Time Out Eating & Drinking Guide 2009, it awarded 5 stars to this Caf\u00e9, its maximum number. Having spent a couple of weeks in Vietnam sampling the most scrumptious food made me realise how good S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea Caf\u00e9 is. A lot of the dishes I tried in Vietnam were not as successful as the ones I had eaten at S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea, while I can still count the few that were actually better. The d\u00e9cor isn't great (the huge plastic lobsters on their walls are actually scary!), and service can be rather grumpy at times. The food, however, more than makes up for these. My latest visit was no exception. As a group of four, we could share a variety of dishes from the menu. I find that their pho (beef soup with rice noodles), starters, salads and buns (vermicelli noodles with meats and salad) are by far their best dishes. We started with Fresh Rice Paper Rolls with Prawns and Herbs, Prawn Paste with Sugar Cane, Grilled Beef Wrapped in Betel Leaf, and Spicy Soft Shell Crab. I love the fresh rolls from S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea, they are fresh and herby with just the right amount of rice vermicelli. This is one of the simplest dishes on any decent Vietnamese menu, and can be prepared well in advance. If prepared too early and not well stored, it can smell and taste of the refridgerator. This is not a problem I have experienced in S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea. Fresh rolls are also great to be made at home and served as canap\u00e9s if you can master the softening and wrapping of rice paper sheets. I would recommend practice well before your guests are due to arrive! I had never ordered the Prawn Paste with Sugar Cane before, but it was highly recommended by the lovely Clare, full time foodie and Senior Dietitian at a prominent London Hospital, who was dining with us that evening. The prawn paste was very flavoursome with hints of garlic and coriander root, a real discovery which I will be ordering again. The Grilled Beef Wrapped in Betel Leaf was also good. The charred and soft betel leaves were beautifully wrapped around the spiced minced beef, the flavours combining well together. S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea's Soft Shell Crab is a real winner. I have tried to recreate this dish numerous times at home with varying degrees of success, but could never get anywhere near S\u00f4ng Qu\u00ea's. Despite being deep fried, it is deliciously light; the batter is always incredibly thin and the chilli and garlic seasoning does not overwhelm the delicate flavour of the crab. However, at nearly \u00a37, I find their Soft Shell Crab portion slightly ungenerous. For mains, we had Traditional Crispy Pancake with Prawn and Chicken served with Salad and Herbs, Green Papaya Salad with Prawn and Pork, Stir Fried Beef with Lemongrass Bun and Spring Roll & Grilled Pork Bun. The pancake was again very good with a coconut flavour to its crispy batter that makes me order it over and over again. This seems to be one of Vietnam's staple street food dishes and I had it many times whilst there. I was slightly disappointed with my Green Papaya Salad this time round. The combination of flavours (sour, sweet, salty) was as good as ever but the thinly sliced pork did not taste as fresh as it could have done. Both buns were very good, but particularly the one with stir fried beef and lemon grass. I normally order the grilled pork & spring roll bun but was pleasantly surprised to taste the wok charred beef in lemongrass. The flavours were excellent and the lemongrass gave a real punch to the dish. Another dish that we did not manage to order this time but that I would highly recommend is the Crispy Sea Bream in Fish Sauce with Mango. As the name suggests, the entire fish is deep fried making it crispy, the shredded green mango is also a great and exotic addition. It is delicious! Verdict \u00a0Authentic and delicious Vietnamese food in the heart of London and as good as some of the best restaurants in Vietnam. Very affordable, our meal cost us \u00a313 per person. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "A unique skill is needed to be a silver service waiter. The finesse comes with the ability to get plates of elegantly presented food to, and finished plates from, a customer in as organised a fashion as possible. The reveal adds to the art, plates delivered and removed with the bare minimum of fuss and if you ever watch an exponent of the art, he or she can clear your table effortlessly, any detritus at the end of the meal less than a hiccup in their perfect plan for your dining. The team at Song Que would, I suspect, laugh at this description of the role of a waiter. Here there really is only one aim, to get you through as quick as possible to make room for the next party already huddled round the entrance. No reservations taken and no quarter given. Get in, order, eat and get out...A large, high ceilinged space, clean, perfunctory and sparsely decorated with the sort of geometric, clashing, faux leather backed chairs you'd find in an Essex boys dining room in the 80's. There's a large painting on one wall, it might be of a village in Vietnam, local to the owner, it might equally be from nearby Broadway market, the design isn't the point here. There are nods to the 'proper' way to do a restaurant, an attempt at an unused back bar for example. A random bottle of Baileys sits on the shelf, disconsolately explaining to a neighbouring dusty Malibu that the vast majority of the punters will be going straight for one of the many different fresh juices, or the imported delights of Hue or Saigon, crisp Vietnamese lagers that cut through the spice to follow.With the service being so speedy, you'll be pleased to know the preparation is very much planned in advance. Of all the dishes Vietnamese cuisine is known for my favourite is the humblest, a bowl of Pho done well has few equals. Light beef stock simmered for hours with a blend of spices including fennel, coriander and star anise before the meats are dumped in at the last minute, bean sprouts and aromatics left to be added tableside. It's the speciality at Song Que, with nearly 30 variants, and after a selection of starters, a keenly priced bowl filled with noodles, that broth, melting thin sliced steak and a scattering of tripe and tendon (worth it, and so soft here) is enough for most people. There's such a depth of flavour in the stock that you're not going to want to season with the obligatory Sriracha hot sauce, but I tend to dip the strips of beef and tripe in to a side pot, but then I'm a chilli hound. Coming back to the starters, a few are worthwhile and interesting, though the Pho really is the thing. (If you want a selection of authentic and delicious Vietnamese starters to build a meal around then nearby Viet Grill is possibly a better option.) We went for their standout grilled beef in betel leaves, the soft and juicy little packages sweetly moreish, fried spring rolls, softshell crab and squid (the latter a little too batter coated for me, though it went swiftly enough). While it's not somewhere for a date, the sight of you licking Pho from your chin is enough to put off all but the most ardent admirers, it's one of the better places for a ribsticking pre or post session bite or a swift lunch along the Kingsland Road.",

The food here really is excellent, and I am hard pressed to decide who wins between Tay Do Cafe and Song Que (both seem equally good in my opinion). One problem with this place being so popular is that it's actually rather hard to just drop in and get a table. They always look at you and say \"reservation??\", and sadly shake their heads when I say \"no\". \u00a0I am then usually put on a probationary table and asked to leave by 8pm or something. So I should learn to plan ahead, but who does that?? The other niggle I have with this place is that while the prices of individual dishes are reasonable, the serving sizes are not, and so you end up compensating by buying more, and thereby ending up still spending a reasonable amount. The overall decor is bright and lively; the waiting staff friendly and attentive. Bottom-line: Arguably the best Vietnamese in town; Book ahead!",

The only warmth you should expect is from the food - service is brisk but brusque. That said, this is one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in London - the dishes are authentic, and they have a comprehensive menu. You can order a different dish each time you visit, altho I usually end up ordering my favourite Beef Pho for mains, but get adventurous with the starters. Try the lotus root salad - it is surprisingly good. The grilled fish/beef starters are excellent too. In fact, there is so much good food to recommend at Song Que, I'll just say go ahead, be inventive. If you're really stumped, look at what your neighbour is ordering, and follow suit! With prices kept between \u00a35-7, you'd be tempted to over order I usually do. But bear in mind, you're not getting French portions here, so you'll end up wasting, if you order more than 1 starter & 1 main course per person. In fact, if you have an average appetite, you'd do better ordering a starter to share, and one main course each. I never spend more than \u00a320 a head at Song Que. In fact, it's more like \u00a312, inclusive of their wonderful Lemonade (homemade Lime Juice). Just don't expect to sit around to chit chat once you've finished your meal - like Wong Kei, they turn out their customers by slapping down your bill, expecting a pay up once you're done. Yes, the turnaround is THAT quick! If you don't want to be hurried off, just take your time with your meal.. but once you're done, they won't want you to tarry.",

    "text": "please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026 I fell in love with Song Que on my first visit over 4 years ago and have been returning frequently ever since. Especially after having been to Vietnam myself I could appreciate the flavour and authenticity of their dishes even more. For me, eating at Song Que is always a treat. It doesn't matter that the atmosphere is canteen-like, the waiters are impolite and too many people are packed into too little space because I am there for the food. And the food is delicious and very cheap. Mind you, not everything is equally nice and the menu is very long and slightly confusing, so it's critical to know what to order to avoid disappointment. Here some of my recommendations: For starters: the fresh spring roles with prawns are an absolute must \u00a0they are full of fresh flavour with buckets of fresh herbs accompanied by a lovely dipping sauce. Heavenly. I absolutely adore their papaya salad \u00a0the green papaya is crunchy and fresh, with a lovely tangy sauce and crushed peanuts complemented with fresh chilli and prawns (although I could do without the pale pieces of pork that come with it, I usually hide them under the prawn crackers). Lovely and fresh is also the lotus shoot salad. The minced beef wrapped in betel leaves is one of the hot starters I truly recommend: the juicy beef is served with fish sauce, rice vermicelli and fresh mint. I am not particularly keen on their B\u00e1nh x\u00e8o (pancakes filled with chicken and beansprouts, served with fresh herbs, salad and dipping sauce) which is not bad as such but too greasy for my taste and it doesn't reach the level of the aforementioned dishes. For mains I personally tend to stick with the noodle dishes which are consistently delightful: I could eat their B\u00fan cha every day. It is basically a very simple dish \u00a0rice vermicelli with lemongrass, fish sauce, fresh Vietnamese mint , prawn or chicken, fresh chilli, bean sprouts and peanuts all mixed together providing a flavour explosion. Also very good is their Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) which comes in different flavours and with different meats. It tastes just like in Saigon and is not much more expensive either. I recommend to avoid their stir frys, they just don't match up to their other dishes.And also.. don't let the service annoy you; just prepare yourself for loads of rude little men, at least they tend to be efficient. I have to mention also that some major improvement has occurred beginning of this year \u00a0they now have a new shiny toilet! (meaning that you don't have to walk through their store room anymore). Song Que is by no means without fault, but in my opinion Song Que consistently offers exceptionally delicious food for incredible value for money.",

    "text": "This place is certainly is not up to standard, i have been to many Vietnamese places and the food is not up to scratch, i dine very frequently and i would not recommend this place to anyone. The place felt very grubby , service was very very poor, we were seated ,not greeted at all, the waiter came over dumped the menus on the table and threw some prawn crackers. When i was ready to order ,i called over to the waiter politely only to be answered with \"what\", disgraceful,. There was at least 8 -10 staff on the floor yet their service showed that they had no clue how to behave and run a business, Although this experience was terrible, i wanted to stay to see if the food was as good as what some reviews had said. To much i was disappointed.... Being of Vietnamese heritage ,the food was chewy, beef was not grilled but seemed fried and old....:( I could not wait to leave, asked for my bill, only to made to wait a further 6-10 minutes, i then took myself to the counter asking for my bill, only to be greeted with a sour face young girl, who simply wrote the bill taking 2 seconds, when i had previously asked for it 10 minutes ago, ... she threw the bill down, Honestly if you are looking for good Vietnamese/ Chinese food i would recommend that you take yourself a little further to West end, where service and food is great!! these areas in Hackney i have learnt that they just dont know how to run a business or treat customers with respect, i often dine at least 2 times a week and i think its important to be fair and honest if places are good or not, so hope this helps!!!",
