A good place to hang-out, and relax, read the paper and enjoy a hot brew. I wasn't as impressed by the coffee as everyone else; I personally thought it was a little burnt/over-roasted, but perhaps that's just me. The vibe and decor are great; though perhaps the seats a little hard for extended sitting. Definitely worth a visit. The best coffee house I know in Soho.",

Scott, maybe the Barista 'ignored' you because he or she was busy extracting a coffee and concentrating on a product for another customer who was there before you? If you want fast service get a 'full bean' coffee at a McDonalds. Ignore that guy Milk Bar kids and keep texturizing and extracting!",

    "text": "I visited this for the first time yesterday and loved it. It was about 10am and I wanted a little bit of piece of quiet and some breakfast. The day was grey and cold outside and 'Milk Bar' had a calm, welcoming vibe that is not often present in sister cafe 'Flat White' (Which is usually busy and a little cramped). Milk Bar is beautifully but subtely styled - like an old Aussie Milk Bar from the 50s complete with little wooden stools outside, multicoloured plastic door ribbons and dark wood flooring. I was recommended the scrambled eggs. Whilst they were being cooked I sat down at the back on one of the leather banquettes and just totally relaxed (rare for me), checked my emails and just felt right at home. My food arrived - perfectly cooked buttery scrambled eggs, grilled toast (lovely bread), some butter and an avocado. Everything was just totally spot on and made me miss Melbourne! Why is it Aussie and Kiwis know how to get food so right whilst we in the UK have no clue!? After my fantastic breakfast I ordered a strong flat white which was great. In general the coffee at both Flat White and Milk Bar is very good but not the best and I'm not sure on Monmouth for an espresso blend as their specialty is really filter coffee. However, it's good and light years ahead of most other cafes in town. Because the coffee didn't blow me away completely that's why Milk Bar only gets 4 stars but I'll go back again - there's more space than Flat White and I found the staff a little less loud!! In summary just the perfect place for a quiet early breakfast and reflection. Brilliant!",

They don't have a huge variety of food with today's offerings limited to a number of sandwiches and stuffed croissants, ranging between \u00a33.5-\u00a35. A toasted vegetarian sandwich with some brie/pumpkin and sweet chilli sauce went down a treat with a creamy flat white coffee. Like their sister restaurant, Milk Bar has a couple of benches outside and with their wide awning makes it easy to sit outside, regardless of the rain beating down (though the wind might get you). Inside they have about ten or twelve tables in a dark, modern and sparse interior only decorated with a handful of small hangings. The attendants were warm and courteous, telling us what they served and patient as we made up our minds. Most importantly, the coffee was extremely well made with the decorative leaf pattern drawn into the top with the rest of the creamy foam. A flat white sitting down costs \u00a32.50 and they have different sizes with difference prices if you decide to have it to go. I wonder how busy this places gets in the morning as I'm not confident they'd be much standing space for ordering and picking up coffees. Highly recommended for a great place and a decent coffee.",

If only it offered free wifi for its customers, this place would be an amazing place to do some revision for uni students. Additionally, the way their food was laid out was not very appetizing. Nothing looked fresh and inviting, and their service was \"meh\" also. I got their iced chocolate (which i assumed was what frozen hot chocolate in serendipity3 in NY is... i still don't know if they're the same thing) in a to-go cup, which was pretty good.

What kind of soy milk are they using? The latte was smooth & silky yet the taste was rather nasty, a little woody & with a bitter aftertaste. I will return after Easter to try one with real milk before I cast my final judgment, but in the meantime, I'm rather disappointed.",

THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. like i was complely miffed as to how it was made. they used some kind of tofu, bannan puree and molasas thing instead of egg and i was totally blown away. the Chef, Tim was really helpful in explaining it all for me. they also have these awesome sweet bar/biscuit things that are yum. music is random but generally great. even on a hot day, the fans really keep it nice and cool.one sad thing: they only stamp their loyalty card if you get coffee, which i dont drink. its a reason to keep going to Flat White, where they accept it for both.",

It was around 10am and I was desperate to escape the hustle of Soho and this place had a lovely welcoming tone.The Milk Bar is set out in a great way and the decor is subtle but effective - it is reminiscent of old \u00a0Milk Bar from the 1950's with wooden stools and dark flooring.I had a coffee and some scrambled eggs on toast which was delicious and I could get on with my work in a calm and pleasant atmosphere. The coffee was actually one of the best I have ever tasted. The staff are friendly but they could see I was working so they weren't too over bearing.The perfect place for a quiet early breakfast.

It's the only place in London that - despite many repeated visits in other locations - have adopted me as one of their regulars and are happy to chat away to me. All thanks to that friendly New Zealand attitude no doubt.Bonus points go for the simple, fresh, veggie-friendly food. The homemade baked beans on toast were delicious, nutritious and light. Finally, they quite literally have water 'on tap' for you to guzzle and offset that caffeine buzz.I love the changing art work that they have on the walls, which always seems selected to suit my taste (bordering on the gothic). The music they play also always chirps me up (as if the smoothly blended caffeine didn't already). Any place that belts out Jimmy Eat World at 8am on a wet Tuesday morning is a winner in my book.",

They don't even sell coke. So I put it on the table and they said I couldn't leave it there. I had to either finish it up (i.e. down the can) or just throw it away. This was quite annoying. It also takes a while before they acknowledge your presence, dropping it a further star down the rankings.I still regularly go there for coffee though, because it's close to Chipotle.",

The flat white was my favorite, and each time I had one I was more and more impressed by how good it was. \u00a0After living in Italy, I'm generally picky about my coffee, but Milkbar was just as good, if not better, than the finest espressos I had in Italy.The food is also delicious. \u00a0The scrambled eggs came out looking much more liquidy than what we see in America, but man were they delicious. \u00a0Creamy and rich. \u00a0And the bread used for toast was superb. \u00a0I also tried the french toast and although this sounds wildly dramatic, I could have died happy after eating it. \u00a0The best part was for sure the caramelized bananas - incredible!Moreover, the general atmosphere of the place was really comfortable. \u00a0They played good music (as a NJ native, I was surprised and excited to hear a Springsteen album one day), had interesting decorations and books, and seemed to attract a very relaxed, calm crowd. \u00a0The baristas were really nice and friendly. \u00a0When I told one girl how good the coffee was - better than anything I'd found in NY - she wrote me a list of coffee shops (several owned/managed by her friends) in New York! \u00a0Thank you Milkbar for being awesome and for turning my chilly London mornings into warm, fond memories. \u00a0:)",

I have to say, it is one of the most well balanced, smooth espresso blends I have had for a while.As well as amazing coffee, there is a food menu of sandwiches, mini pizzas and various other things including breakfast.The interior is quite dark but in a really nice way, and attention is definitely paid to every little detail.

Nothing like a healthy dose of disappointment to make you appreciate amazing coffee served up by the fine folks at Milk Bar.

While not the absolute best Americano I've had here in London, on the yardstick of deliciousness, it's about eleventy billion above bog standard. Certainly a lovely place to meet a friend, a business partner, or simply sit and enjoy the sounds of people who can pull genius of out of a roasted bean.",

The coffee was good haha. and the food was great as well. They have an assortment of sandwiches and bread to choose from. My mother got toast and it came out in a heart shape with several spreads! (Jam, PB) Super cute. Everything was quite affordable and I was impressed by the quality of service.",

If you're into that strong, unburnt long black (yes, they actually know what that is) at right temperature with proper 'crema' (yes, they know how to do that too), or the flat white with properly heated milk (they even do good soy), then this is the joint for you. More room than Flat White up the road. They have a nice range of counter and hot food, pretty good shakes and primo coffee -Antipodean style. Add all that to the efficient and friendly service and you have a winner. I always stop by for a takeaway coffee if I'm in the area.",

The bread in particular is an awesome sourdough. ------DETAILS-----FOOD: Tried the scrambled eggs avocado (comes with toast + lemon slice) + BLAT. The sourdough is amazing - amazing flavor and perfectly crunch but soft texture. The eggs were great though nothing particularly special \u00a0and they have a generous portion of avocado. The BLAT is basically the same but bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato and it was yummy though I would have preferred either more filling or less bread.SERVICE: Neutral: Nothing to write home about bad or good.ATMOSPHERE: Cute little cafe - not a lot of seating, but haven't had trouble finding it on weekends or weekdays. No laptop policy when there are a lot of people though fyi.",

Instagrammed their takeaway cups because the hand-drawn sketches are the best. \u00a0Feeling a little peckish, too? \u00a0Allow me to recommend either their avocado toast or their marmite-n-butter option. \u00a0An acquired taste, sure, but...erm...one I have acquired.What is Milk Bar not as good for?Keep in mind it's small...like, real small. \u00a0It's not the best place to show up and camp out for hours on end, for a variety of reasons (space, wireless, lighting, as other reviews have mentioned). \u00a0Now that I think about it...I'm not sure there is a bathroom? \u00a0So, y'know, another strike against camping out there. \u00a0Yelp note: one of my best spring mornings = grabbing a flat white, sitting on the bench outside, catching a few AM beams of vitamin D. \u00a0Try it!

There are photographs on the walls making it a sort of gallery since they are displaying normal pictures of every day life in a pleasant way to contribute to the atmosphere of this cozy spot. Their bench chairs were a bit on the tall side and made me feel like I was playing at the kids' table at a doctor's office, but other than that the service was friendly and the coffee came quickly.And good coffee it was. True to their sister name, flat whites are the thing to get here. I, however, tried a latte instead since I was too tired to experiment. Thankfully it worked out quite well and soon we were done with our drinks and well on our way to the day. Onwards!",

So, all our milk was in powdered, condensed or evaporated form and we didn't grow up with a culture of drinking fresh milk. In fact, I wonder how Malaysians ever got any teeth!So, when I spied Milk Bar, I wondered if anything here would interest me. Well, this is small but trendy cafe serving hot beverages, snacks and some food.However, my eye was drawn to their milkshakes on the menu board. I adore a proper American malt milkshake and that's one of my treats when I'm on holiday in the States. I asked if this was such a milkshake and was told that it wasn't but that it was made with milk and ice cream. That sounded good enough to me and I ordered myself a chocolate milkshake.It was a lovely milkshake though not to the standard of a top 'made in the USA'. I shall return to try their other flavours",

Stands out for two reasons though: it's a random, nicely decorated cafe on a street with nothing much else on it and secondly because it's so cramped! All of its three (?) tables are good to seat 1 - 2 people and are stationed right up against the front counter.However, to their credit, it is a clean-cut, cutesy type of place reminiscent of a lot of the hipster-type cafes I saw around other European cities. Not quite the same sort of hipster we do in SF but cute nonetheless.I got the iced chocolate. And soon after, I felt like I should've ordered coffee because they seemed good at coffee but it was what's considered a warm day in London so I wanted something cold. The iced chocolate tasted like chocolate milk blended with some ice. Over in the snacks and sweets, I also saw lots of vegan options.If I stayed in London longer, I feel like I might've come back (hoping there were no more than 3 people already in the cafe) and maybe tried a coffee and then found a table to sit down at with some reading or something.",
