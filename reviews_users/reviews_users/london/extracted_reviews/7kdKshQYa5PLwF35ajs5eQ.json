Not like your ordinary Indian place, definitely mixed combination of traditional and urban. Ordered the chicken lollipops they were amazing, not too spicy which meant you could taste the aromas and spices used. The sweetness of the tamarind is amazing. The Bhel Puri was my favourite, fresh, subtle flavours and the pomegranate helps break up the chilli. The calamari was a bit weird, not something I'd recommend, was chewy, too sweet and just not my cuppa tea. To drink I got the Punjabi masala Chai, quite a kick of cinnamon, pleasant to drink, doesn't need any added sugar. Would definitely go back to try more dishes. Even though they were busy, service was on point and they were also great at suggesting dishes to try out.",

    "text": "I was skeptical about the food but after eating here, I think it's only fair for me to say that I'm wrong. The curry chicken was amazing so was the paratha. I guess the type of curry they serve err on the side of South Indian curry, but don't be put off by it, give it a go and I think you might like having coconut cream in your curry now. It wasn't the cheapest place for the portion of food that it was serving, so I would say this is a slightly more expensive place to eat at. The atmosphere was just right, busy but quiet enough to still have a chat (I was in at lunch time peak hour!). If you're going at lunch time, it's likely that you'll be sitting on a bar stool with canteen style table, it's good but I suppose if you really wanted the standard sitting style they wouldn't mind setting up something for you. I hope when you try out Chai Ki, you'll be like me; murmuring in my heart \"chai ki, you're amazing!\" :)",

    "text": "Ventured down to beautiful Canary Wharf on Friday to have lunch at Chai Ki. Unfortunately this restaurant was a bit of a letdown.Ambiance is great, beautiful clean lines and everything is new. Unfortunately the acoustics are terrible and seating is close together, so be prepared to yell across the table in order to be heard.Service is not good at all. It took forever for someone to take our drinks order, then we had to flag another person down to order food. Servers aren't very friendly, which may be because they seemed to be very spread thin.Food is mixed:-- Bun Tikki is a great concept but huge chunks of the sweet potato were undercooked. Also, it comes with cheese, which I don't eat as I'm lactose intolerant. Not sure why the menu doesn't mention this important ingredient but lists mayo as an ingredient. I had to eat around the melted cheese.-- Shakarkandi Chaat is excellent but very spicy. Be prepared to eat this with your mouth on fire. I wish they could tone down the spice level because this was fantastic.-- Chicken Tikka Naan was just okay per my husband. I don't eat chicken so I can't comment. He didn't finish this if that says anything.-- Burnt Ginger Rice was delicious but came with sesame seeds on top. Again, no mention of this on the menu and since I can't eat seeds / nuts (I know, I am high-maintenance), I had to request it to be made again. The manager(?) seemed irritated with me but I pointed out the menu should mention this ingredient, which it doesn't. She grudgingly replaced the dish but it took a while.-- Green Chutney Slaw wasn't very good AND it came with sesame seeds. Sigh.Overall: Maybe Chai Ki is so new it's working out service and food kinks? I have no idea but I prefer Masala Zone or even Roti Chai. I doubt we'll return.",

I have had loads of puri and chaat (see my pictures if you don't know this) when in South India and this was the (first and) best puri and chaat since then. We then had a very spicy (very nice) chicken dish with a lot of vegetables and chicken tikka naan. Washing it away with a Bethnal Pale Ale was great. Although just open and not too busy on a Monday evening there was a good atmosphere, kind staff, a bit loud but good music (even some Goa trance I guess) and a great interior. When really open they should have three separate concepts and parts of the restaurant: a fastbar (for breakfast takeway), a toddy shop (kind of chaat place, more snacks and starters) and the dining room (for lunch and dinner, bit more quiet dining probably).The bill was very acceptable (actually lower than expected).Definitely want to return here!",

    "text": "We went out looking for a Sunday breakfast in the Canary Wharf area which is close to home. The obvious choice is to try the Breakfast Club. We thought we'd chance the queues and give it a go considering we were fairly early - 1030-ish. But we were out of luck and the place was packed (as always) and we would have to wait for 20-30 mins for food. We were famished so we decided to roam. Just next door we found 'Chai Ki' and the menu sounded really interesting at first glance. It is an Indian take on Classic British dishes. The best of course being the Full Nashta which is, of course, the Full English Breakfast. The bacon stays as it is - but thats all that remains the same. There is bun instead of toast, egg burji instead of scrambled, masala beans instead of beans and a spicy sausage instead of the regular one. Of all the stuff, its the bun that wins as its toasted to perfection. Reminded me of the paos back in India. For 11 quid thats the equivalent of a proper Hinglish Breakfast ;) The masala tea was a bit too masala-ed. The ambience was good though I didn't take a long look around. They do drinks as well with a 'Kallu Shap' sing behind the bar. Will definitely be back again.",

Came here on a Saturday night for dinner and decided to go in the back restaurant bit for a more formal feel. Though we loved the food on the bar menu you can't order from both menus, which was a disappointment. For starter we got GOAN PRAWNS, and they were absolutely delicious. I wish there were more than 5 pieces because it really kept me wanting more. I got butter chicken and my boyfriend got the gohst. Butter chicken unfortunately only comes with 5 pieces but nonetheless it was great butter chicken. My boyfriend got the lamb dish and it was a huge portion side which was perfect. As for drinks they are all delicious and I would definitely recommend the Mango Caipirinha!!! Chai Ki is a great restaurant, which I definitely would recommend though next time I will definitely want to check out the bar menu",

But what struck me was the fact that there was a sign in the bar written Toddy in English and \"Kall-eh\" in Malayalam. After reading the owner Rohit Chugh's interview about the opening of this restaurant, I understood that his inspiration for the dishes in this one was Malabar toddy shops and the food served around there. I must admit the ambiance is really good. Great place to dine with a special person. Great staff too. About the food, the dishes I tried were:Dahi puri - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da\u2026Dal fry - this one is made of dark dal (lentil)Malabar Chicken Curry - coconut milk in the gravy, creamy, yet spicy, thanks to the wonderful chillies.Malabar Porotta - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa\u2026 this is what I expected, but what I got was Paratha - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa\u2026. The latter has nothing to do with Malabar. Also had Garlic naan - very thin crested naan, crisp and delicious The chilly fries - fries with some chilli powder sprinkled all over was served with a tasty dip, which I guess was a mix of mayo and some other sauce. Its texture reminded me of Southwest Sauce from Subway.We also had the masala chai, which was made with just the right amount of sugar. Overall it was a lovely meal. And I'll definitely go there again. But some dishes like the Porotta, really needs a proper Malabari chef to make it. Else it'll never be porotta. But that is for those who know real Malabar dishes. For Londoners who have barely travelled outside London, this will be amazing.",

Unlike most other Indian restaurants in London, Chai Ki has a massive collection of craft beer, an extensive wine list and some very interesting and creative cocktails that are inspired by South Asian flavours such as the chai & orange martini which the gin has, blended with spices.The menu comes in sharing plates and mains, so diners have the choice to mix and match, ordering 1 sharing plate as a starter followed by a main or simply go for a number of sharing dishes like you would in a tapas bar. The instant winner on the night was the dahi puri, the crunchy semolina shells were so light and crispy with a cool and refreshing yoghurt resting with nutty tamarind, my kind of summer dish. The mild spicy pulled pork paratha was also excellent, tender meat with the freshness of the coconut mixed wonderfully with the chilli and curry leaf. And just as good was the calamari, again lightly spiced, smooth with a peppery sweetness from the cane sugar and cumin.Main dish of coconut prawns was a real full flavour dish, it had a wonderful mild spicy aroma with rich and creamy textures, it was not overpowering with the coconut milk, finely blended in with the turmeric and the sweet prawns. The weak link on the night was the duck porridge, while I did not hve a problem with the flavour, the texture was far too thick and heavy which was hard for me to consume. We were so full toward the end so ended up going for a light dessert, the mango kulfi ice cream lollipop was very creamy and buttery with the sourness of the exotic fruit adding a great balance.To sum it up, Chai Ki is indeed an excellent Indian restaurant, it is hard to find a decent restaurant in Canary Wharf, mostly chains in both standard and premium territory so Chai Ki really offered something different, it is very good value, with small plates ranging from \u00a37 - \u00a38 and all mains under \u00a315. The street food element of its cooking also made it very approachable and easy to understand of what the restaurant is offering, so if you are a fan of modern Indian cuisine at an affordable price in Canary Wharf, look no further than Chai Ki.",

We had butter chicken, the aubergine, paneer and kulfi ice cream. Everything was solid, plated beautifully and came very very quickly which was nice and maybe a bit concerning. The only thing that distracted me abt the food was this green/black herb that was in all the food but gave it a bitter taste which was not my fave. The garlic naan was also a bit overdone but overall good food option in CW",

An Indian (even fusion) should offer vegetarians a balanced meal, which potatoes surrounded by bread is definitely NOT. Charging extra for pickles and chutneys is not pukka. And salad dressed with mayonnaise?! Would not recommend this place to anyone. 2 stars is for the chai and crushed potatoes accompanying the salmon.",

Being Indian myself I'm always on the lookout for good Indian eats in London (especially when those home food cravings set in!).Chai Ki is a modern, spacious restaurant with great service. I had their butter chicken and rice which was flavourful, but I do think the portion was small given the price of \u00a315.50 (I'd gone with a good appetite and hadn't ordered any starters). Their ice masala chai was divine! I would definitely recommend this. Would I go again: Probably not (a little pricey for the portion sizes for me)",

When I was seated waiting for my friend it took several minutes and me flagging someone to get water and a drink. Same thing when they cleared our plates we had to ask for the bill minutes later. Also would it kill anyone to smile and greet us friendly?Otherwise the meal was superb. Full of flavour and colour. I highly recommend the pear chicken tandoori salad to start. Bright and beautiful! The Malai paneer was creamy and delightful. The spicy coconut prawns was in a dazzling curry that did not disappoint. Ginger fried rice and garlic naan were the perfect accompaniment.I enjoyed the pomegranate martini while my friend had a sweet fruit mocktail she liked. All in all a really delicious meal in a trendy setting. Well worth the trip to Canary Wharf for me!",

    "text": "I love and hate this restaurant at the same time. I come here on average once a week so clearly they are doing something right. The food is really good. Flavours are balanced, innovative, and just great overall. Winners that never disappoint include burnt chilli chicken, calamari (not ur usually Italian style squid I promise!), and chicken tikka nann. Chai Ki pilsner is great as well.Now, it's the service and management that really let this place down. For starters, you are only allowed to order from one of two menus depending on which area you sit in (bar vs restaurant). You are 'not allowed' to order from the two menus at the same time even though it's the same kitchen that cooks food for both menus. One really helpful waiter once tried to go out of his way to 'allow me' to order one item from the bar menu when I was sitting in the restaurant area and got in trouble. Yes. I saw him actually being told off. I hosted a birthday party here once and had to get pre approval to order two dishes from the 'other menu'. This was accomplished only after escalating the matter to a restaurant manager and negotiating for a few days. Yes. A few days. If you come here when it's slightly busier than usual, be ready to either order immediately, or risk waiting about 10 minutes before being served tap water. Waiters and waitresses are not trained adequately here. Pleasant people but clearly no clue what needs to be done. Overall, it's a place I love and a place I love to hate. If they get the software right and start thinking more customer orientated, they can easily be one of the best restaurants in the area.",

Dishes are a bit sweet but not overly such. The portions are perfect for two people and not too heavy on the meat or veggie side.One more word... cheesecake. Just do it. You'll thank me later.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside, the staff very friendly and attentive. The food was visually beautiful and colorful.

A creamy vegetarian curry, consisting of sweet potato, red and green peppers, courgette (although the menu said aubergine), mange tout, baby corn and crispy kale. All the different textures and flavours of the vegetables worked really well with the curry. The fragrance of the coconut together with the mild spices were really nice.The rest of food was good, but not quite enough to blow us away. It was also a little pricey for the food we had.",

    "text": "Recently there has been an uprise of more fancy Indian restaurants, breaking away from the association of it being a cheap date option and therefore introducing modern and beautiful venues. Chai Ki is one of them. It's a nice looking restaurant with its high ceiling and spacious dining area although very generic looking with nothing associating with the cuisine. If you were to blindly walk in you would have never guessed what cuisine they were serving. It is still very quiet being in the new Crossrail Place that is not really in use yet so not many people have a reason to just venture in. But what differs Chai Ki from the other Indian restaurant is that they serve more exotic and unusual dishes that you might not find at your local curry house. But with all these added luxuries there is always a price to pay. So was it worth it?Bhel Puri. A fantastic colourful dish with a lovely mix of texture. It had bursting juicy pomegranates, crispy rice and softer textures of potato and onions all coated in lovely mild spices. Quite moreish if you're one to enjoy a bite.Shakarkandi Chaat It looked amazing but sadly they was very disappointing. The sweet potatoes were undercooked meaning the sweetness was very much masked. Of course this affected its texture, missing out on the soft melting sweet consistency that I love. \u00a0It was bland and under seasoned too and the yogurt did not do it any justice. Dahi Puri This was like a piece of creative art in my mouth. I very much enjoyed the delicate semolina shells slowly collapsing into my mouth releasing a lovely creamy sensation of sweet yogurt with a slight citrusy zing from the tamarind. Delicious!Haggis keema naanImpressive creativity to celebrate burns night. Naan stuffed with lovely spiced lamb keema, beef and lamb haggis. The bread was doughy and fragrant with many complex flavours packed in there. The raita helped add some creaminess and cool down the heat. The turnip pickle didn't pair well with the naan but was lovely on its own to snack on.Duck porridge This duck dish isn't for everyone due to its thick gloopy rough texture resembling just like it says, porridge but more grainy and savoury, a bit like houmous. It was very filling being quite dense but being a person who loves houmous, I very much enjoyed it, scooping it up with the brioche or even to eat it on its own with a spoon. The ingredients and flavours were very interesting, although the flavours weren't strong, you do get the taste of the unusual mix of rose water, cracked wheat cardamom and spices.Konkan chicken This was a very mild and creamy dish. Probably a dish for those who can't handle their spice as it's quite a sweet curry. It lacked depth and spices. The flavour was just too simple and a dish I could find nearly in any local curry house. It was a nice dish to have overall, but not outstanding or memorable. Burnt ginger rice On the side of all the mains we ordered the burnt ginger rice. Now this was lovely. The rice was moist and al dente. \u00a0It was almost like I could taste the spices wrapped round each grain. The spices were light but just enough to give that extra kick of flavour when you enjoyed it with your curries and other mains.Dhal fry This came generously and thick in texture. Lovely notes of mild spices and the lentils cooked till soft and almost creamy. I could have eaten this alone with rice.Masala friesThe most addictive fries you're ever going to find. The fries were so crisp and light they were almost hollow. The seasoning was light but flavourful allowing you to keep picking on them until they're all gone. They were not greasy or sickly. We even spotted a couple with a bowl each. We did very much enjoyed our experience at Chai Ki. Service was a hit and miss depending on who is serving you. We had one waiter who kept rushing us and taking the menu off us before we had even finishing ordering. The other waiter was more patient and friendly, assisting us with a smile. But there's something important missing at Chai Ki, a lack of charm and character. It's like they half heartedly open this restaurant, serving some authentic and creative dishes but catering for the Western tastebuds with sweeter and milder flavours and not allowing us to enjoy the full experience of Indian cuisine. With more successful branches doing the similar thing but better, like Dishroom that is also more wallet friendly, I rather go there.",
