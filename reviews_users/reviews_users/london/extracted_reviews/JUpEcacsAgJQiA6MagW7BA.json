You might not notice Gastro from the outside ('cept for the neon sign) but it's a small French place which is very expensive for it's location and unassumingness! However the food we had was nice. After some comp french bread, we (2) shared a huge bowl of mussels to start. They were nice, but perhaps a little bland. Then we both went for the steak which was huge and offered with a choice of either peppercorn or Bearnaise sauce & some very tasty fries. With just fruit juice to drink the bill came in at about \u00a360. I can imagine it would be a great place to go with a large group of friends, because there is a massive table at the back of the room. It's also the type of place you'd like to eat french bread & jams for breakfast, and at the other end of the day has handy opening hours, open till midnight!",

    "text": "Clapham High street on a November Saturday night throws up our nations finest, or is that our nations finest throwing up? Magaluf springs to mind. Its not clear if they are showing off tricks learnt last summer in San Antonio or practising for next summer. Either way the Easyjet detritus are here hunting for snog riots while being all over excited on the alcopop sugar content. So looking for a nice restaurant on the hoof was optimistic in the extreme. We spotted a neon 'restaurant here' sign down a side street opposite the cinema but passed it off as a bit of wayward costa del graffiti. I put in an SOS call to Lizzie (a walking Qype) and she directed us back down said side street and into the neon. Gastro is an oasis of French joy marooned in the madness of Clapham. It is so authentic that the waiter will engage you in rapid fire French. If you cant respond he will practice his pigeon English on you, but best to play the game. We were parked in a booth in a corner but that didn't stop them anticipating our needs . And the place was heaving. The whole crab starter came intact with the requisite dentist type tools, and the rare calves liver was melt in the mouth gorgeous with great dollops of creamy mash potato. The wine list was at the spenny end of my budget but that didn't seem to stem the flow. The French banter continued through out the meal, aided by the late arrival of the aforementioned Lizzie. By the time we had paid the bill and decided to leave we had made good friends and said fond au'revoirs before heading fortified into the frenzy.",

And yes the food can be occasionally inconsistent, but for the most part it's excellent, and to this day it has provided me with my finest ever steak frites. And over-priced? Not really, considering the area and the quality of food. Let's stop French bashing, shall we, and just enjoy an eaterie which isn't owned by pizza express plc.",

Gastro servers delicious, authentic French food in a bubbly yet cosy atmosphere. It's a great place to go for a candle-lit dinner but the bigger banqueting style tables also suit larger groups. The service is friendly and attentive and generally speaking the staff will go out of their way to accommodate your needs. However, on a couple of visits I have found the service to be somewhat slow due to a lack of staff and a heaving restaurant. All the meat and fish served here is organic-farmed or free-range. They have a tank full of their own lobsters in the middle of the restaurant. The mussels and oysters are a must to start and the bouillabaisse is divine! Tour waiter or waitress will also bring you a basket of fresh bread as soon as you are seated, which is a nice ouch without having to ask. The drinks in here are as good as the food, with a fantastic wine list too. This place is a good place to start a night as it's really easy to get to right by Clapham Common tube station, which also means you have the choice of bars down the high street for post-dinner drinks!",

The communal table at the back is a great place too. Wine was great although rather pricey for what it was (15quid for a split). Starters were huge and lovely: the goats cheese salad was excellent. Then what was supposed to be the main event arrived: the beef for two was right in every way except for the beef. Something was strange about the cut of meat not to mention the way it had been cooked. 3 bites in and I pushed my plate back. My partner and I began an argument about au point (what we'd ordered) vs bleu. This was neither. I know, I should have sent it back esp at 44 pounds a shot. But panic set in. Were they taking the piss? I have sent meat back before and I probably should have done so this time, I was just too shocked to do it. In between waves of panic before the check came, I looked around at the other plates on the communal table: they looked fine, better than fine. I also looked at the other diners-- all happy. But it was too late for me. We paid and got out of there tout suite. 88 pounds poorer in 45 minutes. A new record. Moral to the story: don't get the beef for two.",

The service is as you would expect in any French brasserie - imperfect and non-ingratiating - but somehow just right. The wine is rustic and pleasingly served in a down to earth tumbler, accompanied by a bowl of proper French bread. Gastro is always packed, but if you can't get a table it's more fun to sit at the bar and practice GCSE French with the waiters.",

But in the evening this place becomes a crowded, sloppy, arrogant restaurant that thinks it is a lot better than it actually is.On our last visit, last month, the service was painfully slow - more than 45 minutes for the starters; nearly an hour between starters and mains. Items were delivered late (side dishes arriving well after the mains) or missed off the order altogether. On a previous visit we tried to order a bottle of wine, which was priced at \u00a320. We were told it wasn't available but a new wine, not on the list, would make the ideal replacement, so we took the waiter's advice. There was no mention of price, and we assumed it would be roughly the same as the out-of-stock bottle. We enjoyed the wine (and ordered a second) but were rather taken aback when the bill arrived at the end of the night: the replacement wine was nearly \u00a345 a bottle - more than twice what we had intended to pay. The food is average to good (hardly exceptional), but be aware that you will get poor service, plenty of attitude and a bill that is higher than it deserves to be (and that's without taking the waiter's wine recommendation!)",

We both had gambas for main - tasteless wet rice and no discernible flavour to the prawns. The saving grace was the Tarte Tatin - unfortunately my partner was so hungry he hoovered it up so I didn't get much. Even the friends who took us there kept adding salt and pepper to their ravioli and chicken in a desparate attempt to add some flavour to their bland overcooked dishes. All in all we left hungry and \u00a3110 lighter. I do disagree with comments about the staff - they were perfectly nice to us.

We have been visiting regularly the Gastro for a long time now and I can always recommend the chateaubriand steak for dinner and a full bodied wine (the manager can always recommend a good bottle of wine without letting you down) and for breakfast I always have the the eggs atlantique with Benedict sauce. However the last time the sauce was quite funny and didn't meet my expectations, I hope that was just a coincidence! Last time we ordered oysters for our starter, six to share between two. The size of the oysters was really small ! Never ask for ketch up or they will get offended and for lactose intolerant people there is no such thing is soya milk! They don't charge for extra bread which is always good. Their espresso is fine but next time I'll probably go for the chocolate! The service is in general good, taking into account they all french and therefore not very popular for that reason. However most of them are very accommodating and polite. Once you become a regular costumer and they recognize you the service becomes better and they will definitely look after you well!",

The rustic authentic feel to Gastro is definitely a huge selling point; however the prices were unexpectedly high! I ordered the Monkfish wrapped in bacon with Spinach which was \u00a318 and was shocked when it came with no sides, I was tempted to order some mash potato, but didn't want to miss the first half of the film. The staff were very attentive and my meal was very filling so I can't really complain, I will try it once more as the mussels on the menu were calling me But If I am planning to do a Starter main and dessert I better make sure I'm armed with the cash to do so haha!",

It's a great place to bring a few friends (if you book ahead), and the atmosphere is perfect to escape a wintry downpour or just to escape, really. I've reduced the number of stars because the grubbiness quotient has increased in recent months. A regular commitment to disinfect the surfaces, and do some dusting would increase my rating.",

While madness reigned in every decent place on the High Street, Gastro was remarkably quiet and relaxed, and no one tried to fight us for one of the nice tables outside. Very odd, considering the quality of the food, the loveliness of the place itself, and the charming French waiters - well, all the better for us! The menu consists mainly in various French food, but in case you were worried they also serve the English breakfast. I didn't try it, but it looked very good. Really superb coffee, if you're into that kind of thing.",

    "text": "Food around the world that smells bad, usually tastes good...* Stinking Bishop may smell of old socks but it's melt-in-the-mouth gorgeous.* Durian is perfectly nice as long as it's fresh and you have mango straight after.* Stinky Tofu is actually delicious as long as you get it fried fresh at the right place....but the French and their \"Andouillette\".... erm, no thanks. It's smells of shit and it tastes of shit. Thanks a lot Gastro for serving such a pleasant item to me.To be fair, I was warned. Le Garcon told me 'Sir, are you sure you want to have this, it's a tripe sausage?' and yes... I said yes. Part curiosity, part gastro one-up-man-ship over my 3 fellow diners. Tripe can be good, right?Not in Andouillette form, it seems.The rest of our meal did go well - good soup and seafood, plenty of the French classics on the menu, atmospheric, rustic and slightly cramped French surroundings and a decent punch at wine. Plus the helpful and informative Garcon with his warning.But Anduoillette is not recommended for your main course. You'll smell your big smoking brown sausage before it gets to you - like a warm turd on a plate with fries. It only smells of one thing... POO. And apparently this is unavoidable as the type of tripe you are eating is colon, and no matter how much it's washed, it never loses that base fecal whiff. Without a sense of smell it could actually taste quite nice with it's texture of folds and earthy, meaty flavours, but when are you ever going to eat with no sense of smell?Put it this way... we all quite like our night at Gastro but when my Anduoillette arrived, no-one on our table could eat their food anymore. It's the ultimate anti-social meal.",

    "text": "Ah missing La Belle France? Me too. Take a trip to Gastro, a wonderful, rustic style French restaurant tucked away in Clapham. Having been on many French trips during my childhood, I have happy memories of steaming piles of moules mariniere and heaps of frites. Gastro is oh so French from the charming host to the waiter who bowed to me on the way out the door. The menu is traditional French(moules and all), they drop off a gorgeous bread and butter basket on every table and the mayo comes in tiny jam jars. Knowing that this little gem would definitely not have gone un-Yelped, I did a quick looky up on my mob and ordered the Soupe de Poissons, on the recommendation of Derry.N. It was hearty and delicious and so I'm told was the steak. I wish we had been there for longer, but since we were in a hurry, we didn't get to try the scallops or the risotto. However, the word is out on Gastro and we were charmingly recommended that the next time we should book ahead as it is very busy. Still though we were only waiting ten minutes.",

When I came in on Christmas eve, I told them I only had 20 minutes, and my breakfast and tea duly arrived in only 10, and I was out of the door on time and caught my train. The only small downside is the lack of beans! But the sausages were delicious.",

    "text": "I have frequented this murkily authentic little French bistro for lunch many times yet I still don't feel quite qualified to write a review. The reason is I have, without fail, always ordered the same food. When I peruse the menu, if I even bother, memories of the last time I enjoyed soupe de poisson here come floating back and I quickly order it again.Its a rich, ruddy, full-flavoured soup which is served with little pieces of \u00a0toasted French bread on the side. There is also a heap of grated cheese and a buttery sauce I have yet to identify. You can dip and dunk to your heart's content - very filling and satisfying!As I mentioned, I order the same stuff. So the only other things I can recommend from the bistro apart from the soup are the Breton cider, and the hot chocolate & croque monsieur, which my girlfriend always gets, and loves. How boring... and delicious!A word on the waitresses - the service can be pretty erratic. I recently had to insist we pay only for our drinks after being kept waiting for over 40 minutes to eat. Having said that, the cheery 'bonjours' and 'au revoirs' quickly erase any such bad feelings, and it wasn't enough to stop us dropping by.",
