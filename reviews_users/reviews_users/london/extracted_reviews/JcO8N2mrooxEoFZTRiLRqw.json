(not just for drinking at night, but for tea and lunch during the day as well) The staff, owners, and patrons were a fantastic group of people. I loved the menu - the roasted Camembert \u00a0with herbs was particularly amazing, and the puddings were heavenly. I wasn't a huge beer drinker, but I was really pleased with the cider and wine selection. The hot spiced wine at Christmas was a treat for us Americans who hadn't had it before. When the weather was nice, socializing and drinking out on the street was a must. \u00a0I hear the owners and most of the staff have moved on, and I really hope it hasn't lost its charm. Either way, when I go back to London one of these days the Queen's Arms is #1 on my list of places to visit!",

This was my work's local, as I used to work at Imperial College which is but a very swift half's distance away!Good selection of drink, and good choice for lunch as far as \"pub grub\" standard food is concerned. It's usually populated by students and staff from Imperial & RCA around lunchtime, but gets much busier in the evenings (particularly during Prom season) with attendees going on to the Royal Albert Hall. Service can be a struggle on busy evenings however -- the bar area is not huge, and 20 minute waits to be served are not unheard of. However, if you get there when it isn't packed to the gunnels, it's a highly serviceable and pleasant pub -- better than quite a few others in the local area.PS: Unfortunately, the antique and luxury car showroom which used to be opposite has closed...",

Hidden until the last minute down a obscure side street, the location makes it the ideal spot for standing outside enjoying a few pints of their great selection of ales on tap (Sierra Nevada, Meantime Pale Ale, Discover, Adnams to name a few) The interior is decent, quite spacious filled with a bit of a funny mish-mash of old wooden tables, on which I fully recommend you situate a couple of bowls of their hearty home-made chips.

The food is average, but edible and reasonably priced too with all sandwiches under \u00a35 and more substantial dishes under \u00a310. It's always nicely busy, but not overcrowded and there's usually a comfortable spot to prop yourself up against even if all the seats are taken. The low lighting from the candles in wine bottles and the chandelier is an inviting touch. When I've been the drinkers have been predominately male and last time I went a fight nearly broke out. This was rather exciting as I didn't know people in South Ken ever resorted to fisticuffs, perhaps just choosing to settle their differences with a severe game of poker instead, so we all found this made the place even more likable. Students hey. Of course it all ended with a laugh and a few pats on the back, the whole curfuffle was probably just down to the excess of testosterone in here.",

Never a good sign when it comes out the kitchen 3 minutes after you order. The beef was clearly not just carved and both meals were luke warm. This pub would be fine for an outdoor after work drink in the summer, but in the winter it is cold and pretty unwelcoming. There are much nicer and cosier pubs in this part of the world.",

It can be a bit difficult to find, but if you prepare yourself with a map or an iphone (with the yelp app installed - obviously) then you should be alright. The place was filled with the likes of me, also on the way to Royal Albert Hall, dressed up and having a nice meal. But there were also a large number of students. The atmosphere was nice, friendly and it felt really good to step into this pub with friendly staff. Just a note, I noticed they had one of those annoying cash machines that charge you \u00a31.75 so I suspect there is a minimum on using cards in the bar. My order was more than 10 quid (the usual limit I think) so my card wasn't rejected but if you only go here for a pint or so then perhaps ensure you got some on you before you arrive (I think the nearest free ATMs are probably on kensingon high street) to avoid the annoying and additional cost of just getting hold of some bills. Ordered a chicken and bacon sandwich with brie cheese (melted) and it was absolutely divine! Love to come back for more items they dish out from this kitchen! So, if you are in the area, this is a safe bet rather than risking going to those tourist-pubs that would only disappoint you...",

If the UK every bans drinking in public then pubs like these will die a death.The Queens Arms is pretty, homely and spoils the cider drinker for choice. I'm more of an ale guy, but if sweet, dry or just potent cider is your thing then The Queens Arms will be heaven for you. How do you like those apples!Just one more thing... timing is everything here. Turn up ten minutes too late and the place is full to the brim with Imperial staff and students. But get it just right, and it's a great drinking hole. I've not worked out the timing just yet.",

The owners are lovely, barmen and ladies great and the food is fantastic and very well priced for the quality. This place does occasionally get busy as it is becoming more well known thanks to its popularity with locals and students, and they serve a good variety of drinks and ales in particular. A bit pricey for me, but probably average for the neighbourhood it's in. Very quirky interior with lots of wood to lean against and the tables inside are wooden as well, creating a lovely old fashioned atmosphere, balanced against good hearty British pub grub. A great place to visit. I went here again for dinner the other day and was delighted to see on tap Aspall's Peronelle's Blush, which I had never seen nor had before. A great combination of apple and blackberry, though not the most manly drink I've ever held onto. My burger was lovely as well, and the Bloody Mary sauce that goes with it is great!",

The pub offers a good range of cask ales including the excellent Fullers London Pride. We ordered a pint of prawns to share, followed by lentil & spinach burger which comes with chips. The food was excellent apart from the burger bun, which was one of those dense and tasteless American style white bread burger buns - a choice of wholemeal bun would have been good.

Situated in a quaint cobbled cul-de-sac, I used to stop off here on the way home, (there is a vintage car showroom opposite with some wonderful old cars) and it is place to go to let the traffic die down before the journey back to Chiswick. \u00a0You can waste an hour or so and stand outside in the quiet street and enjoy a nice beer. Very small and it attracts people that are going to the Royal Albert Hall, so it can get amazingly busy and it can difficult to even get in the pub. Food is cheap and cheerful but I would imagine good enough to line your stomach before heading off for some culture. Not a great night time place in my opinion but it does a job as a refuge if you need one as per the traffic home etc.",

So glad this place popped up in our Yelp search as most nice sit-down restaurants were crazy busy and most pubs stopped serving food at that time.We ordered a couple rounds of ales on draft that we hadn't tried yet after our travels in Cambridge, plus the following for dinner:There was an awesome bar food special of 13 pounds for any three out of around five options ( a few were out). We got thick-cut sweet potato wedges, \"baked brie\" (actually just warm with caramelized onions on top and bread on side), and whitebait (amazingly my new fav complement to beers, as they're little, crispy and surprisingly meaty fishes).We split an entr\u00e9e of oxcheek and kidney \"pie\" - it was actually mostly meat with a puff pastry on top, which I prefer, that came with side of mashed potatoes (for some reason, a bit cold), and a side of roasted veggies. Very filling!Lastly, we split a dessert - a large order of profiteroles covered in chocolate and caramel sauce with salted caramel ice cream ice cream - loved sweet /salty combo but this was completely too much food. The bartender/server immediately suggested it first-off so we just had to follow up at the end of the night.Service overall was very friendly and bartenders know the food and beer, even with one of them having just started about a month ago. Vibe is a definite hangout for locals. Would return if we could!",

With a late open kitchen and on top of that some really great bar food it was a great ending to a day in London.I can't say what it's like when full of people, but late in the evening it was calm, the service was nice and the food was delicious. Try out the sweet potatoes wedges and the goat cheese something-something with bread.And being a cider fan, there was some really nice dry and half dry ciders.In a part of London I assume only inhibited by folks who can afford some expensive housing it was not to fancy of a pub - just folksy and nice.

    "text": "What better way to find a pub than to turn a corner and be greeted with a charming little robin's egg blue spot tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. From the beautiful exterior to the lively interior, we were charmed by The Queen's Arms immediately. We stopped here for drinks and chips in the middle of a weekday and were surprised how full it was. Our service was prompt and polite, and the drinks were delicious and well-priced considering the area. The chips were crisp and hot, just as they should be. I wouldn't consider this pub to be the best we visited in London, but the warm and cozy vibes we got while here, coupled with good drinks, certainly made us glad we found it. We will absolutely come back on our next visit to London.",

Had a Brie Walnut Souflee for an appetizer that was very gourmet!Both had the Fish 'n' Chips which were quintessentially perfect!
