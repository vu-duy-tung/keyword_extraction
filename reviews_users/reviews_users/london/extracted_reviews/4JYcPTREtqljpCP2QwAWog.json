    "text": "I have been to a wide variety of Indian restaurants here in London. In my experience, lunch buffets are popular in many of them, and they are cheap, usually priced in single digits.Thats why i was surprised when i saw the pricing at Bombay Brasserie. Lunch for \u00a322 per person. I guess they were charging a significant location premium.The interior decoration of this restaurant reminds me a bit of Chutney Mary, which is close by at Chelsea. There is a well decorated hall (with the walls adorned by old paintings and photographs of India and Indians) which opens to an area under the skylight. The food is placed here. I love skylights ... gives you the impression of being outdoors and at the same time protects you from the rain :)The food ranged from very good to above average. I suspect this isn't a place that Indian food purists would view favourably. This isn't traditional stuff. The preparations have been obviously altered to suit the European palate. But to me its always nice to try a different take on familiar items. For example one of the starters was a small uttapam with a dry prawn preparation on top. It was supposed to be had as a roll i believe. It was stunning. There were quite a few traditional and novel chaats among the starters, including pani puri and aloo tikki.The lamb was good. The chicken was good in terms of texture, but a bit too mild in my opinion. I am sure Britishers have a higher tolerance for spice now having been bombarded with curry for the last 2-3 decades. There was a substantial vegetarian section, but as is my nature, i didn't try much from that side besides the dal, which was fabulous.They serve you hot naans at the table once you have got your food. Overall the service level was high. The place gave me the feeling that it was one that aspires to be considered a high-end restaurant some day and they make suitable effort for that.Along with a glass of wine and the service charge, i paid ~\u00a330. Definitely on the higher side for lunch, but an interesting experience nevertheless.",

The Baingan dish (can't remember exact name) was served fancifully in the shell of the eggplant, and a tasty complement to the seabass.",

    "text": "Amazing. The attention to detail is incredible. While I've had authentic Indian food in many places, this has to be one of the most creative Nouveau Indian restaurants around. Yes, it's pricey. But I think it is worth, for example, \u00a34 to experience a plate of basmati rice with every grain separate, light and flavorful. In general, portions are smaller but equally unforgettable. \u00a0I asked the maitre 'd about the food preparation and it is time consuming. Worth every penny. \u00a0The Naan is served warm and isn't greasy, the chicken korma is \"fall apart\" tender yet served in whole pieces. No idea how they accomplish this, but frankly, I don't care as long as I can go back again. \u00a0Other things not to miss -- the grilled asparagus and the wine list. The comments about the food not being spice are only true if you forget to ask them to make it spicy. \u00a0If you like spicy food, make sure to raise your eyebrows, lean a little forward and say you want it \"Really spicy\". \u00a0The first night I just said spicy and it had a hint of heat. \u00a0The second night, things were appropriately firey.In the two consecutive nights I ate dinner there, service was excellent, the food was incredible and I left only wanting to come back again. \u00a0Absolutely brilliant!",

There is an extensive menu and vegetarians are well catered for. Being of the carnivore persuasion, I had the lamb rogan josh and was transported to tastebud heaven. My partner had chicken makhani and this was also delicious. The wine list is well thought out and the waiters offer excellent suggestions paring wine with your meal. I appreciated a few extra touches - you have a choice of chilled tap water instead of bottled water - I like their thinking of the environment and how this keeps costs down, there are poppdums and chutneys for you to enjoy at the start of your meal (a small charge is added to your bill for this) and with your main meal a serving of lentils and rice is provided, free of charge. A wonderful night out.",

I love spicy food, but Indian food is always a little spicier and hotter than I like - sometimes making it really hard to completely enjoy certain dishes. \u00a0In this case, I thought the basmati rice and chicken was spot on; nice little kick, but not too hot either.Overall, I gave Bombay Brasserie 4 stars for the combination of ambiance, flavor, and service. \u00a0Definitely will return on my next visit to London and would love to bring my wife and daughter here.",

The food's not bad at all; the drinks are yummy; the d\u00e9cor is gorgeous (especially the front bar); and the service better than you're likely to find at most places in London. BUT, Bombay Brasserie is ridiculously expensive and, to be completely honest, there are just too many superior curries out there at considerably more economical prices for me to ever bother with this upscale restaurant again. I suppose if you're staying in the adjoining hotel with an expense account \u00a0or really feel like spending too much money for a meal \u00a0then go for it.

    "text": "Recently renovated, the Bombay Brasserie is an absolutely stunning restaurant. We visited 2 weeks after they re-opened and from walking in to the bar area we knew we were in for a treat. After being seated in the bar we were handed a little drinks menu full of wonderful, and some slightly strange, sounding cocktails - our party of four all opted for something different. I had the Mango Bellini which was out of this world. My husband had a spicy cocktail (the name of which has left me) and it was delicious! We sat here for at least half an hour enjoying the ambience, the cocktails and the little snacks. We were led to our table and I gasped when we walked into the restaurant. Stunning. Whilst we spent a while deciding on our food and wine, we were given a platter of mini poppadums, cucumber, carrots, etc with a dip. Our choices of food were as follows:Starters: Crispy spinach with mango salsa. King prawns. Potato balls. Scallops. All delicious (especially the spinach). Mains: Chicken tikka with vinegar shallots. Black pepper chicken breasts. Lamb Shank. Seabass. 2x Basmati rice, 1x chickpea rice, 1x olive naan, 1x garlic naan. Again, all wonderful. Rice wasn't included with the main dish.Desserts: Nougat Ice cream. Masala Tea Custard. Tamarind Sorbet. The ice cream and custard were beautiful but the tamarind sorbet just didn't seem right for dessert! A little bit too spicy! We chose to have Voignier (at about \u00a327 a bottle) and Barolo (\u00a354). The whole evening was wonderful, but at just under \u00a3500 for the four of us (which did include 2 Barolos and 3 Voigniers) it was pricey. Not your ordinary Indian though and great if you like to try something a bit different. Average cost of cocktails \u00a311Average cost of starter \u00a311Average cost of mains \u00a321Average cost of dessert \u00a38",

That's daylight robbery. The space is stunning - but was deserted when we went on December 28th. A few stragglers dribbled in - and they were gearing up for a party. Still, at the amount we paid, they don't have to have many diners to turn a very handsome profit!We had the mulligatawny soup (spelling error on menu, I think!), the scallop/crab appetizer, the fish curry and the seekh kebab/ A mint paratha, some pulao rice and the afore mentioned mango bellinis. Raped 4 pounds for bottled water.The food was good, no doubt of that - well the fish curry was the weakest. It didn't seem like the fish was properly infused with the curry spices. So while the incandescent orange sauce was very flavorful, the fish had not picked up enough of it.I think the place is better in memory than in actuality. I'd rather pay 10 quid for the local take away - or get someone else to pay for lunch here!",

I went with a special group, so I didn't have the option to order off the menu, and our food was served family style. The appetizer was food that, while pretty, looks like it's been handled just a tad too much--certainly not typical presentation of Indian food. The main course was a disappointing and bland butter chicken, made better by the side dishes: delicious saag, suitably spicy rajma, and baskets of the impossible to mess up naan. Decent, but I've had better from small Balti houses in the countryside! \u00a0Finally: the dessert. Never, ever again. I know this was just my experience, but it was enough to turn me off of the Brasserie for good. Frozen rock solid ginger ice cream in a stale waffle shell, with berries. The extra additions to my dessert: a dark, curly hair AND a small, dead fly. Eeek!All I can say is that I had a bad experience, but I don't think this is a bad place. Would I go back? No. Would I recommend it? Possibly. Two stars for ambiance. The restaurant is beautiful, after all. And there's always a chance to spot a celeb! (If you're into that sort of thing, ya know.)",

Did I mention it's not spicy? It's expensive. And not spicy. And the restaurant is like what they think British people would want an Indian restaurant to be like: weird Hindi covers of western pop songs. Huh?Not authentic. Still tastes good, but for 15 pounds, I should have had a feast--a SPICY, flavorful, authentic feast. So if you are an unadventurous white person who has never had Indian food before, this might be a good first experience if you need to be eased into a different culinary option. But if you leave here thinking this is Indian food, you would be sadly mistaken. You are missing out on a world of amazing Indian foods! Nice staff, not gross food---but not authentic Indian food.",

Nothing interesting to make me want to dine here again. Barely any desserts and the menu was incredibly limited. They say that the ~celebrities~ dine here. Well I'm willing to bet Bombay Brasserie pays them to eat here because this place sucks.Service here is absolutely terrible. We arrived at 8:30 and didn't leave until around 11. We were the last customers to leave because our waiter was being a douchebag and didn't feel like giving us our bill. He did not once ask us if we wanted drinks, dessert or if everything was satisfactory. When I'm paying top pound to go to a restaurant I expect the service and food to be outstanding. Bombay was neither.The decor however is stunning. Plush chairs and small cushions if your on the booth side. Chandeliers adorn the ceiling and the walls are a warm inviting color. I can't say the same about the food.There is no way in hell I would ever waste my money on this crap again. Save your money and spend it on a chanel bag or two.",

BF had arranged for us to sit away from other guests with a very attentive waiter. We were in the most beautiful part of the restaurant. Every single detail was notable. Even the bathrooms were gorgeous! Not a surprise.The service was superb. The ambiance was amazing. The restaurant was beautiful. But if you are looking for an 'authentic' Indian dining experience, coming from an Indian, this is not it. The flavors are there but some dishes are hit or miss. The starters (some paneer dish) was lovely but the mains were rather uninspired. It's a nice treat to go there and I would go back because it's sentimental to me, we had a very special date there. But it was very formal in the sense that the dishes were smaller in portion size and the attention to detail was placed more on look than authenticity. But we can get authentic food at home. Here we'll come for something different and to try their twist on classic versions of dishes when we're in the mood to go back for sake of memory. The prices are well...pricey...so, don't expect a traditional curry served family style. You're getting a plated dish that's pretty and put together.Overall, we would probably go back. But not very often. It's worth a second shot. I want to see if they can do better than our first visit.",

Hey if it works it works, but why not invest in better food?3. The service was absolutely terrible. First thing the hostess doesn't bother saying even a hello and hands me a drinks menu and walk off. After ordering, the food was burning my throat and they wouldn't pay any attention to the table whisky walking around and serving other tables next to us. We had to keep asking for more water. Hint: maybe leave the water bottle bro!4. Even to pay, I had to get their attention and the food was very over priced \u00a0perhaps cuz of the location. 5. Honestly speaking in blunt American: this place is catered to wealthy upper class white people, who might not know that there's hole in the wall places serving better And real Indian food and not some Campbell's tomato soup with chicken and calling it a chicken tikka! Don't waste your money, you can make better Indian food at home. Believe me I have! Thanks ladies!",

Truly incredibly against the sweetness of the chutneys and pomegranates. For my main, I had the daal that was made with cream and butter - so how could it be anything but delicious? - and the okra. Okra is one of those vegetables that you really can screw up by one simple mistake. And they cooked it beautifully. I honestly could have eaten the entire serving of both, and then some, but I had to exercise a little bit of self control, which is beyond difficult when being served such delicious food.",

As you walk through the saloon doors, you are greeted by an breathtakingly beautiful chandelier and main dining room with its own resident pianist - who was amazing to listen to! We then were guided into their conservatory for brunch. Loved the relaxed, bright airy feel and decor in the conservatory! We kicked off proceedings with a visit to the chaat stand - Bombay Brasserie's take on the street food stalls in India serving quick bite-sized snacks. I had the full selection of: bhel puri, coconut prawns, pani puri with vegetable pakora and a tandoor cooked chicken in a dill marinade - a very colourful, and tasty, start to my brunch experience. We especially loved the coriander and cumin crust on the talapia, comfort of the soft, pillowy paneer and the spicy hit from the gunpowder potatoes. Now, as we have a sweet tooth, we had actually checked out the dessert selection even before visiting the chaat stand; can you fault us?! Amazing desserts on offer, including chikki (caramel brittle) and mango and fig kulfis, chocolate shrikhand (a strained yoghurt dessert), warm gulab jamun, and exotic fruit selection. Plus unusual dessert twists: Beetroot cake and tender coconut raisin kheer (rice pudding). As I said before, we are dessert people and always check out menus and buffets to save space for those sweet delights at the end, so we particularly loved the mango and fig kulfi, as it had such an intense flavour! We would recommend visiting for both the ambiance and also to enjoy refined Indian cuisine with traditional, warm Taj Hotels Group service. Recommend visiting, especially for celebrations!",

    "text": "I went to BB for their buffet this past weekend and was quite disappointed. I hadn't been for years since they did a refit, and it really felt like a 4* hotel buffet (4 star as a pejorative; the difference between a 4 star and 5 star hotel buffet is like chalk and cheese).The service is pleasant, and obviously rather unimportant for a buffet, though as in my last visit years ago, there is an old-world ostentation which I don't like. There is a sense that the owners and staff think of BB on par with a 3 michelin starred restaurant, rather than an all-you-can-gorge Indian restaurant.Food was pleasant, but the lack of choice was surprising. 1 lamb, 1 chicken, 1 chicken tikka skewer, 1 prawn curry, dal, and perhaps 2-3 vegetables. That is more than sufficient, and perhaps i'm spoiled by North American buffet standards, but a stand-alone Indian restaurant with a buffet should offer more variety than I would usually order for delivery for 4.Naan bread delivered to table was objectively bad -- lumpy, doughy, and quite unpleasant.Food was quite good, but again, not any more thoughtfully prepared than my local delivery, and certainly not on par with the Michelin Indian contingent. For whatever it cost (around \u00a330) I'd much rather Quilon or Benares lunch deal, or full price spread at Trishna.",

    "text": "varunlivesfood.comDish Recommendations: Palak Chaat, Chicken XacutiMy next stop on my hunt for the best Indian food in London is Bombay Brasserie!The dining area is super nice! It's the same vibe you get in similarly upscale hotels in Bombay like the Taj, Oberoi, etc. There was a beautiful adjoining room with a glass roof for natural sunlight and plants hanging from the ceiling. There was also a private garden with a long table which would be great for parties and dinners.DishesWe started with a papad platter with a kind of tamarind chutney. Pretty basic stuff but it was a nice complimentary snack after a long day of classes.Chicken tikka for starters. Everyday I wake up in the morning hoping that it will be the day that I taste chicken tikka that will fill the void that has been created by moving out of Bombay. I was disappointed yet again. To give it credit, it was still better than the shit people serve me in literally every restaurant in the US. It was mildly flavorful. But it was still a bit chewy and lacked the punch of heat and spice in your mouth. It definitely did not melt away as it should. Ah well, its hard to find something to match the Bombay standard for chicken tikka.I enjoyed the Palak Chaat quite a lot. It was light, crispy, and flavorful. The yogurt was smooth and creamy. It had all the basic necessities to make good chaat; crunch, tang, spice.I made a slight error in ordering main courses. I didn't vary the base of the dishes enough, resulting in three red sauces. I usually try to mix it up with a green saag base or a white cashew based gravy. They were still varied enough though.Everyone's favorite was the chicken xacuti. A Goan special, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it on the menu. I love the spicy, tangy, tamarind and coconut based dish. There's no specific way the dish is made. You'll find a million variations use within Goa. I'll definitely order it again. Paneer makhani was nice. It was subtly sweet, super creamy, and nicely flavored. It's just what I look for. I don't like when its made super spicy, I don't think thats the point of the dish at all.Kerala Halibut Curry was pretty meh. Served with a traditional thin gravy, it lacked a lot of flavor. It seemed to be pretty mild and uninspired with lumps of over cooked halibut floating about it in. Would not recommend.The Chicken Biryani was not bad actually. I'm not 100% sure that it was made in the tradition way (layered rice and chicken in a massive pot). It was well flavored and spicy. It went well with the xacuti.We got a basic kulfi for dessert which was a lot more like ice cream than kulfi.But you know its a good restaurant when they have saunf for your after meal mouthfreshener!I would go back for sure. It was reasonably priced and I had a great time for sure!",

I asked for the chicken dum biryani and raita, so that's all I have to benchmark their food on. The biryani was mildly spiced with whole spices and had a lot of chicken pieces in it - it looked very appetizing and was flavorful, fragrant & really tasty. At \u00a315 it's on the expensive side, but the portion was enough for two people. Now the raita was not really a raita (which has other condiments like onions, coriander etc.). This was a thick yogurt with chaat masala - and I really missed the other ingredients that go into making a complete raita.They also charged a 12.5% service charge on takeaway, which I thought was odd.",

The food was good, but I have had much better curries and Indian food in general in much cheaper restaurants.Service was borderline bad, our food arrived before our bottle of wine and drinks, chasing a waiter to get the wine took a bit of time and the same can be said for dessert.All in all, not worth the visit, especially in London with all those Indian restaurants that are far better",

Food was delicious, if slightly hotter than we are used to and the portion sizes werwas perfect. Speed was excellent and the pianist was a lovely touch. Recommended!",

    "text": "Excellent service, amazing interior design, food was okay. We stayed at a nearby hotel and they told us to try Bombay Brasserie for Indian food so we went. We didn't know it would be a \u00a330 per person buffet but that was fine. When you walk in, you are wowed by the atmosphere. They really excel at presenting a luxurious environment. Except the food was only okay. On the day we went they were serving mostly North Indian cuisine (although for dinner they serve a la cart\u00e9 which we would have much rather preferred) and we weren't that excited. My mom found the main dishes to all taste similarly and it was hard to know what you're doing in terms of putting together the appetizers and salads. It's very authentic, but almost a bit too authentically specific for the average traveler who just wants Indian food. The desserts were pretty good though. Overall I really enjoyed the appetizers and the desserts and tried everything once. The main courses were the only disappointments though. Would come back again only for dinner and not for the lunch buffet.",
