For breakfast you can either turn up and sit at the front, or you can book the back area of the restaurant which I would recommend - it's more spacious and calmer. They do everything from cooked english to pancakes and maple syrup, eggs benedict, fruit salad and crumpets with nutella. With Portobello Road market right outside it's a great place to go for brunch on the weekend before you check out the market and surrounding area of Notting Hill and Westbourne Grove.",

Will be passing on my thoughts to others as much as possible.",

(awesome but CRAZY).We came in and were seated immediately. \u00a0Ordered a few drinks which came very quickly. \u00a0We ordered:Quinoa and avo salad (surprisingly yummy and awesome). \u00a0This is a great dish to have for a light lunch.Avocado with chili toast and poached egg : Wowser, the avo was so fresh and juicy. I loved it, and the perfectly poached egg and chili was a great complement.Two of my friends got the cheeseburger, which apparently was outstanding and the hot dog, which was less exciting. \u00a0It was awesome, we had a kid with us and they actually totally catered to him. \u00a0We were in a rush and wanted to take his ice cream to go and they went out of their way to find a to - go cup for him.

Came here for brunch with a few Friends and none of us really looked into the place, so we were a little more than pleasantly surprised to find such a great brunch place!As soon as we walked in the place was buzzing. There was a small seating area outside and lots of booths and a bar inside. We were seated immediately and It was refreshing not having to queue at \u00a0this popular 'no reservation' dinner.I'm going to plagiarise a popular tip that I read which went something like \"you should really punch your self in the face if you don't order the Bloody Mary here'. By far the best Bloody Mary that I have ever had! And trust me, I've had a few :) The menu was delicious, we were all spoilt for choice. They've got some great veggie friendly options like the avocado on toast and quinoa with spinach. I'd definitely like to come back and try their burger too.The service was amazing- I particularly liked that our waiter slipped in and took a seat at our booth while helping us pick our order. Too intimate? Naaah! The only downside is that its a bit of a trek to get to as its quite far away from the tube- but it is completely worth it! Loved, loved, loved!",

They have green juices and all of that as well. I tried the egg + salmon combo once and the egg tasted rather weird. My friend, being able to see the kitchen, pointed out that they weren't cooking actual eggs but rather some red liquid... I found that weird? It's good but no eggs for me anymore, and it is a little pricey (\u00a330+ for two people for brunch). Almost forgot! Great bloody Mary's \u00a0And sweet potato fries! But again, noisy inside, weird egg thing and high prices award this place 3 stars",

Came on a Sunday... didn't have reservations, so had to wait a little over half an hour, but thankfully we got some seats outside where we could wait. Got seated at the bar. Now, if you're always cold, GOOD, this is the place for you. With the fires all on and the heat of the kitchen, you could feel it all. If you're not always cold... well, it can get you a little flustered. It was quite hot there, I was afraid my glass of water would soon start boiling. I got the huevos rancheros and my friend got the eggs benedict. Now let me caveat this by saying I lived in Texas for 9 years, so my standard for huevos rancheros are pretty high. They were good... but the dish was missing rice and didn't have much sauce. Quite yummy overall, but didn't fill me up either. I actually got food envy looking at my friend's 2 eggs benedict (which were also yummy). Since I hadn't quite filled up on the eggs, got 2 scoops of ice cream for dessert -- chocolate and honeycomb, which were GREAT!",

Particularly impressed with our water glasses being refilled regularly.So my 5 stars are to stay, and I hope so is this Portobello institution.I went for pre-Christmas drinks last year and was very happy to return for a meal tonight. My friend and I both opted for chicken dishes, both delicious. Mind you, mine should have come with a warning that they expect you to eat the honey-fried chicken with your fingers. I managed to tackle the pile of sticky chicken pieces with cutlery \u00a0probably a good thing as it was so delicious I would have devoured it far too quickly otherwise. Hashbrowns and roasted broccoli were excellent side dishes.To have a pudding after all this food was pure greed; the lemon meringue pie that arrived was American super-size, but \u00a0guess what \u00a0so delicious I finished most of it, too. Luckily the espresso is nice and strong! Apart from the area's best and most exciting cinema, The Electric also comprises a private members club and an excellent bar/restaurant.Having popped in for breakfasts and snacks so many times, I had almost forgotten just how excellent a place for dinner The Electric is.Following the previous night's disappointment at Tibits, last night's dinner at The Electric made up and left a good impression of British cuisine on my friends.We had a lovely, attentive waiter and chose a selection of lovely foods. I shared some excellent merquez with yoghurt/mint dip and had the most delicious chicken & leek pie. So much succulent meat and seasoned with tarragon, my favourite herb.Everything else looked great \u00a0happy faces and round bellies all round. Really glad to see a place this popular for people watching also really delivering on the food.",

    "text": "The brasserie isn't itself a private club, not that you can tell from the attitude of some of the staff, though the 'House' upstairs is. An intermittently appealing spot for mid-week coffee and brunch, it's a 'destination' for the wrong reasons on market days.The venue is looking a little tatty around the edges now. Battered zinc tables and dark wood stretch down the side of a long open bar and kitchen, opening up into a wider dining space at the back like a calm pool behind the frenetic waterfall. We were booked into the front though 'bumped' to the backroom following a whispered argument about a 20 minute wait from the party queuing in front of us. On a weekday this would be annoying, out of sight is out of mind to the whirling wait staff. On a Saturday, the chaos front of house means a back table is preferable. A snake of expectant hipsters rubberneck at your plates as they wait at the front desk, always in the way of the dfsgrgaergasergsaergThe brunch menu is full of solid fare; full English and Vegetarian breakfasts with varying combinations, muffins, bacon and eggs in numerous combinations. As well as the obvious dishes, there are a fair few favourites from the full menu including fish or steak and chips and their passable fish pie. Avocado and poached egg on granary toast is a game choice, more avocado than anything else, but a relatively healthy way to cure a hangover. The Eggs Royale were a little disappointing despite their initial visual promise. Beautiful golden yolked eggs served atop a mountain of salmon with hollandaise sauce coating and dripping onto the muffin below. The ingredients were faultless, but with one egg virtually hard boiled and the other's unset albumen having barely been cooked, it was clear that the eye for detail wasn't covering all of the dishes to leave the kitchen.It's tough to damn somewhere for one undercooked egg, and I'm not going to. I've had some wonderfully relaxing breakfasts sat at the front of the Brasserie and a couple of reasonable lunches too, I'd just recommend avoiding it at the weekend and leave it to the tourists. If you are in the area on a weekend, it's well worth a wander down to the unfashionable end of the market to the lower reaches of Golbourne Road to the street food stalls and the wonderful pastries at the Lisboa Patisserie. It's one of several tiny Portuguese bakeries and cafes along the road and (relatively) untouched by the encroaching gentrification. Their pastel de nata are small egg custard gems, well worth the trip for a half dozen to take away and a much tastier egg than you'll find elsewhere.",

And why is it that you have to buy a bag of 400 maltesers, rather than the usual size packet? Oh and pay \u00a36 for it? So compared to the above, a visit to the Electric Cinema, which adjoins its sister eaterie,the Electric Brasserie, is refreshing. When I visited the other night, my friend and I were able to settle down to a pretty good meal of chicken and leek pie and mash followed by melt-in-the-mouth mango sorbet. It's a pretty noisy place on a saturday night, with the din of drinkers at the bar and cacophanous open kitchen to contend with, but definitely buzzing. We got the bill and then one of the lovely managers, Mike, offered to go and pick up our tickets and escort us through the back of the brasserie directly into the cinema's auditorium. So civilisedand not a tortilla in sight.",

I realize this is common practice in London (or so I hear) but it's considered very rude in the States to give an end time to your meal, unless an exception has been made for your reservation time. And to deliver it repeatedly felt very rude, when we were only five minutes off our time. Still, the mussels were very good, as was the house red wine and the salad. The atmosphere was lively and err electric, so very much enjoyed being a part of the community for a short while. Would return, during an off-peak hour",

We then had another waiter who came across a little stand-offish and a smart arse towards me and my date, especially when she was ordering wine, which I didn't like. Food was nice enough, but way overpriced. When you are paying that kind of money I expect pleasant waiters.",

On stopping by we were told there would be an hour wait, no problem - they took out number and promised to call as soon as the table was ready. We went off exploring the local stalls and shops.When seated we were welcomed by a very friendly waitress, to cover it off all in all she was great. I went for the cheese burger with bacon added and an oreo milkshake.Oh lordy lord....the milkshake was tremendous. Lots of oreo chunks and a good consistency. tasty!The burger was a double patty both very thin, layered with cheese and pickles. YUM! while not a big rare burger this was meaty and tasty and made for a great lunch!A visit here is highly JD Recommended!",

    "text": "Wow wow wow wow wow.That was a summary of my experience at the Electric Diner. We came for a late lunch and if I had more time in England I would definitely go back for brunch as it seems to be the most popular way to go here.Atmosphere is really good, a bit closer to a real diner than that chain of Diners you find around London. Of course it doesn't quite get to the charm of a real diner (I keep saying real diner, I mean the diners in New Jersey, Land of the Diners - more like greasy spoons than fun hipster spots). But a really cool place to come into from a cold winters day. Also the booths are really comfy.I took the plunge with their bone marrow and beef cheek jam. I wanted to go safe with a burger or something but it just kept calling to me. And oh wow was it good! Tip: The menu just says 'bone marrow and beef cheek jam' without any sides so you might assume that's what you get and order a side of their mash. Unless you're starving, refrain - it comes with LOADS of well made toast!My dining partner got the chicken and squash salad and it looked so beautiful and she said it was delicious! She also got some chips on the side which I sampled and loved. I also had a latte, and I normally don't have high expectations for restaurant coffee but this was very nice!Food comes out quickly and you can sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook in front of you! Service is nothing to write home about but that's about standard for London. Prices are reasonable for London but way too expensive for a real diner - but then the food here is fabulous and much more posh. You won't make a mistake by deciding to eat here.",

A few months and a few miles to the southeast have me craving the single cheeseburger (double patties) with pickles, onions, sauce, and good ol' French's mustard way too often. And there's certainly nothing like it in SE1! Everything else from before still rings true. Also note: on weekdays, if you go before 11am for breakfast or before 7pm for dinner and get the loyalty card, the bill is half-priced. It's gotta be one of the better deals in West London!",

This was very disappointing and I should have spoken to them at the time for an explanation. It was very rubbery and the shape of it suggested it had been cooked in a mould. It felt very artificial, not the fresh, light and fluffy one I was expecting and hoping for. All our food came very quickly, almost too quickly.Having said all of that we would both go back - I'd just make a different choice.

To find an excellentbreakfast makes things a little more complicated, and to find an excellent breakfast at a reasonable price can be a real challenge. Throw in great service and a venue that says 'experience' rather than just a seat to plonk yourself down on, requires trawling through endless online reviews and in-depth analyses. Elegant yet simply prepared. Photos: Rosie HillsdonAll you have to do is head towards Portobello Road, West London, and find yourself sat in the gloriously comfortable leather booths of the Electric Diner. Providing a brilliant array of dishes that your taste buds seem to anticipate just from staring at the menu, the newly-opened Electric Diner combines the comforts of the traditional American diner with a French underground edge.The December winter morning was firmly left outside as we deliberated over our menu choices with our waiter. We were told that the plates were large and meant for sharing, so we chose avocado on toast with chilli and poached egg, and an open-faced ham, cheese fondue with fried egg. Recommended to us also came the thick peppered bacon and hash browns as side orders. Elegant yet simply prepared, all four of these dishes had a unique twist that perfectly reflected the eccentricity of the diner, not to mention that they were all absolutely delicious. The Croque Monsieur-esque ham and cheese fondue gets a special mention.A collaborative effort between Chicago-based chef Brendan Sodikoff and the Soho House Group, the Electric Diner caters for every customer, even if it is just for a cup of Darlington's coffee. The restaurant was buzzing by 10am, and the staff was efficient, unobtrusive and never missed the opportunity to refill your glass.Though at the higher end of reasonably-priced, there is no doubt that the creatively cooked fresh products, served with friendly professionalism, was well worth it. A second visit is definitely on the cards to try their 'All Day Menu' served after 12pm, and a little later to try the wonderfully-named cocktail 'Chasing Maria'.Rosie HillsdonFood: 18/20Drinks: 16/20Service: 19/20The Electric Diner: 53/60Electric Diner, 191 Portobello Road London W11 2ED is open from 8am for 'Breakfast', 12pm onwards for the 'All Day Menu', and is open until 1am at the weekend.

I'm also into the quinoa salad which is a healthier but very tasty option. Smashed potatoes loaded with garlic and butter-y goodness is clearly a no-brainer.

Slight issue with the attire for waiters / waitresses-- i'm pretty sure the only requirement is black shirt so we are often asking other patrons black shirts for our check in vain.",

We saw lots of delicious looking plates come past us while we were waiting for ours. I was certainly not disappointed with my scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. Huge portion of really tasty smoked salmon (I find smoked salmon hit and miss as it can sometimes be a bit tough or stringy). The eggs were very light and fluffy and also plentiful. Service was relatively quick but not super friendly. It wouldn't stop me returning. Next time I'd rather sit in a booth as the bar is a bit cramped and there's nowhere to put your bag if you have one.",

If it has, it's been a very subtle, un-noticeable one. My usual order was the flat iron chicken, but the last time or so I'd ordered it the sauce was watery and it was overpowered with garlic, leaving little else taste. \u00a0 They use to do the most incredible lemon meringue pie too, but it seems that came off the menu pretty quickly - which is unfortunate, as the door stop sized slice you were given was not only incredibly delicious but also great value for money. \u00a0 The decor of course, it lovely, great leather bound booth seating with dim atmospheric lighting even during the day. The bar is a great place to sit and people watch everyone shopping on Portobello road too. Which I feel is the one saving grace to this place. \u00a0 Stop for a drink or three, maybe avoid the food.",

I LOVE BRUNCH!!Honestly, this had to have been one of the best meals I've had in London, and the fact that it was brunch and I was drinking made it all the more better. A classmate of mine invited me out to brunch and decided to take me here since I've never been to Notting Hill before. Located right next to the Electric Cinema is this place, and renamed it Electric Diner. Apparently, there was a fire and they had to close for a while but are now reopened. Funny story about that to follow...So, we started off with drinks. My friend ordered the Bloody Mary and I ordered the Horse's Back since I don't like Bloody Mary's. When the BM arrived at the table, I was like \"DAMNNNNNNNN!\" That drink was so beautiful... artfully crafted to perfection, and garnished with a bazillion pickles on top. Of course I tried it, and I thought it was really good. Never liked a BM until this one, true story. My Horse's Back wasn't bad, super strong and had a kick to it, especially being the first thing that entered my stomach for the day.As for the food, I was really impressed with my dish, simply called open-faced ham, cheese fondue, and fried egg. I gobbled it all up because it was so amazing. My friend ordered the ham steak and green eggs which also looked good. Seriously, I'm coming back here for brunch, it's SOOOO GOOD!So, during our meal the fire alarm kept going off. Sort of getting in the way of our lovely meal, but it wasn't really that big of a deal. Eventually, management came over and apologized and politely kicked us out because they had to do an inspection. Oh, but what else? They told us the meal was taken care of. A FREEEEEE MEAL?!!! Hell yeah! Score! Touchdown! Victory danceeeee, babyyyyy. YUP. We were TWO happy brunchers. And yup, we'll be back for more soon.",

The restaurant is decorated in 50's shabby chic and it really set a fun, but cool mood to the place.The waitress was very nice and patient. Some of our group wanted to make changes to the standard menu items and she was only happy to comply. I had the quinoa salad, which had grapes and feta and almonds. It sounded like a weird combo on the menu, but it tasted really light and refreshing. I stole a bite of a burger and it was delicious! Very moist and the cheese was not over powering. It was also nice to see a bun hold together. Stuffed to the max, we decided to throw caution to the wind and got the chocolate pie. It was a very rich chocolate tart with an oreo cookie base. The portion was huge and we just about managed to finish it between two of us. The service, food, and ambiance were great and I can't wait to come back and try some more of their food options!!!",

My friend ordered the salmon fillet & mash. Let's just say, they should've let the chicken on just a tad bit longer, but the flavor of the au jus was very good. The hashbrowns were fried a nice golden brown & the broccoli was well, broccoli (I find it very hard to eat veggies in Europe). My friend's salmon smelled fishy, but she seemed pleased & scarfed down her mashed potatoes like her life depended on it. So overall, the food was good but I don't believe the price was very fair. \u00a317 for JUST flat-iron chicken?! I digress. . . The service: We were greeted as soon as we walked in were told to sit wherever we like. Our waitstaff were very attentive and answered our questions well. They didn't check up on us much, but I much prefer that so that we can enjoy our meal without the awkward smile when they ask if it was ok. They did ask if were were pleased afterwards though which I appreciated. All-in-all this place scores average in my eyes, but I really liked the people so 4 stars it is!",

I happened to take a look at their menu, as I did with the other restaurants near by, to observe what type of food they had (and compared prices). They had a Michelin plaque on the outside wall, underneath the menu, which caught my attention. The food menu seemed very similar to that of American breakfast back in California.The prices were very fair, and was a little more on the affordable side compared to nearby restaurants.Now for the food:Holy $H!T!!! The mashed potatoes were the BEST I have ever had in my LIFE! I had the chicken and waffles (also ordered the thick cut bacon on the side - I would have been much more happier with the mashed potatoes as my added side order). The chicken was really crunchy crisp, and flaky. They use dark meat, and had a huge flavor spectrum on that plate.We also ordered the flat-iron chicken (added a side of mashed potatoes - a must!) it was amazing! The Au jus that came with is was so amazing! This entire meal was just very nostalgic to my childhood flavors, but on crack (because it was more amazing!). We had leftovers, and I was extremely happy to have had a couple bites of the mashed potato in the morning because f!!! It was still so f!!!!!!!! Good!",

The waiter saw us but was apparently slammed with other tables.Once we ordered we had to ask twice for tap water. At long last our food arrived and my single cheeseburger was actually a double. I was too hungry to send it back and decided to chow down!Food was decent. Nothing special about my burger with just cheese and pickles. No lettuce or tomato and anything else would have cost extra. Fries were good and plenty. My friend was also hungry to eat her vegetarian breakfast, a hearty meal although a steep price.I don't feel the burger was worth \u00a314 without fries.

I know tequila cocktails and hardboiled eggs might not be for everyone, but they're for me. Blessed be, my specific tastes are on trend. Their full meal menu also looks fab, but I haven't strayed. Pull up to the window or sit right out front and watch the people go by. Lovely loos, too.",

We spent those extra moments indulging in French onion soup & Fries Au Cheval at Electric Diner's bar. Satisfyingly rich & fatty comestibles. Love the idea of fries accompanied by mornay, an egg, & aioli. 3.75 stars for food. Electric Diner is a happening place! Speak loudly to get your order across & enjoy the chaotic, but organized dance of the cooks behind the bar if you're seated there. This busy energy unfortunately translated into some confusion in their service. There was a lag in all things from ordering to getting the bill. We asked for to-go containers & my fries were placed in a container not suitable for takeout. Meh, would consider returning knowing i'd have to carve out more than a half an hour for a meal here.",

    "text": "YES!!!!!!!!! We were in the area to hit up the antique market on a Saturday and wanted to get breakfast nearby. Easily the best Full English I had while I was in town. Perfectly poached eggs, sausage, black pudding, and beans were on point. The toast was super thick and served with butter, strawberry jelly and jam. That bacon though, probably the best bacon I have shoved down my gullet. Thick with a nice smoky flavor. I will think about this meal for years to come. Great location if you plan to do some shopping on Portobello Road. We were able to catch two seats along their front window facing the street. We just sat and watched all the comings and goings of the market while enjoying our amazing breakfast. I highly recommend the ED for breakfast and we plan to return when we are in town again.",

The meat was tasty but it was lacking some punch perhaps becaus there was no onions or shallots which usually take part in the tartare as I know it but I will forgive them as overall it was still good!",

I don't love uber sweet foods, and they did this just right. My friend had a double cheeseburger along with the fries au chavel. It was a large portion of fries with a mild creamy sauce, garlic aioli to dip them in, topped with a fried egg. They were pretty good! We also ordered a side of roasted broccoli (in butter) to be healthy...For drinks, the Root to Mule (Moscow Mule with gin) was awesome! GET THE CHOCOLATE & WHISKEY POT A' LA CREMA for dessert!The vibe is awesome! The service is great and the music was perfect. I highly recommend eating here! Check them out.",

Sold.Totally relaxed vibe with friendly service.I tried the pea and mint soup which was warm, savory and delicious. I next had the crab gnocchi which had a chunky tomato sauce that was really yummy and not heavy like gnocchi can often be. For dessert the incredible lemon meringue pie is great for sharing. I also had a bite of a yummy rhubarb cheesecake.Oh wait, a ate a few perfectly crunchy French fries too!",
