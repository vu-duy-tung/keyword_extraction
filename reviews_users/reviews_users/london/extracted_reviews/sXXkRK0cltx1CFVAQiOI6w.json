The pros with this restaurant were that they were very flexible. Whilst most other places at this time of year require confirmed numbers and meals pre-selected before sitting Boulevard Bar Brasserie were happy to flex our numbers and didn't require us to pre-select meals. Though this worked well on the one hand (as it turned out numbers for us kept fluctuating as people went off sick etc.) it also worked to our disadvantage with delays in our meal coming out. Between our starters and mains there must have been at least an hour if not more to wait. In this time a good deal of wine was consumed as you can imagine as we waited for our food so probably the restaurant was happy. Service was pretty good considering how many of us were there. Food was fairly ordinary and my turkey seemed a tad dry and overcooked. Not gigantic portions so even after our desserts a number of us were still fairly peckish. Overall not too bad for lunch for Christmas but at the price we paid I've experienced better.",

Been a few times, and it's always done the business - pleasant food, reasonable wine list, and sensible prices. The food, while good, is not going to blow you away - it's standard brasserie fare - though the tasty foccacia-style bread you get to start (unless you go for the set menu) sitting glistening on a massive board on your way in is guaranteed to get your tastebuds going (and your hackles rising when you realise it's not for set menu customers). The waiter when we went a couple of days ago was a bit offhand, and took our order sans pen. However, this backfired when he brought us the wrong food - which, for a set menu with a choice of only 3 items per course, doesn't give a good impression. It's awful to say it, but I left feeling full, but bored. Perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for a brasserie, perhaps for a \u00a315 set menu that's all you can expect. None of the food was bad, but none of it had any wow factor. Next time, I think I'll go for a glass of wine, and see if I can persuade them to sell me a hunk of foccacia.",

You could see the theatre from the brasserie and its location was amazing. We used the tastecard here and were not at all discriminated against for it not did we encounter any problems with payment. We both had the whole tiger prawns in garlic butter and thought the food was lovely but a little on the small side in terms of portion size. We then had dessert: apple and rhubarb crumble with icecream for me and eton mess for my mother which they took the shortbread off of because of her allergy. The staff were absolutely wonderful and were very helpful with allergen advice in terms of their menu. Lovely pre-theatre food and would happily go just for lunch or dinner.",

I ordered the Fois Gras & Chicken Liver parfait. Was nice, nothing amazing.Then I ordered the Moules & Frites. Since it is Lent, I've given up cream & cheese (yes, I know how absurd that is), I requested the cream be taken out, which they did accordingly. It was quite mundane (compared to Belgo's). There was barely any jus and it was just quite salty. Maybe due to the lack of cream? The mussels themselves were quite small, not as beefy as Belgo's... I know if I want Moules & Frites Belgo's is the only place to go. I ate my giant cauldron of mussels, again it was nice. Nothing spectacular.I like this place and I'd probably go there again. It has a nice relaxed atmosphere. The table was booked for 2pm, we did not leave till about 5.30pm and never felt rushed to leave. Which was nice of them seeing as most places would start to usher you our after 2 hours.",

It's not bad, but certainly nothing special either.With a supposedly French menu (although some things look remarkably british or from further afield) Boulevard offers a really safe choice for a safe price. Food we ordered included sea bass (good, recommendable), steak and frites (average, wouldn't bother) and for deserts creme brulee (ok) and chocolate tart (average again, wouldn't bother).As you may have gathered by now, I'm not the biggest fan of the restaurant. This may be caused by the fact they forgot my reservation last time I went and made me wait outside for half an hour. They did make up for it by a free glass of kir royale but by then the damage was already done. The restaurant features on cheap deals websites with 50% offers. This implies that the food isn't anything special but at least gives you a cheap deal. For that reason I would come back. As I said, Boulevard certainly isn't bad, it's just too bad they cannot offer something a bit more exciting in the crowded London restaurant scene.",

The food was cooked well but nothing spectacular or extravagant. For example, I had the filet steak with dauphinois potato and peppercorn sauce. It wasn't beautifully presented for the \u00a319.95 price tag, and I personally found the sauce and the potato too salty. However, the steak was cooked to perfection as I had ordered.I do highly recommend the dessert. I had the fruit crumble with creme anglaise (seasonal), my partner had ther petit au chocolat, and our friends shared the sticky toffee pudding. We couldn't resist but to have a taste of each other's choices as they all looked so good (and tasted just as good as they looked).The French waitress who served us was very energetic, bubbly, and friendly, although service was slow at times as she seemed to be the only one covering the downstairs area. This is a \"safe\" restaurant to go to if you are in the area and don't know where to eat. The food is cooked well and the staff very friendly. It's not great value for money but you will walk out with a satisfied tummy.",

    "text": "Boulevard is tucked away behind the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and just to the side of the busy Covent Garden Piazza. It's a cute little place and can probably be best described as simple and safe. Nothing on the menu will surprise you. It's the usual French fare: mussels and frites, steak and frites, basic sandwiches, burgers, I think veal was probably the most unusual thing on the menu. But simple doesn't exactly mean bad, and Boulevard has always delivered on service and quality whenever I've been.My last visit was for a civilised stag do, late on a Saturday night, around 10pm. They quickly accommodated around seven of us and we ordered starters and mains that came quickly and were on the whole pretty good. My deep fried Camembert was a little on the small size for a starter but I soon filled up on the mussels and frites for main course. The chips were a bit limp and a little too oily, but they were ok..Boulevard Brassiere isn't going to set the culinary world alight anytime soon. But it can definitely be relied upon for safe, simple food and some good quality wine. A good place to eat after some shopping or maybe pre or post theatre. Worth a visit, pleasant, but won't blow you away anytime soon.",

    "text": "A return trip to Boulevard Brasserie and still quite consistentent in dishing up generous portions of good quality classic French dishes. The only thing that has changed is their front of house team which are more friendly and approachable. Rabbit and pork terrine. Very well composed. The bouncy texture gave it a satisfying bite, light seasoning to allow the sweetness of the meat to pull through. A lovely side of crunchy pickled carrots to add a refreshing touch and a contrast in texture.Duck liver parfait This was lovely and rich with the port jelly giving it a subtle sweetness and the taste of wine. It was incredibly creamy as if it's melting when spreading it across the toast. The grilled fig accentuated another level of sweetness as well as adding moisture. Delicious and good quality.Potted smoked salmon rillettes This was okay. creamy and chunky but lacking the sweetness of the salmon due to overpowering flavour of dill and capers. Was nice but wish I could taste the salmon more.A fine petite casserole of clams, mussels and chorizo. The tomato flavoured broth was lovely and well spiced, mainly from the chorizo which gave it strong notes of paprika and a good punch of heat. Nice herbs added for depth and flavour. Mussels aren't in season yet so they were a bit small but even so, they remained soft and plump and same goes for the clams although half of them had fallen out the shells and some into the broth.Seafood linguine A fantastic dish. A generous amount of mussels and clams. It also came with two large prawns that were incredibly fresh and bouncy. Linguine was cooked perfectly so dente in a lovely herby olive oil sauce. It was all seasoned nicely with good burst of zesty flavours from the uncooked cherry tomatoes and refreshing textures from the fresh spinach leavesBoeuf bourguignon & mash. This was a very comforting dish. Generous amount of braised beef that was nice and tender with complex flavousr coming from the shallots and mushrooms although the latter were slightly overcooked it lost its bounce. The added lardons added depth and a richer flavour to the broth which itself was perfectly seasonedBeer battered cod and chips Quite a scam as it was definitely not cod and probably whiting instead. The meat was not as firm and a more mushy texture although fresh and the batter was not crisped enough. Fries however were nice and fluffy, crisp exterior and greaseless. Leg of duck confit This was slightly overcooked becoming dry around the outside and losing a lot of the softer tender meat that it had in the inside. Luckily the lost of moisture was filled by the nice soft stew of lentils and mushrooms and nice addition of lardons added extra flavour. Seasoning was on the salty side though.Roasted vegetables These were lovely and herby, seasoned nicely, sweet whilst remaining its crunchy texture for those who like a nice bite from their vegetables like us.Even went we went in a group of four, service and food was still on par. It's nice for them to have a menu suitable for everyone with good vegetarian options as well as an afternoon tea menu too. The place looks pretty fancy but if you book it via Opentable you can usually get 50% off food which makes it a great place for group dining without suffering the high cost to impress. I've visit this place at least once a year and it's still yet to let me down.",

    "text": "With a set menu of 2 courses for \u00a317.50, located in Central London, Boulevard Brasserie is not a bad spot for dinner. However the 2-course deal must be starter and main, it cannot be a main and dessert, which means to have dessert on this set menu you have no choice but to have the 3-course option for \u00a322.50 which seems quite silly. Since my friend and I were short of time as we had an event to attend after dinner, this rigid ordering system meant that we could only have the starter and main despite us wanting the dessert, which is a real shame for both us and the restaurant. Anyways, there's not much to highlight in terms of quality other than the portions being of decent size, reasonably tasty and the decor of the restaurant being nicely charismatic like a throw-back to the hustle and bustle of Parisian style dining in the Moulin-Rouge era. In short the meal is dignified and pleasant enough but just short of extraordinary.",

My friend booked the reservation with Opentable's 50% off deal with the purchase of 2 courses (starter and main or main and dessert). Worked out to be an amazing deal.The house red was a Bordeaux blend that was on point. I opted for the wild mushroom penne with Parmesan cream sauce. A filling portion, not overly saucy and served with a healthy serving of arugula so you feel like you're getting some greens in.Had the sticky toffee pudding to finish. The caramel sauce was divine, the cake part was a tad dry and perhaps not the freshest it could have been. Neither of those things kept me from polishing off the entire thing however, so I wouldn't be swayed away from this dessert choice.",

Looking on Tastecard for somewhere to have a quick but yummy dinner I stumbled across Boulevard Brasserie. It's close to Covent Garden and the Royal Opera house, so by nature in the footfall of tourists aka an assumed tourist trap and not somewhere I'd usually choose to eat in if I hadn't heard something about it first. What a mistake that is.This gorgeous little French restaurant was a glaringly obvious perfect find.We tucked in to delicious starters of chicken liver parfait with red onion chutney, and king prawn gratin. Both delicious. We washed it down with bellini's which were the only disappointed of the night (I've had far better!). For our mains we had beef bourgeon and douphinois \u00a0potatoes, and seafood linguine. Both were great sized portions and absolutely divine! We both commented that it was better than any food we'd eaten in Paris! We washed our mains down with fabulous wines, paid promptly and then ran out the door to the ballet we were minutes away from missing as we'd been enjoying our time in the restaurant too much! Everything from the friendly staff, the \"no no no, you mustn't get the risotto you must get the linguine\" (obviously said in a lovely French accent), the dim candlelight, the decor and ambience, to the mouth wateringly tasty dishes and bold wines was perfect!I highly recommend. And to top it off, 50% off with Tastecard. Boulevard Brasserie makes you feel like you're winning in life.",

Onion soup-- onions needs more carmelization. \u00a0Broth was lifeless. \u00a0Cheese on top and crouton weed good thank goodness. \u00a0But if you want great onion soup, do not order it here. \u00a0Mushroom risotto on waitress recommendation was dull and lifeless. \u00a0Moules FRites was simple and fine but not special. \u00a0Spinach salad simple and fine also. \u00a0Prices good but this was like checking the box on eating something. \u00a0Service was delightful. Marina was very sweet. \u00a0Skip Boulevard and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "BEST PUMPKIN SOUP EVER. I don't know if it's just seasonal but I crave it to this day. Also their beef bourguignon is incredible, though a bit small in size. We had a huge Christmas party in their downstairs area, which we rented along with the bar, for about ~35 or 40 people. They were very attentive, the display was beautiful and the staff incredibly friendly. The drinks were also good, though not included and a bit expensive. The food we had was delicious (this is when they gave us the pumpkin soup) and I really enjoyed my time there. This place might be 5 stars but I'd have to go back again. I think if the portions were slightly larger for the price it would be 5 already.",

    "text": "My mom and I were looking for a relatively low key (read: not London expensive) restaurant to have dinner and found Boulevard Brasserie through Trip Advisor. It's easy to find, has a warm, cozy interior and was the perfect ticket. We tried the baked brie and the beef bourguignon, which came in its own little Staub cast iron dutch oven. I would go back and it was nice to have something other than British food for a change!",

In fact, this was better French food than the majority of food we ate in Paris!We were having a late-ish lunch, and people started arriving for high tea, which looked simply amazing. \u00a0Will definitely be going back when we are next in London.",

    "text": "When you meet up with a friend for a pre-theatre dinner, you're looking for a few things - quick but friendly service, a decent pre-theatre menu and a good deal for 2 or 3 courses. Boulevard Brasserie had all of these... Well the service was a touch slow. But once seated we enjoyed a kir royal and 2 courses for \u00a318. Can't moan at that!I had some lovely pate to start and beef bourgignon for main. The pate was forgettable but the beef was tender, warm and filling. A perfect main meal for that time of year.. August. Yes I though this weird too that they had this on the menu in August (ever heard of a lighter summer menu guys?!) but on this particular day when it was lashing down with rain and particularly freezing as you'd expect the choice suddenly seemed pretty inspired!Couple of issues - the tables were small and squeezed together so everything was perched perilously on the tables when the main meals arrived. You also ended up squeezing past every other diner to get to your table and knocking over a few bits of cutlery in the process. But lovely food, well priced, great company and really close to the theatre, that's all I needed!",
