The prawn omelette with sambal paste is one of the most delicious brunch items I've had. Definitely recommended! The reason I don't give five stars is because the coffee was not as good as workshop. But all in all, one fantastic brunch place!",

Food-wise, I loved their homemade earl grey iced tea which i sipped on while waiting for everyone to arrive. The brunch itself was also top notch - i actually went for a main (the gnocchi) and loved it! A creative take on a classic, which looks like it's their philosophy with the whole menu. My friends had brunch dishes which also looked delicious. Finally, the espresso was perfect!",

    "text": "Overall, I had a lovely experience at Modern Pantry. We started out with oysters which were just okay. I prefer the small sweet ones. But these were a bit too large and tasted like a mouthful of salt water. So not a great start. However the paired champagne was to my liking. The mains were really tasty. I had the mackerel which was coated with walnuts, sat in a sweet puree and was accompanied by roasted veg. It hit the spot completely. It was filling but not too heavy and I would even venture to say that it tasted pretty healthy. The guys I went with had steak and lamb, both cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. The service was technically good, but at times felt a little cold and detached. When we asked questions about the menu, there wasn't any passion behind the answers, but maybe they were just shy. The space is inviting with its soft greys, whites and lighting. While there is nothing modern about the d\u00e9cor or the food, I supposed it's a modern take on what we would consider a pantry.",

    "text": "The Modern Pantry is an odd kind of restaurant. The interior is straight out of a magazine - to the extent of being pretty clich\u00e9d. The waiters are a parody of how waiters should be, including the stuck up French ma\u00eetre d who treats his diners with a remarkable amount of contempt.It really is the food that makes or breaks this place, and you can never tell what it will be. On previous occasions I've been and had wonderful scallop sashimi amongst other dishes and it's been memorable for good reasons. Last time I went and didn't enjoy a single dish. The starter of scallops with mango just didn't work. The main of Roast Barbary duck with beetroot and lentil would have been fine had it not been served with a near ice-cold lime aioli. Finally the sloe gin jelly with peanut biscuit was just far too bitter and alcohol flavoured for me to enjoy.At about \u00a340 a head for 3 courses without wine it's quite an expensive gamble to make. Unfortunately there's just something that excites me about this place that stops it being a never again venue.",

The lamb was very tender and the roast vegetable were really delicious. Dessert was a bit on the heavy side for me, quite a large portion to have after the main. It can be a bit on the pricey side and normally gets really full but they have some upstairs seating so it's not too hard to grab a table.",

Lots of modern twists on classic dishes and some things I'd never even heard of. I opted for a prawn omelette to start which was an odd choice but really delicious. My client had some sort of raw fish salad which looked great. My main was lamb rump and it didn't disappoint. It was as good as any Michelin starred restaurant in London. Lots of flavour. We finished the meal with a delightful Cognac. The atmosphere is buzzy, a great place for lunch or dinner. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I have one word for the manager of The Modern Pantry: acoustics. \u00a0The fact that my husband and I debated whether our ears could take any more of the shrill laughter bouncing off the walls from the table behind us when discussing dessert should tell you something. \u00a0It was painful...and the noise level was the thing I remember most about my meal at The Modern Pantry. To take things back to the beginning, we chose to take a walk to the Pantry for something a little different. \u00a0Plus, it has the bonus of being next to The Dovetail, so you can treat yourself to a delicious Belgian beer before dinner. \u00a0When we walked in, I thought, \"hmm...a little posher that I expected for a Friday nosh\" but that's what happens when you let your sig other make the booking. \u00a0We were shown upstairs, which felt a little empty, but was full by the time we left. \u00a0Our waiter, who reminded me of a young Simon Amstell, helped us choose a wine and we settled into our seats to study the menu. \u00a0My husband started with the scallop sashimi. \u00a0His thought was that the taste of the scallop was completely drowned by whatever was on top of it. \u00a0If you scraped all that off, it was delicious. \u00a0I don't understand why so many chefs want to go overboard when preparing delicate fish. \u00a0It's not the time to go nuts. \u00a0Embrace simplicity. \u00a0I chose to begin the meal with squid, which was wonderful. \u00a0All too often, I'm left lusting over what other people at the table order, but this time I was the winner. \u00a0Ray wing was presented to my husband as his main. \u00a0It was meaty and tender. \u00a0I believe the word \"yumskers\" was used. \u00a0I ordered the beef fillet with cassava chips. \u00a0I try to steer clear of beef in restaurants because I prefer a very thick cut. \u00a0I can eliminate disappointment form my life if I choose the cut I want from the butcher's shop and cook it myself. \u00a0This night, however, the red wine coaxed me into going for the beef anyway. \u00a0Thanks, wine! \u00a0It was an acceptable thickness, perfectly cooked, and the accompanying chips were excellent. \u00a0Thick, but still with a crispiness. \u00a0It was hard not to eat them all, but I wanted to save room for pudding. \u00a0It was about halfway through the mains that the night went downhill - fast. \u00a0A group of about 8 women came in and were seated in a little nook, which amplified the ear piercing laughs and husky voices. \u00a0If there was a particularly lour crescendo, heads at all other tables would snap around and give pleading looks to the table. \u00a0\"Please, please be a bit quieter\" was what we were all thinking. \u00a0I know if sounds silly to say a table of 8 ruined my night, but it kind of did. \u00a0It's hard to walk away from a meal that wasn't cheap and think, \"well that wasn't fun.\" \u00a0I did have pudding that night and I can't even remember what it was.",

As it is we drove across town in order to be close to Kings Cross to see off a friend later on in the day.The Sunday breakfast/brunch is the best I have had in a long time. The choice is varied and different from the usual.Loved a cooked vegetarian breakfast with haloumi cheese and spinach and could quite happily have eaten everyone else's choices, too. Couldn't resist the temptation of following this with one of the muffins which were lovingly displayed in the middle of the table.Not sure if the company of Australians made me imagine this place to be by the beach. But the decor is lovely, fresh and bright.Even though our water was most definitely severely hungover (or still drunk from the night before), we experienced brilliant and very friendly service.Will definitely try and find an excuse to go again.",

I really liked the flavors of the sauce and the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. My only complaint was the salad on the plate ended up getting completely drenched in the steak sauce because there was so much of it. It would have been nice if the salad could have been served on a separate plate, because the original dressing on the greens was quite lovely at the beginning of the meal. I also got a pear dessert with meringue that was really light and the perfect end to the meal. Overall, a really great cute restaurant. If I lived closer, I'm sure I would return.",

High-quality ingredients and plenty of veg.My group went here for a Sunday lunch, and tried dishes ranging from the brunch variety to the lunch/dinner variety.The standout dishes were the steak with miso sauce with yucca fries, the pancakes (a big hit with the gluten-eaters), the haloumi cheese, and the inventive desserts. The chef recently wrote a cookbook, and the restaurant's menu seems to be largely based on it (or vice versa). If I weren't so busy eating in restaurants, I would have bought it. It's pretty cool to say, \"Wow, that steak was so amazing,\" and then be able to walk out with the recipe that would let you make it yourself at home. Gluten-free notes: They are aware of gluten and happy to advise - even aware of the lesser-known gluten sources such as soy sauce. Many of the dishes are naturally gluten-free -- even desserts. You will eat deliciously.",

It was around 11:30 and the place was empty except of one table I was offered the place next to the glassy entrance door and when I asked if I can get some where less sunny I was told that all tables a BOOKED ! I was so ashamed that I came in without even trying to book a table Anyway, the menu offered strange food ingredients - similar to The Providores as they were actually under the same umbrella for a while until partners split up- And for myself to sample as much as possible I ordered three dishes (which I can not remember as I did not enjoy any) Not even the coffee was any special I stayed there till 1 pm and the Modern Pantry with its all booked tables stayed emptyPeople started gradually filling up but the point is why make a single customer feel rejected and offer the very inconvenient table if you can make the experience much enjoyable My review is not influenced by the way I was welcomed into the Modern Pantry as I asked coupe of friends about the food and the verdicts were not any better than my own.",

Still, if you're looking for somewhere in the area then it's a perfectly decent choice and it seems to do good business as it's always bustling.It has a full range of what you would ordinarily expect for brunch (basic components of an English breakfast arranged in a variety of combinations), plus a few slightly less traditional ingredients thrown in here and there to mix it up - chorizo, plantain, tamarillo, haloumi.... So there's something to interest those who like their brunch a bit more experimental. It also has a broad selection of loose leaf teas as well as the standard coffees. When it really comes into its own is on a sunny day - if you can snag one of the tables outside in the courtyard it's a complete sun trap, so it's a lovely spot to bask and make the most of an opportunity to enjoy a moment of British summer.",

Does this food all come from the same chef/kitchen?The dinner menu offers colourful and creative options that are are quite novel in my mind. Flaky white fish over a kimchi base held some eye-opening heat whilst an elegantly plated lightly creamy crab salad cooled our palates.For the dairy fiends amongst you, be sure to partake of the cheese plate. I found it quite affordable and nominally pricier than the sweet dessert dishes at under \u00a310. If memory serves, ours featured a gorgeous (yet mild) Stilton, a mouthwatering Pecorino, and a soft Brie-like wedge that all but melted across the plate.If you're considering dining at The Modern Pantry, I'd strongly encourage you to make a booking for dinner. I've never actually seen the place fully occupied, but each visit I've made, they always inquire whether or not we have a reservation, so I imagine they must get rammed at times.",

The starters are exquisitely prepared with a balanced fusion of flavours, and everyone in the table was delighted by them - i must highlight the house specialty which is a prawn omelet - as vulgar as it sounds it's no ordinary omelet. The main courses were spectacular and very well cooked. I had the cod which was very fresh and cooked to the point, accompanied by an aromatic curry sauced sweet potato, and a mix of strong flavoured veggies. The desert was a variation of panacotta with red berries, and again, there was nothing vulgar about it. The selection of ice creams was vast and very good. The cheese was the only not so good part of the meal, but it was quickly forgotten with the ports and whiskey selection. The 10 year tawny is a must and for me jack with one ice! Great place to explore fusion australian/kiwi cuisine and the apart from a few minor incidents the staff was lovely! The price is as high as you want it to be, but not overpriced for the quality you get!",

    "text": "We have come here a couple of times for brunch. Once upstairs in a reasonably formal restaurant setting and more recently outside on a warm spring day in the relaxed south facing courtyard at the front of the restaurant. Unsurprisingly, the later was a more successful setting, although it felt slightly odd that the stiff cotton napkins had migrated outside with us. Thankfully, the tablecloths stayed indoors.The brunch menu has a fusion vibe which now seems to be almost ubiquitous amongst London brunch venues with Providores, Caravan and the nearby St Ali all hitting the same notes. The highlight for me were ricotta pancakes served with poached rhubarb and crime fraiche. The pancakes were gloriously soft with the rhubarb providing just enough acidity to keep the dish in balance. Less successful was Modern Pantry's take on eggs Benedict which featured streaky bacon instead of ham and yuzu hollandaise. It was not clear what either change brought to the dish. However, these tweaks were not the main problem which stemmed from the dish having been served luke warm. \u00a0Still the coffee was good (using beans roasted a Caravan) whether Latte, Flat White or Macchiato in form and the service was excellent.Overall, the restaurant inside felt too stuffy for brunch I would not return to eat there but being outside everything felt much better and I will return on a sunny day sometime soon.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited The Modern Pantry during our trip to London, in hopes of finding a good combination between his desire for a proper Sunday lunch and my preference for a lighter meal. Our visit was a comedy of errors. I ordered the mint/blackcurrent fritters and yogurt with granola, etc. My husband had the two-course Sunday lunch. My fritters were brought along with his first course and were simply inedible -- black, bitter, and unpleasant, like a hush puppy gone very wrong. Meanwhile, I could see that my yogurt had been brought to the pass directly after the order was placed (though I requested to have it brought with my husband's second course) and was simply sitting there -- for the 20+ minutes for which we waited for the first course. It presumably would have continued to sit until his roast was served (approximately 45 minutes after our order was placed), had I not requested to change my order, based on the poor quality of the fritters and the fact that the yogurt had been sitting out.The staff was quite accomodating about changing my order to an English muffin and fruit salad, though my view of the pass made it quite clear that both the kitchen and front-of-house staff were very confused generally, which is of concern giving that they were not busy during our visit. My food was bought almost immediately after I placed my second order; however, my husband continued to wait over 20 minutes for his second course. As a result, I ate my full meal while he sat and watched; he then ate his full meal while I sat and watched. None of the staff inquired into this situation or apologized for it. The fruit salad and English muffin were perfectly acceptable, as was the majority of my husband's roast (though his Yorkshire pudding was rock hard). However, it was hardly worth the cost and the inconvenience of deadling with the poor service. For a meal we were truly looking forward to, The Modern Patnry was a huge disappointment.It's also worth noting that The Modern Pantry is a bit out of the way/off the beaten path. This wouldn't be a problem if it were a lovely dining experience -- but it just wasn't.",

The menu is inventive, but not pretentious, so it will appeal to the adventurous and the not so much. However, dinner service was a bit slow and inept. Service is the one thing that this place needs to work on. With that said, the service for the mid-morning snack and coffee on the piazza outside was very good, friendly and prompt.

The atmosphere is very light country and homey. The china all eclectic and very cute. Having been to afternoon tea before I was left a bit disappointed. I found it a bit expensive for what you actually got. Finger sandwiches and desserts, but just less than what I was expecting for the price. The service was also not the best. For a tea, they didn't come around and actually ask anyone which teas they would like, or describe the selection or really anything until prompted. After we had finished we waited for about half hour before again asking ourselves for the bill. For being such a little restaurant I just don't know how you can miss a big table, or at least not check in once in a while. It was a cold day and the heaters were on, however as we were sat by the kitchen it was so hot we were actually all quite flushed and sweaty. I really wish I could have loved my experience but I just didn't. I think perhaps if I were to go again it would be with, less people, regular menu, and a seat away from the kitchen.",

    "text": "Oh dear. Words cannot describe the marvelous experience I had for brunch at The Modern Pantry (but I shall try to do it justice).Upon entering, we could see that The Modern Pantry was bustling with local Saturday brunchers. We thankfully had a reservation (highly recommended for the weekend) and were promptly seated by the window upstairs (lovely view). The interior is so simple and well-designed. The minimalism was far from alienating though as the atmosphere was warm and welcoming (even to us non-British guests). Our server was delightfully helpful to us in terms of choosing items she recommended.The raspberry and ricotta pancakes were fluffy, rich and very sweet. It was a good amount of sweet for us, but some may find the amount of raspberries overwhelming. For our next item, we were intrigued to try their scrambled eggs. As vegetarians, we could not order the menu items with meat, but our server was more than happy to accommodate our unique request for eggs and their toast. Let me just say that the eggs were the most heavenly scrambled eggs I have eaten in my life. We were very seriously considering ordering another round but were pleasantly surprised by their AMAZING toast. Yes, it may sound silly that their toast is good but I'm not joking -- it is actually so well done. The bread is fresh and well-toasted with just the right amount of butter. You'll understand my sentiment when you have also eaten this toast. I can't wait to hop over the pond back to London so I can come here again!",

The waiting time we were told was 30 minutes (in reality it was 40), which wasn't too bad, given they were fully booked when we checked during the week.We got a table outside - on a sunny day that's what you want to do. If you're not too hungry.... We waited for our food (which isn't very complicated...poached eggs, toast, salmon/bacon....) for at least ONE HOUR. The service was appalling. Though they kept apologising...they kept forgetting our food! I'm not sure if it's because we were seated in the corner outside or lack of staff....majority of people around us was waiting on their food too.Funnily enough, both of us found the main menu too complicated so we opted for standard brunch food.Now, the food was very good. I had poached eggs on wholemeal toast with chorizo and side of salmon and my friend had eggs on toast with bacon and halloumi side. Both were really good. Shame about the wait, it's good neither of us was really annoyed by this - given it was a lazy Sunday. However if you are in a rush, I would suggest either going some place else or try sitting inside (maybe service is better there).",

It wasn't by choice, more by default. They assumed based on the 4 women's choices and I went with it. When the food arrived on the three tiered rack, I was doubtful of its filling qualities. I quickly counted the items, mentally divided it among the table's occupants, looked around for waitstaff and gave up. Two small sandwiches, two scones (one sweet, one savory), some chocolate and a mini-cupcake for each person. \u00a0It was certainly colorful enough and looked good on my camera.Sandwiches consisted of vegetable and tea smoked salmon. Scones were spinach (zucchini maybe?) with butter and jelly and pumpkin (or other squash?) with cream cheese. The tea smoked salmon and pumpkin scone were definitely my winners. Like Jin, I also wish they had explained what we were about to eat. As I was savoring these treats, I also enjoyed a Gen Mai Cha.Overall, the service brings the rating down.",

We actually were planning on settling for a burger and some Belgian beers at the Dovetail around the corner, but apparently that place is closed on Sundays. But we were not disappointed and actually delighted we arrived at The Modern Pantry. After a 20 minute wait we got our table on the second floor. The restaurant is hosted in an old house they completely refurnished in a more modern style. Think this place is equally good for either a date, a family lunch or catching up with friends. I had the lunch option of 2 poached eggs with toast and grilled merguez sausages. This was really good. The sausage was spicy, eggs were perfectly done and the additional tomatoes, fritters and toast made this dish big enough to go for lunch. I had a Vienna lager to go with it, recommended to me by the waiter. In total, the bill was about \u00a315 each which was a very good price for the value we got in return.",

    "text": "I think if you're prepared to throw down a fair bit of cash on a very good (bit not mind-blowing) meal, then you're all set.Went to Modern Pantry for a date, and while the environment was lovely, I was pretty underwhelmed. The service was okay, but not to the standard I would expect for somewhere this nice. We waited for a good 15 minutes before having to flag down someone else's waiter for our bill - and that's how the service was our entire evening.Food-wise, we had a seasonal special, a game bird (grouse or pheasant maybe) with an interesting mix of seasonings (vanilla and Za'atar featured), with a lovely salad. It was very good, decent portions, and cooked perfectly. Our desserts were also nice - we shared a peach melba and a chocolate fondant. They were good, but not amazing. I felt they were a bit simple and not done well enough to be exciting.What threw me at the end was the price we paid for a bottle of wine. There wasn't a wine list on our table, and the menu suggested pairings but only listed prices by glass. So I was a bit taken aback to find that the bottle of Malbec we ordered set us back \u00a335. It was a decent Malbec, but it was NOT \u00a335 good. Had we known the cost of the bottle, it never would have touched the table. It felt really deceptive to us.All in all, we won't be returning. The food was good, but it wasn't \u00a3100 for dinner for two good. We were also really unimpressed with the lack of service and the bit of menu sneakiness around pricing. I don't mind paying for quality, I just don't feel that we got the quality to justify what we paid. There are so many great dining options in London, and they miss too many tricks for me.",

The sandwiches (smoked salmon, avocado & yuzu mayonnaise sandwichSlow roast tomato, marinated feta, rocket & \u00a0green pepper relish sandwich) were very different from the usual cucumber fare you get at other tea places. The scones were a bit of a joke. They were the size of a 50P coin and one already came with a scant bit of cream and jam. Don't take away my pleasure of slathering on the clotted cream myself! The nerve. The other scone was a savory Parmesan tarragon one. When I compare this tea experience \u00a0to Bea's of Bloomsbury's afternoon tea, this place doesn't hold a candle to it. There's no bang for your quid. Go for the atmosphere. Or maybe try the restaurant. Maybe it's more generous with its portions.",

The afternoon tea follows the same format as most, with the sandwiches and pastries having a twist (green tea scones and savory red pepper scones, for instance). The quality of the food was excellent as was the tea. I found myself absolutely loving every item. What took this restaurant above and beyond was when the server overheard that my friend was gluten-free and the kitchen completely customized the menu for her, making gluten-free versions of every dish I had. She commented that the food was excellent. I can't wait to come back here and try brunch and dinner.Two thumbs up.",

The salmon was really tasty; I could definitely taste the tea, and it went well with my latte as well. The space is sleek and modern, and you can see the chefs working behind the counter in the kitchen. There are plenty of enticing-looking beverage options on the menu as well. The pastries, grains, and smoothies all look delicious as well. I also adore the decor of the place; it's very clean-feel, neat, and reminiscent of a farm-to-table dining venue, all complete with a chef's tasting menu (which I do not think they actually provide). If the weather's nice you can also opt to sit outside and soak up the nice quietude in the courtyard away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The innovative and exquisitely prepared foods along with the ambiance definitely make Modern Pantry a good spot to take your out-of-town friends or even a date. I couldn't give a 5-star review though because the server seemed less than enthusiastic, which is an attitude that's always needed to make a fine dining experience whole.",

Set in a building with large windows letting in the full sunlight, it was one of the most beautiful indoor brunch experiences I had. They have multiple floors, and I noticed larger, posher rooms for big groups as well. My friends suggested that this ambience is quite representative of Australia which is likely given that the owners are from NZ. Finally, service was great. Prompt and kind.

They oddly had candles burning during the day when it was really bright but anyways the overall ambiance was nice.

First, service was really slow, I don't know if it was just for us as some other tables had time to come in and out while we were still waiting and waiting for our main dish, but we waiting a long long time to have the starter, and then the main. The food was good but nothing exceptional, I was ok with mine, but some other were not that impressed with their main (shrimp omelette)...still I can't say it wasn't good at all, but just missing something...and finally the coffee was not good, I usually have a flat white or latte which usually can hide the taste of bad coffee but it really didn't do the trick there.It's a shame because I really like the decor and atmosphere of the Modern Pantry, it's bright and light, really pleasant, and the outdoor seating is nice for sunny days, but the place is not on the cheap range and I was expecting more...maybe that's the \"price to pay\" for places which have become really popular. I might give them another try, but this wouldn't be my go to place in Clerkenwell as there are other nice places not far from here.",

    "text": "Beautiful place, nice food but I felt that what I ordered was good but didn't showcase the meats. Let me explain. As a starter I ordered the pork cheeks which I absolutely ADORE and cook at home sometimes. It came breaded (weird) and with a vinegared slaw on the side that absolutely overpowered the meat, almost covered up the taste of it as if it was the lame little brother at a party. So that was a bit disappointing and a shame. The next course I had was the lamb rump, with a mandarin cream that was really surprising and lovely with lotus root crisps. Really nice balance and very tasty. To end I had the warm Olive oil & orange cake with poached clementine, saffron cream and candied walnuts. the cake. DRYYYY. DRY DRY DRY DRY DRY. jesus. Its supposed to be an OLIVE OIL cake. Also, tasteless. It could've been a door stop, that would've given it more purpose than to be consumed. Saffron? what saffron? I tasted no saffron. The candied walnuts were nice. So in conclusion 1/3 gets you 3 stars. I did try the jasmine ice cream which was delicious and would go really well with champagne as a summer time take on a root beer float. champagne jasmine float instead. yum.",

We also enjoyed the goats curd scone. Other things were also very good, except the marshmallow thing which was a bit funky. We would highly recommend this afternoon tea for a couple reasons: 1. It is splittable(no one really ever needs a full afternoon tea) 2. It is cozy and not stuffy 3. It is a slightly different than normal tea at a hotel- really tasty and non traditional bites3. It is less than half of the price of tea at some of the west end establishments. Overall looking forward to returning for a spring or summer version.",

You have to book in advance and this place was heaving on the Sunday brunch I went for.But while it might have pioneered a more refined and upmarket style of casual brunch, it now sadly isn't a leader anymore in London. The food was so-so, the pricing a bit on the steep side, and because of its popularity, the staff try to shoo you off your table quickly. We were politely reminded only after an hour and 15 minutes that there was someone else waiting for the table!!Brunches are meant to be enjoyed, not rushed.A place with better brunch food and coffee is Workshop Coffee just down the road.I can't see myself going back to Modern Pantry anytime soon.",

For 20 pounds, I got a raspberry lychee bellini, an earl grey tea, and a scone/sandwich/cake combination. The cocktail was delicious. I wish I knew exactly what my food was, and I overheard the server explaining to someone else exactly what each component was, and unfortunately I didn't receive that same treatment. From what I deduced, however, there was some kind of cheese sandwich, a salmon sandwich, a foccacia-esque scone, another scone with some chutney, a cube of brownie and a lemon muffin with icing. The food was all quite tasty. The servingware was all very quaint and pretty, and that definitely enhanced my experience.The restaurant itself has multiple floors, and it seems like there are more banquet-esque rooms on the upstairs if you wanted it.",

There's no question this place voted Remain. Moreover, it's located in an attractive building that I walk past regularly, and boasts a more interesting brunch menu than average. All in all, I was excited for my visit here last Sunday. Sadly, I left a little disappointed. I ordered what would usually be called Eggs Benedict, which was let down by its yuzu hollandaise. All the other members of the cast put in strong performances: the English muffins and bacon were both excellent; the poached eggs were perfectly cooked, the hazelnut dukkah a pleasant surprise. But this was rendered moot by the acidic onslaught of the hollandaise. I'm not sure if the error here was in execution or composition, but it brought discord to the dish where there should have been harmony. A crying shame. I'd have been more sympathetic had it not been for the decidedly sluggish service throughout our meal. At \u00a317.40 a head for a brunch dish and a coffee each plus a shared round of toast, it was also at the upper end of reasonable. Maybe the 52% had a point after all.",

We were supposed to have diner in the other location, but because of a privatisation of the restaurant they changed our diner location, for that they offered us a glass of champagne, such a nice gesture !Although the dishes are really original and so easy for vegetarian, love that ;) recommend 100% !",

After a fire alarm had emptied nearby Workshop Coffee out onto the street, my brunch date and I decided to chance it here hoping most people had left the city on a sunny Good Friday. We were in luck and they had a table free, and my guy let me sit by the window so I could happily bask in the sunshine. I liked the unexpected ingredient combinations on the menu - you won't find your standard brunch run down here. I went for the prawn omelette with green chilli and spring onion, having never had prawns in an omelette before, and I have to say it was heavenly mostly thanks to the generous dollop of amazing smoked chilli sambal paste on top. I also got a avocado on the side which they'd seasoned nicely with lemon, and stealing a bit of my guy's halloumi side meant I had all the flavours I could want in a brunch!I also got a mixed berry smoothie which was delish but I was a little disappointed with the small size for \u00a35. That's my only niggle with the place - the popularity's gone to its head and everything's just a few quid more expensive than it should be. We were well looked after by the servers - though I probably wouldn't have noticed otherwise in my vitamin D induced haze. A nice touch was also the pretty card the bill arrived in which I took away with me to write to someone later! A blissful and very Good Friday all round :)",

    "text": "Oh, well this is awkward.I told myself, time and again, that I'd try out The Modern Pantry. But then I dismissed it: seemed expensive, seemed busy, no room on the patio, didn't make a booking. Always a reason.I HAVE BEEN AN IDIOT.My vegetarian pal was visiting, and she had bookmarked TMP (acronyms for efficiency) as a place heavy on veggie-forward dishes. We didn't make a booking, but strolled in for a (very) late Friday lunch. The patio was filled, but the light, airy, beautiful indoor space was only partially full. Veggie explorations included:- watermelon gazpacho; nicely peppery, with some refreshing pea shoots atop- smoked burrata; my least favourite of the options, with some over-the-top tangily, vinegared plums and onions- miso and sesame-studded aubergine, with a mix of mushrooms- (the true gem was) coconut laksa; it was phenomenal, served with lemony roasted cauliflower and sweet butternut squash-studded rice parcels, lightly tempura-fried. A beautiful plate, and even better tasting- affogado? Don't mind if I (affoga)DO! Go for the cinder toffee option, it's delicious. It's not the most affordable of lunches, but the plates were generous: the 'small plates' were definitely larger than the tapas-sized 'bites' that I had anticipated. Special call-out to the cocktails. The cocktail of the week was a tangy, slightly bitter, pink grapefruit, prosecco and rosemary delight. YES TO THIS. Yelp note: afternoon tea looks *delightful* and is comparatively really affordable (boozy and non-boozy options available). Shout-out to the adorable party of 6 women celebrating a birthday next to us!",

Food and service was mixed to disappointing.We were here about an hour early due to mix up with the booking, however luckily they were able to accommodate us. We were seated and menus passed around. This is one of those places that tries to fancily list every ingredient to a dish in ways that mean you have no idea what is actually in the actual dish. For instance listing the type of fish or cheese, but conveniently leaving out those words itself.Food wise, I didn't really enjoy the starter, enjoyed the main course and loved the wobbly lime jelly dessert. Service was a mixed bag. The staggering between courses was fine. However when it came to order drinks it was a struggle. After the initial drinks order, the server didn't come by once to ask if we were okay for drinks. Normally I don't mind this no pressure relaxed attitude to not pressuring you for drinks. But as we were here on a work lunch (read: free!) it would have been nice to not work to order every single drink. To be honest I expected the staff to be more personable or friendly. But they were a little stand-offish/in-experienced in practice. The visit was pleasant, but personally I can't find a reason to come back, apart from the lovely dessert, and the really nice outside courtyard area that would be pretty awesome in the summer.",

OMG! Tender, fall apart, pillow soft hake with a large square, (looks like a piece of lasagna!), of baked cabbage. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0Also started with the carrot with creme soup, also delicious!Two fabulous, fruit spiked iced teas, a glass of Italian wine, olive cup starter and then: \u00a0toffee affogoto and a citron cheesecake with candied kumquats? (The grow the kumquat tree out front, so come on! That's five stars). \u00a0Desserts were, again, stellar!112 pounds for all,of that. \u00a0Worth it!To be fair, I agree that service is a bit sad for such a wonderful food experience. \u00a0The man up front was wonderful, but waitress indifferent. Never asked after us and we were wanting more wine half way through. \u00a0Had to flag her down for a check. (This is a small place.... Where is she disappearing to and how does she walk right by an empty wine glass??). So one less star but you should risk it to try the food. \u00a0Maybe she's not working your day!We found this by accident, having just checked into a nearby hotel and it being our 19th anniversary, decided on a special lunch. \u00a0I wouldn't \u00a0have done it differently!",

The main problem in my opinion is they try too hard: too much flavours combination, too much ingredients, dishes name too long. Most of the time I wasn't sure what I was eating. The mozzarella starter was a fritter of mozza, butternut, spinach,pea and at least 2 other ingredients I couldn't identify. All the dishes came with a lot of very peppery salad (which I loved) but the taste was so strong it overpowered everything else.The 4 fries served with the beef were floury and dry. Not interesting.Cocktails want to be unique but they just are not that good (bloody mary was not nice - everyone at my table tried and we all agreed it was not a success)Service was ok but we came in late (21:30) and at 22:30 they started to hoover in the kitchen which was right behind. We felt like we had to hurry up. After the starter and main I was quite put off by the desert so I decided to get the simplest thing on the menu: cross bun ice cream sandwich which was good.",

It was about 12pm and fully booked inside! Luckily the weather was lovely and the queue wasn't too long for a seat outside. We waited about 20 minutes and were seated. The building itself is lovely from the outside with a cute area of tables and chairs surrounded by plants with a view over the square. The inside also looked nice with big windows, spacious seating and snazzy toilets! They also have a private dinning area that I peaked at which looked lovely. On to the food! I had the espresso martini which was nice and bf had a coffee which was also tasty. Bf got a croissant to start (we were starving) and I got some toast and home made jams. Rose and cherry and the apricot jam were awesome! Next we both ordered a large main - I went blueberry waffles with yoghurt honey and nuts (YUM) and bf got chorizo eggs etc.It was delicious, a little pricey but I can't wait to go back for dinner!",

The restaurant itself is lovely, very bright and clean, with a friendly welcome from the staff. We did sit around for what felt like a bit too long before anyone approached to take our drink order, but the waitress was friendly and helpful when she did arrive. Menu has some very intriguing dishes, twists on classic brunch favourites, like a veal mince omelette, and poached eggs with tea smoked salmon and hollandaise. I opted for the waffle of sweet corn, spinach, feta and medjool dates with bacon. My portion felt a bit small for the price (around \u00a313) and I wasn't wowed with the flavours overall. Also, my plate was cold so the food cooled quite rapidly. \u00a0My friend had one of the egg dishes, and her side of halloumi was very unappealing, having been deep fried within an inch of its life and served up greasy and unseasoned. I ordered a soya cappuccino- sadly the first was delivered in a cup with a very clear lipstick mark in it! I asked for a replacement, and was brought a fresh one, but I always find dirty crockery a bit worrying, especially with how obvious it was!Very limited engagement from the staff, and we had to ask a few times for the bill. Overall, the experience was pleasant, but don't feel the service or the food really warranted the high prices.",

The bread was great and had three different types which were all cooked perfectly. \u00a0We then had a form of croquette with an addictive dipping sauce - excellent.For mains/ starters we had sea bass/ prawn omelette and a lamb couscous mix. \u00a0Each of them was very well done and a touch more interesting due to asian/ australian inspired background. We had a panna cotta (good but overcomplicated) and a rhubarb/ peacn tart (great and comforting).Please go - great.",

That aside, the rest of us (three very happy campers) thoroughly enjoyed the quality of the food, the variety of choices available for brunch, the service and the decor. Just looooove the art in the upstairs dining area, and the light fittings too. Cannot wait to go back and have a leisurely brunch again - think I'll get the sugar cured prawn omelette this time and then once that's settled try a muffin for finishers. Yum, yum. Tip: Do book as they get rather busy on the weekends for brunch and if downstairs is looking a little harried ask to be seated upstairs.",

Interesting stuff.I had a scotched quail's egg, the surrounding meat being chorizo based. Very nicely done with a tomato salsa accompaniment. The Sashimi was the best one of my lunch partners had eaten. We tried some chips I had never heard of (with salt I had never heard of!) and they were good too, with an accompaniment of creme fraiche and tomato. All good.I got two big scotch eggs, probably a little too much for all that chorizo. It got a little heavy, but that's my fault for being greedy and eating it all.My main course was a delight. Poached baby chicken with a coconut sauce and sweet potato. Poached poussin isn't something you see on most menus and it was as delicate and light as I had hoped. The sauce really set off the light meat. Lovely stuff. two of our party had the veal escalope which looked great.No room for pudding.Surroundings a little stark. Wooden floors and walls and grey paint. Service to match. Maitre d' was a little abrupt. But I don't want to be his mate. I just want expertly cooked food that is refreshingly different and that's what I got. Fair prices too and a cracking area full of history to wander round after.A very decent experience.",

Stupidly enough, I didn't actually order them because I was feeling guilty after munching through not one, but two full English breakfast in the previous two days. I took a fruit salad. It did happen to be delicious and all the fruit was perfectly ripened, but maybe a touch over the top at 6 pounds something. Expect breakfast for two to come in at around 25 quid. The decor is bright and airy, and reminds me of The Garrison somewhat, a favourite of mine. I think I'll come back, order the pancakes, and be very happy.",

    "text": "Being a South Londoner it was a trek to the Modern Pantry, but I really wanted to try out their brunch menu. Brunch is a much over-looked menu style in London and I am constantly looking for somewhere that serves interesting sweet and savoury food mid-morning and into the afternoon. Looking at the menu of the Modern Pantry I was excited. After failing to get a booking online I phoned and was immediately offered a table. What's the point of online booking if it doesn't work. Arrived 11AM on Saturday to a buzzing restaurant, with the outside seats taken by folks in their sunglasses and a collection of hairy dogs. Inside, the decor is very attractive and airy, feels very contemporary. Food was excellent. I had a prawn omlette which was stunning. It had just the right balance of curry for a brunch meal, and the serving size was spot on, not too much and not too little. The other two at my table had the waffles which sounded delicious, and granola which I didn't see the point in but the hangover dictated it apparently. However, I have to agree with the other reviews that the service really needs work on. We ordered a juice, and not until we asked the third time did it arrive. We had food of other orderers land on our table with real confusion when we said it wasn't ours. Coffees were good taste-wise, but arrived cold. This shouldn't put you off trying, but a word to the Modern Pantry - get your service sharper! In London I suppose it will do well regardless of the service as there is a dearth of good eateries like the Modern Pantry, but this could become a truly great place if it nailed the service",

    "text": "I wanted to take the other half out for a decent Sunday brunch, but couldn't find anywhere which was a) not extortionate b) not in West London and c) offering more than just a roast. The Modern Pantry came recommended via the interweb and it ticked all the boxes. The only problem I have with it is its location in the heart of Clerkenwell, an area which on a Sunday is more dead than a decomposing pigeon. However, given the very pretty building The Modern Pantry is housed in - a charming narrow homestead tucked away between the boring offices - I can understand why they're there. It was only after I'd booked that I realised the kiwi connection (I'm a New Zealander of old) - my first clue was the hokey pokey ice cream on the menu - but what I hadn't expected was to step into a light, fresh, Auckland-vibe cafe. I honestly spent the entire meal convinced I was on Ponsonby Road. The place was bustling so I was glad we'd booked, and we sat upstairs in a light, pretty dining room. The vibe was that of a glowing, sociable, Sunday-afternoon. I had fabulously perfect poached eggs with mouth-watering halloumi (done to perfection - not a squeak was heard) and grilled toms, toast, and spinach. My other half had the tea-smoked salmon with eggs which may just be the best smoked salmon I've ever tasted. This was the proper, cooked fillet kind of smoked salmon with a perfectly smoky flavour, and not that slimy slivery kind of smoked salmon you normally get with breakfast. We were both in raptures over our brunch... at first it seemed the portions might not be enough, but we were more than stuffed by the time we downed cutlery. My only gripe would be that the salmon and poached eggs dish could do with more than one piece of toast. [Note, that's the worst I could come up with.] Drinks were the Earl Grey & Elderflower Iced Tea with fresh mint (divine - I could have drunk several litres of it) and fresh juices. Followed with a pot of Earl Grey tea. Normally I frown upon being served teabags rather than loose leaf, but they only charged \u00a32 a pot and the brand they used (Drury Lane) was absolutely gorgeous. Meals were brought out swiftly and the service was friendly and polite, but trying to flag down a waiter for anything else took bit longer because the place was so busy. As it was, they seemed to have a tight-knit but friendly service system in place. And frankly, I'd rather slow service than being rushed, especially on a Sunday, so I wasn't bothered at all. All up the meal came to \u00a330 incl service, for drinks, tea, and cooked breakfasts for two which, for the standard of the food and the pleasant atmosphere, was bloody good value. I will be going back there again.",

After a hectic, multi means of transport trip - courtesy to \u00a0'Transport for London' - we arrived at quiet and beautiful St John's Square. 2 Lychee Bellinis and the airy and open atmosphere of the restaurant made us settle in very comfortably ,very quickly. We went for steak and grilled sea bass which were both prepared and cooked to perfection. The staff are lovely and very attentive. Their recommendations on deserts were spot on. Szechuan Pepper mixed with meringue and fresh rasberry colis did not seem a natural fit, but our waiter was so convincing (lovely smile btw) that we overcame our traditional preconceptions on what works in deserts. Our reward: Instant happiness and delight. I could keep on raving - but as I truly believe in personal experiences all I will say is: Go there and try for yourselves, you will not regret it'. Oh, and yes, it is also a perfect place to bring your parents to. In fact, they will love you for bringing them there...",

    "text": "Brunch at The Modern Pantry started off well with a lovely waitress and a delicious looking menu. The Japanese Mary cocktails were light and tasty and we thought we were in for a nice chilled Sunday afternoon eating a yummy, lazy brunch in the bright and airy downstairs dining room.wrong! Yes the brunch we began was yummy (aside from the streaky bacon being disappointingly only just cooked so the fat was still fatty and no hint of crispness, oh and no seasoning on the eggs but that could be down to taste) but we made the apparently heinous mistake of saying that the fritters that we had ordered as side dish seemed a bit burnt. They did look very dark brown and on trying them tasted bitter and overdone on the outside. We thought it was a simple enough and polite comment but the waiter who we had called over looked at our plate in disbelief, said not one word in response to us and instead picked the plate up whilst rolling his eyes and shaking his head as he walked off. We were a bit taken aback at this but continued eating and shrugged it off. We had heard a few swears and moans from the kitchen earlier and there was a stressed vibe coming across the pass which is open to the dining room but the place wasn't jammed and regardless we really thought the fritters tasted burnt! The waiter came back out and we looked at him expectantly only to be completely blanked as he walked past our table. It took him another few minutes to come back to us and say \" So we are going to do your fritters again but they weren't burnt. Thats how they are done and if they do them any less they will be raw in the middle\" We were not sure at this point if we had accidentally insulted his dead mother without realising but the level of attitude was quite horrible. We said in that case we didn't want the fritters and he turned on his heels and walked off to the kitchen without out any further discussion or god forbid an apology. Were we meant to say yes ok give us raw fritters then or were we meant to apologise for having such terrible taste? We kept eating but were made to feel even more uncomfortable when I looked up only to see the waiter talking in the ear of another waiter and turning round and pointing at us. When they saw I had caught them doing this they went round the corner continuing to talk as they did. By this point we had gone off our brunch and decided that rather than getting upset any further by rudeness we would just ask for the bill and leave. Despite half my brunch being left on my plate it was cleared without comment or asking if the food had been ok. Even the greasy spoon up the road from me asks if everything was ok! A different waiter brought the credit card machine and only after running the card details through did he say I am sorry about the fritters. I said we did not have a problem with the fritters it was the staff member being rude, rolling his eyes at us and shaking his head in response that was upsetting. Oh I am sorry he said do you want me to take the service charge off? This was the final insult. No I don't want to take the service charge away from the perfectly pleasant waitress and you might as well be saying you really couldn't care less about this. He evidently knew there had been a problem and we had seen the waiter talking to other staff about us yet the implication seemed to be that we were the ones at fault and that they had no interest in trying to make our experience a good one. Never mind the fact that we paid nearly \u00a340 for a brunch that we couldn't finish because we felt too uncomfortable to be there any more. What a terrible shame that good food and a lovely setting are spoiled by rude and disinterested service. They must be doing awfully well in these recession hit times to be able to afford to treat customers so poorly.update: received a mail from the manager apologising for the bad service and saying will pass the matter on to the owner. Very nice and fast response. Seems that they may have been having a bad day and after corresponding with the manager I am keen to go back and see if the food is as delicious as it looked.",

    "text": "When confronted with the word 'fusion' I normally tend to add the suffix 'schmusion', as many fusion restaurants seem to be ill-thought out attempts to jump on a bandwagon that rolled out of town in the early noughties. However, the Modern Pantry bucks this trend with incredible attention to detail and mouth-watering food. We arrived on a cold monday night to be greeted with warm, attentive service from the onset, with our server coming across as friendly and in control of the room. We sat at a communal table and began to drool over the menu; every dish sounded delicious and intriguing, with the food taking in elements of rustic French and British grub, Asian flavours and Pacific elements. They say the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and Modern Pantry was certainly not all talk and no trousers [I'm all about the cheesy British sayings tonight aren't I?]. To start we shared a sugar-cured prawn omelette, which has to be the best omelette I've ever had in my life- Just wet enough, with four massive prawns, spring onions, chilli and a myriad other thai style flavours all nestled under a smoked chilli sambal, which was basically an earthy jam. For mains I had duck confit with a quinoa cake, greens and tamarind jam which was beautifully balanced and moreish, whilst my companion had a beef shin stew flavoured with tamarind and served with parsnip mash and crisps which was equally tongue-pleasing. Then dessert; I'm normally the type to share desserts, but everything on the menu sounded so delicious we ended up getting one each AND some of their divine Valrhona truffles, and we definitely made the right choice, as both the absolutely inspired Pina Colada trifle and the chocolate truffle torte were perfect- not too sweet, just rich enough and plate-lickingly good. This place is getting deserved praise in the papers at the moment with a nine out of ten in the Guardian's Weekend magazine last week, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking to try something a bit special.",

Take your time: it won't be easy to arrive at the decision on what to order.The delicately tender ricotta pancakes, eggs with fried haloumi cheese, and just about anything else on the menu would be fresh, delicious, and happiness-inducing.",

The menu offers the usual brunch fare, but with interesting tweaks - eggs with halloumi or chorizo, tea smoked salmon, coconut and cassava pancakes, cured prawn omelette. The elderflower, mint and earl grey iced tea was sublime. The only disappointment was that they were all out of pastries! Serves us right for turning up at 12... Well worth a visit, but book if you can. Lunch menu looked excellent as well, so planning a return trip for that",

    "text": "I'm glad more and more decent cafes are opening up around Clerkenwell, especially since it's very convenient for me. I'm therefore very glad that The Modern Pantry opens its cafe for breakfast Saturday and Sunday offering a decent selection from basics such as toast and porridge, to the more exotic sugar cured prawn omelette or feta and onion waffle. Our group decided to try the ricotta pancakes, grape and stone fruit compote, creme fraiche and one of the classic fry up (with poached eggs instead). The dining room is bright, helped by the large windows that surround two of the large walls. They also have a small bar area that people ended up standing in to avoid the squall-like downpours whilst they waited to be seated. It seemed to get quite busy the closer it seemed to lunchtime. The coffee is reasonable, and with ex-Providores experience, a flat white order was taken without question. When it arrived, it was certainly a decent brew, although looked a bit lacklustre when it arrived. The breakfast menu is reasonably priced, and with high quality tasting ingredients I really couldn't complain. The fry up came with perfectly poached eggs (the white just cooked with the yolk still runny) and flavourful tomatoes, mushrooms and salty streaky bacon crisp and not burnt. The pancakes on the other hand slightly disappointed. They were fluffy and light, yet the stone fruit compote towered over the small golden discs, and upset the delicate balance that should have been presented. With a decent breakfast offering, I'd be interested to see what a proper lunch and dinner menu would look like in the upstairs dining rooms. It's a welcome addition to the area, and a great place to meet up with friends.",

That's why she's so miserable\") to give her the benefit of the doubt, then you're doing more of the hard work for any decent restaurant than you should rightly have to. I haven't been to Providores for years but the breakfast there was legendary. I'm not convinced that the inspired cooking has been transferred over here, though I believe that's where Modern Pantry's head chef used to work. This feels like a slightly more sanitised, less heart, less confidence version of the Garrison in Bermondsey. We had brunch - waffles with bacon and maple syrup and frou-frou pea shoots, fruit salad, a croissant, an affogato and a share of the bottles of Prosecco on the table - which worked out to \u00a350 for two. We were there with excellent company which made the afternoon but I think there are many many places nearby doing much better food, in equally comfortable surroundings, without the begrudged service for the same or much less cash.",

Nicely done and I ordered the fruit salad with rose syrup, which was light and refreshing. Their prosecco sorbet was quite good, although my stomach wasn't able to handle it after one spoonful. But they were very nice about it, took it away and I replaced it with the fruit salad and was not charged for the sorbet. The owner/manager was very sweet and asked after me about the sorbet.

My tempura mackerel entree was awesome, but I was slightly jealous of those who ordered the sashimi which was melt in your mouth stuff, and the onglet steak and moi moi and kalamata mash was really good. The Kiwi and Aussie wines beautifully complemented the meal also. Possibly the only downside with the menu was that there was almost too much on there. Every choice seemed to have that one ingredient too much (as an earlier reviewer put it). The big downside was probably a lack of attentiveness and engagement by the guy looking after our table, which I think is a real deal breaker for a restaurant, and hence only 3 out of 5.",
