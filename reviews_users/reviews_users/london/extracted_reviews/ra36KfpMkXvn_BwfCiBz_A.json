The first time was for breakfast with a work colleague. They have a good selection of healthy breakfasts including green juice. More recently we have been twice for dinner. The second time both myself and my partner had burgers and fries. They were excellent. Our favourite is probably still the Hawksmoor but the Hoi Polloi burgers were perfectly cooked with a good \"salad\" interior including celery and a slight mustardy sauce. In fact, writing this is making me feel like another one! Another good thing about Hoi Polloi is you don't need to book weeks in advance, as there are often plenty of last minute tables ... which means we can go back tonight.",

    "text": "'Sanj M' describes this place perfectly.If you walk past the main hotel entrance, you can access the restaurant through a flower shop; smells really nice and just a much cooler way to enter. The restaurant itself is bright, airy and has really high ceilings. Tables are somewhat near each other but overall the place itself feels spacious. Decor features a lot of light wood and is very modern.Once seated, you're handed the menu which has that large flimsy free magazine sort of feel. Another nice touch.They also have a string quartet at Sunday brunch. These guys absolutely made the meal. It was just so nice! They play fairly popular songs and are really good.Everything I've just described is amazing but sadly the food is forgettable. We ordered the French toast with bacon, french toast with berries, boiled eggs and soldiers (the eggs are too small), ricotta pancakes and the duck egg with mushrooms and chilli on toast. The duck egg on toast was really simple but probably the stand out dish.Take note that the portions tend towards the smaller side.The only other thing to note is that the service is particularly slow. We didn't really mind given that everything about the place was so laid-back but on another day it might have been annoying.Ultimately I'd happily return for Sunday brunch because it's just such a nice vibe with the string quartet. Not sure if I'd particularly recommend checking it out at other times though (but perhaps the non-brunch food might be more impressive).",

We are all fans of the ACE Hotels in NYC and LA so we figured it would be a good bet. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Upon arrival to an EMPTY dining room except for a table of two, they informed us at 5:30pm (the time of our booking) that they were no longer serving tea and were preparing for dinner service. The website and the paper menus all state they serve tea until 6pm. The hostess who broke the no-tea news then dismissively turned around and returned to slicing bread. It was pretty unbelievable. Basically, they ruined our afternoon and they were completely unapologetic about the entire ordeal. Bonus: I received an email from OpenTable the next day to say we skipped out on our reservation! The bottom line is that this place is overhyped. The empty restaurant on a Friday, when it is supposed to be stylish and cool, is evidence of the fact that it is neither. \u00a0Truth be told, having tea alone in an empty dining room wouldn't have been very fun anyway, so many it was meant to be.",

After hearing rave reviews about Hoi Polloi from friends and colleagues, I was excitedly looking forward to a long lazy sunday brunch with a group of friends over some delicious food and quality gossip. Popped in with no reservation and was swiftly escorted to a table close to the door. Service was friendly and attentive, without being over-bearing, and surprise-surprise, no snooty Shoreditch attitude! Tick!I ordered Pancakes with Bacon and Syrup, and a couple of glasses of their freshly squeezed mixed juices. My friends ordered a variety of mains from the menu (the names escapes me) and a selection of the sides/nibbles. The food arrived quite quickly - another tick! However... the food was just... OK. I've had much better pancakes and bacon. The pancakes were quite thin and bland, and the syrup was just far too sweet for my palate. Overall I thought, although the service was good, I couldn't help thinking how much the food had let it down. OK, so the food wasn't terrible, but for something as simple as brunch it's not exactly complicated cooking and therefore for an establishment like Hoi Polloi it does make you wonder is this another case of style over substance?",

Clearly if you had ordered a dessert for a a vegan they aren't going to suddenly convert. I also noticed there was Parmesan on their plate on the main so it was completely ignored. When we came to leave they were also terrible at helping us find our luggage and passed us between multiple staff members which I thought was very poor.

Well, we went from the hotel entrance, So we got peek of the hotel here. Then here we were, I have to say, when I first walk in, it really gave me a wow moment, I didn't expect such grand and beauty place around this area. But there was it. \u00a0The place didn't really have much decoration, contrary, it looked really simple but yet very pop and modern. The geomantic style of lamp sort of remind me the style of Great Gatsby, it made me feel like I was living at that period for second.Soon we got our table, the waiter brought menu, I had a quick look of the menu, the price of this place was less expensive than I expected, but yet also I wouldn't cheap. I think, that was quite acceptable considering the place like that. It took me a second, and then I found the page for Brunch. There quite a lot options. I was a bit full, so I just ordered a Caesar Salad and some mixed berries and a pot of Earl Grey. They did somehow mess up my ordered, just brought me blue berry instead of mixed berries, but they did changed that after we mentioned it. The Salad was nice, my friend also ordered some other dish, which I did tried them as well. I like the taste of them. Overall I think this is cool place to have brunch, the place is so neat. And I think it isn't very noisy, great to have conversation with the other, it also got a music group performs music with just instruments, some pop and some classic. We were enjoying music quite a lot. It was good time here. there is also nice florist shop at the exit/entrance of Hoi Polloi, I'm not sure if they belong together, but it was a really lovely shop. I'm really glad that my friend took us here.",

Ending on a positive note, they made me smile with the string quartet playing 80s songs for Sunday brunch \u00a0--this is where they nail hipster in an oh-so-great way. \u00a0Props for creativity and humor on that choice.",

    "text": "Having been enraptured by the glorious 'Sunday Strings' concept here (the string quartet playing popular tunes while you eat), I led some more friends here through the secret florist's entrance for brunch this weekend to share the love.Our booking was at 12.15pm from the 'Weekend Brunch' menu, which starts at 12pm. Sadly most of the items on here that had also been on the 'Breakfast' menu from 8-12 had already run out. That included my first choice, the avocado, chilli and poached eggs on toast, as well as my second choice, the eggs florentine, as they'd run out of spinach. Disaster. Now Sunday brunch has got to be their busiest service period of the week and yet they seemed to be woefully unprepared for the fact that 'the avocado and eggs florentine have been flying out the kitchen this morning!' as the waitress told us. That was no surprise to me - why was it a surprise to them?!I was quite disappointed for a time (and half tempted to pop out and buy an avocado from up the road). But sought solace in a pear and prosecco cocktail that cheered me up. Sadly for my mate's girlfriend they were even missing an ingredient for her drink too so had to make her a tweaked 'Dizzy Dolly' cocktail. Luckily my third choice pancakes with bacon and maple syrup arrived generously sized, fat and fluffy and made me the subject of food envy from the boys, particularly the mate that ordered the smoked salmon and got a decidedly stingy portion!The food was thus much more hit and miss this visit in terms of value for money, and the amount of ingredients out of stock was quite unacceptable. I'd mark them down even further were it not for the string quartet - who were again quite brilliant - and the best cappuccino I've tasted in ages. Let's hope they've learned their lesson - I know I'll be booking an earlier sitting next time to make sure!",

I'm also a fan of the various drinks available and the atmosphere is always quite lively due to the mixed bag of clientele from the local area and staying next door in the fabulous Ace Hotel.I always bump into total oddballs either at the bar or even sat at a table, and these random interactions usually make the visit worth it just on their own. (If you're oddball adverse I'm sure you can probably avoid this).Top tip: If you want a last minute table, pop onto OpenTable and book there 15 minutes in advance; walk-ins often result in waiting around for much longer than that for no real good reason. (Presumably as a solo diner I'm somewhat discriminated against but last time I was there it took me over an hour to get seated despite there being tables available on OpenTable the whole time!)",

    "text": "Can you really go wrong with pancakes?Yes. The answer is yes. Though simple, the pancake is the most often massacred breakfast food and Hoi Polloi deserves four stars just for the fact that they flip up a darn tasty stack of pancakes. I was staying at the Ace Hotel on my most recent trip to London and had the pleasure of sitting down with the infamous Alex S and his lovely cohort in crime for brunch. The restaurant/diner is located within the hotel and though it is pretty bare bones in terms of decor, it lends to the diner feel of the space. With it's bench/booth seating, it reminds me of old truck stops back home... except truck stops that a hipster designed, because it's still in the Ace afterall.I ordered juice (Sunshine), pancakes with bacon and maple syrup and a side of sausage. Why bacon and sausage? I feel sorry for you if you have to ask that. Let's start off with the not so fine: I would pass on the side of sausage next time around or any of the other sides for that matter - they are pretty tiny portions for what you pay for. But that's the only thing that stood out as a red flag here. The juice was great. In fact, I went back twice for the same juice to keep me perking along through the weekend, and the pancakes were top notch. Right amount of dense to fluffy and not skimping on the syrup. Tasty indeed. The prices for brunch were a little high, but I feel like that is more my unfamiliarity with London than anything (it makes me weep when I see how much you all spend on cocktails). Though I don't think it will be a future \"destination\" spot, if i'm back in town and staying at the Ace again, I would definitely hit this place up for breakfast.",

The company was grand, the food less so.The chickpea fritters lacked oomph. Thank goodness for the accompanying aioli to perk them up slightly.The cauliflower cheese was done with an extremely strong cheese - so strong that no one at my table could stand the smell of it, much less the taste. Pretty disappointing if you love traditional cauliflower cheese in all its mildness.I ordered broccoli with anchovy crumbs, but received broccoli with salt cod (which I had had more than my fill of in Portugal two weeks prior). I inquired when it arrived and was assured it was the correct dish. Still puzzled, I consulted the menu to figure out the mystery. After another inquiry the dish was swapped out for the one I'd ordered.Dripping chips were wonderful. (When are they not?) I also enjoyed the cocktails. In this neighb you're spoiled for choice.

First experience was with room service. I ordered the burger which comes with a side of chips. Burger was nothing special, more on the small side, and fairly bland. Chips were good. In keeping with the hotel style where plastic dish-bin style trays are used for storage in the rooms, they use the same thing for serving room service. In the rooms it works - to serve food in, you feel like they ran out of trays and grabbed a bus bin normally filled with dirty dishes collected when bussing a table at the end of a meal. Just doesn't come off well. The next experience was this morning when I thought rather than going to the coffee shop in the hotel (which is rather good) I would go for a more substantial breakfast. \u00a0After getting seated you're given what appears to be a newspaper which is the menu. Kinda cool though it seems that the menus have been used quite a bit. Anyway, the place wasn't all that busy but the staff seem oblivious to people. I sat at the table with my newspaper menu, no water, no coffee, nothing for close to 15 minutes as a couple of servers walked pat me several times. I believe one accidentally let me catch his eye but that didn't seem to spark any notion of coming over to the table. I eventually got up, grabbed my bag and walked out. I am pretty sure the host saw me leave but like the rest of the staff, didn't really seem to care and didn't say anything.It's not often I give a 1 star rating for a place but neither of my experiences warrant anything more. With so many options now in the Shoreditch area, you should skip this one and you won't miss anything. Too bad as the Ace hotel itself is really great and I'm really enjoying that. Too bad the restaurant can't add to the positive experience.",
