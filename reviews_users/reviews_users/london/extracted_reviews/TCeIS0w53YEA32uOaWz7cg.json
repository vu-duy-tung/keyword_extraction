    "text": "This is really a great restaurant. Its not particularly cheap, but its a premium restaurant in the centre of London, near one of the capital's most well known landmarks, Trafalgar Square. I can't recommend one particular meal here. There are so many good dishes. The staff are extremely friendly and can help you decide. Inside, its fairly sophisticated, the sort of place you could take out your partner, conduct a business meeting or go for a family meet up. Downstairs, there is a club linked to the restaurant, and its also quite sophisticated. I haven't been in it on the weekends so I don't know how busy it is, but overall, if you want a good evening in one place, which is guaranteed to be top class, or combine it with nearby galleries, I would say Thai Square ticks all the boxes. Charing Cross is the closest tube station.",

However, I was pleased to find it is actually pretty reasonable - averaging at just over \u00a310 for a main and side, so i decided to go there with some family last week. We wanted something special but not overly formal and what an excellent choice it turned out to be. The hotel-like entrance complete with fountains and gold decor, along with waitresses dressed in evening wear give the allusion of grandeur, and the views out to Trafalgar Square are amazing. Better than this was the food, which was amazing. I had a green thai curry, and others went for sweet and sour chicken and cashew nuts. All was beautifully served and couldn't be faulted on taste. The wine was also excellent.I am simply amazed by this place. The food, location, decor and service could command a much higher price, but instead you can enjoy a night of privilege without coming near to breaking the bank. I couldn't recommend it more.",

We got there at ten to three when they close their lunch kitchen at three but they happily accomodated us. Their pad thai blew me away. Best I have had. A nice clean, well decorated place with great service. It is a white table cloth restaurant, but there were lots of people dressed very informally. It looked like a lot of local business people come for lunch, which itself is a good recommendation. We were wanting to try out several places in London, but this was so good we had to come back for dinner. I had a lamb curry with coconut rice that was really outstanding. They did not even serve it with a knife because none was needed. The meat fell off the bone with a light touch of the fork. The curry sauce was rich and delectable. My wife had the pad thai noodles because she was so impressed after tasting mine at lunch, and she was delighted with them also. Highly recommended.",

The good news is that service was dramatically better than before (2 years back) and the food was simply outstanding. The decor was very nice but the music didn't seem to match. \u00a0The hostess was very welcoming and sat us quickly and exactly where we wanted. The waitresses where very nice, efficient and always present but not intrusive throughout the meal. They were also accommodated our request for items not on the menu. We started with a appetizer sampler with satay chicken, dumplings, crab cakes, shrimp toast, and fried spring rolls. All were very tasty and fresh with nice flavorful slightly spicy peanut sauce \u00a0and a spicy sweet chilly sauce. Neither of our entrees, ginger chicken and chicken pad siew, were on the menu but both were outstanding. The ginger chicken had excellent flavoring without over doing the ginger and the chicken and vegetables were fresh and nicely cooked (My wife thought it was one of the best she has ever had). The chicken pad siew was also outstanding with noodles, chicken and vegetables perfectly cooked. Although the flavor differs from what I am used to in the US it was still very, very good. Lastly the chocolate molten cake with vanilla pod ice cream was decadent without going overboard and was one of the best I have had (the only competitor would be the one from Gotham Bar and Grill in New York). Overall the food was good to the point that you want to lick the plate clean. I definitely planning on going here again!Note: It was nice that the are open until 10:30 pm.",

I must admit, the decor at this particular branch is beautiful - ornate decoration, attention to detail and traditional costume for the girl providing the music. Maybe it was because it was a Friday night, but the service wasn't the greatest. They took forever to take our order and when they eventually took the order, the starter came out first - before even getting the drinks. To add to the evening, we had a rocky table, so we had to get that fixed (i.e the waiter crawled under our table and shoved folded bits of their menu under the table leg - all very awkward lol); a bee was circling my wine glass, so had to get that replaced. In addition, considering we booked a table, I think we were just given some random table that was free - disappointingly, the table by the door . All in all, a rather disappointing evening, with mediocre food and service.",

Lots of flavor in the food. The egg fried rice couldve been more fried and more eggy though seriously. It was like they chopped up an egg and threw it in some steamed rice so I wasn't too happy with that.The person I was with got some noodles with giant shrimp in them and I thought it was really good. Don't like how they automatically add gratuity - you would normally get more if you didn't force people to pay it.Good place to stop for lunch or dinner definitely. In a nice area with Trafalgar Square just across the street. \u00a0Def check it out if you get a chance.",

When the water came, we were surprised and she immediately opened the bottle and pour into our glasses before we can do anything, and have to pay for it. Remember to always ask whether water served is complimentary or not. Spoke with the manager who insisted that's how the business is run and we have to specifically ask for tap water if we want free water. Pretty much spoiled the whole dining experience. Don't bother with the pad see ew, one of the worst I've eaten so far. It looked and taste as it was simmered with soy sauce rather than actual stir fry.",

    "text": "I'm working my way through London - one thai restaurant at a time. On a cold, rainy day (which a vast majority have been over the past couple of months) I end up craving spicy, hot thai or indian. \u00a0Thai Square is an upscale thai chain. \u00a0This one is located off of Trafalgar Square, so attracts its fair share of tourists and while ingredient quality, service and decor are nice --- you pay for the location. \u00a0Here are my other thoughts:- Decor 4 stars: Nice white linen setting with high ceilings. \u00a0There's an upstairs dining area - but choose something next to the window if you can to watch the crowds go by. \u00a0During dinner a woman was in the main dining room playing thai music.- Service 4 stars : Very good - prompt, friendly. - Menu 4+ stars: Extensive menu for both those that like spicy and non-spicy, familiar to less familiar - so good for everyone. \u00a0 \u00a0Typical starters - tempura, Satay,, curries, soups, veggie menu etc. Nice \"Family or Date\" 2-3 course menu options available for 2+ people. Like most places they charge extra for rice --- which I skipped.Good wine list. My Meal 3-4 Stars: \u00a0I had the Tom Yum Goong Soup with Shrimp, and a House Special Prawn and Scallops with garlic, sweet peas and baby corn. \u00a0On the plus side: terrific high-quality and well cooked ingredients: great big prawns, perfectly cooked scallops/prawns in both dishes, pea pods, baby corn, shitake mushrooms in the soup.Flavor wasn't as good as I hoped on the prawn/scallop dish ( for some reason there's no soy, hot chili sauce, pepper - or well, \u00a0anything- \u00a0to amp it up on your own.). \u00a0Both had a lot of oil in them that overwhelmed the freshness of those great ingredients. BOTTOM LINE: So, it's a nice place, in a good location serving fresh quality ingredient dishes with authentic flavors. Probably, a really great place for a date. But, while independently I'd give everything 4-stars - I've given it an A-OK 3 star rating. All that still didn't add up to a great \u00a0value to me.given the prices and size of what was provided.",

I have to say, Thai Square is very nice, felt swanky, hence the reason for no food pics, just felt like I shouldn't haha.I started with Chicken Satay, it's the peanut sauce that I really crave and well I wanted to see if it's just as good in London as it is in Phoenix and yep it's amazing! The chicken had great flavor, it is sort of sad to cover it with the peanut sauce for it could stand on its own, but omg I love the peanut sauce and since I can't just eat with a spoon its best it goes on the chicken. For my drink I ordered the Thai Tea, it was perfectly blended and tasted great! For the main dish, I went with the Panang Beef Thai Hot (been told food in London is bland so I was thinking Thai Hot really wasn't going to be hot on my heat scale) . This was prime beef that had been slow cooked in coconut cream and Panang curry paste and it was garnished with lime leaves, I also ordered a side of coconut rice. When the meal came out it looked amazing, the server placed the food on the table then served me, that's right, she placed curry on my plate followed by some rice, felt kind of spoiled. \u00a0The Panang Beef was amazing, the flavors the texture, oh so good! And going Thai Hot was perfect for me. That was a great curry dish. Now I'll have to find it here in Phoenix or cook it myself.Glad to have found Thai Square on my Yelp App, look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "Favorite thai restaurant when we are in London. We enjoyed the starter which is called golden sacks (shrimp ball), thai papaya salad, massamum curry, fried flat rice noodle, pad Thai, and tamarind duck. The pre theatre menu is half price before 7.30pm, what a good deal for good food. \u00a0Service is top and sometimes they offered prawn crackers (not sure why it is not consistent in my every visit). Recommended to colleagues and friends and they love it too.",
