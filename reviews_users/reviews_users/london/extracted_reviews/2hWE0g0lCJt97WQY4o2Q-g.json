The second time around, about eight months later, I decided to give them a second chance and went for a falafel with guacamole on pita. Colour me most unimpressed. I couldn't taste any guacamole, my pita was lukewarm, and, the only thing I registered was that the falafel was crunchy. This may be sacrilegious but I prefer the falafel from Pret. Not only is it cheaper, but it tastes better too.",

    "text": "Pilpel is absolutely my favorite lunch spot . There are probably enough restaurants around Spitalfields Market that you could go to a different one every day and not eat at the same place twice in 3 months. Pilpel opened a little over a month ago , and I've got my lunch there there around a half-dozen times.Pilpel is a very simple eatery- the name gives you the width and breadth of the menu: falafel and houmous. There's dozens of different options for how you can have your falafel (with aubergines, carrots, cucumber salad, olives etc.) but if falafel isn't what you're after then this isn't your place. If you are after falafel though, then this is where you should go. It's absolutely the best stuff I've had in London.You can have a good lunch here for less than a fiver, served to you by a cheerful staff (and more often than not, the owner). They just set up some tables outside, too - so if you've got a long lunch break you can sit oin the sun with your meal.",

    "text": "Pilpel is without a doubt the best meal (or 50 meals) that I had during my semester studying abroad in London. Let's start with the food. Pilpel keeps it simple. They do falafel, and they do it better than just about anyone else. Upon entering the restaurant, you place your order at the counter. You can either order your falafel in a pita, or opt for it on a bed of your choice of fresh toppings. You can choose from a variety of crisp vegetables and flavorful spreads, such as carrots, chickpeas, red and white cabbage, tabbouleh, carrots, jalapenos, pickled cucumbers and lettuce. Personally, I load up my pita with a little bit of everything, as I find that all of the flavors blend together magically to create a little slice of heaven inside that pita. Last, but certainly not least, you'll be asked what sauces and spreads you would like added. You must get extra tahini sauce. I REPEAT, YOU MUST GET EXTRA TAHINI SAUCE. This is the key to creating the best falafel pita you will ever have. Also make sure to ask for a little chilli sauce to spice things up, and some hummus. For .60p extra, you can choose to add feta, aubergine, guacamole, or a hard boiled egg. I enjoy adding feta or guacamole when I'm feeling a little feisty, but find the aubergine a little too salty. Every single person that I've brought here, and I seemed to bring just about anyone I knew in London during my time there, fell in love with this place. This became my go-to place to have a quick lunch or dinner, and it's perfect for those on a budget, as portions are large and prices are pretty low, at least for London.The employees here are always smiling and will never hesitate to help you out if you have a question or want a recommendation. On my last day in town, they even gave me a free Pilpel shirt to wear back here in the States. Great service is just the cherry on top of this scrumptious, fantastic cake. Next time you're in the Spitalfields area, make sure to check out Pilpel. Even if you're not in the area, it's worth a tube ride to check this gem out.",

And off I trotted to this place the following week and considering the non-trivial walk from my workplace to this establishment, I figured I was setting myself up for a disappointment. But voila, what's this I see? A fast moving queue, friendly staff, crisp and fresh salad items layered up on a bed of the most delish houmous, a generous portion of six falafels (yes, six!) all packed neatly in a box and most unexpectedly, a generous portion of the home-baked flatbread too! I had asked for a topping off aubergines too and I thought it was a nice \u00a0touch...At a mere 5.40quid or thereabouts, I was pleased to note that I was well satiated and felt full even up to the point that I sat down to dinner later that day.This is obviously designed to be a take-away place but there are a few wooden stools about the place and I ate in there, noting the busy but quick turnaround at the counter. My only qualm about the place was the excessive packaging including box lids and big brown paper bags given to all customers regardless of their intent to eat in...the mass of brown paper bag in the trashbin seemed like needless waste.That apart, I think I have found myself a new lunch place for days when I fancy a bit of a walk :)",

It's not a place to sit down, but rather a place to pick up and eat outside on a bench or take back to your desk. The menu is pretty straightforward and offers made-from-scratch falafel and houmous on the premises. If you're adventurous and unafraid of making a mess, go for the goods with all the salad inside a pitta, but if you're like me, you'll spend an extra 50p and put it in a container. My lunch took me two days to eat! That's how big the portion was...and cheap too! This is definitely a nice, healthy and fast addition to the many food spots in the area. Let the vegetarians rejoice!",

    "text": "I always used to say that I didn't like falafel until I was offered a taster as I walked past Pilpel. Absolute game changer!The falafel itself was suprisingly tasty and not greasy at all considering that it is fried. There are pretty much 2 main options for how you can have it. Either in a pitta (white or brown) or in a container (with or without pitta). I find that the container is slightly too much and much prefer the pitta as it's easier to get the flavour of everything together.This is where it really comes into it's own. Houmous comes as standard along with tahini and chilli sauce if that's what floats your boat. I tend to lay off the tahini as I think both sauces tend to soak into the bread making it slightly messy. If I wasn't usually eating in work this wouldn't be a problem at all! You can then follow this up with a selection of fresh salad items adding different textures and enhancing the flavour.There's a number of other options that you can pay a little extra to get such as guacamole, sun dried tomatoes and aubergine although in my opinion they aren't really worth the additional cost. Prices are really good, especially for the area with the pitta coming in at \u00a34.80 and the container only \u00a31 more. If you haven't tried Pilpel yet you need to get yourself along and you won't be sorry. In fact you might even see me there!",

    "text": "The McDonald's of falafel, cheap but utterly mediocre. The falafel is decent, worthy of around three or four stars on its own, but unfortunately everything else fails to hit the same level. The pitas served are poor, lacking in fluffiness and various flavors, leaving you with bland, overly chewy dough that takes away from the goodness inside. The other toppings as well lacked the taste of freshness and seemed like left-overs from school canteen salads. And don't get me started on the hummus and the chili and tahini sauces... I reckon that if one had those blind-tasted by random people, none would guess correctly what they just had. They were so bland and flat I completely forgot they even spread them inside. In my opinion, Pilpel just cannot compare against good, authentic falafel stalls. The lone highlights are the rightly cheap price, the well-cooked falafel and the perception of eating healthily when all you're tasting is uncooked frozen salad.",

I ordered a standard falafel with all of the salads and extra hot sauce. The pita was as big as my face, and I yet I probably finished it in less than five minutes. Well worth the 5 quid and before I left, I thanked the staff for such a delicious meal. Then, the staff did something which I did not expect.

Here's what you should do, when you come here:1) Decide if you're super-hungry (2a) or just hungry (2b). (Don't come here if you're just peckish)2a) Right, you're super-hungry. In that case I suggest you go for the falafel salad in a box. For extra protein and deliciousness, I'd add an egg for an extra 60p. (And if you really want to go crazy, add that dollop of tasty guacamole as well!)2b) You're hungry? Go for the classic falafel sandwich in pita bread - make sure to get the wholemeal pita, as your health will thank you for it! (You can certainly also add all the extras as described above, but let me tell you that eating this will be a messy undertaking!)Now, last but not least, please make sure that especially if you're going for option 2b, you take plenty of napkins with you - as you will need them!",

They guided me well and I had pita bread with lots of salads and falafel... Yummy!!! I soon recommended it to my colleagues who did know about it. One can have a nice wholesome lunch when you don't want to have meat or chicken stuffs.",

    "text": "This isn't the best falafel ever. I wish I could take those who have said so round the corner to the pop-up 'Falafel House' and get them to reconsider.However, the portions are generous and the combinations are well thought-out. A little dry in my opinion but all the ingredients are fresh and service is a real delight.Not sure I would choose this place if I was hankering for a falafel if I'm honest, but nice ideas.",
