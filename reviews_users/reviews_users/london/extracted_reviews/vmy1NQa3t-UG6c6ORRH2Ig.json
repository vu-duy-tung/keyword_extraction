It was a welcome oasis during our stay in London, as the service we had gotten in other establishments was spotty at best. But here? Everyone was smiling and super friendly and totally made me wish we had found this place sooner. Being from the US, I had never had sticky toffee pudding before and was eager to try it. Wow, it was amazing, and now I brought home a recipe to try out for myself. If you want a friendly, non pretentious British pub look no further.",

When I first walked in I was a bit disappointed as I felt that not being able to sit outside, it was quite a non-atmospheric environment and all a bit dark and dingy, however my opinion swiftly changed. Firstly when booking I wasn't allowed to reserve a table outside however the lady advised she'd sort a table inside and if we could get one outside she would happily move us. When we arrived she had remembered this and offered to move us outside (which we declined for poor weather). We stayed inside and the service was great. Table service for all drinks which we got regularly, no waiting around, reasonable prices and the food was AMAZING. Most of us had roast dinners and the portions were great, well presented and tasted yummy. Peanut butter cookie dough cheese cake is A MUST and I'll be going back just to have that! I like this pub despite the 'plain' interior, and would happily go back again for a Sunday lunch catch up or similar (not necessarily for a heavy party night out).",

If you are just coming from Europe then know that water is by the bar and you can get it yourself. (This made us happy!)",

I must start off by saying the whole bland food, warm beer thing is a complete myth, and this places proves that.I stumbled upon this pub while searching for some sustenance before participating in my first Carnival. Upon checking in, I received a free pint. I wasn't sure this would be an option since there was an event going on and it seemed as though they cleared out some of the tables. I ordered the burger w/ cheese and fries. The fries weren't chips, which I quickly learned are different things. I loved how crispy they were on the outside and smooth in the inside. The burger was soooo good! As a foodie, I know a a good burger and this is one of them. A good burger is one that doesn't need the frills of added toppings. It's a simple burger with good quality meat. That is what you will get here. I highly recommend!",

The Camembert starter is one of the greatest things I've ever had and to be honest, I'm going to try to find a way to get this back at home. We ordered the meat pie and bangers and mash, and hardly talked because we couldn't stop eating. Afterwards we had the sticky toffee pudding and as much as we knew we ate a lot of food, there was no regret. We plan on making this place a regular stop when we come back to the UK and highly recommended anyone to go. The quality of the food and great service can't be beat.",

    "text": "After almost a month of living in Notting Hill, I finally made it to The Champion for dinner. This place was literally advertised in my move-in packet as being \"right around the corner\" and \"a great place to grab after-work drinks with mates\" (loosely paraphrasing, but still) so I had to try it. Little did I know, it was pub quiz night - luckily, the quiz takes place in the main foyer, and I was able to grab a table downstairs in a cute, secluded part of the restaurant.You order at the bar upstairs, and take your seats and wait for table service. Kind of haphazard, but it makes sense the way the restaurant is set up. Service is quick and friendly.It's perfectly standard pub food (coming from someone that has been to a single pub) - the fish and chips were really good once I doused them in vinegar while they were still hot. Their sides - roasted vegetables & salad - were pretty unimpressive. The veggies, which I envisioned as being a few different kinds of vegetables, were just some half-roasted yams, and the salad was undressed lettuce and a slice of tomato.I'm sure there are more \"classic\" London pubs, but if you're craving fish & chips or something else greasy and are in the Notting Hill area, you'd do worse than to go to The Champion.",

It was the very first place we ate after getting off the plane from LA, and after the initial experience, we were enchanted, and had to go back.

We were a group of six (two of which were children under the age of 12) but lucky for us, the Mercury Lounge downstairs was open and had seating (the main dining room upstairs was jam packed). We had the downstairs lounge for most of our visit (occasional smokers would come down to smoke in the outdoor patio off of the lounge).While we sat downstairs, one had to order at the bar upstairs. They bring down the food when it is ready. The menu was typical English pub grub. I again opted for the fish and chips... I have not quite yet found the best one yet, but thought I'd try at a place called \"the Champion\". It was definitely good! I upsized my order, and probably should have had the regular size.Service here was decent. The staff seemed a bit disorganized when it came time to check out. We settled the bill upstairs (I guess everything is done at the bar). No one seemed to know which table we were. After about what seemed like an eternity, the person who took our order showed up and \"remembered\" our table and printed out our check. We did not realize until we got back to our hotel and checking our credit card receipt that we actually paid for the table who later came downstairs after us!",

One of our friends had brought her dog and they quickly brought out a bowl of water for him which was so attentive! For the humans, the food came quick and with generous portions. The vegetarian Sunday roast was quite nice with well cooked sides and lots of gravy.

We tried a lot of different food options ranging from the fish and chips to and sausage and bangers to the quinoa burger. \u00a0All were great!They have a great beer selection that kept us wanting to try more!It was pretty busy and service was pretty good considering how busy it was. \u00a0Staff was pleasant and happy to explain the different beer selection. The fish and chips were on point. \u00a0I had fish and chips 6 different times while in the UK and this was top 3.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in London for one week and came here 3 times. It was the very first place we ate, and after the initial experience we were haunted by the food and had to go back. In case you are already sold after my first two sentences and are looking at the rest of this review like lol tl;dr, I want to quickly leave you with this pro tip: make a reservation online if you want to eat dinner / want a table in the evening. One of the dishes that made us pine for the Champion after the first visit was the slow-cooked ox cheek and mashed potatoes. The meat was melt in your mouth. We're not sure what they put in their mash, but it's magical... probably some of the best mash ever. Across our visits we had the bangers and mash, mac & cheese, beef pie, ox cheek, and sticky toffee pudding, and all of them were outstanding. The atmosphere is quite nice, the bartenders are friendly, and the beer selection is better than most pubs if you are a craft beer fan... they don't just have 6 different lagers on tap like a lot of pubs. They had the Meantime (Greenwich based) Hop Kick Pils on tap, which was likely the best pint we tasted in London.",

And he wasn't particularly appreciative or accommodating to our quandary. So confusing and weird. Definitely not a place to take kids. But again, I emphasize, their website has a kid's menu. Why????",
