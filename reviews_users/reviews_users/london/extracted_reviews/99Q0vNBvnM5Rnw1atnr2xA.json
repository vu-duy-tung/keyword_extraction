The rustic-style surrounds are matched by a simple menu featuring high-quality ingredients, best illustrated by the buffet, glistening with all sorts of fresh goodies. Otherwise, expect classic renditions such as of beef carpaccio with pesto and an equally no-nonsense selection of pizzas. With fair prices extending to the all-Italian wine list, Osteria is perfect for when you can't be bothered to cook at home but don't want to eat anything in the high end cuisine. The only problem is that Osteria's popularity makes it very noisy, though friendly staff are adept at keeping the mood upbeat.",

The only low point of our experience was the waiter - he's the most miserable man I've ever seen. But don't let this put you off - you should definitely go along and try this place in the classy area of Notting Hill. And 10 points if you can make the waiter smile.",

The bread they bring out for you is pretty food - very soft and crusty! \u00a0The pastas were also quite good. \u00a0He ordered the tagliatelle with a veal ragu and truffle oil, and I had the tortellini filled with spinach and ricotta in a creamy tomato sauce. \u00a0Both were great, but I have to admit the truffle oil made his dish - I have a weakness for truffle oil. The tortellini was tasty and sized like big ravioli - that tomato cream sauce was clutch, and the portions were decent as well. \u00a0Oh yeah, and to top it off, he had the waiters do the obligatory happy birthday song while they brought out a tiramisu with a candle on it - I covered my face with a napkin until the song was done, but once it was over I went to town on that tiramisu. \u00a0Clearly embarrassment has no effect on my appetite.",

The tuna I had was lovely, but it wasn't cooked rare like I asked. And honestly, the salad it came with was a little uninspiring. The new potatoes were peeled which was weird. There's not a huge amount of choice on the menu, but this is typical of Italian Trattorias. But, if you don't like veal, you're a bit stuck. I wished I'd gone for the lamb instead, but I do think five veal dishes on a menu is excessive. The wine was lovely, the staff were lovely, my strawberry ice cream was very very lovely indeed (I'd forgotten how much I loved that stuff). But it fell short for me. And I think if someone is paying \u00a318 for a tuna salad, it should be nothing short of outstanding. The whole place could also be made much nicer if they moved one of the tables. I nearly dipped my coat on someone's dinenr we were that close to them. There was a poor couple only two inches away from our table - we weren't being very loud, but it does kinda ruin the romantic atmosphere is you feel like you're on a table of six with complete strangers. I'm still yet to find a wonderful Italian in London. Osteria isn't it",

I prefer upstairs for the tall windows and the airy atmospher but downstairs is very cosy and great for winter evenings. I used to go with friends when going out in Notting Hill and I now come back with my family and our 2 daughters who love the food, especially the pasta and pizza that they love.

Running parallel to the Portobello Road, I skipped past the Electric in my skinny jeans and polka dotted flats. It was wonderful then, and I certainly wasn't disappointed last night by the food, prosecco or scintillating company, though the triumphant footballing Germans irked me somewhat! The evening: it was all Russian philosophy layered with meaning while the waiters jostled for position, debating where I was from and just why my mother hadn't taught me Italian (the family line). My St. Petersburg date attempted to educate with a spot of light Russian banter. I took mental notes, ready for a grilling. I shouldn't have scoffed the bread with balsamic and olive oil, but I did. The seafood linguine was decadence on a plate, the limoncello to complete the feast was glugged, St. Petersburg claimed it was rather like 'sticky vodka' but I didn't mind much. The bulk of food is currently residing in my fridge ready for consumption. Can you doggy bag it? Yes you can.",

I eat here at least three times a month and love love love every experience. though I tend to get the same meals as I find myself craving a certain dish (ie: black truffle pasta with homemade tagliatelle and rosemary) for days before giving in, but the service and quality is routine on point and consistently top notch. I prefer to eat upstairs for lunch as the sun shines in (and you can be close to the anti pasta buffet and fill up your plate with grilled aubergine, mozzarella, squid, etc..) and I prefer downstairs for dinner next to the faux fireplace and to be surround by candles in wine bottles. It can be quite pricey when you start with the wine and mains, but pastas are very reasonable. It is definitely worth it. When it comes to Italian outside of Italy, this is as good as it gets.",

She is very happy about the idea of going to Osteria Basilico: one of the favourite places for both of us, among the nicest Italian restaurants in London and for sure in Notting Hill.Located on a parallel street to Portobello Road, Osteria Basilico is a two-storey place with a nice atmosphere and very good quality food.The menu offers a nice variety, and also tends to change over time, which to me is a good sign.Top picks from my last dinner there:- Tortelloni with ricotta and spinach - a classic Italian- Tagliolini 'gamberetti & zucchine'- Chicken breast with avocadoGreat choice of wines - rigorously Italian - out of which we chose a good 2009 Chianti.Staff friendly and mostly Italian.Definitely worth trying, either with your significant one or with a group of friends!",

The wine is more expensive but they have quite a vast selection which is always nice. My favourite part is the amazing chicken salad (effectively a Caesar salad) which was quite perfect and then the beautifully presented veal escalope which I think is always a safe choice.I would definitely come here again for a definite fun night out.

    "text": "Nice little restaurant. We were there today around 6:45pm and it wasnt really crowned. It seems that there were a lot of reservations but luckily we got a seat without one. I wont say the people are really welcoming tho. And because it is such a small place it was a bit squeezing.The buffet starter was nice. Pay less and can try a lot of different things. Love the mix salad. I ordered the spaghetti with clams and it was delicious.Main courses are actually okay but the starter and drinks were a bit expensive. Two of us spent 75.25 but it was a nice experience. :)",

    "text": "We really enjoyed Osteria Basilico tonight. I'm glad we took this recommendation from the guy sitting next to us at Cecconi's on Saturday. Here's the food rundown: - Burrata with Parma Ham - Excellent - do it. - Tuna Tartare - found the dish to pretty creative incorporating in fruit, avocado and salad - Garlic Bread is actually a garlic bread pizza: wife loves garlic bread and I love anything I can put burrata or tartare on - Tortelloni filled w/ Spinach & Ricotta Cheese: Very good, wish I hadn't filled up on apps so I could have eaten more. Exceptional service. Get upstairs if you can - reserve early. I'd put this on your short list of meals in London if you're seeking out some really good Italian without breaking the bank.",

We got a table downstairs but as it was very hot we asked if we could be moved upstairs. The waiters are all very polite and helpful. They found us a seat up stairs in no time at all. I ordered a starter as I wasnt that hungry of carpaccio. There was a fair bit of meat which was a pleasant surprise. My friend ordered tagliatelle which was yummy and again a fair size portion.We both had ice cream for dessert and it was one of the best ice creams I have ever had. All round a great experience!!",

    "text": "Quite the lovely Italian restaurant located in Notting Hill. I came here with a friend based on his recommendation. We arrived on a weeknight around 8PM and the restaurant was completely full. Luckily we made reservations and got a nice little table for two downstairs.So... the bread. Holy crap, it's absolutely amazing. I had to restrain myself from eating too much. My friend even asked for a second basket. Slightly toasted on the outside with a soft middle. Dip those babies in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and you've got yourself a appetizing treat, as well as a fully blown carbo loaded meal. I ordered the Tagliolini con Gamberetti, Zucchine, Prosciutto Crudo e Pachino (Hand-made Tagliolini with Shrimps, Courgettes ,Parma ham and cherry tomatoes) and loved it. I hate to admit it, but I ate the entire thing in one sitting. *sigh*Kudos to my friend for a picking a superb Italian restaurant! Great food, wonderful atmosphere, and bread that is to die for!",

    "text": "Being Italian, I try to avoid Italian restaurants here as most of them are just plain terrible, so when some friends invited me there I was a bit skeptical but went anyways, and thank god I did! This place and their dishes remind me of home, of the things my grandma used to cook! Everything is delicious and they have a great wine selection too (and the staff is actually italian!) it's not as cheap as in Italy but not expensive either, considering the location and quality. Our table was upstairs but when I went downstairs to go to the toilet I noticed that the lower floor was rather noisy. So be aware of that when booking.",

    "text": "Oh baby. You have to come here for the smoked mozzarella on a bed of mushrooms in tomato sauce and prosciutto. Just think about that for a moment. Yeah. Come back and finish the rest of this review in a minute. Just come to this restaurant, order this, and don't worry, whenever the grim reaper comes for you, you'll die happy. And you'll float away on a ball of melty, stretchy, smoky cheese. As for what to get after your mozzarella? Well... For the gluten-eater in my life, it's always house-made pasta with an indulgent sauce, which changes with the season and the mood of the chef. I've also had some great anti pasti of the vegetable sort. After you've stuffed yourself on mozzarella, something light like grilled squid can be a welcome idea.Just be sure you call well ahead of time. This place is a destination as well as a local favourite. If you try to show up on a Friday at 8 PM, you'll have to go to one of the copy-cat places nearby. Which is not the end of the world.Gluten-free notes: No problems here. This place is run by Italians and they know what to do. After the cheese-ball of happiness, you can try risotto, grilled fish, or steak. Your life is good.",
