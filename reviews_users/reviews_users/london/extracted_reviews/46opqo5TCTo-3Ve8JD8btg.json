    "text": "This is a favourite place to go after a work Friday night out for the following reasons:(a) it is on our way home(b) it is inexpensive + quick, and(c) because of the juicy, greasy cheeseburgersIt makes no pretence of anything other than a quick stop for a burger after a night out (it is called Dirty Burger after all) but it beats every awful fried chicken, kebab, or fast food place hands down. I prefer the burgers in some other establishments (Five Guys comes to mind) and the fries are \"ok\", probably preventing a 5-star review, but I've never been anything other than immensely satisfied after wolfing down a Dirty cheeseburger at 5-past-late-o'clock. Good consistency of juicy beef, melted cheese, mayo and other toppings.It is a small establishment with some bar-style seating, given the fact it is under a railway arch at Vauxhall station, but it is never too busy for a seat when I've been in the (very) late evenings. There's a sort of \"industrial, run-down metal shack\" vibe going on, which actually I love, it is different from most places and fits in with its rail-based location.The menu is basic, don't come expecting a huge variety of exotic burger toppings - but they do serve bottles of beer if you're still in the drinking mood. You'll wait around 5 mins for them to cook the burger, but they cook it right in front of you, so you can't get much fresher! You'll probably eat it in less time than it took to make, but that may say less about the size of your meal and more about your hunger levels; amplified by the delicious smells of cooking beef circling around this little quick food stop.",

Weeks or even months gone by until I finally managed to get down to their new Vauxhall shop. Located in a railway arch, they tried to keep up their burger shack theme. It is not quite as quirky and industrial as the original shop in Kentish Town, but I think the Vauxhall outpost is a pretty decent effort.As you'd expect when you have been to their first shop before, you are in for a decent burger. When you crave a burger and are in the area, make sure you check out Dirty Burger - it's one of my favourite burgers in London along with the crinkle cut chips.",

In fact, we almost went to Nando's just because we needed to use the restroom, but opted to try the burgers instead. Cheap and delicious. I'm American, and while I appreciate a posh burger from time to time, these tasted like home. Juicy and with the pickles and the buns and just perfect happiness all over. If you're in the area, it's easy enough to stop in and pick up a burger and chips (which are also good). The previous reviewer said the burger was \"well cooked,\" but I like mine a little more pink in the middle and it didn't disappoint. It's probably cooked medium, but it's still perfectly juicy and just so delicious. I'm really making myself hungry writing this review.",

Yeah...I wanted to write a colorful culinary review of this burger joint but I didn't want to put readers to sleep before I officially recommend Dirty Burger. If you are in London near Embankment or Vauxhall or Lambeth or at the MI6 headquarters, get your arse down to Dirty Burger and bite into the meaty cheesy greatness and enjoy the glorious french fries (frites) and the surprisingly savory donuts. DB is also hangover worthy as they stay open pretty late.As for the burgers, Dirty Burger encases the patties in exact proportion to the bun such that the bun is not violating the meat and toppings it's holding. I never appreciate things like that until I get a bun that dwarfs the meat. I don't know if they use local grass-fed cows, Angus, moose, Spanish Toros or whatever and I don't live in London so I really didn't care. But where ever the beef originated, god bless that place! Don't forget to top your burger! Onions are a must, cheese is a must and bacon is a must. You can't be calorie counting at DB. Attack those calories! Show 'em you ain't scared!The place is small but it serves the purpose. Decent background music and clean facility. Don't remember a toilet being there.Prices are great. A good meal for less than \u00a39.Staff is efficient and courteous.5***** no doubt!",

I had an opportunity to visit for a late lunch and I capitalized.It is a simple place with a counter and not much seating. There are only three burgers on the menu, but there is no need for huge variety if you have mastered what you make. I got the Dirty Bacon. I wanted an Oreo milkshake, but they had only chocolate and strawberry available when I visited.The burger was ready in about five minutes. It came wrapped up, so I pressed it down a bit to get it down to mouth size before I ate it. It was nice and warm and I could see the juices ooze out a bit.I unwrapped the burger and it was indeed a beauty. The sauce was dripping out and making the bun soggy, but I was eating the burger quickly enough for this not to matter. They cooked the meat patty to medium which is just how I enjoy it. As for the bacon, it would be appropriate to call it a slab rather than a slice. What a nice surprise! But best of all was the grilled cheese. This made the burger for mine; much better than just including a slice of cheese.The burger was delicious with every mouthful as good as the last. I even found a bit of the grilled cheese in my wrapper after I finished, so I got to have one last extra taste of cheese. Happiness washed over me.The restaurant is literally around the corner from the Vauxhill station and there are signs to help you find it. It has late opening hours in the weekends, so it is convenient when you crave Dirty Burger after hours. Five stars all day long. I strongly encourage you to try it for yourself.",

Why not try the Church of Dirty Burger? Once you have tasted a Dirty Burger you will be filled with a new found understanding that you are closer to heaven while eating one than while eating any other burger and you will become consumed with a propensity to tell everyone else you meet. You will probably find yourself going door to door in your local neighbourhood trying to educate non believers to the joys of Dirty Burger and attending major sporting events so you can hold up placards. People won't take you seriously and will wonder how you can be so fanatical and obsessive over a burger, but that's because they haven't seen the light and it is your duty to save them. On the other hand if you aren't the religious type, or you are happy with your existing religion you are probably still going to love Dirty Burger. The burgers almost certainly contain more calories than the sun but the indulgence is totally worth it, the onion fries are great too. You won't regret getting down and dirty.",

It was pretty good, pretty much on the same level as other hipster-and-other-wannabes burger joints though with different toppings. This had pickles that blended very well with the flavour. The meat was of similar quality and well seasoned. I passively accepted the generosity on the pepper as it created a bold but rounded aftertaste. I liked the fact this was cooked very well, I don't really like red burgers. It might be a trendy joint but there's a lot of chippy feel to it.The chips were superb. Again, chippy-style but well cooked and with a perfect crunch.The onion rings were just as good with interesting, fluffy batter that stuck to the onion, albeit getting a bit soggy after a while.I'll come to this place again and again and again.",

    "text": "To say that I love Dirty Burger would be a massive understatement. Greasy burgers, salty fries, and excellent milkshakes made to order... it's heaven in your mouth. My only fear is that I always stop by Dirty Burger when I'm famished, after playing an hour of five a side football. Is it possible my hunger for just about anything has skewed my view of how good Dirty Burger actually is? I hope not, but I rarely find myself in Vauxhall to figure it out. Don't go to Dirty Burger expecting a fancy establishment. I mean come on, it's all in the name. The burger you get won't actually be dirty, but it's not called \"Fancy Burger\" for a reason. You need to eat the burger as soon as you get it, otherwise it'll practically fall apart or get soggy. That's just the nature of the beast, not much you can do about it other than enjoy it!Don't go here on a date. Go with your best friend, your long-term partner that you don't have to impress, or just by yourself when you need something quick (and dirty!).",

The burgers are delicious and I always have the cheese burger. Sometime I even double up on the meat if I am extra hungry. Service is brief but efficient but this isn't a place that you come and hang out for too long. You order, get your food, saddle up in a seat, eat and watch the passing vauxhall gyratory traffic go by and enjoy the food. I've had the cheese burger and its fresh to order so you will wait about five minutes. It's worth it. Also had the onion rings which are also fresh and not cooked from frozen. The batter is rich so if you are intent on finishing your burger, don't overdo the onion rings. Lastly I've had the crinkle cut fries. These are also good and are a novelty in a world of chips and straight fries. However they are also the reason for only a four star rating. The fries are good, tasty and a novelty but for the cost a bit steep. That is my only complaint. Two thumbs up otherwise for this place. Give it a go...and no, the burgers aren't dirty.",

Absolutely. Classic short-order cooking at its best. The menu is small which allows Dirty Burger to be fast & consistent. The grill is right behind the counter so you can watch your order being prepared while you wait. The crinkle cut fries aren't my favorite variety, but they're ok.

But I'd rather go to one of the little greasy spoons within 3 minute's walk, or Brunswick House.After 11am burgers are swiftly served up, ready to be scoffed down with fries (over-salted) and a freshly made shake, OJ or beer.One word review: sloppy.",
