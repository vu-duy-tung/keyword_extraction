We planned on meeting here at 12, when it opens, but they didn't open doors until 12:18... which worked out for me because I was running late anyway ;) And my friend was first in line, so whoopee! We got an idli, a hopper, a dosa, and a kari and that was enough to fill us! The dishes are quite nicely presented and the flavours were diverse and delicious -- note, the green bean in the idli is not really edible (quite fibre-ey)! Good service that gave good recommendations. Not a huge menu, but then again it's not overwhelming either.",

Bear in mind it is an extremely popular restaurant right now, you would be expecting to wait over an hour in weekends to have a meal that would mostly likely last only an hour as the food comes really quick (All of our dishes came within 10 mins). It is also a no booking restaurant so my advice is come early in mid weeks.",

A perfect meal if you need a power protein bite on the go! Filling enough, fairly guilt free, and reasonably priced. Fresh ingredients, clean place, friendly service, good atmosphere and music. On my list to go back to and try more dishes. Well done Hoppers!",

My friend had the egg hopper with chutneys and duck kari. The cashew kari was tasty and mild, and the duck kari was a little bit spicy. I was skeptical that a single hopper would fill me up - I never stop at just one at home - but by the end of the meal I was food-coma full (for under \u00a310). I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu.The only con for me was that seating is sharing style, so you might end up with a stranger occasionally elbowing you while you eat.",

We had the mutton roll to start with some devilled shrimp which was very hot. \u00a0We then had a pork Kari with a dosa and egg hopper with a nice range of side sauces. \u00a0This was amazing and my favourite part. \u00a0Furthermore when the bill came I felt it was a bargain for the quality and quantity of food we had, coming in under \u00a335 for two. \u00a0This place has a cult following and you can imagine other branches opening soon but highly recommended!

Luckily we were in the number for first sitting.The place is reasonably sized (approx 30ish) and its not too cramped with seating, decor is as you'd expect... Sri Lankan!! With matching music playing in the background. There's a selection of food, with small bites, Sri Lankan delicacies (Dosa / hoppers) and mains to he drinks menu was also pretty impressive . We had a selection from the menu... Roti, Bone marrow, devilled prawns, fish curry dosa and buffalo biryanis. None of it was bad, in fact the sauces for everything were pretty tasty. Compared to your standard curry house I'd say this place stands out, however compared to higher end \"sub continent \" (Indian, Bangladesh, Pakistani) restaurants it doesn't shine. The end bill which included a few lion beers ( which I actually quite liked!) came to \u00a325 between 3, and that was reasonable.A good place to try, maybe after the hype has died down but not unique enough a cuisine for me to make it a regular place.",

Mmm iron! Also ordered the Egg Hopper (pancake made of coconut and rice flour) and a Spicy Dosa, with sides of chicken curry and pork curry and chutneys. Both curries were flavorful and delicious.

We started with the mutton rolls, which look like they came from the supermarket, but taste great (and spicy!). Our other starter was the goat roti, which was a little bland. The table next to us raved about their duck heart so maybe we'll try that next time. For mains we shared a black pork kari (curry) with a podi (spicy) dosa and an egg hopper. The kari dishes are small but dense. You could do one each if you're big eaters. The dosa and hopper are a bit duplicative, both pancakes. The trick is to mix the curry with an egg hopper (total winner) and not bother with the side sauces. Minus one star because nothing blew me away and the whole no reservations thing..but it is really good value. The above was \u00a328 inc service.",

The staff were really helpful in giving advice on the menu. I ended up going for a hopper, a dosa and a chicken kari. The kari was really good, fairly spicy and perfect to dip the hopper and dosa into. Probably both a hopper and dosa is too much for one but I wanted to try both! I will definitely be back as there's lots more I want to try!",

I've eaten at Barrafina, Nopi, etc. and this was by far the best.Food: You have to get the bone marrow dish. In addition, get extra roti - it was delicious! Everything else was yummy, but that is the one dish you cannot miss! Definitely get there early - I got there around 5:25 pm and just stood in line. Immediately got seated.",

The meats were very tasty & tender. \u00a0It was the first time to have a Hopper which was good. Service was excellent as well. \u00a0 We enjoyed our meal & \u00a0would go back again.",

    "text": "I have to say this was one of my best meals in London to date. \u00a0So good I was finally sparked off my bum to write a review after many years in the dark.They don't take reservations so get here early - luckily they do a virtual line - so they call you when your table is available, so just head elsewhere to enjoy some drinks while you wait.There were five of us - tightly packed into a small table, but there was enough room for us to move and eat comfortably.For drinks I had both the Quart of Milk Panch (shared), which surprisingly wasn't overly coy or milky - I'm assuming because it is cardamom \"milk\" and not milk from an animal and the Wonder Tonic, which was pretty juicy and sweet. \u00a0But not in the best way. \u00a0This is the only area I felt that the menu fell a little flat for me. \u00a0The drinks were small - which is fine for the price point as long as they are strong - which they weren't. \u00a0Next time I'm sticking to wine or beer.Now for food:\"Short Eats\"- Lotus Root, Cashew & Ash Plaintain Fry - these were literally crisps made out of these various tubular plants and they were delicious, and came with a dipping sauce that carried a real kick. Would order again.- Goat Roti, Rasa - I enjoyed this (because I thoroughly enjoyed their roti), but it was simile and not overly flavourful when compared to the other dishes. But it got mixed reception from our group. I would order again, don't know if anyone else would.- Idli, Sambhar, Podi - I only had a bite, and I wasn't that taken back. \u00a0It was tasty, but almost like a very fluffy pancake in sauce. \u00a0I wasn't going back for seconds. \u00a0However, one of the others of our group (vegetarian) love it, so an option for people only eating veg.- Calamari Fry, Chemmeen Podi - the calamari was small, so maintained its crispy crunchiness. The sauce accompaniment provided a nice flavour. \u00a0Would order gain. \"Sides\"- Roti - I'm used to north indian roti, which is quite \"whole mealy\" This roti was completely different. \u00a0Almost like puff pastry roti. \u00a0Light and delicious. Would order again. (In fact we ordered seconds)\"Hoppers + Dosas\"- Egg Hopper - here is another item we ordered two rounds off. \u00a0This is like a thin crispy pancake in the shape of a bowl with a fried egg at the bottom. \u00a0The first was fully cooked the second was runny - and they were both delicious. \u00a0The pancake part is great for eating with kari, the egg tasted amazing on its own or with a selection of chutney's we got.- Dosa - Thin crispy, everything you want in a dosa. \u00a0I find these great accompaniments to karis again as they aren't as heavy as rice or naans, which means you can have more bites!\"Karis\"- Red Pumpkin Kari - good vegetarian choice. \u00a0While this was yummy and I would suggest again, it wasn't my favourite kari. \u00a0Less flavourful than other options, but would probably order again.- Fish Kari - this was made with salmon in a red sauce, and it was amazing. \u00a0Fish, not fishy, flaky delicious. The Kari sauce was flavourful with a kick (most of the food has at least a little kick), enough that we were sopping up every last bite. Even my friend who doesn't like salmon loved it.- Chicken Kari - this was ordered as round two as we liked the other two karis so much. \u00a0it wasn't nearly as good as either the pumpkin or fish kari. \u00a0Served in a spicy green sauce. Chicken was cooked well - moist and tender, just not my style.\"Rice, Roast & Kothu\"I saved the best for last- Lam kothu roti - We ordered the lamb kothu roti as it came recommended and we wanted to order something lamb. \u00a0This is chock full of veg and kothu roti - which is roti chopped up and stir fried in with the veg and meat. \u00a0This was AMAZING. Flavourful, spicy, perfect balance of oil to keep it moist without feeling oily. I mean this was amazing. \u00a0We ate it all in less than 5 minutes. \u00a0So good we had to order round two...- Vegetable kothu - AMAZING. Felt healthy but still very flavourful. I think this has no eggs so also veg friendly. \u00a0Spicy and tasty. I'm struggling to explain the flavours in these dishes because I literally have never tasted anything \u00a0like this before.Everyone at the table left full, but not in pain, and happy and wanting to go back for more!I will definitely be back to this place, cannot recommend highly enough. :)",

    "text": "Sri Lankan food is harder to come by in California, so I really wanted to try this place. It seems like it would be kind of hip, but the food was still authentic. \u00a0Many of the words on the Sri Lankan menu are more foreign to me, so it's nice that they have a glossary. \u00a0We did everything family style.Drinks:- Wonder tonic: tropical, a bit too sweet for me; rum based- Sambol garita: basically like a margarita with some extra kick - Arrack attack: the favorite drink for both of us - the ginger beer adds just the right amount of heatFood:- Brinjal moju: \"pickled\" eggplant; it actually wasn't sour. The eggplant had tons of flavor, and it was sweet and garlicky. The texture was interesting, too. It's definitely worth a try (it's a small cup)- Egg hopper: a coconut batter basket (sort of like a dosa shaped into a basket) with a runny egg in the center. I prefer the outer edge's texture since it's thinner and crisper. \u00a0The egg's seasoning was very good, but the rest of it was better with chutney and curry- Dosa: wonderful flavor, nice and thin; it left us wanting to order another one - Chutneys: ordered on the side - orange, green, and white (tomato based, herb based, nut based)- Red pumpkin kari: a red curry that's awesome for dipping the dosa and hopper - Ceylonese spit chicken: a small roast chicken with amazing flavor. The herb crust and the skin are super flavorful, and even the white meat had flavor in itself. It was a great roast chicken, which could definitely rival the Zuni one in SF. \u00a0It come with pol roti (thick pancake), but I preferred the dosa. \u00a0It also had a sambol that was like a red curry, which was great for dipping thingsI was very happy with this meal. The food was interesting, and all the flavors were really well balanced. Prices are also reasonable.It's a pretty small space with no reservations, so plan ahead. \u00a0We came around 10pm on a Friday night (close to closing), and the wait was under 10 min. \u00a0I would definitely come back.",

No review will do it justice so here are just a few tips for you.Tip: - you cant book a table, it's first come first serve and you have to wait until all your fellow dinners are there before they seat you. I went with a couple of friends earlier this week and they had a nerve racking experience waiting for me as the tables slowly filled up. Tip2: - don't worry if you don't know what to order/have never been there because:-A) \u00a0everything is amazingB) there is a glossary under the drinks menu letting you know what each of the common food phrases mean. C) the staff are amazing at giving you helpful advice (including why you may not like something) Tip3:- Be prepared to share. It is a fingers using kinda meal. There is cutlery but in the end you leave them to the side and are delving in with both hands. That's it - go and discover it yourself",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed Hoppers. I've been to quite a few Sri Lankan establishments before and I'd heard a lot about this one so was intrigued and excited to try it!I had done my research beforehand on Yelp and saw that a lot of people had said to get there for when it opens as you have to queue. So my partner and I got to the restaurant for around 17:25 and we were able to be seated straightaway!We ordered Devilled Shrimp and Mutton Rolls to start. Having had these dishes before, I was excited about trying them. They were both nice, however I've had better mutton rolls as these were not as spicy or as crispy. For mains we ordered the Black Pork Kari, Dosa and a Hopper. The Dosa was probably one of the BEST dosa's I've ever tasted! I genuinely loved it! The hopper was good as well, different to what I expected but good. They both came with a selection of sauces, one was a coconut chutney, the other a type of Sambal and then some coriander/green chutney. The pork was fantastic - it was extremely tender and not fatty and was spiced very well. I also ordered a beetroot, mango and grapefruit juice with my meal, whilst my partner ordered a Sri Lankan coffee. They forgot to give us the coffee though and we had to remind the waitress who gave it to us at the end. Which in a way was better as it was quite sweet and a nice way to end the meal.The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because I have issues with unisex toilets. Very pedantic of me, I know but hey, my issue I suppose!If you want to come for a reasonably priced meal (all of the above came to around \u00a330), a tasty meal and something a bit different,then definitely try it! Its literally a few doors down from Ronnie Scott's on Frith Street, off of Old Compton Street so its easy to find! One of Soho's gems methinks! :-)",

But it's not a big deal because they text you when your table is ready so we wandered off for pre-dinner drinks which were easy to find. It took a bit of time to navigate the menu and I had to assist the non south asians at the table. We all ended up with Karis and Hoppers or dosas and chutneys on the side. The plats are just beautiful and the food was really flavourful and delicious. The chutneys were fresh and each was very different. The restaurant itself is small and cosy with really charming decor. The music they played throughout the night was fun and we felt transported into a wonderful space. My big complain with the food was just how spicy it all was. We were all suffering a bit the next day but we agreed it was worth it. Not sure if we'll be back soon (our stomachs need rest) but I would recommend the place!",

    "text": "I love the growth of London, the demand for more 'authentic' cuisines, beyond the dishes altered for the Western palate like sweet and sour but more for new exciting and exotic flavours.This is how Hoppers became to be so successful, introducing Sri Lankan food you won't be able to find in your local curry house.The restaurant itself has been transformed to bring out the Sri Lankan theme with its reds and dim lighting, patterned wall tiles and carpet. It's a very casual place, shared bench seating and busy atmosphere. With its new, on the door booking system you now don't have to worry about queuing up. Just show up, leave your details at the door and come back when they notify you that your table is ready.Being very excited and eager we ordered the following:Bone marrow varuval, rotiDelicious thick fatty goodness of bone marrow in a mild thick masala curry. The sauce was generous and creamy with complex savoury flavours. It went down so well we tried to mopped it up using the accompanied roti which itself was amazingly light, buttery and doughy.Chicken heart chukka. Similar to calamari it had a lovely bounce to its texture, cooked with a more dry curry paste. It definitely had a lot more punch to it that leaves your tongue numbing in its spice. But truly delicious. Duck roti. Not as great as everyone shouts it out to be being quite dense and dry for my liking. The roti was baked till crisp and duck dry fried with complex flavours. It was quite spicy and exaggerated more so when dipped into the nutty spicier curry that it came with. String hopperKind of forgettable if you ask me as it was literally just a plate of rice noodles. Unless you had a lot of sauce left in your dish to use to mop it up with, it took a lot of flavours away. We may have ordered more sides than karis itself so maybe that was the problem. It was served with spiced desiccated coconut and a milky spicy coconut based dip that were delicious within itself but wasn't enough to make enough impact on the noodles.Podi dosaUnlike the plain dosa, this one comes with a dry spicy powder mix surrounding the inside. It's made of fermented lentils and rice. Kind of wish I ordered a plain one as my mouth was on fire at this point. But still I enjoyed tearing it apart , crackling as I did and somewhat flexible enough for me to turn it into a scoop to eat the karis with it.Egg hopper The infamous hopper itself made of fermented rice batter and coconut milk, somewhat like a thin crispy pancake made into a bowl shape. It had a hint of sourness to it but with a runny fried egg placed on top of it, the rich yolk overtook the flavour. It was a great perfect way to scoop some karis into it and let it soak it before eating it.Guinea fowl kariThe Guinea fowl was practically falling of the bone as soon as we dug in. You can imagine how tender the meat must have been. The curry itself was creamy, mildly spiced with a nice sweetness to it to counteract the heat. Black pork Kari A drier curry of chunky pieces of pork belly cooked in a sticky spicy sauce. The heat was more intense in this dish but it didn't stop me from eating it all up and enjoying the intensity of the juicy tender pork pieces in the lovely spicy flavours.Lamb KothuThe dish I would come back over and over again for. Marinated tender pieces of lamb, thrown in with spices, a lovely ray of vegetables, eggs and small pieces of roti soaking up all the lovely flavours. The combination of textures and flavours were amazing especially with the addition of the egg binding bits and pieces of everything together.Watallapan A spiced coconut custard based pudding, firm at first and then from squidgy to a thick paste as it melts in your mouth. You can taste the notes of cardamom and cloves against the sweetness and of course the nuttiness from the topping of crushed nuts. I wasn't too sure if the texture was satisfying enough for me. It wasn't exactly creamy or smooth but somewhere in between. Still I'm very glad I got to try something new. Durian ice cream They ran out of the milk hopper with treacle, jaggery but was kind enough to just charge us for the durian ice cream it usually comes with. Now Ren who usually runs away at the sight of durian enjoyed this as the coldness of it managed to hide the so called 'horrible smell' (which I personally think smells delicious). This allows you to explore the unusual sweetness of the fruit. Durian is essentially a creamy fruit so being made into icecream really exaggerates this further making it somewhat more acceptable for first time eaters.Even in such a busy kitchen, food came quick. It comes when it's ready and in no particular order so be prepared for that. Service was great throughout, helping us suggest and explain dishes. We were so comfortable we wished we were able to sit longer but we saw people waiting outside and felt bad and asked for the bill. Hopefully they will open another branch soon!",

Bone marrow varuval. Egg hopper with black pork kari. Complex spicing with good kick of heatHighly recommended",

Since Hawksmoor opened over 10 years ago I haven't found a place that I'm so enamoured with.Food is Sri Lankan/South Indian. It is very aggressively spiced, and resultantly both full of flavour and often wonderfully hot. Try to order widely, because it's all good. Menu seems to change frequently, but I've really enjoyed both the bone marrow and duck hearts recently.Atmosphere is very buzzy (it's ALWAYS full), but nicely so - you can hear yourself speak. Beautifully decorated without being contrived. Very cosy and comfortable.Staff are consistently lovely and competent.",

    "text": "I got off work early one day and took advantage of the opportunity to try and queue for an early dinner at one of London's hottest no reservation restaurants. I was deciding between Bao and Hoppers, and my friend opted for the latter so we showed up at 5:15 PM, 15 minutes before opening, and there was already a 10 person queue. The restaurant is a cozy little place, seating probably only about 30 people, and as we were a group of 2, we were seated at a sharing table in the middle of the restaurant. I thought it was actually a great way to keep table turning and make the most of the small space. If you arrive after all the seats have been filled... tough luck, although they seem to have a system where they can take your phone number and let you know when the table is ready.The good thing is that the menu is relatively simple and you receive your food very quickly (pretty sure almost everything is pre prepared). We were guided by a cheery and efficient waitress who suggested that we get a few of the \"short eats,\" two karis (curries), and a hopper and a dosa. She did, however, fail to warn us that the bone marrow and hot butter devilled shrimp we ordered were dangerously spicy, to the extent that it definitely hampered my enjoyment of the food. The curries went much better, and we liked that the black pork kari and the fish kari are very different in character (there are no descriptions on the menu). The hopper was more spongy, whereas the dosa was crisp and flaky, so we thought the hopper went better with the sauce in the fish kari, whereas the dosa was better for the spiced but not sauce based black pork kari. Both were delicious.As for drinks, they are well known for their cocktails and my friend got the Kung Fu Pandan in a short old fashioned glass, before moving onto one of their lagers, which don't come cheap at \u00a34.50. \u00a0They only have wine in a glass or half bottle size, so I got one of the red wines, which only did a moderate job of washing away the extreme spiciness I encountered. Overall I think Hoppers is a unique concept and that is probably why is has done so well in the London restaurant scene. That said, it's not a cuisine I crave all that often so it might be a while before I come again!",

As for the legendary queues, we got there Saturday around 4:30pm and waited for maybe 10 minutes before we were called in.As for the food: I got the string hoppers with the accompanying sauces, the proper hopper with the coriander, coconut and tomato chutneys and the pol roti (grilled coconut roti) with gourd and cashew kari. The second hopper in particular is quite large and satisfying, with the coconut flavour quite mild, and the coriander chutney is the perfect accompaniment. The kari is a small portion with the cashew flavour really standing out. The roti though was a a bit bland. I'm dinging a star just bc the service was OK; our waiter forgot about our waters and we had to flag down another waitress. Ditto with the check.",

The Sri Lanka restaurant opened just last October and already managed to become a place were you will have to wait for at least two hours before getting a table. The dishes are not quite genuinely \u00a0Sri Lankan but they are a delicious alternation. The restaurant offers a few cocktails made from Arack, Sri Lanka' s national alcoholic drink. If you can take alcohol, it might be good to try Arack straight. The drinks were good but fairly pricey given that they are in a small glass. The food was superb. Make sure to try the bone marrow which is in a curry sauce and is delicious.",

Try the curry leave buttermilk as a starter or to accompany your spicy dishes! The idli was funny and spicy, Dosas or Hoppers are a must have. They come with many chutneys and get a Kari! Can recommend the red pumpkin. Still all these dishes are kind of small and feed on the light side... But you will get truly funky tastes and occasionally cry of spicyness:) Prepare to spend above or just about 20,- at least.",

We sat on the table that overlooked the street, a perfect little place to see Soho and it's vibrant people go about their day. First up was the idli, a delightful sponge rice cake of sorts. The egg hopper should be ordered for both novelty and taste purposes. It was an extremely interesting dish that paired very well with the vegetable root Kari. The pol roti to finish was perhaps not up to scratch when compared to the first two. Nonetheless, a great insight into interesting food",

    "text": "Recently I went to the new bloggers & critics acclaimed restaurant: Hoppers. Hoppers is a Sri Lankan restaurant owned by\u00a0Karam, Jyotin and\u00a0Sunna\u00a0Sethi, the team behind Trishna and Gymkhana, and based on Frith street. When I heard it was\u00a0related to Gymkhana, I must say that turned me off a little bit as I had an awful experience there due to bad service.I've tried to go to Hoppers before Christmas but I did not really want to wait and have lunch at 4pm. This was before\u00a0they introduced their app\u00a0queuing system. I went to Hoppers last weekend and heard a lot of good things about their app queuing system,\u00a0unfortunately (or kind of) I didn't get the\u00a0chance to experiment \u00a0with it as I managed to get a table straight away.\u00a0My sister and I were not\u00a0familiar at all with Sri Lankan cuisine and dishes. As soon as we were seated, a very nice waiter explained to us the\u00a0concept and the menu. He recommended that we order a dosa or a hopper which is a\u00a0bowl-shaped thin pancake\u00a0made with fermented rice and coconut milk batter, with a\u00a0karis (equivalent of a curry).We asked for the mildest curry, and were recommend the red pumpkin kari and the lamb kari.We started our meal with two starters which are called 'short eats', we had the mutton rolls and the duck roti.\u00a0The mutton rolls were\u00a0nicely\u00a0crispy on the outside and had mild spiced rich mutton inside, and were served alongside a spicy tomato relish. The duck roti was a\u00a0minced and spiced duck meat roti pastry and it was served with a nutty spicy sauce. Both starters were delicious, however we had a preference for the mutton rolls but we ate them with the duck roti sauce.\u00a0My sister and I like spicy food but only when it is not too hot. We made the mistake of drinking all our water with our starters and our mouths started to burn soon after!A nice waiter seeing our\u00a0distress, asked us if we wanted some yoghurt to calm the heat. We accepted without hesitation and ordered a second bowl to compliment our mains too.\u00a0It was really nice to have such attentive waiters.\u00a0For mains, we had one hopper\u00a0each with a\u00a0soft-yolked egg baked into it, with\u00a0all the sauces: Poi Samboi,\u00a0Seeni Samboi and a\u00a0coriander chutney. We shared the lamb kari and the red pumpkin kari.\u00a0The lamb kari was very tender and melt in the mouth, but it\u00a0was indeed spicy. The pumpkin was probably the most mildest dish of our meal. It went very well with the lamb.\u00a0We didn't have any dessert as we were too full, but during my next visit I might try one.Overall, despite our mouths being on fire for the whole lunch, we had a very good experience at Hoppers.\u00a0The team was really nice and attentive, the food was superb, spicy and full of flavours.\u00a0I will\u00a0definitely come back to Hoppers if I don't have to queue for hours.In my opinion, the only\u00a0improvement this restaurant could do in the future will be to offer each dish with different level of spices so everyone can have more options.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants in London Soho that you must try especially if you are up for trendy food and never try Sri Lankan cuisine before! Definitely would go again!Hoppers has only a few dishes on its menu, but we were still spoilt for choice! There's also a helpful glossary at the back of the menu to explain what each dish is. Here's how we got on:Chicken Heart Chukka (\u00a34.50) - one of THE best ways we've eaten chicken hearts. Don't be put off by the sound of this dish - if you've never had chicken hearts before, now is the time to try! The chicken hearts were really tender and the coupled with the South Indian spices, it really was a good way to start our meal.Bonemarrow Varuval, Roti (\u00a34.50) - sweet, melt-in-your mouth bonemarrow, cooked in a delicious curry. The curry itself was really creamy from the coconut milk and it wasn't too spicy either. The only down side to this dish is that there wasn't enough of it! The accompanying roti was also good, crispy and fluffy and paired so well with the curry.Hopper (\u00a33.00) with Guinea Fowl Kari (\u00a35.50), accompanied by Pol Sambol, Seeni Sambol and Coriander Chutney (\u00a31.00) - the famous hopper is made with fermented batter and coconut milk. It's got a soft fluffy centre like a pancake, with the top half crispy like a crepe. The guinea fowl was so tender it was falling off the bone! Dosa (\u00a33.00) with Fish Kari (\u00a35.50), accompanied by Coriander, Tomato and Coconut Chutney (\u00a31.00) and Yogurt (\u00a31.25) - the dosa is like a super crispy crepe, but made with lentils. The fish was super moist and the spices in the curry didn't overpower the subtle flavour of it.Buffalo Buriyani, Duck Egg Kari, Yogurt and Brinjal Moju (\u00a316.00) - this dish is one of only three mains on the menu. Another faultless dish.Watallapam (\u00a34.00) - a steamed coconut pudding with a strong cardamom flavour. This is a dessert that just melts in your mouth. It's also a pretty small portion. Love cake with Yogurt Kulfi (\u00a34.00) - similar to a sticky toffee pudding, but with the extra flavour of cardomom (although not as strong as the Watallapam). On top you have a scoop of yogurt kulfi. We were really impressed with Hoppers and will definitely be back soon to try everything else on the menu.",

Late afternoon on Saturday it was about 40 minutes, and I have heard it is about 3 hours at other times, so don't go if you need to eat right away and I also wouldn't recommend it for groups as it's tiny.Of the food we tried, the goat roti really stood out with an outstanding rich flavour, we loved it. I had never tried hoppers before and tbh I am not the biggest dosa fan but it is really well done and the curry (kari) we had (black pork) was very good - obviously you don't often get a pork curry so this is well worth a try.The drinks were also surprisingly awesome - my Sri Lankan twist on a margarita was fantastic - pungent and well mixed - and my friends wattalapa milk was excellent as well - gorgeous flavours of spice and coconut.I'd definitely recommend this place and would like to come back to try more of the appealing menu.Only after reading Yee Gan's review did I click that this is where Koya used to be: RIP.",

Needless to say there were a number of folks waiting, as with many of the great restaurants in Soho. However, I was fortunate enough to grab a seat at their bar table \u00a0without having to wait at all (perks of a solo traveler?).I got the egg hopper, a bowl shaped thin crepe / pancake with an egg in the middle and a lamb curry. I also got a hot buttered deviled shrimp dish that was equally as delicious. To cut some of the heat I ordered the Wattalapan Milk, which was very tasty and much needed.This would be at the top of my list of favorite restaurants in London - really wish I could pluck this place up and drop it in my NYC neighborhood!",

They're already behind the likes of Trishna, Gymkhana, Bubbledogs and Bao in London - and now Hoppers, an ode to the eponymous Sri Lankan dish.They don't pull any punches on the flavours here and the whole experience was essentially a rave up for my tastebuds. The sambal, dosa and karis took me straight back to Sri Lanka (as did all the traditional decor touches), with a host of other new flavours too. There's plenty of veg choice but I'm afraid the best flavours are to be found among the meat dishes; the bone marrow varuval with delightfully flaky roti is not to be missed. I was also pleasantly surprised by the chicken heart dish, whilst the whole Ceylonese spit chicken arrives with a flourish and is covered in a spicy, finger-lickingly moreish coating.It's the kind of meal you need you get stuck in with your fingers, and it's an adventurous menu with plenty of unfamiliar dishes - both important reasons to choose your dining companions carefully! I think a group of 4 is optimal - enough to order a load of dishes to share (and you'll want to try plenty) but not enough to wait an age to get seated. If you can get there for 5.30pm opening so much the better but otherwise there'll be queues (though they use qudini so you can easily pop for a drink nearby). We were such keen beans we were actually first in! Thanks to Karan and his team for taking such good care of us - the staff are all up to speed on the more esoteric ingredients. Your adventurous eating will be rewarded by good value for money too - I was surprised when the amount of food we ate came to less than \u00a320 a head. I think my eyes were bigger then my stomach though, resulting in me waddling home and still feeling full the next morning!",

I'm completely in love with Hoppers and can see myself trudging over quite often, inspite of having had to wait an hour to get our table.Hoppers has been on my wishlist for ages and I was determined to eat there this weekend. Inspite of Murphy's Law acting out in full force, I dragged myself out of the house and headed there. Only to be told at 9:30, that there would be at least an hours wait for a table AND the kitchen closed at 10:45pmAnyway, we asked her to put our names down on the list. We were given the link to a really neat app, which would let us know when it was our turn (however, mobile signal is terrible on Frith street) and we headed to Bar Italia for a coffee. Sadly, the desserts there were too tempting and by the time we returned we had only half our appetite left and not enough time.We did however get to try their signature bone marrow curry with the Ceylon paratha (layered and flaky). The egg appam with pork kari and the gun powder dosa with some SriLankan sambols. Everything was absolutely delish!Finally, I have found a place that can make thin crispy dosas in London, close to home (I can make the thicker versions myself, but you need an industrial style kitchen to get them thin and crispy)I'd love to go back with more people (its a tiny place, so table of 4 is the best bet) and try EVERY SINGLE THING on the menu. They have a full bar, serving a few brands that are only available in India / Sri Lanka - like the Amrut, I didnt see Old Monk though. They did have frothy milk coffee, but when I checked it was being served from a thermos, so I decided against it.This is a place I will visit often, until I taste everything on the menu and start over again.",

Fortunately living in London encourages to taste the New and challenge the Known - and following this philosophy I ended up in Hoppers.I was lucky to have queued for only a couple of minutes and when I ordered the food was with me very promptly. Bone Marrow Varuval - velvety bone marrow is packed with flavour and covered in spicy sauce. Definitely fascinating for palate accustomed to western food. Accompanied with Roti, a basic Sri Lankan flatbread (beautifully textured and delicious in its simplicity) which can be dipped in the sauce to compliment the smoothness of the bone marrow.Goat Roti - I must have been unclear with my ordering because this arrived as a surprise. After taking a bite I could not complain - delicious goat mince played really well against the Roti. This dish also featured a sauce which added even more character.Hopper with Sambols and Coriander Chutney - a bowl-shaped flatbread based on a fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk. Again - interesting on its own but coming with three dips completely different in character. Great Stuff.Overall I was really glad I gave Sri Lanka a shot. It really confirms that if you dislike any particular cuisine it might be that you just have to try a quality representation.",

Couple of must haves include the Short Rib Biryani and bone marrow appetizer, but really you can't order wrong. The only thing I would avoid is the chutneys, which are small sides that take away from the flavor and are overpriced-Helpful servers that will be honest when you have ordered too much and what you should try.-authentic drinks with Sri Lankan beers and cocktailsThe bad:-No reservations. I have been on a Tuesdays and each time the wait can be over 2 hours!! The way it works is that you need to show up in person to give your name, then you are put into a virtual queue. Why not just allow people to make reservations online?! It's a headache to come put your name in then wait around 2 hours to eat -Tight space. Although the ambiance is modern and clean feeling, they really cram you in here and spots on the bar can feel like you are constantly in wayBottom line: the food here outweighs any and all negatives about the ridiculous wait and tight space. Hoppers is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in London",

Mainly because the menu was incomprehensible. One side of the menu is actually a description of all the menu words. So it can take a long time to decide what to order. I'm not a fussy person so decided to go with the most bizarre worded dish I could find in the menu. And I have no clue what I ate, which I found quite funny but not everyone will like it.Definitvely not a place to go with fussy eaters.Coffee is amazing (careful it has a lot of sugar)",

I had heard so much about the place and but returned back thrice due to unavailability of a table. This place is always booked! Finally my fourth visit turned out to be brilliant one. Worth the wait!! We ordered almost everything in the menu. The crab curry is a must, must try. The food is spicy here and this is best part about this restaurant. Very friendly staff and they will guide you through the list really well. They do not do desserts, so even better to stuff your belly full with the main course \u00a0Advice: They do not take bookings. So if you really want a table, write your name at the door by 6 pm and when your table is ready, they will give you a call. GOOD LUCK!",

The lady at the door told us it would a THREE hour wait for tables of 3. We said we will put our names down and she was not happy. She was basically hinting we should go away because tables of 3s are not profitable, whereas tables of two or four may be easier to handle than odd numbers. She went to whisper to her coworker, her coworker said just tell them it will be after 10pm. Wait! But don't you close at 10pm!?? They took my phone number and said to follow link to see my place in position. We walked around, then after an hour, we checked the link to see we went from position 27 to position 8!!! We were very excited and surprised the queue went down so quickly. We went back and the same lady said checked her notes and said oh it will have to be after 10pm. I told her it does not take 2 hours to wait 8 position, she said there are still 6 tables of 3s before me. This just to show they are not seating odd number tables and does not respect first come first serve. I would prefer you telling me the truth than to led customers on to wait 3 hours when you don't plan to seat them. Been here before and enjoyed the food. But Just to say bad service, you lost me as your customer.",

The first visit here was very lucky. It was kind of rainy and we were seated straight away during a normal dinner time. Normally you have to wait for quite a while. Everything we ordered tasted amazing and I think what makes this place stand out from others is their incredible and very unique flavours. Their crab curry was unbelievable. It came in the shell which was a challenge but the sauce and seasoning was out of this world. We also had the egg hopper. It was totally different than anything I'd had before, and it was perfect for dipping in the curry. The vegetable kothu rothi was massive and had so many flavours and textures. All of the food tastes wonderful on its own, but even better when you eat it together. They also have a number of different sides and chutneys to try which are all very different but add their own special touch. My favourite was the beinjal moju- eggplant/aubergine in a killer seasoning. All in all, the food was filled with spices and flavours that I had never had before and made me wanting to come back and have everything again plus all the other things we didn't try. Their drinks were also good!",

We ordered the beef varuval/bone marrow to start along with an egg hopper + chicken kari on the side. The flavor of the bone marrow was incredibly rich and deep--definitely recommended! We loved it so much that we had to stop our kind waiters from clearing our dish multiple times (haha we wanted to make sure we got every last drop of the sauce). The egg hopper was also delightful with our kari and bone marrow. You can taste the rice + coconut in the batter, and the fluffy texture as you get closer to the boiled egg center was wonderful. The kari itself was also delicious; tender chicken, earthy and flavorful with a slight heat.The dishes looked to be on the smaller side when they first arrived at our table, but the amount of food ended up being perfect for us. In addition to the food, I appreciated the attentive service and lively atmosphere. The restaurant itself is quite small, but it makes for a cozy and lively space that isn't overwhelmingly loud. Overall a memorable experience that I would love to repeat the next time I visit London!",

Luckily there is a glossary on the menu although no photos so trust the Yelp app!I have not had one bad dish, just some that I prefer over others. Their hoppers or thin pancakes are fun and tasty when dipped in curry or your choice of chutney. There are many types to suit your spice level and preference. Our waitress helped to explain the dishes and asked if I preferred relish or sauce so the side dishes were suited to me.It's not a cheap place to eat unless you want a nibble and best to share dishes. The express lunch was nearly \u00a320 which is steep however you do get three small dishes along with a hopper or dosa and tea or coffee. I ended up sharing some of it because it was a lot. Okra curry, lamb koti and the veggie croquet was amazing. The sweet hot tea was also a nice treat.Recommend to come early unless you want to queue up for an hour during the dinner rush. Service is slow for lunch but better for dinner. Overall a fantastic taste of Sri Lanka.",

What's great is that they will text you when the table is ready so you can walk around. Our wait on a Saturday evening at 8:30 was about 1-1.5 hours. We ordered the egg hopper with a few sauces (sauces and rice are ordered separately) and lamb roti. Egg hopper was delicious! Beautifully presented, fresh, crispy on the outside while soft and tender on the other side. Lamb roti was also good! There were small pieces of roti with the lamb. A bit spicy and meat was tender. Portions are smaller - more tapa sized but still reasonably priced. The restaurant, food and locations provides for a lovely experience.",

The food, drinks, service (if you can get a table). It's really a one of a kind place. I constantly think about the incredible curry, roti, dosa, and cocktails I had when I visited. Here's what you need to know:1. The food is so flavorful. Are you tired of spiceless food? Well, Hoppers can cure you of that problem.2. Don't pass up the chance of have one of the gin cocktails. It will be delicious and incredible. Just try them all.3. The portion size is great. My friend and I had so much food leftover.4. The curry... just order it no matter what. It's amazing.5. Getting a table is a struggle. It's hit or miss.If you're looking for a good spot in Soho, I can't recommend Hoppers enough.

The restaurant is rather small and I was concerned we'd have trouble getting a table around prime dinner time, so we opted for lunch instead. We ordered half the entire menu, I swear. I've never had a hopper before and we said yes to getting it with an egg, and it was probably one of the best and most favorite dishes I've had in London to date. I have no idea how they do it, but everything about it works - the flavors, the textures, the sheer beauty of an egg fused perfectly into the bottom of the rounded-out hopper. It was definitely not a cheap lunch, so I probably frequent this place, but I left feeling both very full and satisfied. I'd recommend getting a bunch of small plates that you can split with your table so you can try as much as humanly possible. I would literally come back just for the egg/hopper.",

The service was good although the table were small and the resturant shuts down for a period of time between lunch and dinner so you do have a limited time for lunch. I look forward to visiting again. I can see the Soho branch now also offers picnic lunch boxes which would be perfect for the summer. So I will look to try this one day. Dress Code: No dress codeBooking Process: In the Soho branch you cannot book so its walk in only, being small this can be a bit hit and miss as it is a busy place and I prefer to book to be honest so I am not as comfortable with this process. Location: 49 Firth Street, Soho, London, W1D 4SGCuisine Type: Sri-LankenParking: Soho, so not really but there is an NCP car park not to far away. Advice you use the well connected London Transport system.Decor & Lighting: Basic decor, nothing special but still clean, tables are a bit small given the size of the dishes so bear this in mind when ordering. Heating and Cooling: It was a sunny day but everything inside was comfortable. Drinks: \u00a0Sunshine juice - Cold Press Orange Juice - Ginger - Turmeric - Honey - Given they do not do normal range of soft drinks i found this refreshing and ginger and turmeric was very subtle. I had the following food: Chicken Kari - A large portion with some great flavour in the curry to me it is like a mix between Thai and Indian.Egg Hopper - This is a light crispy pancake with an egg inside, similar to a south indian Dosa but a nice accompaniment. String Hopper - Another large portion and really light and great taste, it went really well with the chicken to be honest as a substitute to rice which can be a little heavy and filling. Mutton Buriani - Another really large portion and another great dish where the lamb was succulent. Plenty for two or more. Really fresh and one of the best I have eaten. Bill / Cost: \u00a380.00 for 2 (with enough food to take away for another night)Conclusion: \u00a0A great place to eat some great food. I would not order as much next time but with so many new items I have never tried I went a bit crazy.",

Particular highlights: string hoppers, bone marrow (the curry on this was WOW), chicken wings, and the egg hopper. Go for lunch right at opening to avoid a long wait. Fantastic drinks (non alcoholic) ad well. I'm gonna dream about this place when I go home to NYC.",

    "text": "After hearing great reviews of this place decided to check it out on a weekday evening around 07:30 and was told the wait is more than an hour and a half long. \u00a0They do not take reservations but when we arrived there we were given a queue number - decided not to wait then and went someplace else. Came back yesterday around 12:30 which I think was prefect timing as was seated immediately. I was sharing the table with few other customers and was seated on one side of the sofa but it did not feel cramped \u00a0- had plenty of space to put my stuff on a nearby chair. The decor inside was basic and simple.Met the owner \u00a0Karan - asked for his recommendations since was my first time here. Was very helpful - he asked my preferences etc. He explained the dishes in detail too. Decided to go with the egg hopper - it doesn't come with any chutneys or condiments and they have to be ordered separately. Was told the curries go well with it - The server recommended fish curry - I decided or try out the lamb curry. Curry and hopper combination was great - lamb curry had the perfect amount of spice level and was cooked to perfection. I also tried their peach and ginger drink which complemented the spiciness of the dish well. The service was good and food was served in just 10 minutesThey have quite a selection on their menu too. Good food - will definitely go back to try other dishes too.",

We ordered the beef short rib biryani, the stir fry roti, and a bone marrow dish. The biryani and the stir fry roti were extremely delicious and very flavorful, and they kept very well on our walk back home. It's among the best Southeast Asian places I've eaten at, and I'd definitely come back for a sit down meal.",

    "text": "I want to disclose up front why this is not a 5 star review. That has nothing to do with the food here which in itself is 5 stars. But it is the way they handle their seating. It is a very small restaurant, with a great ambience. However, all seating is cramped and you will find yourself sharing your table with others. Also they don't take reservations, and you will need to go to the restaurant well before you want to eat, just to put your name down. Then you can go for drinks. In our case, it took over 90 minutes to get a table even though we got there at 6p (on a Saturday). They could simply take paid reservations if they are so busy. Why make people wait around in the cold in busy Soho!On to the food. I tried the Chicken Lollipops, the Mutton roll, the Fish Kari, the Egg Hopper and the Podi Dossa along with a side of Idli. All items were very good but the stand out dishes for me were the Mutton Roll and the Fish Kari. I cannot recommend those enough. I looked over at the person next to me and he was having what looked like the Bone Marrow curry. It looks very good and I might return to try that. Overall, a good experience, which would have been great if I didn't have to wait around.",

For my drink, I ordered the pear and ginger beer. Everything was great.The biryani was well-spiced. A bit too much cardamom for my taste, but not their fault. The duck egg was quite unique and quite delicious. Imagine a Sri Lankan Scottish Egg, without the breading. The waiter kept insisting the dish was too much for one person, but I thought it was the perfect size. (I do tend to eat a lot though)",

Everything tasted only of red pepper and not much else. They brought us the wrong drink at first, and all of the cocktails tasted like bitter water. We will not return.",
