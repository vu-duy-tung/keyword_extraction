We wanted to have a girls catch up and dinner in central London, therefore we chose to be close to Leicester Square, and head to the cinema straight after dinner. My flat mate has chosen Chicken Alfredo, while I decided to order the new Steak Stone, a special steak that you can cook directly at your table. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and I felt like being Nigella for a night! Cooking my steak was a fun and quirky experience, loads of laughter involved. Clever idea, they give you a choice of flavoured butter and different sauces to dress your steak up. Prices absolutely reasonable and excellent choice of wines, venue decor and the central location are a big plus.",

The size of the steak and the presentation made a massive first impression. The steak came served as medium rare, but the unique thing about this meal is that you have the ability to cook the steak yourself using the hot stone which accompanies it. The taste of the steak was as good as i have ever tasted and even exceeded what i was expecting. The steak came with butter that added to the over all taste and experience of what i will remember as a perfect meal.",

    "text": "After a long day sipping ale in the sun and wandering along the South Bank we ended up in Leicester Square, hungry and in search of a substantial meal.After walking around the square we decided to settle for Steak & Co, on the corner of Charing Cross road.Having settled down outside (ah outdoor eating on a warm evening) we order a drink and started to browse the menu. My Captain Morgan & Coke came already coked and had a kick like a mule, they obviously were not shy with the Cap'n. \u00a0S_ had a diet coke which by all accounts was good and sugar free.I decided, as I was having a steak for main, to go for something lighter to start, and ended up selecting the mussels. What arrived was a paper bag in a dish, wrapped tightly, On opening the bad I found a decent portion of good sized mussels in a rich creamy garlic & onion sauce. The sauce was so good I ended up de-shelling all of the mussels into the sauce and eating it with a spoon like a soup.The mussels also came with 2 wet wipes and a spare bowl and napkins, the kind of touch so often missing. S_ had dipping skins, which was a good basket of crispy potato skins complete with garlic mayonnaise and jalape\u00f1o & sweet chilli dipping sauce. She was happy and we both chowed down, well pleased with the starter selection.When I ordered my 10 Oz Rib Eye, I was informed that it was served rare on a sizzling platter and I could complete the cooking to my liking. With the steak, you can order a seasoned salt, a butter and a sauce. The idea is that you season the steak when you get it, use the butter to fry off one piece at a time on the stone, and then use the sauce as a dip. I got the Chilli sea salt for seasoning, the garlic butter and the pepper sauce.Wow! When the steak arrived I promptly moved it form the stone to my plate, seasoned it with the salt, and then proceeded, piece by piece, to sear it on a small knob of garlic butter before diping it and popping each morsel in my mouth. The steak was juicy and tender, the sauce was good and tasted of black pepper, and the butter was obviously not tesco value brand. This method of eating a steak really works for me. The smell of the garlic butter sizzling and the steak searing before each mouthful really adds to the overall flavoursome sensation.With the steak I had a side of Fries and Onion rings, both excellent.S_ had a rack of ribs, which turned out to be \u00a01/2 a large pig. The ribs were wide and juicy, and as she commented, \"were not boiled\" (a big bug bear with her). It certainly looked and smelled great. Again plenty of wet wipes and additional napkins were provided for the ribs. As our watier commented, this is where things get messy.Although quite satisfied, we decided to go for broke and ordered dessert.Her Rocky Road was an interesting concoction. Although it contained all of the usual ingredients of a Rocky Road, they were in layers instead of all being jumbled into one slab. An interesting take on a classic sweet snack and quite tasty. I had the Chocolate Fondant, a nicely sized rich slightly cakey exterior hiding a quite decadent thick warm gooey chocolate sauce. It was accompanied by a scoop of home-made vanilla ice cream bursting with grains of vanilla.Service was excellent and non-intrusive throughout. The waiter, while being alert and communicative left us alone while eating. When my steak was served, he hovered over me as I put the first tiny knob of butter on the stone, and immediately judged that the stone was not hot enough and whipped it away to be replaced with a lump of lava that stayed sizzling until I had cooked off the last morsel.What else can I say? Steak & Co ticks all the boxes for me and I will be re-visiting the next time I pop over for a show or a visit.",

When we went it was a few days before Christmas and it was our goodbye meal before the holidays! We enjoyed a lovely meal - he had ribs and chips and I had scampi and chips - and had some lovely wine. The service was great too. I would recommend the place and would return, wonderful location too - stone's thrown from the Portrait Gallery, off Charing Cross Road, walking distance to Charing Cross Station, Piccadilly and Leicester Square tube stations and Theatreland.",

I felt it was great value for money for such an excellent steak with a free bottle of chardonnay with theatre ticket receipts-but to pay extra for the side dishes seems somewhat excessive. the surroundings and decor are immaculate, toilets pristine, and there is a pleasant atmosphere. but as others have noted the evening service is slow (i had to remind the waiter to bring the wine as he forgot) and although I ordered ketchup twice it never arrived. The waiting staff had a slightly carefree attitude versus apologetic..(hence a star drooped on my review) but despite that i would definitely return again and would like to be able to restore that star on another visit.",

The steak was served with salad and French fries. We also ordered salmon salad. Though it tasted a little salty, still a good meal. We were seated outside as the weather was perfect. The waiter was friendly and prices are reasonable.",

    "text": "My fellow Yelping girlfriend and I targeted Steak & Co for its supposedly great mac & cheese. I'M HERE TO WIPE \"SUPPOSEDLY\" FROM THAT SENTENCE.Before I get into that lemme just say that this is an amazing steak place, but THE SIDE DISHES. THE EFFING SIDE DISHES. I got a starter, the southern fried peppered chicken, and subsequently ordered three side dishes. BREAKDOWN TIME:Southern Fried Peppered Chicken Starter - Tastes like chicken tenders to me rather than fried chicken. Not that it's a bad thing at all, but after a few bites I got some ketchup to start dipping. So delicious. Friend fries - Thanks for calling these fries! I'm American so that hit home. The fries are presented in a cool way, it looks like a mini-frying basket. Perhaps they were in fact fried in that basket, but probably not. Refer to the pic I uploaded to see what I'm talking about.Caesar salad - I lovvvveee caesar salad so I got this for the hell of it and it was just as good as you'd expect a restaurant caesar to be.Mac and Cheese - OKAYYYYY HEREEEE WE GOOOO. I've been searching for the best mac and cheese in London for months, and we're staring down the barrel of a top candidate right here!!! It's the best I've had in London so far, and perhaps will remain at the top of my list for the rest of my time in this city! The noodles were doused in an ultra creamy pale cheese sauce. It was cooked to a crisp with its parmesan top layer. The inside was a white cheddar cheese sauce with double cream that was unlike any mac and cheese sauce I've ever tasted. It is one of the best I've ever had, definitely top 10 in my life. I'm so happy about finding it!!!PRICES: YOOOOO the prices for the sides were GREAT! All were about 3.50 or less! Which is a sharp contrast to the steak dishes which are 20 pounds or more. However all of the sides are quite affordable so you can order four or five and have that be your incredibly diverse meal! The starter I ordered was only about 8 pounds. These were definitely the cheapest things on the menu, but that's not why I chose them. They were AMAZING.The service was great as well. Very friendly server who gave us constant attention. However one of our party wanted her mac and cheese wrapped up and we were told they didn't have the license for that. Weird, didn't know there were laws about that. Especially in a place where people get such enormous portions.The place does not have wifi per say, but Wagamama is next door and their wifi fully envelopes the restaurant. So I signed into the cloud for free no sweat, and got fast internet while I was there!Every source says the underground stop closest to this place is Charing Cross, but I'm here to squash that thought. Leicester Square is much closer and is literally on the same block. Steak and Co is technically on Charing Cross Road, but that's not where the Underground stop dumps you off. Leicester Square puts you much closer.Anyways, GO HERE FOR THE MAC AND CHEESE AND LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN HAPPINESS.------UPDATE-------After flipping out in that review you might be wondering why this now has four stars when it had five before. I've come here several more times since writing it and the food is still amazing, but the service at times is deplorable. It's some of the worst service I've had, the waiters are wayyyy understaffed and are literally running around the place. This often leads to extreme wait times for something as simple as tap water or ketchup. It's a damn shame because the food is incredible. The people I have gone with could not stand the service, nor could I. And I'm the one who spoke so highly of it! Come on guys.",

It took about 30 mins to get a table, admittedly it was New Year's Eve and we hadn't booked!I had the rib eye and my wife and daughter had the fillet steak. They bring the steak out to the table seared, but still blue on the inside, and then you have a super hot block to cut you steak up on a cook to how you want it done. Quality of steak was amazing and their rustic chips were Devine.Little trick to remember if your going here, you can put your chips and other items on the hot rock as well to keep them hot whilst your waiting for your steak pieces to cook.Would I go back? Most definitely !!!",

Very simple premise which we don't have in LA but that I think would work very well if people would take extra care and not burn themselves and sue the restaurant because Americans are so sue happy. At Steak & Co. You a nice sized steak (8oz or 10z) in different cuts (rib eye, sirloin, filet), pick a butter, a rub and a sauce. It gets served to you cooked seared rare with a good sized hot stone and you cut & cook your meat the remainder of the meal yourself. Genuis! I ordered filet with garlic butter, salt & pepper rub and bearnaise and the meat was super tender. The Mac & cheese was good, Cesar salad was a bit overdressed and soggy and the chips and onion rings, excellent. I'm so happy to have found great tasting steak in London. Yay!",

My boyfriend and I have been on a mission to find the best macaroni and cheese in London, and I have to say, this may be some of the best in the world. The food was served quickly and the waiters were very friendly. The restaurant's atmosphere was very nice, classy decor. The place smelled intensely of steak immediately upon entering (which shouldn't be surprising for a place called Steak & Co). I didn't get the steak but it looked amazing both on the menu and on the tables of customers around us. There are about a dozen different butters to choose from to get with the steak you choose (six choices I think). Weird thing: you can't take your unfinished food to go! Something about \"licensing?\" So make sure you finish your food and enjoy it!Overall great place. Super, super delicious.",

The bucket of muscles (which says \"to share\") is great for an individual. The sauce isn't quite as tangy as I have had it in Italian restaurants but was still light and creamy. Also, the muscles weren't smelly, fishy or ocean tasting which was great. Sometimes you get muscles that still have grit in them, not at this place. We got a side of garlic bread to dip the sauce and their sauvignon blanc. Overall, a good experience. Though, they may want to be more attentive to customers as it took a lot of time and effort trying to flag someone down to give us water and lemon wedges.",

And we're really glad we did! I was a little intimidated at first because it looked a little pricey, but like I said, it exceeded our expectations. If I recall correctly their Lunch specials were less than $10 euros, although the regular menu, is a bit more expensive. Anyways, I had an amazing and delicious steak served on a hot stone with a side a fries (I think the steak was like $12, but totally worth it), my wife had a salmon salad, which she said was delicious and my son had fish \u00a0from the kids menu (which was also reasonably priced) which he also loved! The food quality was top notch and so was the service. Would definitely return on our next trip to London",

The melting Camembert was heavenly, and so clever! The wine-by-the glass prices and portions are great! Definitely come here! It's in the heart of everything and lots of people-watching to be had. They are also very flexible with their closing time, which was appreciated. We came late on a Friday night (still here writing this at 12:20am!) and never felt rushed. Thank you, Lucia, for the attentive service!",

She was great and really apologetic and even offered us a free meal if we stayed! We did stay and enjoyed the food, but, then the 'actual' manager came up to us and apologised for our wait and then said she'd be happy to give us a free.....desert. We had actually decided to pay for our meal in the end because of the great service received by the first lady. This other manager had obviously been told about our free meal offer and had come over to us to reset our expectations. This is why they get a one star review. If they had not tried to go back on their offer, we would have paid anyway and they would be getting a great review. Just shows the corporate side of the business where customers are just $$$$$$",

    "text": "Steak served on a piping hot slate that YOU cook to perfection = amazing! I've never tasted such succulent, tasty, mouthwatering steak at such a decent price. So here's the concept - all the steak arrives rare on the cooking slate, you then put the steak on your plate and cook it further (if you wish) as you eat it (by returning it to the cooking slate). You also choose 3 different flavourings to accompany your steak; a butter, flavoured salt and sauce (I went for garlic butter, chilli salt and mushroom sauce - there are so many options to choose from). The side dishes were also fantastic - onion rings, mash, coleslaw. Again lots of choice here. There was no room for dessert unfortunately (but definitely next time ). I'd say come hungry to eat here as the portions are very generous. \u00a0The staff are lovely and friendly too. Wonderful restaurant!",

Steak & Co serves their steaks cooked a perfect rare on a blazing block of iron and you let it cook to the perfect color at your table. And the block stayed very hot throughout dinner, so I could heat up the last few strips of my 10oz. boneless ribeye and savor the seared flavor.Along with a nicely aged steak, they offer a choice of seasoned salt, seasoned butter and sauce to go with your steak choice. Add excellent chips (steak fries) and my friend and I had a meal with a lot of different tastes and textures. Our appetizer portion of barbecue chicken wings and the garlic bread with cheese were also a highlight. The other appetizers we sampled were good but nothing out of the ordinary. All the servers were very attentive. Dishes were cleared promptly and we received new silverware for our entree. And a special thank you to Abbie the hostess, who was the loveliest person I met in London. Definitely try it out if you want a great steak experience in London.",

I'm embarrassingly fussy with meat, especially steak, but every mouthful of this was absolute perfection and I'm almost scared to go back in case it doesn't live up to the first time!It loses a star for the wait time - their system for giving out tables didn't seem particularly organised and it took quite some time for our table of three to get seated, but I must say that the annoyance from that experience soon vanished once the food came. Choose your type of steak, then choose your butter (garlic all the way!), rub/ seasoning (chili salt for me) then your sauce (Bearnaise pretty please) - the steak comes raw, with your own hot stone to cook your meat EXACTLY to your liking. And the fillet steak was GOOD!! The sides were ok too, we all sort of shared fries, onion rings and seasonal veg. But the steak... OH the steak!I'm salivating.I would recommend heading somewhere else for dessert - the chocolate fudge cake type thing we got was a bit disappointing. But go for the steak.Seriously.Steak.",

    "text": "Steak & Co can be summed up with one saying \"Nice idea, shame about the execution\". The setting, the staff and the menu seem nice but when it comes down to the actual details there is much fine-tuning to be done. I noticed 4 \"cardinal sins\". Firstly, the table for 2 is so small it is somewhat uncomfortable to even cut your steak as your elbows have no space to rest and when people on the tables next to you get up to go to the toilet or leave they are bound to invade your space or knock your elbows somewhat. There is limited space to even place the food and drink. Secondly, seeing as steak is supposed to be its speciality, the steak I had was decidedly unremarkable and probably below par compared to other steak restaurants as I found it rather tough and tasteless apart from the layer of pepper on top. Thirdly, the \"seasonal vegetables\" I had included carrots that were either over-boiled or dry to begin with, such that they had a sleet of white colour, plus there was no dressing or taste added to the vegetables. Fourthly, the waiter does not provide or ask to provide any sauce when serving fries which forces you to request it especially.What saves this dining experience is that the garlic mushrooms and mash potato sides are very nice, the menu has a good variety and it serves halal steak, and the opportunity to season and watch your steak sizzle in front of you is a nice feature also. Thus all in all, a \"nice idea, just shame about the overall execution\".",

The ribeye was fantastic, this time I went with the chili salt (which we never got on our first visit even though it was ordered) the chile butter and the red wine sauce. I also ordered the Mac and cheese based on the other yelp reviews... Can't say that I would order it again though. It was a white sauce with some form of very sharp white cheddar melted on top. It wasn't bad but definitely not what I was hoping for. The sweet potato fries came through though! They were sweet salty deliciousness! Oh and they have a kids menu! I can't believe we weren't even offered the kids menu the first time we came. My youngest got a burger and fries that she enjoyed. We ordered the sticky toffee pudding for dessert... It was a rather small portion for the price but it tasted lovely.",

    "text": "The concept is not entirely new. \u00a0Steaks have been served on a sizzling platter for ages and cook-your-own-food places like KBBQ have been popular for decades. \u00a0But this is different and comes with a twist. \u00a0Here's how it works:1. \u00a0First choose a steak: Filet mignon, rib eye, sirloin, etc.2. \u00a0Choose a butter to cook your steak with: Garlic, Chili, Parsley or whole grain mustard.3. \u00a0Choose a seasoning (shake): sea salt, seaweed, mustard, or paprika.4. \u00a0Choose a sauce: B\u00e9arnaise, mushroom, red wine, or pepper.Your steak is then delivered to you seared on the outside to seal in the flavor, but completely rare inside. \u00a0It is served on a hot stone which remains sizzling hot for over an hour. \u00a0I recommend that you remove the steak from the hot stone immediately and place it on your plate to avoid overcooking your steak.You'll then slice your steak to your desired thickness and then cook the slices on the hot stone to your personal preference:Place some butter on the hot stone, let it bubble for a moment and add your slice of steak to the stone. Sprinkle with your choice of seasoning. \u00a0When your steak is almost ready, spoon some sauce over it and let it sizzle. \u00a0Then enjoy your perfect creation.Repeat. \u00a0Repeat. \u00a0Repeat until the entire steak is gone.TIP: \u00a0Order a side of mushrooms so you can have your steak with your own personal saut\u00e9ed mushrooms! \u00a0Moreover, every item like veggies or potatoes can be placed on your hot stone and \"grilled\". \u00a0Every bite is \"fresh from the grill\". \u00a0Your food is never cold.The quality of the meat was top notch. \u00a0The filet mignon was tender and flavorful. \u00a0We also tried a pepper steak which was a filet crusted with black peppercorns that gave me the extra kick in flavor that I was looking for.The place was cool and vibrant. \u00a0The atmosphere was casual and lively. \u00a0Service was good and efficient given how packed and busy the place was. \u00a0It is not the typical steak house experience. It's almost like an adventure.If you love a good steak cooked to your personal perfection and happen to find yourself in the streets of London, I highly recommend that you stop by Steak and Co. and enjoy a different and refreshing rendition of a culinary experience.",

Maddie is her name.The only awkward thing was their manager or the mater die. He kept pacing back and forth throughout the restaurant. This bothered me cause he made me uneasy hovering over people instead of just helping out the crew. The waitresses were friendly but this guy had a stern and stoic look on his face. He does not look approachable.Food:Chicken Alfredo-I found it bland. The sauce and presentation were decent but it lacked the flavor that I am used to in restaurants served by the same dish in the states. Wished they added some parmesan cheese on it.Sirloin steak-Served in a sizzling hot stone. Comes in rare by default so you can grill it to your liking in the stone. U get a choice of seasoning and sauce. Butter is used as a oil base for grilling the steak.I found the steak tough. We did not grill the meat until its well done. Therefore, it is the meat that is tough.Chocolate sundae-Really good. Brownie burried under vanilla ice cream and crunchy chocolate bits.",

It was a whole new steak experience. AMAZING service by all staff members. We particularly enjoyed being served by our waiter, who was prompt and very kind. He anticipated every need of ours and brought them even without asking. I would go back just for his services! Ambience was quite good as well. Very decent but not too posh or straight laced. Reminded me of a more casual version of Hawksmoor. Ideal for any type of family or social meals. Overall, would definitely recommend it!",
