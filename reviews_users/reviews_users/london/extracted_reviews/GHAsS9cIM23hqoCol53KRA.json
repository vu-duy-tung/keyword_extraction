    "text": "Utterly amazing! As a new restaurant eager to please, I will say that the staff are what made this dining experience one to remember. We arrived for a lunch to which we were welcomed by several smiles and were catered for by attentive waiters throughout the meal. The view was somewhat marred by the typical English weather of course, with sideways rain and low lying cloud. However, the interior of the restaurant is stunning enough to make you even forget the 33 floors below you. But let this not detract from the real reason we were there, the food. A bolder statement may never have been said but this is by far the best dim sum I have ever had. The pure variety of unique creations made every mouthful a wondering journey. The signature dishes like the Szechuan crab and the 24 hour duck brought with it stunning presentation and served as a beautiful and memorable talking point.  Considering the number of dishes we cleared and the numerous bottles we drank, the bill came in very reasonable at just over \u00a3100 per head. For a special occasion this is the experience that you are looking for.",

    "text": "Hutong is yet another restaurant that you have to book in advance... think just about one month's notice will do. It's perfect for a special occasion or to impress visitors to London with a gorgeous view of the skyline. For four people, we ordered half of a Peking duck, spicy minced pork with string beans, seafood fried rice with dried salty fish and ginger, spicy minced pork dumplings, and one bowl of rice. Of that, the least impressive were the dumplings... you get 6 of them, but they are terribly small and not well presented at all. While it's a relatively cheap item on the menu, don't waste your time on them, as you can get much better ones at even a hole-in-the-wall in Chinatown. The Peking duck is almost a must-do, as the chef comes to slice it at your table, and it comes with first the thin pancakes and then lettuce wraps with minced duck and sauce. The minced pork with string beans goes great with white rice, but do know that it is at least medium spicy, so be mindful. I found the seafood fried rice very delicious but some fellow diners were more cautious about the dried salty fish taste, and I can understand that it's not for everyone. I thought it was the perfect amount of food to share, and the price point basically depends on how many big fish/meat dishes you order, so ours came out quite reasonable. Great value at a stunning location.",

    "text": "Awfully Chinese food with ridiculous price, let me explain why. I ordered Suan Ni Bai Rou (the sliced pork belly) which was served with a small plate of semi-liquid dark soy sauce!!! Allow me to explain why this is bad, the core of this dish is to demonstrate chef's skill in making a type of fresh-spicy sauce to light up the pork belly, it is difficult to prepare and requires experience of the chef. I was TOTALLY offended when Hutong serves this dish in such a odd way, no fusion, not being creative, simply stupid! Also, the Peking duck was sliced in very thick slices. It is meant to be thin, so that it will bit nicely when wrapping up in the pancake. Needless to say more this restaurant doesn't have the essential skills bookings a good Chinese meal. They are simply selling the view. I am rating this restaurant with 1 star because I could not believe why ppl rate it to high. In order to avoid a PR influence, I am giving my most original feedback and do not wish to encourage this restaurant at all! It should close!",

We were seated in a covered area away from the windows. When you pay extra for the view and do not get the view, it is disappointing. Our waitress Maria was not personable and I felt like she viewed me as a check and not a person who went there for a special occasion. She was not personable or friendly. We were rushed and she detracted from the entire experience. The food was fair with the boneless lamb ribs and sole with vinegar and coriander excellent. The hot and sour soup was extra spicy hot and little sour. The vegetable spring rolls were dry and without flavor. The fried noodles with seasonable vegetables were greasy with only bean sprouts as a vegetable. I could go on but the rest of the food was as disappointing. The biggest ripoff of the night was our waitress offering to settle our 183 pound bill for 320 dollars. Given the exchange rate of 1.60 dollars to the pound, it was a hefty up charge. Run do not walk away from this overprice ripoff. The experience is not worth the time, effort or cost. I",

We paired the spicy food with Sauvignon blanc, which was a good call to pair down any spiciness.

Then they told us that the second \"half\" of the duck would be brought to us in a different way. So they rolled the duck back into the kitchen and brought out a small plate of duck diced up and mixed with vegetables to have with the lettuce boats. In total I honestly think we ended up with barely 1 duck breast. It's just very misleading that they write \"whole duck\" and certainly make you pay for a whole duck then you hardly get anything.The portions were a joke and even though we ordered noodles and two appetizers in addition to the duck, we left the restaurant hungry.",

I mean, it's great if you're trying to impress someone or going for a special occasion, but if you're going for the food, try it somewhere else... Service was friendly and quick - the only thing I thought was strange was that we were served our tea out of giant cups! The reason being 'that the restaurant had run out of normal teacups' ..so that's why we were served with high ball glasses.",

    "text": "Despite being located on Level 33 of The Shard, we didn't hold the highest of expectations for Hutong. It was breathtakingly pricey for one thing - causing a bit of blind panic on my part at the sight of the menu, but I kept reassuring myself that View from Shard costs \u00a325 for the privilege. I admit View from the Shard is twice as high up as Hutong but actually I felt the panorama looked very spectacular from the 33rd floor. You were high enough to see the whole of London spread out before you, but still low enough to see a good level of detail albeit from the unnatural vantage of South to North. Yes I am a north Londoner born and bred.So once the menu came, and we stopped distracting ourselves with the view (which took a while - there's so much view to be distracted by) there was much confusion and deliberation about what to order. Most dishes are quite highly priced, and the whole meal came to about \u00a350 a head (without booze). We reckon with quite careful ordering you can get it down to \u00a335. Tip 1 for Hutong on a budget - the portions are big and the staff do not warn you of this - we had so much left over at the end of the meal. Order less than you think you need.We ordered half a crispy duck as a starter - which is meant to serve between 2 and 3, and costs \u00a330 - but actually it was plenty for four (or more) of us to eat - and after they carve it, they bring out the rest in a second delicious sitting. \u00a0I highly recommend this \u00a0on both taste and one of the better value menu items.My friend ordered the grouper broth for his main - a spicy fish soup which was too much for him to finish after filling up on the duck starter. And warning. If something on \u00a0the menu is marked as spicy, then it is woah mamma scorching hot - like this dish.Tip 2 - the price doesn't necessarily bear any resemblance to yumminess or the size of the serving. I ordered one of the cheapest items on the menu the jade tofu. At \u00a39.50 it was also one of the best things we ordered and a decent size too. In illustration we also ordered the crispy deboned lamb at \u00a331, and were so disappointed by the lack of seasoning or taste.Tip 3 - drink tea or juice. \u00a0Although yummy, cocktails and virgin cocktails are phenomenally pricey. Tea has the vantage of being refilled with hot water at no extra cost - the gift that keeps on giving.Loved the kai lun main and most of the veg dishes, but very much disliked the tasteless veggie soup noodle side. We also weren't impressed with the fact they refilled their Aesop soap in the bathroom with lesser inferior smelling products, and the ladies toilet doors being so tricky to manoeuvre and operate. However the boys do say they get to pee with a view so bonus points for that. \u00a0Overall the food was better than expected and you get a pleseant dining experience with the views, but now I've been there, done that and eaten at the Shard I am in no rush to return.",

We had a great window table view. Service was friendly & gave good recommendations for food & if something was really spicy. It is pricey- but you are also paying for the atmosphere and view. We ordered a variety of food. As a veggie had a lot of options for me. Food Ordered: Vegetarian hot & sour soup: Really lovely! Not too spicy and had a lot of flavour. Dover Sole & Coriander soup: My husband ordered this and really enjoyed it.Vegetable Spring rolls: Enjoyed these but served with Chinese vinegar so can be quite bitter. Vegetable Dumplings: Good but a bit mushy. Did not have a lot of flavour.Ma Po tofu: Spicy but really good! I was advised before ordering it that it would be spicy so asked to do it lighter on the spice. It was still very spicy though.Egg fried rice: Was really good- one portion is enough to share between 2Lotus fried root: Was too spicy. Would not order again. Asked for light on spice but was still too unbearable to eat. I was quite excited to try it too after reading all the rave reviews. I love spicy food but this was too spicy for me.Blueberry cheesecake: We shared this at the end- was lovely as blueberry was baked into the cheesecake.We shared a bottle of the Zinfandel, Sebastiani, Sonoma County red wine. It was great & they kept it a perfect room temperature. They have a bar as well to the right hand side that has a variety of tables that also have window views that are first come first serve. It was a great evening- we will definitely return again for a special occasion.",

The food improved from there, though.The spring rolls were sliced diagonally in half. For a simple staple dish, they were very good. The shell was crispy and flakey, and the veggies moist.For entree, I had the grouper with black bean sauce. Delicious. Dessert was less impressive, but still good. The lychee sorbet was light and refreshing. The fried red bean paste tasted good but didn't wow me. The golden dumplings made our dairy-free dining companion happy, which was good because it was the only dairy-free item on the dessert menu.",

    "text": "Unfortunately there are not very many truly excellent Chinese restaurants in London and Hutong follows that trend. It's main selling point is its location in the Shard but the space is awkward and not particularly comfortable. They have attempted to partition it using screens but I'm not sure that's the best strategy given that you want to see the view. The bar is small and cramped, so better to go to the one in Aqua down the stairs.Food was fairly ordinary. It is nominally Northern Chinese but comes across as pan-Chinese with Szechuanese dishes such as ma po tofu etc. The quality of the ingredients was excellent but otherwise it was all rather unexceptional. The staff were friendly and adequately efficient. Overall an underwhelming experience, which is not what you want when you are paying top-end prices.",

It helps that my boyfriend took my there as a surprise for my birthday ;-)We stopped for a cocktail first. The view was stunning, I would definitely go back just for a drink. We were then taken up to the above floor to our table where we went for the set menu. You have to ask for this menu as they don't give it to you spontaneously. We had seen it online so knew to ask.Each course was absolutely de-li-cious to the point that some of the tastes have popped up in my dreams more than once since that night ! I particularly enjoyed the spicy crab.... Devine. We splashed out on wine too.I loved the way the dishes were placed on the table for us to share, but beware slow eaters, make sure you get your share ! This is not a place for generosity ;-)Unfortunately I have to say that despite the 5 stars the service was only just ok. We felt a little rushed and even looked down on - but it didn't put us off. One of the servers was lovely which made up for the others being a tad rude - or at least not particularly nice. It is a shame as the night would have been even more special had we not felt that one discomfort but never mind the food and whole experience was dreamy. The price of course was high but it was expected and as a one off treat it was well worth the spend.Can't wait to go again - even the view from the toilets is epic !",

    "text": "Located on the 32nd floor of the shard. Walking in we saw several lines around the shard, presumably one is for the view, another is for the restaurant. Upon walking in we were asked if we had reservations, we said no and indicated we just came in for the bar. We were directed to the 32nd floor. There were no lines and the view was spectacular. Coming here for drinks is a really quick and easy way to go to the shard and avoid the lines and hastle. The bar area itself is quite small and pretty busy at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday but not too busy where you're elbowing people. There were a few tables in the bar area and having patiently waited for about 15-20 minutes we were able to snatch one up. Got a drink each. The Hemingway was delicious. The bar staff carefully created each drink with the utmost attention to detail. Obviously presentation was key to them. The decor is very aesthetically pleasing. The only comment I would have is that the bartender after making each drink would go through the extra trouble of pouring more ice on top to make the drinks look full. He was making the drinks right in front of the customers and would top it off with a handful making a mountain of ice on top. Your not fooling anyone and the ice melts anyway so why clearly pour more in, just get the amount right \u00a0the first time and pour the mixed drink on top your just making a mess and getting your hands all over someone's drink. The table space is about 5 tables can seat 2-4 but a lot of people moved tables and chairs together to accommodate larger groups so hard to tell for sure.Overall great experience for a drink and a view",

But also to have one of London best place for Peking duck.I have been to Hutong for both lunch and dinner. But I definitely prefer the restaurant for their dinner menu than the dim sum menu. The restaurant is based on food inspired from Northern China so there are many spicy dishes on the menu but also there are some non-spicy dishes to balance taste buds.When you visit Hutong, you have to try the Roasted Peking duck which is come either half or whole, and is severed in two stages. The chef will thinly sliced the duck in front of you and lay on a piece of wood lined with banana leaf. This is served as the first stage of the dish where you wrap the duck with cucumber, spring onion and hoi sin sauce in pancake. Second stage of the duck will come as part of the main dishes which is where the left over meat is diced and stir-fried with red onions and peppers. You wrap the dish with hoi sin sauce in crispy lettuce.The evening I took my guest from abroad there was unfortunately no chilled spiced razor clams. This is a nice appetiser to start the meal, although I do prefer it being slightly warm. Instead we ordered the thinly sliced pork belly with cucumber slices with chilli and garlic sauce. This is also another cold dish but is bland if you do not have it with the sauce.Hutong has a varieties of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks to order, whether you enjoying them at Hutong's bar or accompany with your food. But I always feel if you are having a Chinese meal it is always best to have it with Chinese tea. However, if you need to cool down from the spices then I do love the lychee juice.",

First, we had a seat right by the window (there aren't actually that many, so I was really pleased that they had taken into consideration that it was a special day.) The view was stunning and almost stopped any conversation as it was so interesting. It's a great height - high enough to see for miles, but low enough to actually see details. The service was friendly. They took on board that it was my sister's birthday and made her feel really special. They were helpful with recommending dishes, extremely flexible and just lovely. The food was scrummmmmmy! I don't usually like chinese food, but I loved everything we ordered. We had: Crispy peking duck rolls (very crispy!) Baked Wagyu beef puffs (my sister's favourite) Rose champagne shrimp dumplings (my favourite - so tasty) Saut\u00e9ed crispy shredded beef and chilli (recommended and oh so naughty, but good!) Tofu with chilli sauce (not actually as hot as advertised - it came with a health warning! - but really delicious!) We had a bottle of viognier, that was both extremely reasonable (almost cheap!) but absolutely delicious. The only criticism in ordering was that there was so much literature to get through and different options. We were spoilt for choice, but our waiter helped us make some excellent choices! We were running out of time, but decided to go for coffees as they smelt amazing! With our coffees, they served my sister a bowl of ice cream and a happy birthday chocolate! It was such a sweet touch! We loved it, and I highly recommend going on a Saturday lunch time - nothing is too busy (unlike weekday evenings) and you actually get to see the view in daylight.",

I've been to the Hutong in Hong Kong before and had a really lovely dinner there, so I was excited to try the London location as well. It was a huge letdown and I'm still wondering how this restaurant managed to fail so badly. The dishes we ordered weren't terrible, but at such high prices I would expect nothing but excellence in execution. The shrimp dumplings were actually quite tasty, but there were many things wrong with some of the other dishes we ordered, such as the green onion pancakes (very bland and flavourless), conpoy and egg-white fried rice (hard undercooked rice, and I didn't notice ANY dried scallop in the dish at all), and seasonal vegetable fried noodles (bland, overly greasy, and far too many bean sprouts). Tea selection was extremely poor - our server listed off white, black, and pu erh tea. This is supposed to be a Chinese restaurant...WTF?!?!? Service was poor and awkward. While not inattentive or rude, the whole experience ultimately felt substandard. Our server constantly mumbled and I could never quite tell what he was saying. While dishing out individual portions, he would also hover extremely close over me as I was eating. He also failed to bring out bowls for our fried noodles, and would interrupt awkwardly at random times throughout the meal. This place is just sad and overpriced. Go to Hakkasan instead if you're looking for upscale Chinese food.",

Upon arrival we were approached by a server who offered us 2 tables for 2 as there were no table of 4 available. However we noticed a table of four opening up and decided to stand at the bar and wait. We were then told by the server that we needed to move so she could \"do her job without us in her area\". I understand that she wanted us to move but she could have said it a bit nicer. We moved to the table and ordered some cocktails, I got a NuWang (pronounced New Wong) the drink tastesed of cucumber, elderflower, and a kick of Chili it was very nice and very refreshing. My sister ordered their take on a Bloody Mary and she enjoyed it despite it being quite small. Overall the view is amazing, the drinks are flavourful but very expensive. I was a bit put off by the service and I will probably try the other bars in the Shard before returning to Hutong.",

It will automatically closed, it only takes 15seconds to 32floor. Everything looks fancy and modern. However, I really don't appreciate the server. We went when the restaurant just opened, only a few tables were being seated. We were trying to take pictures, can't find one server. There was one server saw us, then he looked away. As a fancy dinning restaurant, this is certainly not the quality that they should have. They said they only have one type of tea-jasmine. We see other tables have a pot tray and we don't. The soup dumplings were decent though. The seafood fried rice is quite interesting. It is one of their signature; however, it doesnt have eggs. At first, we thought, it must taste blend, but no! Not at all!!! The rice has a taste of the seafood freshness. The only negative is that, not much seafood was in it.",

So when my husband suggested taking my parents to Hutong, we booked immediately a late Sunday lunch.Unfortunately we had the worst weather ever, pelting rain and really cloudy. But hey what can you do in winter. Despite the rain we were pleased to get a window table. The menu isn't vast but we did struggle to pick. As there was 4 of us we chose the set lunch menu.Monkfish and enoki mushroom soup - tasty, similar to sweetcorn soupDim sum dumplings: xo sauce and prawn, sea bass and shrimp, scallop and kai lan and pumpkin - I was sadly every excited to get my own bamboo steamer to myself (I get twitchy when I have to share food). They were really beautifully made and almost too pretty to eat. My favourite was the xo sauce and prawn dumpling.Wagyu beef puffs - light pastry with a sweet tender filling, lush!Prawn and cuttlefish in a pickled chilli sauceChicken, string bean and oyster mushroom lettuce wrapsKai lan in ginger saucerEgg white fried riceThe portions were very generous. The prawns and cuttlefish were delicious the right level of spice, but be careful of the the chilies I ate a really hot one. The kai lan was perfectly cooked and the lettuce wraps were delightful. The fried rice was nice and light and the perfect accompaniment to the dishes.We had jasmine tea with the meal so with dessert my dad and James had a beer and I had a glass of bubbles to see the new year in. I chose the golden sesame dumplings with apple and cinnamon pur\u00e9e, my mum and James had the glutinous black sesame dumplings and my dad had the honey and ginger ice cream. My dumplings which I would call sesame balls were amazing! Hot crispy sesame coating with a light apple filling, my mum being mum said that isn't Chinese, true but it was lovely. The glutinous dumplings which are very like moochi were delicious, soft and gooey with a lovely crumbly coating which gave a bit of texture.My mum and dad were very impressed with the quality of the food and the generous portions. This isn't always an easy task with my parents!As I said at the beginning we had awful weather. During the meal, the rain slowly eased and the sun made a little appearance breaking up some of the cloud. If you came on a clear day or evening you would definitely get some fantastic views of London, and I have a real soft spot for a view of London. I would love to come back for cocktails on summer evening. There are also some lovely private dining areas, which would be fantastic for a large group dinner. Can't wait for an excuse to come back!",

The waitress put the check down a minute after she delivered our drinks. We finished our drinks, tried to pay, and waited nearly 20 minutes until we could flag someone down. 50 quid for 2 drinks and some nuts, and the view is just not as fun when you're being ignored.

(Why?) so the manager did find out I didn't like the way it was cooked and sent another half roasted duck again for free of charge but by now we already had our main courses and the main course isn't all that either. I have to say I won't come back to this place at all but for the views I may go to different restaurants or the Shangri La hotel .

Then we had try Ma Po Tofu, string beans, spicy fried rice and the beef wrapped in lotus leaf. My favorite dish were the string beans, the spices on that were bang on. The beef looked very fancy but was just good. We also had a chocolate tart for dessert, we felt that the tart shell was undercooked and they were really good, taking it away and not charging us. Overall we had a good time, the view is unbelievably good and the ambience is trendy. Go for the whole experience. The food by itself might not be a draw",

I thought dining inside the Shard would be unique and offer us amazing views of the city. In the end the service, food, ambiance, and views wowed us!When you enter the Shard you have to go through a security scanner and then the staff check your name and reservation and show you to the elevator. The three of us checked in and were helped with our coats. We were a little early for our reservation so we opted to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge. The lounge service was a little on the slow side but the relaxing environment and the delicious drinks made up for it. Before we could settle our bar bill we were told our table was ready. The staff helped carry our drinks to the table and instructed the staff to add our drinks to our dinner bill. Our table was right up to the windows offering us fantastic views of London. The ambiance was low lighting, dark wood, red lanterns and welcoming staff. We ordered vegetarian spring rolls and Iberico pork dumplings to start. The starters were hot, savory, and delicious. For entrees and side dishes we ordered dan dan noodles, roasted Peking duck (served two ways), and seafood fried rice. The dan dan noodles weren't as spicy as I hoped but they were tasty. The Peking duck was first sliced table-side for us and served with sliced green onions and rice wrappers. The second part of the duck was served stir fried with lettuce wraps. I can't speak to the seafood fried rice as it didn't appeal to me that evening.",

It was very crowded and we were lucky to get the last two seats at the bar (there are also small tables in the bar area). It was slightly uncomfortable and boiling hot in the bar area.We were seated for about 5-8 minutes before any of the six bartenders even acknowledged us. They were very busy filling bar and table orders but also had their backs to us the whole time. We had to ask to order all of our drinks like we were interrupting them but when they did engage in conversation they were polite and seemed happy to chat.The drink menu has plenty of choices being 12 pages from signature cocktails, champagne, wines by the glass or bottle, to half bottles and virgin drinks. The cocktail options were in the \u00a312-\u00a318 range and the wines varying by type and region of the world. They did make the drinks with fresh juices, dried fruits and fresh garnishes. They had unique cocktails with varying liquor options too. We tried a gin drink, a tequila cocktail as well as a sambuca cocktail. \u00a0They were all very different but very refreshing and balanced. \u00a0I was a little disappointed in the small bite/snack selection. \u00a0There were olives, three spring roll options and not much else.By far you are paying for the incredible views being on the 31st-33rd floor of The Shard. The views are incredible, \u00a0even from the restroom and makes it worth the trip.",

Only to then receive mains dishes that wasn't our order :-( took them the 4th time to actually serve us our actual order which we still found quite cold but at this point had just given up and wanted to go home.

Hutong is atop the Shard, the tallest building in London, which affords spectacular vistas of the city.We dined at one of the private rooms, ordering pretty much the entire menu. The sommelier guided us in selecting our wine. The only thing I remember is the roast duck, quiet passable, and the fine bottle of champagne. Definitely pay a visit to the bathroom, which features fabulous views that you can enjoy while relieving yourself. The crowd outside the private room was lively, young and well dressed. So put on your nice clothes and have a night out.",

My husband very much enjoyed the duck fat old fashioned he ordered pre-meal. \u00a0The food was good but not exceptional for the price (a solid 6.5 out of 10 I would say) and in particular, the veggie side dishes stood out (dim sum was a bit cold, the beef/broccoli was a bit grainy and the peking duck skin wasn't crisp though tasted delicious and the thin pancakes were perfection).The good news is, we came for the view... and with low expectations for the food and therefore, were pleasantly surprised overall and had a lovely time. My main recommendation for Hutong would be to clean up service a bit to create a more personalized feel to each encounter (and to find a way to make the kitchen door light a bit less bright into the dining room, everyone near us that sat at the table by the doors asked to be moved, luckily, we were one more table away and weren't bothered).",

I visited again during the mid-autumn festival season this year and they had made the evening more special by hiring a Chinese calligrapher to write names and phrases for all guests, which was a nice touch.The food on the whole was good, especially the soft shell crab, which was uniquely presented in a bed of dried chillis. However, other than the view outside the windows, nothing stands out as being that exceptional for me so Hutong is worth a visit for a special occasion but seems more of an expensive novelty than a quality Chinese restaurant.",

I would say that getting here was pretty easy and easy to find. Mostly you're just paying for the view. Anywhere you're seated has a view of London. The food was great (ordered dim sum) but it's definitely not the dim sum I expected. It's overpriced for what you're getting and you can get better dim sum for a better price at any Chinatown. Plus there's really not a lot of variety which was disappointing. We came here during lunch time during the week and it was mostly business professionals stopping in. The wine and cocktail list though was impressive. My husband and I had a glass of wine and enjoyed the views. Altogether I would probably just recommend coming here for some drinks and not the food to enjoy the food.",

The restaurant is quiet and relaxed with staff always available but never pushy.Food wise I think Hutong is better then Oblix, which is a good start. The prices are high but you get really good portion sizes. We went with the Half duck, the crispy beef, Prawn starter and Rice. I was a bit concerned it wouldn't be enough but it was plenty! The duck comes over two courses-a starter and then bascially another main so it's two dishes really. We actually preferred the 2nd dish of it.Drinks wise, My partner is doing dry Jan so I thought I would join her and we went for two of the virgin cocktails...they were amazing and in some ways better than a normal cocktail, and half the price!Overall I really enjoyed Hutong, the food is not ground breaking and there are much better/cheaper options in London overall. But for high end, Chinese food in a great setting Hutong is right up there!I think going with a group of 4 would be ideal to give you the chance to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "Beyond the obvious incredible location and views, this place has nothing to offer. The food is so over priced and so underwhelming. Little flavor and all flourish makes the entire experience a disappointment. We ordered several starters and several entrees to share and there was not a single thing that I would call memorable or enjoyable. The beef in one of our dishes could have been chicken, could have been cardboard, could have been anything. The soft shell crab was dry and lacked flavor, it also was not cleaned properly so I ended up with a big bite of something not crab. And it is SO expensive. Not worth it. Go up to the bar for drinks (also not worth totally worth it) and the view and leave.",
