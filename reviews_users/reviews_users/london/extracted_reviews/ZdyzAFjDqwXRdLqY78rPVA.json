    "text": "Ok so this one of the leaders of London's huge lean towards american diner style eateries; this one with a bit of a nightclub twist. No reservations. So expect to queue. We arrived at 10pm on a Friday night and waited 15 mins outside and then another 15 at the bar inside. The bar wait was fine...the drinks more than made up for it, cocktails were expertly made and quick to boot. Server was young, trendy, polite. He took our orders quickly and attentively. Food came out pretty quick too. Burgers were decent, a la mode at the moment. Brioche, bacon and cheese check! Philly cheese steak wasn't up to much, i've yet to have a good one outside of the States. Fries were good as were the pickles, which I recommend.The venue is loud, dark, busy. If thats your thing then get involved. Best thing...its reasonable. \u00a3165 including tip - food and 2 cocktails each. 6 of us ate. \u00a0Worth a look, doubt it will last tho.",

But the place is always cool, and busy.I've been with the lads for beers, burgers and chicken wings. All great tasty food.I've been with my girlfriend for dog, philly cheese steak and onion rings. Again, these are great.I've been there for the triple chili challenge. Did it in under 10, got it for free, and the food again great.Recommendations are the chilli cheese fries, the chicken burger, onions rings.If you want a cool meal out, that fills you up go here. it's good. real good. I'm also a fan of meatmarket... which has a cut down menu (no wings), and a bit more chilled out atmosphere.",

    "text": "I think that all the big matches going on the day I visited meant the queue was unusually short for 7.30pm on a Saturday night - we were seated within 35 minutes of arriving. Our order was also taken and arrived quite quickly, although given my problems with Hunger Anger I had quite a substantial snack (i.e. a pasta meal for one) a couple of hours beforehand so was not getting stressed at waiting. I did however get pretty irritated with the fact that we sat for over an hour after our meal had been cleared without anyone coming near us to offer more drinks, a dessert menu, or the bill. It was particularly annoying because I tried to flag down several wait staff and I got that strong impression they were deliberately ignoring me. What I actually found most offensive about that is that it's just bad business practice - our bill would have been 50% more if this place was being run properly. And being busy was no excuse, as it was half empty by that time. My friend's theory was the staff are just hired for their look, as it's so sceney. They certainly don't seem to be in it for the tips - when my friend realised their card machine wouldn't let her add a tip and started frantically apologising, the server (one of about 5 involved in our meal) just shrugged!Moving on from my in depth service analysis: The decor is kind of hilarious, the concept is pretty much what you'd expect from a 14 year old rocker's bedroom (skulls, boobs). The stool seats are not comfortable at all, but that wasn't really a big deal. The music is very loud, but it's not terrible music so it's just about bearable. If it were slightly quieter it would make for a great atmosphere.Finally, the important bit: the food. Both burger and fries were very good. I don't like gherkins/pickles but I actually ate some in my green chili burger because the mix of flavours was so well balanced. The juices literally run everywhere, it would be helpful to have a tray/plate each so you don't end up with them all over your table/lap. With better service this would easily have been a four star review. But having read other Yelp reviews with very similar experiences I don't think I'm being too harsh. Approach this SAS style: define your objectives (burger) then get in & get out.",

We turned up at just before 6pm on a Weds, walked straight in, got our choice of table and had a really lovely waitress. When planning ahead, long lines and no space are easily avoidable. And to those complaining, this is one of the most talked about places in town at the moment - were you just expecting to walk straight in?The deep fried gherkins weren't to my taste, but the bacon cheeseburger, fries and onion rings were pretty much perfection. Piping hot, tasty and crunchy. The burger was delicious, and just the right size (for a hungry girl, take note men).The chocolate cream pie was also one of the best desserts I've ever had. No joke.Cocktails were punchy in rice, but really nice (and not shy on the alcohol). Ended up had a Meantime beer afterwards, which went down a treat.Can't wait to go back.",

The meat was perfectly tender, and the buffalo sauce was light and quite vinegary which really set them apart from most places in London. The mac and cheese was waaaay overcooked (the macaroni were honestly as big as penne due to overboiling).The burgers were all really good -- I had a dead hippie and thought the double thin patties were great (i preferred them to my fiancees single thicker patty), the bun was crispy with a slightly chewy interior, and the pickles and toppings were all very nice.We had one of each side, and everyone loved the deep-fried pickles. They're in an almost tempura batter with a side of blue cheese dipping sauce and the combo of everything was really excellent. As were the onion rings, and the super skinny fries.Our only qualm was the awful service -- our waitress knew nothing about the menu, forgot what we ordered, and was essentially useless, albeit very sweet.Afterward, I didn't feel excellent but that is to be expected after any meal with 4 deep-fried sides and a very very fatty burger. His meat must be a 30% fat because even after cooking to medium oil was dripping down my face.",

We tried to go here a couple of times before actually sitting at a table because I couldn't bring myself to stand outside in an effort to make a place more hip. Just take table reservations. You will not lose cool points. -The weakness of the cocktails. I ordered something that promised to be v. tequila-ey, and it did not do its job. -The chili cheese fries-Eating off of one tray for the whole table. I don't get it. American eating habits can be gross, but plates are pretty standard. I guess it helps them turn tables around quicker without having to worry about dishes? Now, onto happier things: -THE BURGERS. So good. I'm not a huge carnivore by any means, but a good burger when I'm craving it is one of my Americanisms that I can't shake (nor do I want to, for the record). These were excellent burgers. By no means gourmet, but just down and dirty and perfectly prepared. Plus plus plus plus plus. Despite all of the things I wanted to roll my eyes at in this place, the burgers are incredible. -Fried pickles. The only place in London you can get them. I know they sound gross and weird, but trust me, this is some seriously delicious fat-kid food. -The taste of the cocktails. They're really good. Just throw a little more booze in there. I imagine the restaurant is making enough money to afford it. We will definitely be back. The burgers are too good not to, and it's the most affordable burger that ranks. There is also a philly cheesesteak on the menu, which, as native Philadelphians, we will be back to try.",

We went during the five year anniversary where everything was 50% off (absolutely mad, and our wallets felt all the better for it). I ordered a Dead Hippie Burger (my favourite) and we decided to share a garbage plate. It's not a plate of garbage - it's a huge plate of chips, caramelized onions, a patty, and barbecue sauce. And it was GOOD. The patties in both burger and plate were dripping with juice as usual, and my friend wanted to go back to MEATliquor again just for the garbage plate (she hates burger buns and loves chips). They played some great music as well, and while some may feel uncomfortable in the darkness, I loved it to bits and am ready to eat more meat. Very friendly waiter as well who was nice and pretty prompt.",

    "text": "Anyone on the foodie scene in London will have heard of #Meateasy. For those of you who haven't this is a meat wagon of joy that serves up possibly the best burgers in London. Unfortunately, that wagon of meat was stolen and Yianni Papoutsis, the creator of these meaty morsels had to go guerilla. Setting up a pop up in a pub in New Cross to serve his meat, Yanni was a hit. When it closed, meat lovers shed a tear... that is until MEAT Liquor opened.I've got to really want it to wait 45 minutes, and I really wanted some of Yanni's meat, I also wanted his buns and booze. So in the cold last night I waited. Unfortunately, I also waited once I was sat down, waited after I ordered and waited to pay. The service here is a shit-show. I watched as one waitress walked back and forth 6 times with the same wet cloth in her hand not actually speaking to customers trying to get her attention, and ignoring the orders waiting to be delivered at the bar. Damn awful.But, I didn't come here to talk about the service (lack of), I came here to get my lips around a mighty chunk of meat, and that I did. My dining partner is not like me. He never exaggerates for affect or humour so when he says that this is the best burger he's ever eaten in his meat eating life, do not knock it. A little pink in the middle, the pattie burger actually melts in your mouth. They also have an outstanding selection of sides and starters. The buffalo wings were lovely and vinegary with a slight kick and the blue cheese sauce with actual blue cheese in it was perfectly pongy. As for the onion rings, that sexy batter that was light and fluffy, cooked just so that the onion doesn't actually get greasy beneath it's batter coat.The bar is also impressive. Sazerac and St Thomas are on the menu and they even managed to cobble together an Aviation when I asked. They have a library of hot sauces and I even found one that was just to hot for me - this rarely happens.So booze, tick, meat, tick, everything else, try again. Uncomfortable seating, really loud music and service that makes you want to scream. Was it worth it? Totally! I hate myself a little bit right now.",

Goddamn, if I were wearing pants I would need to unzip them and lie on the floor. Again, like a one-night stand... Between the deep fried pickles, onion rings, cheeseburger and chocolate cream pie, I think I ate about 5,000 calories easy. I didn't have a fat ass before tonight, but baby, I do now.*I love eating with Yelpers, they know how to get shit done. And this means ordering almost all the menu. 'We'll have all the starters, and all the sides. You know what, just bring everything.'The food here is to die for. Or to die from. I'm not really sure there's a difference at Meat Liquor. But come here once a week and you might find out. Great burgers, not the best, but good. The food is dirty good. Chilli cheese fries, slaw, key lime pie. Just get everything. Bring lots of money, you'll need lots of cocktails and they are not very boozy. * Totally worth it.",

Overpriced cans.We got four CANS of beer, 2 hamburgers, and 2 fries and the total was $75USD.Super silly pricing. The only reason I'm giving this places TWO stars is because the burgers weren't bad.Definitely not deserving of the price I paid, but they were good none the less.I would most likely not recommend this place, only because it was just so ridiculously expensive for the little amount you got.I didn't even leave with a BUZZ.

    "text": "Oh, where do I begin? I'll cut to the chase, Buffalo Chicken Burger... extra Buffalo Sauce and Blue Cheese on the side please... that dish alone is worth five stars to me, and for some reason consistently better here then at their sister restaurant, Meat Mission.Where they lose a star, and I hate to say this, is that it just seems too cool for school here... I've had every form of customer service, ranging from bad to good, but where the Buffalo Chicken Burger wins hereconsistently Meat Mission has consistently better customer service, perhaps helped by it not being as loud or dark there as it is in Meat Liquor.Another reason for a lost star that both places share is something I find quite odd... I like chilli cheese fries, but prefer the chilli on the side so that I can add it as I see fit... so sue me! This type of request is notnormally an issue at most places, but at both establishments I've been told that I can either have them with or without chilli, but not with the chilli on the side... so I essentially have to pay for chilli that I don't get... this urks me personally as I can't imagine how this would put them out,dollop it on the side instead of on the top... it's not exactly the most advanced form of science.But again, that dang Buffalo Chicken Burger... the best I've had this side of the pond while rivalling some of the best I've had stateside. The other dishes I've had here have been good, but I stick with the BCB and Chilli Cheese Fries sans Chilli (I love the mustard versus jalepeno taste theyhave even if I'm robbed of the chilli) consistently simply because my heartsings like Celine Deon and Mariah Carey's love child in their presence.They also have fried pickles, but more often than not they don't have much of a pickle kick so I shy away from them now... to be fair I see this at a lot of places though, both here and in the US. (Side note: this is why ILOVE the Panko Fried Olives at The Huxley in Edinburgh... they consistently retain their \"bite\"... I can't believe I haven't seen more of these little treasures.)The prices aren't that bad on food here to be honest, but as with many places they'll sting you on the cocktails... while creative, I've worked my way through enough of them to know they weren't my thing at this particular establishment so I stick to the beers personally.The place itself is a bit dungeon like, very dark and loud... it's a cool vibe, no doubt, but it can be a bit much if you're just hungry. The flipside of that is that if you're a tourist in the are reading this, craving some greasy food at a reasonable price for the area, it may be worth a visit just because it's so random compared to the outside of thebuilding and area.Be warned though, despite being off of the main road queues still form at busy times and there's no saving seats... they won't seat you until your whole party is there - they even have a bouncer, complete with stamping apparatus, to keep the order.While some of the above seems to focus on the negative aspects please be assured that I will return here, no doubt many times... I assume that speaks for itself.Speaking of, now I'm craving that dang Buffalo Chicken Burger something terrible. ;-)",

    "text": "Growing up in North American cities, I have fond memories of massive, greasy, juicy burgers with thin-cut fries. Meat Liquor definitely lives up to the \"American-style\" that they seek to emulate.I was feeling homesick, so my friend and I decided to brave the weather and try the fabled burgers. We arrived at 630pm on a weekday only to find a MASSIVE queue that was at least 50 people long. Not to mention it started snowing and we were both half-frozen...but there was no turning back. We were seated promptly once the table was ready, and ordered burgers, fries and cider. Service can be a bit hit/miss. For the record, the cider tasted strange - lesson learnt: never order cider from France. The cheeseburgers were just what I imagined, and needed. They weren't huge, but very filling...not to mention greasy and a bit of a mess to eat! The patty was pink in the centre (just how I like it) - two thumbs up for that. Fries were average, nothing to rave about. We decided to try dessert because pecan pie caught our eyes with bourbon ice cream. Demolished in less than 5 minutes. I must say though that I haven't been back largely because of the wait times, and the number of amazing burgers to try across town. But if I'm ever looking for a reminder of home, I know Meat Liquor will do the job.",

    "text": "So after a busy Saturday crawling round East London markets we had worked up an appetite and were in the need of some food... fast. I've wanted to go here for a while and as a London newbie it was one of the places near my work (Oxford Street) that I was recommended (As well as Bodeans + Honest Burger).It was about 4:30pm my girlfriend and I entered to be greeted by a happy go lucky kinda guy who said that it was 40-minute wait. I was a little bit hesitant but we headed to the bar. \u00a0I had a can of Budweiser (\u00a33.90 - 330ml) and the Mrs. had a sweet cheeks cider (\u00a34.50 - bottle), which her being the queen of ciders gave her royal approval. We patiently waited at the bar and the first thing we saw was big trays of burgers, chicken wings and chips and other amazing looking food being hauled about by the staff. We knew then we had made the right choice to wait! 20 mins went by squeezing/sneaking into other patron's gaps to upgrade our standing space as there names were called. We had to dodge old people spilling there drinks as they could not see what they were doing because it was so dark in there. We sniggered at the table guy shouting \"Adrian\" like the scene from Rocky and we immediately wished we had chosen a more funny name like Toby Lerone so we could hear it projected across the bar. Then our name was called.We were shown to a table right next to the bar were we had been standing and it was a 6 seater bench with 4 spaces. We chose to sit on the end opposite each other and a couple of minutes later 2 other guys were seated in the middle of us. It was not the best of seats and I could see much better seating around the edge of the main room. But hey I was here for the MEAT.Annoyingly the waitress came and the 2 guys that turned up after us managed to butt in first. We ordered straight after. Thanks to the yelp photo's I already knew what I wanted! We ordered 1x Dead hippie burger(\u00a37.50), 1x Chilli Burger (\u00a37), 1x Bingo Wings (Chicken Wings)(\u00a36) and 1x Chilli Cheese Fries (\u00a35) for the 2 of us. (Yes we were hungry). \u00a0Total cost for food (\u00a325.50) they add a \u00a31 donation on for the homeless, which at this time of the year I'm more than happy to pay. Service is optional.The food tasted delicious for me the chicken wings were the highlight I'd say they are the best I've ever had. The burgers were good and not having been to tommi's or honest burger yet I only have GBK and Handmade Burger company to compare to, Meat Liquor beats both of them for like for like. \u00a0After we left someone said \"OMG did you have the pickles?\" Omg we did not I'm afraid so will be having them if I ever go back. (too many other places to go at the minute)The seating was this places only let down but that's just luck of the draw I guess. It was a bit annoying sat by the bar to eat as you still had the Rocky guy shouting names in your ear as you ate and people brushing past you like a pack of lions running to feed on wildebeest. (yes they did make a good job of the place looking like slaughter house).",

    "text": "My wife and I tend to go out of our way to try burger joints. \u00a0This was my first trip to London and we decided that we'd see what the city had to offer in our favorite food. \u00a0We saw that Meat Liquor was fairly close and decided to give it a try. \u00a0When we arrived we stood in line outside for about 40 minutes. \u00a0No big deal because we struck up a conversation with some fellow Steelers fans and passed the time. \u00a0Once we were allowed inside I was a bit taken aback by how dark the lighting and how loud the music was. \u00a0I nearly told my wife we were leaving right away but we had waited so long already and were fairly hungry so we pressed on. \u00a0We ordered drinks from the bar. \u00a0The drinks were good and the bartenders act was fun at first but the production took so long that our table was ready before our drinks. \u00a0We got seated at a big round community table with other patrons. \u00a0Which would have been great if we could have seen or heard them. \u00a0Again if you are looking for a place where you can have any conversation at all look elsewhere. \u00a0We both ordered burgers and a side each, fried pickles for her and fries for me. \u00a0The fried pickles were decent. \u00a0A bit greasy and that kept us from finishing them. The fries were from McDonalds. \u00a0I don't know how they get them but they are EXACTLY like McDonalds fries...except they cost \u00a33. \u00a0The burgers themselves were good. \u00a0Not the best burger by a long shot but we've had worse. \u00a0So in summary, \u00a0the food was average. \u00a0The ambiance was terrible. \u00a0I think the staff was good. \u00a0You have so little interaction with them and the noise and lighting make the interaction you do have with them impossible to rate. \u00a0I really wish this place wasn't trying so hard to be cool. \u00a0I don't mind trying to be unique but this isn't the way to do it. \u00a0Will we be coming back to London? \u00a0 Absolutely. \u00a0Will we be going back to Meat Liquor when we do? \u00a0 Absolutely not.",

    "text": "Arrive hungry, leave drunk\". That's the tagline for this restaurant so it's really no wonder that's it's one of my favourites! The other thing I love about MEATLiquor is the fact that despite all the hysteria around 2 hour queues around the street for a table - every time I've been, I've walked straight in and been seated! (Sundays afternoons seem to work a charm!).As soon as you walk through the front doors, you're plunged into a dark, domed room complete with red lighting, wrought iron pillars, and sinister illustrations of owls, wolves and skulls adorning the walls. It's not for the faint-hearted and it's not very camera friendly but the food itself more than makes up for that! I actually quite like the vibe of the restaurant, it feels like a real hardened bar where you'd expect to find some seasoned drinkers glugging bourbon out the back and MEATLiquor seem keen to indulge that vision with \u00a0an impressive drinks menu to match. I always go for the fabulously named 'Donkey Punch' - vodka served over cubed ice with a dash of Absinthe and topped with spicy ginger beer, a dash of bitters and fresh lime.Meat Liquor is my idea of heaven with a hangover - I can only go following a night of drinking when all plans of calorie counting go out the window and I can feast on all the meaty, cheesiness goodness I desire! The tables each have a roll of kitchen towel plonked on them so you know this is a place for feasting. The dead hippie burger seems to be the sweetheart of the restaurant, but my favourite option is always the buffalo chicken burger. I can honestly say it is the best burger I've ever eaten (and I'm a beef kind of girl) - the combination of the hot sauce/ blue cheese and the crunchy batter is simply out of this world.Remember fries are made for sharing - and the chilli cheese fries in themselves are a meal! A huge mass of potato fries heaped with flavoursome chilli, melted cheese and chopped jalapenos - order these to share or face a man versus food challenge if you so wish!",

    "text": "It's very much a hate it or love it place (and I love it). I'll always remember by first time here. It was during that night of random heavy snowfall in February 2012 and I foolishly walked from my flat (then near Great Portland Street) thinking the weather didn't seem that bad (I was wrong) and waited outside for an hour in extremely adverse weather conditions. Anyway,..Ambiance:Loud, noisy, aggressive, weird. I actually find the interior a bit overpowering. There's a certain time (around 8ish maybe) where they turn up the music significantly, and I find it much more enjoyable coming before that time. Anyway, it's very much an experience.Cocktails:Extensive cocktail menu. Fairly standard pricing (ranges from around 7-10 pounds). I've tried a bunch, they're all pretty well made but no huge standouts. The 'house grog' comes with a 2 per person limit, but I had two once and while undoubtedly strong, didn't think it was particularly so. Likewise, all the drinks while good definitely are fairly average on the alcohol content.Food:Not the best burger but I find the patties to be a good size, meaty, tender and well-seasoned. Can't ask for much more than that. Many people rave about the dead hippie burger. It features some sort of mayo based sauce which I don't think it anything special. My favs are the mushroom swiss and the normal cheeseburger. The burgers are the perfect size imo. Filling and easy to eat.Sides:The deep fried pickles are an absolute must (if you like pickles). I find the chilli cheese fries too heavy. One thing that always annoyed me was that they initially only had plain fries or the meaty cheese fries but they didn't have on the menu, and explicitly refused to do, just cheese fries. Fortunately, (presumably because enough people asked) they have since added normal cheese fries to their menu (though I have yet to try them)Notes:Yes the lines get ridiculous. After the first time, I've yet to wait more than 30 mins because I try and go off peak. And as much as I love it, I don't think it justifies an hour wait (unless you have yet to try it of course in which case go try it asap regardless of the wait!)",

    "text": "Sorry, but I don't get the hype. The burgers are ok, but they won't blow you away. I would prefer to give Meat Liquor 2.5 stars... because it's slightly better than their sister-restaurant Meat Market, but not by much. As with Meat Market, the burger here was pretty standard. I had the Dead Hippie burger due to rave reviews and the sauce was delicious, but I've had better. The french fries (not chips, as the menu rightly states) were nice and crispy, but the cheese fries just WERE NOT cheese fries, not by any American's standards at least. They were fries with shredded cheese melted on top so that it forms that layer of congealed cheese that is hard to break apart, you know what I mean? Sorry, but that's not cheese fries. We also had the fried pickles and onion rings as sides. I'm not a huge pickles fan, so can't really comment, but the rings were good. Topping it all off, I had a root beer float (called something else on the menu and it was in the desert section but I had it as my drink) and it was delicious.Lastly, the ambiance is a bit strange. Really cool if you're looking for a dingy,low-key bar to hang out in. But Meat Liquor is a restaurant, not a bar, and I like to see my food when I eat, so I wasn't really digging the low lighting and the crazy decor. Just my preference.All in all, Meat Liquor's an ok place but not worth the wait in my eyes.",

    "text": "Ah MeatLiquor....two of my favourite words rolled into one!\"Me love meat and me love liquor\" just like what I imagine the cavemen said before us as this is definitely a place for the most animalistic of carnivores.Before deciding to come here for dinner, I'd passed this place many times and always thought of it as a strangely named nightclub. We came here on a whim so joined the traditionally long queue, as expected in London, but it didn't take long before we were ushered in. The club, sorry restaurant, is very dark. We felt like we were entering a cave. The whole place is wildly decorated, like the lovechild of Dracula and Marilyn Manson, with blood spattering the walls and animal parts everywhere.This was all coupled with the traditional Americana we have come to expect; a trendy diner come restaurant with booming rock n' roll music drowning out the chatter.The place was packed so we started at the bar. After a few cocktails of the Cyder Car, Fallen Angelita and Space Gin Smash our table was ready!I went for the hippie fries (I have no idea what was in the hippie sauce) along with a Bacon Cheeseburger. On a previous visit I'd had the Dead Hippie burger, which didn't disappoint. The food was fantastic and it was one of the best burgers I'd had in a long time.If you love your meat and you love you burgers then this place is definitely for you!",

    "text": "One day I was waxing on about how this American Werewolf has not found REAL hot wings and chunky blue cheese dressing anywhere in London on an unusually homesick day. A helpful cubicle gopher popped up and yelled out MeatLiquor in an almost Pavlovian response. This was quite a hike from our offices, but I was promised was worth it.The interior is dark and as a previous reviewer mentioned, masculine grunge is the correct description with fantastic archaic music. It is so dark that I hate to admit required the \"torch\" feature of my smart phone to read the menu. Disappointed they only serve canned beer, my concerns were swept away as I surveyed a board of fare reminiscent of an Old Southern Dive. Having been stationed in South Carolina for several years, I think I know what a southern dive looks, smells, and tastes like...I have been to Meat Liquor twice now, and I have had the same thing, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, slathered in REAL chunky blue cheese dressing. Yep, I can feel the humidity of the swamps as sweat forms on my head and my nose runs (a true sign of good Buffalo sauce...)I am salivating as I reminisce upon the chemical reactions in my mouth as I feel the burn contradicted by the smooth bite of blue cheese dressing! Not incredibly overwhelming. This IS London, so not the best I ever had, but an incredibly loyal manifestation of a true American mess.The fried pickles, another Southern delicacy represented well - but be advised they are worthy of an American sized cardiac from the grease content. The fries are a suitable substitute lower quantity grease option.If you have a weak stomach, heart, or easily offended - stay away.\"I'll be back.\"",

    "text": "If you want meat and you want it now, get down here asap - MeatLiquor is an experience and certainly one that shouldn't be missed, especially for burger fans. Given burgers don't sit at the top of my food agenda, I delayed coming here amongst all the hype it had a few months ago, but I luckily decided enough was enough, and I grabbed lunch on a quiet(ish) Tuesday lunchtime. The decor is enough to set your tastebuds to the moon and back, old American-style bar scene with iron clad bars and exposed timber. Bench, booth and stool seating with a nice bit of room over by the bar to knock a few pickle-backs in the gullet. We were seated right in the middle of the action, louder than average but a really nice fun vibe. The menu is vast and filled to the brim with burgers of all variations, and I mean ALL variations. The list is crammed with different ingredients, everything from halloumi, red onions, pepper sauce and mustard-fried patties - excellent! After a great punchy suffolk cider, I wanted nothing but the \"Dirty Chicken\" burger in front of me. I jumped in on some slaw to also sweeten the deal. Not much of a wait later, this absolute beast of a chicken burger landed on my table. Huge, almost glowing buns cover one of the best fried chicken slabs I've ever laid eyes on. The usual suspects of lettuce, tomato and onions were also stuffed right on in there...Lost in the atmosphere of EAT EVERYTHING NOW (Angry Face), I lifted the top bun and shoved the slaw right in...First bite, wow, second bite, double-wow and by the 5th it was gone. WHAT a chicken burger and it's up there with the best in the city! Outside of the burgers, the menu is filled with amazing sides including deep fried pickles, cheese fries and onion rings. And then there's the adult-only milkshakes. I mean where else can you get a Jager and vanilla shake! This place is awesome, a real in-your-face place to enjoy a couple of stiff drinks and tasty hearty food. It's perfect for a group of mates or colleagues to kick back and get loose. So leave your diets at your desk and don't worry about the huge lines outside, this place is more than worth it. MORE WHISKEY NOW!!!",

Back then, it already had quite a cult following, serving the same good ol' greasy, tasty, heartfelt food. Fast forward (maybe) three years later and here we are! Admittedly, I am VERY late on this review game but LOOK AT THAT LITTLE WAGON THAT COULD!! Oh you make me smile :')There's something incredibly visceral about this place. The loud music, the way your voice echoes if seated under the dome, the soft splotching of fried batter covered in buffalo sauce as it falls on the paper-lined tray. And of course, the grease running between your fingers, the grease on your cheek, the sauce trying to escape everywhere and of course all of that goodness making merry in your mouth. You'd never be more thankful for kitchen towels.Buffalo chicken burger. YES. Deep fried pickles. YES. Onion rings. YES. Chilli fries. YES. Mushroom swiss burger. YES. Dead hippie burger. YES. Chilli dog. YES.I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD SAY!Feel like Meat Liquor is the sort of place you have to visit (even if just once). And not because it's popular or 'cause of the hype. Without sounding too melodramatic, it almost is a bit of an experience!I can taste the buffalo chicken burger as I type this (in the middle of the night, obviously -.-\") and damn, I think we're due for another visit!",

    "text": "I've been a MEATer since back in the day of chasing down the 'Wagon. Those were the magic days, with Yianni at the helm, churning out some truly delicious burgers. Wagon burgers are still the best I've ever had, anywhere.Then came the days of trekking out to New Cross for MeatEasy, getting there before the doors open to have a chance of getting home to north London sometime before midnight. Again, great burgers but it's here the shine wears off a bit.So now we get to MEATLiquor. I'm not a fan of the look and feel of the venue but hey, I'm not there to look around. I have a pretty set order - bacon cheeseburger, and deep fried pickles but I sub the blue cheese dip for hippie sauce. Right now seems to be a good time at ML. The staff are better than when they opened, it's busy enough to feel buzzy but without a constant queue. The food is good but that great edge from the wagon is gone. The bacon isn't quite as bacony, the burger not as luscious, and the deep fried pickles are always a little too salty (but I'm a trooper). Still though, I don't leave hungry!I'm not a big fan of the metal serving trays - they're trendy, I know, but the piece of paper that goes on top of the tray always gets all wet and icky from the juicy burger. I don't want to eat paper... I also think that a burger joint has no business putting a service charge on the bill. You want to know why your wait staff wasn't getting good tips? They were awful. They're better now, but not service charge good. I also did not appreciate the \u00a31 charity donation put on to my bill. I donate to my own charities in my own way, and shouldn't be forced to support or feel shamed if I want it taken off the bill. Between the service charge and charity 'donation', my pickles, bacon cheeseburger, and single coke came to \u00a316.50. Just too expensive to be anything other than a once or twice a year treat. Sure, it's not expensive in the grand scheme of London eating, but without the shine that Yianni brings when behind the grill, it's just that little bit too much to make me feel resentful.",

And not to mention my burger was dry and flavorless, a monumental let down. We came on a Saturday at 330p to avoid any waiting and it worked. The food came out quickly but service overall was inattentive (I made a point to say we were sharing the cheese fries, but were only given one fork; my husband asked for his burger sans pickle and mustard but it came with; I asked for my burger done medium-well but it was very, very pink). I was probably most impressed by the chili cheese fries than anything else. Not a soppy, soggy and greasy mess but with thin-cut, American style fries that managed to stay crispy the entire 25 minutes it took us to eat it (we had to share that fork, remember?). The chili was flavorful and provolone as the cheese of choice was unexpected in a good way. The music started out great with vintage country (Hank Williams, Willie Nelson type stuff) that suited the dark, off beat atmosphere, but soon declined into the kitschy, familiar 50s doo wop of every other \"American Diner\" in London. IF I came back (and I would certainly not wait an hour-plus to come for dinner) I would probably skip the burgers and go for a chili dog or Philly cheese steak.",

On my third attempt to get inside (the other times the queues were 1-1.5 hours long), I finally made into the mecca of all things meat. It's very loud and dark inside, and the decor can only be described as an hipster slaughter house. As for the burger....I got a double patty artery clogging delight... certainly good, but was it worth the hype and endless queues, uh not really. This is one greasy burger. Note, the proprietors also operate Meat Market in Covent Garden...same exact burgers minus the slaughter house vibe and less of a queue.",

But that day they had a \"Burger Special\" invented by the founder of Bone Daddies (which is one of my favourite places in the world) - so there. I had a Japanes-y style burger.Wow.Just. Wow.Burger foodgasm right there.So why only a 4 star?Well - the venue place with it's notoriety and quick turnover of guests - but you always have to queue. Even on a Monday evening, we had to wait 20min to be seated - which gave us the opportunity to try their cocktails (amazing as well, by the way). I get it, but it's a shame. I hate waiting, I'm really impatient.And although the burger was an incredible taste experience - the sides didn't deliver the same kind of satisfaction. The fries were undercooked, and the onion rings (although huuuuge) were a bit bland.So yeah, MeatLiquor deserves it's reputation of being an iconic burger place in London - that you DEFINITELY need to experience at least once.",

    "text": "Meat? Yes. Liquor? Questionable.I love the irreverent don't-give-a-damn sensibilities of this ostensibly American-themed eatery. You'd think that having lived in London now for over a year, I'd be used to poor service, but even I was impressed by the level of 'I have better things to do than help you.' attitude from our waitress.Fortunately, there was another girl (a manager, perhaps?) yelling at the seemingly lost and confused employees to make themselves useful. Good thing, too... otherwise we might still be there, waiting to put in an order or get our bill.Between the three of us, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Wings, onion rings, fries, fried pickles, a variety of burgers, slaw, and a medley of desserts. Undoubtedly, the food was delightful and reasonably priced.Oh. Let's not forget about the other half of Meat Liquor's appellation. Well, actually... you might as well. Let's get this straight: I'm Chinese. And one that likes the sauce. And I like it enough that friends and significant others buy me books and other paraphernalia on the topic.If I go to any number of proper drinking establishments and order a Sazerac, I'm feeling it after one. I'm typically sloshed by two. And three is right out.Guess how many Sazeracs I had here with no untoward effects... really... try.So, with all that said, come for the meats if you arrive in time to join the queue before it extends past the front doors. Pass on the booze, unless you like yours mostly virgin. And skip Meat(!) Liquor(?) altogether if the wait's likely to be more than 15-20 minutes. Because, really... we're fortunate enough to live in a city where other better options abound.",

This was annoying as you have no idea how much longer you've got to wait. We got a drink at the bar and after about 10 minutes we were seated on the main circular table in the middle of the entrance section (shown in the bottom image below).The service was good but it's not a great place to meet and have a chat, the music was loud and the shape of our table meant it was pretty hard to have a conversation without shouting at each other. There are also quite a few bar style seats, which if you're a group means you'll end up sitting in a row rather than across from each other. I'm sure you could wait for a more suitable table, but when you've already queued twice the thought of doing it for a third time isn't exactly appealing.I went for the Dead Hippie, which is made of 2 beef patties, dead hippie sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and minced white onion, which nothing special. Following a great American tradition, there's an eating challenge - 'The Triple Chilli Challenge' consisting of a Chilli Dog, a Green Chilli Cheeseburger and a portion of Chilli Cheese Fries with a 10 minute time limit. Jack has tried and failed but the current record stands at 2mins 47s... Pretty impressive.",

Each of us had a cocktail and we shared the fried pickles and the wings to start. The pickles seemed to be thinner than it was when the place first opened, but they were still very tasty. On our second round of drinks, I asked the waiter if the barman could make me a fruity, rum-based drink (I had Meatjito in my first round and I didn't want the Dry Daquiri from the menu).. and guess what? They made me a really yummy cocktail which the barman didn't have a name for it! I was so happy that they could make something out of the menu (considering that the bar was getting busier at that time..)We ordered 2x dead hippies, a mushroom swiss burger and a halloumi sandwich as our main. We also \u00a0chilli cheese fries, cheese fries and onion rings as our side dishes. Food was delicious!We were so full and yet satisfied!",

It's sloppy greasy and dirty (in a good way) the inside of the restaurant is dark and alternative like you crawled into a death rocker gothic cave in New Orleans , hard to explain. Cocktails are great too! I would suggest going at odd times of the day as the lines/Q are out the door. Possibly I try around 11pm or other off hours of the day so you don't have to wait , they do not take reservations. If there is a cue I don't wait as there are plenty of other great places to eat in central London. If there is not a long cue I suggest you give it a try !",

    "text": "You can congratulate Meat Liquor on many things, but the burgers are not one of them. \u00a0For the geezer who says that the best burgers in London now have a \"permanent home\", you obviously haven't tried the best burgers yet.From the outside, the front door looks like a building site, with white-washed windows and chicken wire, and on walking in, it looks like a goth metallist's hide out. \u00a0Nicely tricked out, and with the hill-billy blues, Cash, and other American classics playing, I get a sense that this could be Trent Reznor's old New Orleans hideout, without the stuffed animal heads and deformed body parts adorning the walls mind you.Being Thursday lunch time, there was no queue, but we had to share a table, and a quick order of bacon cheeseburgers still lead to a 30 minute wait (and they didn't even ask us how we wanted the meat cooked). \u00a0As far as burgers go, these guys have hit the American experience on the head. \u00a0It reminds me of the US I love, in the same way Pizza East reminds me of the NYC I love. \u00a0Greasy, fat-dripping burgers, eaten over a grease-proof paper covered tray, without cutlery and only kitchen roll to catch the spewing juices might not be to everyone's taste, but this is the spirit of the Dirty South. \u00a0That being said, the best burger in London this is not, and the amount of sinew I found indigestible in the meat with as much if not more than Byron, though the price is comparable. There are those who would disagree with putting ground Aberdeen Angus steak into a burger, but if you want the best burger in London, then I would seek such things elsewhere, namely at the Rivington.Meat Liquor might be worth the experience, but to schlep from Shoreditch all the way to \"Marylebone\" I would be passing plenty of as good, if not better places on the way. \u00a0Certainly go check out the ambiance, and even queue for it, but don't go expecting to have the best burgers in London.",

Last week, however came the perfect situation. and OMG yum.yes you have to queue outside for a while (i waited 45 min i think.... ) but it moves pretty quick. but once you're inside! it feels like some kind of punk rock BBQ joint in an old building with strange Italian arches and raised and sunken seating. we quickly ordered Liquor (a twist on a Corpse Reviver and and Donkey Punch i believe), which came quickly, and although a touch too sweet, extremely drinkable. We ordered food at the same time, which thankfully came quickly as i was ready to start chewing off my friends arm.When looking at the menu both of us thought ''The mains look amazing! but the starters seem kind of lack luster.'' Ha. yeah. we were wrong. We asked for everything to be brought out at once and there was so much food. Buffalo Wings with Blue Cheese dip, Chili Cheese Fries, Dead Hippie (think double cheeseburger), and Philly Cheesesteak. and Onion Rings. The way the seasoning on the Wings and the Dip mixed in your mouth was freaking awesome. and the Fries? Hello massive plate of goodness. We're talking best in my life. and I've had me some Chili Cheese fries in my time. The Burger and Cheesesteak? Rather lackluster, actually. The Cheesesteak needed WAY more cheese and the meat itself was far too chunky. its supposed to practically slither down your throat, not gnaw at it for a bit. i wanted dessert, but after basically polishing off the starters (and 1/2 of my main), and 4 cocktails or so, i couldn't fit another bite. well.... actually i could if given a few seconds for breathing. but i had to dash off. So!i will be back.they had a Chili Cheeseburger that has my name off over it, that i must try.",

    "text": "Talk about an overnight success - it wasn't a month after I heard of this place on Thrillst that I was waiting in a 30 minute line on a freezing night to give it a shot.To be fair, the guys who do these burgers do have a good following already - first with meat wagon and the the popup shot in Peckham. And I consider myself lucky that we waited 30 minutes because we walked by the other night thinking if the line was short we would pop in for a drink and the line was at least double from when we stuck it out. Anyway, when we did make it in the first time - it was worth the wait. I had the dirty chicken burger - he had the classic hippie. Deep fried pickles and the lomo to start. He now will order anything with lomo in the name in the hopes it will be as good as that starter. Also, the drinks were top notch. it's just all good - guilt full but good.",

    "text": "Meat Liquor opened yesterday. Twitter told me so, albeit cryptically. My interest piqued, I rolled out of Bond Street station in search of the Dead Hippie and some chilli cheese fries and maybe some house booze. Lots of house booze. The quitessential pairing of red meat and liquor. Hence the name.And boy, was it as good as I remember it being at the #meateasy in New Cross. Except now I don't have to go to New Cross, I can just head on over to Marylebone. Of course, the best part was that there was no wait, because apparently only a handful of people follow MeatLiquor's Twitter feed after 5pm. I know this anomaly won't happen again for many months, as mainstream media is reporting it will open for real Friday. But no matter, I don't mind; it's just that good. I will happily go and wait to sit and stuff burgers and chilli cheese fries into my face just about any old day of the week.",

    "text": "Two stars. One for the bartending and one for being near a Tube station. Let's start with the queuing process because it's a multi-step process.1. Get in the queue which wraps around the building outside. Note all the signage about queue jumping and how they have implemented a hand stamp policy but don't explain how to get a hand stamp. The queue outside of the building is the shortest of the queues you will stand in, so don't get too excited when you actually step foot inside the front door.2. Once at the front of the outside queue, the doorman will invite you into the entryway of the restaurant. You'll stand between the two sets of doors for anywhere from 5-10 minutes.3. At some point, the doorman will invite you into the restaurant where (s)he will direct you to a set of chairs next to the front door where you will sit and wait. Be thankful you get to sit down because you've probably already been waiting 20 minutes and you aren't even close to getting a table yet. Rest and maybe take a little cat nap. If you don't feel like napping, I recommend passing the time by allowing yourself to get adjusted the VERY LOUD music and VERY DIM lighting.4. After a short, noisy wait sitting on the chairs, the doorman will direct you to the bar where you will join the other 30 customers waiting for a table. Getting to the bar will be a challenge because people will stand next to the bar and not move. Getting drinks was actually the best part of our experience. The bartenders do a really good job of visually queuing people and handing out menus when it is their turn. We were able to consume one full cocktail and were about to order a second when the hostess came through the bar area screaming our name. Have I mentioned how loud the music is in this restaurant? It's way, way, way too loud. Once you link up with the hostess who has yelled your name, you will be brought to your table. I hope for your sake, you are not brought to the table we were seated at because it is the Bermuda Triangle of tables in the restaurant. We waited 40 minutes for a server to come and take our order. During this time, I saw two other tables be seated, eat, and leave. After we ordered, we again waited. It's safe to say that Meat Liquor has the worst service of any restaurant I have been to in London. In fact, when we were in part 3 of the queue, I made a comment to my husband about how it didn't look like there was table service because we never saw a server during our time waiting on the chairs.By the time we ordered, it had been 1 hour and 20 minutes from the time we got in the queue outside. Our food arrived an hour later. Again, I watched multiple tables be seated, eat, and leave while we were waiting or our food to arrive.Now the food. It's not great. It's not even really that good.Fried pickles - Americans, do not get your hopes up. These are not the fried pickles you get in the States. These are slices of pickles (not spears and not chips) which are then fried in \"fish n' chip\" batter. They are tasteless. Actually, they do taste like something: fried. The batter is wrong. The style of pickle is wrong. There is no seasoning and they are served with blue cheese instead of ranch (and our server told us they do not have ranch even though it clearly states on the menu that their fried chicken salad has ranch dressing). If you have had the delight of having a great basket of fried pickles in the states, do yourself a favor and don't order them at Meat Liquor.Coleslaw - the best part of the meal. Order it.Cheeseburger - greasy with a small bun and no flavor. A huge disappointment.Fries - skinny fries which were served ice cold and without any salt. Had we been able to find a server, we would have sent them back.Fried chicken sandwich - my husband has not left the toilet since eating his sandwich yesterday, if that tells you anything.Meat Liquor is all about the hype and, in my opinion, there is no reason to eat here. The queuing process is ridiculous. The food is average at best. It's super loud and dark in the restaurant (you will not be able to carry on a conversation with your friend seated next to you). And the service is horrible.",

    "text": "I can't help but fall in love with the raw, gritty feel of Meat Liquor.I've always been a lover of street art, and am rather fond of the barbarous, blood splattered street art adorning both the walls and ceilings of this establishment.This is definitely not one for the vegetarians! Walk through the doors and your hit with a dimly lit interior, with bold black and white murals of half naked, fleshy, human/animal crossbreeds, clumsy scrawled etchings between them, all splattered and sprayed in crimson red. Red strip lights give this a underworld, dark feel.I know I might be giving a bit too much away by my guilty pleasures, but imagine the starting credits to True Blood, I think this pretty much sums the air and what you might expect here. Something a bit hilly billy (think the hills have eyes and Texas chainsaw massacre), a bit grotesque, macabre and a little wrong.I love art like this! But then as you might have guessed, I'm a horror film fan!The burgers really aren't that bad here too! And this is what Meat Liquor is famous for. You can tell where this place is before you get there, you can smell the meaty scent streets away!Although your arteries are going to hate this place, if your after a good fat burger, and deep fried food hit, this is the place for you.I don't think this is the best burger you'll ever get - but it's pretty darn good!Being the larger brother of Meat Market, you'll find a very similar menu here - and both should be awarded for the best name for a burger ever - the interestingly named dead hippie that features a double patty.Wanting something smaller, I opted for the Green Chili Cheeseburger and pickle fries (or gherkins if your English) and I have to say I was pretty impressed with the spiciness of the burger, usually you're get something meek, whilst this had good kick.Cocktails are also worth a go, I went for a 'tipping the velvet', and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Served in a glass tankard, it was well balanced and not too sweet.I loved how each table was provided with kitchen roll, nothing fancy here! One recommendation is to try the large middle table (if you can), this, sat in the middle of the dome at the front of the restaurant is a little off-putting (due to the echo), but allows you to hear what other people are saying because of the acoustics.The reason why I haven't five stared this review is because I have heard that usually there is a big queue, and as we went on a Monday we went straight in, so I'd like to check this out when it's got more of \u00a0a bustling atmosphere.",

The good - the burgers are decent (albeit super greasy), the hours are late, it's unpretentiousness and they've a nice drink selection. The bad - as mentioned above, the food is uber greasy, yeah I know it's a burger and fries joint, but you'll taste and feel of grease for hours afterwards. The fries are under seasoned, which is kind of amazing considering they have 4-5 different styles of toppings (e.g. Green chilli, cheese etc.), but they make the simple and cardinal sin of now simply salting the fries out of the fryer - the result being a tasteless and greasy \"dry\" fry when you don't have any topping. Yuck. Now the ugly - the service. It's just plain awful, no other way to put it. Both visits me and my companions have experienced different sorts of terrible service here. Essentially, a fine place to come to load up on grease and have a late night drink. Don't expect to be wowed (funny as you see a number of folks photographing the food!), but it'll fill you up without busting your wallet. Better yet, go when you find a 50% off food voucher (as we did on our second visit), but still double check your bill (refer to service comment above!).",

Good thing I took the night off drinking or else I would've had a double whammy of stankiness, that is... the wonderful bodily scent of hamburger all over me from my head down to my toes and alcohol breath. Sounds hot, doesn't it?Sorry if I've officially grossed you out from coming here, but in a way that's good because if I ever decide to go again, hopefully the queue will be shorter and I wouldn't have to wait as long. :)After waiting outside for an hour, my friend and I finally made it inside. This place was a little too hipster for Marylebone. I definitely felt as if it belonged in Shoreditch but I loved the vibe nonetheless. It was awesome. Loud music. Crazy people. Dirty, greasy unhealthy food. Pure Awesomeness.So what did I order? Bingo wings aka buffalo wings. Pretty good if I do say so myself. Could've used a little more of a spicy kick though. Mushroom Swiss Burger. Why did I do this to myself? I got through a little more than half before I waved my white flag. 2 meat patties, double cheese... I could barely bite into it and yes, it got all over the place and I was a hot mess. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger and I think he enjoyed it as well. We also got 2 root beer floats (brown cows) to wash it all down. The verdict? If I'm craving a burger, it isn't bad but I wasn't in love with my Mushroom Swiss. The meat was juicy and had good flavor so I think there's potential if I go with a different kind of burger next time. I love the atmosphere so that's another plus for me. My suggestion is to go early or go late. By the time we left the queue was non-existent but that was after 10PM. You'll smell so good after you eat here that the people you walk by on the street will want to eat you. ;)",

It was very dark and I could easily imagine a party coming from Torture Garden to dine here before heading off to play with toys similar to the decorations.We were lucky in that as there were only two of us we had only a 25 minutes wait, and doubly lucky that we were allowed to wait inside at the bar. The cocktails are great, a little bit pricey, even for this part of London, but well made. Sadly it took me 15 minutes to catch the bar-staffs eyes there were two of them behind the bar doing nothing, just talking to each other whilst one guy worked the waiting crowd. When we were shown to our table and ordered our food arrived quickly but the staff were inattentive, possibly due to the large number of people wanting to eat here. The chips were divine, but the burgers were disappointing a little too greasy and over-cooked. My burger-buddy and I were comparing it to other burger bars in the area and it came up short. - However it is apparently open 'til the early hours and so after a night out my attitude towards it might have changed.",

So I got to try the chili cheese fries, the hippie fries, the mac'n'cheese for the sides, and I had a red chili burger for the main. Everything was delicious ! My favourite sides were the mac'n'cheese and the chili cheese fries, which were a perfect match with my burger ! Yes, I love a good beef chili in my fries and burger ;)I really wanted to try the milkshakes (especially the White Russian) but I was already full. Next time ?The only thing that annoyed me a little, is the fact that we had to speak really loud to understand each other. Part of the atmosphere I guess !",

    "text": "My fingers reek of onions (in a good way..maybe not to the person next to me on the bus) but that's not gonna stop me from writing my review. I don't think I need to speak for the food in detail. \u00a0The chilli fries may not be for everyone, even though I managed to finish off my half (and I'll be running another 10km to shed my guilt). \u00a0I haven't managed to try too many burger places, but at this rate I prefer Honest Burgers over my Dead Hippie burger. Seems lots of people love it, but the dead hippie sauce was a sad mess of warm greasy mayo. Its also incredibly dark in there, so its hard to see your food. \u00a0I was too hungry to determine whether my patty was cooked properly or not.. is this why its so dark in here??Overall, the food is 3.5 stars, but I've lowered the overall experience down to 3 stars for the following reasons: - it was far too loud to talk to anyone. we had to keep shouting into each others ear- we sat in the centre, where there was a domed ceiling that echoed everything we said. \u00a0It even echoed the conversation from diners across from us - and I really didn't need to hear about their sore boobs. \u00a0- the portions of slaw are quite generous for \u00a33, so we had an extra (untouched) serving left. \u00a0I asked the waitress if we could it packed up, but she gave me attitude, \u00a0\"I don't know\". I explained it was good, but we ordered too much, she said the chefs are busy but she will ask. She did come back with a bag, promptly dropped it off and said \"I did it myself\" with a stone cold face and walked away, even though I beamed a smile and said thanks so much. Rude much?Not sure what was with the icy attitude, maybe it was just our waitress, but service does go a long way with your customers. \u00a03 stars for this one.",

The place was pretty empty so even though the music was loud, we didn't have to compete with loads of voices either. The music was varied and fitted the arty/moody exterior. Right up our street :)Usually when somewhere has a lot of hype and is popular we try and visit at a time when it's less likely to be busy. You can't really complain after getting drawn in to the popularity of a place.I'm from Sarf London so for drinks I ordered the Peckham Terminator ( which looked suitably girly - nice touch) and the New Cross Negroni. My husband ordered a Bourbon and Black - a boozy coke float. We were offered a jug of water without having to ask which is a small but impressive gesture. Usually you have to ask and it's brought over begrudgingly.Food wise he chose the red chilli and I decided to try my first cheesesteak - Mushroom cheese steak. We both enjoyed our choices. I particularly liked the steamed bun nature of mine. It was huge though so my husband finished it off for me.For sides we ordered the cheese fries and fried pickles. Controversially I think our faves were the sides which were even better then we expected - especially the pickles which had the perfect batter.",

    "text": "Meat Liquor? 'Tis exactly what I received. After a long week, our group was in search of indulgences. I needed a drink. We needed lunch. We needed a lot of things. Despite the dark interior (and exterior...I suppose, it is London) and 20 minute wait midafternoon on a Friday..the service our large group (10) received was actually quite superb. I spoke with 4-5 folks affiliated with Meat Liquor and all were helpful despite the crowds and pace of the lunch rush. In particular, our bartender was a gem. Wink, wink. Cute, too. Ahem, sorry. He also made great drinks. The Henrietta Fizz was not overly sweet and just the kick I needed to power through the rest of the afternoon. After being seated we quickly got our appetizers sorted (thanks Kevin L) and to our table quickly arrived onion rings that appeared to be DONUTS, piles of french fries topped with any/every unhealthy topping imaginable (Philly cheesteak fries? heart attack fries), chicken wings, and the list goes on. We ordered and I opted for the Dirty Chicken Burger...which is a fried chicken sandwich burger with all the trimmings, which seems to also mean a pound of mayonnaise. They all arrive on a tray, and unfortunately despite the good attempt they did forget one of our burgers...bummer. We obviously had more than enough food to go around so no harm, but still...our gal pal really wanted that bacon cheeseburger! All in all, it's an American-esque type burger establishment that seems to be quite popular. The food is heavy, greasy...just the way everyone likes it and the service was lovely. We got our fill, and then dragged ourselves through the rest of the day in hopes of stretchy pants and a long couch on which to recover. It is not health food. Obviously. Beware the wait times, but find yourself in a smallish group at an off time and you'll be fine. Once you do get seated things fly out quickly, so just figure out your order while you wait and grab a cocktail, you'll be in great shape.",

Why did I want to queue 50 minutes in the cold and another 40 inside for an OK burger?The answer is al down to very good marketing/PR, to which I completely bow to! Well done!Don't get me wrong, the burger was nice, but quite rather small, and honestly I have tasted better in London. The menu selection is quite small, which is not a bad thing; I had a bacon cheeseburger and of bacon I could taste none. The chilli cheese fries were delicious, despite staying with me until the following morning, not a good feeling.The venue is loud and greasy \u00a0it reminded me of a student union bar with heavy metal music. The cocktail list was fantastic though, despite not actually ordering any.All in all, I left feeling that the long wait is definitely not worth! Sorry!",

It's very difficult to plan to go there because one day you'll turn up and walk right in, the next day you'll find an hour long queue and you'll be forced to schlep around Soho trying to find a plan B.\"No bookings\" aside, I'm a huge fan of this place. In fact the only burger place I prefer is sister restaurant Meat Mission (you can book and the menu is even better). The burgers are superb. Possibly not the absolute best burgers in London, but for me it beats some of the other places by having a more interesting menu. The chilli cheese fries are to die for (and a meal in themselves, watch out!). The deep fried pickles with the blue cheese dip are heaven (and I don't even like pickles!). The onion rings are enormous but keep the right balance of onion and batter. And then the burgers... if you're really up for it, go for the dead hippie (two patties). I find the regular cheeseburger is enough for me. (By the way I love spicy food but the green chilli burger blew my head off... it was too much). It all arrives on a single tray for the table, which can make sharing difficult but you'll work it out. It's totally about getting stuck in and eating everything with your hands (except perhaps the chilli cheese fries). There's kitchen roll provided to help mop up but if you escape without a single drop of burger grease down your front it's a miracle. This is absolutely the sort of place you have to buy into completely otherwise you won't get it. It's ridiculously loud, dark, messy, undignified and unhealthy. If you're open to that get stuck in, go for it and you'll love it.",

The 3 of us waited 45 minutes to get to the door, then when we were let inside we were placed to the side and waited another 10 minutes while the hostess just looked around bored. \u00a0Then she told us we were to wait by the bar and it would take another 15 minutes. \u00a0Already we were debating whether to be unimpressed or maybe the the burgers would be an amazing meat orgasm in your mouth so that it's worth it. \u00a0At the bar we got 2 fresh orange juices (\u00a33 each), yet the glasses they were in were rammed with so much ice there wasn't much of a drink, and a can of beer (\u00a34) - yes, served in the can.We finally got seated at a communal table, ordered fairly quickly. \u00a0The food came out pretty promptly so no fault there. \u00a0And the style of the place is obviously \"grunge\" so it wasn't that surprising that it's served directly on a tray (no plates) and your only solution for putting your meal in front of you is to use one of the rolls of paper towels to fashion yourself a makeshift plate / place-setting. \u00a0Simple, somewhat practical - I get it - but the establishment's shrewdness doesn't solicit 4 or 5 stars. \u00a0Plus the dark ambience is part of the simple / dingy scene but it's pretty challenging to read a menu or to discern what the gooey stuff is on the burger (did I order that stuff on there or not?).In the end the burger was decent and not pricey; the chili burger was extremely spicy (be warned) and a bit sloppy; the dirty chicken burger was a bit blah. \u00a0good fries. The dark setting didn't aid in catching the eye of our waitress while we were finished and waiting for our check longer than it took to eat our meals.That was our first experience there, and probably our only. \u00a0It wasn't worth the wait, not worthy of the hype, and I could definitely come up with better burger ideas elsewhere that would either taste better and/or serve you cleaner & quicker.",

I won't say unique, it isn't unique. The bad: The line outside is more about generating hype than any practical consideration. It works, sad little plebs like us diligently line up for a glorified Burger King. The food is not exceptional. Certainly not \u00a340 for two burgers and a few beers sort of good. The service is hit and miss, it can be alright or you can wait 15 minutes for a drink and have a can of beer thrust at you by a surly waitress who then tries to take your tray before you've finished eating. The music is loud. Unfortunately it is not always good. It tries so very hard to be badass it's almost embarrassing. They've picked the most hipster staff, painted some naked women and skulls on the wall and played some Motorhead. At worst this is a deeply mediocre fast food joint. At best it's a cool place to go if you're drinking in the area, don't mind the wait and want to tell everybody about the super trendy burger you just had. I think this is its undoing. Is it a dive bar? Because that's what the damp paper menu and sticky floor suggests. Is it a club, loud music, darkened windows and the line outside would make you think so. Is it a diner, because the food is greasy and uncomplicated? It shoots for all these things, nails none of them. If it wasn't so firmly up its own backside, I'd like it a lot more. You line up for ages to stand at an overcrowded bar, drink overpriced beer, get hustled to a table where it's too loud to talk but it's a restaurant so you can't dance, but the lights are down so low you can't see the menu but it doesn't matter because the staff have forgotten you exist...you wait an age for service in a mixture of rubbernecking silence and REALLY LOUD SHOUTING. You eat a tepid, very greasy burger (it's okay, they give you a kitchen roll instead of napkins, stick it to the man with his napkins etc) and get shooed out onto the street as soon as they can get you to pay the inexplicably high bill. Won't rush back.",

As it was kind of busy, I got a place at the bar. Which is okay, the staff are nice, but still constantly rushing around you. Although most of them are quite stylish (whatever this exactly means), sort of hipster-esque and nice to look at, sitting in a busy corner isn't always the best experience. Unfortunately then a group was said to wait just next to me at the bar for their table, which didn't make my place more convenient. But the bustle and that aside, it's a cool place for a tasty burger. You shouldn't expect too much perhaps, but if you don't queue too long, it's definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Now then. As many have said, meat liquor isn't just about the burgers. It's about the queuing. The lovely people who own the restaurant have decided to not allow bookings. While this is great for those of us who are disorganised, the slightly OCD crew who book restaurants, cinemas and theatres months in advance are feeling at a great disadvantage. So here's the deal. We queued. I think it took us nearly an hour to get from the parking entrance to the front door. And then another 30min at the bar (having absolutely delicious cocktails \u00a0and based on feedback from the boys, DO try the grog) before they found us a table. Well, we were 8 very hungry people. It's not that easy to sit a table of 8! Then we did sit. Service came quickly and was efficient. Food appeared soon thereafter, on platters. No plates, btw. So make good use of the provided kitchen towels and cover the table in front of you as well as your lap. Oh, and do try the chilli cheese fries, they are to die for! Then the burgers came! Goodness, they were GOOD! I cannot describe it. Good bread, good quality ingredients, good meat, cooked to perfection (all medium to medium-well), and the bacon in my cheeseburger was deliciously ever so slightly crunchy and didn't have the typical ribbon of fat on the side. Perhaps they thought to trim it? Who knows! Overall, I truly enjoyed the burger, the entrees (chilli cheese fries for the win!), the dribbliness of everything, the MEAT, and, of course, the cocktails! No wonder it's called meat liquor. Amusingly enough, some cocktails cost more than the burgers. Truly sensible pricing. And for a hugely hyped place in central London! Well done!! Oh, one word of advice. Don't wear your best clothes. Accidents happen, there are no plates, and the environment / decor is slightly grungy. Suits won't fit in, unless it's post-fight-club.",

I know it couldn't be any other way, but hanging around at the bar when you want to be seated and eat just isn't my thing. People should definitely go there, but for me it'll only the once, I think. Super greasy and super rich. The chilli cheese fries were good but got too much. The meals are just so heavy it makes you feel sluggish and I didn't even eat dinner that night (good value for money?) You only need to get one side \u00a0Don't go over board. The fries themselves were also a little plain.I just don't think I could face it again.",

    "text": "Any burger joint that offers a kitchen roll on each table and deep fried pickles with bleu cheese dip on the menu earns an A+ in my book. I love the simple packaging: no-fuss bun, simple dressing (thick-sliced, flavourful pickles). Extras like bacon and chili are perfect enhancements, in just enough volume and with just enough kick to add to the flavour without overwhelming the meat, which is perfectly seasoned and cooked a perfect medium, which the cheese slice melted just so on top. Burgers are the perfect size. Buffalo wings are easily the best in London. Other pluses: Friendly, attentive service \u00a0Excellent front of house team. Fun, appropriate music (as opposed to the Korean joint M & I visited last night that was pumping deep house, which most certainly did not add to the kimchi experience). Great pricing (\u00a37 burgers!), especially in the midst of Tourist Central. Great drinks \u00a0non-alcholic ones served in mason jars and boozy ones in frosted steins \u00a0what more can you ask for?? Have yet to try the rabbit food options on the menu and don't see it happening anytime soon Only downsides are long queues but off-peak hours work a charm. Wear clothes appropriate for burger juices running down your forearms. Sounds like heaven? It is.",

    "text": "Honestly, I really don't understand what all of the hype is about. I went to Meat Liquor on a Thursday at 7, so it definitely wasn't packed. Found a table and ordered the buffalo wings, mac n' cheese, chilli cheese fries, a dead hippie and a chilli cheese burger. The food arrived in a timely matter, but the mac n' cheese was a bit cold and the cheese didn't seem to be distributed throughout rather just on top and underneath the macaroni was bland and dry. Buffalo wings normally have a spicy buffalo sauce which was no where in sight. My friend really enjoyed her chilli cheese burger and overall the dead hippie was good, but definitely not worth the hike and maybe not even worth my traveling time from Angel to Marylebone. The flavors were there, but a pool of oil gushed out from my burger. Yes, I checked to see if it was just the juices from my burger. Unfortunately, it was just oil, which is odd since my friend's burger didn't have this oily pool going on. So I was a bit underwhelmed by the burgers, but what was shocking was the service here. It took less time to eat then to catch the waitress' attention to have my order taken. Also had to wait 15 minutes for the bill to come although it wasn't that busy. The waitresses seem inexperienced and clueless. There is no kind of service and maybe I'm just critical because I work in the industry as well, but it was just shocking. On another note, there are two great wines in stock at Meat Liquor. Both wines are produced by Charles Smith (used to be in the rock business so definitely fits with the decor), for a great Merlot I'd suggest the Velvet Devil. For something crisp and with floral undertones go for the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I normally hate whites, but this one is fantastic. Anyways, I'd rather go to Hawksmoor or even Goodman for a burger. Meat Liquor is overrated.",

Buffalo chicken burger,buffalo wings,onion rings and fries! A feast fit for a Viking king I tell you! That burger was so juicy and delicious I almost...ALMOST forgot who I was! Yes ladies and gents...burger memory loss! Happens to a few of us when the taste gets too real !The buffalo wings were crispy and coated in buffalo sauce! Which I need to bathe in at some point in life!Oh the blue cheese dip is the best I've had anywhere in London so far.Onion rings were too oily for me but still tasted lovely.. And the fries were perfect! Best part were the cheap prices! All of this was under \u00a324 (between two people) . The staff are friendly and polite too.. Can't go wrong really...

Me and three friends went on a sunday and had a range of things from the menu, I can thoroughly recommend the dead hippie burger with the hippie fried being a great addition. The onion rings are some of the best I've had and the deep friend Mac and cheese is great. It is a true dining experience not one for a smart night out, you will get messy and you don't get plates so be prepared for a good old hands on meat experience.",

This place is not for the healthy soul! Nor is it a place for those looking for some peace because the music is really loud in every part of the restaurant. It is definitely not the place to go if you want to have a conversation where you do not want to be shouting.I have heard from others how long the queue but when we visited there was not a long queue. In minutes we got through the door in to the dark and noisy restaurant to wait at the bar. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of two people.All the food is served on a tray lined with a grease paper. The burger was not very pretty in presentation and it does make other fast food chain's burgers look better. The beef patty at Meat Liquor is moist and I love the melted cheese. But it was greasy and messy to eat.As well as a burger I tried a selection of sides - portion of fries, onion rings and deep-fried mac 'n' cheese. The onion rings were the biggest onion rings I have seen. Each one was in a crispy battered coating.",

But if you're looking for something salty and fatty, this is the place!We came here on a Saturday around 5:30p and had to queue for about a half hour. The line grew very quickly so I'd recommend coming earlier rather than later. The queuing experience was surprisingly pleasant because they offered us onion rings and fried pickles! (I'd recommend the pickles.)We ordered the cheeseburger, cheese fries, and wings. Everything was salty and a teeny bit overly soggy. The wings were really good and the portion was quite generous. If I return, I'd skip the cheese fries because they were soft and the cheddar had completely solidified over the fries. As for the burger, I prefer Honest Burger over Meat Liquor's.",

Well boy did they!?It was a toss up between Meat Liquor or Meat Mission but we decided to Meat Liquor (closer to home and reviews on Yelp swayed me)I've heard queues can get ridiculous so we rocked up pretty early at 6. It was getting busy but we were seated straight away.Man is it dark and noisy but you know what I liked it even though I couldn't hear my bf half the time.Unlike Meat Market, there is table service, staff were friendly and service was reasonably quick.Well the food was amazing! I had the bacon and cheese burger - soooo good, especially the bacon! Bf had the red chilli burger which he liked but preferred mine! I tried the chilli - was delish but a bit spicy for me. We also got onion rings (the biggest and crispest you ever did see), coleslaw (to be healthy) and Mac and cheese bites to share. Best Onion rings I've ever had (no lie) and I bloomin love the Mac and cheese. Menu is slightly different here (less burger choice) and also there is a side (monkey fingers) I want to try from Meat Mission so will definitely be going there next - if my heart can take it!They also don't do puddings which is a shame however I was so insanely full it shouldn't have mattered!In all came to \u00a330 with a cocktail and 2 beers (50% off food) and tip - not bad seeing as I could barely roll home!",

We came on a Monday night so it was fairly quiet. The only thing was the service was awful. Our server barely spoke above a whisper and came over only once. Made it difficult to get the bill. When we did receive the bill, they had added on gratuity (we were a party 2... so thats not really fair) and a 'donation.' When I queried the server what the 'donation' was for, she said she wasn't sure. I obviously demanded it be taken off our bill as I will not be coerced into making a donation to something I dont even know. I also asked for the gratuity to be taken off, as its quite presumptuous to add that on. Being Canadian, I happily tip generously when I receive good service but I think its shameful for a restaurant to add automatic gratuities onto small parties - especially when the service is so painfully mediocre.",

Succulent, perfectly cooked beef patty, and the extras were all decent/good. Plus for a perfectly sized bun that was sturdy enough to contain the burger+juices all the way through and didn't taste like plastic. The fries were basically McDonald's fries. Horrible and sad. Plus for the array of condiments on the table. Atmosphere: they're clearly going for ultra-casual, with scribbled-on and carved-up wooden beams and classroom chairs and stools. The weird thing is the tinted windows, which gives the whole place a dark, brooding feel which doesn't make you want to go in and doesn't rouse your appetite. Service: Friendly and helpful. Food came out relatively promptly. I asked for my burger without pickles and ketchup. It arrived without the latter, but with the former. One thing to change: the fries! Get us some real skin-on fries and maybe sweet potato fries as an alternative.",

And that's what you get if you go to 'Meat Liquor'. I was a big fan of 'Meat Mission' already so I though: I'm sure it will be fine.We got a nice table, next to the bar. It is similar to \u00a0'Meat Mission': dark and loud (music is even louder there). I didn't care, I was in heaven. Burgers and booze everywhere! We ordered straight away. Service was fun and lovely! Our drinks and food in perfect time. Soooo gooood. We devoued our burgers and sides.I was really tired so we didn't stay long. It was really crowded and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun. Next time! I'll come back for sure.",

You and your friends definitely don't want to go there, as it's not worth waiting outside in the cold.Ehem.*I should probably mention that I am not particularly good at lying... the queue for this place on a friday night was already pretty long (and I really don't want it to get longer) ...so yes, this place is absolutely awful, and you shouldn't go there to make me have to wait longer for my meat!!Now I've got my lies out the way, this was easily the nicest burger of 2011. It was succulent, saucy and just delicious. I think all three of my friends agreed, as we all stopped talking for a while as we stuffed our faces with meaty joy. We loooved the fried pickles as well.The cocktails were pretty awesome too. It seems strange spending the same amount (or double) on cocktails as meat...but you can't really complain when they taste that good. Now, although this place serves 5 star burgers, it was pretty cold (bring a jumper!), the staff were a little hard to flag down, and the music was a bit too loud to be able to chat easily. I'm still going back though...the meat makes it worth it.",

A bear and a wolf among other animals bare their teeth at you from a ceiling scrawled over with red words. Skulls adorn the walls and the place is pretty dark with very very loud music, so you can't really hear yourself. I like meat though and i'm happy to eat it in the dark so I ordered the Dead Hippie burger and my husband got the Mushroom Swiss. We ended up switching burgers, but we were both happy with the switch. I think the Dead Hippie was overflowing with sauce and toppings and I prefer my burgers simpler. It wasn't the best I've had in London, but it was a good solid burger. I might get takeaway though next time as I'd rather eat it somewhere that is not trying so hard to be rock'n'roll, but I know a few people who would love to rock out here and this will be a fun place to take them.",

Pickles are nice and thick, right amour of grease, good size bun with the right texture and slight sweetness... It is a really great combination of flavours and texture.We had hippi fries, cheese burger, bacon cheese burger and they were all great. Especially hippi fries... One of the few times I actually enjoyed paying extra on fries... This is if you like the flavour of saut\u00e9ed onions. The only downside of the place for me is smell and lack of bright light. I understand that the venue is going for grunge look and feel but the place smells like old, stale bars... With no burger smell! Also it is too dark for me... Call me old school but I prefer enough lights to see what I am exactly eating.",

Admittedly i queued for an hour to get thought the door (be patient, it's worth every second) but the food was sensational and although the restaurant was filled to the brim, service was fast and efficient. Me and my friend shared a cheeseburger, chilli cheese fries, buffalo wings and a chill dog, WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. Even though they were the best chicken wings i've ever had i couldn't fit one more in. So my advice: order sensibly and not with your stomach. I actually ate so much Man vs Food style i was sick. Just emphasising that i couldn't stop eating their delish food. Oh and the cocktails are fabulous and reasonably priced for London. I suggest the Meatjito and Henrietta Fizz (i had about four)I enjoyed myself too much here and can't wait to not eat for a week so i can go and pig out again. LOVE it.",

    "text": "Isn't this the best possible name for a restaurant ? I think it is. So ever since i read on Yelp about its opening, it has been consistently on the top of my list of new places to try out. But one thing led to another, and i didn't have a chance until last Saturday when i finally made a firm plan.My friend dropped out at the last minute, but i still went on alone.Meat liquor is known for its long waits. Its a place where you cannot book a table and your friends cannot preserve a place for you in the queue. But i had gambled that Saturday lunch time wouldn't be the busiest slot in the week for them ... and i was right. I was alone and i found a table straight-away. However even larger groups had to wait for only a short while. The restaurant was busy, but only moderately so.I was taken aback when i stepped into the dining area. It was dark, with reasonably poor visibility, and lit only by red lights. Did I enter a gentlemen's club by mistake ? No ... the people were busy eating food, so I must have been at the correct place. The food menu was small, only about a page long, and consists primarily of a variety of burgers. I went for a standard bacon and cheeseburger. At around \u00a37, \u00a0it's considerably cheaper than the \u00a320 burgers at B & L. It was big enough to be filling, and it was tasty. But I didn't enjoy the piece of pickle inside ... I would have preferred my burger without it. The burger went very well with mustard sauce. The fries (not chips) were fabulous and the portion size was pretty large. For liquor, I went for the \"grog\". It was basically a very strong rum punch, made with a variety of added juices and syrups. The taste of mango dominated. The cocktail was great but I didn't think it was strong enough to deserve the 2 per person limit. The cocktail menu otherwise was quite conventional, with only the usual alternatives. At \u00a39, the cocktails were priced appropriately for the location of the restaurant. So all in all i had a simple and satisfying lunch for less than \u00a320. Although Meat Liquor did not impress me enough to want to brave the legendary queues, I would happily return for mid day meals on Saturdays.",

A year or so ago I knew things were going downhill when I queued behind an older crowd asking why they were queuing to eat. Today I have visited to find the menu almost unrecognisable. The Philly Cheesesteak has gone forever, as though my heart wasn't broken after they discontinued the Crack Pie made with rum butter. I finally got to try a frozen banana today (my last three attempts here and at Mission failed) and it turned out to be half a banana with the chocolate and nut coating added before it was frozen.

    "text": "I cannot comment on the ambience as we had take-away (or let's call it 'takeout' as the food scene in London is being AmericaniZed, what with Puck, Boloud, Jean-Georges Von Re... Von Ri...oh heck, I never remember how to spell his name, the Spice Market guy)I will start by saying that I called to ask if they offer 'takeout' and was give an affirmative reply. Alas, when my colleague went to pickup the food they had NOTHING TO CARRY IT IN. \u00a0Poor girl had to balance four burgers, four portions of fries and a portion of buffalo wings, plus some shopping, on her ten minute walk back to the office. \u00a0Here's an easy one for the Meat Liquor guys: if you're gonna offer 'takeout', might be worth offering something to 'take-it-out' in... Like a carrier bag, perhaps.Rant over. To the food: the burgers are good. Patty is rough-chopped, if that's your thing, thick and cooked medium. The fillings nice enough: perfect amount of cheese, onion, ketchup, lettuce (good butter lettuce rather than McD's-style cheapo iceberg) and pickle. \u00a0The bread slightly sweet and on the chewy side -- a good thing in my view as it means the bun doesn't crumble or dissolve when saturated with the (substantial) 'jus' and grease from the meat patty. \u00a0The fries are skinny (hallelujah!) and, in our case, slightly too undercooked in not-quite-hot-enough oil, hence a bit on the greasy side. The buffalo wings are not great. \u00a0I think they are broiled rather than deep-fried and not tossed properly in the hot sauce, resulting in a pale appendage with not much punch or flavour. \u00a0I mean, you're having burgers and fries so it's not like you're really watching the calories. \u00a0Just deep-fry the damn things!Portions are ENORMOUS. \u00a0One portion of fries will generously feed two and there must've been about 15 drumlets in the buffalo wings portion. You know what. \u00a0This place is good for a city that has never really done the burger thing properly or cheaply. Meat Liquor is pretty cheap and it offers a generous feed. If my colleague's experience is anything to go by, it's also a good place to get chatted up and offered drinks by single American male tourists who hang out at the bar (where 'takeout' also gets order from). \u00a0That's about it. All said and done, it's just a burger joint. Probably not worth the big queues... And lack of foresight into the paper-bag thing...one star less for that!",

    "text": "Honestly this place just might be my favourite burger place of all time! Considering the fact that I'm American, I have pretty high standards on burgers and this one hits the spot every single time! It's hard to find a good proper American burger in London and so far this is the only place I've found that can do that. The burgers are always nice and juicy and the fries are always hot! The queue can be quite ridiculous at times (I've once waited for two hours in 3 degree weather on a Friday night)... which tells me something though, because I wouldn't do that for any other restaurant I've ever been to. It can be quite loud due to the music and people so I probably wouldn't go on a first date there or anything. The bar is a bit pricey but then again what bar in Central London isn't? The food however is decently priced and you can get a burger and chips for about 10 pounds. In conclusion, I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger- as I'm not sure I'll ever find one anywhere as good as they are here!",

We were directed to the bar to wait for our table which is a nifty move as you spend more on drinks. Drinks were nice. We were directed to our table after about 15 mins. We were right at the back were it was very dark. This is the look of the restaurant (an a american dive bar), so not a problem but a bit disorientating in the middle of the day. Food arrived very swiftly and looked plentiful. We ordered dead hippie burgers, chilli fries and deep fried pickles. The latter was very nice but certainly not slimming. I was a little disappointed with the chilli fries, far too much cheese and not enough jalepenos. Burgers were moist but i have to admit, the sauce really reminded me of a big mac.

    "text": "Most reviews I've read have been fairly so-so about Meat Liquor but I would readily go there again. My first taste of Meatwagon burgers was at the Meateasy. While it was a good burger it did not make my list as the best ever. Today's burger (a dead hippy) was nothing short of fantastic; a delicious, sloppy burger, nicely pink on the inside and really without fault. Fantastic.I also enjoyed the deep fried pickles, they were nicer than expected (I mainly ordered them out of curiosity) and my only gripe here was that the portion could have been a bit more generous. The venue IMO has a more favourable layout than the Meateasy and the staff were brilliant. Although I had to wait a while for my burger and, as I was sitting at the bar, I at one point was being jostled by some suits, the food and the lovely staff more than made up for that all. I also had a quick chat with one of the owners and he seemed to genuinely care about what I thought of the food. Go, but go early lunchtime or early evening to avoid the queues.",

    "text": "What better way to start my long overdue foodie blog than with some meat and some liquor? Friday night saw my second visit to the celebrated resting place of the celebrated Meatwagon, its MEATliquor restaurant on Welbeck Street. After a less than enjoyable first visit before Christmas, I thought I had paid the place my last dues. My initiation was half tainted by understandably unenthusiastic companions (the parents!) and half by the type of hype surrounding the place that only anticipates disappointment (I'm not a hype type-a-gal). Above all, I wasn't crazy about the food. Not wanting to miss out on an evening with friends, however, I went along upon their suggestion.I arrived at the scene on Friday at 8:30pm to find a queue of epic proportions.Yes, it was testing and, yes, it was really cold and, yes, we did endure all 1.75 hours of it (!). I read one tweet that says it all: 'MEATliquor is harder to get into than a nun's knickers.' I have always been inclined to view such queues as purely bad things (I'm not a queue type-a-gal). Thinking outside of my brainbox, however, and I realise a queue as long as this could signal something spectacular at the end. Could it be that I missed something the first time around? Could there be a juicy pot of gold at the end of the giant rainbow?Well, juicy - yes, but golden - not exactly. One enters MEATliquor to find a square room defined by a square arcade that forms a slightly sunken central floor area and seating all around. The ceiling above is domed and adorned with what looks like a rock'n'roll mess of red, white and black. The darkness is almost as heavy as the food. The d\u00e9cor is almost as loud as the music. The room extends in front of you to accommodate a bar area with extra seating towards the back. On both occasions I was seated downstairs, a little offshoot with four sizeable tables. The threshold of the staircase that leads you down here is distinguished by PVC strip curtains smothered in red paint, palpably suggestive of a butcher's and emphasising the meat part of the experience, along with a momentary stench of synthetics as you pass through.Our charmingly chatty waitress brought our food out fairly quickly. The starter tray consisted of deep fried pickles, Buffalo wings, chilli cheese fries and a pork slider. The pickles were a unanimous favourite, tangy and fleshy on the inside and complimented by the crunchy battered crust. The blue cheese dip accentuated the deliciousness of this simple, yet satisfying, offering. Second favourite were the chilli cheese fries, which was essentially just a bowl of irresistible ingredients piled on top of each other, and a generous portion of them too. To quote Joey Tribiani: cheese? Good. Minced beef? Good. Fries? Good. Spice? Goooood!The burgers were how I remember them: a chunky patty of ground beef cooked all the way through. I prefer my burgers slightly pink in the middle, but the meat was still tasty and the bun was soft and squidgy, almost brioche-like. Put together with a base of gherkins, onions and lettuce with cheese on top, the burger is indeed satisfying. For the particularly ravenous, I suggest the Dead Hippie: a double patty burger with special sauce. My issue with MEATliquor's main offering, however, is that it is so oily that your hands will be bathing in a pool of grease by the time you are done. I washed my hands five times, just to be sure (I may be an OCD type-a-gal). With finger food like this, served on a paper-covered metal tray, they should also invest in providing wet wipes, if only to minimise grease-spreading. Each table offers several kitchen towel rolls, but this only goes so far. In fact, each condiment bottle is smeared in its own coating of MEATliquor oil. The fries are also extremely salty, even for me.For desserts we ordered a slice of crack pie and another topped with cream. The crack pie was delicious, with a chewy caramel-like filling nestled in a crumbly cookie crust.MEATliquor brings a New York-style grungy diner experience to London. It is specifically reminiscent of Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridian on West 57th Street. The emphasis here is on the word experience. As one of my companions noted, it is not just a restaurant satisfying your hunger or a watering hole quenching your thirst. It is a complete assault on all five of your senses. It is also more of a trend thing than a taste thing. The burger itself does not make my All Star list and still does not live up to the hype. Even if I did cherish the culinary contributions, the prospect of queuing each time (expect queues from 7pm each day, apparently) scuppers any chance of repeat visits.I do encourage you to try it it if you haven't, but I wouldn't be surprised if your first time is also your last.",

    "text": "If you had the good fortune to visit #meateasy in New Cross in the early months of 2011 you might find Meat Liquor a little bit of a let-down. However, as Hunter himself sort of said: \"the kind of peak that never comes again. New Cross in early 2011 was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words, food, music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . . \" We rocked up at Meat Liquor on a Friday night around 6pm hoping to beat the queue and sure enough we walked straight in and had our choice of tables. Feeling a little bit sensitive after a long hard week we grabbed a table in the slightly quieter area at the back of the restaurant to the left of the bar \u00a0this would be a good spot if you are with a large party. The trademark literary 'wallpaper' from the New Cross venue was in place and the dim red lighting, excellent soundtrack and somewhat scatty service made this all feel very familiar despite the new location in the heart of the beast. We kicked off our evening with a selection of cocktails from the very inviting, well-priced drinks menu. As before these well put-together concoctions came in jam jars and really hit the spot. I particularly liked the novel take on the Negroni while the House Grog was a very tasty rum based creeper which is sensibly limited to a maximum order of two per person \u00a0not sure the good Doctor would have approved of this bit of nannying though. We teamed our drinks up with the already legendary deep-fried pickles, which \u00a0trust me on this one- no trip to Meat Liquor should be without. Suitably lubricated we were now ready for our burgers and despite the carnage around us in the fast filling restaurant we managed to get the attention of a charming burgerette and place our order. Half an hour later we were deep into burger heaven. My chilli burger was just lovely with plenty of heat and a great charred patty packing plenty of flavour. I tried a small bite of B's chilli chicken burger and for one brief moment had a touch of the food envy. Our dining companions, big Phil and the delightful Kate (who had been mistaken for a stripper from the club next door) were also swooning over their choices and comparing the Meat Liquor offering very favourably with the burgers they had enjoyed during the summer at The Rye. The side dishes, and in particular the fries, are a big improvement on the New Cross days. The slaw was very tasty and for those folk who don't get what this place is all about, there is a red neon sign bearing the legend meat over the front door, you even have a small rabbit food section on the menu. We washed all this meaty goodness down with some fine wine from the short but well put together and reasonably priced wine list. Not sure I noticed it on our visit but anywhere with wine by the awesome Charles Smith on the wine list gets a big thumbs up from me. We left at some point around 9pm well fed, with our wallets intact and glad we were not in the ever growing queue of foodie hipsters snaking their way down the street. This year has seen me on a bit of a burger pilgrimage around the capital and Meat Liquor is definitely top five in my book. This dark, dirty, sexy dive of a place will definitely not be too everyone's taste but we are already planning a return visit in the New Year.",

Being a big fan of blue cheese, I was disappointed with the tiny bit of blue cheese on top and it was \u00a36! \u00a0The burgers are tasty but a little on the small side.

    "text": "So disappointing!! I have wanted to try Meat Liquor in forever and so was happy there was a restaurant nearby when out shopping. First impressions - that place is dark!! Luckily we were sat in a window seat so we could see our food. Following the advice of fellow Yelpers I went for the Dead Hippie, 2 French mustard beef patties and a portion of fries. Other people in my party had the cheeseburger and the chicken finger sandwich. I found my burger to be very moist, and juicy but in a bad way. It was a bit of a mess to eat actually and this isn't barbecue or pulled pork, so I didn't expect it. Maybe that's their thing, but I didn't rate the burger and have had much better burgers elsewhere. I also wasn't very impressed with the look of my friends chicken finger sandwich, it is served on white bread and it didn't look appetizing at all. My friend and I got a portion of fries each and I would definitely say you could share one portion between two as there was plenty. The food is served on a tray, like barbecue food is normally served, which I normally don't mind but when your food is dripping, it is difficult when you are sharing one tray between three not to get it everywhere.After my visit I kind of felt content that I hadn't been missing out all these years, like I thought I was as I hadn't visited Meat Liquor. I probably wouldn't object if someone I was with really wanted to eat there again, but I probably wouldn't seek it out myself to try again, there are too many options out there to try! Also it isn't the cheapest either, for the amount you get.",

    "text": "I've eaten at all the branches of the restaurant in London bar the Chicken place in Brixton, plus the good old Meat Easy, not to mention the original (well the second one) Wagon. So I'm used to the food by now, and that's one of the reasons why I keep coming back. Because if I started my experience with Meat Liquor then I probably wouldn't continue - since it's like walking into a darkened cupboard when you get inside. Thankfully on this occasion, we were seated over by the bar, so we had a little bit more ambient light than normal and direct access to the servers as they walked past (they're often difficult to attract in the permanent gloom). Having eaten here a fair few times, I've discovered that the best thing on the menu isn't actually the burgers - it's the monkey fingers. Seriously, if you like buffalo chicken, then you'll find that these are probably the best on the planet. Crunchy yet soft, with plenty of batter to act as a buffalo sauce delivery system to your tastebuds.I also tried the hippie fries for the first time - warning - do not order these on your own. The portion is so large that you'll never even look like you've dented them. You get a big dish of fries with runs of sauce and caramelised onions throughout. They're now on my list for when I'm not dining alone.As I said, the service here is usually hit and miss - but today was a hit. We got a good server, who was totally on the ball all the time. So good, that despite my policy of not tipping in the UK, I actually did leave a tip on this occasion.",

This is the closest thing I've found - to a very good one of those in the UK.It has a very good selection. Unless you're a veggie. But then you wouldn't be coming in probably. Anyway.I had the Dead Hippie Burger, Braai Wings and some onion rings. Washed down with a house grog. House grog they say, will only be served to you twice...think Zombie and you won't be far wrong. Pineapple, and lots of rum.All the food turned up at once on a tray, simple and effective. If you want a comparison for the burger, I'd say it's like an In-n-out California style double pattie job. Cooked the way I like it already (red in the middle) and served on a brioche bun, with pickles cheese and some tasty sauce.The onion rings were huge. Thick batter and a great amount of actual onion - not those reconstituted things you find at some places.The braii wings.Had I eaten one first, I think I would have just ordered a whole plate full. There's four of them, but they're a full wing, so it's like eight of your standard \"takeaway\" wings. BBQ'd and dry rubbed with an amazing spice mix - with an incredible dip.Meal was just under \u00a330 all in, tip and \u00a31 charity donation.Music was right up my street (rock and not too loud!) interior is...also. Dark, black and red with a host of pin up connotations.Servers and staff were all amazing.I'll be back. And then again. And probably again.",

This is the only location that I'd ever been to and the food was amazing every time. Honestly, some of the best food I've ever eaten and definitely in my top five for food in London. The food is served tray-style/family-style. It's really easy to taste your friends food this way. ;) I was really obsessed with their chicken sandwich. It' called the \"Tower Block Burger\". It has a fried chicken filet with cheese, hash brown, jalapenos, slaw, onions and a Russian dressing. By far the best chicken burger of my entire life. You will leave ML with a food baby and that is ok!! Also really love the deep fried mac & cheese and dead hippie burger. They have a nice bar + great drinks as well. This food really is SO good it should be a sin. Love Meatliquor forever and ever.P.S. They play super loud music, so not the best for a first date, get to know someone kind of thing.

The fries also weren't very good. I think they had been sitting out quite a while because when they got to me they were stale and lukewarm. Service wasn't great either, I had to flag down a waitress when my waiter disappeared. I definitely won't go back, even if it was an off day their consistency clearly leave a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "So, I'd been wanting to go here for a few months after hearing rave reviews and the hype surrounding the place and its humble street-food beginnings. There was a queue when we arrived (Saturday night) though it was moving surprisingly fast. I could imagine it would get to be pretty annoying were it for any longer than we waited (about 40 mins). They have a quite strict queueing system, which means you cannot hold places for people in your group, which is actually something of a good idea but goes to show this places' popularity. Once inside, you're greeted with a wall of sound, both from the blazing speakers pumping out 50's rock'n'roll and from the bar and tables of the punters themselves. This is definitely not a place to come to quietly pass the time with a burger and fries. This is party-time! And a very well organised party at that. The atmosphere is, for want of a better word, hedonistic, in that you feel as though you've stumbled into some little-known underground speakeasy where the clientel are making the most of its secrecy. The thing of course is that everyone now knows of this place, so I'm impressed at how they've managed to keep the vibe goingThey also have the novel addition of a photo booth which takes surprisingly good quality pictures, definitely a big bonus for any group night out. We were seated within about 15 minutes of arriving and had the change to get in some photo booth time, a pint of 'house grog' (excellent) and a shot at the bar. The menu is nice and simple, a few variations on the burger, 2 hot dogs, fried, onion rings etc Nothing looked overly expensive and I suspect that they offset keeping the food reasonable by charging well for the booze. We ordered a burger each (4 of us), a Chilli Dog, Chilli & Cheese fries and Onion Rings to share. Definitely plenty of food and a good rounded selection from the menu.Burgers are king and all were cooked excellently medium rare (no option given when ordered). The Chilli Dog was ok but not outstanding. Chilli * Cheese fries, however, were my standout of the night. Lovely melted Jack cheese top and a VERY good (and seemingly house made) chilli, which was so moreish and memorable I wanted it the next morning for breakfast. The 4 of us spent a total of \u00a3140. At \u00a335 a piece I thought it quite good as we weren't bothered about the bill going in.All in all a really fun, filling and thoroughly enjoyable night out. Highly recommend going at least once to this one of a kind pig-out palace!",

Apparently Patty and Bun is good too, but as Bodeans has been a twin birthday venue for some years I'm biased to their way of 'cue.",

    "text": "The Englishman brought me to MeatLiquor a year ago. We weren't impressed then, and I'm less impressed now. If you sign up on their website, you can get a free drink before April 30th. Seeing this, I thought it would be a nice treat if we went back to MeatLiquor knowing what to fully expect this time. Shout out to Camie T. for her review. It's spot on, although her experience was worse than ours. She has described the experience and the food to a T. Now I understand why somewhere so popular is tempting people to come in for a free drink.First, there is always a 45-60 minute queue to get in. Wouldn't be as bad if the queue wasn't lined with rubbish bins. However, this time they brought out a tray of onion rings and deep fried pickles to munch on while you're waiting (Take heed: I watched a girl DOUBLE DIP in the blue cheese sauce at the beginning of the line and the guy continued serving the dip to the rest of the line. GROSS. Don't try the dip unless you order it yourself. This goes to show, never trust public food.) They do have outdoor heaters to make the wait a bit more enjoyable. Usually, you have to wait an hour outside and at least half an hour in the bar to get a seat. We lucked out last night and were seated immediately after waiting outside, as we were a party of 2. There were still loads of people waiting at the door and the bar.It is way too dark and way too loud. Last year, I thought this was cool. This year, I was sitting directly next to the Englishman at bar style seating, and we had to shout into each other's ear to have a conversation. Thank God we weren't seated in a booth, we'd have to text to communicate. This is all part of the \"I don't give a s**t\" attitude that Meat Liquor projects. This attitude can only work to certain degree before customers start getting fed up with being treated like nothing. It even says so on the menu (something to the effect of you can have what you want on your burger, followed by \"I don't care.\"), followed by a line at the bottom saying don't be embarrassed to ask for your order to be fixed. Sounds like maybe they might actually care a little, eh? Nope. See below.This is where we start to have issues. Upon being seated, the Englishman went to the bar to use our vouchers. 15 minutes later he comes back empty handed, as you must order the drink from a set menu that the server has. Okay, that was fine - a bit frustrating, but fine. We didn't expect much for free. During that time, I saved our table and spent the entire time trying to figure out who our server was. None of the servers made eye contact with customers. No one came over. Nothing. Finally, thirty minutes after being seated, we managed to call our server over (well, we think she was our server... it's not like she introduced herself or anything). After explaining we had the voucher, she asked what drink we would like. We ordered and we told blankly that we could only have a Donkey Punch. Sorry, what was the point of asking us what drink we wanted if we could only have the one? My second issue, is that the Donkey Punch is a drink priced at \u00a37.50. There are other drinks priced for \u00a37.50 that we asked if we could switch for something of the same price, only to be told in a \"I don't give a s**t\" attitude, \"No.\" That's fine, we tried something new and drank the Donkey Punch and then ordered the drinks we were hoping for. That attitude remained for the rest of the interactions (few and far between as they were with our server). Rude.We ordered a chilli cheeseburger, the mushroom swiss burger and chicken wings, a Zombie and a Game Over to share. It came to about \u00a320 for each of us. My issue with Meat Liquor is not the food. I really enjoyed the chilli cheeseburger and the Englishman said he really enjoyed his meal. However, our issue lies with the service. Our server never came over at any point after ordering. She wasn't around. She never checked in with us. We had to get her attention every time. When we got the bill, it included an expected service change. We were offended that we were expected to pay this after being neglected for the entire time we were there. I realize that they made this mandatory, as the attitude of the servers means if tipping was optional, they wouldn't get anything. While we were debating this charge, our server came over twice within a few minutes to get the payment. She wasn't around the whole time, yet she was like a hawk when it came to taking our money. We asked our server if it was mandatory to pay this and she was genuinely offended that we didn't want to pay it. She asked why and when we gave the first reason (of many more to follow) she seemed genuinely disinterested and non-apologetic, took our money and left without a word. Usually, in other restaurants when all the servers seem to be genuinely disinterested, the cause usually lies with poor management. I won't be going back again.",

    "text": "The dead hippie - not bad, basically a homage to an in and out animal style burger. It's a solid a burger for London, but a bit on the greasy side. The buffalo chicken burger was super spicy, a fried chicken filet drowning in spicy buffalo sauce. I really wasn't expecting it but this chicken burger definitely had a kick. \u00a0Don't know if I would get it again though... reminded me of a very spicy, but not as tasty chik filet sandwich. The chili cheese fries were meh. Their chili to fry ratio was totally off - it was practically 2/3 chili (not very good chili, more like dried ground beef and chili powder), 1/3 fries, and waaaayyyyy too many jalepenos. It tasted too tangy, not the typical chili cheese fries plate you'd find back home in the states. The drinks were actually decent! If I come back I'm just getting a burger, the donkey punch (like a moscow mule) and that grog punch thingie (awesome punch with light and dark rum). \u00a0The bartender was actually very helpful and explained some of the drinks, we tipped him as if we were back in NYC.The waiter on the other hand - not so much. He didn't care to take our order, give us any utensils, or bring us a bill. \u00a0It all seemed very much for him. Lastly, I don't get the long queue outside. It seemed a bit like they actually wanted to keep a queue for appearances and such. \u00a0After waiting for about 45 minutes and being at the front of the queue, I saw 4 or 5 empty tables. \u00a0On top of that, they were ushering people from the line to the bar first, making you order drinks and waiting there for an additional 20 minutes, and then seating you. \u00a0It all seemed very counter-productive and aimed at two goals: 1. keeping a line outside for hype; and 2. \"encouraging\" patrons to buy a few drinks after being frustrated with the long wait outside. Will I return? Maybe... sans the pre-meditated queue and the waiter who doesn't want to wait tables.",

Thought the service was passable and was a bit miffed when the lady tending to the queue would not accept my provisional licence as proof of age...! She then proceed to tell me they only accept Passports wtf! I got in just because everyone else around me has 'suitable' ID on them.I had the Dead Hippie burger and enjoyed every little bit of it! Slightly in the greasy drip side but I guess that's the nature of the food. I didn't like how the whole tables' meal comes on one tray, authentic or not I think it's a tad cheap. Expecting the plates to come next, which they didn't, which I thought was cool with although they could have stocked up on the kitchen paper. Another thing that bugged me is how badly lit the place was. I couldn't tell whether my burger was cooked how I like it or not. A lot of people had been raving on about their Chilli Cheese Fries, I thought they put a little too much mustard on and the fries went soggy after a few minutes. The Onion Rings were amazing (I did order Fried Pickles also, however the waitress never heard me). I washed it all down with a Coke Float which I absolutely adored! We did attempt to order some Crack Pie but they'd run out...!I will visit this place again, hopefully after the hype has died. I think some of the staff are a little hyped up on how 'cool' their place of work is, they could possibly concentrate on better service. All in all it's nice to see a decent burger joint in Central London.",

    "text": "No Children after 6pm was the sign that greeted us. LOL, love it! The four of us immediately thought, wow what kind of place are we about to enter for lunch. I'd heard about this place and it was a burger must try. Once there I event messaged a fellow yelper, Kevin after reading his review which I found helpful. Thanks Kevin. So our lunch experience began, at the bar. Bloody Mary showed up and that girl was SPICY (almost regretfully so!) but we survived. The bartender said 'ok look, we're known for our Chili Cheese Fries and Onion Rings so you've got to try them' and we did. Ok, good and interesting as far as CCF go. I consider myself a connoisseur in the chili cheese fries department however I've never had them with mustard loaded on them. Not bad, probably not the best but it didn't stop all of us from devouring the entire serving. The onion rings were fantastic and my choice of the Mushroom and Swiss burger was good and MESSY. There's a reason all tables have a roll of paper towels on them. Sometimes the messier the better I say. At the end of lunch we sat and took in the interesting space and began to wonder why and just what happens after 6pm. Clearly I'll be returning to find out for myself just not alone. :)Inside you'll find red lighting accents among the dark spaces with a huge dome roof displaying graffiti style artwork. I'm sure the inspiration for the interior could be describe as punk rock and kick-ass with an edgy bar feel. So, be forewarned if you're not into communal eating and easily offended by graphic imagery and words on the wall this is not the place for you.The service was fair given the place was packed and perhaps I was a bit impatient for my Diet Coke to extinguish the fire set by the Bloody Mary. I believe this to be one of my best if not the best burger experience in London. Meat Liquor satisfied our cravings for a kick-ass burger in London and I can't wait to go again y'all, especially after 6pm.",

Service was erratic, much faster if you are proactive and get your own menus.The burgers are still great, but not amazing. Not sure if its atmosphere, they just do not taste as good as the very first time I tried them. Cocktail list is well priced and executed.Will probably return, but only if I know I can avoid the busier times. They currently are doing 90 covers but hope to increase it to 140.

Yes there was a queue even at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, but the wait wasn't bad and a smiley waiter brought a big tray of onion rings and fried pickles out to the waiting masses which was very sweet! We were shown straight to the bar once we reached the front of the queue and tried a very well prepared cocktail (reasonably priced) before finally getting a table. We ordered wings (crispy and very well seasoned - not the drippy kind of buffalo wings you normally find), bacon cheeseburger (nice big patty - but I thought it was a bit dry and the bread a little stale), Philly cheesesteaks (great amount of meat and well seasoned) and coleslaw and fries. We enjoyed the grungy but slightly loud atmosphere but not the waiting to grab a waitress to pay and leave. Overall though it's somewhere I'd def like to go back. I've yet to find better wings in London!",

Extremely crowded and loud (on Saturday night). Not that I'm surprised by that, but if you want a relaxing dinner out then this is not the place. It's a huge hipster joint.3. Waitress (when she was able to come since the place was massively understaffed) was nice and took our order. However, we were not given plates to eat off of but instead the three of us had to eat off of one trey while sitting at a bar table, so lots of inconvenient passing and reaching over each other was required.4. This was what really sent me over the edge: I was thirsty after their ridiculously greasy and salty burger, so I asked a waiter if I could have some water. He honestly looked me in the eye, frowned at me as if to say \"seriously?\" and then walked right over to the bar (about 2m away from us) and got HIS OWN glass of water to drink right in front of me!The fried pickles were really good, but the fries were mediocre at best, as was the burger. The meat is of average quality and they don't have anything creative to offer on the menu (if you're only going to make bacon & cheese, cheese, and swiss & mushroom burgers then you'd better do them a hell of a lot better than Meat Liquor does them). I mean, their whole business is based on branding by wrapping themselves up in a \"cool\" package (and not on the quality of service and food), so why not add some burgers that have \"alternative\" ingredients for customers to enjoy yet another layer of unnecessary glitz?I'm sorry but playing loud music, adorning your walls with alternative \"art\" and saddling customers with some pathetic no-nonsense schtick (making them wait outside because reservations are forbidden, not bringing them plates or water, making them wait FOREVER to get a waiter's attention or food for that matter) is way below my standard. I guess people like this place because it seems so exclusive, new, and hip but the fad will eventually wear off. At least I hope so for the sake of good service.",

I don't think it's fair to pressure peoples into paying towards a charity they don't know enough about and well putting them on the spot charity is to be given not taken.

But the dead hippy burger, in all the meat drippings was JUST.SO.GOOD. Can't even. Just try it. I don't know what dead hippy sauce is but it is good. The wings were also faultless, it actually came with a tub of sauce, but that wasn't necessary, the marinade on the wings alone was tasty by itself. (IN YOUR FACE COLONEL SANDERS) The chilli cheese fries beat us though, it was just too much. Probably just stick to the normal fries next time. (I did give it a great shot-man vs food style, but it was just too mammoth.) I'm a bit peeved with myself that i didn't beat the food so that's why its only 4 stars. So it's a bit pricy for a burger, but in comparison to GBK or even Byron, it's actually a little bit cheaper (Byron's are just under tenner, I think!) But SO worth it.You'll bet I'll be back...(Went here for lunch so service wasn't so bad)",

Not \"oh, this is nice low lighting\", more \"oh, it's so dark in here it's almost depressing\". It was 6.30pm when I arrived and it felt like I'd just time travelled to 3am.When our table was ready, the waiter tried to seat us at the uncomfortable bar stools instead of at one of the free tables. So, we had to call him back and ask to be moved. Why didn't he just give us the more comfortable option to start with?Meat Liquor is a little up it's own ass. You can tell that from the huge signs all over the place that put you in your place. Telling you that they won't seat you unless your whole party is there and various other rules and regulations. The type of thing that happens when restaurants become too successful for their own good. You quickly realise that \"the customer is always right\" is not something they're going to subscribe to here. Some of the staff have a \"don't give a s**t what you think\" air about them.It's also one of those places that deliberately makes people queue outside to attract attention, despite the fact there's space inside. One of our friends arrived at the end of our meal to have a quick drink with us. But they wouldn't let him in - despite the fact there was loads of space inside. It's nice and friendly that way.The burgers? Well, they're OK - nothing amazing. One thing I did love though were the frozen beer glasses - that's always a nice touch. Going back?

    "text": "I don't get it.After all the hype, for a burger bar, one can only presume it's worth checking out to see what's so great. Now I've been I still don't know. All I gathered was disappointment and a feeling of being just another curious beastie suckered in to the latest fad. Don't believe the hype.The bad start I was expecting - the queue. Bookings aren't taken here. A decent restaurant will give you an approximate waiting time and the option to wait at the bar or come back at an allotted time. The only function of maintaining a queue is an extension of what this place thrives on - hype. It makes Meat Liquor look heavily sought after and this lures others in to wondering what it's all about. We ambled along in the afternoon, so just the 15 minute wait to get inside. Then we discover that there are no tables free so we have to wait at the bar anyway and pay too much for drinks.Aside from their marketing ploys and ability to save money where ever possible, nothing about this place is impressive. The chairs are very much like the rickety, old, uncomfortable school chairs. We had the stools from the science labs. No napkins here at Meat Liquor, you make do with the kitchen roll on every table as your napkin and/or plate as when your burger does (eventually, ours took an unfathomable age) arrive, it doesn't matter how many of you there are, everything will be dumped on one tray and left in between the diners to scramble over and to drag what's yours away. Completely unhelpful and just smacks of cheap inadequacy.The lights are unnecessarily dim and the music is too loud for conversations across a table without raising ones voice to a near shout.THE BURGERS! What everybody raves about! Why? They're just burgers. Good burgers are available in many places. The burgers here are good but certainly not worth any kind of hassle or special effort. My burger was particularly... burgery. Nice though (just nice) and the only reason Meat Liquor receives as much as two stars - for performing it's primary function.I even took issue with the decor. They've opted for, somewhat predictably, a distressed, hipster look which conveniently complies with their desire to spend as little money as possible, furnishing the place with what ever people were going to throw away, unfinished decorating and a general held-together-with-tape look to much of the establishment. Probably why it's so dark inside. The walls and ceiling look a little like an art students first attempt at quirky graffiti.More to complain about - the staff - they're rubbish. Each one we had to deal with carried their own over-inflated sense of self importance but commit fully to applying a lax attitude towards whoever happens to be in the restaurant at the time. Not that they'd be likely to notice you anyway. I'd like to comment on the quality of Liquor (cocktails they offer, apparently) but that's difficult as we had trouble trying to order some. We spent a while trying to gain the attention of someone who \"works\" there but after a time gave up and decided to try our luck elsewhere. Then it took a while to get the bill, of course.Oh, and they use old jam jars as glasses. There is very little about this place and it's attempts at being hip that doesn't irritate me.Why bother?TTFN,Ian",

    "text": "Oooh, if I look at this place as somewhere I just wandered into during a shopping trip to refuel I reckon it's pretty good. When I look at it as a restaurant which has been flogged to death and pulled apart with such positive overhyped reviews I reckon it is A-OK.The burgers are decent, fairly greasy, but tasty! I've never had a chicken buffalo burger before, it was Fan Fucking Tastic! \u00a0Crisp outside, smothered in (Franks?) hot sauce, with a nice warmish soft & fresh bun...I wanted it for breakfast the next morning...I want it now....The Dead Hippy was delish too, reminded me of an In n Out burger.....only more expensive. I'd be willing to pay that every now and then for a In in Out fix!The sides were so so, don't think I'd bother with them again (oh except for the coleslaw, that was nice). They were bland and greasy (onion rings & fried pickles - na).The drinks were nice - sticking with the trend of being served in jam jars.Staff were friendly, the place is loud, but not too loud (could still hold a conversation).The thing I just don't get is the queue...we arrived at 5:30pm, no queue, but when we left at around 8pm, faaark!! There were about 100 people queuing! We weren't rushed out, the turnover over of tables was low and slow, I reckon they enjoy having the queue outside - adds to the hype..... that I just don't get......That being said, overall, great burgers, but not amazing enough to merit queuing for hours....",

    "text": "Does exactly what it says on the tin, er, sign. Meat and Liquor. Love the notice on their menu that reads 'No Liquor without Meat'. Thankfully as we visited on a Friday lunchtime we only required the meat, although many other people seemed to be celebrating the arrival of the weekend with both...Having been told how busy it can get I was relieved that when we showed up at 11:45am we only waited a few minutes to be seated. Once inside the service was a little spotty but to be fair they went from being empty to full in five minutes so I suppose that might have been expected.While we waited for our burgers (we skipped the fries as we were feeling virtuous) the decor of this cool space offered plenty to keep us occupied. We spent many minutes admiring the murals, 'blood' spattered walls and ceilings and multiple slogans carefully graffitied across the place. I'll be honest, there was a small part of me which felt a little old to be here...and I have no doubt that on a Friday night when the music's pumping and the liquor is flowing I would feel extremely out of place. That said the burgers were excellent and it was a fun lunchtime stop so it served us well.I had the bacon cheeseburger (to compare it with the Burger & Lobster one I'd had earlier in the week) which was decent and very reasonably priced (especially compared to the Burger & Lobster one!). But my boyfriend had the Green Chili Cheeseburger which was excellent. Just enough spice to make your lips tingle but juicy and tasty.I enjoyed the no plates, kitchen roll instead of napkins and burgers served on a platter thing. They are clearly going low-brow and too cool for cutlery thing which is fitting given the decor. Next time, and I will definitely be going back, I think I'd like to try the cheese fries and maybe a hot dog, and perhaps if I'm feeling young enough a cocktail!",

And now Meat Liquor.After queuing for an hour (and that was a SHORT queue from 6pm on a Tuesday night), I was led inside. The music was loud. The servers were hip. The decor was more East London than it was Marylebone.Our table was in the little downstairs area. The server was WOEFUL. She was entirely too friendly and chatty. If I've waited 15 minutes for you to even acknowledge my existence and take my order, I certainly don't want you to then go to the next table, nattering away and indulging these drunken diners by looking at pictures of god-knows-what on their BlackBerry. I want you to put in my goddamn drink order, at least. I've waited 1 hour and 30 minutes at this point, for fuck's sake. GET ME SOME BOOZE.The cheeseburger was good. I'll give it that.But the deep fried pickles I got as a starter were so unnecessarily greasy that they, in fact, left both me and my dining companion with a stomach ache for the rest of the night. I assume it was the pickles, at least. I certainly hope it wasn't the cheeseburger, since it's kind of Meat Liquor's entire thing - burgers.I'm not sold on the combination of cocktails and burgers, either. It wasn't good. The cocktail was adequate. The burger was excellent. But cocktails do not complement greasy burgers. Stop fooling yourself, people.I'm not sure how or why this place is so popular. I certainly wouldn't wait in that queue for this again, no.",

Once we got in we realised that we had only reached the end of the queue for the bar area! It was then another 15mins or so before we sat down. But there was another girl who arrived at the same time as me.. all her friends were inside and they even saved her a seat and they make her join the back of the queue as well, which I thought was a bit much!In regards to the food, I was probably the least impressed with the burgers out of everything we got... we got the cheesy fries which were really good.. but quite massive. They were like nacho chips with chilli con carne, but with fries instead of corn chips! Spicy wings which was also good - the sauce on the actual wings were good, but the dipping sauce was a bit bland and wasn't blue cheesy enough for my liking. The crack pie for dessert was also yummy, nice and caramelly and a good way to end a massive meal! Think there's also just been so much hype about the burgers that my expectations were really high.. and just didn't quite reach it. I thought the burger meat was a lil dry and just didn't have enough meaty oomphf.. esp the signature dead hippy burger.. the green chilli one was better, both in terms of meat and the sauce. I also thought the place was a bit pretentious - place made to look old but wasn't really, unnecessarily dark for a burger joint, really loud music and \"graffiti\" on the wall but done by designers/ artists rather than something done spontaneously.",

If what you're looking for is a bandwagon to catch when it's already 7 miles out of town, then I can't really help.

Inside it is very dark and very loud (apparently they have their own 24/7 radio station with random music) and not very clear what you have to do. Some people do have to que at the bar, others are seated and can order there. The please must be great for groups, because you can sit, drink and shout all that you want.There were only 2 beers on the menu, which is very disappointing. They come in cans and a frozen glass. The glass was very nice, keeps the beer nice and chilled.The burger I ordered was the Cheese/Bacon medium rare. When I got the burger, it wasn't really medium rare, rather medium well and it had a very strong smoke taste. The bun was good, patty nice and thick (though a bit on the dry side) and the sauce ok. All and all an average burger which doesn't score very high on my 'best burger of the world list'.As a side I ordered the Chili Fries (with meat). This was a good option, I liked them a lot. Fries were nice and crisp (in the beginning) and the sauce and meat had a very nice flavour. This actually saved the meal, without the fries I would rated the place 2 stars.When I ordered a second beer, they messed up the order and I never received it. When I told the waitress she was great and took the first beer of the bill :)Would I go back: don't think soWould I recommend: If you are with a group looking for meet and drinks, maybe",

I wanted Meatliquor.We expected lines and were prepared to wait, but time flew. We were in line for 20 minutes but had fun talking to the other people around. Since we were a big group, we got divided into smaller groups since there wasn't a table big enough for 10 people. We didn't really mind though. I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of Meatliquor. Graffiti walls, blood splatters, grungey music, fishnets and laughter filled the whole place. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant under the dome that had these crazy animal murals painted on them. It was great. With nothing but paper towels to help me out, I knew it was about to get real. I had just ordered a cheeseburger because I'm a Plain Jane when it comes to my burgers along with some fries. They were both heavenly, greasy perfection. I knew my arteries would never be the same, but I enjoyed every last morsel of that dirty, grimy, slimy burger, as did everyone else who I was with. Meatliquor is an experience, one that I will never forget.",

(Although they do have 1-2 meat free options).We waited less than most people do, and although it felt a bit long, it was nice to stand at the bar and chat with friends. If you're in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Food wise it is greasy as all other reviews say, to the point where you are given a kitchen towel roll to wipe your hands and arms as the grease goes everywhere. My personal favourite was the Bingo Wings, and I would be happy to go there just to have those wings again. They are a must to try!It's not as expensive as you think it would be, with the burgers ranging from \u00a36.50 - \u00a39, and they are filling.All in all it is a nice experience with friends, but you need to have extra time on your hands, and be ready for some greasy hands as well.",

    "text": "*Sigh...*I wanted to love you, Meat Liquor. \u00a0You had so much promise. \u00a0I heard so many lovely things about you from other yelpers. \u00a0Why'd you have to go and break my heart?So everyone knows about the queue. \u00a0It's out of control. \u00a0But after several attempts at going to Meat Liquor, I finally had a friend with me who was willing to brave the line in the cold. \u00a0What they don't tell you, is that once you've waited in said line, making it through the doors, thinking you're about to be rewarded with meaty, cheesy goodness... you have to put your name on a list and wait at the bar. \u00a0Ugh!My name was finally called, and the gent leading us to our table stopped at another table on the way and had about a 2 minute conversation. \u00a0Um... did you forget you were in the middle of leading us somewhere? \u00a0Perhaps to a table where we could get food after waiting an hour and a half?Finally seated... where's a waiter? Um... hmm. \u00a05 minutes... 10 minutes... Oh look, that must be ALL THE WAITSTAFF watching/timing some guy doing the triple chili challenge! \u00a0How helpful! \u00a0One of the hostesses managed to make eye contact with me and asked if we were ready to order. \u00a0Sent a waiter over, who I assume was meant to be our waiter the whole night. \u00a0Didn't even say anything to us as we ordered. \u00a0Food comes out, friend's burger is incorrect. \u00a0Oh great. \u00a0Now we have to find our elusive waiter to tell him the order is wrong. \u00a0Or, maybe we'll have to wait five minutes, give up, and go hunt down some OTHER waiter to tell him. \u00a0Look. \u00a0Long story short, the service is abysmal. \u00a0Downright abysmal.As for the burger, I had the Dead Hippie, and well... it was a burger. \u00a0It was aiiiiiiiight. \u00a0I really don't have anything to say about it aside from that. \u00a0It was a burger, and it tasted decent, and hence the two stars. \u00a0I was SO delighted to see chili cheese fries on the menu. \u00a0SO DELIGHTED. \u00a0Hey, Meat Liquor? \u00a0Chili should not be sweet. \u00a0Not. \u00a0Ever.*double sigh...*",

    "text": "Let's just get this out of the way. \u00a0If there is a better burger in London than the Dead Hippie burger at Meat Liquor, I'm going to be stunned. \u00a0While I'm not going as far as one of my ex-pat friends who claimed it was better than burgers in Texas (blasphemy and inaccurate to boot), Meat Liquor's burger is surprisingly good. \u00a0Deliciously juicy, the burger is dripping with a homemade mayo based sauce that intensifies the flavor of the meat. \u00a0Most people who like this eatery state you should order the Dead Hippie burger. \u00a0I tend to agree with the masses on this one. \u00a0It's a legitimately good burger. \u00a0As my friend Kevin L. mentioned, the liquor menu here leaves a bit to be desired. \u00a0They weren't even able to make the drink that I attempted to order off their menu claiming they were \"out\" of the right ingredients. \u00a0While normally this wouldn't bother me, Meat Liquor had been open for no more than 2 hours that day. \u00a0They serve for another 6-8 hours. \u00a0So either they have an enormous sourcing issue or they are being untruthful. \u00a0Both conclusions are negative. \u00a0Having said all that, I ended up ordering a non-alcoholic shake, and it was delicious. \u00a0So if you get a burger and shake, you'll probably be happy. \u00a0I would avoid the chili cheese fries. \u00a0When I claim that I miss Tex-Mex, people wonder how anyone can screw up beef, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sour cream, and guacamole combinations. \u00a0Some would make the same claim about chili cheese fries. \u00a0Meat Liquor makes chili cheese fries like people not from Texas makes Tex-Mex. \u00a0If you still want to order the fries, do so at your own peril. \u00a0You've been warned. \u00a0The atmosphere at Meat Liquor is some odd mixture of bordello and goth. \u00a0If this was supposed to remind me of the States, it failed. \u00a0In the end, all that really matters is that Meat Liquor has satisfying good burgers that have the ability to suppress the craving for dead cow. \u00a0They sufficiently pass that test so 4 big ole Yelp stars for them.",

    "text": "It's a long wait for a burger and fries. It does feel like a rock 'n roll nightclub inside, though. They have greasy versions of everything, and you can get a \"Philly Cheesesteak\" version of everything. The wings aren't bad, the burger are pretty solid, and the drinks are outstanding. Try the apricot jam.I was nauseous after eating here.As an American, I love these kinds of places, because they are caricatures of America. For the Brits, it's novelty. For me, it's just plain old American marketing.",

    "text": "So this place is cool. Not like I think it is cool (which I do), but like, this place knows it is cool, wears cool like a coat and would not be caught dead with uncool staff or uncool music or uncool anything, ever.And that is why you line up outside for an hour.The food is like super greasy late-night munchy food, and I do not say that as a bad thing. Deep fried pickles, and cheesey onion fries are an essential side order, and your whole meal is served up on a tray for the whole table, no plates here. If Man Vs Food did a UK version, he would definitely do a bit in Meat & Liquor. So do not be expecting gourmet lean beef patties or anything. The cocktail offering is amazing, but the names of the cocktails are wildly offensive in an attempt to be edgy. I hated myself for ordering a 'Donkey Punch'.Visit for the atmosphere, not for the fine dining, but give it a go all the same.",

    "text": "Ok so I convinced my mates to queue for up to 2 hours for a burger. I told them magical stories of wonderful burgers to rival any in LA and they fell for it. We went, we queued and lets just say things got a little tense. We were hungry, half-drunk and impatient. We had a stamp on our wrists that simply said FOOD but we hadn't had a sniff of anything for an hour. We finally got inside and went over to the bar where we experienced the most awful foulness ever imaginable. Don't remember the name but it was a bottle of cider (the only cider) and I nearly went home. The beers weren't much better either. Actually they didn't even have beer just some crappy lager charged at 4.5 quid. It wasn't looking good.We got to our table and was greeted with the most miserable waitress ever who got the hump at just a few questions. Then she said she wasn't having a good day and went off. Listen darling I'm not having a good year but I still smile and have (some) manners.Anyway the food finally came on a large metal tray which amused us and we tucked in. The cheeseburger I ordered was damn good, in fact it was one of the best I had since my return from LA. We ordered a bunch of sides with mixed feelings. The fries were way to salty, the slaw had no flavour but the onion rings were the dogs. Best rings in town and cut like a car tyre. Good reports about the mushroom Swiss burger my mates had. All in all a good experience as the atmosphere was pretty fun and I liked the rock n roll soundtrack and graffiti art on the walls. I'm not sure I would queue again for that long while hungry, perhaps if I had a snack I would. A good effort, a great burger but I still think Meat Liquor could be better.",

The deco is very peculiar, quite gothic and dark... I enjoyed it !The beers were quite small for their price (however, matched completely with the relatively low price of the food thereafter...). The food, then, was as I suspected: more fatty than tasty (I wonder who gets some onion rings on the menu, after you've eaten a couple of those calorie bombs while queing outside...), the burgers were well cooked though, and my Philly cheese steak was OK. The sides were great, and we loved the chicked wings, and the cheesy fries.I'm still wondering though, how we managed to eat it all...",

Find people you don't mind talking to for long periods of time, shouldn't be too hard.American food, kinda nailed it. Decent burgers, good wings, GREAT chili cheese fries. And I am a huge sucker for chili cheese fries. They put mustard on theirs which seemed weird to me at first but it totally works. I would probably go back just for the chili cheese fries.Fun cocktails. I basically had an alcoholic mango smoothie and it was excellent. There are tons of other fun, creative cocktails to choose from.I could do without the super loud, clubby atmosphere. Weird, gothic interior, dark, with black room photography type lights. INSANELY LOUD. It might have been turning into a club in the middle of our dinner, not really sure. You can't talk to people, so it's a good thing you said everything you wanted to say to your friends in the queue.",

It's massive, it's smothered with blue cheese and the chicken is crisp and cooked to perfection. I quite liked the dead hippie burger as well. The chilli cheese fries compliments the burger really well too.I don't quite understand why the place is too dimly lit, it restricts you from admiring your gorgeous plateful. Also I had 'No Brainer' and a cocktail with my burger which I didn't enjoy at all. It was pricey and it didn't taste very nice. I wish they had more familiar beer brands as well.",

    "text": "Meat Liquor is everything you want a burger joint to be provided that you just want to rock out to a burger, boom out some lyrics, and don't the feel an overwhelming urge to have a serious conversation with the people next to you.The first permanent MEATfamily location, it boasts a considerable number of seats that are perpetually full. Event at almost 10pm on a Tuesday night, there was a 15 minute wait for a table and the place was jumping. There is a full bar or you can go for beer in 330ml cans (something I thought you'd couldn't get on this side of the pond). The d\u00e9cor is more satanic heavy metal rock than anything else with some truly disturbing murals on the walls and ceilings.Being the older of the siblings (compared to MeatMarket), ML does have more things on the menu like buffalo wings and deep fried pickles plus a few more burgers to entice you. Kevin L raved about the wings so of course we had to get them. I'll give ML credit - they were good wings. The buffalo sauce was hot and tangy and the blue cheese dip acted as the perfect balance. Oh hot wings, how I've missed you! Pickles aren't my thing but given the speed they disappeared I gather they were pretty tasty too. Other starters included chilli cheese fries and pulled pork covered fries, both of which were awesome although quite filling.For my burger, I opted for the chilli burger in order to give the MEATfamily a second chance after my appetite-killing experience with the Dead Hippie at MeatMarket. This time I was much happier with a juicy tender patty covered in jalapenos and perhaps the odd green chilli. The bun was a win as usual and stayed soft while absorbing a good amount of juices. They also do a Chilli Challenge where you have to try to eat a chiliburger, a chilidog, and a big bowls of chilli cheese fries. I've got to say I'm pretty tempted by this although most likely in November once the races are done for the year. The fastest time is 3.45 which is a bit insane although something of a \"goal\" to aim for.Overall, an enjoyable meal and a pretty solid burger. It's changed my opinion of the MEATfamily food (although not of the Dead Hippie sauce) however I think I'd opt for takeaway rather than the chaos of the interior. Worth going once for the experience, the 2nd time I'd rather eat in peace and have a chat without risking my voice.",
