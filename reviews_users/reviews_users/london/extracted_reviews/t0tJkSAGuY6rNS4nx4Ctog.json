    "text": "Three of us went for the afternoon tea package at the Portrait yesterderday at 3.30. As ever, the view was great and we had the most charming waitress. There were almost more tea leaves in each of the teapots than hot water, whoever was on tea making duty in the kitchen yesterday apparently did his/her tea making apprenticeship on building sites. A waiter kindly agreed to bring us hot water which weakend the effect a tiny bit. In terms of sandwiches each person was allotted 4 small triangular sandwiches so, essentially, two slices of bread each. One triangle contained ham \u00a0OK, another contained egg mayonnaise \u00a0OK, another contained tinned tuna mayonnaise \u00a0not really afternoon tea material and the fourth grated cheese and chutney \u00a0a new take on afternoon tea which.. really doesn't work and was unpleasant. A baking powder tasting scone each with a little pot of jam and a serving of cream, underneath the two servings of cream was some yellow sponge cake which we couldn't quite fathom \u00a0had the cream been scraped off the top of sponge cakes??. The cakes were by far the worst element: \u00a0a piece of chocolate shortbread dripping in sugar with a cheap and nasty taste- a square of passion fruit cheesecake which tasted as if it had been made from a packet powder mix with an over sugary hard biscuit base, a miniature pavlova which in each case (we had three altogether) was so soggy it collapsed on the journey from the cake stand to the plate and then a little pink macaroon looking really odd beside an enormous slab of carrot cake which tasted like something really vile from Asda, we left one untouched it tasted so awful which must be a record for me. Our chaming waitress was very solicitous, asking us if everything was OK, but where do you begin? \u00a0we concluded it was a lost cause \u00a0the cakes were so vile that there was just no scope for improvement. Our advice would be not to ever entertain the idea of the afternon tea package here \u00a0the restaurant has a lovely view and our waitress was a charmer but, although it's quite an extreme thing to say, the afternoon tea really was disgusting. \u00a319.95 is admittedly a cheap option for afternoon tea in London but this one was gross.",

Get away from the otherwise ticky-tackiness of Trafalgar Square and enjoy expansive views of London while you sip and nosh on great afternoon tea and treats.Relatively inexpensive at 25pounds per person - there is more food than one normal person can consume. As expected the scones and clotted cream and jam were DELICIOUS. The beet/onion/goat cheese sandwich was also a highlight. The desserts (macaron, chocolate dessert, eclair, fruit tart) were for the most part good.Additionally, the National Portrait Gallery is really an enjoyable destination - a very pleasant surprise.",

    "text": "Duck SongBefore joining the achingly hip crowd gathered for the Late Shift Extra at the National Portrait Gallery, we couldn't resist having dinner at the Portrait Gallery. This rooftop restaurant has the most breathtaking panaromic views of London, particularly on a sunny day.We tore ourselves away from it, to order our main, the confit of duck, presented on an island of creamy mash, surrounded by a lapping sea of red onion gravy. The duck was cooked perfectly, encased in a thin crispy skin which was golden brown. The mash was smooth and well seasoned, while the red onion gravy was a revelation. My dessert of raspberry and apple crumble, arrived with a tiny side jug of custard, which took the edge of the fruit's combined tartness. My other half unfortunately went for the chocolate pot which was lovely, but far too large a portion for something so rich. Late Shift Extra We finished dinner and headed downstairs to Room 20 - The Reform Room. A beautifully proportioned room, full of paintings of notable British historical parliamentaries and reformists. In front of an epic execution of The House of Commons, 1833, drawfed by the sheer scale of the canvas stood Andreya Triana. This tiny, bare footed powerhouse singer songwriter, treated us to an emotive, soulful tinged delivery of six excellent songs.Accompanied by a keyboard/mixer and talented guitarist 'Matt' , she ended her set with a brilliant electro choral reworking of the Eurythumics\"Sweet Dreams\". Her voice soared over a deep, pounding bassline, that had the whole audience rocking. All in all a great Friday night !",

    "text": "When we first arrived I was concerned it could be a snooty kind of place with uppity staff and tiny portions. I was so please to find I was completely wrong. My wife , daughter and I had arrived for brunch at about 11:20am on a weekday and were greeted by very friendly maitre D who seated us immediately. We had a table at the window with an awe inspiring view of the city. We had booked earlier but were one of only three groups of diners in at that time. It did get busier at about 12:15 so I would suggest booking to prevent disappointment. Our waitress was a stunning 6ft tall Germanic amazon who evidently spent more on manicures and shoes \u00a0than I do on cars and houses. On seeing her I surreptitiously eyed the menu to see if there were any hidden surcharges such as an arm and a leg for service but apart from the usual 12% there were none. My wife was enjoying my awkwardness immensely and suggested I ask her out! The food was beautifully prepared which was expected with a nice portion size which was not. The dishes themselves were fantastic. It was wonderful to see English food being presented in such an appealing way. The dish I relished most was the black pudding which was on wilted spinach and topped with a poached egg and devilled sauce. This was perfect as everything seems better with a poached egg. I balanced out the meal with the smoked chicken Caesar salad which was nice but not as monumental as the black pudding which even the picky 9 year old thought was \"Yummy\". \u00a0 Our daughter had the soup of the day which was pumpkin (she's 9!) and chips which were enormous and perfectly cooked being golden and crisp on the outside with a fluffy center. My wife had the goats cheese and red onion tart with rocket which was also delicious. I still won with the black pudding!The amazon was attentive and professional and made a fuss over our daughter which was duly appreciated. The dining experience was a excellent from start to finish. The price is moderate to high but well worth it considering the location view, quality of food and that Heidi Klum's younger sister works there!The majority of the tables are along the Southern windows so you will have a perfect excuse to wear your cool Ray-Bans during lunch as it does get very sunny. The photo's do not do the place justice.",

With a world class collection of art below thos top floor eatery featuring stunning views of many of London's most noted landmarks and the menu in the capable hands of head chef Katarina Todosijevic, this is a winner of a place to eat.

Firstly, the place commands a fairly elite presence. Although a restaurant, they serve only breakfast and lunch, so most of their patrons tend to be local professionals, not tourists. Business attire (suit) is suggested if you want to fit in, but probably not mandatory; reservations are highly suggested; being escorted by someone who is a regular there doesn't hurt. Be prepared to pay higher prices for food which would be considered fair-good if presented from a street-level cafe. As with any establishment \u00a0with a view, the prices of the food do not reflect the quality, rather they reflect the height at which the kitchen is perched. Not bad food, just not Earth shaking. Fall/Winter in late afternoon provides the most dramatic view in my opinion.",

    "text": "Come for the view, but definitely stay for the food.Located discreetly on top of the national portrait gallery (also totally worth a visit) at the ever so busy Trafalgar Square , the Portrait restaurant offers a fabulous view of many famous landmarks in Westminster, a delicious seasonal menu, and a lively but surprisingly peaceful atmosphere that's so rare in this area.I ordered the bouillabaisse, which is a lighter and more lunch appropriate version of the famous Marseille dish. The fish was cooked to perfection. I also tried lamb from the tasting menu, it was tender, flavourful and an absolute delight to eat. On to dessert, the chocolate saint-\u00e9milion was rich but not overly sweet, the spiced roasted pineapple with lemon sorbet was refreshing, yet interesting with a slight kick of chili. The festive cocktail, lemon drop Bellini, was beautiful, easy to drink and not as sweet as it sounds. For someone who has trouble finishing any alcoholic drinks, I drank up the last drop. The service was also impeccable from beginning to end. To me, the Portrait restaurant was a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect to have a such an exquisite meal in a gallery but I enjoyed every aspect of it. I'd highly recommend anyone to pay a visit.",

Sitting on the top floor of the National Portrait gallery, this place is a complete gem. The service and staff was phenomenal. The table setting was elegant and the menu really topped off the entire experience. Going to the restaurant was a real treat especially since the museum is already free (and SO worth it!) I would definitely make it a point to visit and eat here while in London!",

They brought the steak 2nd time which was cooke exactly the same as the 1st steak. The manager came to talk to me, and the waiter offered me the 3rd plate. I told them it is fine since I have to go (first steak arrive late). They did not charge me for the steak and offer me any dish I want on them. Even thought it was weekday lunch time, the restaurant was full. Mistake can happen especially during rush hour. I gave them five star because they had the right attitude about the mistake. And mushroom soup was incredible. Do make reservation since it gets full even weekdays.",

Spectacular view of Westminster, my first sighting of the London Eye was from inside of Portrait and it really got me excited about the week we'd be spending in town. This was one of our first meals in London as we were staying right off of Trafalgar Square. The food and the service were wonderful (why is the butter so delicious???) Just a lovely little gem. After our meal, we wandered around the museum. Free admission! What a luxury. Take note, US!",

We were there for Sunday brunch and enjoyed the special roast beef with yorkshire pudding of course. My daughter had the chicken with polenta, looked plain and boy was it tasty. The chicken liver appetizer is a home run, my 11 year old daughter had never tried it and ate half my order. The panna cotta dessert was delightful. Also, the flower salad is beauutiful and delicious. We enjoyed the experience so much we return again for lunch the same week.

You can see everything from the London eye to Westminster abbey. We came here for afternoon tea. Afternoon tea is only from 3:30 to 4:30 Thursday to Saturday I think and the tea set is around \u00a330 per person. Each person gets 3 savory items, two scones, and 3 desserts. Personally, I think the scones are the best and the desserts were not impressive at all. You also get unlimited tea. You're basically paying for the view. Small tip for people who don't want to spend a lot of money - just order one/two set and share the food. The others can just get the tea. It's cheaper that way ;)",

We got seated right by the window, so we had an amazing view of Big Ben, Trafalgar Sq, etc. It was really beautiful! It's also nice that it's not directly visible from the museum and somewhat hidden on a different floor. Unfortunately, it's distracting to take it all in when the restaurant is so loud. I feel like I could hear everyone's conversations but my own. The food was also a solid 3.5 out of 4 stars. I had the gazpacho which was really great, but the ice shot in the middle filled with oil that kept spilling made it less good. I also had the baked saffron rice stuffed tomatoes - it was again much too oily! The rice was a little dry within the tomatoes but the Romesco sauce was too oily for me. The person I was with had the smoked salmon/waldorf salad to start which was good, and then the mackerel which he said was nothing special/not great.Given all of this, I will give the final 4 stars because the service was phenomenal. They were so attentive throughout the whole night and gave a birthday surprise to the person I was with!",

Yes, please!Portrait Restaurant on the top of the National Portrait Gallery boasts really fantastic views of downtown London, Big Ben, the London Eye and Trafalgar Square, along with more brass cupolas than I realized London had, until you find yourself at this fantastic vantage point and see that its really a town full of ancient towers and cupolas. (Must look up more often!) The food at Portraits is actually quite good, but pricey. \u00a0Entrees ala carte are basically the same price as a fixed meal with either starer and main or main and dessert, so you may as well splurge and get something more substantial at lunch.Not all all kid friendly, this is a fancy, traditional spot full of white suited waiters and multi course meals, which I hadn't realized when I booked. \u00a0Still, coming here with an older child of nine, there wasn't anything on the menu kid-appropriate. It would be nice if they might realize that not all patrons are going to want a three course lunch, or some overly gourmet main. Clearly, they could care less about a stubborn American mom who is desirous of a rooftop view of London that she drags her well-behaved child to subsist on a croissant and orange juice at lunchtime --ahem! Bad mummy.For me, nicely cooked fish, fennel, grapefruit and spinach entree, and a very creamy cauliflower soup along with a bread basket for 25 pounds (gasp) was a nice, satisfying and expensive experience.Keep in mind this is a very generous lunch, and you may be sleepy while wandering about the gallery. \u00a0Next time, will come for breakfast --a better value certainly, and the view is something worth repeating.",
