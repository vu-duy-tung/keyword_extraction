It's cheap, and in a really convenient location just off Brick Lane, opposite Beyond Retro, the mecca of vintage shops in the East. So after a hard days shopping, you can come in here and put your feet up with a lovely ale. Come night, the drinkers here are really friendly, I've spent many a long evening being a tit in the beer garden, managing to even make a few friends! A great staring place for a night out, with the option of heading to either Brick Lane or Bethnal Green as both are within five minutes walk. Pop in for a pint and i bet you end up staying!",

However, it has still managed to retain some of the old boozer character that can be lost under such circumstances. A few reassuringly anonymous German beers are available on tap, as well as a cracking suffolk cider. The mirrored bar also has a really good range of bottled Belgian beers, including Chimay and Fruli. There's a hideaway decked beer garden, but it doesn't get the best of the sunshine. There's some cosy sppots to be found inside, and it's dog friendly too.",

Most pubs have a long wine list, divided into country ad region. Lovely. Great. The Carpenter's on the other hand has the chalk board of beers. 'Mmmmm' I hear you sigh. Yes, very mmmm. But I think it gets even better. The Carpenter's is modest in size but out back they have a perfectly formed little beer garden in which for you to while away the hours.

Excellent selection of beers; when I was there they had an Adnams seasonal ale, Tim Taylor and Ubu, plus a very good hefe weisse I'd never heard of, a couple of random Belgians on tap plus a few more in the fridge, and lots more. I didn't have any food but they have proper pork scratchings so clearly ordering something off the menu is unnecessary.

Things I usually say to people trying to find it...\"take Cheshire Street and keep going, until you think you've taken the wrong street, then keep going a little further and it will be there, like a beacon on the corner.\"It is hidden that little bit of the beaten Brick Lane track, but well worth the search!",

This means that people get tipsy but it's not a rowdy bar. Nick C is right, it's far enough for it to avoid the hipster twats that pollute the area.It has a proper selection of beer and wine, and some decent house spirits, but if you ask for a cocktail you'll be out on your ear.

My only qualm is the one table next to the toilet which occupies the hallway between the two rooms as if you end up here you miss out on any atmosphere.

It was bought by the Kray twins for their beloved mum Violet in 1967, ah bless them. Legend has it that Ronnie ducked in here for a swift pint before bludgeoning Jack the Hat to death. Quick Wikipedia here: Jack McVitie, more commonly known as Jack The (Trilby) Hat, was a notorious London criminal of the 1950s and 60s. He is posthumously famous for triggering the imprisonment and downfall of the Kray twins. He had acted as an enforcer and hitman with links to the firm, and was murdered by Reggie Kray in 1967. The bartenders will be happy to share this history with you, as you muse nostalgically amidst the dark mahogany furnishings, historic windows and deceptively cosy interior.

But there is even something more about this place which makes it special, is it the atmosphere? or the way as darkness falls you feel truly snuggled in a comfortable nook? Last Christmas it started snowing while I was ensconced inside and seeing the flakes fall through the big windows which were decorated with christmas tree branches and red lights was a highlight of that particular festive season. Living nearby I can better pick and choose when to go. I avoid Sundays as it can get stupidly packed (and perhaps the kitchen is under a lot of pressure judging by some of the comments here) and on Fridays and Saturdays, if you don't have a table by 7pm, you never will. Overall, what we have here is a great pub. One which has been moved on from its east end origins and upgraded subtly to give us one of the best modern-traditionalist bars in the capital.",

They offer great platters of meats and cheeses, but if you go on a Sunday you are in for a treat if you want a roast. Not only do they make a roast, but its a good one. They also offer a nice choice of everything on the menu so if you happen to have one of those vegetarians or even a pescatarian with you, everyone will be happy with the menu. Prices don't kill you either and they give you a good plate of food for your pound. The Carpenter's Arms has all the feel you want from an Eastend pub. This pub has something special about it. One pint and that's it, it will become your new favorite pub and nowhere will match up. The only bugbear is that it gets full very quickly.

    "text": "Cute little pub.My husband and I were visiting from the States and just finished up at the Renegade Craft Fair down the street. It had started snowing pretty heavily, so I pulled up my Yelp App and saw that this place was 1) close 2) had good reviews, so we stopped by.I ordered a glass of Prosecco & the Scotch egg, and my husband had a beer & the soup of the day (blue cheese & broccoli).My Scotch egg was brilliant! I had never had one before, and I don't really eat much pork...but YUM. The spicy mustard was an excellent addition as well. (The brown sauce isn't really my favorite, but it wasn't bad.) The side salad that came with the egg was also excellent.Lose one star because my husband's soup was pretty bland. I gave him about half of my egg so he didn't starve. :pThe best part, though, was that we had carol singers stop by and serenade us! The snow was beautiful outside; it felt so Christmasy.What a wonderful British experience!",

So you got nice local draft beers and a whole bunch of imported beer from Belgium and even some weird ones form France. \u00a0I have heared that they even server snails but been the person i am am for the time been i would avoid that heheheheheWhat i think is a really winner for the place is the place itself. Its small and very very very very traditional. Also the variety of people is simply \u00a0.... WOW. Locals from Brick lane and around mixed with the occasional tourist who just took the wrong turn and .... voila :DIf you wanna something a bit out of the tourist way and if you are fed up with people trying to push you in their restaurant as well as try a local place you should definitely pay a visit.",

The bartender was so nice and offered me to taste many ales before I made my decision. Second, for the atmosphere. So many pubs have become so gentrified and taste like gastropubs, which I can find any day in LA. At Carpenters' Arms, even though there is not Fish and Chips, people don't try to be trendy and welcome crowd that is more than milleniums. That area of London needs more places like this.",

Great neighborhood place, with delicious food. We were overwhelmed with ale choices, the server asked a couple questions, and served us Purity Brewing Co.'s Pure UBU Amber Ale, which was smooth, and entirely drinkable.",

The menu is on a chalkboard on the wall which kind of suggests simple menu = great food and boy does it deliver. Had some delicious food here and always washed down with a gluten-free beer. Now I know gluten-free is considered by some a 'hipster' trend but as a genuine sufferer of coeliac disease, it's always nice to know where you can get a good beer from! This pub has a small sun trap at the back which is quiet and the perfect antidote to the often bustling Brick Lane.It's also opposite the vintage store Beyond Retro so perfect if you want a few minutes of unhindered retail therapy whilst your other half peruses the beer options!",

I had a wonderful German wheat beer when I was here that wasn't one of the normal ones you see around, but unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. They also have their own Carpenter's lager that was also a good choice.Inside you'll be impressed with how cozy it feels. The front room where the bar is located isn't terribly large, but there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit at. There's also a fairly large room in the back with more seats, and a nice outdoor area in the back. Looking forward to coming back here.",

Well chosen beer selection (not too many, I don't need hundreds of choices). The staff are friendly and you get the feeling they take pride in their pub.The pub itself is just what I want in a pub. Not too big, not to small and with cosy tables to sit at in a dark wood interior. There are several rooms extending to the back and and even a tiny beer garden hidden away behind that. It's a pleasant contrast to those wannabe 'gastro' places with huge huge dining room tables with deafening volume that require to you shout across to be heard. None of that here. It's all on a more human scale.It's another example of my personal rule that says that the best pubs in London are just far enough off the beaten track...not outside a tube station or directly on a crowded thoroughfare but slightly hidden away. In this case it's about a 5 minute walk down a quiet street from the seething crowds in the Brick Lane area. This is where they always are...That also means that the punters are pleasant and not full of irritating types and you don't need to push through crowds to get served.Haven't tried the food but it fits with the rest of the pub, the menu at least is proper pub food, refreshingly absent of silly named dishes desperately trying to be on trend.Just perfect.",
