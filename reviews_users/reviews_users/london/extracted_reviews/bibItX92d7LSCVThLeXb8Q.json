    "text": "Any place with a crowd as persistent and devoted as that at Tapas Brindisa must be doing something right.Full disclosure: I didn't order any of the mounds of incredible food I saw pass by me when I sidled up to the bar on a recent Saturday. I had quietly broken off from my vegetarian/vegan family for half an hour to come in and try the ham -- legendary ham, according to a London friend.I ordered a platter of charcuterie that could have kept four people busy, and a healthy glass of tempranillo. All the hams on the Gran Reserva list came from animals raised near the Portugal border, and fed a steady diet of acorns and chestnuts. (If the restaurant had mentioned \u00a0that the animals were serenaded with the Pan Flute every evening at sunset, I wouldn't have been surprised.)The jamon itself was stunning: buttery, salty, velvety, and profound, with an intriguing funk from years of aging in the Iberian heat. The chorizo was equally addictive -- with a chili heat, but only enough to warm the mouth. The tempranillo was a perfect match.While I snacked, I saw awesome-looking platters go by: steaks with eggs, patatas bravas, shrimp bathing in garlic butter. I'd advise any visitor to try all of them based on the sight and smell alone.",

The attached photo is for lamp chops. Admittedly delicious, but at nearly 10 pounds for two teeny tiny fatty chops, I'm not sure how the staff sleep a t night. Perhaps the reason they all sneak off to the kitchen is for a quick guffaw. Be prepared for it to be noisy, cramped and uncomfortable. We spent a comparative fortune, but we're off now to go and have some food as we're hungry. Tapas I get, but if you're charging main courses per plate, it just feels like it's starting to hurt when you sit down, if you see what i mean. Grrrr.",

    "text": "Came to Brindisa on Saturday morning for breakfast by chance upon wanting to kill time at 10am and we were looking for a good and not super pricey place to dine.We walked by, took a glimpse at the menu and decided to see what else was open at Borough. The only other real sit down place was roast and at \u00a312 for an eggs benedict we we obviously not sold. So back to Brindisa we trotted. I opted for the scrambled eggs, mushrooms and grilled tomatoes with manchego cheese at a modest \u00a36 and the other half settled on their iberico ham with two sunny side up eggs and chips. Now we thought to also throw in an order of bread with lavender honey, but our waiter politely informed us of the portion sizes so we held back.And true to his word the portions were big...dare I say huge? I think it was because it was 10am and I'm not used to having mother feasts such as the one that was laid on the table before me. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and what I sensed was a lovely garlic butter flavour. The eggs came on fresh sliced toasted bread and the slices of manchego was a tasty combination.I must venture back for the actual tapas menu as I've heard good things. But when in need of a hearty breakfast, Brindisa does not disappoint. I quite literally did not eat again until dinner time...",

It is not too far from where i work and i came for lunch here with Gemma on one of her short notice visits to London.We wanted to sample as many of the dishes on offer as possible. We ordered four items to share. 1. Spanish omelette, one of my long time favourites. It had been cooked with generous amounts of onions and potatoes, and so was extremely tasty. 2. Hake. It was alright. I personally don't find much flavour in fishes that are merely boiled. This was surely not my favourite item on the menu. 3. Chorizo. Here they did really well. It was served with red peppers and toast. The best dish that we had, in my opinion. 4. Lamb cutlet. It contained quite a lot of meat. But we weren't given a choice on how it was to be cooked. It turned out to be a little more \"bloody\" than the cutlets that I am used to. With one drink, the price tag came to be about \u00a320 per person. Given that I generally liked the food and that the price was reasonable, I want to go back. But they don't accept reservations. I did try to get a table one evening, but was scared off by the potential 2.5 hour wait. I hope I have better luck next time.",

    "text": "First, this is one of my favorite areas in and around London. On a sunny day this is the place to go. I had lunch at Tapas Brindisa today. \u00a0The area is crowded, but not too bad. You'll find a combination of locals and tourists. Overall, not too annoying. I recommend a table outside if possible, the interior is cramp. My favorite dishes:1. Pan de coca - (why) I love bread and olive oil. The flat bread and tomato is balance and there is a little salt to tingle. (comment) The bread is amazing if you dip it into the gambas al ajillo. Definite order again.2. Gambas Al Ajillo - (why) I love the idea of olive oil, garlic, and prawns. (comments) prawns are a good size and dish isn't too bad. I think they can add more garlic and oil to the dish, but overall not too bad. Order again but would like to be spicier and more oil.3. Croquetas de jamon -(why) classic Spanish & idea of ham inside mash potatoes! (comments) the dish is tasty and not too oily and burnt. The croquetas are a good size and well fried. I would order these again.4. Tortilla de chorizo (why) eggs, potatoes, and ham is a good combination to eat. (comments) the dish was a little disappointing. The tortillas are all pre-made, so not as fresh as I like. You are serve a wedge from a larger piece. I would have preferred and fresh tortilla where the egg oozes after you cut into it.Overall opinion: I would definitely return and probably wouldn't want to wait too long for a table. This is not the best tapas in London, but I think the location and food are a good combination.",

    "text": "So how's the original outpost of growing tapas juggernaut of Brindisa doing since I last visited? Not as well as I'd hoped unfortunately... Situated on the corner of Borough Market's southern corner, no bookings Brindesa was always a tough (and tiny) table to score, light wood interior filled with souls exiting the market laden with goodies, unable to wait until their home before sampling them. The unlucky masses would look on through the floor to ceiling windows and resolve to turn up earlier next week. A recent midweek trip to the neighbourhood let me pop in for lunch on one of the less screwily busy days for the restaurant before the market next door grunts into life on a Friday.The menu is still a organic shopper's wet dream, everything veggie sourced from the nearby stalls while meats and spices come from the Brindesa shop, hotfoot from the best suppliers in their Spanish homeland. The joy has always been that you don't want to wait until you get home from the market, mainly because what the kitchen can do with the same handful of ingredients is infinitely better than anything you could manage.We've been spoilt by Jose, and the jamon croquetas he now serves up on Bermonsey Street. Those are light, fresh and heaven sent, these lumpen cigars of gluey mash under a too thick oily carapace just don't cut the mustard. Huevos Rotos - broken eggs over fried potatoes and Iberico pork sobrasada - is unevenly cooked. Soft slices of spud seemingly decanted into a lukewarm serving dish, the egg just the wrong side of soft and the sobrasada, a thickly spiced tomato based sauce, huddled in one corner under a slice of waxen potato. A great idea, and one I'm looking forward to borrowing for an inevitably hungover brunch, but there's nothing here any reasonably home chef couldn't improve on. Saut\u00e9ed chicken livers with an onion and caper dressing were fine, and well cooked. If I'd just taken a plate of that with a muscular minerally and obscenely dry sherry, I'd no doubt be hurrahing from the rooftops. Compared to a recent revisit to gracefully ageing Barrafina, the team at Tapas Brindisa have got some way to go to regain their crown. If you're in the area, nip round to Bermondsey Street and see what their old boss Jose Pizzaro is up to at his brace of eponymous restaurants, either one of them easily has the measure of Brindisa I'm sad to say...",

We had no reservation anywhere (Hey, I live in a town that doesn't need reservations!), a few places ventured/asked/begged had, on average, slightly more than an hour wait. But then, there's Tapas Brindisa, says I. I checked the Yelp app, it's gotten great reviews! Don't fail me, Yelp!We got super lucky. They informed me on the phone it was an hour wait, but if we came over fast, like a few minutes quick, there was a group about to leave and we could fill the spot. No, they don't take reservations you get here or you're screwed. Yes, it was pissing down rain that night, too. RUN BITCHES, RUUUUUUUN!!We made it! Success! And it was totally worth it. The place is intimate. We were a group of five and our seating arrangement was tight, but not uncomfortable. We sat next to other people but I never really heard their conversation all evening. If you start to feel claustrophobic just remember: vodka makes you love EVERYONE. Between the five of us we ordered about 12 dishes, maybe 14. Everyone ordered two (and we shared) and only a few people opted for dessert. We didn't have one bad tapas plate. They were all delicious. I especially enjoyed the creative pieces, like fried goats cheese with honey, and chorizo potatoes. We vacated when they were closing up. Also, do keep in mind that in London they will charge a 12.5% gratituity. You can ask them to remove it, but that's entirely up to you. You do get the death stare if you ask for them to remove it. I HAVE NO SHAME. (don't worry I added a small tip, GAWD).",

We went here because were looking forward to enjoy fantastic food around or in the Borough Market. Gladly our expectation was met and hunger satiated by Tapas Brindisa. This place offers breakfast menu which is much smaller than their regular menu but I must say it is deliciously well proportioned. I devoured those tasteful chorizo paired with eggs and potatoes while the mister had manchego cheeze, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes and eggs. We gulped down fresh orange juice along with our breaky! Yummy! I am happy happy happy for less than \u00a320! Cheap date? Nah, just a sucker for a tasty food.",

It'll always be busy here, not only because of its location in Borough Market, but because it carries a reputation for excellent food and a huge wine selection. And the reputation is deserved.We waited at the bar on a Sunday evening for 15 mins or so before being shown the table. The food menu is long, but neatly divided into types of food and even regions. I wouldn't normally think to order a fillet steak for a tapas meal, but it was fantastic; served on bread with onion chutney.Other highlights were the spinach, the chorizo and the croquettes. I'd love to come back here again, if only to try some more of the wine list!",

    "text": "I'm lucky enough to be able to get to Brindisa in about 15 minutes from my bolt hole in South London and its always a pleasure when someone suggests it for lunch or dinner (not a great place for solitary dinning in my opinion as it's a little too hectic). The no booking policy works well but means that given its position on the corner of the market and the fact that its very well known you need to get there early on a Saturday or linger about outside because the bar area is always full. In fact I'm beginning to think I might actually prefer eating in the bar area this summer - there are a couple of settings in the window which are quite quiet if you fancy something more intimate and the high stools by the door are nice and cool and give you a good view of all the action. Wherever you manage to get seated it's going to be cosy. Anyway yesterday was a light lunch to get us in the mood for a wander along the Thames and some retail therapy. B ordered up the clams with bacon and capers, the secreto iberico pork, tomato bread and a couple of glasses of the house white. Everything was excellent but the pork was just sublime - really well seasoned, full of flavour and cooked with a very skilful touch. The menu here is really well thought out and there is hardly a dish I would not think about ordering. I think the key is to order food to suit the mood and take it from there - I often see people over ordering so I'd advise taking it easy and order a couple of courses at a time as you won't be rushed to vacate your space. The punters are what you might expect in Borough Market. Plenty of foodie locals and tourists with an interesting smattering of randoms. The breakfast menu at the weekend looks great but you need to get there before 11am - I live in hope!!",

    "text": "It is a love affair. The wait and time apart may be painful, heart wrenchingly so, but the reunion is always playful, passionate and steeped in goats cheese and honey.I started eating at Brindisa many years ago and it was my first real London regular. Nestled on the edge of the bustling Borough markets it was the place that I would always end up, my culinary home. It is very New York esque in its business model, they don't take reservations, if you get there after 7pm on a week night expect a 2 hour wait. I use to bide my time with several pints of Franziskaner outside the pub on the opposite street corner, did I ever tell you I love street side drinking?The menu is revolving, unpretentious and simplistic, mirroring the decor, food and staff, however there a few mainstays including the aforementioned goats cheese and honey. It is blissful, lingering and seductive, Monte Enebro goats cheese, flash fried, drizzled in honey and topped with crispy heart shaped beetroot chips, scrummalicious. My other regulars include the Chorizo Tortilla, rich and heady and the country toast with Alioli, slightly charred delicious brown bread with an Alioli so rich in its oliveness. The prawns in garlic are a must, don't let them take the dish when finished as the garlicky prawny oil is delish, smear it on your face and bossom and revel. The padron peppers are simplicity at its finest, lightly fried in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. \u00a0If you are feeling flush order some Joselito, I cannot roll my R's, but f**k I love this ham born from sweet nutty little acorn fed pigs its the finest on this planet.In summary, go there, drop your guard and if you don't like it well F off.",

Despite the place being busy we only waited 20 minutes for the food and it was lovely.Brindisa also has a stall on Borough Market at the back of the restaurant which offers a good range of authentic Spanish ingredients such as tuna loin - yes, it is rather expensive but the food is worth it.",

But you can grab a drink at the bar whilst you wait for your table (45 min for us, bit longer than we'd have liked, hence the loss of a star).Anyway, the staff were a friendly bunch (even enduring my friend's attempt at speaking Spanish to them - cringey). We each ordered three dishes from the menu, there was plenty to choose from, but we stuck to the less than \u00a38 dishes (some were upwards of \u00a320 each).It started arriving in waves - my favourite format for being fed - and each and every one of those dishes was utterly delicious, a mouth-watering welcoming assault on the tastebuds.The two bottles of Rioja Zarabanda were also enjoyed (they were about \u00a320 each).So all in all, a relatively expensive meal for a northerner, but it was totally worth the money, it just needs to be a bigger restaurant to seat more people quicker!",

And it looks a bit basic at first glance. The service was quick, very friendly and the food was delicious! The tapas are good in size, you might want to order two or three for each person. I recommend this place.",

    "text": "I had dinner here on a weekday evening with a friend, as we were looking for a bite close to London Bridge station and this is known to be one of London's best Spanish restaurants. We arrive at 7:15 PM and were quoted a 1h to 1h30 wait, for which we could either wait in the restaurant or leave and come about after an hour. The bar was crowded at the time and there was no room to stand against the counter, so we decided to go around the corner to Vinopolis for a drink before returning. We came back around 8 PM and were seated at 8:10 PM, so just less than one hour! We ordered the pan con tomate, Brindisa cheese selection, iberico de cebo ham, artichokes with truffle oil, croquetas de jamon, and fillet steak. The server asked how we would like the plates to come, and we asked for the first three together, which were more like appetizers, and the second three as main courses. The pan con tomate was surprisingly nice, not just your typical tomato spread but actual chunks of tomato on top. The iberico ham was extremely generous, with at least 10 slices on the plate, layered over each other and there was plenty to go around. We had four types of cheese on the platter, with 3 slices each for the hard cheeses and some soft cheese options as well. They were ok but nothing spectacular. The croquetas were my favourite main, and we got four of them, all of very large size. The artichokes must have been artichoke hearts and had a consistency of a root vegetable, but with the truffle flavour, it was of course still delicious. And the fillet steak actually comes served on bread, with cheese melted on top, and I kinda thought the cheese/bread mix tasted like what you find on French onion soup. Overall, this was a lot of food for two people, possibly too much, but it was a spectacular meal.",

We put our name down and came back 45 minutes later.True to form, we got a table just over an hour later, which was a huge relief after standing in the crowded bar! The service was attentive and the restaurant was small and loud, but the menu looked great! \u00a0We ordered LOADS and didn't regret it! Highly recommended are the pan de pincel, garlic and chili prawns, patatas alioli and the padron peppers (unfortunately I think these may normally be overlooked, but they are really tasty, little green peppers drenched in Maldon salt). We also had the chorizo board, which was yummy, but at \u00a320 felt a little overpriced.I had a bloody Mary, which was quite full on, so I couldn't finish it, my only addition would be if they did virgin versions of the cocktails for those of us who are less inclined.

Anyway we were sat by the window but not at a table it was kind of sit at the window seal job and they just put your plates of food on that, \"the window seal that is\" Could not get your legs under anything but there was no big issue with it. The food came out very quick and I have to to say it was extremely tasty. Now some might see this as picky but I am a picky person and notice the little things, after all it's the little things that go a long way right. My partner started to order her food and ask the waitress in English if she spoke Spanish. \"Si\" said the waitress so anyway my GF starts to order hers and my food, not a word said to me by the waitress. I did feel a little Left out lol, we Had our yummy food then asked for the bill the lady comes over walks between us and was having a full on conversation with my partner for what felt like about 10 mins about life in Spain and so on but the problem was her back was to me the whole time truly her arse was in my face as she was standing in the middle of us. Now I don't know about anyone else on here but I would take the time out to try involve both people in the conversation if I was speaking to one person in a party of 2 and if I could not I would never have my back to them, rude I say. Would have been 4 stars if not for that complete blankage and almost 10 minutes of back staring I had to do while the lady who could speak English spoke to my GF. LOL.",

Just go when no one goes (which might be never, during the holidays, because the Borough/Bankside area has evolved into a wild evening hotspot for drinkers and foodies alike). You would've still struck a good deal in terms of what you get for the money you pay. I always start with the Huevos Rotos (I've been advised that's what the Iberian natives do). The prawns are always fresh and adequate, a tad bit garlicky (I never understood why par subtle seafood like prawn must be smothered in garlic) but nevertheless a good eat.The croquetas jamon are so much fun, but then I've had very few bad experiences with these. Brindisa gives them an added touch of perfection.The squid ink risotto at Brindisa is still one of my favourites in London. The ink feels fresh and almost aromatised right for adequate flavour infusion into the senses. Neither too squidy nor too inky (if you know what I mean).Overall, while Brindisa might be snubbed when the connoisseurs benchmark it to the likes of Barrafina and Moro, it's still one of the better value for money tapas bars and definitely offers one of the best experiences in London. So two thumbs up for this one!",

    "text": "Went on Saturday night to try their 10th anniversary menu at 2004 prices. It looks like organised chaos, they don't take reservations so you need to go and leave your name on the list, which is controlled by one person who isn't easy to find as she does a multitude of different things at the restaurant. Once you have found her though, she takes your name and you're free to leave and come back. We were told a possible 45 minute wait, but on coming back half an hour later, they were preparing some tables. While we were waiting, a couple sat down at an uncleared table and were quickly turfed out by a waitress. The male turfee was quite loud and rude to the staff but was handled with professionalism and eventually left.We got a range of dishes both from the standard and anniversary menu and they came as follows:Tortilla with Chorizo - easily the best dish of the night, really tastyBroken eggs - little overcooked, the eggs having baked solid - they'd been described as still runny over fried potatos.Padron peppers - salty and oily but with great flavourGrilled lamb chops - nicely marinated and grilled well, but a little expensive for what was on the plate.Finally the spinach. Now this was a problem. Firstly we had to ask twice about the dish, and it turned up when we'd pretty much finished our meal, it doesn't take a lot of time to cook, especially when described as lightly wilted... Secondly, it didn't taste of anything, just a bit of oil and the raisins that it was mixed with. Finally and worst of all, it hadn't been washed and was full of grit. To be honest I had a mouthful and had to rinse my mouth out. We left it behind.4 out of 5 dishes were good, but that last one let them down completely. The waitress didn't say much when we complained about it, just that there was probably just a little left by accident.Not sure I'll be back, or at least, I'll be more careful with my selections.",

    "text": "In London for the day, I couldn't resist the temptation to try out Tapas Brindisa in Borough. A late call to arms to London Yelpers got me a great dining partner in the lovely Tirthankar D (Tapas is always better shared, right?) and we met up for a quick lunch on Thursday.It is not possible to make a reservation here so I made sure I arrived on the dot of 12 and it was easy to secure a table. The restaurant did fill up fast though so I would definitely recommend getting here early. A glass of Tempranillo, served in a tumbler not a wine glass, was a nice starter while I browsed the menu that is split in to many sections - picoteo (small bar snacks), tapas plates, charcuteria, cheese, bread and house specialties. We decided to choose four dishes to split between the two of us - Spanish tortilla, smoked chorizo on toast, grilled lamb cutlets and pan fried hake.The Spanish tortilla was traditional in style, being large in size and full of potato and onions. It was a great accompaniment to the rest of the dishes. The smoked chorizo was served on toast with roasted red peppers and rocket - a delicious dish, but then I am a huge fan of chorizo. The lamb cutlets were very full of flavour and cooked perfectly for me, but maybe a little pink for some people. They were served with a homemade portion of aioli (garlic mayonnaise). My only complaint would be that they were a little on the fatty side. The hake was served with potatoes, onions, fried garlic and paprika. The fish was white and fresh but I feel that if you are going to serve fish with the skin on, it should always be crispy, not flaccid and a little slimy!!The service was definitely more focused on efficiency than friendliness, a far cry from tapas bars in Spain, and even my local haunts in Brighton. I would have preferred a more authentic feel to the service, but I guess this is the price you pay when you come to a restaurant whose main focus appears to be getting customers through the door.I would definitely come back though, there are numerous dishes that I still want to try, and the beauty is that you can stock up on ingredients from their nearby delicatessen in Borough Market and try to recreate the magic at home!",

Me and my partner are not loudest people around so the conversation wasn't easy. On the other hand it did make me think of Mediterranean. Food was good. Small plates of tapas. Do order at least 3 per person as they're not super big. One that blew me away was not a chrorizo thing or some fish but cold and vegetarian mix that I cannot remember the name of and cannot find on the menu. My companion liked it quite a bit. Oh one neutral thing I can say is that bread that we were given in addition was just ok. I'd have hoped for more tbh.I probably won't visit it again due to the loud atmosphere and not very memorable food. Now that I think of the food there again I also don't remember anything spectacular. I guess I do recommend it but not without reservations. I'd feel bad for rating it a 3 but I feel 4 is little high based on my experience. If you like tapas and are all into that atmosphere then you'll definitely enjoy it a lot. Especially go with large group of friends then the experience will be greater with great variance of tapas.",

The croquettes were fresh and flavourful, and the chorizo dish was filling as well. Given this was intended to be a quick pit stop, we didn't order much else, apart from side bread. We enjoyed dipping it away at the garlic oil from the prawn dish. Service was prompt and good. Despite it being busy on a Friday evening, they were quick to seat us (without a reservation) and to bring out all our orders. Ambience was good fun. Nestled close to Borough Market and right outside of the London Bridge tube station, it is one of the most convenient locations for a quick tapas fix.",

Great for a group gathering, but if you are into intimate conversation. Here might not be the place because your \" neighbors\" 2.5 inches away can definitely hear the details hahaa :)They don't take reservation here, so be prepare for a queue during peak hours. I would say an hour is quite common. I highly suggested to get drinks from the back bar before your name gets called up and chill ! If you don't have the time and mood for it, this is probably not the place.Every time we ate here, it has always been a great meal. Our usual orders including the Galician style shrimp, Squid Ink Risotto, Sea bass, tomato salad, and the most traditional tapas such as Patatas Bravas and croquetas de jamon. We also tried the meat dishes, but I would say the seafood dishes are more in my taste preferenceService is hit or miss here, perhaps it's a busy fast paced causal restaurant. \u00a0Overall, we love to come by after going to Borough Farmer's Market. Brindisa is definitely the best choice for tapas in Southwark/ Bankside. I always have a good time here whether I came with family or friends or a date.",

My eggs were cooked to perfection and the chorizo was outrageous. It wasn't too spicy but had a good enough kick to it. I remember eating the chorizo and thinking to myself how this is what a chorizo should taste like.

You have to have more. Especially if it this good. You could shop around the area for something to eat. Lots of fatty pies and stuff galore, but it won't come close to the flavor and quality of this food.I wish I had time for a second meal here.",

    "text": "Full review on thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026 . I've been meaning to eat at Tapas Brindisa for aaaages but their no reservations policy means I've never got a table. But turns out 5pm on a Sunday is a veh good time to go. Having relished Seville's tapas culture, where we realised eating jamon, olives and cheese at the bar far outweighed the delights of proper sit-down restaurant food, we plumped for a lovely bottle of Rioja accompanied with a plate of acorn-fed Ib\u00e9rico charcuterie selection (shoulder, salchich\u00f3n, loin and chorizo) with bread and olive oil; and selection of regional Spanish cheeses with toast. And my god, it was bloody good. Especially the oldest jamon iberica which was just wonderful. I would come back a million times more to eat this giant plate of iberico ham with cheese and bread and rioja, and the most amazingly rich and nutty olive oil, nom nom nom nom nom. Sigh. Anyway, I wanted to try some of the hot food so we ordered the pan-fried squid with green beans and Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar (below) which was spicy but I have to say not as spectacular as the jamon. I'd definitely like to come back for more jamon and cheese and rioja but I'd also like to try more hot dishes like tortilla and the rare fillet steak and king prawns and anchovies and pork fillet and belly. Because we ordered the creme de la creme of jamon, it was more expensive than a typical lunch might be (but worth it!) \u00a0the giant plate of ham and cheese, with extra squid and rioja was \u00a369 including service (or \u00a334.50 each). I will most definitely be back and currently plotting further possible trips to Spain. We were also sandwiched between two veeeery touchy-feely first date couples so I'd add this to my list of romantico date places.",

    "text": "[Non-photo review] For full post see: wp.me/pwXBH-pM  Briskly to Brindisa We were getting hungry and didn't have much time for our early dinner. Unfortunately, Borough market had pretty much wound down by the time we headed out, but fortunately Tapas Brindisa was open, and somehow they had a table for two. Perfect! I had always wanted to eat here given how popular it seems to be amongst foodies, but this was the first time I'd actually tried, so I was excited. After perusing the menu for a while, we decided on a few dishes and they came out very quickly, with the exception of my sardines, which I checked on twice, and after assuring me they had been ordered (twice) finally appeared about 10 minutes after all of the other dishes had been polished off (?!). - Spanish Potato Omelette (\u00a34.50); Grilled Lamb Cutlets with Allioli & Fresh Mint Sauce (\u00a38.75); Onion & Rocket Salad with Pear, Quince & Kokos Vinaigrette (\u00a33.20) - First to arrive were the omelette, lamb chops and salad. The potato omelette was surprisingly good for being such a plain dish. I thought it was seasoned well and it had a very good texture of half egg, half soft potato. Mrs. LF agreed, and enjoyed it mucha. 7/10. The lamb chops were also well seasoned and nice and moist, though they had spent maybe a minute too long on the heat for my liking and were just barely pink in the middle. While there was a fairly spicy allioli to accompany them, I didn't particularly like it and ate them solo for the most part. They were fine, but didn't have that extra flavor hit to make them stand out and be memorable. 6/10. The salad was the disappointment of the bunch. It was really a salad of red onions, with not much rocket and the pears being almost nonexistent. But the thing we both noticed (and still remember) was that it had a very strange taste permeating throughout. At first, we thought it must have come from the quince, but then again quince is a fruit, and that didn't make any sense. I thought it tasted like corn nuts, but slightly sour ones. Maybe it was the 'Kokos', but I don't know what it/they are. In any case, neither of us liked this distinct flavor. 3/10. - Pan Fried Padr\u00f3n Peppers (\u00a35.00) - Despite at first glance all looking alike, there were a couple different types of peppers on the plate, some of which had a wicked little kick (Mrs. LF's nose began to run), and some of which were very mild. They all had a rich, sweet taste and a nice sour acidity to boot. We only ordered them because the huge and rambunctious table next to us had a plate of them and they looked too good to pass up. Plus Mrs. LF fancied eating them with her omelette, which did turn out to be a good combination. We really enjoyed these green little guys. 7/10. - Pan Fried Sardines with Red Onion Salad & Chilli (\u00a36.50) - The sardines finally arrived and they were alright too (they certainly were very nicely presented). The fish was soft and meaty and had a nice flavor to it, and I enjoyed the hints of chilli. The skin was pretty soggy though, and seemed to be intentionally so (don't know if it's supposed to be for fried sardines?), which didn't make it all that pleasurable to eat. All in all, another solid but uninspiring dish. 6/10. I have to say that I did rather like the place overall. I enjoyed the buzzy atmosphere, the quick turnover of tables, and it seemed like everyone there was genuinely having a good time. It is certainly a good place to come with friends and spend a leisurely weekend afternoon. They also have some decent Spanish and Portuguese wines available, both by the glass and bottle. We didn't order that much, but what we did have was generally cooked well, although from the dishes we chose, I didn't really see what all the fuss was about. When in the area again, I would definitely go back to try sample more of the food.",

The steak skewer, salami plate, prawns and salads were all phenomenon dishes! My great uncle makes the most delicious Tortilla Espanola and they actually came to a close second on best we have ever tasted! It was so flavorful and for such a simple dish it seems most restaurants manage to overcook the egg or forget the seasoning!

The produce looks good, they have created a rustic feel to the place, there are legs of serrano and chorizo sausages hanging all over the place and its great - until you look at the price.I am a fan of all things spanish and spent a couple of years living just outside barcelona and things like chorizo and serrano and manchego cheese become part of every day life. Why? firstly because they are delicious. Secondly because they are affordable. In brindisa the ham is sold in 100g measures at a minimum price of around \u00a315.00 per 100g. In Spain the prices are by the kg and ive had some delicious ham for around 15 euros per kg. Now I understand these people have a huge ground rent and you're paying for convienience, and im sure the ham is of a great quality but 10 times more expensive???? \u00a3150.00 per kg??? I would suggest saving some money by finding a cheap flight to spain (i recently got one for \u00a330 return) \u00a0spending \u00a315.00 on a kilo of serrano leaving you \u00a3105.00 to find a hotel and enjoy the magic of espana.This place would have got 2* but i have to admit the hot chorizo, rocket and pepper rolls from the stall outside are les shizzle!!!",

You also need to have all the time in the world and be content to wait standing by the bar for over an hour before getting a seat (but the wine helps with that). Personally, though, I had a great experience. I went with 5 colleagues and even though 6 is a pretty big number for this place, we weren't in a rush so were content to hover around the bar for an hour, drinking wine and ordering Habas Fritas and Padron peppers (amazing! \u00a0Quite salty but I could have eaten them all night!). When we were finally seated, we went to town and ordered quite a lot (calling the waiter over to order more as we were still devouring the first table-full). Yes, it's a little on the pricey side, but from what I tasted, it was totally worth itplus I was lucky enough to have the boss pick up the tab! The highlight of the evening for us was the 'Gambas al ajillo' \u00a0spicy prawns in a garlicky, salty sauce. Amazing! We then used the sauce for dipping bread (and pretty much everything else) in. The Charcuteria selection and Patatas brava o aioli were also amazing. So as long as you're not on a tight budget (or only want a few snacks after gorging yourself on sample cheeses at Borough market) then I can highly recommend Brindisa.",

Try the gambas who are chillied just right, the octopus cooked to be perfection (not the rubber band kind of cooking), or the delicious deepfried honeyed monte enebro goat cheese. Papas bravas a little disappointing and a little too pricey knocks one star off the ratings, just.",

    "text": "Well, now that Brindisa's Exmouth Market location is closed (london.blog.qype.com/?p=\u2026) (weep), I reckon I'll have to join the throngs of savvy shoppers hitting the Borough Market location. No big. I like ambling round Borough Market (don't even mind the crowds really) and Brindisa is a real draw with plenty of yummy treats. I love the grilled chorizo and rocket sarnies too - as long as the queue isn't too winding (good luck with that!).",

Although it was busy, we waited at the bar with a glass of cold fino sherry and some olives until our table was ready. The cured fish dish is exquisite as was the chicken livers cooked in sherry. The only disappointing dish was the jerusalem artichokes. Everything is done in a modern spanish style.",
