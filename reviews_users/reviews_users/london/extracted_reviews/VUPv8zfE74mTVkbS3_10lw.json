Being used to American happy hours at pretty standard pubs, this was definitely a different vibe, but it was fun overall.First, we went downstairs to where we'd booked a table. There were 11 of us, so we got their Thursday night deal, which is this: Book a table of 10 or more people and receive a free round of appetizers, 5 beers, a bottle of champagne, and a round of shots for FREE. There was really no catch, which shocked us all. The shots were pretty much just fruit juice, but everything else was legit.The vibe was very clubby, which is fine, except felt weird for a Thursday at 7pm. You can lose track of time very easily there. My group ended up buying a few bottles and spending the majority of our night there; we had our own little corner booth with a table and seats for everyone, so it was like our own party.The music was typical, top 40-type stuff, although the DJ wasn't too keen on taking requests (refusing to play any hip-hop that may have the N-word in it...I assume he'd have censored versions, no?!). Anyway, I wouldn't go here on my own with friends, just because it was not really my scene, but it was definitely a good time for an after-work happy hour-turned-night-out.",

(I'll let you know when I find it).",

Downstairs is where the party is happening! My friend rented out an area that was comfortable enough for 30 people and away from the crowd. The staff here were very kind in assisting with the cake and were helpful throughout the night. The only drawback is that the place completely closes down at 2am.",

It is also a great place to dance, they have a reasonably sized dance floor and a a great DJ who bangs out Funky House all night.

Well it's NOT.The wannabee WAGS and office workers leering over the gyrating girls confirms that this isn't the trendy bar it would like to be.

(reviewing bar, not restaurant here)They have deals, and the cocktails are tasty, but ohhhhhhhh, the objectification! Yes, I know this happens everywhere, but it it so deep here you have to wade through it. We were tempted in by the drinks offers when we were flyered quite a way up the street, I was on a night out with university friends from newcastle, so yeah, we're used to cheap, boozey nights. As we walked down the street though, misogyny siren started to whirr. These deals that were being handed out (these were a promotion you needed the flyer to fulfil), were only being handed to groups of girls, pretty girls, girls in low-cut dresses, girls with excellent legs (which, you know, it's not the fifties, people are allowed to have), I don't know if this is down to the staff themselves, or on order, the old, fill the bar with pretty girls, and the men will spend the money. Now, when I go out, I expect to pay my way, as do my friends, rounds, who's counting, it's what we do, it comes about even. When I go on dates, I like the person I'm out with to offer, I like to offer, there might be a cheque dance, it's nice, I'm happy to split, I'm happy to take turns in paying, again, it comes about even. Yes, some women like to be paid for, that's their bag, I know some men who prefer to split on first dates to make sure that it isn't just a free meal deal, and setting yourself up for constant billing. (And no, I won't bite your head off if you hold a door for me, I just like to be polite, and make my friends and my partner feel appreciated etc too).This bar goes against all of that, and with intense fervour! In this bar SO LOUD, they seem to encourage needing to practically tongue somebody's ear to be heard, so much so, that a? t one point, my friend and i gave up, and typed on my phone to one another, rather than yell at the top of our lungs within innermost intimate quarters, lips against eardrum. One thing, that is amazingly impressive though, the hearing of the shotgirls. Man, they say dogs have great hearing? We have a new elite! These, of course, absolutely stunning girls, are able to hear a compliment from fifty metres, AND POUNCE, there, in his ear, like the beginning of a human centipede, joined at the lobe, somehow, simultaneously beaming at you, \"Oh, you think her hair is cool do you? Why don't you buy her a drink? You guys want shots? Do you like vodka, sweetie?\" wryly spoken, with a wink. Necks recoiling, eyes wide for the double take. Wasn't she just over there? Are you wearing a wire? Is this chick serious? Tasty cocktails? YesRetaining intact eardrums? NoGood deals? YesHaving drinks bought for you? Likely if femaleAbility to go any further with this person who's bought you a drink if you fancy them? No, the shot girl will be on his shoulder like a parrot, pouring high volume spirits down your neck, so even if you can hear each other, and you're happy to play the man pays all game, and you want to go that far, you'll both be too wasted to do anything but face plant. There are men who walk around without their jaws on the floor due to boobs. There are women who dress how the dress, not to get male jaws on the floor. There are women, that want to still pay their way, with or without jaws on the floor. There are people, who aren't straight, cisgender, man pay, woman bend over. Yes, sex sells, but it seems here, that supporting chauvinism and privilege makes more money.It's 2016, guys!**edit**; also, it is so dark down here, that if you come back out whilst it's still light, you'll need new retinas.",

Cocktails were delicious - nice and fruity however service was very slow considering there was only a few of us in a massive bar. Recommend \"Deep Passion\". The ambiance was some what lacking however it was early on in the evening. If in the area I will be back to take advantage of the cheap cocktails but I wouldn't look to go back for a night out!",

Happy hour was decent but you had to go downstairs if you wanted anything more complicated than a whiskey coke (more a problem for the girls). All in all, if you're in the area and you need a drink, it's one of several in the area, not better or worse than the others, but they have a fair amount of seating and their happy hour goes on for quite a while.",

It was slightly busy but the waitress literally stood there not doing anything when we were waiting to be served. We witnessed a couple walk out after being ignored. I was looking forward to an Espresso Martini only to be told they had run out of coffee. Hmm on a Sunday with an expectant busy weekend with the Christmas Lights being lit around the corner. Poor management and stock control really. Just after our drinks were delivered and we were well and truly settled, the waiter came to ask us if we would move tables as 3 people needed to be seated. Um that for me was the tipping point. The only exception to this is for a disabled person and this was certainly not the case. My burger pattie was chunky and overcooked along with the onion rings. No sauces were delivered to our table and my burger also came out a good 5 minutes after my friends. Probably explaining how it became overcooked! My friends burger was actually apparently delicious so that's some reprieve however her Merlot did not taste like a Merlot. Then the 20% discount deal which is clearly advertised on their menu wasn't working online but we managed to get it approved after filling out a pamphlet. We were hoping to go back but after the lack lustre service, mediocre food and cold air coming through the always open main entry, we're giving it a wide berth.",

I don't know if it was an off day, but the service was terrible. The main issue was that only one server was waiting on all of the tables. There seemed to be other staff around, but they were too busy chatting and doing nothing. The one server wasn't the best either. When we arrived, the server physically pushed my friend out of her way because he had a full tray instead of being polite and saying \"excuse me\". After we were seated she proceeded to forget to bring us our drinks twice. I ordered a burger that took way too long considering they weren't very busy and my sweet potato fries were cold when they arrived. After we ate, it took so long to get any of the staff's attention to get the bill. They were much too busy chatting. I'm pretty sure we could have walked right out of the restaurant without paying and they would have been none the wiser.The icing on this terrible cake was that a service charge was included in the bill. I almost had them take it off, but it wasn't enough money to make such a big deal.Long story short, this place has terrible service and mediocre food. I won't be back.",
