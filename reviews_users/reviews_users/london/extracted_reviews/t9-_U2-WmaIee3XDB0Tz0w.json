Great location, handy for the shopping I had to do in the day on Oxford st, a close walk to some amazing restaurants (we went to Hakkasan) and then perfect for the theatre! Absolutely stunning lobby, and cute old fashioned lifts. Also the champagne bar had all the original decor, super luxurious! The old fashioned elements mixed well well the ultra modern reception and rooms. Rooms are large and comfy, quite striking decor. Bathrooms are gorgeous, great shower! Bed was huge and very comfy. And a great service and tea/coffee in the room. We had room service in the room for breakfast, which was really nice and enjoyable. Quite pricey as you would expect. Also lovely little touch, as it was my birthday they offered us a complimentary glass of champagne in the gorgeous champagne room. Nice touch.Overall definitely would stay here again, such a great location for restaurants and theatres. Saves going home to London bridge, and makes the evening special!",

I'm not sure what else is in the building, but the ground floor also houses a restaurant and some rather swish loos.Cocktails are not inexpensive, but are well made. The whole place has an air of hushed low key grandeur, which I personally enjoy, but it might not be for everyone. Ambience when we visited on a Friday evening at 8.30pm was pretty quiet though.",

The service was very professional and the afternoon tea was great. They have three different types of afternoon tea. Two of them are served by the caf\u00e9, which everything will come together. The other one that I had is called High Society afternoon tea, made from the Oscar Wilde bar. This one is more like a three-course meal. Everything comes separately. For what I had yesterday: a savoury muffin came first then some sandwiches. Desserts and scones were at last. Those two types served by the caf\u00e9 are cheaper than than the High Society one, which is \u00a347.5 included service. The High Society afternoon tea is only served after 2:00 PM. It has a completely different menu, so make sure you order the right one. Will definitely come back again. Everything was lovely!",

It features a number of different bar rooms; The Grill Room is decked out in a very old-fashioned way and is the sort of place you would feel happy taking your grandparents for a birthday tea! The Daniel's Bar located downstairs is slightly more lively \u00a0for the younger folk and they often have special events including live music and entertainment. It is a great place to escape from the bustle of Regent Street even if you can't benefit from a company paid free bar. The music is low enough that you can hear your conversations and you can just about manage to grab one of the comfy sofas. Prices are not as bad as you'd expect - a spirit and mixer worked out at around \u00a33.I completely expected Cafe Royal to be a tourist haunt as it is so predominant on Regent Street and just has that look about it from the outside. I should not judge a book by its cover however but still feel that it is a somewhat odd and 'fragmented' type place.",

The vibe is lush, regency style decor - a little over the top at times but it seems to suit the venue.There are many rooms for hire and the night I was there, the largest room was for the corporate Xmas shows, which included room enough for a comedy stage. Other small rooms where being used for bar areas, hen nights and smaller Xmas parties.It seems like a cool place to have a big old party but I wouldn't go drinking here randomly...",

I've noted that they are renovating and re-theming this so this might help after April 2018. \u00a0The spa and fitness facility are very nice. \u00a0It looks like my go to place in London now, have stayed at the Savoy and Mandarin Oriental - can't beat the location, also over top of Piccadilly Circus Tube station - incredibly convenient.",

While having a touristic tour around Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, China Town its a nice place to have snack, desert and drinks. The place is fronting Regent Street so its a good spot take a break indeed. My favourite sandwich is smoked salmon, horseradish and rocket served in baguette. All prepared fresh. The food is prepared to right amount and space for desserts afterwards. Don't forget to try daily baked cakes.Very elegant and nice cafe. Superb clean toilets. Staff is usually polite. However, on our last attempt they did not allow us with pushchair although they enough space to accommodate us and we offered to fold it. So i think we had enough visits.",

From start to finish there was impeccable service (15% so I would expect so). There was so much food we couldn't eat it all and they offered to top up sandwiches and cakes. They offered palate cleansers in between and champagne was too good. Some afternoon teas can get boring with the food being a bit of the same, they had a really good selection of sandwiches and the cakes were amazing my favourite being apple crumble In a mini flower pot so cute!

The rooms are very spacious and bathrooms a real luxury, with carved marble tubs and showers. The swimming pool is to die for (they even play underwater music!), I just wish it had later hours! :) really pleasant staff and I would highly recommend for couples traveling or business trips. The one not so great experience was that upon checkout, someone had charged a 185\u00a3 facial to our room! We were not happy and it took a while to get to the bottom of this.

    "text": "I went with my girlfriend to celebrate our 5th year anniversary during our first trip to London. Juat by walking into the hotel lobby we knew we would have a great fine dinning experience, but we never expected the service to be so amazingly good. The food: We started with the Wagyu Nigiri, which is by far the best Nigiri we've ever had. For the main, we had the angus filet and the ribeye with sides of gratinated potatoes. The meat was cooked to perfection and the side was very tasty. The service: The food was amazing, but the service was just something you could only expect at the royal palace. We've been to many countries and to many fancy restaurants but we've never seen anything like this. The highlights1) We said \"happy anniversary\" to each other. One of the waiters overhead us and even prepared a lovely dessert for us. 2) Unfortunately, I started to fill dizzy mid dinner (nothing to do with the food or the restaurant). They noticed it and made sure I had water, sugar and fresh air and even walked me to the restroom. They were authenticly concerned which means a lot.3) Everyone was smiling at us, but the 3 most valuable players were the waitress (didn't get his name but he was from Bulgaria, extremely great service) , the bartender (he made a special drink for my girlfriend who doesn't drink alcohol, she LOVED it) and the general manager (Dinos), that made sure we got VIP treatment for our anniversary and also showed authentic empathy for my random health problem.I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting London, more than a dinner, it's an experience. Just go, it's a must.",

    "text": "This is a review for dinner. I noticed almost all other reviews were for the formal Tea service. Not sure why but go for dinner. It's very cool and an elegant setting, not stuffy.Overall 4.5 very strong. A unique approach. At first I thought it was a place that couldn't decide what it wanted to be. A complete sushi bar and offering with real Japanese sushi chefs. The menu also offered many seafood options, non sushi, in what is a real bar and grill. Yup. Sounds strange and isn't.This is London and we sat down about 8:30. Nothing really happens before 8 so if you're a typical American looking for the early bird you'll have the whole place to yourself at 7pm. Funny because in the US 7- 7:30 are coveted res times.Started with lobster sushi rolls. I copied the menu so you'll have an idea of how they're prepared. These are fantastic. Fresh as can be. Comes with 6 pieces. Very rich. A good split dish. Next, the Kale salad which my wife described as Super Food-- and loved it. As most of you know it's next to impossible to get a vegetable in Europe unless it's a side you order. I had the little gem salad. Very simple dish, superb ingredients light and tasty dressing. For mains I had the short rib, my wife had fish. Both were outstanding -- the only miscue of the night was temperature of the fish was Luke Warm. Not worth sending back. I couldn't eat it all it was so rich.As mentioned the cocktails are excellent, a large array of most any spirts you can imagine-- anyone for a little Louis XIII? Great wine list with knowledgeable servers, wine Som.Couldn't even look at the dessert list as we were very satisfied - the did Bring some comp chocolates with the check. We'd go back in NY minute.",

    "text": "This is a review of the high tea. First off, the tearoom is gorgeous and ornate. You feel transported to a fancy room in a palace. A pianist played nearly nonstop with classic music, covers from UK artists and random fun (think: Game of Thrones theme). But I have to admit that I was disappointed with our food at the tea and would not recommend it! We opted for the champagne tea, which started us off with a glass of bubbly for an extra \u00a310. That was really good. They have a large selection of teas and suggest that you switch flavors for the savory and sweet courses. We used a lot of sugar and had to ask a few times for a refill. The menu was surprisingly adjustable. As a vegetarian, I was brought a few alternate choices and they had gluten free bread and desserts for our friend. Much appreciated. Aside from the tarragon egg salad, none of the sandwiches were anything to rave about. One of my vegetarian options were plain grilled bell peppers on bread. I appreciate the effort but it had no flavor. No one was particularly excited about the rest either. Luckily, we had a lovely server! He offered to bring us more egg salad and cucumber sandwiches. I'm glad he did because the desserts were prettier than they were tasty. We each tried a small bite of each tart or pastry but barely ate them. (As we walked in, I noticed a party had left behind much of their dessert. I had assumed they were full but now I think they had the same opinion.) It's one thing to have a dainty tea but it's another to spend $80 on a \"snack\" that didn't live up to expectation. \u00a0We were hungry 1-2 hours later. With all the trays of little sandwiches and treats, we should have at least left sated. I think I'd rather lunch at the cafe next door to pick out one, good dessert and a glass of champagne - or two!",

We tried a few other places that either had very strict dress codes or required reservations, but HCR had availability for a last-minute res on Open Table and welcomed us in despite being in more casual attire.Their exclusive tea blends are diverse, and our group tried the Oscar (toasty!), Triple Mint (refreshing!), and Golden Caryatid (malty, with pearls!), all of which were tasty in their own way. My favorite bite of the food was the chef's amuse bouche, a goat cheese and pickled apple muffin with a bulb of apple juice. The sandwiches were nicely savory, particularly the coronation chicken. Next was a course of scones and clotted cream, which were warm and had a great texture. All of the desserts were almost too beautiful to eat, but so supremely delicious- particularly the apple and Tahitian vanilla caramel tart. As tasty as all the treats were, I still keep coming back to the service being what made it truly excellent- our servers were attentive and we were treated with the utmost professionalism and the live music was an excellent touch. Though the OWB room was beautiful, I wish the lighting were better for photos, which unfortunately didn't really turn out.",

    "text": "We came to enjoy their afternoon tea in the ornate Oscar Wilde lounge. Cafe Royal was awarded \"Best Traditional Afternoon Tea\" in 2017, and it certainly lived up to its award. From the beautifully decorated gilded room with mirrors and painted ceilings; it felt like a room from another era. Additionally, there was a pianist who played nonstop for almost 2 hours. What better way to start the afternoon tea experience. Our server suggested to select 2 types of tea. One to enjoy with the tea sandwiches and a more fruity one to enjoy with the scones and pastries. The tea sandwiches were the traditional ones such as cucumber, egg salad, smoked salmon, chicken salad and ham. Scones were traditional as well with plain and raisin options. All tea sandwiches and scones were delicious and we ordered a second helping of both. The pastries were the only thing on the menu not as traditional and for us, they were not as delicious which was fine because we were so full by this time. I should also mention that children receive a 50% discount off the menu as well as an option to order hot chocolate instead of tea. My son is allergic to cheese, so they made him special tea sandwiches. Service was very accommodating. We enjoyed our authentic British tea experience in this gorgeous room, would highly recommend to all.",

Our waitress was very polite, professional, and sweet. We enjoyed a glass of champagne, 2 different teas, and a variety of tea sandwiches + sweets! My friend wasn't thrilled with most of the sandwiches, but the waitress kindly offered to bring out more of the cucumber ones she liked which was really sweet. She also let us know we were seated at Princess Diana's favorite table, which made the experience all the more memorable. It was pricey but a great experience, highly recommended for high tea.",

    "text": "Desserts for dinner! What more could you want!We went in a group to experience the lovely dessert menu options they offer. The menu offers several three, four and five course selections, with optional wine pairing, to choose from. And boy, is it hard to choose! Everything sounds so delicious.I chose the 3-course Memories Of A Child menu, which at the time included Gaspacho, Yozu Yogurt and a strawberry and cream lollipop. The atmosphere is quite airy and relaxed, so we chatted while eagerly awaiting our food.The Gaspacho came with \"molecular gastronomy\" style olive oil beads and olive crumble, delicately arranged on the Burrata, which unfortunately was swept and drowned in the cold soup they served on top. The watermelon and tomato paired very well together, the soup was slightly greasy and a bit oversalted, especially paired with an already salty ham and cheese pairing. The Yozu Yogurt was amazing, delicately flavoured Lego style bricks that were light and fluffy. Served with crunchy meringues, velvety sherbert, smooth lemon curd and a tangy lemon crumble. While the plate looked slightly messy, the tastes and textures were absolutely fantastic. This was definitely my favourite dish.The strawberry lollipop wasn't quite what we expected. The wooden lollipop stick came out immediately and didn't hold the almost runny dessert at all, making it impossible to pick it up and nibble away. As soon as the cold strawberry flavoured crust was broken, the creamy dessert inside ran all over the place. Awkwardly picking it up with the spoon worked to manoeuvre a mixture of creamy vanilla and poached strawberries into one's oral cavity. The following taste sensation definitely made it worth the effort of trying to eat this mess without spilling it everywhere. The dishes were definitely aimed at pleasing the eye, but the tastes and textures were not completely neglected. I did feel the price was a touch too high for what was offered and we ended up having seven meals on our bill when there were only six of us. This was corrected eventually, but only after we were accused of not paying our bill fully.Overall it was definitely an experience worth splurging on, I'll be back to sample more of their delicate creations!",

Beautifully seared tuna with a small quails egg, olives, green beans, salad leaves and a little fondant potato. Lovely ingredients though needed a little more seasoning. Overall would recommend BUT quite expensive for what it is. Only one vegetarian option offered too.We used a gourmet society card for 25% off total bill so ultimately good value.

And offered a glass of champagne on arrival ... Haha how did they know? Who let it slip? I am a champagne enthusiast!! Anyways as their tables are small and the larger ones were taken my friends and I sat separately but within reach! We all had the 4 course meal!! I chose allllllll desserts because it'd be stupid not to lol.. Started off with the Jaffa cake and white chocolate mushrooms on top of cookie crumb soil... Beautiful on the eyes and in the mouth!!!Course 2: the Eat Me Drink Me- which was a snickers inspired dessert! Very delcious however I was almost sugared out at this point ..my eye twitched and my vein on my left arm pulsed vigorously!!! Still I powered on! Course 3: The Queen Of Hearts (Champagne And Roses) - my favourite of the four for sure! It had everything !!! Delicious rose petals champagne foam dust of some sugary sort .. I mean wow .. Course 4: The Mad Hatter - this dessert was alcoholic through and through and I loved it haha! The cherry compote pipe was so yummy and though the cherry pieces were very sweet the alcohol balanced it out!! Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the moose thing on my plate ..the texture didn't sit well with me but apart from that I was in sugar heaven!!! Price wise \u00a342-60 but that's if you're going for over 3 courses \u00a0Impeccable service and delicious desserts ..I was a happy girl indeed!",
