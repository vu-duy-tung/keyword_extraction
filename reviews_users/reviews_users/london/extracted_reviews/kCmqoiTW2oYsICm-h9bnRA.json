It's located on a very small street so the seating arrangement was cozy, but comfortable. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We had several starters and I ordered the lamb curry dish. It was all absolutely delicious! I personally am not very familiar with Iranian food, but some of our party was quite knowledgable about the cuisine and confirmed its authenticity. Everyone at our table agreed that their dishes were phenomenal. I had a great experience!",

Being Iranian, we tend to crave kabob often, so we make it a point to seek out the best Iranian food in town (if it exists). We found it! Truly some of the best Iranian food I've had (no offense to my grandma). For appetizers, the four of us shared fresh bread and yogurt with shallots, and yogurt with cucumber. For entrees we had koobideh, barg, and the salmon entree. For the finish we had tea and baklava. Very delicious food and wonderful service, met with the most beautiful day on a cozy little street. I would definitely recommend and next time I'm back in London I'll be sure to return. Kheyli mam noon!",

The owner, Javad welcomed us kindly with his warm hospitality and delicious recommendations. He's been in business for 35 years! I had the salmon as my main and my boyfriend had the mixed grill. We were given two types of rice one was greenish with lentils and I think it also had olives-OMG I never had this type of rice but it was soooo good. Also loved the lentil soup, the hummus and the shirazi salad. The bread is served warm from a clay oven that the owner imported from Iran! \u00a0We finished with traditional iranian tea and baklava and Javad was kind enough to give me some tea to take home so i can make it myself! Highly recommend this place for ambiance, great \u00a0original Iranian cuisine, and such kind and welcoming hospitality. In a city where good food and service is hard to come by, Iran restaurant wins in all categories and I will definitely be making this place one of my to go to places.",

The owner seemed genuinely grateful for each and every customer, and we had a wonderful conversation with him. The restaurant is beautiful and the decor makes you feel like you're in Tehran.

There was no shortness of dishes. There was a total of 7 of us... we had 12 dishes.... not a single dish disappointed. I would highly recommend this restaurant in Mayfair. One of the best meals in London. Koobideh kabob was excellent. Thank you.",

Yep, this place is the real deal.The starter was a freshly baked flat bread with two dipping sauces - one yogurt/spinach/garlic sauce and one bean-tomato sauce. I mentioned that I like spicy food, but the gentleman said that other cuisines use spice to cover up the flavor, and he was right. There was SOOO much flavor in everything I tried, and none of it spicy. The flavors were deep and complex and totally incomparable to Indian or Moroccan or anything else I've tried.The main course was a lamb \"stew\" in a coriander sauce. A surprising kick were dried lemons re-softened by simmering in the sauce. They added a bright citrus flavor and just melted in my mouth.The gentleman gave me a piece of his grilled lamb to try, and it was also amazing - and this is coming from someone who doesn't especially like lamb.The service was wonderful, the experience of just trying whatever was recommended to me was unforgettable, and the \"discovery\" of a new-to-me cuisine was enlightening. There's a reason this place is routinely named among the best Persian restaurants in London, and I know I'll be telling all my friends about it.",
