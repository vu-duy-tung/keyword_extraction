    "text": "This Giraffe does have an outstanding location, on the South Bank right by the Thames. While the food is not the most amazing in the world, it does make a very convenient place for a reasonable meal. The first time I ate here was in the late afternoon/early evening, when their special-price two-course meal proved an amazing bargain. Choose from 3 or 4 starters and main courses (all of which appear on the ordinary menu, they're not cheap 'specials') for just under \u00a37; if you're drinking, a lot of cocktails are two-for-one at this time too! However, they did lose points for seaing me at the bar when tables were free - why do solo diners always get shoved here? The second time was with a friend and a young child, and this is where Giraffe probably comes into its own in the daytime. It has a nice children's menu, provides crayons and balloons, and above all the staff are friendly and laid-back. (As a result, Giraffe is popular with families and therefore perhaps best avoided in daytime if you don't have/love being screamed at by toddlers). This branch of Giraffe does its job well then, and while I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat there, it's certainly a great option when you are near one and want something reasonably priced to eat with friendly service.",

We ordered a chorizo chicken burger that was pretty dry (but good otherwise!!) and our beer battered onion rings never made it to the table. Thus the three stars. That being said, the NACHOS were amazing!! If i were to rate just them, 5 stars across the board as they hit the spot! We both thoroughly enjoyed them and added chorizo into the mix. It was a sliced chorizo that looked like salami which added a lot of flavouring to the whole pile. Beans, corn, cheese and chipotle flavoured tortilla chips made the appetizer a heaping mound of deliciousness. We'd definitely go back to giraffe just to have a few rounds of nachos and some tasty margaritas.",

More a coffee shop vibe than that of a restaurant, but I suppose that tends to fit in with the Giraffe theory anyway. Honestly, I've never been to a Giraffe for anything other than breakfast. I go here when I crave a bit of Americana in the mornings. The pancakes are FANTASTIC - fluffy and perfect covered in wonderful fruit and maple syrup. They offer freshly-made juices and international coffees. The Mexican-style egg tostada is almost one of my favorite dishes - eggs, chorizo, salsa, black beans and cheese grilled on top of a large corn torilla. Usually my husband and I split these 2 dishes, because I can never decide! The Belgian waffles are also very lovely & they do a mean granola! Around \u00a320 for food and coffees/juices for 2, it's not a builder's breakfast, but worth it for a Sunday brunch treat. Always had good service, though occassionally a bit slow if there's not enough staff on.",

The kids' menu is well priced- my companion has a bigger appetite than me so I we ordered one adult burger and one kids' and then did a swap. The burgers, a salad, two drinks and one kids' dessert came to \u00a320 which is reasonable but my burger was burnt and even the adults' portion came with very few fries. I think the food let them down this time.But it's still a great place to bring kids- we didn't feel rushed out of there and the crayons and activity sheet they provided were a useful diversion. As there is a general buzz about the place you can play games etc at your table without disturbing the people around you at all.",

They appear to market themselves as a family friendly restaurant but a friend was informed by their manager that they aren't family friendly - they are a regular restaurant that allows families. ALWAYS a long wait, often bad service - food is overpriced in my opinion and my friend's family was treated appallingly and made to sit outside in the freezing cold just because their toddler had a tantrum (and who hasn't had that happen to them). I'd skip Giraffe and do Strada or Wagamama's instead!",

Opening a Giraffe, as well as many other decently priced restaurants in the South Bank, just below Royal Festival Hall, was a brilliant idea as it gives concert and event goers the perfect place for that pre-show dinner. This Giraffe is certainly an excellent choice for such an occasion. There is always a good variety of choices on the menu, suited to most tastes, and the service is usually quite friendly and efficient. There are often special to be found if you register on their website and there is one day in the week (I forget if it's Monday or Wednesday) when wine is buy one get one free, which is well worth it!",

The wine was very welcome, and the view of the Esso Building and South Bank promenaders was wonderful.However. the falfafel :-) First, I foolishy (and selfishly) took the entire piece from the Mezze dish and ate it. Then, feeling queasy, I stopped chewing, and waited until a suitable interval when I could go to the toilet to dispose.I spoke to the kitchen staff, saying I did not wish to make a fuss in front of my friends, but that I had found the falafel unpleasant. I was offered fresh falafel to taste, which I agreed was absolutely fine, but they also conceded there was something very wrong with the falafel on our plate. I was given no explanation, except to find no charge for the Mezze on the bill.So for that, Giraffe, nil points.",

Giraffe on the South Bank has an enviable location and they seem to take it for granted that they'll be busy regardless of quality of food or service. On my first visit we didn't even get any food. It was a late night after a visit to the National Theatre and it put a dampener on the whole evening. We were told that they were still open but that we'd have to be quick and we were left standing there for 10 mintes trying to get the attention of any staff members. We left without even getting a table. On our second visit we were with friends who wanted to go so we tagged along. This time we were served but the food was well below par. I had a tortilla wrap which was soggy and stuck to the plate and a friend had a burger which had the just thawed cardboard texture. When there is so much choice along the South Bank I'm at a loss as to why this place is always so busy. Plain food and indifferent service.",

Their lunch and dinner menu is also great, with delicious burgers normally stealing my vote.

The food is very good with a variety to suit. Portion size is quite large with the possibility of purchasing side dishes if necessary. The staff are very helpful without bothering you. Keen to find you an appropriate table, provide drinks and menus and clear tables quickly. Be prepared to queue, it does get busy and if visiting during peak periods you may need to wait, but I would recommend this - Service and quality excellent and during summer months it is very pleasant sitting outside.",

As a restaurant it's nothing special, but it's good just to come in from the cold and chat over dessert, or a selection of their sides. Giraffe's food is cheap diner-stlye and the decor is a cheap idea too, but the diverse, vibrant ambiance of the area seems to creep in here nicely.Their salads are a bit of a disaster, with each one I've tried being very lacking, but sharing a few dishes from the 'Starters and Nibbles' menu can work out well. By far the best thing on the menu is the Toblerone style cheesecake, if you have the munchies this really hits an untasteful spot.",

We all met there after a scavenger hunt across London, and my fellow King's College exchange students and I shared a few drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of four group to arrive. I tried a South African cider that was very good, but kind of pricey.I passed by the restaurant quite often as it was very close to King's College London's Strand campus, and it was ALWAYS packed. Probably with tourists. It was a good choice for large groups because the seating arrangements were very flexible (they could just push tables together), but the restaurant wasn't anything special. Our server had to deal with a huge group with lots of special requests, but he was a good sport about it. Giraffe reminded me of all the typical American chain restaurants and served pretty typical American chain restaurant-type food. Even though I thought the name and design was cute, I never felt the urge to eat at another Giraffe while I was in London. It just wasn't that memorable of an experience.",

Wasn't spicy, rather bland had to add salt, pepper and tabasco. Also had the chicken pot stickers. Again nothing to write home about.

The food's alright, usual giraffe menu, nothing amazing and verging on being over-priced. The wine I was recommended tasted like nail varnish remover. Which was a shame, really, as I needed something to wash down the dry wedges, which, might I add, were not what I ordered, but they 'forgot' to tell me they had run out of my first choice. Cheers. Not only that, but they do that sneaky thing where they very kindly add themselves on an 'optional' 12.5% service charge. I opted to remove that and just pay the bill. Ducks to avoid flying insults",

I don't have any qualms about it, but it just didn't stand out to me as being as innovative as it makes itself out to be.",

Well I don't think they can see to far because the food at Giraffe is pretty basic, the best thing on the menu are the burgers, but they are happy to cater to people with food allergies, vegans, and vegetarians. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and have a selection of smoothies which is novel in a London restaurant. It boasts to have a family atmosphere, so be prepared for kids. It is a little overpriced for the style of food but then it is on the Southbank in London among other heavy traffic areas. \u00a0 \u00a0 It it is a sunny day I would recommend sitting outside under the umbrellas.",

When we entered there were a few kids here. We asked for a booth and were seated fairly quickly. And then we sat and waited for 14 minutes before anyone so much as greeted us or brought us water. At 14 minutes I asked someone if we should leave or if they had someone working our table...I tried to be polite but the place was filling up.The menu was nice and I like the gluten free menu choices. Soo nice. We decided to stay. The food came quickly and it was fine...nothing special but good. By this time we were surrounded by kids..kids everywhere which would be fine if I wasn't on vacation for the first time without my 2.5 year old. But that not anyone's fault but my own...I realize that. \u00a0I think the waitress came by and did ask how our food was and we said it was fine but that we needed the bill. I was disappointed. This is the worst place we've eaten in London and we didn't leave the suggested tip amount which I have never in my life done. Terrible service. Friendly for kids and good location but I'd have been better off waiting for one of the other restaurants nearby to open at noon.",

Unfortunately when they arrived it wasn't what I had been expecting. The pancakes where rather dark and dry, my local supermarket sells much better ready made ones.

The burger was dry and uninteresting, chips were fine but nothing special. I could have gotten better for the same price elsewhere. The service was pretty slow and we waited way too long for our check in the end. A few of my friends did like their meals though, so maybe I'm just being harsh.

Maybe I just don't like the venue; this Southbank branch feels like a frenzied feeding factory where customers are just units who require nutrient injections. It is busy, too loud and too stuffy. I had dishes from the Feel Good Dinner Menu, and I think it should be renamed the Feel Meh Dinner Menu. The starter of sticky sesame wings was mediocre, and the main of Katsu Japanese pork schnitzel was just the wrong combination. It was too salty and mixing crispy schnitzel with soup noodles doesn't make any sense, becoming sodden and floppy like sticks of brown meat sponge. The dessert of chocolate eclair cake was agreeable, but as a choux pedant, there was nothing eclair about it. A profiterole maybe but eclair is misleading. The service was bizarre too. The waiter lingered at our table for far too long. Awkward banter is one thing but once that is out of the way, standing there pointlessly while we stare at him to leave is definitely off-piste in terms of waitering. He'd then saunter over to the bar, turn his back, bow his head, and prod away at something at waist level. There were clearly people around us wanting service. He did this several times. He's either checking for unusual lumps down below, or prattling away on his phone, both of which are unacceptable in my books. \u00a317 for this experience was far too much and I think I'll be giving this branch, and this chain, a wide berth next time round.",

Melon margarita was okay, not really tasty enough in terms of the melon but there was alcohol so that is always good. Coconut shrimp appetizer was good with a nice spicy sauce to dip in the shrimp. Kids however didn't take to it (strange, see Bao review), Our little girl didn't like her pizza which was a bit strange, strips of bread, with some tomato sauce and melted cheese on it. Our little boy did however like his pasta and downed most of it, the little remainder his sister finished, cool! Others had the fish (no comments) and \u00a0spicy lentil soup which was \"very good\", salad which seemed okay. Oh, yeah, I had the jambalaya with seafood. An okay dish, maybe 2 1/2 start dish. Wasn't great but wasn't bad either. Oh, I guess that adds up to mediocre, right? So conclusion? I thought it was a disappointing experience since given its location, prices, crowd and noise there would be more substance to the food. Oh, well, live and learn.",

    "text": "I am surprised to see the reviews of Giraffe. I stayed down the way at the Marriott County Hall and walked the shops along the Thames each day. Friday evening I stopped in Giraffe for an evening dinner and was in time to order the \"Giraffe Time Menu\" which provided a starter & an entree for 8.45 \u00a3. There were three of us in our party - two ordered the daily soup (carrot & coriander) and the English Burger with fries. I ordered the hummus with warm naan and the farmer's market vegetable burrito. Arriving at that time I also was able to take advantage of the Bar Buddies which offered certain drinks at 50%. I ordered the acacia tree white wine from South Africa for 2.17\u00a3, The drinks arrived first and the wine was excellent. Sweet and refreshing. The soup arrived with focaccia bread. I did have a sample and I thought it was wonderful - of course it was also bone-chillingly cold outside, so the warm soup was a welcome relief. The hummus and naan was also good. When the main entrees arrived, we could barely eat it all. The burgers were large and the fries excellent. The vegetable burrito was huge and well-stuffed, topped with lettuce, cucumber and radish, and a sauce that set it off right. The decor was very cool and the staff polite and helpful. The dinner was so nice, we returned for Sunday afternoon lunch. Without a discount menu to choose from today, we ordered from the lunch menu, which also included brunch until 4pm. One person in the group ordered barbeque chicken & cheddar quesadilla, another chicken, bacon & brie on a baguette with fries, and I went with the brunch menu and chose the full breakfast. At only 7.75\u00a3, the later provided a great bang for the buck - 3 slices of multi-grain toast, baked beans, fries, 2 fried eggs, a sausage and some country ham. The Friday meal was about 36\u00a3, and today was just over 32\u00a3 - not bad for three people, I thought. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, the friendly staff, the food and the area. I would say I would go back, but obviously I did in returning for lunch today. One good experience I might consider it a fluke based on the other reviews, but with two visits and two good experiences, I can't say that. I enjoyed my visits here and next time I am in London I would definitely stop by this location or another Giraffe.",

So we looked up and down the lane by the eye and looked for what looked good, I am picky, and what was even open at 11 am. We popped into Giraffe and man, we should've kept walking. My gf and I both love giraffes and too it as a \"sign\" that we had to eat here and they still served breakfast so it all should've been a plus. We were say down by the short pixie style blonde and then that was it. I am not joking, that was it. We say and waited for fifteen minutes, with no greet, no water, no \"hi I'll be right with you\"",

    "text": "REASONABLE FOOD. OK SERVICE. POOR SEATING.Giraffe, despite its name, is not a children's restaurant - although it is very suitable for children. I took a group of 12 adults for lunch here. Firstly, they noted my booking name down wrong so it took a short while before we could sit down. It's times like these that you do wish places would employ good English speakers to take down bookings and to sort things out when they go wrong.The size of the table they provided us with was not adequate for 12 adults and we uncomfortably squeezed together. I don't like it when restaurants put their own greed ahead of the comfort of their customers and this was certainly true, especially when you combine the too small table with the child size seats that may look funny at first but aren't later when your legs start hurting.The menu was varied and interesting to all ages. Our waitress quickly got us some drinks and the service was quite brisk - polite but not friendly. Everyone got what they ordered. The food was not amazing but generally OK and no-one thought it was bad.Overall, an OK experience that would have been much, much better if they were more realistic on the body dimensions of adults.",

    "text": "I decided to have lunch here with a friend and was somewhat skeptical at first, from previous experiences I find restaurants that do a wide range of different cultural foods usually cook the food at a mediocre level. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at giraffe, I ordered the sirloin at medium-well and the steak was cooked perfectly and had delicious juices flowing from it with every cut. The garlic butter complimented the flavours of the beef, making it moist as it melted in my mouth. It was incredibly aromatic and flavoursome. I underestimated the green salad, it did not taste as plain as it looks. It was very refreshing and the dressing made it very tasty, a great way to cleanse the palate. The olives I had for starters where scrumptious, I like how they had a range of olives, that were deliciously tangy.Service was excellent, the waitress was very quick and attentive with our orders. The price was fair the bill came to about \u00a350.00 for the both of us. Overall, no complaints.",

We were in view of several staff who were standing around talking to themselves. The out of 3 food orders only one was correct, and one had to be sent back.

But I wouldn't go back - no way - and nor would I recommend this place to anyone.I ordered a salmon salad and the salmon was frozen! It came with potatoes that tasted like flour and it was drenched in a mustard dressing that didn't complement any flavour. I specifically asked for dressing on the side and it came on top :( But I didn't send it back as it took ages to arrive.My friend had a chicken and mango salad. Sounded tasty on the menu but came with a dressing that tasted disgusting. Apparently it was tequila dressing. Who puts tequila flavoured dressing on a salad??? We're not Ozzy Osbourne!Took ages for food to arrive and ages to get the bill - I was in a bad mood by the time we left and I normally like to leave a restaurant in a better mood than when I entered.

Also, everyone seemed to be happy with their meal choices so it is another plus. I'm giving them 4 stars because they processed our group and food really quickly and the serving team was nice, not because the food was above average.

My meal was cold and even though I ordered a strong coffee, it was extremely weak. Usually the wait staff is a highlight at Giraffe, though our waiter tried disagree with us there there wasn't a glutton free option for an order my friend made, even though it was clearly stated on the menu. \u00a0Massive fail.

So, not having decided beforehand (always a mistake to 'spontaneously' find somewhere when in a group), we gave in and plumped for a chain. Never anything too special, but a nice option. Side point, describing something as nice may possibly be the most politically non-descript thing you can say; it wasn't worth commenting on but you sound like you're being positive. Ick!We got in just before 7pm so found 50% off certain drinks. Making the most of it, I tried a mango and lime daiquiri and an apple and elderflower martini. The former was better as it tasted like fruit was used to make it, the latter was diluted apple juice frankly. We also got some nibbles, worth a try are the quesadillas - the remainder of the food menu is overpriced.3 stars over 2 for convenience and half price drinks, I would likely make a plan first to go somewhere a bit more special.",

Sadly we were seated in a booth in the very furthest corner so couldn't enjoy the river views - but we weren't complaining, more just happy to get a seat. We got the feed we were after - I can't say it was particularly inspiring or exciting, but it did the job in satisfying some of the fussier eaters I was with. My burger was ok and the sweet potato fries delicious (can always rely on them!). Annoyingly we'd missed their half price 'bar buddies' cocktails time pre 7pm but maybe that's something for next time. The service was a little flustered as you'd expect given the number of people in there and one of our orders arrived about 5mins later than all the other mains. It was tough to get their attention too but that might've had more to do with being seated in a back corner. Nothing unforgiveable then - but nothing to make me rush back either.",

    "text": "I popped into the Southbank branch of Giraffe following a recording of 'Have I got News for You' at the ITV television studios. It was rather late- almost 22:00- and we were desperate for dinner, so we were pleased that the restaurant was still busy and we easily got a good booth seat. I have been to several branches of Giraffe across London over the years (even the days before it was bought out by Tesco) and have visited this branch before. The Southbank branch is admittedly my least favourite because it is expansive and always filled to capacity due to its location- I've had incidents there where I have been waiting lengthy periods of time for my server who was desperately attempting to explain the menu to non-native English speakers! So, yes, expect a mostly tourist crowd here.On this visit, the service was very sluggish as it was towards the end of the evening- it took some time to get drinks, our food and our bill. Items were brought over to our table that we didn't order and side items that we did order were delayed and came some time after our mains. It was a bit frustrating when we saw our meals walk past us several times before they were placed in front of us (we were famished)! Our server was friendly (and dramatically mispronounced 'quinoa', bless him). \u00a0The Giraffe menu always has some of the same 'favourite' dishes and a few new additions depending on the season. It prides itself on offering a good selection of International dishes, such as: thai curries, jambalaya, mezze, a good selection of burgers, peri-peri chicken, burritos and grills. It has a great selection for vegetarians and even gluten-free options are clearly marked on the menu.I ordered the 'bunless' burger with a grilled chicken breast on a bed of quinoa salad with salad leaves, avocado, tomato and a burger sauce on the side. I usually enjoy the bunless burger salad on offer at the Burgers and Cocktails spin-off sister restaurant, but this version isn't as satisfying- it was colourful and fresh, but a little dry and I found myself adding hot chili sauce for a kick of flavour. The 'burger sauce' was a non-descript pink creamy concoction that I didn't particularly like. It is a good light option, but was missing any bold flavours. I saw the Global Mezze Platter pass our table and it looked absolutely delicious (I had been tempted to greedily order this sharing platter for myself, as I am always happy with mezze).My boyfriend had the Mexican burger- a new addition to the Giraffe menu with chicken and chorizo alongside traditional Mexican accompaniments. It came with hand-cut fries and he ordered more wedges on the side (again, we were famished). I was disappointed that the wedges didn't come with a dipping sauce and he resorted to the ketchup on the table.They were still seating people as it approached 23:00 and it took us ages to get our bill and pay, so it was a bit of a frustrating end to the meal.This is my least favourite branch of Giraffe, so I would recommend it only if you are meeting near Waterloo or stuck on the Southbank. Our Picturehouse membership card worked here and we got a 20% discount off the meal (even the server was surprised, as they do not always accept all discounts and vouchers at this branch). The service is not up to the usual standard of Giraffe due to the busy location and the amount of tables. The service was slow and our food was slightly cold when it finally arrived because of the various delays.I would recommend this branch for families, as they do cater very well to children and have a good kids menu and prices are very reasonable, especially if you are eligible for a Picturehouse or NUS discount. The food always looks attractive and vibrant on the plate and there is a range of healthy, vegetarian, gluten free choices. The standard across the Giraffe restaurants is also fairly consistent, but do try another location if you can!",

Although I prefer my bacon cooked a little more, it was a good breakfast and a good cup of coffee.The rest of their menu features cuisines from all over the world, including Asian, American, Indian, Mexican, Turkish, and more. Interesting or confusing? Hmmm...Overall, the service was good. The washrooms and the rest of the place was clean. Prices were very reasonable.",

    "text": "The madness they call Giraffe is a chain of restaurants that cater to families, very reminiscent of the Rainforest Cafe. We dined here with 4 adults and 3 toddlers on a cold day. I mention the cold because the queue to dine was a long line outside, wrapped around the restaurant! Ironically, when we were ready to be seated, we opted to sit outside because we had already been outside for 20 odd minutes, why not get to eating instead of waiting even longer for an inside table?! Plus, there were space heaters so that made it a lot more tolerable. The menu offered all different kinds of cuisine (which may or may not be a good thing). I decided to have steak and chips and an espresso martini (hey, I'm on holiday). The rest of the group had ribs, burger, burrito, and the kids had spaghetti, burger, chicken strips (all from the kid's menu). Strangely, they ran out of fish & chips on this day...My steak and chips was cooked a perfect medium. This American would've preferred A1 sauce instead of brown sauce (this wasn't a high-end filet, after all) but even without any sauce, it had a nice flavor to it. Espresso martini had just enough of a caffeine and alcohol kick to it, this was good. Service was super friendly but kind of chaotic. A place like that, what with kids and balloons and crying babies, it's to be expected. While I wouldn't be in a rush to return on my own, it's a good place to take your kids. No one will care if they are acting up or screaming/crying, and they have alcohol.",

So not at all a balanced meal, three starches and pinch of chicken. The only saving grace were the cocktails which were really nice. Only once we wanted a second one, it took ages for someone to bring us the list back, so we stole one from another table. Then we waited a really long time for someone to take our order.

    "text": "The decor is pleasant with a glass front overlooking the river Thames. Wooden tables throughout with a semi open kitchen and tasteful lighting. Outside seating available but not recommended unless it's summer. \u00a0 My friend had one of the burgers which was presented well, tasted good and was average value for money at \u00a310.95 plus \u00a31.00 to upgrade to sweet potato fries. \u00a0 My choice was more expensive at \u00a316.95 the same price as a sirloin steak. I ordered smokey BBQ ribs America style. Unfortunately when my meal came out it was just a small rectangle of meat placed on a bone with the tiniest drizzle of BBQ sauce. Definitely not what I was expecting for the price I paid and from the title. Ribs suggests more than one for certain. The skinned fried were adequate and the meat was nothing special. I definitely would not have this dish again and was disappointed though my friend enjoyed hers. I have had breakfast here before which was lovely, so this was a bit of a disappointment. Service was also slow, we were not offered a desert menu and didn't get a single check back. Better luck next time Giraffe!",
