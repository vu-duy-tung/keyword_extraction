I can't vouch for the food, but if it's anything like the service, it must be inedible.Appalling service, seedy atmosphere. \u00a0It feels a bit like a depressing brothel. \u00a0I'd advise discerning diners to avoid this place at all costs.",

    "text": "Whenever I have friends in town visiting or I want to show a colleague a good place to go after work I ALWAYS take them to Aqua.However, the reason for this is that this one of very few non-members bars with a roof top. The view is amazing and when you go out there to watch the view over Regent St, you feel a tiny touch of VIP. The dress code by the entrance helps to give the place a classy impression. You can't here the traffic a few floors down and it feels like you are on holiday on a beautiful day.When it comes to the bar I am not impressed. Many local bars in the Soho area are way better with way more skilled bartenders. The Bartenders at Aqua are not bad, not at all, but at same time as you order an amazing Cosmopolitan for your lady friend, your Mojito could taste and look like it came straight from war zone.The dinner food at Aqua Kyoto is very expensive but good. I usually go there for lunches when I can get the best bento-box I have ever tasted. I am especially impressed by the grilled salmon which is always perfect. Also, quite often there is enough space to get a table out side in the sun.All in all I go here for drinks in the evenings and lunch during the days. I wouldn't go here if it wasn't for the roof top(s). Remember to put nice shoes on to get in.",

I've eaten at the Japanese fusion style restaurant before. Similar to the bar, it's OK but more style than substance, especially for the price.",

    "text": "Infinity Brunch Club Outing #1: Aqua Kyoto.Aqua Kyoto was our inaugural outing for our Infinity Brunch Club. (Infinity drinks? Sign me up.) For \u00a355 they will give you a selection of Japanese food with infinity Veuve Clicquot champagne for two hours. (If you don't want the champagne, you can just get the food for \u00a335, but it doesn't seem worth the price if you don't get the booze.) Some of our party was a bit late, and we were warned in advance that if we started the infinity champagne, the countdown begins for them as well. So we waited five minutes (because we're terrible friends) and started it up.I've been to infinity brunches before, and I was slightly worried that a) they wouldn't fill our glasses up very often or b) they'd cut us off prior to the two-hour time period. Luckily, they held true to their word and we were not cut off. (Although in retrospect with how the rest of the day went, it probably would have been a smart decision on their part.) I was really impressed because my glass always seemed full, and there were only a couple of occasions where my glass was empty for more than a minute or so. So bravo to Aqua Kyoto!So the food consisted of Edemame and Miso soup to start. Followed by a giant sharing platter of sushi nigiri and rolls. We then were given a seaweed and tomato salad and a mushroom noodle dish. This was followed by meat and asparagus skewers (and some mushroom one for the non-meat/fish-only eaters) and some mochi for dessert. The food was fairly good, but nothing amazing or outstanding. But in all honesty, while we were hoping for amazing food, we were really there for the infinity drinks. Because infinity drinks.So the first outing was a resounding success! We all left full and more drunk that we should have been allowed to become (given then issues we had at the next stop we went to), and we all had a grand time catching up and getting to know new people. Given the amount of bubbly we polished off, I wouldn't be surprised if they raise the price soon or stop doing it all together, but run in soon and have a Japanese Sunday drunch!",

For the pesky-tarians like myself there were skewers of charred mushroom and asparagus. \u00a0Then final course was dessert, mochi, little ball of ice cream in a gelatinous shell of what I'm assuming is rice starch or somehting. \u00a0not very appetizing.So, in my from my experience, Aqua Kyoto is a beautiful venue. \u00a0Go for drinks but not the food. \u00a0That might explain how quiet it was, not the norm at venues offering infinity brunches.",

The sushi are exquisite, tempura are tastylicious (and not greasy at all !), the Udon noodles are crazy, etc. Amazing stuff (though a bit pricey, I admit).For desserts, you'll be spoiled with choice, but the panna cotta crumble is very unique, as is the combination of chocolate mousse and wasabi ice cream !On the down side, the service is nice, though I've known better...But hey, you'll want to stay there all night !",

    "text": "This place is one of a Hong Kong based chain that has some international outlets. It is part bar, part Japanese restaurant, part Spanish restaurant and part lovely roof terrace overlooking Regent Street. The place was very empty on a Sunday afternoon, so great for outside drinks on a sunny day. As previous reviewers have commented, it is all dark wood and chic low lighting. The decor is probably more suited to night time, and the loos were particularly badly lit (but chic-ly so). In the daytime, the dark entrance means that you could miss the greeter downstairs, who checks that you have a reservation before you ride the lift up to the 5th floor.We went for the infinity Sunday brunch at the Japanese restaurant. Basically \u00a335 for a 3 hour all you can eat starter buffet (sushi, some robata grill items, some fried items and udon noodles with mushrooms), followed by mains (a choice of chicken teriyaki, pork, squid tempura or a vegetarian dish) and dessert (ice creams, a selection of mochi ice creams or a chocolate pudding). Add \u00a320 and you have unlimited Veuve Clicquot champagne for 2 hours.The staff were efficient at topping up the champagne, so no complaints there, and the manager took pains to make good a mistake made by the reservation staff. The food, sadly, was just average. The sushi not particularly fresh, the pork main really quite forgettable, the chicken main passable and the squid tempura nice, not greasy, but bland. Desserts were the highlight food wise, although after a few glasses of champagne, a good afternoon was had by all.",

    "text": "* * * Update time! I previously gave this place four stars. I really liked it! Then I went again tonight. On my way out, I had decided I was going to drop them to a two. Why the drop? Thanks for asking! The quality of the fish had suffered, in my opinion. The tuna was the only sushi I ate that I didn't have to work to get through. The salmon was thick and spongy, the hamachi unimpressively chewy as well. I tried and immediately regretted a mackerel and ginger roll.Everything was just unpleasant. And the price seemed to have gotten higher. 10 pieces of nigiri, one cut roll, edamame, and some tap water. For 60 quid? Not worth it, at all.I won't be coming back. In fact, I think I might avoid sushi in London almost altogether. Why is it so hard to get it right here? I am not a picky eater, at all. Check out my rating distribution. I love everything! But sushi in London continues to disappoint me. Again and again.Anyways, back to my Aqua story. By the time I got back to my hotel, I felt nauseous. I threw up a few times and am now laying in bed with my eyes puffed up and my nice ladyfriend sending me well-wishing texts. I never throw up - I maybe have done this a total of 10 times in the past 20 years. And I drink often, too. So, I called the restaurant to let them know about my experience and they took my number to call me back, which they did just now. I figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt before I amended my review. The night manager told me that he spoke with a doctor and the doctor insisted that food poisoning cannot affect you until at least 24 hours after the meal.OK. Well. I just threw up after eating at your restaurant. Immediately after. Not related at all, really? At some point he asked me if there was anything I would like him to do. Hmm. Yeah. How about making me feel a little better about the $100 meal I just sent directly into my toilet? Drink some sparkling water to burp it all up, he suggested. Thanks, doc. One star, coming up.* * *What's not to love here, except the price? I've been three times now, twice for lunch and once for a drink. It's definitely on the more expensive side, but the fish is absolutely worth it. Very fresh, well prepared, and quite the variety. There's a LOT of pretentiousness on the way to your table. There's a hostess on the ground level when you walk in who attempts to make you feel guilty for not having a reservation. She then leads you to an elevator which has only one button, 5, for the 5th floor. Thanks for the help, lady.Then, when you get upstairs they're already expecting you, and they lead you in to the empty ass restaurant. Nice guilt trip. Expect to spend about 100 for two people, if not more. They have a nice rooftop garden area as well, but it's never been nice enough for me to want to sit out there.Drinks are north of 10 a piece. But, since every time I've gone here it's been for work, I don't mind the cost at all. Definitely check it out if you're a fan of quality sushi or if you like to spend a lot of money on things you don't appreciate.",

I had some wonderful taste sensations on our tasting menu. \u00a0That's where the fun ended though. We booked a special foraging set menu and my friend had a total of 8 emails about our booking. At no point did they mention that this option was no longer available after 7. This was made clear to us once we sat down however. The service was simultaneously attentive and uninterested.. we had one guy take our drinks order and then dissappear across the floor despite the time frame so then another guy took our food order. And so it continued. \u00a0A bill arrived on our table with no explanation. We asked where the bottle of wine had gone only to find it was in a bucket and had been there for presumably ages. We paid and were then told we had to leave our table at which point I said no, and asked for our wine to be poured. Finally the manager offered us a table in the bar area and explained they had another booking. Bearing in mind the pressure of a busy restaurant and this was still only 9.15 I think this needs to be clearly explained when you book this option.. so, food is excellent. Service simultaneously over the top and rude... There's better options in the area.. come here for lunch maybe?",

When you read the menu you are honestly expecting more, I was looking for a fusion of tastes and I got a barely spiced and flavoured dish.

    "text": "We visited Aqua Kyoto for a final meal in London before travelling onto our next destination. We decided on it at the recommendation of a friend and looking for something more distinguished as a goodbye.We booked our table online 6 days before our actual visit. We rang up in the morning to confirm and they had lost our reservation having no booking ever registered. When reading out our confirmation details they still could not find anything. After multiple calls they finally managed to seat us later that evening. The \u00a0service at this point was good and quite apologetic to the situation. Having said that this should have been our first warning.On arriving we went out to the deck for drinks and were met by a full bar with only one bartender meaning a long wait while she went through the pageantry of making the drinks.After we took our seat we had to wait a long time for our order to be taken and had to order many dishes a second time as they failed to get them the first time. To this we had to order drinks multiple times before they would come out. To their credit the bill was completely accurate and we were not charged for anything that didn't come to the table in spite of this.From here our meals came out and our appetisers were larger than our mains. The food was spectacular but could not fill our stomachs causing us to order further entrees.Overall the delicious food was overlooked by exceeding poor service in a restaurant where waiters nearly outnumbered guests and only half a full restaurant.For the price you pay you surely expect a certain level of service and to that a certain quality of food for the pounds paid. I would recommend skipping here and finding somewhere else to eat, London is a big place and you can do better for your money",

We sat down for dinner at the Spanish restaurant. It was 6pm. The place was empty. \u00a0We ordered martinis, a bottle of wine, starters and mains. I then asked the waiter if he could bring a tortilla over from the tapas bar. He said no, they can't serve tapas at the table. I was incredulous. I said call the manager over please. Manager said he same thing but added, if I make an exception for you, I have to make it for everyone. I've just ordered 200 quid worth of wine and food. Maybe a tortilla from the tapas bar in a restaurant that was 90% empty won't kill you. I almost left but my dinner companion soothed my nerves. What could have been a four star review is a two because of poor judgement.",

    "text": "So I have two parts to this review... the first part is for the bar and that is where the 4-stars comes in. \u00a0We decided to stop for drinks before dinner. \u00a0It is very dark, very chill, but lots of people. \u00a0The type of music they were playing was actually ok... I found myself swaying to the beat. \u00a0It took some doing, but we actually got a couple seats at the bar and got to watch the cocktail mixing show. \u00a0It really is a show! \u00a0Cocktails are really an art at this place!I stuck to the Gin and Tonic, but the drinks the other ladies had were quite the piece of work! \u00a0One had the Fiery Seniorita (I think that was what it was called)... it had some peppers and spice to it! \u00a0There was a Ginger Collins, which was really refreshing with fresh ginger, but if you get heartburn like I do, it is not good for that. \u00a0At some point they passed around some spring rolls! \u00a0How nice! \u00a0The wait for the Japanese restaurant was about an hour, so we decided we would head downstairs and make our way to another restaurant.When we got downstairs, it was pouring outside, so I asked one of the doormen, Albert (apparently not his real name) if he had any suggestions. \u00a0He told us about the Spanish restaurant... I think all of us said, \"What Spanish restaurant???\" \u00a0So we went back upstairs and told Christopher that Albert sent us. \u00a0Christopher was the guy checking coats. \u00a0He took us back to the restaurant, had a chat with the hostess, and we were promptly seated! \u00a0Lovely! \u00a0The restaurant is really expensive, but at a trendy place like this, it was to be expected.Paolo, our waiter was really lovely although he did botch our wine order and when he poured the wine into Work BFF's glass, she said, \"I thought it was a red wine!\" \u00a0He brought us the wrong one... but he took care of it and we ended up with a really lovely bottle of red. \u00a0We decided to share some of the tapas plates and a few of the veggie mains. \u00a0The croquettas were nice and bitesized, there was cheese and red onion jelly (however I cannot comment on the cheese as I am a lactard and thought the croquettas were enough cheese intake for the day), the Huevos Estrellada was amazing! \u00a0It was a poached egg on top of crispy small bits of chorizo and potato. \u00a0If that was a larger portion, that would be a great brunch item! \u00a0Then we had the Risotto and the Parcel with artichokes and mushrooms. \u00a0The Risotto was lovely... I believe it was mushroom with a bit of truffle... \u00a0The parcel was not what we were expecting. \u00a0They should call it a Deconstructed Parcel as the pastry was on one end of the plate with artichokes and mushrooms on the other side of the plate.At one point our glasses needed topping up, but our bottle of wine was on a table where the staff keep all the wines. \u00a0Then when we wanted to order more of some of the items, the kitchen was closed... but we were able to get dessert. \u00a0I will say that the dessert menu was not that great, but we got one because it was Work BFF's sister's birthday. \u00a0It was some kind of cardamom flavoured custard, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. \u00a0With two bottles of wine and the various dishes we ordered, our total came out to somewhere around \u00a3160.We went back to the bar to continue with drinks and be entertained. \u00a0Again we had no problem finding a couple of seats. \u00a0One of the bartenders made a shooter for Work BFF's sister. \u00a0We're still not sure what all was in it, but she said it was good! \u00a0Eventually the lights went up and it was time to go. \u00a0We were finishing up our drinks and the bartenders were wrapping up the fruits and things and one of them decided to cut up some of the pineapple and serve it to us. \u00a0Then one of the bouncers told us we needed to move and we just said that we were waiting in the bar area, finishing our drinks because there were lines for the elevators. \u00a0He told us we couldn't wait in there... lame! \u00a0Overall it was an enjoyable night, but EXPENSIVE! \u00a0Eat dinner before you go and just go to enjoy drinks and make sure you get up close to see them make the drinks!",

    "text": "The restaurant was very lovely, mainly because of the decor rather than the quality of its dishes. You reach the top floor of this building via the elevators as directed by the doorman and pause just outside the bar to hand in your coats and inform them of your reservations. Because of the bar, the noise levels of the entire place was akin to something in a nightclub, which was a shame. The bar area was incredibly busy but you had to walk through it in order to reach the restaurant, but there the noise levels did not alter in the slightest.Again, I must emphasise that the decor was really very lovely, all black and dark lighting with the requisite red lanterns here and there; the centre piece, which was a massive red hanging lantern, was behind the sushi bar (which also doubled on the bar side as the actual bar) and was really eye-catching and chic. It would be nicer if they put table cloths on the tables, as I despise 'naked' tables and it would go someway to help with the noise levels a little, especially if they also added some foam padding underneath the tables too. The floors were hard, dark wood so that does not help with noise.....It is rather unfortunate that the roof top terrace (no doubt offering you a wonderful view over Regent Street, and would have been lovely to stand outside with your drink underneath the stars with the lights of the city played out beneath your feet....had it not been raining cats and dogs when we went there....) is only accessible to all through the restaurant. So you had a queue of passerbys from the bar going past you for a smoke outside, which spoilt the overall elegancy of the restaurant. The bathrooms were unfortunately in the bar area so you also had to share that with the bar crowd, some of whom, I must hasten to add, appear to be rather trashy....The food was average, nothing to revel about, and was rather expensive. Needless to say, in London, you can find far superior food for much less....but it was an experience nonethless for the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant!",

I wish I spent more time taking pictures of the views, as they were beautiful and you can literally see the whole of London from where I was standing. The crowd is a little young; 20's -mid 30's and I would suggest going between Thursday's- Sunday's as these days seem to have a vibrant and buzzing crowd. My choice of drink was a pornstar martini made by an amazing Italian bartender, whose name I cannot pronounce but he did well. Very strong but yet so sweet! Next time I will definitely be going back to try their Sunday infinity brunch",

The ostrich was too tough, the scallops not crispy which didnt give enough dimension to the dish as the yomogi rice was bland. On the other hand the green tea soba was delicious but very classic in flavours.The ultimate fav was the desserts a great marriage of classic chocolate truffle and more adventurous flavours of wild herbs and sweet meadow ice cream.Overall I think it a good place to entertain people visiting or enjoying the rooftop bar but it wont be my go to place",

Upscale mood, with polished decor and a quasi Asian look without it being a theme. Trendy, with beautiful people yet not pretentious, it ticks a lot of boxes for a good formula. Good cocktails, and easy going.",

Then moved inside for dinner and they seated us in a nice cozy arc-shaped booth perfect for two. The service was extraordinary, the wine selection fancy, and the sushi was pretty close to the best I have had. Definitely recommend this place for pre dinner drinks at the rooftop and the amazing restaurant. Update: I have had dinner at Aqua Kyoto again and i can't say enough good things about this place. Manager Philipe is amazing and makes sure he takes care of his patrons. Love it!",

Kidding, I pay all my own bills children. Point is, the sushi here is delish, and it's inspired! I love inspired sushi, and for every cow in India please dont ask if they'll make you a fucking California roll, ya feel me. THEY WONT. Go back to whatever zone 23 Tesco you came from, and get a flippin corndog, it's better for all. Oh and hang out outside.

    "text": "After a disastrous dinner at Aqua Shard, I was a bit hesitant but decided to try this restaurant anyway. Fortunately Aqua Kyoto managed to deliver. The restaurant is a bit hard to find at first; after checking in with a hostess, elevators whisk you up to the 5th floor where the restaurant, bar, and terrace are actually located.Food was quite good, but not exceptional. There are some pretty standard items like gindara and tempura rock shrimp \u00e0 la Nobu (although the sauce is on the side, which does help to preserve the crunchiness of the tempura batter), as well as some more interesting and unique dishes. Although all our dishes were executed well, they ultimately failed to truly astound - for example, the truffles in the the truffled chicken and leek yakitori failed to elevate the dish, being mostly overpowered by the teriyaki sauce. On the other hand, the green tea and black sesame ice cream I had for dessert had plenty of flavor, highlighting the chief ingredients while avoiding being overly sweet or milky. Service was professional and decently friendly. Only a few several minor items, such as a lack of chopsticks at the table setting, and failing to replace plates promptly. The restaurant is fairly dark, with plenty of wood and a soft red lighting scheme throughout. There is a nice terrace that reportedly has nice views of London, although it was raining when I came. Noise definitely spills over into the dining area from the bar, and music is also louder than average as well. Aqua Kyoto manages to be a decent Japanese fusion restaurant. However, in my opinion, it is ultimately surpassed by other contenders such as Nobu, which manages to pull off both exceptional food and service much better than this place.",

They were all beautifully done and the creativity is not only in the visuals, but the tastes as well. They really brought out a true creativity and brought me back to Kyoto. Have to point out, ORDER the lamb chop grill, you will never forget that dish!Their wine list was great as well! I went for a bottle of Riesling, it is very fresh and not too sweet.

    "text": "Sushi? For brunch? With unlimited champagne?! Sign me up baby!!These guys had me at the concept. In fact, I think I got so excited I managed to overhype it for myself! A friend had booked it about 6 months in advance for her hubbie's 30th bday surprise, so I had far too much time to salivate over the menu online beforehand. I think she'd had a few issues with the booking given the largest table they'd give her was for 10 peeps and she was hoping for more (obv I made the cut though so it didn't bother me too much ;)We all rocked up even before they'd opened to make sure we got there before the bday boy (all being too scared of his wife to run the risk of ruining the surprise). As an unexpected bonus they offered to move our booking from the main restaurant to their private dining room. This *may* have had something to do with the fact that we had with us the cutest 6-month-old ever (fact), and they thought we might appreciate less bustle and extra space for the pram. They thought right!The restaurant is a lush blend of red, gold and black decor and low lighting that I guess is quite stereotypical but sexy. The 'private' dining room sits on one side, with a large circular table and coloured glass walls that mean you still feel part of (but more special than!) the main restaurant. It also meant we could see the bday boy's face as he arrived and saw us all waiting :)The (obvious) unlimited champagne option is now \u00a360, whilst the house wine/beer middle ground was \u00a350 and food-only for \u00a339 (for the teetotallers/breast-feeders). Despite having landed at Heathrow that morning after a 3-flight journey home from Asia, I determinedly got my value for money on the champers!A good job, as I don't think this was true purely on the food front. Tasty, beautifully presented and plenty of it yes, but not worth the food-only price. Highlight was probably the massive sushi platters that arrived with a beautifully bright range of maki and sashimi that had baby Evie trying to dive in headfirst from her mum's lap. I felt the same way. I possibly overdosed at this stage and on the yakitori, as by the time the noodles appeared I was bursting (though still had room for mochi at the end obvs).Our waitress was a model of patience, despite our indecisiveness over who wanted the champers and our very slow eating speed given the distractions of the gorgeous baby getting passed around. She also ensured no one's glass was ever more than half-empty and even gave us a heads up when our 2hr unlimited bubbles time was almost up so we could squeeze in an extra round. What a star.Lessons learned: 1) don't hype up a menu 6mths in advance, 2) champagne is always the right choice, and 3) consider accessorising with a baby more often...",

And unliited champagneeeeeeee! *come face*What a lovely image, I'm sure.My brother from another mother's sister's husband had his surprise 30th lunch here so we turned up, the 10 of us and hid in their special glass room while we patiently awaited the arrival of the guest of honour. Unbeknownst to him, we were ready to jump out at a moment's notice and yell 'SURPRISE' and hopefully not give him a heart attack or anything, but since we were in the aforementioned special glass room, though we jumped out he only saw the jumping action and didnt hear any of the 'yelling', though unfortunately, we did manage to scare a baby who then proceeded to cry. Oops.On to the food, we had......5(?)...a load of courses which started with sushi and sashimi and another course had very dreamy yakitori, not forgetting a noodle course and mochi as well.I love sushi so I had been kinda dreaming about this day for a few months. Alas, I have to say that I don't think that the food only price of \u00a339 was definitely fairly valued, though I do understand that there is a markup for location, decor (very pretty red and gold) and beautifully presented food (I love a bit of food porn) but I remember thinking that the flavours weren't quite up there as I was expecting to get at \u00a0restaurant off Regent St.The unlimited champagne however, adds another \u00a321 to your bill and is probably more worth it if you're planning on writing off the rest of your Sunday. The waitress attending to our sushi-themed needs was very lovely and gave us far warning when we were nearing the end of our 2 hour infinite champagne window and additionally ensured that we were all kept topped up.In fact, Imma gonna ramp this up to a 4-star review because she was so lovely. Would I come back? I loved the venue itself and they have a rooftop bar which I remember frequenting before this became Aqua Kyoto so I think I could be persuaded :)",

    "text": "Aqua Kyoto is one of those places which offer an experience, something more than just a Japanese dinner. First of all, you reach the top floor of the building by a private lift, doors open into a lovely reception desk were to hand in your coats and get info about your booking. A soon as we get into it, we realice the great atmosphere. The binchotan (Japanese charcoal) deco of the spirit bar roof surprised me in a positive way, it was a saying: robatayaki (Japanese grill)... Yeah!The decor was very lovely, all black and dark lighting, the centre piece, which was a massive red hanging lantern was just above between the sushi bar and the robata grill took my daughter breath away, the amazing music was loud enough to have a conversation and to create a nice atmosphere without dominating the entire experience. The service was simply outstanding, helpful and very friendly, they looked after us all night long with a big smile and sympathy. Regarding the food, I could tell you for sure they really know what they do... And they do it very well, because everything was amazing. We ordered some edamame as a appetizer while we took a look at the menu, suddenly after a couple of minutes we had them on the table, it was so fast that we couldn't believe it. We were recommended by the waitress, who kindly made some suggestions like the great hamachi jalape\u00f1o with Japanese plum or umeboshi, we decided to have a wagyu beef gyozas with onion miso and ponzu pearls, they were more than oishii (delicious in Japanese), loved the enoki kurobuta pork kushiyaki, it was so umami, the soft shell crab and the rock shrimp tempura were crunchy and well cooked, not oily at all, then they brought us a shiitake negi yaki (shiitake mushroom yakitori with garlic butter sauce) nice option for vegetarians, my little princess was more than happy with the otoro, sake and maguro sashimi, (3 pieces each) and for the salmon and tuna hosomaki as well, the sushi rice was perfect, the size, the taste for the salt, sugar and vinegar balance was more than excellent, it spread in our palate, I can not remember the last time that I eat a really good and well execute piece of sushi, domo arigato to the itamae.I did not drink sake that night but saw the sake list, it was very short, but had some good selection of Junami, Ginjo, Daiginjo and plum sake, they only have Kirin beer, not Asahi or Sapporo.For the dessert we went for the out of this world super amazing black sesame fondant, the first time that I see a kurogoma fondant, it took like 15 minutes, so be patient and the chocolate \"domo\" nice textures of ginger and chocolate mix.We had a really good time and experience, totally recommended.If you are visiting London, definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I love how Yelp gets people with similar interests together. In this case a group of us got together with a similar interest in getting drunk at lunchtime on a weekend on as much champagne as we could carry. Well, to me that's as valid an interest as knitting or football. The first place we decided on for this outing was Aqua Kyoto - I've been to Aqua Shard (a sister restaurant) for cocktails before and had a splendid time, so I was very excited to try this place out. Either that or I was excited at drinking as much champagne as possible in 2 hours with some friends. Or having lunch on the top floor of a Regent Street building. Nevertheless, I was excited!!The restaurant itself was smooth and sleek, with dark, rich colours that gave off the immediate feeling of opulence. Not a good start for me then wandering in wearing jeans. #LifeYelp there! But we were paying \u00a355 each for this brunch so to be honest I think we should be able to wear what we want. That sounds a lot of money, but I do think we got a pretty good deal, considering that the champagne was Veuve Clicquot and there was a really generous amount of food. We were also the first ones there, arriving so early that the restaurant wasn't even open. Well we were just SO excited!We were (wisely, in hindsight) given a corner table away from other diners, who were probably about to enjoy a sophisticated luncheon in between a morning of shopping and an afternoon of polo or such like. And after 2 hours of at least 3 bottles of champagne each, we were LOUD. Now in my view that is a positive thing - it means that the restaurant were very quick to keep our glasses topped up and would often refill the table when we weren't even out of alcohol. Got to love attentive service like that!The food (whilst my memory is a little hazy) was a really brilliant selection of Japanese sushi and noodles, including vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters of us. 2 huge plates of sushi between 7 of us as well as edameme beans, miso soup, mushroom style noodles, yakitori skewers, seaweed salads and even dessert. Can't complain about the amount of food or the choice and whilst other more discerning palettes had sampled superior sashimi I had not had anything better before or since so far. All in all, a pretty perfect brunch with a pretty perfect group of people (obviously, they were my friends!)",
