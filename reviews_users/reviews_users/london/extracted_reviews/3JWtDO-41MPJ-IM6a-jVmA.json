The decor was old-man pub-ish with lots of wood and plenty of room to sit down. The service was pretty speedy and very friendly. Oh! and after I had finished my first pint, we discovered cheese boards which made my whole world better. Woot!For some reason, last Friday night when we came here there was a huge number of blokes in this pub. But, this was good too- less queue for the ladies loos - yay!",

The weather was nice and there were also many people drinking outside and there was some kind of party atmosphere but we drank on empty stomachs as it was impossible to order any food.

It is within throwing distance of Old Street Station too, even if you have a weak arm and are suffering from tennis elbow. Has two entrances on 2 different streets so while it's sort of hidden, it is quite easy to find with just a vague idea of where it is. Many ales on tap (and not just the regular ones you see everywhere). They also have an extremely interesting selection of other beers. They even have the Alpine Lager which I have never seen outside a Sam Smith's pub before (not that you'd need it with all the ales, but it is above average as lagers go). It's an old fashioned pub with no screens, which makes it an excellent place to escape the football on big match nights. Has a beer garden for the summer months. The food looks very reasonably priced too, but I can't vouch for it yet. Check out the website for their latest guest ales. You can even follow their ale updates on Twitter!",

They surprisingly serve food (wish I'd remembered to eat - that would have balanced out the craft wobbles later on!) which a few friends said wasn't bad. They've also got the top deck set out as an open air beer garden which is a real strong selling point - nicely hidden but I'm happy to share it with fellow Yelpers :-)Get here - and enjoy - this area is slowly being swamped with chains so make sure this indi keeps shining through.",

And, of course, we weren't disappointed.I can see why so many people have walked passed without noticing it. It's the opposite of a shiny, polished gastropub. Not that it isn't quality - it is, just in an understated, comfy way. Venture in and you'll find a cosy layout, plenty of ales as well as some top nosh.The roof terrace is understandably popular and a little crowded. I probably wouldn't choose it for a quiet conversation or a date. But for a lively evening of cheerful boozing and eating it's perfect.With my blood sugar levels perilously low, I sought the most calorific, satisfying thing on the menu. Lo and behold steak with mushrooms and chunky chips saved the day.Tender meat, creamy sauce, crunchy salad on the side and some of the best fries I've ever tried - crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. So good, my sister kept nicking them - hands off sis!She'd ordered a halloumi salad, which was well presented and awash with vegetables, but I know she coveted my steak.My only quibble with this delightful pub is the lack of dessert options - ice-cream or cheese? Not so much. Still, if you're hankering for a thirst-quenching beer and a hunger-zapping steak with chips fit for the gods - you've come to the right place.",

I've walked past this pub no fewer than 500x since I moved to a flat nearby, but just never remembered to stop in. From the outside it is fairly unremarkable (though well kept, of course) -- but inside there is plenty of room, and of course the gem of a roof which manages to be secluded and lush with greenery, ample seating and sunshine when Mother Nature stops along to play nice. And, the food prancing about looked very promising. I'll remember that for next time. Real cask ales, some newer craft beers on offer, very passable wines, nice service and a pub menu a notch above the norm? Why aren't you here yet guys!? Pro-tip: reserve the large rooftop tables for a group if you've got your plans together to avoid disappointment.",

    "text": "We stopped here for something to hold us over, until dinner. It was during the afternoon, and was very quiet. We'd traveled by train from Broadstairs, by the coast, in Kent, and were booked into St Pancras Premier Inn. Well, the Inn was shut down, so they sent us to the Premier Inn on Old Street. This was way screwed up, as we had booked our room, so we would be right across from the British Library. We were already worn out from the train ride, so being sent to another Premier, made us rather cross? And the kitchen was closed until 1700, and happy hour didn't start until 1800 hrs, so off we go.This place turned up, not to far from our hotel. Great, as we were on foot. Her Ladyship went to the bar to place an order for us, while I went out back to take a photo or two. There was only one other customer at the bar. He was trying to chat up the lady pib keeper, with out success. We sat down with our pints, and soon the lady delivered our order. I won't say this lady was out right surly, but certainly not friendly by any stretch of the word. I waited for \"she WHO MUST be obeyed,\" to return, from the loo. I was looking at what she ordered, and thought maybe it was some kind of baked potato, cut in half? There was a small salad served on the side, cool.She returned, so it was time to snack. I picked up my half of whatever this was, took a bite, and oh my goodness. It took a few bites, before I even put it down to wipe my mouth, and get a sip of my pint. GOOD, Good, good!! Finally managed to ask what I was eating, and found out they were Scotch eggs. I was surprised, as I have tasted them once before, but nothing like these. So sad this was our last day, before going back to the USA. Would've like to return and tried there other beers, and food offerings. Also, it's kind of off the grid for where we usually lodge, but would definitely love to return sometime.",

In the heart of bustling old street, you genuinely would walk by thinking this place was closed on a quiet evening but if you head inside you're greeted with a truly British local experience. For me, this pub epitomises everything that a pub should be: friendly locals, British beers on tap and a laid back and relaxing atmosphere where you truly feel at home.Perfect for an afternoon or evening beverage. I opted for the house rose and it was delicious - not too dry and not too sweet.Sadly I didn't give the food a try but it looked delicious and smelt even better. I'll definitely be back to give those chunky chips a try that's for sure!",

Nice roof terrace - great for a lunch time catch up during the week and buzzing on a Friday evening. I would recommend their beetroot and goats cheese salad for a satisfying light bite but their burgers are pretty tasty if your after something more filling. My friend is also very fond of their cheesy chips. We will and have returned. It's perfect for de-stressing after a long days work.",

There is a chalkboard with the list, including the abv, brewery, location, as well as the price. It's also a pleasure just to walk the length of the bar and look at the pull handles. \u00a0For the less adventurous, there are plenty of lagers, ciders and the usual selection of spirits. The wifi is free and there's a code posted above the bar in the second room. Pricing is reasonable by London standards.",

In addition to the beers on the list in my photo, Old Fountain also had several taps that I believe are their \"standard,\" non-rotating beers. Old Fountain also had a tv where our friends could watch the Wimbledon semi-finals.The only really sketchy thing about Old Fountain was how many people were drinking outside, not just directly outside the pub as is typical, but also across the street in this abandoned lot. It was very odd to behold.",

Good selection of drinks, classic and well presented pub food (chicken burger was excellent) and your obligatory roof terrace (well we are quite near hipsterville) for those few and far between days of sunshine. The pub itself is fairly dark and most people head to the terrace during the summer months but I can see this being an equally great place for those long winter evenings when all you want is a pint and a burger to warm you up! Staff were friendly, food was served fairly quickly (even during a busy lunch hour on a Friday) and the standards were good. Nothing wrong here!",
