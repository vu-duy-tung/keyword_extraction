A fresh new concept to cheer up these worn out blocks.The coffee is amazing and the service has always been more than kind. I have tried out the breakfast that they serve only during the weekends. Impressive. Also the deli selection beats the local super markets and it is a great place to get also ingredients for cooking at home.",

    "text": "Where I come from, Brunch is an Institution (see, I even spelled it with an upper case 'B' and 'I,' just to show you I mean business). Being that in London, it...well...isn't, I didn't think I'd be able to find a comparable, chic-but-friendly neighbourhood brunch spot, where I could enjoy an overpriced omelette and glass of OJ in style. I was wrong! Franz\u00e8 & Evans has been on my radar of places to go for a while now, as it is strategically located next to BrewDog (my favourite place on Earth) and thus always in my literal/figurative line of vision, and it almost always has a massive queue. And we all know queue = good stuff here. So, one fine Sunday morning (and by 'fine,' I mean hopelessly miserable and grey), a friend visiting from NYC (the original and most vigilant Brunch Capital of the World) and I braved the queue and made it into Franz\u00e8 & Evans. The best part was, we didn't even really have to wait in a queue -- one of the servers took my name and number, and gave me a ring when there was space for us to be seated. Meanwhile, we perused the wonders of Brick Lane market, a foolproof place to kill some time. Once seated, we were approached quite promptly by a server who asked us for our orders. Since the brunch menu only has about 12-15 items, it didn't take too long to choose what we were getting -- for me, the French omelette with parmesan and rocket, and spinach added as an extra, and for my friend, the green omelette, with pesto, sun blush tomatoes, and rocket leaves as well (it usually comes with ham, too, but she asked for it to be omitted). We also ordered an Americano and an OJ, respectively.While waiting for our food, I had a look around at the decorations, which were appropriately country-chic -- painted watering cans were used as vases for bright yellow flowers, wood hewn tables and chairs, white wooden paneling on the walls, and lots of bright lights that made the space cheery and comfortable. It also made me want to nestle and eat, so it was a good thing our food came out soon afterward. Let me just say that while my omelette was fine (cooked quite well, and rather pretty to look at, to boot), I had MASSIVE food envy at my friend's dish. They put pesto in the egg mixture itself! It's not just a filling! My life has been changed forever! However, I was contented to just try a bite of hers for now, and know quite firmly that I'll order that same thing next time I come in. Plus, I wasn't charged for the extra spinach I asked for on my omelette, which was a nice change from being charged for even an extra poppy seed on a muffin in the BrunchLand of Los Angeles.Also, the bevvies. They are usually a throwaway at brunch, used solely to wash down the heaps of eggs, potatoes, and other, more important brunchy tems on your plate, unless they are of course bottomless mimosas, which I suppose are also a throwaway in a different sense (because you throw away as many as you can into your belly, har har). They were worth every penny at Franz\u00e8 & Evans, however. My Americano was the greatest Americano I've probably ever had -- rich and deep in flavour, not too acidic, and not the odd burnt coffee powder water that I've gotten accustomed to drinking, thanks to Certain Establishments with green circular and red star logos. Ahem. My friend said her orange juice was comparably delicious, although it looked like it had some pulp and I don't jive that way (not my cup of juice, if you will...har har again). Anyway, they were really good and the hype by other reviewers is well justified.Two things that made this a four-star rather than a five-star experience:One, the dishes are served with what is advertised as 'sourdough bread.' Whatever I ate with my omelette today was NOT, in fact, sourdough bread. It was just a piece of crusty bread that maybe looked a bit like sourdough, but was not...well...sour (don't mess with a Californian on this, sozzle). Two, since it was really hectic this morning and there were a lot of customers (and not too many staff), service was unfortunately a bit spotty. We asked for glasses of water numerous times and didn't get them in the end, and I asked for tomato sauce and Tabasco twice and ended up having to steal them both from a nearby table. Other than that, though, all good things here. I need to come back and try the illustrious courgette cake (they didn't have it today, sad times), more likely than not with a large, steaming cup of the nectar of the caffeine gods that they sell here. Oh, also, I checked in on Yelp and got a deal for 5% off my next lunch bill here, which means that I'll get to try some of the delicious salads and other entr\u00e9e dishes that they have freshly made and displayed near the register area. Yay.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review over some reluctant pangs. I don't actually want you to know about Franze & Evans. Sorry.F&E is a small place, and another good review on Yelp might mean less room for my Observer on the table next to me. Last year it was easy to get a table on Sunday mornings, but that's not the case these days, so my review embargo seems increasingly pointless.Franze & Evans is ostensibly a deli. The blackboard in the window misdirects you with a chalked claim to the best coffee in Shoreditch (I don't disagree) and one entire wall is devoted to specialty foods to take home - though attempting to use their ingredients to replicate what they do is downright Quixotic. No, Franze & Evans is a restaurant, and the food is without equal in this part of town. Leave the cooking to them. There's a tall, bespectacled gentleman there every time we visit who emits the aura of being the owner. He is genuinely charming and gregarious - whether he is Franze or Evans we haven't asked. The rest of the staff is generally pleasant and competent, though we've had a few americano orders appear at the table as cappuccinos. The menu is printed on a single sheet of A4 paper and changes week to week and there are daily specials on the board behind the counter that you have to lean to peer around Franze (or Evans?) to see. There's a couple of stalwart items that never leave the top of the menu. One is \"poached eggs with bacon or ham on an English muffin with hollandaise\". Eggs Benedict, in other words. But what an eggs Benedict. The bacon is always perfectly cooked to give a textural balance to the perfectly soft eggs. The yolks that come out when you cut into those eggs are so golden that after you've had them once you'll look at any egg yolk you see outside of F&E with pity. Or suspicion. I could go on about the eggs Benedict for another couple of paragraphs, but I won't. Just go to F&E and have them for yourself. And I'll try not to crowd you too much with my newspaper.",

I only say that because as they are friends they naturally had a bit of chat when we arrived, something along the lines of 'how are you'? Anyway it transpired that this girl was tired and she was very tired because it was 'market day'. I took this to be both a good and a bad thing. Good because I assume it meant I was lucky enough to be in on a day when everything had come in fresh from the market. However, I wonder, how often actually is market day? If she was especially tired because it was market day, market day can't be everyday. Are the other days, say, Tesco delivers day? Or perhaps, what we've got left in the fridge/larder days? Who knows. Whatever. What matters is I had a really nice meal here. The quiche was very good, came with a nice free little salad and the drink selection was mostly organic, free trade and all that. My friend has loads of allergies and the staff made a quick sandwich up especially for her and I don't think it was just because they're mates. Nice people. Nice food. Nice time.",

Franz\u00e8 & Evans not only know what they're doing but they do it with a charm sometimes lacking in this locale.",

    "text": "Franz\u00e8 & Evans is a little cafe on Redchurch St, located just minutes away from Brick Lane, which aims to serve up quality Italian home-cooked food. Alas, on the day I went, I wasn't hungry and opted for a simple skinny cappuccino, which turned out decent. The cafe also operates as a deli, with specialty Italian foodstuffs on sale. I found the cafe a great place to chill out. It's nicely decorated, with a can of flowers on every table. The day I went, tulips were on display. It's also larger than most coffee shops in that more than five people can sit down at any one point in time. I also like that their opening hours are also pretty decent, as they open from 7 am to 7 pm every day.",

When we looked a bit shocked that the aggressive nature, he told us \" I'm trying to run a business here!\"The second time I got a takeaway lunch. I was shocked at how pricey it was for the portion I got! The only reason Im giving it two stars at all is the food was actually quite nice. All in all, overpriced,mediocre coffee and grumpy staff. For me, not worth it for a relaxing coffee/brunch. There are sooo many nicer places in Shoreditch where you will be greeted with a smile.",

In fact I think the entire staff my have been Italian or at least somewhat versant in the language.At his suggestion I took the salmon quiche and salad combo, it was perfect. The quiche was fluffy and light and salmon was fresh and not overwhelming. The salad was this amazing crispy mix of kale, sweet snap peas, green beans and sesame spices, it was super fresh and gave me that boost of green one needs after too many monochromatic meals.

The menu is pretty comprehensive, plus they have an amazing choice of salads and cakes on display.We went for a late Sunday breakfast, so I decided on the 'Trecolore' which is with poached eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, crispy prosciutto and served on sourdough bread - all covered with the most delicious Hollandaise sauce. The produce is clearly of the best quality. The freshest of eggs, cooked to perfection.The coffee is fantastic. Rich, tasty and strong (warning: very strong). Two sips and I was in need of a glass of water to stave off the jitters.Franze and Evans is not cheap - \u00a39.50 for the \"Trecolore\" (plus a side of mushrooms - which is two mushrooms for \u00a31.50). BUT I would say it is worth the additional premium, as it was excellent quality. \u00a350 for between four friends.Service pretty relaxed - you get left to it. They pack people in, but it was a Sunday at 12:30 so I'm guessing it's not always so busy. We had to share a table with others, but that's not a problem for me.Look forward to trying the salads and cakes on my next visit. They look incredible.",

Very good Italian coffee, charming rustic ambiance, and an impressive array of cakes, salads, and luncheon items. Solid Almond croissant (there are better things to get next time though), but as Larissa G. stated so accurately: It is all about the cream cheese frosting. The courgette cake with cream cheese frosting was divine. So airy and light... the texture of whipped cream, but the flavour of a buttercream. Someday. Someday.",

We both also ordered the french toast, because it just sounded SO good and we couldn't resist.The bread was hearty and thick, with plenty of delicious cinnamon and vanilla flavor. It was topped with blueberries, bananas, and of course maple syrup. We opted to add bacon, which added a really great salty element to the otherwise sweet dish.

    "text": "First of all, the atmosphere of Franze & Evans is very welcoming. There are tables lining the outside, and wooden tables crammed inside which are shared amongst parties. Though there were scattered empty seats for a lone diner such as I, I had to wait twenty minutes to be seated. I'm used to much longer waits than that, but I was peeved that I ended up being seated at a seat that was empty when I had first arrived. I was seated with a menu, but then had another fifteen minutes to wait before being acknowledged by a waiter.By the time I ordered, the couple seated ahead of me had already finished eating. Then, I was blessed with the opportunity to wait ten more minutes for water to come out - after I had to remind them.Luckily, not too long after came my open-face sandwich featuring spinach, smoked salmon, and poached eggs drizzled with hollandaise sauce all atop toasted sourdough. Needless to say, I was quite excited.I love thick cuts of sourdough. I love toasted sourdough. I do not love thick cuts of toasted sourdough which make it impossible to eat a sandwich and difficult to cut on top. The eggs were poached to perfection, and seasoned with fried prosciutto (a presentation as impressive as bacon bits - which is to say, not at all). The spinach was perfectly good spinach. The smoked salmon was perfectly good salmon. The hollandaise was very disappointing - not savory and somewhat watery (which I presume are symptoms of the same cause - not enough butter).Overall, Franze & Evans is a great spot for Instagram photos of well plated food and probably not much else.",

Lots of cakes and pastries to tempt you. There are tables outside as well as in but note one side of the outdoor seating is reserved for smokers. Nice service and an interesting crowd of people from all parts of the world. A great lunch stop on a really good shopping street.",

I had the best cappuccino of my life here and my friend enjoyed one of the green smoothies. I had a ham and cheese croissant and it was flakier and butterier than most of the croissants I've had in France. The eggs were a bright orange (because of what the hens are fed) and my friend enjoyed her eggs and toast. Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "So I had an hour in between two meetings and I was starving! Yes I could have grabbed a salt beef bagel which whenever I'm on Brick Lane is the norm BUT I wanted eggs and I'm so glad a did!I want to my trusty Yelp app and there waiting was F&E a 2 minute walk away, bingo! I walked in and grabbed a table with ease. My first thoughts were 'how cute'. It's a lovely likle cafe, perfect for meetings (which many were having), perfect for working (which many were doing) and perfect for morning breakfast dates (which I was definitely listening in on - shhh). I scanned the menu and opted for the scrambled eggs with bacon on sour dough toast. I toddled up to counter and was greeted with the very eccentric Italian (I think) owner - he did by pass me to talk to a friend of his behind me for a couple minutes which was slightly irritating but hey he's only human and I know he didn't mean offence so... He continued to circulate the room, chatting to people as they came in and the regulars. It was nice - reminded me of my local cafe at home...smiles. Now to the food - the eggs were perfect. Creamy, buttery and just scrummy. The bacon was crispy, it was streaky bacon which I wouldn't usually opt for but it went down well. And the toast was toasty :)I had a really pleasant little hour break and would definitely go back to people/owner watch and munch on some eggs.Tips: the cakes looks amazing AND there's a Yelp offer on at the minute - free coffee with a cake. Winning!",

Their hollandaise was clearly made fresh on site and a little bit goes a long, delicious way. The rest of the breakfast menu is very delicious sounding and they have a lot of veg side bits incorporated into the dishes. They also home make their beans. None of the breakfasts are too bread heavy but the bread they do get is really tasty sour dough and freshly baked.They make a good cup too. And flat whites are the normal size not that teenie, tiny child size. They have an extensive range of wines for lunch time booze hits and a big range of non alcoholic drinks for those who save their boozing til apres 5pm. On their counter, there is the most amazing looking selection of croissants with so many tempting fillings. And they have some very wholesome, tasty looking salads there on offer. The kind of salads that will actually fill you. Highly recommended.And the best thing: they open at a very sensible time of 8am mid week. Get there pre 11am. If you have to wait it is worth it.",

Upon arrival we were faced with sitting in front of the plates of the last customers. Then the waitress never arrived, so we ordered at the counter and had to wait another 20 minutes for the salads to come to our table although they were prepared and displayed ready to be served on the counter. The waitress forgot our cutlery (and our drinks) which we had to get our selves in order not to sit another 10 minutes in front of our food without being able to eat it. To top it all off the waitress was rude and acted like she was doing us a favour serving us.",

As with most places in this hipster area, the quality of the offering is very high. Portion size is very good, making it good value for money. This was my first huevos rancheros, which I've been tempted to try for a while and I wasn't disappointed. Its every bit as indulgent as it looks, with a thin crispy tortilla, beautifully fresh avocado and great big dollop of soured cream. If there was a downside to the visit, the staff could learn to smile a bit more, or at least engage with the customers. Perhaps its my Scottish cultural expectations and I hadn't fully applied by London filter, but its nice to be nice!",

Some days they gave me a full portion for the breakfast, while some other days... Mushroom cut into half... Only served me half the sausage...

They have quite a few freshly made salad presented nicely in the case, and very often they are made with healthy ingredients like kale, avocado, lentil etc. Vegetarians or vegans love this place. Beside salads, you can also get made to order dishes, like burger and pasta. For brunch, their offer all sorts of egg dishes, and I highly recommend the Franze & Evans breakfast. What I find most irresistible are those cakes, cupcakes and pies on the counter top. They looks so enticingly beautiful and they stare you right in the eye. I have to force myself not to look after every time I order my food. I did go there for tea and cake one afternoon and I had the Lemon and Yogurt cake. OMG, that was great! This is a wonderfully casual neighborhood spot for a nice and healthy lunch or full indulgence of your sweet tooth.",
