Just the roll.",

Perhaps I will have a better experience at the New York branch of Kati Roll Company.",

I'd recommend ordering 2 and keeping 1 for later if you are on your own. Size-wise, they aren' much bigger than a wrap from Pret, so you could probably knock out two for lunch without too much grumbling.It's a great quick place to pop into for lunch when wandering around Soho and it's just up the street from some markets so that makes it even better!",

The reason it is so exciting is not just because of its excentric orange paint job, but also the fact that Indian food in a roll is just delicious.As I had never heard of the place before, I asked the man in the shop a little bit about it. He told me that it started in New York and now there is a store in London. It definitely has a bit of a New York vibe about it as well.There is a selection of chicken, beef and vege rolls on offer. I went for 2 beef tikka rolls, which cost 6 pounds. It was definitely a good choice, and I am keen to go through the whole menu, as I get the feeling they would all be good.",

The kati rolls consist of your choice of filling wrapped inside a 'paratha', which is a North Indian variety of bread. My usual is either the chicken tikka roll or the paneer roll. If you get 2 you get a better deal and honestly, the rolls are medium sized so one wouldn't be sufficient for most people. Just one bit of warning: the chutney/chilli mixture they use is hot. The first time I went there I made the mistake of ordering it 'hot' and after half a litre of water and some sugar, my mouth felt it may live. If you're unsure as to how hot you want the rolls to be you can always ask for the chutney on the side and it's pretty hot too. I usually ask my rolls to be 'medium' hot and still sniffle a bit at the end of the meal. Perfect take out for days with too much school work to be bothered to cook something or after an exhausting evening of shopping at oxford !Actually perfect food for any day any time! :)",

In a city of options, one must have a tool to find the best (within the budget). So when I hit that first craving for Indian food, and happened to be in the hopping area around Oxford Circus, I decided to brave a trip to Kati Roll. Little did I know that no courage was required--the place is fantastic.The first indication of a good ethnic restaurant is the customers, and I am pleased to say that it seems a wide variety of people love Kati Roll. The tables were completely full when I walked in, with suits and locals happily munching on this new \"kati roll\" concept. I was able to order with my non-chip debit card, making me a happy customer, and waited patiently in the take away queue. When my food arrived, it was hot, zippy, and fresh. It made me hate to think of taking it away, and I wanted to sit down right there and eat. The idea of putting Indian food into a tortilla is brilliant, combining two of my favorite cuisines. It allows you to move in day-to-day activities while having a hand free and a hand eating. Multitasking, people! For the price, it is also very reasonable... I ordered two chicken tikka rolls, and couldn't finish.Definitely worth the little side-street you wander to find it, I look forward to introducing new London friends to Kati Roll!",

I went for the boring white-man option and got Chicken Tikka. And boy-oh-boy was it good. Crunchy onion pickle, the ghee-a licious soft wheat paratha (though you can get a roti, which is baked, if you prefer), tangy Chicken... just the right amount of grease to make it tasty but not greasy or heavy.

Located in a side street very close to Oxford Circus, I decided to come to this place. I was not too familiar with Kati Rolls before coming so I asked the people who work there what is their most popular Kati Roll. They said to me the Unda Chicken Roll is their most popular one. I decided to get one, even though it was about \u00a3.75 more than the Chicken Tikka Roll on the menu.After waiting a few minutes, my Kati Roll came in. I sat down and began to eat it, and I thought it was one of the tastiest Indian dishes I had. Despite the greasiness, I loved the texture of the flat-bread. It was so warm, soft and chewy. As for the inside, the chicken was really tasty. Tender and meaty, with a nice flavourful spice. The vegetables inside were pretty good as well. I think one roll might be decent for a light lunch, but two of them can definitely get your stomach full. I found out that this place has another location in New York City, so I'll keep that in mind the next time I visit. Overall, this is a pretty tasty place to get some Indian take away, and I would definitely come back here again if I do not want to spend too much money while visiting Oxford Circus.",

The enthusiastic walls are done in orange with old and some loud Bollywood movie posters and they serve the BEST keema (lamb) and achari paneer (Indian cheese) wrap in London. The atmosphere perfectly translates to what I'd call 'haven' after you're down a few drinks in the pubs around the area and you do not have to be cautious while ordering here, as the wraps are a-m-a-zing and the pricing is sweet!",

After spending ages looking at the delicious menu online we settled on a few different ones so we could compare notes. When I got there I still had to queue to pay but got my order pretty quickly. Back in the office I was welcomed by a bunch of salivating guys, mmmm! \u00a0First of all the rolls are not that big and one wouldn't be enough to fill you for lunch, luckily we all had one and a half as we wanted to try different ones. They got the order wrong and put a couple of them in paratha rather than Roti roll but we decided to just keep them as I didnt really fancy another walk through soho at lunchtime. Spices and flavours were quite nice but all of us agreed that the meat was far too dry and quite frankly a bit of a disappointment.Maybe they just had a bad day so Im determined to give them another go at some point!",

Nothing special, almost like a standard kebab shop. The menu is small but perfectly formed, and is fairly reasonable (though you could probably get a sandwich cheaper elsewhere). Yet this is hot, fresh and a little different, so worth a little bit more.I had a chicken tikka roll, and it was bliss. A fried Indian flatbread housed fresh spicy chicken with onions and lots of lovely spices. I throughly enjoyed it, despite the wait, It's obviously popular so there was a fair queue to be served - despite ordering near immediately.Bit chilly in there though, most definitely one for a take-out. And the rolls are an odd size for me. One wasn't quite enough, two probably would have been too much.I'm still a fan though, and like FJ, get a pang of craving every time I walk past!",

They are on the small side, but two left me slightly comatose.I tried the chicken and the lamb... both were tasty (and since I asked for it) pretty dang spicy. \u00a0My big complaint is that they were both really dry. \u00a0Some curry cream or sauce or yogourt or something would have helped the slightly parched feeling the wraps had (although the meat was very tender and flavorful.) \u00a0There is the option of adding egg, which she described as omelet, but that's not really what I mean... \u00a0I guess I'm looking for the cheese or refried beans equivalent in a burrito, the gluey mess that brings it all together and smooshes all over your mouth.So between the dryness and the very boring, garish, fast food-ey decor of the interior, it lost a few marks. \u00a0But these rolls are still worth a sample (individual rolls are nice and cheap) and are a great quick bite as you explore, so do give 'em a shot.",

It's a very humble interior, as they want you to feel like you're on the street in India, and they keep the menu pretty simple as well. We split a chicken tikka wrap, and it was enough to hold us over, but most people looked like they ordered 2 per person. It was mid afternoon, but still packed, so we enjoyed some Indian beer (brewed in the UK) and enjoyed the break from the crowd. 2 beers and a juicy wrap with tons of flavor was 11 pounds, and totally worth the money!!",

Really tasty, moreish wraps - the chicken tikka roll is my favourite thus far, plus the coriander \"chutney\" goes really well! Though asking an extra 20p or so for the little tub is a bit silly - I don't see why it's not included, they have vats of the stuff! Doesn't everyone want delicious coriander dip? Just me then, I guess...I did find that one roll is not quite enough, but thankfully they price 2 (of the same) at a discounted rate, so whilst you'll be paying \u00a37, you'll be full and very, very satisfied. Well marinaded meat, perfectly cooked - juicy with that grilled charring to add flavour - plus the usual spices and onions, all served in a tasty roti wrap.Be prepared at busy times to wait 10 minutes for you order, but then you can enjoy the old Indian movie posters and other decor with your food, or just order to go. Worth a pop in now and then - I save it for special occasions when I'm really craving Indian food during a work lunch. Definitely better than, and vastly different from, the usual surrounding cafes and delis in the area. Go for it! You'll enjoy it!",

The menu has a nice variety of kathi roll selections. This was my first time trying kathi roll & it was delicious. Spiced vegetables &/or meat wrapped in a roti (delicious thin flatbread). The number of rolls to order depends on the size of your stomach & how hungry you are. 1 roll was a good sized snack, 2 rolls is a big meal. I had the shrimp masala & chicken masala, both were tasty. The shrimp masala was about half the size of the chicken masala, less filling, but the flavor of the shrimp masala was tastier. The service here was quite slow - there was confusion at the counter that left me waiting a long time for my takeaway order. Still worth trying!",

You know what I mean when you inhale and can taste the spices on your palate.And then I saw the price and thought: What, \u00a34.45 for a small paneer wrap? Are you nuts? Looked like I could eat it in 2 bites. \u00a0 Again I was mistaken ...if you get the wrap using paratha it is quite thick and after I was done (with only the one roll), I was pretty full! This simple paneer chili roll was amazing -- delivering complex tastes of coriander, lime, garam masala, and chili I hadn't tasted since my last trip to India. Although I was full, I was annoyed at myself for not getting the 2 rolls for \u00a37.50.Yup, no wonder the queues are long at lunchtime.",

    "text": "I didn't understand the excitement when my boyfriend told me I had to try this little fast food Indian roll place that had orange walls. He was as vague as that and had forgotten the name, the exact location so the image I created in my head did not do the place any justice and was off putting, The term fast food isn't the best label to put on this place but that is exactly what it is - fast Indian snack house but with quality. The place is amazing. And yes it is very orange, you pay at the counter like you would at any fast food place, collect your food and sit down to enjoy but the food you're getting is quality street food. My hopes for the place was a little better when I realised it was located in the behind Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus on Poland Street- the place where all the best restaurants reside in Soho and it fits in!I loved the ragged decor of old Bollywood posters plastered onto the walls half torn along with the tattered looking wooden tables and chairs. Even the air con had a quick brush of grey paint to add that to that rustic effect. It was our afternoon snack and at that time the place did seem very clean and well maintained. Staff seem friendly enough and were having their own little jokes in the kitchen which was nice to have. Music was well chosen to suit the atmosphere, not too loud and calm for one to hear each other's conversation and the place was filled with groups of friends who looked like they were after a little snack break after a long shopping trip in Oxford Street.I would advise everyone here to order the Paratha roll. It is the standard one so even if you don't specify it is the one you will get unless you request for a roti roll instead. And it is these amazing wraps that makes all the difference to these rolls. These fried seasoned flatbreads in ghee, buttery, flakey yet slightly chewy texture made it really good to bite into. They were also slightly charry which gave it that slight smokey flavour. I could have easily eaten these alone with soup but they really did play a huge part in making these rolls so deliciously satisfying. Where my boyfrend went for the Prawn Masala Roll I went for the Shami Kebab roll. I did take a bite of the Prawn Masala and found the prawns packed with flavour and very well spiced with a good kick of heat. It was very light and hollow, probably not best if you wanted something to fill you up but the flavours were immense. But it did not compare to my Shami Kebab roll which was bursting with mild spices and flavours. The croquettes had a beautifully coarse texture of the minced lambs and lentils, juicy and slightly crispy with extra flavours coming through the lovely smokey onions. I would not have changed anything about them other than the fact I wish I ordered two rather than one. For \u00a35 they aren't cheap as a snack but people pay nearly that much for a coffee these days. But the option to order them in twos at a discounted price is cool for those who want to be filled up.I would also recommend the Mango Lassi if one is willing to pay \u00a33 to one. It was the cherry on top of my meal- sweet, thick and creamy and everything I expect from a Mango Lassi and in a nice presentable glass bottle. I would highly recommend Kati Roll if you're around the West End and feeling peckish or for light eaters. You can order more and have a Kati feast and of course takeaway if you don't want to appear greedy. Trust me, they are worth every calorie.",

Both the paratha and roti taste nice. I prefer the roti though. I do feel the wraps are quite greasy sometimes. They also serve chai and lassi. Nice place to have a quick bite before or after shopping.",

If (when) I go back I want to try the paneer option because although the chicken/egg combo is obviously to be supported (2+ proteins always a good thing) I suspect the vegetarian option will be more up my street. And there's loads more options besides, bigger choice than say Mooli's (not hating on Mooli's in any way of course). To sit in it's not particularly pleasant, they could do with some better lighting and more stable stools...overall though it's excellent value for money and good fresh food.",

The interiors are filled with painted Indian Movie posters from the 80s and 90s. They also play good music. They serve Indian Chai and Lassi also. One bit of disappointment was that chutneys which are generally given as sides with rolls in many other places, are charged over here. Though it costs only a few pennies, I felt it was an overkill.Rolls cost a minimum of 3GBP and if bought a pair they give it for slightly less. Like what would cost you 8 pounds, might be paired for 6. If I were a student in London, I would be a regular here.",

Wrapping food in bread is pretty much a universally good idea, and the roti roll is not at risk of providing a counterexample.Kati Roll Company have a pretty limited selection of fillings but they combine them imaginatively, resulting in a decently full menu. Prices are reasonable.I do like this place. My usual order is a beef roll and an egg roll - decent combo if a little heavy on the onions sometimes. My main criticism is the speed of service - fair enough a lot of the food is made to order, but it's still pretty darned slow for a place that is decorated far too sparsely to make you want to hang around. Speaking of which, while I love the bollywood look the place is going for, it really could do with a sprucing up. Nothing says 'budget constraints' more than sagging picture frames!",

I have bought my mother and grandmother here for lunch when we were out on our annual shopping trip. They were both so impressed with the food, the choices available and the price. Kati Roll has a very indian vibe which my grandmother said reminded her of some restaurant she went to years ago with my grandfather, so there is clearly some Indian origin or its just decorated extremely well. My mother who is so particular about eating indian food out loved these and commented on how authentic they tasted, which was surprising to me. We tried the various vegetarian rolls they had to offer and they were so well made that we finished what we ordered initially and as we were still hungry, ended up ordering more to eat in and then ordered some for take away for my father. If I am in the area, I will definitely come back and since I've bought my mother and grandmother, I will probably do a take away for them too. If your in the area and want a quick snack then come here. It is amazing!!!",

Its on Poland street and has a fair bit of seating room and a toilet downstairs as well - This is very important information if you have just finished a grueling multi-hour multi-point shopping spree. I found this place thanks to a random nice guy who replied to my tweet imploring the wise crowds to suggest a place to quench my thirst and hunger. The tweet travelled across the Atlantic and reached me just in time for lunch and the restaurant was conveniently found a few blocks from work! It isn't much to look at on the outside. A small shop near a big-ass pub (which by the way is full of people on Friday nights). The menu is short and is made up a few rolls with different stuff inside it - don't forget to ask for the little box of mint sauce they give away. The chai is good as well. The deco is 60-80's Indian movie posters and the style of posters that we still see in Rural India in some places where they couldn't bothered to 'print' stuff out - its all painted. The Matrix poster (called 'Mayajaal' in Hindi) is particularly funny.",

It's a narrow place but there was a queue already at midday (strange I thought as it was early for lunch). but a good sign.I wanted something cheap and cheerful so I could take out and wander the streets of Soho. I knew they had a variety (a very good choice) of Paratha wraps. Being Asian I've had a lot of Paratha's in my time. I really wanted to taste it without meat so I opted for the sweet potato. I actually got 2 (they have a deal on always where you can have 2 of same for slightly cheaper price).I had to wait about 20 mins. But to me this is a good sign as it was really being made fresh. I sat down and waited. The Sweet potato was worth the wait. In fact one roll was enough. It was stuffed with potato! The Paratha was very well made. I will definitely come back to have a lamb or chicken one. Maybe just one on it's own actually. At about \u00a33.50 it was a good lunch meal in a bustling Soho scene.",

It's kind of like a more fun than Subway, kind of place, considering essentially the rolls are a variation on sammiches, but in no way are these rolls sub-par, they're rather su-perb actually. This carby pit-stop is a really cheery place with jolly Bolly bangers on the playlist and the rolls are satisfying enough to see even the most peckish potential party-goer or go-home-r through the evening. The prawn wraps are my fave and the paratha roll itself is rich, fluffy and doughy with just enough ghee to get it down yer, with the cool lubricant of a chilled fizzy Cobra; Natch.One is enough for me for an early teatime fill but for a hungrier person, definitely go for the twofer offers. I'd really love it if you did, I'd ask you to get the paneer chilli roll so I could have just a little bit of a bite.",

I'd recommend two wraps per person; one would be a snack. Now onto filings: we went for the paneer roll, the shami kebab roll (minced lamb and lentils), the unda chicken roll (chicken tikka with egg), and the shrimp masala roll, all in parathas. All excellent; the shrimp masala being my favourite with the huge tiger prawns and mix of spices. The paneer roll was much blander compared to the others because the paneer was in such large chunks. Overall, not spicy (win for me!), but a very good mix of spices to give depth to the flavours. This place has maybe 10 tables, and is more of a cafe/fast food joint than a restaurant; the food is served on paper plates, and you should make sure to clean up after yourself. It gets pretty busy but it is very much worth waiting for.",

Alternatively no shame in just ordering yourself a big feast for one :DThe rolls are made of soft layered paratha bread (which I used to just scoff plain as a child mmm), stuffed with a filling of your choice and yummy veggies on top. For me the best one is the achaari paneer roll, probably because I've grown up loving the taste of achaar pickle having watched my grandma making it at home out of mango, lemon, chilli and spices. It's the perfect flavouring to team with the paneer (cheese). Last time I went with a fellow omnivore and had a Chicken Tikka roll each too, which was also nicely spicy and full of flavour.The crowd always seems to have an Asian majority, which makes me think I'm not the only one enjoying the flavours of 'home' in this setting. It usually takes a good 10 mins so not the fastest of fast food but oh so worth the little wait. If you have time to eat in, take a seat beneath an old bollywood poster and enjoy with a cup of masala chai.You might be able to manage two rolls; I usually manage one-and-a-half and save the rest for later - they have some useful foil-lined takeaway packets that stop the smell infiltrating your whole bag (shame they couldn't help with the smell on my tingling lips and fingers afterwards though - I rocked up at the cinema massively paranoid at being the walking cliche of an indian girl who smells like a curryhouse...!).Ok, my mouth is now watering which makes me think I must be due another hit of this deliciousness ASAP!",

I ordered the shami kebab (lamb) roll and unda chicken roll with a mango lassi.The drink was refreshing and the mango flavor was very sweet. But the texture was a little too thick for my liking (It reminded me of Danimals yogurt cups.) The chicken roll with beaten eggs was delicious and my favorite. The lamb roll was interesting, the herbs and spices were very unique. The rolls are extremely oily and wrapped in thin paper, which makes the oil pool at the bottom of the roll. The entire meal came out to \u00a312! For two rolls and a lassi, definitely a reasonable price for a decent amount of food!",

Try the unda chicken, the beef, and the shammi kebab. Among the vegetarian options the achari paneer is good too.

    "text": "After reading and hearing about this place I was really excited to go and visit but I have to say when I went for the first time with my friend that recommended it I wasn't blown away. The decor is really cool and very on 'theme' and there's sufficient seating. We ordered 2 rolls each and a tea to have in. The food came really quickly but we had to wait 25 minutes for the tea to arrive after my friend chased them a few times. I found the rolls quite soggy and they didn't look like they had been cooked very well but somehow the flavours were still good. It was a cheap and cheerful place and I love Indian food A LOT so it was ok but definitely not a WOW for me. However, a few weeks later I was at the pub next door with my partner and it was fairly late and he really wanted some food but not in a sit down formal setting, just something quick and easy to grab. As it was next door and open until fairly late I recommended Kati Roll and we popped in to give it another go. We ordered 2 rolls each and a beer to have in quickly. I LOVED IT! PHEW! I had an egg and potato paratha roll and a prawn paratha roll both cooked beautifully and farily crispy on the outside, just the way I like it. My partner ordered the chicken tikka roll as a roti and the mince and potato one which is his favourite now. We also ordered the green chutney pots to go with it which are a perfect accompaniment and at 25p a pot an absolutely steal. My partner finished his in about 5 minutes with a big smile on his face and as we were leaving he went up to the counter to order 4 more to take away with him! We were both impressed and ever since then I've probably come back 10 times or so and every time has been exceptional. I'm so pleased I came back to give this place another go. Every time my partner knows I'm knocking about Soho I always get a text saying 'if you go past Kati Roll can you pick me up a couple please!'. Definitely a winner in our household.",

I am glad to find out that this place was fantastic and my fellow Yelpers back it with 4 stars rating and close to a 100 reviews. \u00a0 After walking for a bit on Oxford I couldn't decide which street to turn to look for a lunch spot, but being Polish, I knew there must be something good on Poland street! \u00a0 The place is small and very busy so grab an empty table while you're in line if one becomes available. The staff was very friendly and welcoming asking if that was my first time and saying that after today I will be coming there more. I decided to mix the two rolls (getting 2 is good amount for lunch). I got one chicken tikka and one with potato filling. Once ready your number is called out and you pick your order at the counter. I love roti, so wrapping delicious Indian fillings inside them is a great idea. I only wish I got some chutney to go with it. The roti is moist and the filling is quite moist, but still you need some chutney, or that Indian yogurt drink (they sell it there) to wash it down. Still- very delicious lunch. I will be coming here more indeed, if I am back near that area!",

However, when we turned up late in the evening we found that there were a few patrons, plenty of seats, and one person working at the till.I ordered two mint lamb wraps, they were quite tiny for the price. The wraps were reheated. Granted the fillings were great it was filled to the brim but the sort of non-fresh reheated wrap was ruining the taste. It was also very tiny so one wrap would not have fed anyone sufficiently for lunch or dinner!My companion's wrap was not hot enough and she took it back for a further reheat...mmm maybe just bad luck? I'm not sure I want to come back during lunch with the supposedly massive queues just to see whether it's really as good as other people have been saying it was!The posters on the wall were hilarious though. A bollywood version of the Matrix? Awesome!",

The basis on this place is simple. They offer two types of wraps, Paratha, which is their original grilled bread, or Roti, which is whole wheat roasted bread. Once you choose your bread, you have a choice of Indian fillings.I tend to go for the roti and on this visit chose the Chicken Tikka filling and it only came to \u00a33.75. A bargain!! If their are two of you are your'e extra hungry you can get 2 for \u00a37.00. An even bigger bargain! Think of any sort of popular curry dish, and you can you usually get it here in a wrap.The store itself is long and narrow with the serving area at the far end. It is always packed when I go, and tends to have lots of Indian customers, which to me is a good sign. Although their is seating here, I tend to get my roti, and take it with me.They also have a Swipii loyalty system. This means you can either get a free soft drink after three visits, or a free wrap after five visits.The Kati Roll Company is well situated near Oxford Circus, just off Oxford Street. If you're in the area and feeling a bit peckish, it's an ideal place to pop into and satisfy your appetite. I highly recommmend this place for a good and different take out option.",

    "text": "A 'Kati Roll' is a type of Indian street food popular in Kolkata (Calcutta), India. Kati Roll has just three branches, two in New York (where Time Out New York lauded it in 2002 and 2005), and one in London on the fringes of Soho. The rolls available include, spicy potatoes, paneer, chicken tikka, beef or mutton. These are finished off with spices, red onion and lime slivers. The 'Kati Roll' is said to have been inadvertently created by by Nizam's, a restaurant in the city noted for its Mughlai food. Seemingly, the number of people asking for kebab and parathas one day far outstripped the number of plates available. It was decided to wrap the kebab in parathas, and in the process, this reduced the number of plates required. Hey presto! The Kati roll was born. Suffice it to say that at around \u00a36 on average for two rolls, it represents good value for a filling lunchtime supersnack. I especially recommend the potato filling and the paneer (cheese) filling. I am told that the shami kabab is also quite something. I'll let you know when I try it next time!",

Its the most popular street food there ... and one of the very few things about home that i really miss.I had seen Kati roll stores in New York and have been to there outlets in West Village and midtown. They were always crowded. So when they opened the store in London last year i was really excited (went there for dinner the very day i found out about its existence).They make the rolls really well ... my favourites are the egg chicken roll and the shami kabba roll. The service is very nice. They used to deliver the rolls to my office at St Paul's for lunch (well ... we almost always ordered more than 10 at a time). The veg options are also pretty good. They are a bit pricey here though, compared to their flagship stalls at NY. Something that costs $5.25 there costs \u00a34 here. Since its located at a convenient location near Soho, i occasionally go there late at night on weekends (open till 12:30 on friday and saturday). But unfortunately i almost always find its empty. Its sad to see that London doesn't enjoy these great rolls :( ...",

Not 100% authentic Indian touch to the food though, so I think 3 stars is a fair judgement.",

I got the chicken tikka roll, and it was really good. The pita/crepe outside was crispy without being burnt, which was a pleasant surprise, but the chicken inside was a little too dry. It was seasoned well, though, so I'm willing to write that off as a bad job. One roll definitely wasn't enough (I ended up going to the McDonald's down the street to finish my meal), but I guess that's why it's cheaper to get two.",
