The prices are quite expensive for what it is but with the amazing view this can be expected. Cocktails were ok but some were a bit sickly. Only thing which was a bit off putting was the loud background music which sounded like something you'd hear in a lift but much more frantic. Very distracting. The food is good and the setting is very special so still a good option for a treat.",

    "text": "Anytime you visit a restaurant it's about experience and being that Darwin is atop SkyGarden can make even a so-so meal acceptable. The setting is lovely and very in step with the latest trend of using natural woods and muted colours throughout. Our server was great and provided prompt courteous service. The part that was so-so was what I ordered, the Pulled Pork Burger. First off I am as my header indicates an American Southerner in London. When you're offering a pulled pork anything it'd better be damn good. Sadly, it was very disappointing to the level that I didn't even finish it. It's very hard to describe but it's a compressed ball, slightly pressed down to fit in-between a bun and served with triple cooked chips. Again, these were also a bit of a disappointment as they didn't have that same quality of triple cooked chips I've had in other places in London. Some pubs around town offer the best I've enjoyed so far. It wasn't just me as I shared my chips with others at the table and we agreed they were 'meh-ok' which add to the A-OK rating. My colleagues enjoyed their meals very much and that inspires me to return and try something else on the menu. It seems they adjust it with the seasons as well which is exciting too. So there ya have it folks, Darwin is probably more than A-Ok but that was my experience this time around. Go and try Darwin Brasserie for yourself, take in the lovely setting and remember that this pulled pork loving American Southerner in London says pull yourself away from that burger to avoid disappointment, y'all.",

Luckily the full English breakfast was tasty and we were having it with champagne..eating & drinking like queens! \u00a0The service was attentive, though they spilt a drink over one of the group's coat but they were so apologetic and insisted on picking up the dry cleaning bill.Definitely will come back with the fam.",

The sky garden has 360 views of the city and you can see for absolute miles in any direction! We opted for the ultimate breakfast consisting of a continental buffet which was regularly filled with fresh hot bakery items, as well as fruits and yoghurts, a selection of spreads and tea & coffee! All the hot breakfasts were presented beautifully and we're just delicious! Staff were very helpful but didn't hover around you asking you if you were okay every 5 minutes! It was relaxed and we didn't feel rushed as you would normally in this sort of venue as booking allocations are restricted to two hours!! This is something I would definitely recommend to anyone living in London and a great place to fake friends and family who may be visiting! It is extremely affordable as well as there are different breakfast \"options\" you can choose from! A great place all in all!",

Because it's located at the top of the garden, you kind of feel like you're immersed in the jungle as you're at level with the trees which is cool! I was feeling terrible that day however I still enjoyed the meal! I had smoked salmon to start and the chicken with peas and potatoes for mains. I thought that it was quite nice although I'm not a big pea fan! I liked the ambience of the restaurant and the waiting staff were lovely! As it was mine and my boyfriend's 6 month anniversary, the waiting staff brought in a little dessert for us at the end of our meal which was nice of them! Overall, a very pleasant experience. You can still get the good views of London, even though you aren't right by the window but also you feel like you're up in the trees which I liked.",

A buffet starter and dessert and your own choice of main course. Food was excellent quality, starter was however meaty - not much choice for veggies. Mains were delish however portions of some mains such as pancakes were a bit sparse for the price. Would recommend it as the food was v good and the view is excellent. Just go there hungry and ready to eat! The desserts were my favourite. Choc almond tart is a must try!",

    "text": "London seems to have been swept by a succession of restaurants with a view recently - Duck & Waffle, Aqua, Hutong and City Social to name a few. Taking prime place at the top of London's favourite skyscrapers, these restaurants offer diners the chance to take in the beauty of the city, whilst tasting some of the best culinary experiences the capital has to offer. The new-boy to the party, opened in January 2015, is Sky Garden located at 20 Fenchurch Street or the walkie-talkie building as it's more affectionately named. If you still don't know the building - it's the one that melted in the cars in the summer.... - yep that's the one.The building is home to three dining establishments, Fenchurch Seafood Bar & Grill, Darwin Brasserie and Sky Pod plus is also the home to the highest rooftop gardens in London, hence the name gettit.To start, I chose the Sticky Shallot Tarte Tatin with goats cheese, which was really rather excellent. The base could have been a little crispier for me but the caramelised shallots and anything with goats cheese is always a winner in my book. Tom went for the beetroot cured salmon with horseradish creme fraiche and suffered a bit of food envy at the sight of my dish. The texture was a bit 'mushy' for lack of better word and the flavour of the salmon was overpowered slightly.On to main courses, we were both equally pleased with our choices. I had pork belly which was served with puy lentils, carrots, crackling and apple sauce whist he went for the braised ox cheek.Mine was wonderfully cooked (although I would have preferred a few more carrots - they seemed a bit lost) and the crackling had the perfect amount of crunch. The ox cheek too was excellent, really meaty and tender and the sauce made with shallots and pancetta was incredibly 'more-ish' - my turn for food envy.For sides we went with tenderstem brocolli and spinach which we can't really fault. I loved the spinach - it was jewelled with rock salt and i would have wolfed the whole plate down in one if i hadn't been sharing....Word of warning - the bar area is freezing. Even the poor waitress who greats you at the elevator was wearing a fluffy hat. Either wait till Spring/Summer or grab your coat, but it's definitely worth the trip up, even if just for that Sticky Shallot Tart....",

My expectations were very low...most restaurants with views like this one (absolutely amazing) can get away with subpar food...and I have found that most do just that. So I decided to focus on the atmosphere and view...I was lucky to go for lunch on a Monday when there were no crowds at all, very quiet, though the restaurant got a little busy. To my surprise, the food was superb. I got the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and the sea trout entree and couldn't have been happier. Both were delicious and I ate them will gazing out over the London Bridge and Thames. As a bonus, the Darwin Punch was amazing. I HIGHLY recommend it. I am a foodie with high standards and it was fantastic. Also great service. The appetizer took awhile to come out, but REALLY??? Who can complain about that when the food and service are great and the gardens and view are amazing. In my opinion, if you give a bad review because of that it is because you are simply looking for something to complain about. Don't think twice...just make reservations. Try a weekday lunch...I could see that a big crowd would make the entire experience a little amazing.",

The ox cheek was beautifully cooked to a wonderful soft texture. The whole plaice served with shrimps and spinach was all the way through to the bone leaving no trace of blood water that I have at some places, which can be off putting! But this was cooked nicely!What I like about Darwin is that the dishes are simple. You will even find one of British iconic dish, Fish and Chips on the menu. The presentation was simple but thoughtful - the half lemon was wrapped in a mesh net so when you squeeze the fruit, only the juice comes out.The resturant has a nice casual atmosphere with a view of London. Decent portion and resonable price gets my like and my recent recommendation!",

When me and my partner arrived, we were seated at the bar until our table was ready. One of the barmen, looking very presentable in a suit, asked us what we would like to drink. He was friendly and asked what our favourite kind of alcohol was in order to make us a cocktail, it was a great personal touch. My cocktail was amazing! We were shown to our table shortly afterwards which had a nice view out of the window. The waiters started off quite tentative and took our order. Starters arrived quickly and I have to say it was delicious, I couldn't fault it at all. Given how great the starter was, our main courses were highly anticipated and so we waited... And waited... And waited. After 50 minutes a waitress acknowledged that we had been waiting for our main courses for a long time and went to see what the delay was. Well she went and we saw her come back but she didn't come back to us to explain where our main courses had got to. After an hour we got our main courses which turned out to be quite disappointing and wasn't the taste sensation that I was hoping for.I had also ordered a glass of wine in the meantime which took 15 minutes to arrive at our table. Due to the time, as it was quite late and we still had to travel some distance home, we decided to skip dessert. To our surprise the waiter had deducted our main courses from the bill which was much appreciated. I hope that if I came here again, the service would be to a higher standard.",

    "text": "cssk. Sunday brunch at the walkie talkie building, over. cssk.Spectacular views over London are provided along with a substantial cold buffet.And I'd be very happy to leave it right there.Unfortunately, included in the price is also a main course after the buffet which is completely unnecessary. Because it's \u00a338 per person you feel obliged. Consequently you end up going down the lift 5kg heavier than you went in which is a worry for the creaking steel cables.Also included in the price is a far too jaunty 'personal waiter' who can't wait to tell you how the whole thing works (always a nightmare. \"have you been to a Harvester before?\"), what his name is and how happy he is to be serving you. All very nice if you're American and demand large helpings of mock sincerity with your service - I suspect most of the people there fell into this category - but less appreciated if you're a cynical grumpy Londoner who just wants you to give him his plate and get lost.The buffet itself was decent standard. Good tasting and textured cured meats nicely presented rather than just wanged onto the tray in a desperate attempt to keep up with the hungry hoards. Salads that don't scrimp on the good stuff like asparagus and artichoke, and don't try and hoodwink with lashings of cheap mayo. Good quality stuff and lots of choice. Tasty breads to go with it and tempting puddings to look forward to after chomping your way through the totally unnecessary main.I had a pan fried bream as my main in a vain bid to seem healthy. It was nicely done. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The roast lunch was also good. I know this because I polished off half the boy's and the missus's as they were completely unable to get through it after the excesses of the buffet.We hung around to watch London light up at dusk which was delightful even if you've lived here all your life. And to be fair, jaunty staff were happy for the boy to tip up to the buffet twice more for a double dip into the puddings. The whole thing was on my aunt and the day felt rather special because of that and the setting. If they could squeeze out the touristy trappings of the restaurant I'd be more than happy to go back again. It feels glam and it's nice to visit the City on a Sunday. And even if it stays unashamedly touristy, I'd say it's worth a trip to tick it off the list.",

I was able to make reservations a day in advance (to be seated @ 1330) and found it to be the easiest of the three restaurants to book. \u00a0Fenchurch is like 3 weeks in advance. We arrived a bit early and I'm glad we did. You have to go through metal detectors (like airport security) before you even get to the 36th floor. Our table was not quite ready so we ordered some cocktails at the bar. I highly recommend a cocktail here; they know what they are doing. Keeping our lunches light during our trip to central London, we only ordered two appetizers and one side. All three were above average in taste and quality of ingredients but pricey for the portions you get. Service was outstanding and my request to sit by a window was granted. This place is necessary when visiting London for the first time, the views are breathtaking and since London is so expensive, I suggest dining here for breakfast or lunch.",

We ordered drinks and deserts. Both were amazing. Each a little different with their own twist. The view is not as impressive as the other parts of the sky garden as it is up in the rafters. You do get a breathtaking sunlight as the sun set. We'll worth just for the food and drinks though",

    "text": "My little sister and my flatmate's birthdays are on the same date, so to celebrate their milestone (they turned 30 this year!) I decided to treat them to a special girls dinner in the Sky Garden.The Sky Garden is at the top of the 'walkie talkie' building (aka 20 Fenchurch) in the City of London, and so has great views on all sides.We started with drinks in Sky Bar - the 2 storey space with all those views and a bar in the middle.The drinks menu was very interesting and the cocktails for both the bar and the 2 restaurants had been highly recommended.We tried the Papi Chulo (Zacapa rum and chilli), Members Club (Bulleit Bourbon), Winter Garden (Tanqueray gin and kaffir lime) and Fire Place (Zubrowka and apple). The Members Club cocktail had a hidden chocolate coin at the bottom of its spherical ice block and we all enjoyed the 'interesting' twists to the cocktails!After drinks we explored some more of the garden area before heading to dinner. There are 2 restaurants to choose from in the Sky Garden - Fenchuch and Darwin. As it was a last minute booking we had to go for dinner at Darwin brasserie, which is the cheaper/less posh of the two, but was still great! As we entered we were hit by the noise - there was very buzzy atmosphere and the restaurant was full on a Wednesday night, with a mixture of groups and couples. Top tip - tables for couples are around the outside of the room nearest to the windows - perfect for date night!The Darwin menu is concise but full of tempting goodies! We started with the kale and pumpkin salad - full of interesting flavours and textures; the Dorset crab; the smoked salmon and beetroot - a classic combination; and the peppered beef carpaccio - with goat cheese and rocket. We all enjoyed every bite of the starters and obviously had to share them out so everyone could enjoy (and Instagram!)For the main course we weren't as adventurous. Birthday girl #1 went for the braised lamb shank and the rest of us plumped for the confit duck. The duck was a very full meal, as it came with beans, a great gravy and sausage!You might have thought that we would be full by then - but hey it was a special occasion so of course we made room for dessert! We tried the honeycomb cheesecake, the mint chocolate marquise with mint choc chip icecream and the pineapple carpaccio - the dehydrated pineapple slices were a revelation!We finished the meal with a celebratory glass of champagne and rolled downstairs to our Uber!I'd definitely recommend the Sky Garden and Darwin for special occasions like this - the other restaurant, Fenchurch even does a tasting menu with wine pairing if you need to up the wow factor!You can of course visit the Sky Garden without booking into the restaurants - however pre booked tickets are useful. If you book to eat and want to go around the garden and enjoy the views, then make sure you leave time.They say to allow 15 minutes for airport style security checks at the entrance and then another 15 minutes before your restaurant booking. If you are having a drink at the Sky bar you might want longer - but note that the tables by the window tend to be reserved, so booking for the bar is advised for large groups or if you want those window tables",

    "text": "My final meal before having to leave London. Treated my friend who let me stay at her place to Sunday brunch. This was my only chance to get into Sky Garden. I had only found out about Sky Garden the night before, so of course the free tickets were impossible, especially given that this particular week's weather was amazing.So I booked a 2pm brunch despite having to catch a flight departing from Heathrow at 6pm. Service was great. They let us take a seat 15 minutes early. They were attentive the entire time, although I've been to places that clear your plate as soon as you stand up. The buffet was amazing. Two types of smoked fish, mackerel, cured pork and beef, cheeses, broccolini, potato salad, other salads, quinoa. Smoothies, including a blueberry and kale smoothie. Bloody Mary bar, featuring standard, beef and Virgin Marys. Your choice of garnishes, in addition to additional hot sauce and horseradish. They didn't have Chinese chili nor oyster Marys as promised though. For the mains, I selected roast sirloin with Yorkshire pudding. The sirloin with gravy was definitely taken from a good piece of beef. However, I opted for rare, so cutting my sirloin was a bit difficult with the provided knife. The potato, broccoli and mashed carrots were spot on, but the Yorkshire pudding tasted and looked overcooked. My friend's fish and chips looked like the same batter as the Yorkshire pudding, so that was unfortunate. However, the dessert buffet made up for it. The donuts looked amazing and the banoffee pie in a mason jar was well balanced and delicious. There were also oatmeal cookie bars, brownies and panna cotta. Unfortunately, I was so full (as expected) so I couldn't enjoy all the desserts in their entirety, but the samples I had were exceptional. Despite the mains being lackluster, the overall experience and the rest of the food were top notch. And during brunch, it seems to be a better choice over the other restaurant. The fact that it's a good way to get into Sky Garden last minute and enjoy the view from your table (most of the tables are against the window), this place is definitely worth its price, moreso for a special occasion.",

The ambiance is a cool vibe & those who know how to dress for this type of venue will like it...more on that below.There is live music in the gardens & it was good too.Food. Very nice. You will forget it later but of the 3 mains we had the only issue was the totally inedible, erm, coleslaw? The burger was nice, the chips better than nice. Fish cake, light, flaky & well seasoned. Risotto, creamy and a good portion too! The prices are as expected, at least for the very pricey starters. The mains were actually more reasonable. The drinks were on point albeit a bit pricey at \u00a311.50 for cocktails but there are other options.3 - They turn tables, so while you're enjoying the lovely vibe & proper background music; keep in mind you will be asked (gently) to vacate after your 2hrs are up. I like that, it ensures you do not invite your friends who have no concept of time.2 - Attire. Even if you have not been here, the location and promo of this place makes it clear how you should be dressed. Shame on folks rocking up with their grimiest attire & actually shame on the venue for allowing this. It will inevitable become something it was not meant to be over time.1 - My 1st visit but I will return.Well done!",

Isn't that always the case?Well its definitely true for Darwin Brassiere which is located on the 36th of the walkie talkie tower.We ordered the salmon and duck leg with triple fried chips and steamed spinach. Everything was incredibly bland tasting and not cooked very well. My duck was particularly dry. Service was also quite slow but expected in such a touristy setting.If you're looking to check out the great views of London head to the Sky Lounge for some cocktails instead of wasting your money here. We didn't even manage to do that as London has been so foggy lately :(.",

The service at Darwin was bloody awful. The food is completely overpriced for basic dishes. The waitress was never around, forgot various items, dropped a knife on one of us, and then took about 30 minutes to get us the check. We asked for a side salad and what came out had no dressing and what appeared to be just freshly pulled weeds from a garden. I would never go back. Don't waste your time on the food. Just go to the Sky Bar for a drink and views.",

We were lucky enough to be squeezed onto a table without a reservation during an impromptu visit to the Sky Garden so if you're here and you fancy it, do give it a shot. Along with the fancy chips I had a fancy burger - pulled duck with a duck egg - which was utterly delicious. It came with red cabbage ketchup which was sweet and gorgeous. I also had a strawberry cocktail which had so many layers of flavour it kept changing as I swallowed each sip. Previous reviews don't speak too highly of the food but for the price you pay - honestly, less than twice the cost of my usual at Byron - it was great and would be perfect for a treat. Obviously, the view is incredible, especially if you're facing the front of the building. However the food does itself justice on its own and I'd definitely bring people back here in the future.",

It was a treat for an anniversary, a quick breakfast that would astonish and amaze my girlfriend as a suprise to begin the day. I think the location was more exciting than the breakfast, as I know a dozen around my local area who could do the same thing. However amongst all the pleasantries, the food was very good. The service was friendly albeit, too formal prehaps for breakfast but it does serve the well off and they require attendance. Having my water topped up while im noshing down on good salmon and eggs frankly is more irritating than useful. I have hands, I can do it myself. Sounds grumpy but thats how I felt.Although I really like it, the decor and quality that went into the design to the food and simplicity. It was worthwhile.

So a windows doesn't give you more view than any other tables).Try the Salsa as a cocktail, made with chilli, it has a real kick to hit.Starters:- terrine was nice a tasty, go for it - beef carpaccio: a must! Love the truffle spread - Prawn cocktail: was good but 3 medium shrimps and 1 big one for \u00a313.50 isn't worth itMain:Pork belly; great, big piece of pork, tender and juicyCheek OX: really good and tasty tooBurger: just a burger, bit average to be honest, U can passvenison pie: great, tasty, good portion. The Kale (side, which come with it) was deliciousWine: 3 selections of red wines by the glass or carafe, reasonably priced too.

There is a \u00a325 penalty fee per person if you cancel within 24 hours of your reservation or don't show up.We were very hungry so we ordered a lot: bread to start, tomato gazpacho, and steak tartare. For the main dishes, we got the Confit Duck Leg and Roast Pork Belly. We also ordered truffle parmesan fries and a glass of red wine.Decent portion sizes, good flavor profiles. The gazpacho reminded me of pico de gallo salsa. The butter for the bread didn't taste like anything. The duck confit was a little dry but still flavorful due to the 5 spice jus. The pork belly was extremely tender and accompanied by a sweet cranberry sauce; interesting combination but it worked! Lots of parmesan on the fries with subtle notes of truffle.For me, the highlight of the meal was steak tartare. That dish was phenomenal. Everything else was very okay, it wasn't bad but the food alone is not worth the price. The upcharge is essentially for the ambience and location.Darwin Brasserie is situated in the center of the Sky Garden on the 36th floor. If you're expecting unobstructed views of the city, you won't get it at this restaurant. But you'll still get some type of view.Overall impression: decent overpriced food, good for special occasions. I'd recommend visiting the Sky Garden and leaving to eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Great spot for a holiday lunch with my team in London!This was my first time at Sky Garden, and I definitely loved not having to wait in line. Those without reservations had to wait in line outside in the rain, another like inside for security, another line for the lifts. We breezed right through and had time to grab a drink before lunch.Darwin was a great spot for lunch. We did the festive menu, if you opt for that then everyone at the table has to do it. All of the food was excellent, as was the service. The portions were perfectly sized to allow us to enjoy and finish all three courses, without feeling stuffed.I would definitely go back - and if you order off the regular menu it isn't quite as pricey as the festive menu - well worth it to see the Sky garden and avoid the lines.",

    "text": "The Sky Garden offers a 360-degree panoramic view of London in a charming and trendy environment that you probably can't find anywhere else. \u00a0Admission is free, but the catch is that you will need to obtain a timed admission ticket from its website. \u00a0Getting a free ticket, especially for a weekend, is close to impossible. \u00a0You pretty much have to be online the moment the tickets are released and grab them right away. \u00a0Fast fingers win!Another way to get in is to have a restaurant reservation. \u00a0Fenchurch is a formal dining restaurant - the white table cloth type - which wasn't my type of place in this environment.So I chose Darwin, which is a brasserie with a casual elegance and upbeat vibes. \u00a0I also love its perfect location, overlooking my most favorite icon - the Tower Bridge.***NOTE: \u00a0Restaurant reservations are difficult to get too. \u00a0I booked mine two weeks in advance. \u00a0Also note that restaurant reservations require a credit card guarantee. \u00a0If your reservation is not cancelled 48 hours in advance, there will be a non-refundable GBP25 fee per person. \u00a0Yup, a party of four no-show will cost you GBP100 (USD130).We made an 8pm reservation and we arrived at the Sky Garden an hour earlier to enjoy the beauty of one of my most favorite cities in the World. \u00a0We were also lucky enough to score a window table that gave us a spectacular view during dinner (see picture!)As for the food, my expectations are always reasonably low for these types of places. \u00a0The Chicken Milanese was like a schnitzel - breaded and fried. \u00a0The meat was tender but it was rather bland in flavor and not exciting at all.The presentation of the stone bass was quite nice though, with the slightly burnt and crispy skin served separately from the fish itself (see picture.) \u00a0The skin was yummy, almost like the skin of a salmon skin roll in a sushi place. \u00a0The fish was also quite good, but short of being memorable.Overall, if you are visiting London and can't get your hand on a free admission ticket to the Sky Garden, I would recommend dining in Darwin for an enjoyable meal and an amazing view. \u00a0But remember to keep your expectations on the food reasonable.Three stars for the food, but five stars for the location, view, atmosphere, and environment. \u00a0Average = 4 stars.",

The hostesses were very friendly and kind, and our waitress was patient, informative, and apologetic for being so busy. It was very busy, and I think we waited probably an hour for the food. The view was also superb. It's a really cool place, so I would certainly recommend visiting Sky Garden, because it's stunning.The food, however, is a bummer. We ordered the smoked fish starter, a grilled fennel quinoa salad, and sea bass with octopus for the mains. The smoked fish was nice. The quinoa salad was really sad. It was a giant pile of quinoa, on top of some yogurt, and 4 very small slices of fennel over it. That's all. I know I sound bitchy, but they took forever and there was nothing to that quinoa. The sea bass was ok. It was cooked nicely and tasted good. The octopus wasn't what I expected- just a few thin slivers of meat. Strange? Anyway, the view and service were great, but that's about it.",

If you don't show up or cancel within 48 hours of your reservation, you will be charged \u00a325 per person. They also have a very strict dress code; no sneakers, flip flops, and shorts. When I was on the ground floor, I saw so many people getting turned down from entrance. There's also a security check in the lobby.At Darwin Brasserie, you're paying for the nice view, so be prepared for some pricey food. The waiter asked if I wanted to start with olives and bread and I said sure... I was disappointed when I got my check because I had been charged for the olives that I had barely touched.I ordered the roast pork belly and it was simply delicious. I loved the apple sauce that was used to decorate the plate; it really complemented the pork belly. I would order it again if I were to go back.After your meal at Darwin Brasserie, you're free to roam around the Sky Garden for as long as you want. It was a great way for me to spend my last night in London.-- taste / 4aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 4price for quality / 3OVERALL / 4.2",

If you're just visiting, give yourself some time to head up to the Sky Garden and have a look around the garden and the view of London. It's free to do so. Make sure you arrive at a minimum of 15 minutes before your reservation, as it could take awhile to get through security (PS - the floor-level workers/security are not friendly/helpful, FWIW). The drink I got was fantastic. Great presentation, fresh fruits, well balanced. The bartender even saw I was taking a pic and scooched out of the way (#DoItForTheGram). The food I got was solid. Definitely expensive for portion size - this isn't a cheap meal. Service at the bar and in the restaurant was solid and efficient. I would definitely go back, but not solo. Would come here to check out the Sky Garden solo, for sure, but if I came back to it'd it would be with a friend/date for a special occasion.",

I booked a weekend brunch for my husband and I...as I could never *quite* get it together to get us passes to the Skygarden, which are free but are booked out quickly. So, reservations at Darwin it was! I booked a month in advance and got 930am on a Saturday -- kind of early. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like we were eating at a hotel. Not bad, but not...great. For the price, the view and the surroundings, I felt it should be great. My salmon on rye with scrambled eggs was so bland I wondered if it was actually smoked salmon. There was literally zero flavor in the entire dish. It was almost weird. The other option is a continental buffet -- THAT def made me feel like we were at a hotel. Higher end, yes. But still...My cocktail was lovely, but at nearly 15 quid -- it should be heaven sent, no? It as a fancy mimosa and I enjoyed it very much, so no complaints except for that price tag. Fair enough. The service was AOK -- totally fine. The view was immense. So, all in all -- yes! The view! Cocktails! But it just felt like Darwin had such potential to be great, and it's pretty status quo all around. I'm glad we did it but I would definitely just return for the Skygarden, it's a treat.",

    "text": "I've been to the Sky Garden a few times - once at the bar, another time for yoga in the morning - but last weekend was the first time I had tried one of the two restaurants at the top. I didn't know much about them, but my friend organised her birthday dinner at the Darwin Brasserie, which turns out to be the more popular of the two. We took the lift to reach the restaurant, and the buttons are unhelpfully both labelled \"Restaurant,\" so we got a brief peek at the Fenchurch Restaurant on the top floor before being told we were on the wrong floor and to go downstairs. The Fenchurch Restaurant was almost entirely empty on a Friday night, save for two people at the bar. Looking at the menu, it might have something to do with the fact that their mains are all \u00a330... they should probably just give up on the fine dining thing (they're not in Mayfair, you can't charge that much!) and expand Darwin Brasserie there as well.The less pretentious option, Darwin Brasserie, was very busy and popular on Friday night. When we arrived for our booking at 7 PM, we were told that we had the table until 9:30 PM, after which I suppose they have enough demand so as to have a late seating. We ordered starters while we waited for a few late guests that had gotten caught up at work or in the security queue downstairs. I got the chicken liver parfait, which is a bit expensive at \u00a311, but it was nice, save for the fact that they never give you enough bread relative to the big block of parfait that you get. We put in our orders for mains around 7:20 PM, and particularly given that we were a group of 5, they came out extraordinary quickly, like within 15 minutes. We were done eating two courses by 8 PM. I didn't love my duck confit because it clearly still had some feathers on it, and it wasn't particularly tender either. There were no particularly standout dishes on the menu... certainly nothing I'm dying to come back for.Since we had the table for another hour and a half, and it's impossible to get seating at the bar downstairs if you haven't booked, we decided to order another bottle of wine and enjoy our seats. Around 9 PM one of the staff came over and tried to kick us out, probably trying to make room for the big group waiting at the door, but I politely told her that we had been told that we had the table until 9:30 PM, and after she checked with someone else, she said it was ok and that we could stay. Then later when we paid the bill, we split the gratuity amongst the 5 of us and there may be have been some rounding when the card machine came around, because another member of staff came over after and told us that we were \u00a31.50 or so short. At that point, we thought it was the most ridiculous thing and told him to take it off the gratuity. It was clearly not a large amount and probably happened as an honest mistake, but the fact that he came over and asked for it when gratuity is optional just left a bad taste in our mouths.Overall, I think Darwin Brasserie is rather missable, and you are better off booking a table at the Sky Pod Bar. Darwin Brasserie is able to attract diners just by location alone, and it may be an easier reservation to get, but clearly they have some work to do in the food and service department. Meanwhile, the bar has some food like charcuterie and cheese (much harder to mess that up), and it's a much better view and atmosphere. The restaurants are weirdly located at the back of the building, but on a higher level. At Darwin Brasserie, we had one of the tables closest to the Thames, which is still like only in the middle of the building, and we couldn't even tell which building was the Shard, because the structure blocked out the top of the buildings. Views from most of the other tables must be even worse! All of the tables at the bar have amazing views, and it's also a much better place to take photos.",

    "text": "Trying to book a free visit to the Sky Garden, or even their Sky Pod for drinks is near impossible during off-work hours as soon as the weather warms up in London. So we opted for the third least expensive option - Darwin.Sky Garden is worth the trip. The 360 degree view of london is something that no other skyscraper restaurants in the city can provide (e.g. duck & waffle). However great Darwin's seating was (we had a good one by the window), there are no restaurants that close to the garden edge that provided you with the same feel. But still a great view. If you do end up booking a restaurant in order to go up, just try to go up early and hang out there for a bit before your actual reservation time.The food, on the other hand, was sub par. The night started with a list of cocktails I ordered and and the server came back telling me they were unavailable. The drink i did end up getting was nothing spectacular, though it was packaged nicely in a cool tiki cup.The duck confit burger and the cod with octopus salad were unmemorable. There's really no word to describe it other than...meh...it's okay. Come here for the view, dont expect too much from the food, and be okay with the prices, and you will fare okay.",

    "text": "We went to Darwin's for breakfast, which I would highly recommend. First, because at 8:30-9 ish, there are very few people up in the SkyGarden (which opens to reserved entrances at 10:30) and the place is extra majestic when not filled with people snapping pictures everywhere. Second, the breakfast options at least, are reasonable. The eggs Benedict at 11 quid is about 2-3 quids more than what you would get at any pub. I got the pancakes and porridge both of which were great. The highlight though of this trip was the views. We were seated by the window so that probably helped too. Docked off one star for service. Although most of the staff we dealt with were nice, the servers who brought our food were a bit rude. Darwin should do something about this, as rude servers at such a beautiful place really dampens the whole experience. Lovely overall.",

    "text": "The views from here are amazing and it's definitely worth a shot for a tourist who cannot make it to the Skygarden. The reservation has to be made online where there is 25\u00a3 charge per person charge for missing the reservation.There is thorough security in the building that allows entry to the restaurants after checking your reservation. On arriving, one can do a coat/small bag check in at the restaurant. I was glad to be seated by the glass pane and have a good view. Initially, the staff was very attentive. The wine and food was good. I could not finish my main course and asked them if I could do a to-go. They did not say no, which would have been fine. Instead, they took more than 20 minutes figuring out a to-go and got me a waiver form which claimed that they were not responsible for quality of food once it's taken out of the restaurant. It may be perfectly normal but \u00a0it was my first encounter where I had to sign a waiver for a take-away and I mentally questioned myself \"Why did I even ask for it?!\". The box they gave me was so delicate that it did not last the rain anyway. While exiting the building, it suddenly started raining heavily and the security drove people away like they were hawkers or beggars, not even giving a chance to put on their rain jackets. Too normal for London may be...!",

    "text": "Let's do brunch with a view. On Sundays Darwin brasserie does an impressive brunch for \u00a338. It sounds a big expensive, but you are getting A LOT of food for that price.Start with the buffet with ham, salads, cheese, bread, then choose a main from their menu (it goes from traditional breakfast meals to full sunday roast).I tried the egg benedict with crab (a nice twist, although not the best eggs I tried) and I had a glimpse at the beef roast, which featured a HUGE slice of meat.If you're still hungry you can then help yourself to the sweets buffet (donuts, cheesecake, brownie). Main feature of the brunch for me was the smoothie and bloody mary bar. It's included in the price and you can get as many as you want. Also there's a nice view",
