    "text": "Young Cheng in the heart of London's Chinatown has been on my radar for a few months ever since my Dad bought some superior take-away Cantonese BBQ there. I finally got round to eating at this restaurant the other week. I was going to order some three roasts noodles before another dish caught my eye. Fuzhou fish ball ho fun in soup (\u00a35.50) screamed out to me from the lunch menu and was begging to be ordered. However, I had some reservations owing to some bad fish ball experiences at HK Diner and Fuzhou Restaurant. Thankfully, this bowl of noodles went someway in restoring my faith in the humble fish ball. After all, I could have no complaints about the generous helping of six puffy fish balls filled with ground pork complemented by slippery smooth ho fun noodles in a bowl of clean tasting broth. The fish balls were reassuringly misshapen, which to me indicated that they were own-made but sadly they weren't that 'QQ' or springy. That said, the ground pork filling \u00a0the defining feature of Fuzhou fish balls \u00a0was juicy and flavoursome. The broth would've been a tad plain but for some fried garlic bits that ever so subtly gave it a lift. I also bought a portion of take-away roast belly pork. This had nice crispy crackling and plenty of five-spice flavour. A winner and a bargain at \u00a35.50; I'll be sure to return and sample the rest of their roast meats. I visited the Lisle St branch of Young Cheng, there are a couple of others in Chinatown, and it's a bit of an 'all things to all people' kind of joint. At lunchtime, it serves dim sum and one-dish meals whilst the main \u00e0 la carte selection includes Cantonese favourites of both the hard-core and tourist-friendly variety. In common with many Chinatown joints, service was fast and furious but without being too brusque. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.\u2026",

The most important- food it is not greasy. I have tried number of dishes there and there are ok. Not always tasted the same \u00a0different chef \u00a0different flavour but the food is good and reasonable. Service- a bit slow but I have my favourite 2 waitress that before I sit they serve me tea and ask if I want to order my regular food. So I do not have to waste my time. In regards to all authentic Chinese food lover I do recommend to travel to china where you get a proper food made from local ingredients, do not expect the same taste in London.But any time i go there there is plenty of Chinese people sitting there and they seems to be happy with the food. I do recommend this place for good food and good prices.",

Having sampled the real thing in Hong Kong, the authenticity of the cuisine is attested to not only by me but the many Chinese who choose to eat there. What better recommendation is there?I was there again on Saturday last, with a group of 4. We had a shared starter of roast crispy duck, pancakes and hoisin sauce, which was exquisite, followed by tiger prawns and rice, Singapore noodles, Char Siu pork, chicken in black bean and a couple of other dishes. With drinks, the bill for the 4 of us came to just over \u00a380. It was terrific value for a superb meal.I do recommend this place.",

Yum yum, said my tum. It's rare to find suckling pig and I take full advantage when I see some for sale.Supposedly discovered by a Chinese swineherd who accidentally set fire to his occupied pig-shed, Chinese suckling pig has the most divine moist sweet meat with an unmistakable layer of crisp skin, which will stay crispy for days. Not that it will last for days or even hours in my house!I confirmed with the chef that they offer suckling pig here every Sunday and I left with my piggy booty to enjoy at home. I'll be back!",

This one serves Chinese-style lobster or crab at a resonable price. The lobster is served stir fry with ginger and spring onion on a bed of noodle. The crab you can go woth ginger and spring onions or with curry sauce. Both are nice but the curry sauce I found spicy.There are many Canton Chinese dishes served here which make it popular with many Chinese families to dine here for a casual dinner. So if you do decide to come here with friends, families or relatives it is always best to reserve a table to avoid waiting for a table. But of course u can skip booking and just go at times when it is quiet - times of the day where you do expect people to have dinner! Note during lunch hours they mainly opened to serve dim sum.I have so many favoruite dishes here including the honey pepper eel (it is just another type of fish!), salted baked chicken, crab with vermicelli noodle hotpot, salt and pepper squid...the list goes on. These are just the few I recommend to friends when I take them to have food the Chinese the Canton way!",

The taste was authentic and yummy.The service was a bit weird. 3-4 servers would be standing by the door talking and joking to each other the entire time, but they arent really attentive, though they will be there if you call them.Again, good place and would have been one star higher if they food was fresher.",

The fact that they had huge DIM SUM stickers on the front helped aswell :3So yup, Young Cheng actually looks like every random Chinese restaurant you'll see, with the same kind of menu. My friend and I went for some of the \"safe\" choices, our Chinese being limited.Note that dishes here are served like they would do in China; they are served collectively in the middle of the table and not individually. Hence the wierd face of one of the waiters when insisitng that the dim sum was mine (MY DIM SUM).The food was super yum yum - friend went for sweet and sour chicken, and I went for a noodle soup on top of the dim sum. Tasty, generous, what I expected.Lunch turned out at 15\u00a3 each with starter/main course/drinksDownside?- Service was very average. No smiles, nearly hostile. Was it because we were noobs?- Chinese ladies sitting next to us had a food orgy (without joking) - having about 7 different with tea and drinks, and paied less than 12\u00a3 each - leading me to suspect a different price grid on the menu written in Chinese.Will probably go back, but then again... so many Chinese restaurants in China town to try!",

Most of the kitchen staff has been transferred from Mayflower earlier this year so expect similar quality. The roast chicken dishes here are a must try, very moist and flavoursome at a very affordable price at the same time. Other classic dishes such as stewed lamb hot pot and steamed minced pork are also worth trying. The downside of Young Cheng is it hasn't got the best service and lack of space as tables are extremely close to one another.",

After 15 minutes of waiting I phoned up my friend wondering where they were, only to find out I was at the wrong restaurant! The Young Cheng they were seated in is on Lisle Street, two blocks away from the Young Cheng I was standing in front of on Shaftesbury. Make sure you get the right one if you are meeting friends!The restaurant is very cramped but that's not unusual for Chinese restaurants particularly in Chinatown of London. The six of us had six dishes plus rice and tea to share and finished with oranges and red bean soup dessert (as is traditional in good Chinese restaurants!) and the bill came to \u00a313 a head - not bad for central London, although I would say portion size erred towards the small side.I am never quite sure which Chinese restaurant to go to in Chinatown since there are so many, and the quality could be hit-or-miss since they tend to cater to tourist trade. However, I would recommend Young Cheng (on Lisle Street!) for their authentic food - give their fried frog legs a try if you are adventurous!",

Each time, service was up to par and the quality of the food was consistent. While dim sum was expensive as compared to New York, I would definitely say it is Young Cheng's strong point. All the brunch favorites are there and even a few new things. I recommend the scallop cheungfun and the coconut pudding.As for a lunch/dinner dish, try the Fuzhou fried rice (with asparagus and roasted duck).",

    "text": "In many ways, Young Cheng is THE prototypical Soho Chinese restaurant: It's cramped, crowded, loud - the service rushed and unfriendly. In short, not a place to linger. Unfortunately, Young Cheng is not only all of these things, but more so. The waiters, of which there were plenty, disregarded the customers and rather spent time chatting amongst each other. They were *extremely* unfriendly, service without even a single smile, or a word. I wanted to try their Dim Sum to compare them with my favorite dim sum place in Soho, Wan Chai Corner on Gerrard, and arrived just at 12 a.m. opening time. Within ten minutes the place was packed with customers, many of them Chinese. It being such a small joint, things got loud very fast indeed. Which didn't make the staff faster in their tracks.The dim sum themselves were of good quality, but not better than at several other such places, and at roughly the same prices. Once I'd finished my meal I wanted to get the hell out of Young Cheng, and will probably never return to it. The dim sum at Wan Chai Corner are just as good, the service much \"friendlier\" (a relative term at Soho Chinese joints) - there's just nothing that distinguishes Young Cheng in any - positive - way.",

Ordered the following:Won ton soup - lots of meaty dumplings, really good!Pork pot stickers - very good, always a good starter.House special chow mein - there was clearly a miscommunication as this came with no meat. We didn't notice the lack of protein until halfway through. Meh.Beef w/ ginger & spring onions - this was basically Mongolian beef w/ some heavier ginger flavors. Vegetable spring rolls and veggie curry were also ordered but I didn't try those.Service was as expected at an Asian restaurant, although the servers here seemed a little more attentive. The restaurant was small and on the cozy side. While it wasn't the best Chinese food I've had, it was good and it hit the spot.",

All the classics were done to a high standard, and they even throw in free pork broth to get your meal kickstarted! Unfortunately, I think Young Cheng's glory days are behind them now, as the dim sum has started to slip to just pretty much the Chinatown \"meh\" average. Shu mai was rubbery, the lo bak go was lacking in punch even with XO sauce, and the 3 roast meat with rice was both underwhelming and extremely fatty. Chinatown restaurant standards seem to come and go, and I'll more than likely pop back in here again in a few months to see if it's improved again, as there are moments where I can see where my faith was originally placed! The char siu baos have big chunks of meat, the pork soup to start is really good, and the fried noodles are well seasoned. Worth popping to if you're looking for somewhere new that's good value, but for now, not the top of my list!",

    "text": "I have been to dim sum in Chinatown on several occasions, but none were particularly memorable and I have yet to find a go-to place. So when my friend and I were looking for dim sum after a morning at the National Portrait Gallery, we did some research and saw Young Cheng mentioned on a list of dim sum restaurants recommended my Asian chefs, so decided to give it a try. Even though it was 2 PM, there was still a queue to be seated, and we waited about 10 minutes with around 8 people in front of us. We then got a nice table upstairs with a menu in English and photos with numbers that matched up with a checklist style menu entirely in Chinese. They have some interesting selections like dim sum with scallop, or crab. We chose what we wanted very quickly, handed it to the server, and it was not long before our food arrived.The dishes easiest to compare would be the prawn dumplings and the Shanghai style soup dumplings. I thought the former was a lot more vibrantly pink than your typical prawn dumpling, and my friend hypothesized that this was because it was a crystal style dim sum, with a more translucent wrapping. I quite enjoyed it. The Shanghai style soup dumpling is mediocre, ok but there is definitely better in the neighbourhood (this can be partially forgiven because soup dumplings are not real dim sum food). I really liked the turnip cake; I thought it was very delicate and not over fried, and it fell apart almost like tofu. We also got the scallop dumplings and the cheung fun, which were both good as well.Overall I thought the dim sum was solid and have no major complaints. Our meal, including a pot of tea, came out to \u00a312, which is pretty reasonable. That said, my favourite dim sum place in London is still Dragon Castle in Elephant & Castle, followed closely by Pearl Liang in Paddington, and I'm not in a rush to come back to Yeung Cheng. It's just very convenient.",

The meat on the shrimp dumplings were subpar; the shrimp stuffing was a bit dry.2. The skin on the shanghai dumplings broke easily 3. The cheung fun dishes were a bit starchy.4. My favourite Liu Sha Bao (although rather tasty) had a bit too much dough 5. Their unique dishes (curry deepfried seafood dumpling) was just an odd mixture of of crispy pastry, oil and curry.My overall view of this dim sum restaurant is that it has the potential to do better. At this point, I would rather try a new restaurant than come back here.(I probably sound kinda mean, but I'm just referring to the dim sum component of this restaurant. Their roast pork and roast duck looks fabulous and I'd love to come back for other dishes like that)",

Fine, this is the last time I come to this place, no matter how fantastic their food is ( the truth is that their food is very average).So I STRONGLY suggested anyone who is considering this place, before you get mad and want to throw all the plates and glasses on the table, please choose somewhere else in Chinatown, they all much better than here, at least in terms of service.",

    "text": "It's been a while since dim sum in Chinatown. My previous favourite place being Top of the town which unfortunately closed at the start of the year. Dumpling Legends just opposite looks promising, but I can't stomach the prices and the fact I usually see very few chinese people eating there. However that is starting to change, so maybe it's good now.Anyway the search was on for a replacement and a friend suggested this place or Joy King Lau for good dim sum. The decision was difficult, but eventually we settled on Young Cheng this time.There is another restaurant on Shaftesbury avenue with the same name and similar storefront. However the insides of both are widely different. This branch does dim sum, and looks a lot busier, cleaner and professional than the other. Service is quick and efficient. Ordering dim sum as simple as looking at a picture, taking down the number and marking that on carbon paper. Not a word need be spoken (apart from requesting extra chilli of course!)The dim sum was great. Nothing spectacular here. But all filling, tasty and well portioned. The chilli oil mixed with chilli sauce was especially delish. It was just the right amount of spice and complimented the steamed dim sum perfectly. One standout dish was the chicken's feet. The sauce was fantastic. Get this is you want something a little off the beaten track.To to recap, great service, great food, nice atmosphere, good value, perfect portions. For two people, 8-9 dishes is close to the sweet spot in terms of portioning. This will set you back about \u00a324-28 incl. service and the obligatory tea of course. I'm next to try Joy King Lau, but at present, this will be my regular joint for the forseeable future.",

They give you soup which i thought was awesome! Again, it's cramped but it was filling up when i had lunch! I would come back again since the dim sum was yummy.",

    "text": "I've never had stellar dim sum in China town, but they've all been edible and great place to catch up with my friends. (Chinese or otherwise, but mainly chinese. Oh god, , I hope I don't sound like a raging racist. Should I just stop talking now?)Anyways, I actually planned to go imperial china, but I sneaked a peek next door whilst waiting for my mates in the F-UREEEEEZING cold and young cheng sells har gow and other usual pieces for a pound cheaper than imperial china. So that pretty much swung the vote. I measure most place by two criteria. Har gow skin, and also the soup in the XLB. Both passed. The har gow skin wasthin, translucent and not too thick at the top. There was only a bit of soup in the XLB, it could've been better, but one of the better ones I've had in Chinatown. The custard bun was better than the charsiu bun, and thats rarely the case anywhere, so that was a bit weird. The other things were just okay. I didn't get \u00a0MSG hangover so that's good. (What is up with those!)I just wasn't wowed. But if you want a sound dim sum meal. This is pretty close. We ordered a total of 17 dimsums between the 5 of us and the total came to \u00a361. So about \u00a313 pp which isn't cheap but it's reasonable.",

Hot food is always being replenished and staff constantly check if you need further drinks.There is another branch on Shaftesbury, and, though either will give you great service, I think Shaftesbury a trifle dearer.",
