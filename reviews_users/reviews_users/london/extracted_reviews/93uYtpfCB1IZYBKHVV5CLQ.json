The staff are really nice, and it's really quiet, so handy for a quiet lunch with a friend or two.There's only very limited seating but they'll happily make you a fresh dish if you go in to sit down.

I went on Yelp and found this place, which had really good reviews. It was walking distance from the Landmark Apartments building we were staying at. I also noticed that we would get a free item when we checked in, so I was excited. We walked in and looked through the menu and then placed our order. I told the cashier that I just checked in on Yelp and confirmed that I would be getting a free item. She smiled and said yes. As they were making the sushi, we sat at a table. The place was nice, small and clean. About 20 minutes later we received our rolls. I believe we order 3 rolls. One being a dragon roll, shrimp tempura and the third one had salmon. Presentation was nice, but taste could've been way better. As I kept eating it, I started feeling nauseous. I had about 5 pieces and that was enough for me. They never gave us the free check in item, and I'm glad they didn't.",

    "text": "I went here clearly expecting a slightly-better-than-Wasabi experience. Because I knew it was small, and they did stuff pre-packaged. But slightly better than Wasabi is still good right? So when we arrived, I saw it was tiny and that they told us there that we could select something out of the fridge. Or there was hot food. Or they had a few other things on the menu. For lunch, you can add Miso or a sushi surprise for \u00a31 (\u00a32 for both), but if you check in on your lovely Yelp app, the surprise is free. Ours turned out to be some blowtorched salmon and sun dried tomato nigiri sushi. And it was delicious.Because I'm insane and willing to spend a ridiculous amount of money on lunch, I opted for the sashimi platter. And some kimchi. Which isn't Japanese, but I love the stuff (plus vegetables, right?). The cashier warned me the kimchi was hot, but I didn't believe him. Because I like my hot food to blow my face off, and I knew it wasn't going to be that hot. (And it wasn't, but it was still spicy and delicious). My sashimi came out. It was FLIPPING GORGEOUS! Looked great on the plate and each piece came with something unusual. The tuna had some pickled wasabi on top. Yum. There were some crunchy bits and mayonnaise-y bits and other bits, and it was all delicious. (I even tried someone's gyoza. Also delicious.) Also some nice miso soup.It's a small venue (maybe 8 or 9 chairs in total), and even if you \"eat in\" and order from the menu, everything is served on throwaway plastic or paper crockery. So doesn't expect anything extravagant. What you can expect is some delicious sushi. Also don't expect a huge amount of variety. There isn't. But what there is is really good.",

I officially have a sushi problem...This cute little sushi venue is about a 1 minute walk behind Itsu on Great Eastern Street. Why are you going to Itsu? Stop right now! Sushi Surprise has the fattest, freshest fish, lovingly prepared, and the rice is cooked to perfection, like little jewels of joy. Once you've tasted the quality and freshness on offer here you'll never want to go back to any of the chain sushi restaurants.The prices seem a little sporadic, but look closer and you'll see it's priced directly by the cost of the fish on offer. I regularly pick up the salmon/avocado rolls & nigiri lunch set for a VERY reasonable \u00a34.90. Cheaper and bigger than Itsu, and SO much tastier. The tuna boxes are a little more, and then there are a bunch of specials to choose from which range from around \u00a36 to \u00a39.50. They look simply incredible.The chef clearly loves his job, and chats to me like a regular. I sometimes partake in one of his little cheeky 'surprises' and it always delights.Give it a try, it will change your mind about sushi forever.",

The best thing about Sushi Surprise for me though has to be the astounding standard of vegetarian sushi on offer. I'm used to being fobbed off with the usual avocado and cucumber affairs, but the veggie sushi box blew me away. The prices are slightly higher than I'd usually spend on lunch (more than a fiver) but I like to go at least once a week for a treat, as the meal packages are clearly prepared with real care and attention, and look beautiful as well as tasting fresh and delicious.",

While the prices match these unexciting bland places, Sushi Surprise is not so! Firstly, I was excited by my free sushi surprise for checking in and within a moment, my mouth was just as excited! Ze master sushi chef handpicked a beautiful piece of salmon, drizzled teriyaki bbq sauce on it and then emblazened with a hand torch. Voila. A masterpiece in my mouth!Then, the very friendly lady at the cashier asked if I wanted the lunch special and when she realised I didn't know what that was and asked if this was my first time, I got the miso soup for free! First timers get free miso soup, folks!So I walked away with my takeout, already happy with this discovery and THEN! When I tasted the sushi is when the real magic happened. So much flavour! So much subtle addition! I got the salmon, california, and kim chee rolls for \u00a34.50 and each one of these was incredible and better than anything I've ever gotten in a box. Like Pamela said, I almost felt guilty about adding soy sauce to the rolls as it may obscure some of these flavours and not do it justice! (and I looove soy sauce too!) Can't wait to try all their other sushi and be treated to more surprises!",

    "text": "We had a wonderful experience at Sushi Surprise.My wife and I were in town and craving Sushi and decided on SS largely from the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.I have a high standard when it comes to sushi quality and this place exceeded expectations.Since they are mostly geared for take away and delivery, do not expect much in terms of a store front, but the quality and and price can't be matched near downtown.We spoke with the manager Ken who described how the fish is brought in daily at 6 AM to insure freshness which is demonstrated from the results!Highly recommend. Try the barbecue salmon nigiri / sashimi. It's lightly cooked with a blow torch so you must eat it quickly, but out of this world.Thanks Ken & sushi chefs for the wonderful experience.",

In fairness, I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if that were an option.

    "text": "Indeed this place was a surprise! Finally, I've found good sushi in London!There are very few places that I would recommend for sushi in London and this is one of them. Usually it's a mound of rice, badly rolled with soft fillings... however not here! They had a lovely fresh selection which was beautifully, artistically made, stuffed with fresh, crunchy and fillings and topped with yummy fresh fish.I absolutely love that they have the fridge stockers, but will make you hot food (including Gyoza) and other fresher items to order. I couldn't help but drool at the cut fish and imagine what these offerings would taste like. Why is this place not closer to me for lunch?As it was close to closing time, we opted for the premium roll selection (around \u00a312 eat in) from the fridge, and have to say that the veggie special roll was my favourite - so fresh and crispy! However the dragon roll and rainbow roll were also fantastic. Melting in the mouth and so flavourful. A good tip is that they offer these 2 for 1 at the end of the day (great if you're happy to hedge your bets and have an early dinner)... Also being lucky enough to check in with the Yelp #YelptoberFeast we received a free salmon nigiri selection, which was absolutely delicious. It came beautifully seared and presented. I could easily have finished off a stack of those! I hope they start offering them as standard (the're not on the menu).The staff were also very friendly and informative, and I left bulging at the seams.A great place, with real fast food at its best... especially with take away an option. I really recommend you check these guys out, they are well worth going off the beaten track for.",

    "text": "Sushi Surprise is probably the best value sushi place in London.I came here a couple of weeks ago on a UYE (unofficial yelp event). I'd heard really good things about this place, so joined a small group of yelpers to try it out. The chefs here have been trained at high end London Sushi restaurants like Yashin and The Arts Club.I's a very small place with a limited amount of high stool tables. I think most of the lunchtime trade is local workers, who take the boxes away and eat back at their workplace.They have a great lunchtime offer, where you order a main and get miso soup for an additional \u00a31, or a surprise for \u00a31 . You can have both for an additiona \u00a31.80. The great thing is, that if you check in with the Yelp app, you get the surprise free. For the surprise included flame seared sushi, where the chef prepared in front of us. The spicy tuna rolls were really tastey. I loved them.They also offer a hot selection, which changes, so you need to ask them or check online to find out what the hot dish of the day is.It's hard the believe that this is an independent establishment, as it has the feel of being part of a chain. In fact the place is so good, I've a feeling that is the first of many Sushi Surprises that will be sprining up over London. Highly recommend Sushi Suprise. It was even worth dragging my limbs from the other side of London to try it out. I will be back!!",

Minimum delivery order is \u00a310 hence ordering the soup. But glad I did now. Fab place will definitely put this on my short list.",

Located about 5 minutes from Liverpool Street I'm seriously tempted to have lunch here every day.I've tried a couple of different things now and I can't fault a single one. From the free Miso soup on my first visit, 2 different chef's surprises (check in on the Yelp app or pay \u00a31) to the salmon and avocado rolls everything has been absolutely delicious. The highlight for me though was the tuna selection. 8 spicy tuna rolls and 3 tuna nigri for less than \u00a39. An absolute steal. They have all of the fresh fish in the counter for the sashimi and this is what I'll be trying next as I doubt I will get better for an affordable price. I can't recommend Sushi Surprise enough and I'll even go as far as to say that this is the best I've had in London. See you there!",

Very fresh and excellent customer service!! They explained the sushi when it was brought to the table ( super nicely decorated) and even suggested to eat it with a certain soya sauce specifically chosen for this type of sushi!!! Sushi tasted amazingly flavourful!! Customer service you would only expect to find in some Michelin star restaurant!!! I wish they would be more recognised for the amazing service and excellent food!! Please alwas tip them as they don't even do the usual 10% service charge because they are too nice!!! Still amazed by this amazing food we had and will definitely go there again!!We paid 40 pounds for 2 people and we had a LOT of sushi!!",

Always unique....always tasty. The surprise often pulls in flavours you wouldn't associate with suishi but never disappoints. favourite so far involved some seared tuna and truffle...I mean truffle is always a good thing by in their capable hands it was a triumph.So if you're in the city and looking for an alternative sushi surprise I highly recommend you pop on by",

I hit them up the other day for a one-person dinner on the way home to get a quick sushi fix. You order online, the process is insanely simple. You just select the rolls you would like, add them to your basket, and can even opt in for a special surprise. Delivery or takeaway, your choice.A good number of options in meat type, salmon, whitefish, tuna, veggie options as well. I'll say the name is not optimal because who really wants their sushi to be a surprise right? We want to know that it's safe considering the raw and fish aspect. But once you get it it's great. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a solid sushi experience when time and cost are a factor. Additionally, it's great for team lunches, easy to order and they offer delivery. We just ordered for a team planning meeting. Everything was on time, ready to go, not one mistake in the whole thing. We fed seven, kept it under \u00a3100 and the group was full at the end. Plus there's hot options as well, including edamame, miso + apps like Gyoza. Yeah, I'm a fan.",

Maybe it's because I agreed to the buy one, get one free special off the shelf.The sushi was surprisingly not great here... The rolls were equivalent to the cold, hard square ones we'd have at grocery stores back at home. My hubby (who is from here) and I were both disappointed though.This is a small, fast-food type location where the rolls are...well...small as well. Is it just us, or are they lacking in flavor? I'm confused; this seems to be a common style of sushi rolls around here, spanning from Birmingham to London. Sleek fillets of fish wrapped in seaweed and it's sushi time! ..Er, is this how England likes their sushi? We're paying for quality-grade *raw* fish, which is a unique culture and art form to be deliciously appreciated. There should be more than a sliver, and a combination of flavors that compliment it's unique succulent bites.",

I was also given a free bbq salmon sushi to whet my appetite while I waited thanks to Yelp's check in offer. One tube ride and half an hour later I was sat at home with my new style sushi box.

The side salad that came with the sushi was surprisingly varied too and also came with its own dressing. 8 pieces was definitely not enough though and it left me empty and wanting more.
