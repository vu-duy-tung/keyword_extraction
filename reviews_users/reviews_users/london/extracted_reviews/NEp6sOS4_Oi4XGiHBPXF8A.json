If you have a preconception that crepes are boring and just stuffed with nutella or plain sugar, Creme de la Crepe will change your mind.

The space is designed very well in case you are looking for a little hide out either with your beloved newspaper, laptop or other half. The wooden decor strikes a great balance between contemporary and homey.They serve super tasty crepes which you can either have sweet or savoury-seriously one of the best I've had in London. The fillings and toppings are of great variation and will fill up your rumbling tummy whilst pleasing your taste buds(click on the website to get going.) The other option include salads, smoothies,milkshakes, coffee..I recommend the Go Fishin' Salad and mango/passionfruit/pineapple smoothie (if you fancy ditching your crape date/looking to ditch some waist inches.)

    "text": "Batter, it's a fabulous thing. It goes well around fish, with sausages and in Scotland, a coating for Mars bars. Here at Creme de la Crepe, hidden in one of the converted arches of Covent Garden's market, they spread it out on a hot skillet and make it into Crepes. Also know as pancakes. Now in the unsuspecting spot you may not expect to find anything of a foodie dream, I mean who really goes here except teenagers and tourist, but you should not judge a book by it's cover. Sickeningly cute with pink and grey polka-dots, the little man made cave is suprisingly light and airy. Another element that caught my eye was the menu. Yes, yes we all know that Nutella needs to be in a crepe but these are \"Creme de la Crepes\", expect a \"Cheap Date\" with Balieys, and a \"Buffalo Bill\" with hot wing sauce and shredded chicken. It's mind blowing what these guys can put in a pancake. After reading Cate S's review and having Laura N practically march me down there for a crepe, I was very happy yet not completely satisfied with my Friday lunch... well on Pancake day I can eat about 5 pancakes, yup it's a family record! So here I would be paying almost \u00a325 for a meal of pancakes, not great value for money. But saying that, as lunch for a little snack, trust these tossers they'll have you full of crepe in no time!",

The creme of the cr\u00eape-crop, if you will... Oh... wait, what's that? You did already? Oh... I see. Right.The only problem is deciding what to order: Are you going to be sacrilegious and order a (gasp) savory pancake? If so, you've gotta go with the Philly Cheese-crepe. Or the buffalo bill. Or the smoked salmon. Or the Italian Job. Or, or, or... (You really can't go wrong.)In the sweet department, it's all about the banoffee pie. It changes lives. Believe. *Quick tip: take a cheeky peek in the corner and you'll see a shrine to American goodies! Marshmallow creme, Mars Bars, Skippy extra crunchy peanut butter, Baby Ruth, Kool-Aid... Oh Yeah!",

I went for the Philly Cheesesteak crepe. It was so good I could of dropped my pants and made love to it. Every mouthful was a mini orgasmic experience. No joke, I was in food nirvana. At \u00a35.50 it was the most expensive crepe. It isn't a meal but adding a sweet crepe as dessert will leave you feeling satisfied like never before. My sources tell me the Banofee Pie crepe is a taste tingling sensation.The cute cave like interior only adds to the wonder of the place. You can also purchase salads and smoothies, but really, you'd be doing yourself a major injustice by missing out on the incredible crepes.Wow, wow, wow. There is a God in heaven, and he is French.",

Unfortunately, Covent Garden haven't sorted them out with a proper sign yet, but once you find Creme de la Crepe it is positively AMAZING.Run by Nick, a lovely chap who reminds of of Jamie Oliver (in all the good ways) Creme de la Crepe is the kind of place I would like to live in if I didn't have any moral standards, respect for others, or regard for my waistline. I would like to live there, install Wifi, and eat savory crepes, the sweet crepes, and then savory crepes, and then maybe a smoothie all the live long day.It would become my own personal Gluttony Palace of Shame.Never mind how awesome the pink, black, and polkadot decor is - let's talk food.The crepes are f***ing STELLAR. Including delicious American-style condiments and sauces such as Buffalo Wing Sauce and Ranch Dressing, the savory crepes will bring anyone to their knees. Plus, with creative names such as \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Cheeky Cow\", \"Piggy that went to Market\" and \"Love Hate Thing\" (made with Marmite, of course) even ordering your crepe is enjoyable. The cute wooden booths, alcoves and its retro, artsy atmosphere make this place one of my favorite finds in London. Savory or sweet, salad or smoothie, Nick and his fantastic and friendly staff will not disappoint. And with your average crepe costing only about \u00a34, I simply can't see where this place goes wrong.",

A native French snack very similar to pancakes, they are normally made with sugar in the ingredients and served with a selection of condiments. Walking into this shop, you quickly realise that you're not going to be sitting down on site and eating one of their delicious crepes, due to the fact they have about 3 seats available. You can argue though that a crepe is a strictly mobile kind of snack, eaten out of your hands on the move. They sell a wide variety, including savoury ones, and the prices aren't 'So' bad, about \u00a33.50 a sweet crepe (try the plain with honey or jam) and \u00a34.80 for a savoury one. They sell some American only chocolate bars as well, though why you'd want to pay in excess of \u00a31.00 I wouldn't know. Most of the workers are young, virile males so I expect they're targeting a female audience! So handsome...",

First of all, the service was super nice and allowed us to substitute ingredients without asking any questions. Secondly, my friend ordered a double shot expresso and the girl serving us was kind enough to ask if she gave my friend enough expresso because the machine didn't pump out as much as it should have. The crepe was DELICIOUS! The chocolate bar mixed with strawberries, ginger cookies, and bananas was the best combination! I shared one with my friend and it was the perfect afternoon snack. The price is reasonable and the food is great! The atmosphere is also pretty cool with several other cool/funny names for other crepes. I was very tempted to try another crepe by myself.

I personally love the Cheeky Monkey crepe (banana and Nutella crepe), but many others enjoy the classic Suzette crepe as well as the cute Banoffee pie crepe.

    "text": "To be honest, the crepe I had here was probably the best food I've had in London so far. I found this place on Yelp and had to give it a try. My friends and I all love crepes. My friends got the \"French Kiss,\" dark chocolate, grand marnier, unrefined sugar and the \"Cheap Date,\" mars bars and baileys. I got the \"Nutty Professor,\" nutella and peanut butter. All of our crepes came in a timely manner, about ten minutes. We did come here on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all. My friend who got the \"French Kiss\" was given the wrong crepe though. They gave her the \"Lady Loves,\" strawberries, dark chocolate and whipped cream. She still enjoyed the crepe but it was their fault for messing it up. My other friend loved her \"Cheap Date\" and my \"Nutty Professor\" was absolutely amazing. Probably one of the best crepes I've ever had. Easily. It was full of flavor and I was so sad when it was all gone. BEST CREPE PLACE IN ALL OF LONDON!",

Having few seatings gives you a nice break to fill up your energy before continue to discover more things in Covent Garden. Or you can always have your take away while watching street performances. Cheeky monkey... Whenever I want to go for savoury crepes, I remember how nice nutella&banana combination in a crepe and it hits the spot! I visited this place quite a lot of time and always had the same one so I cannot judge the other options on the menu. They do tea, almost of kinds of coffees and smoothies. Also few fizzy drinks, juices. If the other options don't chance your mind in the Piazza, its a sweet place to try.",

    "text": "Yummmm. This place has really good bang for your buck. I ordered the \"Gone Fishin\" crepe which has: hot smoked salmon, spring onions, lemon juice, black pepper mayonnaise and rocket. There was a lot of fresh, flavorful salmon in the crepe and the flavors went really well together. The total came to 5.85 pounds so it's a reasonable dinner if you're in Covent Garden. The place is pretty cute with a tarvern-like feel and cute/chic decor. However, they also have outdoor seating and music playing outside which is really nice on a hot day.The only thing is, the portion is pretty small (at least compared to American sizes) so if you're really hungry, maybe order a side from one of the cute restaurants nearby. I really want to try the banana nutella crepe here and the Nick the Greek (Falafel, hummus, tsatziki, sunblushed tomatoes, red onion, black olives, extra virgin olive oil, oregano, fresh lemon juice, rocket for 5.75 pounds).Definitely recommend this place, and grab a macaron from nearby Laduree if you're in the mood for a small but delicious dessert!",
