Along with that the sushi roll was rolled up really tight that the sushi rice pasted like, not fluffy and easy to chew upon. If I had known from the beginning how the omakase was served no matter where I sat I would probably not bothered coming in. Good sushi is judged not by the creativeness of the piece but also by temperature and quality of the rice combination too.",

Yashin is about delicious, meticulously-prepared, beautifully-presented Japanese food, in a very nice and warm decor. We had dinner at the counter and would really recommend it, especially for a party of 2 or 3. We liked everything (apart from the Tofu but that's more personal). You get to see the chefs work and prepare the food, an entertaining and interesting show. It is not cheap but if you stick to beer or green tea it helps, especially as the food is the main attraction. We did have some wine and had some great advice from the Japanese sommelier who knew his French wines extremely well. Overall a great venue in an unlikely location. We will be back!",

    "text": "Recently opened Yashin Sushi near High Street Kensington is easy to miss if you don't know that it's there. Hidden away on a side street without any sign outside all you can go by is the interior and the large neon sign on the wall behind the chefs. The sign incidentally says \"Without soy sauce\" - the only soy sauce is the one that the chef has added to the sushi by brushing them with it to make sure it's the right amount. Let me say right now, the place is expensive. Since they recently opened when I went they were handing out vouchers for \u00a310 off per person for dinner. Still, the Omakase 8 (8 pieces of sushi with 6 rolls) is \u00a320 with the discount. The quality of the fish however is fantastic... I have to say this is the best sushi that I have had in London so far. Also, as you can expect from a place like this the service is impeccable. The seats are all situated around the counter behind which the chefs prepare the food. It's quite a sight sitting there watching the chef use a blow torch to quickly sear the scallop sushi you are just about to have. As an appetiser a plate with three different things were brought out of which I had to choose one. Why I couldn't have all 3 (especially since the place was deserted) I don't know.For a starter I tried the fresh tofu which comes some jelly that is supposed to be dissolved in the tofu. The tofu was silky smooth and quite nice with some very subtle flavours.On to the sushi. I went for the Omakase 8 and wasn't disappointed. There wasn't a single one that I didn't like and some were absolutely great. Melt-in-your-mouth fish quality and eat-slowly-to-savour-it flavours.After the sushi on to dessert. They had 4 different ice creams: green tea, white sesame, shiso sorbet and yuzu sorbet. I tried both shiso and yuzu sorbets and they were a fantastic ending to a great dinner. Very refreshing and light. I would come here all the time if it weren't for the price which is why I took one star off.",

    "text": "It was a girl's night out, to be filled with good food, alcohol and laughter. As most of us are foodies at heart, it didn't take long to decide on Yashin. I was really looking forward to it after a tough week and it was a great way to start the weekend. Funnily enough my friend and I were late and it didn't help that we both went to the wrong Kensington station. So the poor girls who were already waiting had to wait a little longer for us to arrive. Sorry ladies!We finally arrived and placed our orders. Some of us went for The Yashin at \u00a360 and the rest went for Omakase 11 at \u00a345. We were served some amuse bouche next. There was bite sized octopus and pork skin jelly with the third being omelette topped with shrimp.We also ordered some oysters to start. Fresh oysters and the vinegar dressing was definitely refreshing and added a zing! Yose Tofu \u00a36.20This was quite fun. The soy milk came in an earthen bowl and we were required to scoop the fish stock jelly which is dashi stock into the soy milk. This made me remembered a scene in Heston's 70s feast which I watched on telly last night where he did a similar version. The heat emanating from the soy milk melted the dashi jelly which trickled into the milk. Taste wise, it was a tad bland and nothing exciting. \u00a0I was expecting an umami hit!Next to arrive were the main stars. Omakase Eleven \u00a345 for 11 piece ensemble plus a roll of the day'The Yashin' \u00a360 for 15 pieces of exquisite sushiIt was a mix of some amazing ones and forgettable ones. The outstanding ones were the salmon with dashi stock, prawn sushi and yellow fin tuna. Sadly while the wagyu beef was good, there are better ones out there. There is no doubt on the quality and taste. Yashin makes fantastic sushi and easily one of the best to be had in London. Unfortunately, you pay for it with the price. The girls who had the Yashin felt that they could have stuck to the Omakase 11 as it included the fantastic ones as well. To have to pay an additional \u00a315 for an extra four pieces of while good but forgettable sushi was perhaps not of good value. When you've had sushi as good as or even better than this at a fraction of the price in Japan, I am happy to save and head on a Japan trip again.",

    "text": "Yashin is everything that is wrong with contemporary sushi establishments. Sushi should be a celebration of the fish, not an excuse to use the fish as a foil in order to use more overpowering ingredients. The ways in which the taste combinations failed miserably were plenty in Yashin however the key offenders were combining the fish with truffle oil, parmesan, and also sun dried tomatoes. These are not taste combinations that work and merely left a rank taste in my mouth. I don't mind experimental food if the taste combinations work, but these did not. Yashin also falls flat by subjecting some of the sushi to a flame. If served directly to the diner this can work, such as at Kikuchi where they do a great seared fatty tuna sushi. Searing the fish then allowing it to sit whilst the rest of the sushi plate is assembled (as they do at Yashin) means it arrives at the diner all cold and crusty...I should have known I was in for a bad time when I entered Yashin as the interior design is more akin to a Laurence Llewelyn Bowen interior design experiment than a trustworthy sushi establishment. Serving miso soup in quaint english chinaware is gimmicky.Maybe we came on a bad day as everyone else seems to love the joint but I will not be experiencing \"the yashin\" omakase again.",

If you've got some cash and are looking for an extremely memorable and fancy plate of fish, this is a great spot.This is a new spot opened by two chefs who decided to splash out on their own. The name of the restaurant comes from a combination of their names. The best way to go here is one of their 3 omakase (tasting) menus, which range from about 30-60 pounds. You'll get to sample 10-20 different types of fish, depending on how big of a menu you've selected. Each piece of nigiri is expertly and individually crafted and comes with its own garnish. The fish is very good quality and delicious. You're meant to enjoy the fish, not drown it in soy sauce and wasabi, hence their motto of \"without soy sauce.\" And their fish can definitely stand up to this closer examination. You're likely to exclaim, \"Wow, this is the best halibut/salmon/i-don't-know-what I've ever had!\"And after you've stuffed yourself with fish, they offer some interesting ice creams and sorbets, which come with fruit and gelee.What's almost as fun as eating the fish is watching it being prepared by some clearly expert chefs. Be sure to call ahead for reservations during the weekend, and get a seat at the sushi bar.I will be back.Gluten-free notes: Their motto is \"without soy sauce\" so you won't feel out of place skipping the soy sauce (which often contains wheat). Some of the pieces of nigiri seem to have some sort of sauce applied to them, so you'll want to ask.",

The tables are downstairs (which is slightly misleading when you first look inside because it seems as if you can only sit on a stool.) Downstairs it's comfortable, and the menu is fantastic. It's pricey [for someone coming from the states!], but not over the top. Practically all the dishes of sashimi or nigiri or rolls don't have or need soy sauce. DO NOT give in to the temptation to ask for soy sauce. Each item was seasoned just right. You do not need the soy sauce, trust me. If you want to drown your food in soy sauce, you should leave the restaurant and go somewhere else so that you can spend less money on unpalatable sashimi. Truly the best Japanese food that I've had since Nobu.I'll post photos soon, but... don't go to their website. It will constantly crash your browser!",

As most of us are foodies at heart, it didn't take long to decide on Yashin. I was really looking forward to it after a tough week and it was a great way to start the weekend. Funnily enough my friend and I were late and it didn't help that we both went to the wrong Kensington station. So the poor girls who were already waiting had to wait a little longer for us to arrive. Sorry ladies! We finally arrived and placed our orders. Some of us went for The Yashin at \u00a360 and the rest went for Omakase 11 at \u00a345. We were served some amuse bouche next. There was bite sized octopus and pork skin jelly with the third being omelette topped with shrimp. We also ordered some oysters to start. Fresh oysters and the vinegar dressing was definitely refreshing and added a zing! Yose Tofu \u00a36.20This was quite fun. The soy milk came in an earthen bowl and we were required to scoop the fish stock jelly which is dashi stock into the soy milk. This made me remembered a scene in Heston's 70s feast which I watched on telly last night where he did a similar version. The heat emanating from the soy milk melted the dashi jelly which trickled into the milk. Taste wise, it was a tad bland and nothing exciting. I was expecting an umami hit! Next to arrive were the main stars. Omakase Eleven \u00a345 for 11 piece ensemble plus a roll of the day 'The Yashin' \u00a360 for 15 pieces of exquisite sushi It was a mix of some amazing ones and forgettable ones. The outstanding ones were the salmon with dashi stock, prawn sushi and yellow fin tuna. Sadly while the wagyu beef was good, there are better ones out there. There is no doubt on the quality and taste. Yashin makes fantastic sushi and easily one of the best to be had in London. Unfortunately, you pay for it with the price. The girls who had the Yashin felt that they could have stuck to the Omakase 11 as it included the fantastic ones as well. To have to pay an additional \u00a315 for an extra four pieces of while good but forgettable sushi was perhaps not of good value. When you've had sushi as good as or even better than this at a fraction of the price in Japan, I am happy to save and head on a Japan trip again.",

The only draw back to the place as with most places in London it can attract the pretentious douchey crowd who are loud obnoxious euro-trash. However the food and staff make it a pleasurable experience\u00a1",

We looked at the menu and all almost had a heart attack. We legit only got one meal and split it between the three of us. With 2 glasses of champagne we still ended up spending \u00a3150. WAY OVER PRICED and really not much food. Also, for the money you would expect the service to be better. The host was so snooty and our server was not helpful at all. We were his only table and you would think he didn't want our money. I spilled my glass of almost full champagne and they didn't help clean or replace it. Yes it was my fault but I am at a supposedly fine dining restaurant you would think they would be more attentive. Definitely wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Yashin has a system which is apparent when sitting at the bar. There is the head chef who slices the fish and his second in command that prepares and presents it. Lots of other staff who busily take drink orders, stock the bar and make sure the restaurant works like a well oiled machine.Having tried the Yashin platter which allowed me to sample many lovely bites, this is the way to go. The selection changes frequently so it's a take on the omakase although presented all at once, which can either make for quick consumption or choose your own adventure.What fell short for me was the order. Generally omakase takes you on a journey, where you are able to enjoy each selection as an accompaniment to the next. Yashin staff provide no guidance except to eat in any order, thus losing a bit of the magic.The majority of the nigiri was well made, each having its own flavour, no extra soy sauce needed, as the sign suggests. Service was high quality, so you will get what you want when you want it. There is a good sake selection to enjoy as well.Yashin has an intimate feel, even for tables that host large groups. It's recommended to book ahead as it can get quite busy. Don't come expecting your traditional sushi but if you're looking for a hip, upscale place then this is your spot.",

    "text": "It's great to see Britain gradually lose its status as the poor food appreciators of the world and one of the proofs is the proliferation of sushi eaters. Even 10 years ago, the thought of eating raw fish would be anathema to most Brits but now, you can buy it in supermarketsHowever, the quality is still way behind places like California, where simple mom and pop places still turn out amazing and affordable sushiYashin is a higher end restaurant and I got the chance to try it out for lunch yesterday. The staff are super nice and shout out a Japanese greeting as you enter, Ippudo style. At least, I assume it's a greeting!I had made a booking via their website and the only seating oddity is that they like to cram everyone to one end of the kitchen counter even though there was lots of space available. I didn't mind but a couple who came in after me asked to sit at the empty endAs I had turned up for sushi, I opted for the omakase 8 for \u00a330 - 8 pieces of nigiri sushi with the choice of fish dictated by the chefs as well as 6 pieces of maki roll of the day, served with miso soup in a teacup and saladI'm always up for miso soup but I found the salad a little bland, mainly because the dressing was uni-dimensional rather than having a few balanced flavoursNow onto the sushi. Firstly an apology for the lack of photos but I have to confess I forgot in my excitement to eat it! The pieces aren't huge and those with a bigger appetite than I may still feel a little peckish on leaving. However, the quality of fish is first rate. They were conventional fish though and I was hoping for something a little more off the grid or the odd bit of luxury like toro (fatty tuna belly) or scallopThe restaurant's USP is 'without soya sauce' and they season the sushi and every piece had a matching condiment on top. I presume that's because they want you to really taste the fish and this is where I think some of their condiments were too powerful - there was especially a wasabi based one that made it impossible to taste that piece properly. I ended up nibbling each of the nigiri on is own to get the flavour of the fish before eating it with the condimentI did enjoy the sushi but having eaten at places like Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, my advice is less is more when it comes to adding flavours sushi. In fact, I loved the crab salad maki roll because I could taste and enjoy the crab flavourAt these prices, a visit here is more of a treat than an everyday meal but my favourite nigiri in London still remains otoro at Dozo in Soho and hotate (scallop) at Cocoro",

Each fish was seasoned differently and the fish was excellent quality- the mackerel in particular was exceptionally fresh. For \u00a325 this was a pretty good deal!We also got an order of the 'summer truffle toro with salted kombu'. The truffle and toro was delicious- there were whole pieces of truffle which was a real treat for the palate! There were 5 pieces of toro which was a very reasonable portion for such a high quality dish. We ordered the Sukiyaki with red ginger roll as it said it came with a raw egg and we were intrigued.. The roll was really crispy and could be dipped into the raw egg served separately. We thoroughly enjoyed it- the egg gave it a creamy flavour and the variety of textures worked really well.The decor of the restaurant has been really well thought out and the servers were very attentive. We will be back for sure!",

Whilst parts of the 15 piece \"Yashin\" selection were excellent I was disappointed in the fact that all pieces were prepared in advance and then served as a group. As many pieces are lightly cooked with a butane torch, once they have been left sitting for 10 minutes, what was originally soft and succulent fish becomes rubbery and much less tasty! The raw fish was obviously very high quality however at times the garnish accompaniments were overwhelming to the flavour of the fish.The service was acceptable but at this price point one reserves the right to be picky and to be honest nothing makes up for a server with a clear understandable accent. Altogether not poor but at this level leaves much to be desired.",

Save up and try this, totes worth the hype.",

    "text": "Thank god it was on the company dime! Going here is like is tasting fine wine. Its subtle in taste, rich to those who know better and what to look for and its super duper expensive if you don't watch the amount of booze you have. The sushi is prepared seasoned so no soy sauce and no ginger for YOU! There is a piece of ginger that you're supposed to nibble on between bites as a palate cleanser. The sushi was pretty amazing, tasted fresh and had some subtle hints of flavor that did not distract from the fish. You can taste the level of skill and thought that was put into these nigiri pieces. My pal and I had 2 bottles of 300ml sake, a beer, 2 of the \u00a330 rolls with edamame. Holy cow was it expensive. \u00a3171 without the service charge. Definitely worth going to, but I wouldn't make it habit forming.",

I came in for lunch and watched the chefs do what they do best. This place is pricey but you can even find great affordable options whether it be a \u00a312.50 sushi lunch special or \u00a320 omakase for dinner. Highly recommend going here and who knows maybe I'll see you there.",

And we had a great experience here. \u00a0The standout was toro with a thinly sliced truffle on top. \u00a0The real deal. Another amazing dish was the the beef and something cut roll (forgot the name). In the center of this was a raw quail egg that you break and dip your pieces in. Loved it! \u00a0The next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll stop by again!",

    "text": "I wanna start by saying that I'm a bit snobby when it comes to sushi. and that I thought sushi in London is hopeless and subpar. cos nobody knows what good quality seafood means or even tastes like... until I found Yashin.I'm addicted to Yashin. It's like a drug. I can't stop thinking about it, and when I have it, I keep wanting more. Seriously, my order increases every time I go. Makes me feel like an insatiable beast.So what's so special about Yashin? First off they've got really good quality fish. Probably the best I've had in London (better than Nobu IMO). It's rare that you find good quality uni and hotate here, but Yashin's got it!! In terms of otoro, chutoro and fatty salmon, they are OK. They're not bad but I wouldn't say they're outstanding. I normally prefer my sashimi cut a bit thicker, but I guess otoro/chutoro/fatty salmon are hard to source so it's more precious for them. Now let's talk about their special sauce and toppings. They're AWESOME. They even make boring sea bass amazing, and change my view on my least favorite mackerel. Their tuna carpaccio \u00a0with truffle sauce and yuzu sauce is a little taste of heaven. It's a great starter while you're waiting for your nigiris (they could take a while)If you're into sake they have a very well selected list of junmai, jinjo and daijinjo. writing this review makes me want more Yashin!",
