You're given a bowl of not-too-greasy prawn chips to start while you wait, but the soup comes out surprisingly quickly after ordering - perhaps because its just a matter of assembling the ingredients: The beef was really tender, just the right amount of noodles (usually I have so many left over), broth was complex and not overly salty. All the regular fixins (sprouts, basil, chili peppers and lime) are fresh. Don't forget to ask for a student discount!",

I think the fuzzy pictures of foreign cuisine makes people a little apprehensive. And we haven't talked about the descriptions... wha...?Anyhow, by divine providence, we settled on ordering different dishes to share, including some inspired tofu rice rolls (with peanut sauce - yum!), and mixed platters that featured sweet potato fries, battered calamari, and a mega-spicy cucumber salad that surprised everyone!Throw in some oyster sauce-d beef in a claypot served on a plate LIT ON FIRE?!

    "text": "What's the first thing you do when visiting a new city? Hope on Yelp and bookmark all the awesome-sounding restaurants nearby? Well, that's what I did, and I found Sen Viet!I visited here on Sunday night with a friend from Uni, who lives about 5 minutes down the road. He's been living in the UK for over 3 years and had never visited, so I was excited to see if this place lived up to the reviews online. It did! This is a casual, no frills kind of restaurant but we just wanted to catch up over food and beers, so it was perfect. He did the honourable thing of letting me order for us both (and he was happy with the result too, double bonus!). We shared some prawn and pork spring rolls, a crispy chicken pancake, a sizzling beef and garlic dish as well as lemongrass chicken. The stand out dish for me was the crispy chicken pancake - crispy, light but thick at the same time and gave an awesome crunch to the soft, delicate chicken thigh inside. Wrapped in a iceberg lettuce leaf added another dimension of crisp. This was absolutely perfect and I would return to this restaurant just to eat this dish. Our other dishes were really tasty as well, and we had some rice on the side. On a Sunday night it was easy enough to get a table and it had a good turnover of people popping in for food. The service was really friendly in a warm, authentic way. This isn't the kind of restaurant to linger long in after you've eaten, you'd be better off heading to a nearby bar for a drink. Overall, a fab night with some really great tastes of Vietnam that are hard to find in Glasgow.",

    "text": "The attitude of the waiter at the bar was surprisingly rude. We waited for 30 minutes and the water was not served. We asked the waiter at the bar for at least our drinks just because we were thirsty and he replied angrily that its going on by queue, while the table who came and ordered after us already received their foods and drinks on 5-10 minutes after they sat down. We also complained about how other tables got foods before us, the bar waiter got pissed off and said \"first come first serve\" out loud without listening to us that we WERE the ones who came first. Another 10 minutes went by without any drinks or foods, the waitress came to inform us that the summer roll that we ordered was finished..???!! That was the point where our limits were reached. My girlfriend asked for the bill immediately as we were getting upset. The funny thing was that the waitress (not the bar waiter) was the one saying sorry along with her manager i believed and brought us the summer roll..!! So..it was NOT actually finished. This was the worst vietnamese food experience we had ever had in London. Despite the fact that I am a pho lover and I always look for good vietnamese restaurants in London for Pho, I have to say this place is very disappointing and I suggest you go somewhere else. The place that has about the same level in terms of taste (pho) is Cafe VN (Clerkenwell Road) and Banh Mi Bay (Theobalds Road). But the best pho and the best vietnamese restaurant out of more than 30 restaurants we have tried is Cafe East London. It's around Canada water (far), but really worth going. If Sen Viet still has this kind of waiter who does not want to serve customers, then there is no need for us to be there for them to serve or you can find out for yourself. We might be just unlucky.Ps. Not to mention that he was speaking irresponsibly badly about us and what he did in Vietnamese thinking that we did not understand because we were speaking Englisn, but unfortunately I am half vietnamese, so I know everything they said. It was very very unpleasant to hear I have to say.",

Noodles were made on site so you didnt have to suffer theough that nasty plastic taste you get from low end places. The broth was the highlight. Full of flavor, and spice, not to salty. a really nice balance of flavors. The veggies were unusual not what im used too, but not bad. Crisp and fresh.

The fried egg rolls are meaty and fried to perfection. The fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork are also delicious. The pork thit nuong was delicious and seriously just the freshness I needed after overeating carbs and fat in Rome. Bottom line: go here. It's over priced, but it's so good!!!!Minus one star bc for dinner we didn't get shrimp chips like the other tables. Like, what gives? They were good shrimp chips too.",

Thankfully, that would not prove necessary. We ordered the ch gi\u00f2, shaking beef and a small bowl of spicy pho. We were delighted when the ch gi\u00f2 arrived with enough lettuce to wrap every last piece (that never seems to be the case.) The tender and savoury shaking beef came atop a bright salad. We got a side of steamed rice with it, which I'd do again. The pho was less impressive but the previous two dishes were good enough to return for.If ever there was a case for not judging a book by its cover, Sen Viet is it.",

The rolls are good-sized and had lots of flavour and I especially liked their new BBQ pork roll. I initially thought the pho was a bit small and there wasn't enough noodles (and also thought the texture was a bit too soft) but it really filled me up in the end. My friend also liked the pho, but she wasn't a big fan of the fried icecream, which tasted weird with the outing being not crunchy at all. So I suggest to stick to the Vietnamese classics here. The place was really hard for me to find, so maybe it's good to service was so quick.",

I stumbled upon it last night with my boyfriend, we'd wanted to go somewhere using the Tastecard but after seeing the menu here, and the 10% student discount, we decided to give it a try.The outside is misleadingly lackluster and the music is the typical mix of love songs and 90s chart hits. The staff are lovely, this is without a doubt the friendliest service I've ever had at a Vietnamese restaurant.We ordered crispy spring rolls to share, they came with lettuce for wrapping, some mint and an amazing nuoc cham dipping sauce. They were really, really, really good. The filling tasted of Vietnamese meatloaf and the wrapping was crispy and delicious. I ordered a large Pho with rare beef, and my boyfriend got a Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup). When the noodle soups came I was a little confused by the fixings that came with them, the beansprouts had been replaced by strips of lettuce (!!?!!?), which I've never seen before, but there were two leaves of sawtooth coriander and some mint, chillies and a wedge of lemon. The pho was decent (but I suspect, full of MSG), and the beef could have been fresher. My boyfriends Bun Bo Hue was flavourful, and a very satisfactory meal.At the end of the meal we were given two complimentary slices of orange, and a tiny cup of delicious tea each, which was a lovely touch. With a Tiger beer, a Fanta, 2 noodle soups and a starter the bill came to \u00a319 for both of us. I really hope Sen Viet keep it up, because I'll be back for the service (and the spring rolls) alone.",

    "text": "Wow. Just had dinner for the 1st time here (won't be the last!) and I can say I'll be returning soon and often. One of my work colleagues, who is Vietnamese, took a small group of us for dinner today (pay day!).I'd never been and love Vietnamese food so I decided to come along. Wow, am I glad I did! Except for the tofu summer rolls (good) which I shared as a starter, pretty much everything we ordered was new to me. The other starter was a beef baguette which was lovely (had a sneaky bite).Now onto the mains. We tried the stuffed aubergine which came with plenty of tofu and veg - wonderful. Healthy and very tasty. We also got a sort of fried crepe thing again stuffed with a mixed vegetable stir fry (but different from the aubergine). This actually came with lettuce wraps and mint and was hard to eat but absolutely delicious. Now onto the non veggie. We had this incredible beef, sorry i forgot the name but I took a picture. It was some sort of marinated, pan fried beef dish. It was so unbelievable tender and bursting with flavour. I would not come here again without ordering. To finish our savoury tasting, we got a seafood and rice vermicelli plate - not as mind blowing as the beef but still very good. At this point I was freaking out because discovering a restaurant this good and cheap near the office is not an everyday affair. And here comes the coup de grace. I never order dessert at Asian restaurants because, let's face it, it's often not their forte. However, everyone at the table was curious so we got the mango spring rolls and the deep fried ice cream. The mango spring rolls were very nice (if a bit sweet) but what I found great was the deep fried ice cream. Really good quality vanilla delicately coated in bread crumbs and sprinkled with peanuts & condensed milk. So tasty!! Needles to say, I'm a fan. I can't wait to have many a work lunch and post work dinners here. Final note is that it's VERY reasonable. With all that food and a couple of drinks we came to \u00a318/pp. Fantastic.",

The true star of the meal was the breaded prawn with the sweet and spicy jelly dip. Very delicious! \u00a0Expensive, but beautifully clean, and crisp shrimp that taste great on their own but simply pop with the chili jelly. Fair warning: there are no caffeine-free teas here.

Reviews are good, it's close by to the hotel we're staying in so here we are. The good side: We ordered the prawn and pork summer rolls for appetizer and it was amazing. Even better than the ones in LA! LA is known for great foods by the way. Fianc\u00e9 for the beef stew with jasmine rice. I didn't try it but he said it was pretty good. Service was great from the moment we walked in till the very end. The bad side: Why I took away 1 star is because for the portion of the chicken pho I ordered. It was almost like kids meal so I obviously didn't feel like I had a good meal afterwards which was a disappointment. Don't order any pho if you're more on the starving side. The rice plates portion looks decent.We'll probably come back again sometime during our trip, but no more pho from this place.",

(Bang Bang in Fitzrovia, I see you.) It's like if I had ordered pancakes and they gave me French toast instead, I could tolerate this. Maybe it's an access-to-ingredients issue? Maybe pancakes = French toast in this part of the world? Fine. But if I order pancakes and you place a slab of meat with tomato jam on the table, I'm calling your bluff.

    "text": "My friends and I were nearing the end of our Euro backpacking trip and was craving for some Asian food after all of the Danish/ British food we've been eating. We all ordered PHO, and it was sweeter than it normally is back home in LA. Just as delicious since it was raining in London. I recommend anyone who's a bit homesick for Asian food to check this restaurant out. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. ENJOY!",

Sold!We got prawn crackers to start with, everyone quickly found something on the (slightly too extensive) menu and waited to order. And waited to order. Aaaaaand waited to order. We had to get the attention of staff before we could order, but apart from this little snag, service was great! Food arrived fast and was very good. They were able to accommodate food sensitivities and allergies as well.We had a very enjoyable evening here.",

    "text": "With my high standards for Vietnamese food, I came to Sen Viet while in London on business. \u00a0It pleasantly surprised me!The menu is more elaborate than the typical pho place, but the food is actually good. The setting is also fancier than a typical Chinatown joint, so reserving is recommended as evenings do get busy.My partner and I got the BBQ pork fresh rolls to start \u00a35.50, then spicy soup with seafood and it was good (\u00a310.90). We also had the classic rare beef soup - also good (\u00a39.90). We were very satisfied for a total of \u00a326.00.Sen Viet accepts cash and cards, they have some typical beverages, desserts, and friendly staff. The restaurant can be suitable for couples and groups, \u00a0it be aware that like in other Asian places, you can be seated with other people of the place is packed. Enjoy!",

And they brought us extra shrimp crackers!Definitely tasty, definitely worth the money. 7.30\u00a3 for a beef and veggie stirfry with vermicelli (I misspelt that) and 3\u00a3 for a Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk.",

    "text": "Sen Viet is a decent-sized friendly restaurant a few minutes walk away from St Pancras. It has a very large menu with options varying from the safe to the unusual.We opted for a sharing platter to start. Everything on here was good and tasty. It was good value too as there were quite a few varieties available. Particularly liked the chargrilled squid.Mains were a catfish claypot which was flavourful and not too spicy and a soy beef dish which was recommended to me. I never would have picked this dish without prompting so it was good to ask for the waiter's opinion. Soft fillet of beef, salty soy marinade and salad was different and delicious. Service is friendly, smiling and not too intrusive. I would definitely go back if I was in the area.",

Highlights included chargrilled prawns with sweet chili sauce, great summer rolls, the same excellent spring rolls as last time and shaking beef salad which was tender and flavourful. Mains of crispy chicken salad (see pic) and sizzling seafood were equally good with a side of pak choi and garlic. The service is excellent and prompt and the prices are very reasonable. My favourite Vietnamese in London.",

    "text": "Thank you once again for providing me with a great restaurant recommendation. A large group of us dined here on Saturday night. Outside it was wet, cold and miserable but we soon forgot about that once we stepped through the front door.We were dressed in 1920s attire ready for the night that was to come later (see my next review) but were excited to see what Sen Viet had to fill our tummies.A word of warning... the menu is very confusing. I wish I could rework it for them. They have a lot of different dishes, but headings for 'Starters', 'Main Courses' etc. are nestled among the dishes in the same small print. Please do persevere though because there's plenty on offer and it isn't limited to the usual Pho and Bun you see elsewhere. They have excellent and enticing descriptions and occasional photos to help you choose.The only criticism for the restaurant was the service which was very slow. We kept making eye contact to have our order taken but eventually had to go to the front desk to ask. Food however was delivered promptly so perhaps I'm just too British and need to be more forward.My friends and I shared a portion of Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls between us just so we could get a taste. There were lots of good 'mmm' sounds as we dipped our Summer rolls into the sticky dipping sauce and I couldn't resist having a second portion of Summer Roll that my friend didn't fancy trying (more fool her). We also shared portions of steamed rice, pak choi and noodles with beansprouts between the group.For my main I ordered an intriguing dish called Campfire Steak. I never could have prepared myself for the spectacle that arrived before me. Check out the picture. They set fire to my plate! It looked awesome, but the flames did take a while to die down and I was a bit nervous picking my first few bites out of the bowl using chopsticks. The flavour was beautiful though so I'd highly recommend giving it a go.The meal cost about \u00a318 each which included wine too.",
