    "text": "The food was good at eat Tokyo but the service was terrible. I have had equally good Japanese food elsewhere but with much better service so I just can't recommend this place. We reserved a table for a Wednesday evening at 730 and my friend arrived just beforehand. The staff wouldn't let her sit at our table until the other two of us arrived (even though it was free) but told her to wait outside. Why take bookings if you leave people waiting outside like those without? When I arrived they did then allow us to our table because we insisted whilst we waited for our last friend. No waiter came to us for 30mins, not even to offer a drink. Eventually I had to get their attention to order. The waiter was confused and didn't seem to understand our order which not not complicated. When the food did come (which took a long time) one of the starters was forgotten. It then arrived with the mains and we had to ask to send it back. At this point I complained about the service and we didn't get an apology just the excuse they were busy. Then as we were finishing eating around 9, the waiter came and told us we had to leave because they had another reservation. I told him that we were now being rushed because of their slow service, he seemed disinterested. When it came to the end we didn't pay service (which I've never done before) and I decided to explain why- again no real apology and complete disinterest in terms of finding out why we were unhappy. Not going back!",

On the down side was the 30 minute wait for a table and 5 of us (3 of whom were strangers) being squashed onto a table for 4 people. \u00a0I don't envy the floor manager's job though so I think he did a good job under tough circumstances and we were asked if we would be happy to share with the others no one forced it upon us. \u00a0The waiting staff were lovely and helpful and no one hurried us to leave even with the large queue outside. The tuna bento box was delicious and so were the prawn rolls. The plum wine was nice but I've definitely had better (and cheaper) elsewhere. Overall it was a good experience with great food and friendly table mates.",

Mmmm.Good size portions, and well priced. I had a bento box and my friendless friend, chirashi. The sashimi was wonderful and I saw a brave couple attacking the sashimi boat which looked massive. They finished it as well; impressed.Now, I didnt have any actual rolls but the spicy salmon rolls and crispy rolls looked soooo good; the variety/choice is pretty spectacular too I'm going to have to come back and try them out with a bigger group.I'll be back!",

All for mostly sushi (I'd rather have it cut down so I'm not suspicious of how fresh it will be). Saying that the sushi was not bad. The Unagi was the real star. A regular portion is more than enough. No need to go large. The Prawn tempura was also fresh, crispy and good portion. Just think they need to cut down as it's a bit confusing having so much choice.",

The place is a little bit cramped and the service is a little bit slow, but these are \u00a0easily forgiven when you are met by smiling staff who greet you with \"konnichiwa\" on the way in and \"arigato\" on the way out. The menu is extensive - simple sushi, fancy sushi, bento box, soups, rice dishes, snacks, and more. This particular visit I had the rice box with steamed egg and chicken, plus a few gyoza shared with my friend. \u00a0Absolutely delicious and very filling, costing only just over a tenner with green tea. Although the restaurant is fairly big, with three floors of tables packed next to each other, it is hugely popular and bookings are highly recommended.",

I had the katsu jyu. The katsu jyu was a lot of food for 9.50. Two chicken katsu cutlets with an egg sauce poured on, this was all on a good serving of rice.

The first time I came here, I was literally running out the door still chewing my food as I left. The second time, nearly 30 minutes went by after ordering and I had to get my food wrapped up for take-away. Plus side is that they have a good number of servers running around, but clearly not enough kitchen staff to efficiently accommodate for the lunch rush. In short, good food, large menu, but don't come here if you're in a hurry.",

I could have eaten it over two meals, which is maybe why they intend you to sit and have a leisurely lunch. The food was all delicious too, flavorful and fresh. Their menu is extensive, arduously so, if you're not sure what you feel like having any given day. That being said, they have food for a huge range of budgets, because you can order as expensive or as inexpensive a dish as you like. I got the impression, though I don't eat sushi a lot, that their sushi might be pretty standard prices for like, Soho, but seemed a bit expensive for the portion sizes in the Holborn area. I know those neighborhoods are right next to one another, but on a back street near the city, it just feels like a different place, you know?All in all, a good place for Japanese. I'd recommend it for sure, just make sure you have time to enjoy it!",

They have a huge menu so you can choose from sushi, rolls, donburi, fish, curry, tempura and multiple bento boxes.I had the mixed tempura which included two prawns, one fish and a variety of vegetables. The box also came with two maki rolls, agedashi tofu, salad and rice with a side miso soup. All this for \u00a311!It's a small space even with upstairs seating. Service is decent and relatively quick. A good meal in a casual environment.",

    "text": "Buckle in folks. This one's a good read. I went there with my girlfriend as it had previously been her go-to sushi restaurant. We hadn't quite had time to decide on what to order before the server came up to take our order. I knew what I wanted so I ordered crispy tuna (described on the menu as spicy tuna with fried bits) and tuna avocado and a couple of other rolls to share. My girlfriend was a little less decisive and although it had been maybe 10 seconds of waiting the server rudely walked away and proceeded to not come back to our table until we had to call her to get tap water which wasn't available for the first ten minutes of our sit down. When she comes back with the water she slammed it down on our table haphazardly and gives my girlfriend angry stares from then on. My gf acknowledges to me how uncomfortable this is making her but it seems we get a different server from then on. Anyway, when we get our food we naturally start tasting each one together to compare the rolls and determine which ones are our favorites. We both try a piece of every roll (and they all have 6 pieces-pretty standard). When we try the crispy tuna we are both presented with a practically inedible piece of warm dry tuna fish. No spice, no crunch, literally just warm dry tuna fish. Easily one of the most awful dishes I've ever eaten. And to top it off the dish was a staggering 5.5 quid for an inedible roll. I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to send it back and get something else but she was so uncomfortable by our server's previously hostile actions towards her that she told me to let it go and not worry. At the end of the meal I went to pay leaving the horrid tuna fish roll on the plate and told the cashier about our experience. She looked completely uninterested and asked what she wanted me to do. I asked her if she could not charge us for the roll we didn't eat and I would happily pay for the rolls we did. Well this clearly struck a nerve as she REFUSED to budge blaming me for not sending it back even when I had told her about the poor treatment my girlfriend received earlier. She claimed that we had eaten the entire roll (who doesn't at least bite the food that they ordered that they expected to be not just edible but good?) I explained that each of us trying a bite is not the equivalent of eating the whole roll and anyone who actually cares about their customers would understand that and be accommodating for the truly dismal experience they had. I eventually caved because of the back and forth arguing (which I never intended to argue. I had simply wanted to be treated with basic human decency) and paid the entire STAGGERING price of this horribly mediocre sushi. Overall, the experience that I had at this restaurant shows that they do not care about their customers. They want you to enjoy their poorly prepared product in silence, pay the exorbitantly gross price that they overcharge for weak-quality food, and then leave in silence. I hope this review is helpful in getting people to not share the same disappointing and demoralizing experience I had at this restaurant.",

There is even the option on the menu to go large for all you big eaters who complain about portion size. There is plenty of variety here, so much to choose from and its amazing how they keep up. Not just sushi, there is other quality Japanese food, and the drink menu to match. The restaurant is cosy, and make use of the space they have. It gets really busy, and been advised its always good to book. The service is decent, but given how busy it gets, understandable. \u00a0There is a chain of them, and with so many Japanese resturant popping all over London in the last decade, it can be difficult to choose one which is consistent, and reasonably priced. Therefore with this, Tokyo Eat is new favourite go to.",

It was nice and crispy served with a light sauce. The only sashimi I liked was the salmon. I felt the other pieces were very fishy, which gives me the impression that it is not fresh. The ramen was average, the broth was tasty, the egg was almost perfectly cooked but there wasn't much else to it. Overall it was a good portion but all the aspects of it was just average. The service is very friendly. The ambience is alright, it was a very tight fit, I felt like I was sitting at a communal table, which is alright. Okay for small groups but I wouldn't recommend for a date night or large parties. The location is easily accessible, but not good for handicaps. The pricing is fair. I wouldn't mind coming back but it isn't something I would highly recommend or crave for. To me this place is just a so so restaurant that I would go to if I'm tired and don't want to cook home.",

The restaurant itself isn't anything special, and when you head into the basement you're cut off from the rest of the world. You're totally reliant on the servers, who are unfriendly but helpful.

The staff are a little brusque and there's a fair amount of churn at this restaurant, but that's a-ok with me. The menu is massive and most items have accompanying photos (LOVE) and the pages are laminated like a massive delicious binder that I had for 9th grade Biology. But this is more delicious, of course. I went with my Ma, who is not a big fan of sushi. She was trying to \"eat outside the box\" but I MADE HER EAT IN THE BOX INSTEAD. A BENTO BOX THAT IS! HAHAHAHA.It was great value with 9 GBP hooking my great Mom up with some miso soup, a crisp green salad, chicken teriyaki, sesame seed-studded rice, 2 cucumber maki and 4 cubes of tofu. Perfect. /have I had too much sake? This review makes me sound whack.Not whack though?The sushi rolls. Special love for the crispy spicy tuna, the delicious salmon skin and, well...most of the rolls, actually. The rice is perfect, the fillings/fish are plentiful, and I think they're great value for (London) money. The sides are also amazing; there are some new dimsum-y offerings (dumplings, siu mai) but I stick to wakame and nasi goreng, which are both done perfectly. I rarely get dessert post-sushi but here I've had both mango and green tea mochi and strongly, strongly recommend the former. Filled with a creamy puree-based ice-cream it's tart and smooth and creamy. Such a great end to the meal.Yelp note: it gets crazy busy round peak times, but don't be dissuaded as the turn-over is fast (especially if you're a small group of 2 or 3).",

    "text": "A Japanese colleague recommended Eat Tokyo to me quite a while ago, didn't have the chance until recently. We got there around 8pm on Friday. The restaurant was packed, there were a couple waiting before us, but after 5 mins there were already over 10 people stood behind us! The restaurant didn't have any sign asking customers to queue outside, there were people just stormed into the restaurant and waited inside even though there was a queue outside. Luckily after a while the manager told them all to queue. I know they are very busy, but it will be better if they can keep an eye on the queuing situation (Because there was quite a few people just ignoring the queue). One more thing, getting there early and doesn't mean will be seated earlier, it's totally depends on the amount of people. There were 3 of us, it took a while to get us a table. The restaurant itself isn't very spacious, which has a ground floor, a room in the basement and one upper floor. It can be quite crammed when full. The selection of the food was good, the price was good too. I ordered a Chirashi-Don (sashimi on sushi rice bowl), it came with miso soup. It was very good, it was a bowl of fresh assorted sashimi, very generous portion in my opinion. All these was under \u00a310! A friend ordered the Chicken Jyu (Chicken Teriyake over rice with miso soup), I tried some and it was lovely. I am still thinking about the food, and thinking when am I gonna go again. With such quality of food and reasonable price. No wonder it's so busy.",
