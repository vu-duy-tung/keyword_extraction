Our server Alain was attentive but non-intrusive.If you love vegetables, are willing to taste the innovative use of spices and small plates to share, then head to NOPI; if you're a meat and potatoes kind of person and the only vegetable you commonly see is parsley, then head somewhere else.",

Last time we were in London we ate in Ottolenghi's in Islington - this new location didn't disappoint at all.The decor is white and gold, yet manages not to look either too brashy or too sterile; quite a trick when the whole restaurant is white glazed tiles.We love Ottolenghi's food, so we knew we were in for a treat, but even-so the Shakshuka was an absolute delight; the best of eggs, so many subtle flavours and spices, and the creamy-yet-subtle smoked labneh... anticipation turned to contented bliss as I tasted the first bite - a real experience.Nopi also feature a bar, and we had to try it out! 2 non-alcoholic cocktails and a good long chat with the bar manager and also the restaurant manager Basia; the passion that all the staff have for food is very apparent.Next time we're in London, Nopi is number-one on our list to return to; a new favourite.",

    "text": "I've had Nopi on my list of places since it's another Ottolenghi restaurant..The menu is starter size portions, similar to the evening menu at Ottolenghi. I think the highlight for me is the vegetable dishes (as is the case at Ottolenghi). Delicious courgette fritters, excellent green beans with Chinese mushrooms and some grains, really special roasted aubergine with pickled cucumber and pumpkin seeds. We also sampled smoked eel, baby chicken with lemon myrtle salt and pork belly. \u00a0All were great with interesting taste and texture combinations with the exception of the pork belly which surprisingly was tough and plain in taste and we didn't finish. Kale and rainbow chard on the side was OK with garlic and vinegary dressing but not too exciting.Cocktails were good with some interesting ideas and just the right level of sour / bitter and importantly not sweet.The staff were wonderful, friendly, welcoming and attentive with good timing on the food and the atmosphere was just right. Slight buzz, chatty but amazingly not too loud at all given the reflective white tiled walls.Overall a great meal with one or two minor dips in greatness. The restaurant and staff were perfect but the food overall was not quite as special as Ottolenghi in Islington, in my humble opinion which surprised me but then maybe the slightly higher prices here and expectations were set too high so 4 stars overall.",

    "text": "Upscale Mediterranean FareVisit: October 8Prior to visiting London, I asked my friends for recommendations for eating in London and I got a very dismal response. Basically I was told that the fare in London was not good. Well phooey. London is a world-renowned city with a very diverse and demanding cultural scene so I knew there was good food to be had. Thanks to Yelp and all the Yelpers who contribute reviews, I found this restaurant. My husband and I enjoyed our best dinner at Nopi during our week visit to London. First of all, I was impressed with the d\u00e9cor. This space was obviously remodeled and felt very new. The color scheme is white...white walls, white table clothes, white marble floors. The marble had golden veins throughout, the gold coat hangers attached to the walls, and the brushed gold low-lit lanterns gave the room a nice warm glow. The only color came from a very incongruous painting on the back wall. In my amateur interior decorating opinion, the painting did not go with the theme or ambiance of the restaurant. The wait staff was dressed in severe black with white aprons and the room got its vibrancy from the patrons and the inventive cuisine that was served.My husband and I started with a sparkling wine: a Spanish rose (Cuv\u00e9e ros\u00e9 'Jeio', Bisol) for me and an Italian sparkler (Prosecco \"Garbel\", Adami) for Andy. We were both pleased with the wine. While we were enjoying our ap\u00e9ritif, we sampled the brown bread with olive oil. The olive oil was divine. It was obvious the oil was very fresh due to its very aromatic scent and wonderfully flavorful taste. The brown bread had a nice crust and a soft, light center that easily soaked up the delicious olive oil. We ordered 2 tapas and they arrived very quickly. The individual components of the roasted red pepper ensemble melded together delightfully and the sprinkle of the sharp and tangy goat cheese added a nice bite to the sweet and savory peppers. We never had burrata but we like mozzarella and several reviews highly recommended this Italian artisanal cheese so we decided to try it. Burrata is fresh mozzarella blended with cream giving the cheese enhanced creaminess and an airy, fluffy texture. It had little flavor but it paired extremely well with the slices of nectarine and the coriander seeds. Both of our sparkling wines accentuated the 2 tapas.We selected 2 more items for dinner: the mackerel and the rotolo, which we asked our waiter what rotolo was. He described it like a cannelloni. The rotolo was filled with spinach, butternut squash, and smoked ricotta surrounded with a pecan pesto. I thought the smoked ricotta was too smoky and overpowered the rest of the flavors but my husband really enjoyed it. The filet of mackerel was pan seared accompanied with a creamy sauce and a grape salsa topped with tobiko. The fish was tender and flakey with a light saltiness. The combination of the savory sauce and the subtly sweet grapes was unexpected and delicious. Andy ordered a glass of a French ros\u00e9 (Ch\u00e2teau La Coste, C\u00f4tes du Provence) and I picked out a white wine from France but our waiter said that was a bad choice. It's a good thing I'm not a wine snob or I would have taken offense but instead I asked him what he recommended to pair with the mackerel. He suggested a Gruner Veltliner (Huber, \"Ober Steigen\", Weingut). The bright and acidic Gruner paired exceptionally well with the mackerel and the creamy sauce.We received efficient service and the meal was well orchestrated at a leisurely pace. There were many vegetarian options and I liked the heartiness and creativity of the menu. The chef definitely put his own signature on the Mediterranean dishes. Overall: great wine, great food, and great service!",

    "text": "Yeah, I'm going to go there: I'm saying nope-y to NOPI.The tragic part is that it isn't the food that was a let-down, it was absolutely the staff. If you happen to follow my reviews, you'll know that I'm practically willing to permit bodily harm so long as the meal itself shines, but man, I have limits, too.Allow me to set the scene: three friends getting together for a Sunday brunch on a nice, late-summer day. We were the third table seated (I was a bit naive to think I needed reservations at that hour, fair enough) at 10:30am. We weren't allowed to choose a nicer table despite there being not a soul on that end of the restaurant, but alright, let's pretend everyone else got reservations, too.Menu? Very limited (we knew it'd be) but promising, with nice twists and classics side by side. The other gals went for breakfast sandwiches, I went for the shakshuka because friends, I cannot say no to shakshuka. It might be chronic at this point.Our tea arrived, we chatted, a couple more tables got seated.And we waited.Then we waited.We ordered more tea (three attempts at flagging down two separate servers before we succeeded), and 50min after sitting down, our food arrived, with only a slight delay between the sandwiches (which arrived first) and my eggs-in-tomato sauce dish, with no apology or acknowledgement from the server that it might be a little slow in coming. We joked lightly about how, you know, they'd clearly been curing the bacon and smoking my labneh back there all that time, but the food was quite nice. I can't say the bite I had of the breakfast sandwich was particularly earth-shattering, but it was certainly a nice interpretation of heart attack in a bun. I was a little disappointed with my shakshuka. I expected spice, and quite a bit of it, and got none. There were enough herbs and seasoning to keep it from being bland, but I kept hoping that I'd poke my way under a bit of tomato to uncover some heat. Alas.We decided to aim for gluttony and get pancakes to share three ways because YOLO at NOPI. (I'm sorry, I don't understand why the restaurant name is yelling at me.) It took about 10min to flag anyone down, we sipped our tea and... you guessed it. We waited. And waited.40min after ordering, the pancakes arrived. And hey, they were really tasty. At this point, the restaurant was getting more full and we were getting a little antsy; there's a point at which brunch becomes lunch, and we were starting to encroach on that.Then came the really fun part: trying to get our check.It took three servers and four attempts before we actually received it. We then couldn't find anyone to actually come by to take our money.When we were finally able to leave, we had been there just under three hours.Let that sink in.3 hours for two breakfast sandwiches, six cups of tea, and a stack of pancakes. In that time, I don't think I saw a single server make a welcoming, friendly, or warm facial expression.At the very least, you would think that the staff would want to turn over the tables more quickly to keep customers flowing, but apparently they're more interested in actively ignoring any and every polite attempt to make eye contact or establish a line of communication.Was the food good? Yes. Was it great? No. Is it worth going back? I wouldn't.",

Each dish was fresh and elegant, a fusion of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Asian flavours. If you are a fan of Yotam Ottelenghi, you will love his restaurant NOPI.

    "text": "What can I say about NOPI? It's simply put, one of the best meals I've had in my entire life.A few weeks before coming to spend a few days in London, my party of four booked reservations \u00a0to sit in the communal downstairs section of the restaurant. We planned our day for sight-seeing out to make sure we were a short walk away in time for our reservation. An easy walk 15 minute walk from Buckingham Palace, we were greeted at the restaurant by a friendly and pleasant staff. We sat at the end of a long table that can seat about 14-16 people. The table was quite tall and I usually find these uncomfortable, as tall chairs cut off circulation in my short chubby legs; however, these seats were perfectly comfortable. Our table neighbors were all friendly but respected that we were a group of friends having dinner together and kept conversation with us to a few polite interactions.I started my meal with a cocktail that was amazingly delicious: a Rooibos Old Fashion. Made with Fernet Branca and chocolate bitters, the bourbon and rooibos tea syrup blend so well that I could have had four of five of them and skipped dinner altogether. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their cocktails that night: one had a Ginseng & Grapefruit, another a Banana & Cardamom, and lastly, a Raspberry & Bourbon. All were a hit!We decided to have our dinner \"tapas\" small plate style and split everything between us. We shared Jicama & salsa, vegetable crudit\u00e9s, olives, burrata & blood orange salad, beetroot & goat's curd salad, cheese w/ peaches, and a Kale, Apple, and Turnip salad.When I say that all of these were amazing... my words do not do them justice. All were a revelation of how good properly prepared vegetables can be. Everyone agreed that we could have had a purely vegetarian meal and walked out delighted. My personal favorite was the beetroot and goat's curd salad - which I declared would be the last thing I tasted with the meal before dessert.We also ordered two mains to split between the four of us: the seared tuna and the rotolo. Both were phenomenal. The tuna was cooked perfectly and prepared in such a way that if you were to close your eyes you would believe you were eating a delicate cut of beef. The rotolo, made with spinach, mushrooms, and a walnut miso, was also just incredible. We all agreed that the mains would have been wonderful meals to have alone if we weren't in a sharing mood.Lastly, dessert (aka puddings) - We ordered three for us to share: I had chocolate with orange oil and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche... it was chocolate heaven with a sultry richness that should be illegal. We also ordered an apple gingerbread trifle with celery sorbet... I didn't try any because I was in a chocolate nirvana but more than one person raved over the celery sorbet. We also had a tau fu fa (a type of tofu pudding) that was also delicious!This was easily the best meal I've had in London and one of the best in my life. You can bet that whenever I am in London, I'll make sure I have a reservation for the downstairs at NOPI.",

It is this new kind of restaurant in London where you get a lot of small portions and share. The food is good, but all the meals we had (6people sharing, firsts, mains and sides) were missing that little something to be very good. Really nothing that would bring me back there.The coconut icecream at the end had too much lemon grass (not written on the menu) and tasted like soap. That was quite bad. Definitely not worth the price, that's for sure.",

    "text": "NOPI was a great dining and social experience. There were six of us, and the restaurant came highly recommended. For the most part, it did not disappoint. The menu was varied and fun, but overpriced. My \"twice cooked half chicken, lemon myrtle salt, chili sauce\" cost 22 Pounds; last night's feast at grungy chain restaurant Nando's of \"half chicken with Peri-Peri sauce\" was better, at 7 Pounds. Fancy chef, fancy prices. Nonetheless, NOPI offered two amazing things: bathrooms that were floor-to-ceiling mirrors straight out of the 70's, and a wonderful sensitivity to food allergies on behalf of one of our friends. In fact, our server was given a list of said allergies and soon returned with an updated menu that crossed out all dishes that contained the harmful ingredients. This level of service was indicative of the evening, including gentle reminders that our allotted dining time was ending in 18 minutes. We ignored them and ordered dessert instead. All in all, a fun spot worth a try.",

We opted for a variety of small plates and enjoyed them all. Normally, when ordering a variety of small plates the waiter asks how you would like the plates timing wise. Or they just evenly space it out with the heavier courses closer to the end.Unfortunately, we received all of our dishes at once which was a visual delight but was not optimal. Unless you want to inhale your food, the dishes get a bit cold as you nibble through. The twice cooked chicken was moist and flavourful with a lovely crisp skin. The courgette fritters were fragrant with herbs but but were a tad soggy. Polenta chips = yum, fluffy pillows fried to a crisp.",

We were advised to order 2-3 sharing plates each. We started off with courgette fritters with cardamom yoghurt, which were a stroke of culinary genious, grilled aubergine with lemon, nuts and pickled cucumber (equally delicious), and burrata with clementine and coriander seeds (another fantastic combination). We then had cod with pistachios and butter, which was cooked to perfection, and the twice-cooked chicken which was served with a spiced salt and hot sauce - seriously yummy!Although we were by this time exceedingly full, we just \u00a0could not pass on the tempting desserts on offer. We went for the peanut ice cream with chocolate sauce, and the chocolate ganache with creme fraiche and orange oil. Both were scrumptious, and the chocolate with orange oil was particularly inspiring.Alltogether, Nopi livded up to my high expectations, and I would definitely go again when opportunity presents itself!",

I loved the chickpea pancake, which was spicy and crisp.My meat-eating family also enjoyed the duck and the scallops.We shared two puddings. I am a true chocolate lover, and the I thought the baked ganache was good. The subtle addition of popping candy (\"Pop Rocks\" in the states, although I don't know whether this candy has a different name in the UK) was an interesting touch. However, the peanut butter and caramel ice cream with chocolate sauce and peanut brittle was definitely the star of the show, with the perfect combination of salty and sweet, creamy and crunchy.",

I have been to Ottolenghi and liked it so what is the deal? We shared a bunch of stuff, and the only stuff I recall tasty, and made me think \"wait this is something unique\" is the pork belly and a malt flavored ice cream for desert. We had the burrata, the sweet potatoes, the courgettes fried, the backed beans, the chicken, ... and nope nothing made me raise an eyebrow. I think I did not pick the right stuff. Big plus though: the place is super nice, especially the chef's table downstairs where we sat. Lights are perfect. Staff is nice, and this place has a real overall nice feel. The exact same feeling I had at Ottolenghi. So well, yes I need to check NOpi again.",

    "text": "An oasis of warmth and originality in Soho, Nopi is a classy, professional and adventurous restaurant.Despite my reservation not being in the system (possibly an open table issue), the host took it in his stride and found a table for me without an issue.Being led through the restaurant, the unique decor of all white tiles and brick, dimly lit through copper uplight fixtures, presented a mood one could describe as a sexy, sultry underground subway - if such a thing were to exist. Alas, on the music front, they went for boppy background shit when they could have completed the picture with some gritty blues/jazz reminiscent of an old blind African American busking guitarist in that same subway. \u00a0If not, the restaurant could have at least chosen something more original than dated Cafe Del Mar shit.I went for their spin on an old fashioned with Rooibos tea and chocolate bitters which was brilliant. The wine selection was equally brilliant - with some adventurous departures like a Sicilian Catarratto which is pretty unique (salty white wine!)... The Italian barbera (bandita cascina tavijn) was also pretty damn good, albeit traditional.Food wise, the cougette fritters were good, but nothing to write home about. The mullet I had to try, because as my father says - \"you can't make strawberry jam from pig shit\", but they managed admirably through a creative Indian stock with potatoes and mustard. The pork belly was an absolute standout - sweet pumpkin and a walnut Apple salsa worked perfectly!Staff were attentive and engaged, speed - a little rushed but not excessively and noise a nice balance of bustle with intimacy..Overall 4 stars - worth a visit and actually better value than I was expecting...Stop press... As I finish this review at their bar area (perfect for single diners) I am having a final cocktail - a Chilli Old Fashioned with Anejo, bloody delicious to finish!!!!I hope this helps your visit.

    "text": "One of the best meals of my life. Maybe even THE best. I was actually trying to make a reservation at a sister restaurant, Ottolenghi, and I was probably drinking too much wine or something and accidentally booked a table at NOPI instead. Happiest accident ever.About that reservation -- you'll want to make one -- especially if you're not from London and want to guarantee your seat. The upstairs is a bit more formal, and the downstairs is more casual, communal seating. And since I'm usually a hot mess when I'm traveling (or just in general), I decided the dark and cozy downstairs was right for me.No matter which part of the restaurant you're in, it's all beautiful. I love spots that are both upscale and casual at the same time. Everything was pristine, but nothing was fussy.Everyone at NOPI was incredibly friendly and genuinely helpful. Our server for the evening was a lovely young woman with a tight blonde pony and the sweetest disposition. She was subtly funny, and she took great care of us all evening. I never wanted for a thing. I have this wheat thing, and NOPI was stellar with helping me navigate around it. There were no questions or doubts -- only delicious food. In fact, NOPI is pretty darn spectacular with any type of allergy or dietary restriction. Almost everything our table ordered was vegetarian and gluten-free.For the full description of our dinner, check out Keith M's review. Since he went into so much detail, I'll skip that part. But I will tell you that I've never seen ingredients layered so well as NOPI did it. It's weird -- there were all these single items that I normally don't care for, but when combined with others, everything was absolutely perfect. For example, I don't care for fennel, but this warm peach, fennel, and soft cheese dish made even that vile weed taste delicious! Do yourself a favor and don't question or try to change anything -- just order it, and I promise you'll be a happy camper. If you're in (or headed to) London, NOPI should be at the top of your list!Pro tip: The owner and chef writes amazing cookbooks, and autographed copies are available at the front desk!",

The barstaff was on target, friendly and attentive to my food questions and requests- VERY unusual in Europe but also much appreciated for how much you are paying for the price here. I got the roasted aubergine w/ pecans, goat cheese and pomegranate seeds and roasted butternut squash with cardamom yoghurt, pumpkin seeds. My gosh, I dropped my fork for each first bite of each plate bc it was that delicious. I haven't had food this good since NYC. The rich flavors, texture and creamy natures all blended incredibly well. I left spending a small fortune but incredibly mouth-happy.

Limited menu however inventive ingredients which initially sound great. Server recommended 6-8 small dishes to share. We followed this rec however felt the dishes didn't agree with each other and competing spices (cayenne- lemon- coriander- bitter) just didn't work across. Overpowering seasoning in the aubergine mixed with an spiked lemon left a bitter taste for the meal. Crudit\u00e9s with avocado dip was simply garden carrots and radishes on a plate with mashed, spicey avocado. Burrata presented as a white ball with a drizzle of green sauce. It was ok. Nothing special. Scallops were highlight being super fresh. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant as I feel it's all hype and nothing special. Very lackluster. Actually 1st time I left a restaurant still being hungry. Overpriced too.",

Since we didn't have a reservation, they weren't sure if they could seat us but the hostess was so kind that she sat us at the bar while she looked over the night's reservations to see if they had space. While we waited, we enjoyed complimentary marinated olives, spiced nuts, and other snacks.They found us a small table and we were ready to eat! Trusting our Spanish waitress who'd work there for years, we allowed her to bring her favorite dishes to our table. She suggested the mackerel with coconut salad and peanuts, scallops with pork belly and apple, twice-cooked baby chicken with lemon salt and chili sauce, roasted aubergine with saffron yogurt and pickled chili, butternut squash, courgette and feta fritters with cardamom yogurt, and burrata with coriander seeds and white balsamic. Everything was boldly seasoned, expertly prepared, and meticulously plated. The quality of food was phenomenal. Along with the meal, we tried their ginger cocktails and mocktails. Although we were pretty full after our dinner, we couldn't not order a couple of sweet things. We had the chocolate cake with orange oil and creme fraiche, along with the caramel and roasted peanut ice cream, chocolate sauce, and peanut brittle. The peanut brittle reminded us of the rock candy from our childhood. It \"popped\" on our tongues when we ate it.The service was incredible and the food was divine.

I knew I had to come back.On my second visit I dined upstairs and my dining companion was 45 minutes late, which somehow didn't seem as awful as it sounds in the soft glow of the dining room.The third time ended up being the charm for me with NOPI, my dining companion on that visit said he'd give NOPI a sixth star if he could. And we've been back many times together since.Make sure to book a table at NOPI - I recommend reserving downstairs. It's communal, more casual and allows you to make new friends.Pay close attention to the vegetable options on the menu (even if you're a major meat masticator). I love the baby chicken (and you should order it) but I've always been blown away by the unique and super interesting vegetable preparations at NOPI- they can do magic with broccolini, beets, cauliflower and seemingly anything pulled from the ground.",

    "text": "The name Ottolenghi is synonymous with culinary rapture in my household, a status achieved through our home cooking of his sublime, complex dishes; our frequent ogling of his vivid cookbook photos; and our appreciation of the compelling personal stories and behind the scenes commentary accompanying many of his recipes. \u00a0 To say expectations were high going into my recent lunch at NOPI -- my first time in an Ottolenghi restaurant -- would be the understatement of the year. \u00a0The feast was sumptuous, beautiful, and memorable, and every single ingredient -- from the cuts of meat and stalks of vegetables to the subtle condiments and deftly sprinkled spices -- was purposeful and perfect. \u00a0Navigating the menu was impossible, like choosing from thirty secret doors, each concealing an unknown but assured fortune. \u00a0 We selected a combination of plates from the meat, vegetables, and sides. \u00a0The only way we could possible narrow down choices was to sorrowfully sacrifice the mains, 'nibbles,' and fish, and what we did try was astonishing.I could rhapsodize at length about each of the dishes. \u00a0The highlights among the vegetables were the courgette (aka zucchini) and manouri fritters with cardamom yoghurt, and the crushed butterbeans with muhammara and walnuts. \u00a0The fritters were crisp on the outside and very moist on the inside, with a subtle infusion of cardamom in the fritter and the yogurt for good measure. \u00a0The earthy, coarsely crushed butterbeans were enlived by the robust muhammara, a traditional Syrian pepper sauce: \u00a0plenty of zing, but not overwhelming spice. \u00a0The twice-cooked baby chicken with lemon myrtle salt and chili sauce and the pork belly with pineapple and long pepper chutney and winter sour greens were our favorite meats. \u00a0I don't really have to say much about these dishes -- imagine the juxtaposition of ingredients assembled with care, creativity, and expertise, and you'll conjure the fantastic results. \u00a0The pork belly was especially interesting and well-executed, with a mind-boggling range of flavors.The vegetable highlight was char-grilled purple sprouting broccoli, a vegetable I'd yet to encounter in my life but hope to meet again, with the divine combination of tahini and miso folded generously over, around and under each stalk and floret. \u00a0We eschewed the more intense chocolate desserts and the undoubtedly toothsome financiers, opting instead for a palate cleanser of sorts, a Chinese dessert known as tau fu fa. \u00a0Normally made with soft tofu, Ottolenghi has taken coconut milk and set it in the fashion of panna cotta, topping it with sliced fresh coconut and mango and with ginger gula gawa, a potion of uncertain but celestial origin.",

Luckily when a friend came to visit we decided to book a table for brunch (after scouring Yelp reviews for brunch in that area).The interior is beautiful; bright golds and whites along with lovely wooden tables, and it's so light and spacious. The service was also first class with very friendly attentive staff.We were sat at a table for two at the front of the restaurant (you can also book a spot down at the communal table by the kitchens which looks fun) and were immediately handed glasses of water - this is an instant plus in my book! We were then given our menus and enough time to peruse. Although the brunch menu is fairly small there are a few things on there which are a little different and totally delicious sounding so it took me a while to decide. The waitress also offered explanations where necessary, of which I had as they have an amazing sounding black rice & coconut milk dish that I wanted a little more clarity on (by the way it's served warm). In the end my friend went for scrambled egg on toast and I went for the French toast. Both were amazing! Be warned the French toast is very fragrant (which I loved). We also each ordered their fresh mint tea which was so refreshing. In total it came to \u00a313 each with tip and we were well and truly satisfied. I can't wait to go back to try more of their breakfast items (brisket hash & shackshuka) as well as their lunch & dinner menu.",

Small selection of drinks, wine and a few beers. We ordered about 10 dishes, a good portion of the menu. Nothing disappointed but didn't wow. If you slather enough goat cheese and herbs \u00a0on anything it will taste good. Many non celebrity Chicago restaurants are doing a better job with similar, creative Mediterranean inspired menus (e.g. Fig & Olive) have much bigger menu & alcohol selections, bigger and brighter spaces and better price / value balance.",

    "text": "Heard about Ottolenghi a few months ago when my uncle came to town and was taken there by one of his Italian friends - they both raved about it, but to be honest that was it, didn't really think much of it. It wasn't until my boyfriends parents came to visit from the Netherlands that we decided to give it a try - Ottolenghi is my mother-in-law's favorite chef! We had no choice! I did a bit of research, because turns out he has about 5 different places around town! Nopi seemed like a good choice for a proper lunch. Let's start with the decor - all white, simple but classy. Proper tables upstairs, whilst downstairs you can see into the kitchen but have one big table to share - not a issue at all, but worth keeping in mind it is somewhat louder downstairs. The toilets definitely require a mention! Mirrors everywhere!!! Looks good but have to say a little confusing! I might even suggest going to the loo before you start drinking! Or remember to bring your phone in with you in case you need to make an emergency save me phone all!!! But the food, that's what we are interested about, isn't it? Fantastic Mediterranean Middle Eastern food, with wonderful wordly flavours with a serious focus on vegetables, but amazing fish & meat options too, do not worry! Really extraordinary flavours! Highly highly recommend. I even went to buy the cookbook straight after! Highlights are most definitely the courgette manouri fritters, the octopus was delicious. The lamb sweetbreads, oh la la! Not sure if you are familiar with that but its basically the thymus & pancreas of the lamb, might not sound appetizing but don't ask questions and just go for it, honestly! The different vegetables and sides are also very very good. Maybe worth mentioning the truffle potenta chips weren't quite as exciting as I hoped, but the tomato salad however basic you may think it is, it is not!!Have most definitely decided to try out the rest of his restaurants!! Will keep you updated! :)",

It was amazing, and you should go too.My mother is a MASSIVE fan of Ottolenghi, and has been experimenting from his Jerusalem book for the past 3 years. My mum is an amazing cook so I was really excited about this.The venue is a great representation of the food you will be served: simple, but tasteful and original. You feel that you are in a nice place, but didn't have an over-the-top feel to it - you feel welcome.The menu is divided into 3 main sections:- Nibbles- Mains- SharingMy friend and I having similar culinary tastes, we decided to go for a mix of dishes from the Nibbles and Sharing, and we went for:- Vegetables with avocado: as simple as it gets, but with amazing seasoning that just brings out the flavour of amazing products. Just make sure you like radish and baby carrots.- Prosciutto: good prosciutto doesn't need much. It was perfect- Burrata: With grilled coriander. Oh. My- Aubergine with yoghurt- Pork Shoulder Croquette: SO TENDER AND TASTY- ScallopsMay I also recommend the Vitovska wine? It is an orange wine that goes really well with the sharing platter. I would say that we ordered the perfect amount of food to feel full but not stuffed. The products used are incredibly tasty and fresh, and with flavours you wouldn't usually be used to - which turns the whole meal into a great culinary experience.When can we go back?",

    "text": "I'm so sad to write this review... Let me preface this - I love chef Ottolenghi. I have almost all of his cookbooks and I love them all. So when we were planning a trip to London, a visit to Nopi was a must. I was so excited to be there and I really wanted to just love every spoonful of my dinner here. First off, the service was amazing. Our waiter was very helpful and very attentive to us the whole time we were there and we enjoyed the ambiance of the place as well, with white and brass colors, and the visit the bathroom was a trip (mirrors, that's all I'll say). We opted for his vegetarian appetizers all of which were displayed up front and you could see them before you ordered them. We opted for roasted aubergines and sweet potatoes. Both were ok. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but was waiting for explosions of flavor,and while they were both solid, they weren't very memorable and I think his cookbooks have much better recipes that could have replaced those. For entrees, we chose duck breast and sea bass. The duck was amazing. That definitely hit all the notes and expectations I had and we simply loved it. The sea bass we felt was overpowered by the spices in the spiced butter it was covered with and ultimately left us longing for something different. We ended with the chocolate ganache desert on recommendation of our waiter and it didn't disappoint. It was excellent. Overall, there were some highs and some flats on this one. The rating is based on this specific meal, and perhaps had we opted for other items on the menu, it would be higher. I still remain a big fan of the chef, and I will still come back next time we're in London and perhaps try different items on the menu.",

So I ordered everything on the menu 2-3 times over. Nice presentation, but would have expected more punch to the food as it lacked typical Mediterranean flavor a I would have expected. With all the rave reviews, it must have been an off night. I may be tempted to return here perhaps on my own first next time.

    "text": "For the sake of this review let's generalise for a minute and split the world of restoration into two categories: the one that has dishes made tasty by a variety of strong flavours and ingredients aplenty, and the one that focuses on few ingredients, but REALLY good ones. Nopi is definitely part of the latter category. It's your typical 'pay a lot for smallish portions' and yet you leave the restaurant with a singing palate. I took one of my best friends there for her birthday and I'm really happy I did: we ordered two starters/nibbles dishes and 4 dishes to share, which included a bit of everything: from veggie crudit\u00e9s to burrata, from aubergines to scallops, and every thing was spot-on. The flavours were incredible. Nicely presented too, which I always like. We were actually wondering where can they possibly source such good and fresh ingredients. We had lunch upstairs (I believe there is a downstairs too, with communal tables). The room is bright and airy, there's space to move around the tables without knocking someone's vino down with your butt (don't ask) and the tables for two can actually accommodate two people PLUS the food. Amazing, right? I'm so used to having to push plates around to fit everything in some restaurants. We also tried their orange wine, which was very yummy. I'd definitely go back, probably to try something from their dinner menu. Very impressed, bravo NOPI!",

    "text": "I can't believe that I'm about to say that I was disappointed in NOPI, but I was. Considering how complex and intimidating Ottolenghi's cookbooks are, I was just expecting a little bit more from him. The food wasn't bad, as Yelp suggests for three stars, it was A-OK. I found that the courgette fritters were way too aggressively seasoned. They were super salty. We also had the burrata, which was actually my favorite. It's hard to screw up a big blob of cheese. It was accented with coriander seeds, which were great for taste and texture, and blood orange helped cut through the creaminess of the cheese. For my main, I had a roasted eggplant dish and a side of the lentils. The eggplant was actually quite good, but the lentils were almost inedibly salted. Adam had the baby chicken, which he seemed to like a lot. We finished with a dessert that was like an apple crumble with a celery gelato. This is maybe where my expectations were crushed most. I have had celery flavored gelato and ice cream before, and this just really didn't pack a lot of the flavor we were hoping for. Considering the price, I'm not sure that we'd make a repeat visit to NOPI.",

I subsequently have bought every one of his other cookbooks and utilize them as frequently as possible. I love taking the time to make his intricate, beautiful dishes for Sunday night family dinners. So, when I booked a trip to London recently, I knew going to one of his restaurants was a must on the itinerary - We decided on Nopi. It was hands-down my best dining experience in London. We sat upstairs, and it was beautiful. Every aspect of the d\u00e9cor was stunning, and clearly a lot of thought was put into making the dining space feel elegant yet cozy. I'm glad we sat upstairs for a more intimate experience, but the downstairs communal table overlooking the kitchen looked fun, too! For lunch, we ordered the burrata/peach, chickpeas and squash with feta, scallops, the chicken with chilli sauce and truffle polenta chips with garlic aioli. The flavors of all the dishes were outstanding. The chickpeas were my favorite because it was a warm, hearty dish packed with lots of Mediterranean flavor. I also has a carrot/ginger juice that was quite refreshing. Everything was coursed out perfectly, and the staff was attentive and friendly. If I ever return to London, I'd definitely go back to Nopi.",

The service was attentive, the food was exploding with flavour, and the ambiance was perfect - quiet, not too \"posh\"/\"stuffy\" but still high end. One of the dishes we ordered wans't available and instead we got 3 other things on the house. It was a delightful gesture.We had aubergine, fish, the \"cheesecake\" dessert, and a number of other delights. The flavours and the food was outstanding. So much so that in the end I bought a signed copy of Ottolenghi's second book.The price, by the way, while on the high side is definitely acceptable for a fancy London restaurant - around 40-45 GBP per person, including a lot of appetizers and a bottle of wine and service.",

The service was very wonderful, they were nice to us, the place was full but not churring busy, and we had a long table on the street window side of the room. LOVED the decor, (as artist/designer myself) there was no detail left un curated. All in all lovely! would go back in a flash. \u00a0Finally the bathroom.

    "text": "Barged in on a Tuesday evening at 6:20pm and requested the pre-theater prix fixe menu -- and was promptly seated at a lovely table for two near the back bar area (under a skylight). \u00a0The pre-theater menu is priced per person, and served family style (communal plates). \u00a0First two courses were served together: \u00a0(1) sweet potato with goat cheese, and (2) eggplant with fromage blanc and pomagranite seeds. \u00a0OMG. \u00a0The sweet potato with goat cheese = brilliant combination. \u00a0I would not have thought of it in a million years, and it was delicious. \u00a0The eggplant was good too, but not quite as inspired as the sweet potato (did I mention that sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods, so perhaps I'm biased...). Third course was a pan fried mackeral, which was really well done -- crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and really mackerally. \u00a0MMMM. \u00a0The fourth and fifth courses were served together: \u00a0(4) pressed baby chicken (think of 1/2 of a cornish game hen size) served with peppered salt and sweet-sour mince (not sauce), and (5) duck confit with a plum preserve. \u00a0The chicken was so cute (e.g., small portion) -- but delicious with the sauce and salt accent. \u00a0The duck confit was a bit strange. \u00a0There was a mint note that just didn't fit with the plum or the duck, and I'm still not sure of the source. \u00a0Service was impeccable. \u00a0The only off note was that there was a really long pause between the 3rd and 4th courses. \u00a0Perhaps 20 minutes. \u00a0We did tell the hostess that we had to leave by 7:30pm to catch our show, and we left at 7:20pm -- so that was perfect (no, we were not rushed or nervous about the time). \u00a0I would definitely come back to NOPI, and would definitely consider taking clients here as well (it's both a date and business ambiance). \u00a0Great atmosphere, great service, great food! \u00a0p.s. -- look at my star distribution in my profile, I'm not a pushover who gives 5 stars all the time!!",

For tourists like me, go behind Hamleys on Regent and you'll find NOPI, which stands for \"North of Piccadilly.\" I wasn't pleased with our greeting. It was as if we didn't belong there without reservations, yet there were 5-7 tables open the entire time we dined there. They seated us at the bar, which is weird, given my daughter is 11...but I wasn't going to correct them given that the hostesses were a wee bit snobbish. Aside from that, the service at the bar was great and the food ranged from just OK to excellent. I am rating on food and bar service only (not the above mentioned snobbery).They recommend 3 small savory plates per person, so we ordered 6 between us and shared them all. Plates are nicely split into categories: Veg, fish, meat, sweets. I wish we had ordered more of the veg plates and skipped the meat. But that's hindsight.We tried:--Winter coleslaw w/macadamia and mango (very good)--Five spice tofu (STUNNING! Wish we had ordered 3 of these and skipped some of the others. Only bummer is you literally only get 2 small squares of tofu. Trust me, you'll want more. Don't let the \"tofu\" part dissuade you.)--Seared prawns, fennel, feta (just Ok)--Seared scallops, fennel puree, apple salsa (good)--Slow cooked pork belly, coco bean cassoulet, salsa verde (just OK)--Roasted beef sirloin (just OK)Were I to come back (and I would if I lived here)...I'd make it for happy hour only and have another great Lychee and Grapefruit Cooler with vodka and mint and lemon. And then I'd order a couple of the 5-spice tofu dishes and some of the other veg dishes that sounded great, but we didn't try....and call it a night.Oh, and I do not jest, whether you need to or not, visit the bathrooms. You've never seen anything like it. I wish I had taken my camera in there...",

Both lovely, just different in atmosphere. When you walk in, it's immediately a nice place to be. A white and yellow colour scheme with natural light makes it feel airy and spacious. Gold finishings add to this, with marble flooring and LOADS of space between seats. The best place to sit is the first table of two, at the back of the restaurant on the right hand side.The bathrooms are a mirrored headtrip too, totally disorientating and a load of fun.So, we sit, we order a pineapple & sage martini (which has a somewhat spicy kick to it) and a rum &pistachio cocktail. We're not rushed, the drinks are delicious, and we admire our surroundings.We're brought a complimentary plate of hummus with aubergine and bread with olive oil. Simple, but delicious. The oil was super green, the hummus absolutely perfect.Our waitress was attentive but not pushy, knew the menu inside out and indulged all of our questions.We went for roast asparagus with a smoky tomato sauce and broccolini with lemon mash from the vegetable selection. They recommend three dishes per person, and I'd agree. I love simplicity, and the menu here is divided into three sections.One from each. Easy. Anyway. You know you're somewhere special when a chef manages to make vegetables that tasty. Both dishes were stunning. I've never tasted anything like that lemon mash.From the fish selection we had the mackerel \u00a0with red lentils (yum) and prawns (huge and meaty, but with delicate flavour). For meat we had beef sirloin (obviously) and twice-baked chicken, which deserves a special mention for being juicy and tender.The wine list is equally eclectic, divided into sections such as 'off the beaten track', from which we chose a beautiful Italian red.We chatted to our waitress while we switched out an initial crab dish for the prawns, since it wasn't to our taste. She replaced it without fuss, and we weren't charged. My other half asked to keep a menu (since they're printed with the date and it was a nice keepsake for his birthday). Then when our deserts came out, there was a candle a piped chocolate birthday message on his. A lovely touch, and something we didn't even ask for.For me, the desert was the star of the show. I recently had the best ice cream I've ever tasted at da Polpo, so my bar is high, but I have to say that the pineapple galette with coconut ice cream at Nopi was phenomenal. It was divine. We also had the coffee pecan financiers with maple cream. Both dishes were made fresh and were hot from the oven.Sure it's pricey here (we paid \u00a3125 including service), but, you get what you pay for. The experience is fantastic and well worth EVERY penny.",

Nopi continues with the small plate theme---lots of excellent tapas-sized dishes to choose from. The standouts (see pics) included the grilled sea bream, braised pig cheek (I wish we ordered 2 of this, it was fall off your fork tender) and the goat cheese/asparagus starter. For dessert be sure get an espresso martini and the freshly baked financiers.I recommend eating in the sightly more informal downstairs dining room, which consists of 2 very large common tables right in the middle of the pantry. You get to hear (and possibly) see the chefs hard at work in the open kitchen, and also get a chance to interact with other diners. And do check out the toilets...the mirrors are a total trip.Service was excellent---prompt, polite, and oh so knowledgeable about the menu. Our waitress also allowed us to sample a few wines before selecting a bottle. She also went out of her way to accomodate my friend's allergies.Only downside...it's ridiculously expensive for what you get...try 8 quid for a small plate of broccolini! Be sure to bring that expense account!",

This particular place was tapas style. \u00a0My friend and I sat at a communal table downstairs, the ambience was mood-lit and it was enjoyable. Everyone tells me that England isn't particularly known for their cuisine, but I beg to differ. I really enjoyed every restaurant I dined in, this one the most. The food tasted gourmet. Everything was fresh and hot, the ingredients were delicious, the flavors were delicately paired. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. The service is pretty good as well.All I can say is don't hesitate. Just go, sit in, enjoy the atmosphere with your mates and try the AUBERGINE!",

I have both of Ottolenghi's books, (Plenty & Plenty More) and each time I've cooked something, its come out great- so I may have been expecting a lot more at his London restaurant - unfortunately it wasn't. \u00a0The cod fish entree was so-so, and the appetizers were nice but not as nice as it sounded on the menu. I was told that produce in London isn't as great as what you get in California and mostly imported from neighboring countries -we are spoiled for choice by farmers markets and produce grown an hour away in CA, so minimal cooking can bring intense flavors - so I'm just assuming thats what it was. I do love his cookbooks, his veg paella is still my fav but I'm not sure Nopi was.",

Once we got seated it took a while till we were served with some water.The waitress was friendly and helpful. We started with a few bites and were super disappointed with pretty average olives and a standard nut mix (in some restaurants that would have been complementary especially considering the low quality). It took them a very long time to bring the next dish which was a pre-made aubergine salad. The station for the salad was basically next to our table but it took them whooping 20mins to load that into a plate and bring it over. The salad itself was not very flavorful and flat - nothing special.This experience continued when we got the burrata. We didn't like the seeds on top at all and the burrata itself had an unusual flavor. When we were asked how we liked it we mentioned the burrata and our waitress got it off the bill - that was great service.The chicken was a bit too dry and the rib a bit too undercooked. The best dish was the sea bass - but that was an OKish dish considering the price.The best here was the friendly waitress and some great cocktails. The food was not good at all, especially at this price level.This restaurant seems to live off the celebrity name of the owner. You can definitely do better in SoHo.",

A range of 'half sized' plates allowed for a great selection to arrive and to try many different dishes.Stand out performers were the duck, the pork belly, scallops, twice cooked chicken and the truffled polenta chips. Oh my the chips. HAVE THESE! Amazing.Oh and be sure to check out the bathrooms! You'll see why. Not sure what impressed one of the girls in our group more, the bathrooms, or the Irish waiter.

All I kept thinking was that if this was any indicator of the rest of the meal, I should just raise my flag from now. The decor was simple and classy. Not very inviting or homely but clean and sophisticated.The service was great.But it's all about the food. Two definite musts: Pork Sirloin is the bomb and helllooooooo brussell sprouts. Every dish was a unique combination with a HOLY BURST OF INTENSE FLAVOURS, Batman. I was left in disbelief that the possibility of the next would taste superior to the previous and just when I thought the bar could not be raised any higher, I was proved wrong. With each bite, our eyes dimmed closed, mouths dropped open and a deep exhale was inevitable. Is this real life? Is this heaven? This IS heaven. Alas, it IS real life and now my favourite restaurant of all time. Seriously though, I will now forever recommend Nopi to EVERYONE. Visitor and locals alike. Everyone that has taste-buds, a semi-large wallet and a love for delicious food. It should be noted that while the food is share-able, you probably won't want to share. In fact, if eating with me, you might get stabbed with a fork if you try to take the last bite of anything. Especially when it comes to dessert. You have been warned.The only disappointment was the house wine. For what this restaurant was and what we experienced, I was expecting something more of the house wine but I guess if anything had to be lacking, I'm glad it was just that.Dreams are made of this place.Protips:+ It's a perfect place for a romantic date. + Check out the bathrooms.Also, NOPI: If you keep delivering food this unbelievably tasty, I have nothing more to say other than shut up and take my money.",

    "text": "Interesting place. I can see how others might rave about the food, place, and service. All as expected. I'm torn, though, on whether to give a 3- or 4- star review. Scallops: three served on a plate. Delicious. Peppers: two large (or maybe three small) on a plate. Meh. Sirloin: three thin slices. Very good. For two people, maybe one more starter would have been better. Unfortunately, of the main dish selections for the evening jumped out at me and demanded my order. So, I decided to try something I'd never try at home: the chickpea pancake. A very nice, light, and appropriately spicy dish that reminded me of some of the more stellar falafel I've had in my travels. I can't complain, though I wouldn't (as some previous commenters have suggested) want to get on a plane and fly across the ocean for it. Not even inspired enough to buy the cookbook. So, just to help level set expectations, I'll go with a rounded down 3 (from a 3.5). Tasty, but perhaps not as worthy of the hype to get the 4th star.",

    "text": "In what I can only assume is driven by a strong US dollar and favorable airfare rates, it seems like everyone I know is taking a trip across the pond these days. We were on the early end of this recent fad (sure, you can call me a trendsetter, I'm OK with that), and when I hear anyone headed to London - friends, co-workers, straphangers, you name it - I give them one very firm recommendation: go to NOPI. It was easily the best meal I had in town, and those who have taken me up on my advice, have returned with the same all-around praise for this Soho stunner.I had made a booking some weeks in advance and mentioned in the notes it being an anniversary. When we arrived, the front of house warmly took our coats as if we were coming to see old friends at their well-curated home, and immediately put complimentary champagne in our hands, in recognition of our special occasion and thanking us for choosing to spend it with them. The dining room's decor was understated yet striking, white and gold everythang, with an open kitchen in the back. When I'd later venture downstairs, I would discover a livelier, more casual, communal set-up, and memorable toilets with angled mirrors, a washroom which seems to be \"selfie central\" and a destination all its own on Instagram.After my champagne came a cocktail order of their Pineapple and Absinthe Shrub. And then another. And another. And... I ended up having five of 'em throughout the night. You might say I really enjoyed this drink. It was made with pineapple, punch syrup, apple vinegar, absinthe, and a ginseng aperitif called Kamm & Sons I'm almost certain I'd never tried before. Anyway. Five of 'em.And if the interior design, service, and cocktails weren't special enough, we come to the cuisine. We ordered a handful of plates to share, and when we asked our waiter to make sure we didn't miss out on any musts, he wasted no time in recommending the Lemon Sole. It was the most simple dish we ate, but also the most sensational - perfectly cooked fish, swimming in burnt butter and just a hint of nori. And because the chef is known for his inventiveness and versatility specifically with vegetables, make sure to order the Roasted Aubergine, essentially halved eggplants stuffed with a mixture of yoghurt, black garlic, herbs, and pine nuts, and the Courgette and Manouri Fritters, a heartier take on fried zucchini.In fact, don't listen to me at all and order anything you want here. I'm that confident it'll be tremendous even if I haven't had it. In a global city as big as London, with God knows how many other restaurants, I'm 100% returning to NOPI next time I'm in town. And I promise you that's not the shrubs talking.",

I sat at the bar as I was traveling alone for work but didn't feel lonely at all. The servers at the bar were helpful and fun as were my bar guests who ended up sharing small plates with me. I had a light citrus salad with pink peppercorns which are a magical ingredient when used with restraint; signature zucchini and cheese fritters; and a small plate of sea bream cooked to perfection in a light broth. Every bite was incredible. Desserts looked terrific but I didn't save enough room. This is a must-go destination on any London trip.",

People rave about this place but I found it to be lacking, mostly in the flavors of the food.I own the cookbook and have ogled photos of the restaurant for eons. \u00a0I thought I was in for a real treat with vegetable dishes that we're sure to deliver, but flavors were not all there. Many of the veggies were displayed as a cold anti pasta bar and yet still pricey. They were sitting out for hours and not made fresh to order.The cocktail that was a gin punch was remarkable and worth having more than one of. Chicken was very good. Cheesecake appetizer was also very good and unique. Okra was refreshing and flavorful. \u00a0Everything else I found to be ok if not unmemorable. Eggplant was my least favorite, followed by the zucchini fritters and butternut squash. Service was excellent and very friendly. Atmosphere was a nice blend of modern and inviting. All white brick walls with modern lighting.",

And our last visit was pretty much spoiled because of the exceedingly unfriendly service.Basically the very explicit body language made us feel very unwelcome, and this feeling was later confirmed when we were offered the bill before the dessert menu...Was it because it was a busy Sunday and staff was under stress, or because we were with a 3 year old, or just because that particular staff member was going through bad times? I don't know, but it was a bad experience, bad enough to stop eating there.",

They have a interesting wine list. We ordered 3 vegetable dishes and 3 fish. All with clean tastes and interesting mixes. They are tapas in size. We all had the cardinium rice pudding with an glorious raisin cake of a desert wine. Heaven. A bit pricey. Came to \u00a350 per head but such a great evening. As the waiter kept saying 'enjoy!'",

    "text": "NOPI is the new venture of Yotam Ottolenghi, founder of London's highly successful gourmet deli/cafe chain \"Ottolenghi\". As a huge fan of deli, his columns in the Guardian newspaper, along with the recipes from his best-selling cookbooks, I had very high expectations of NOPI. Upon arrival, it was fairly obvious that much thought had been invested into the minor details of the restaurant. The golden \"O\" in the NOPI logo appeared to be a re-occurring theme throughout; from the coat tags given out at the front reception, the brass coloured vase, the shiny brass bar area at the back, right down to the napkin rings gave the restaurant a very stylish feel. And it was great to see the good man himself sat at the bar with friends ensuring that the cogs in the restaurant were running smoothly too! As with all the \"hot tables\" sweeping across London, with the likes of Bocca di Lupo, Polpo and Polpetto, the dishes are designed for sharing and it is recommended that you order three dishes per person. Our table of four ordered 9 savoury dishes and 2 desserts between us. Highlights was definitely the seared prawns with feta. This was a surprise winner given we weren't too sure about the combination to begin with, and without a doubt on the dessert front...the Pineapple gallette! You wouldn't have guessed that I'm not a huge fruit dessert fan as I launched into the thing - clearly eating beyond my quarter ration and practically licking the plate :) The bill came to about \u00a340 per head including a cocktail per person. Admittedly with a couple of mixed reviews warning that prices were steep (\u00a310 average per plate) and not to expect Ottolenghi's usual fare cuisine wise, I was a little bit apprehensive. But after our dining experience, I thought the meal was well worth the money based on NOPI's ethos of food quality, freshness and general gorgeousness.

The seating here is two large communal tables, but the spacing is such that you feel like you really have your own space. The space is warm, and you feel a bit like you are sitting in the pantry as you are right next to shelves filled with scrumptious looking ingredients.I tried a couple of the cocktails, and was quite pleased. Interesting blends of juices and spirits, and a good range of flavours. Very easy to pair one cocktail with food and another with dessert.The waitstaff were really great! Answered all of our questions, and even brought us a sample of one of the components of a dish so we could taste a little bit before deciding what to order. Plus, bonus points for someone asking if it was okay to take away my cocktail (I really hate it when you are nursing that one last sip in the bottom of the glass and some pushy busperson whisks it away before you can protest).There was not a single dish that we tried that was not fantastic. Brilliant vegetarian options, and really good seafood (I don't eat meat so can't comment on that part of the menu). I remember incredible lemon curd, gorgeous asparagus (something I don't generally jump at ordering), scallops, etc. Then there was dessert. I highly recommend the lime and tapioca.I am looking forward to dining here again soon!",

    "text": "Yotam Ottolenghi's posh restaurant offers stunningly inventive and flavourful food but with a few drawbacksOK, so first, and most importantly, the food. The shortish menu's divvied up into tasting plates that can also serve as starters, and a few mains. So you can order a la carte classic or a bunch of tapas-like small plates to share. Each plate we tried (nb: we're veggie) was superbly balanced, beautifully constructed and managed that stunning balancing act of both wacking great flavours that smack you round the mouth, but simultaneously delicate, intricate and subtle interplay between ingredients. That Ottolenghi's a smart chef \u00a0and he shows it off to great effect here. Plus, ingredients are super-fresh and tasty.That's how he can charge such high prices, basically. Yup, look at the menu and (if you're an average bloke like me), suck your breath in and start making calculations about whether you can afford two bottles of wine and pudding. For me, it's a special occasion meal price \u00a0but apparently not for most of the clientele. Which is drawback #2.Yup, Yuppies live! (it would seem). Expense account businessmen and newly-minted web developers on a coke binge dining their PRs seemed to be the order of the night on the Thursday we went. The conversation was loud on a few tables, the dresses very showy, and there was a lot of flashy ordering of expensive booze and cocktails. Don't these people know we're in the middle of a recession? And can they not keep down the boasts about their sexual performance just a tad while I'm trying to eat?!To go with the high-end prices and high-scale customer/idiots there is also slightly intrusive waiting. It's one of those places where someone tops up your wine the moment you're down to half a glass. That said, our sommelier was good at combining wine knowledge with witty banter \u00a0and struck the right note with us, which for him obviously meant a slight shift in tone from the usual clientele.Finally, decor, is bizarre. The upstairs is a tad too stark \u00a0white tile walls bounce the (aforementioned braying) sound about too much. But the real star is the toilets \u00a0like the Sultan Of Brunei's WC, only I'm guessing even more gaudy \u00a0with ludicrous mirrors everywhere.All that said, I bring you back to the start and the food \u00a0it's absolutely brilliant. And for the odd flash meal out, that trumps all other concerns.",

    "text": "Nopi is one of the few places where it doesn't really matter what you decide to order. I have been to plenty of great restaurants in which I found the food good, but I didn't like everything... and honestly, that is to be expected as everyone has specific tastes. I went to Nopi with a group of 5 and we split about 15 of the dishes with the thought we would re-order our favorites afterwards. When we got to the end of the meal, everyone was stuffed (definitely larger than tapas) and no one could agree on one dish that was better than the others! We agreed that it was just necessary to come back. Honestly, the prices definitely reflect the quality and if its too expensive for you, I'm sure Nopi will survive as there is quite a waiting list. We booked 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday night and barely made it in off the waiting list (mostly thanks to my girlfriends persistance on the phone). My advice: Go with a group. This is a seriously deep menu and believe me you'll want to taste as much of it as possible! Standouts for me were the Aubergine tart, broccolini, and the cheesecake (not a dessert, if you can believe it).",

    "text": "I am just about getting over my fullness enough so that I can sit up and type. I have had the lucky privilege of going to today, Ottolenghi's new restaurant venture. If you're not in the know, Ottolenghi is a set of food shops/cafes in London that focus on fresh punchy ingredients, full of bright and bold flavors. I've been a fan for a while and often dabble in recipes from their older cookbook and when I spotted on twitter that they were doing a soft opening for Nopi at 50% off, I jumped at the chance and booked a table for me and my boyfriend's family. Nopi itself is absolutely stunning. Tucked just behind bustling Regent Street the restaurant is housed in a beautiful two floored building; the ground floor which you enter on is decorated almost entirely in bold white marble and glittering golden brass, so that any colour in the furniture and food really pops out at you, overall the feel of the place is sleek, formal and bright. Downstairs the basement is setup in a canteen style with delicious store cupboard products on display and a view straight into the kitchen making the space feel warm and more casual. On walking in, I was faced with a beautiful ornate gold lampshade, a bowl of overflowing, brash red chillis and a view to the back of the restaurant where I could see smiling staff bustling around tables of diners sharing food. Immediately, our coats were taken, we were shown to our table smack bang in the middle of the restaurant and handed paper dated menus. The menu varied slightly to the one shown online, but it was exciting, assorted and easy to read. Even though we were clearly somewhere very special and a bit posh, there was no menu intimidation; dishes were split into 'meat', 'fish' and 'veg' and there was no offputting language, cooking techniques or ingredients I hadn't heard of. We all took Ottolenghi's advice and went for what seems to be their unique selling point; grab three savory dishes each and share the whole lot with everyone round the table. There was plenty of umming and ahhing about having two and a half each so as not to over-order, but logistics and excitement at the delectable menu got the better of us and before we knew it we were all declaring our choices so as not to miss out on anything. Food started arriving within about 15 minutes, and once it did, it didn't seem to stop. Our dishes came out at different times, not when they were ready in the kitchen, but more as the staff saw fit. Food came grouped into complimenting formats, with ingredients and flavours that seemed to match. They arrived about three at a time which meant we had time to really oogle over and appreciate each one. I won't go through each and every dish, but want to show you some of the ones that really stood out as a unique culinary experiences. Some of them were like nothing else I have ever eatean, which is an impressive declaration for such tiny dishes. The beef brisket croquets were incredible and appreciated by all. They were crunchy and crisp on the outside and were filled with pulled beef that oozed with salty, rich juices when you sliced into them. They were cut through by the Asian Slaw which was light, citrusy and fresh. The lamb meatballs were a complete triumph. The lamb was pink and tender and rolled with crunchy pine-nuts and topped with surprise smoked aubergine that tasted of bbqs and bonfires. The yoghurt sauce was creamy, nutty and moreish and the pomegranate was so light and fresh that it made me feel like I wasn't eating anything too naughty.. Then the Ossobuco with polenta arrived, I admit I've never cooked with polenta so have no idea if anyone and everyone can get the stuff tasting that good, but my oh my, it turned out to be my favourite dish. It was smeared onto the plate like a squashed pancake, was deliciously cheesy and smooth and paired perfectly with the soft, flaked ossobuco (veal shanks braised in white wine, vegetables and thier broth). If you take any of my recommendations to heart make sure it's this one. The vege dishes were just as fabulous, the cheesey, sweet and creamy fondant swede gratin a particular favourite thanks to its contrasting textures of soft swede and crunchy cabbage (and not only because it came in a lovely individual pot). The winter greens were rich and juicy yet retained a crunchy bite and the baked cheesecake? Well that lasted only seconds, it was literally eaten so quickly that I couldn't get a photo! The blu di pecora, which is a blue veined sheeps cheese, was balanced with sweet leaks and baked until it was light and almost quiche like. Burrata is a type of mozzarella that from the outside mimics an ordinary mozarella completely, but on the inside is a mix of the stringy cheese as we know and love it and rich delicious cream. As we chopped through it sourish white liquid spilt out and mingled delciously with the sweet, sharp blood orange segments and the fragrant coriander seeds. The green beans sadly never materialised",

We preferred a table upstairs. We had the burata, roasted cauliflower and mackerel as 'appetisers', and the double-cooked chicken (which tasted quite Asian and was served with ginger chilli sauce and salt), fried courgette flowers and 2 sides (quinoa and potatoes) for 'mains'. We could have done with one less side dish as there was too much food (note: we have big appetites!). We shared the financiers for dessert which wasn't as special as the other dishes. Our favourites were the burata, mackerel and chicken. Service was a bit disappointing though for a restaurant of this standard. Our waiter was very pleasant and friendly, but on 2 occasions cleared our plates even though we were just finishing our food, and took our napkin away before we ordered dessert. Although quite pricey, the food was really good and we will visit again.",

Both dishes were cooked brilliantly and the freshness of the ingredients shined through. Having had a fair share of shakshukas, this one ranks high with the addition of smoked labneh that brings a great flavor punch to the large tomato and golden egg combo. The toast with slightly burnt edges adds a nice depth.The corn cakes were also well balanced with great textures from the whole sweet corn mixed into the cake and the avocado salsa brings a nice creamy, citrus finish. Combine it all together with the mixed greens and the flavor profile was worth the visit!",

    "text": "On vacation in London, I used Yelp religiously to find great restaurants for my family and me to try out. We love Mediterranean food, so when I came upon NOPI, with its nice photos, rave reviews, and the menu, we quickly made a reservation. Located in SoHo just steps from Regent St and Piccadilly Circus, NOPI is on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle yet close enough to be convenient to walk to. When we arrived for our reservation at NOPI, the hostesses were so sweet and hung up our coats and and umbrellas (free of charge) before leading us to our table. On the main level, the space at NOPI is long and narrow with a small alcove in the front and a full bar in the back. As you can see from many of the pictures, NOPI is a bright space with lots of white and gold accents. Downstairs is the kitchen with a large communal table, perfect for private parties and large groups. The tables upstairs are suitable for small groups of 2-6 people. There's bar seating as well.The menu has many options, including dishes to share, and it caters well to vegetarians. My party and I started our meal with a few dishes to share: butternut squash and the sea bream. Both were absolutely delicious -- I highly recommend! For our main dishes, I had the duck leg confit while the other two in my party both had the chickpea pancake. We enjoyed all of our dishes. The duck was falling off the bone, and it was perfectly paired with a crisp, fresh coconut salad. We had two side dishes to share as well: brussels sprouts and the kale, apple, and turnip salad. We enjoyed our entire meal! For dessert, we had the blackcurrant sorbet and the roasted pineapple with coconut ice cream and macadamia nuts. Both were excellent, and I particularly liked the simple roasted pineapple that was warm and naturally sweet.We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at NOPI from the ambience and the food presentation to the food itself and the service from the hostesses and waitstaff. This is definitely a top restaurant on our list whenever we plan to visit London again!",

I made a reservation the day of on a Thursday night for 6PM online without a problem. I heard of this restaurant because a friend in New York had Ottolenghi's cookbook and cooked something for us. I loved what she cooked so had to try the restaurant in London. Best decision ever! We ordered 1 main dish and a few sides. The main was the confit duck leg and the sides were the twice-cooked baby chicken, Valdeon cheesecake, and the venison w/ peanuts & blackberries. The cheesecake was by far my favourite dish. I could have eaten a whole one for myself!! All of the dishes were bursting in flavour! The venison was incredible! There was a perfect balance of flavours with the sauce, the peanuts, and blackberries. The lemon myrtle salt with the also made the dish wonderful. Lastly, the duck was also just the perfect way to end the meal. We were too stuffed to get dessert! The service was great! The atmosphere was wonderful as well. I would highly recommend this and would definitely return again!",

    "text": "Oh no, NOPI!! We were sooooo excited for a visit to NOPI. I have cooked from each of the Ottolenghi cookbooks extensively and just love the food. It is always so surprising how well certain combinations work, how easy it is to prepare a wonderful feast with a healthy array of great ingredients. In this case, I think we may just have picked the wrong restaurant to visit.If you are looking for the flagship Ottolenghi experience, it is my sense that this one just isn't it. If like me you looked at the menu online and thought: oh, full bar with extensive cocktail list, puddings menu, etc. this must be the one, it just isn't. Most of the dishes are cold preparations or really simply prepared meals without the pizzazz of the Ottolenghi touch. \u00a0We were so disappointed by the menu altogether, and afterwards, as we lamented our culinary downer in our hotel, we looked again at the other menus. The Spitalfields location appears to be the one doing the larger, more interesting composed dishes. Take a look at that menu - I think we would have been happier had we gone there. To be frank, dishes like the jicama were really just jicama and salsa on a plate. Not even artfully presented. The burrata was nice, but the accompaniments were too simple to be anything particularly revelatory; the other location seems to present it more artfully. We were told that dishes like the polenta chips were very rich. They weren't. They were just chips with a mayonnaise on the side. Again, nothing artful about it.Our poor server was running around like mad: they need FAR more staff here not to make this a slow experience. She was a whirling dervish and did a great job keeping up, but when you are paying $200 for very basic small plates, you shouldn't have to admire the stamina of your server.Cocktails were nice. Desserts were so very humdrum that we didn't even bother.So, in sum, go to one of the bakeries for breakfast or look at the Spitalfields location for Ottolenghi love if you are in London. \u00a0This one seemed to be an elevated version, but alas, it really fell flat.",

We then just split a bunch of small plates, each of which was delicious. Started with the Burata coated with cardamom seeds that not only added flavor but a nice contrast in texture. The roasted Auvergne was amazing; the mix of flavors just washed over your palette in a cascade of flavors. The polenta fries were also incredible and perfectly cooked. The kale had a nice spicy zest which was the perfect foil to the fries. The final small plate \u00a0was the venison, which was the single best preparation of the dish I have ever had. All washed down with an excellent Sicilian red that had that characteristic \u00a0noise associated with the Mount Edo volcanic soil.In short, of of my best dining experiences in London.",

Nice plus for a very hard to get reservations for dining upstairs!The dining room is sleek, white, and modern. It's a very comfortable dining area. My reason for knocking off a star is because of our service that we had received. Our server seemed a bit put off because we were not ordering any cocktails with our lunch. Prejudging by a server can lead to a not so great dining experience, my friends and I love to eat, also being a restaurant owner I tend to see a bit more than other customers do. A separate check request was given a disapproving attitude. After that we had to request more olive oil for our bread, more still water, dessert from another server and our food bill.The food was outstanding! The valde\u00f3n cheesecake, crispy potatoes with truffle oil, and pork chop with Spring vegetables. No complaints about the quality of food.I wish we had a better service experience to make me want to return on my next visit to London, but there's too many other great restaurants to try.My friends were here the day before almost ordering the same items they ate the time before. That tells me how much they enjoyed the food, they actually complained about the service to management. Too bad- we would've ordered dessert.",

    "text": "We had a nice, but not outstanding, experience at Nopi. The restaurant itself is gorgeous - the design and the vibe is very elegant and feels special, without being ostentatious or pretentious.There is a sizable and creative cocktail menu, so we started with a couple of cocktails, along with the truffle polenta chips. The cocktails were excellent, and the polenta chips, which come with a very subtle garlic aioli, are outstanding. I kind of wish we had ordered more of them.There is a section of the menu called \"Mains\", but instead we opted for a handful of small plates. I initially thought we'd need 7-8 small plates to make a meal, but our waiter guided us to a smaller number (maybe five or six), and I'm very grateful for it. We did find room for dessert, but we were extremely satisfied after that number of plates.The standout dishes for us were the lavosh with burnt spring onion dip, the roast aubergine with yoghurt and pickled lemon, the cheesecake with pickled beets and almonds. I ordered the pork belly with pepper chutney, and when I tried cutting into it, it was pretty dry and tough (hard to cut through with a knife). I asked the waiter if that was expected, and he said \"no, definitely not\" and whisked it off the table. A manager came to the table next to apologize, but explained that all of the pork belly dishes came from the same piece of pork belly, so they would all be the same, and he suggested I order something different. On one hand, I felt like this was a fair way to handle the situation, but on the other hand felt a little bit like it was my fault, as if I was a customer who would never be pleased. I ordered the mackerel instead, which was fine.For dessert we had the apple ginger bread trifle and the coffee and pecan financiers. The financiers were amazing. They come with a maple cream that I am currently installing a dispenser for in my kitchen. I'm kidding, but it is delicious.I'm a little soured on the pork belly situation (which would be a good name for a band), but hope to be back again to try again.",

    "text": "There are places in London that try to be American (specifically NYC). Most fail miserably. I'm pretty sure NOPI isn't trying to be as Upper East Side Manhattan, but it really, really is. I walked in for lunch yesterday and could have sworn I was sitting somewhere between Madison and Park in the upper 70's. The space is done in all-white subway tiles and with brass deco fixtures. Very New York. The service? Also very New York. Without prompting, we were presented with a bottle of tap water. Our glasses were refilled again and again by the attentive--but not in an annoying way--staff. The clientele? Very \"Ladies Who Lunch.\" At 1:30 the place was pretty much full. I counted only three male diners. The food? Well, this was kind of the downfall. It's not cheap by any means. The small plate (meant for sharing, of course) entrees run between 9 and 12GBP a plate. We had five dishes, dessert, two glasses of wine, and coffee, and it came to just under 80GBP. Most everything was underseasoned, and there were a couple odd combinations. We tried the lamb meatballs, beef brisket croquettes, a cured white fish (hake maybe?), the seared scallops, and the baked blue cheese cheesecake. The lamb meatballs were served in a yogurt-based sauced that reminded me of a stroganoff... and then they topped it with pomegranate. Outside of needing salt, and the addition of the pomegranate seeds, the dish was not bad. The cured fish also fell into this category, as did the scallops. The standouts were the croquettes with a side of Asian slaw that was really lovely. I also liked the cheesecake, although it was more of a quiche, than a cheesecake. However, it was tasty with its side of mushrooms. For dessert we had the Sultana financiers, which were good, but nothing special. The barista came to check on our coffee, as they were training someone new, and she wanted to make sure it wasn't burnt. That was a nice touch for sure.Also beware of the toilets if you're claustrophobic. They've tried to counteract the size of the room by completely covering it in angled mirrors. What they really accomplished looks like it came straight out of Al Pacino's loo in Scarface. Break out the rolled twenty and the bag of... well, you know... Anyway, I can't say this is one of my favourite places for lunch. For the price, there are much better deals. However, I would imagine this would be a nice date spot in the evenings. The staff and the surroundings outshine many of the dishes at this point. Hopefully this will change over the next few months.",

This was a special birthday for my husband so I wanted to make sure everything went smoothly and it did. \u00a0We started off with a nice medium bodied bottle of French red wine and nibbled on this eggpant appetizer with pomegranate seeds and lavash , which was so delicious, the flavors came together so well. \u00a0There are options of getting mains or sharing a bunch of small plates. \u00a0We opted to do a tasting of small plates and ordered:Burrata with toasted coriander seeds and peach with honey. \u00a0I thought this was such a yummy and unique flavor.Figs with goat cheese and sweet potato- Ths was actually quite nice as well -- I probably would lean towards this rather than the burrata if I were forced to make a choice. Double cooked chicken-SOOO moist and delicious! \u00a0The flavors were awesome and even if you didnt eat the skin, you could taste the flavors, an indication to me that they really marinated the chicken.Roast sirloin- This was the only dish I wasnt in love with. It was served too rare for my taste but I also dont really eat beef so I'm not a good judge. \u00a0My husband thought it was fine but preferred the chicken.And of course to round out the evenign, we had some great dessert, which didnt sound super appetizing but was sooo good--peanut ice cream with toffee and chocolate. \u00a0heaven on a plate. No seriously. \u00a0We enjoyed that with a port, and ended our night a little heavier from the drinking and eatin but so much happier and fulfilled. \u00a0 I would go here agian for a special occasion, but clearly this is not an every day eating establishment.",

NOPI is an exception. Food is tasty and high quality and the restaurant is very nice. Yes the place is crowded because Ottolenghi is very well known. But if you forget about it and concentrate on the food, it is quite good. Unfortunately, \u00a0vegetarian options are limited in Nopi, although the ones offered are very good.",

    "text": "What can I say? I actually thought this place was great. Maybe a bit on the pricey side, but it is central London and big-name chefs of Ottolenghi fame. Your savory dishes come in 3 categories: vegetables, fish, and meat. Those are three categories I like, so the menu suited me quite well.As part of a group with 6 people, we were able to try basically everything on the menu. Some real highlights of the evening were the cocktails (which I did not try), the greens with yogurt sauce, the pork cheeks, and the pomegranate with lamb. The menu changes very frequently, so you may have a totally different selection depending on when you go.I was too stuffed to try dessert, but apparently the chocolate ganache was amazing.Gluten-free notes: The menu changes daily. Ask them to take a menu into the kitchen and mark up what you can or can't eat. They were happy to do this. I was able to eat about half of the vegetable and meat dishes, all of the fish dishes, and about half of the desserts. Definitely didn't go hungry here!",

Small plates for double the price of a regular spot, then tack on the conversion rate. Ay mama!! Me and a friend split four plates and dessert and had a couple of drinks. My half was $72. Remember I said TAPAS which I split with my friend. Supposedly some big name chef who is quite meticulous in preparing the food. Nice to know there was lots of love put in the dishes and the price tag to follow.We sat downstairs at the communal table (not so much a fan) but it was a nice feel. The bathroom is crazy! You have to check it out. Mirrors everywhere!Also, if it's on the menu, you must try the financiers....SO GOOD.",

The room is gorgeous, and has a great natural light in the day due to a skylight. This is a place you can bring anyone - your mom, your grandma, and your trendy (or non trendy) friends.

    "text": "For more and photos please visit my blog: hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  I usually miss new restaurant openings and go there about 2 years after everyone else. But not this time, mind you! There are two current bloggers' favourites, Spuntino (related to Polpo and Polpetto) and Ottolenghi's chic sister NOPI. Spuntino I'll probably visit in 2013, but Hooray! I have made it to NOPI and I am so glad I did. Most of you will know about the Israel-born Yotam Ottolenghi who has taken London by storm. We are talking bold combination of clean flavours taking its inspiration from Mediterranean cuisines with added influences from all around the world. These delicacies you can enjoy at (or rather take away from) Ottotlenghi joints in several locations all around London. But now the team behind Ottolenghi has transferred its philosphy and delicious cooking to a restaurant. NOPI (which apparently means North of Picadilly (??)) has just opened a couple of months ago in Warwick Street, a small side street just parallel to Regent's Street, and has seems to have won over even the toughest critics. (Independent, Guardian). When you enter Nopi the first thing you take in is the clean atmosphere \u00a0white tile walls, wooden furniture, brass lamps \u00a0and the smell of truffles. You know you have arrived at a good place. NOPI is all about sharing. Who knows me is aware that I really don't believe in the concept of 'your' or 'my' dish (sometimes not fully appreciated by my respective dinner companions who very selfishly want to enjoy what they have ordered all for themselves). NOPI is fully on my side here! In the menu it is stated that 3 savoury plates per person are recommended. You can choose from the 'vegetarian', 'meat' or 'fish' section of the pleasantly compact menu. We shared 5 dishes between us which was more than enough as the dishes were bigger than I had anticipated. The dessert was then eaten more out of curiosity than of need. The concept of NOPI's cooking seems easy \u00a0you take a good quality main ingredient and combine it with 3-4 flavours (different herbs, citrus fruits, chili) to make it into a unique and hugely pleasant culinary experience. Of the 6 dishes we ordered, 5 were superb and also the last one was, if not quite the level of the others, still far above average. I loved the Burrata, blood orange, coriander seeds (12). A luscious soft lump of mozzarella, silky on the outside and creamy within doesn't have much taste on its own. Combined with the roast coriander seeds generously sprinkled on top, the slices of blood orange and the small leaves of the spicy globe basil it resulted in a flavour and texture explosion. A little bit less dramatic but none the less enjoyable were the Braised carrots, mung beans, smoked labneh (10). The subtle flavour of the garden carrots worked lovely against the background of the mung beans (which very much tasted like lentils in my opinion) and the salty cheese gave just a little bit of kick to this otherwise mellow plate of food. We only went for one fish dish, Grilled hake kebabs, lemon pickle, yoghurt (10), and this was my least favourite. In fact when I tried the fish burger by itself I was really disappointed, it was dry and did not taste of much. But by then I had realised how NOPI works, so I loaded onto my fork a bit of fish cake, some of herbs (chervil, dill, and some various others), a slice of lime pickle and some of the sauce and suddenly, when the flavours came all together is my mouth, the dish went from one to three-dimensional. I loved loved loved the Roasted beef sirloin, baby fennel, pecorino (12) which was the source of the lingering truffle smell in the restaurant. Cold pieces of perfectly cooked beef were covered in thin slices of fennel (which reminds me again of how much I like fennel, I am surprised it is not used more often) and the supporting and not at all overpowering flavour of truffel oil. This is a must order dish. My dinner companion's favourite was the Twice-cooked baby chicken, kafir lime salt, chilli sauce (8). The chicken was superb. Beautifully tender in a thick sweet sauce it worked beautifully with the kafir lime salt. I was not keen on the chili sauce though, the chicken didn't need it in my opinion. Almost exploding at this stage the waiter was still able to persuade us to try the Cardamom rice pudding (6.5). I have a real weakness for rice pudding and this one just reinforced my opinion. More fluid than pudding consistency, this dessert combined the oriental flavours of cardamon and rose water with crunchy pieces of pistachio. Very scrumptious indeed. The service was efficient and amiable without being annoying and all the waiters were smiling a lot. If NOPI gives them a plate of their food once in a while I would be smiling too Now the downside NOPI is not cheap. None of the dishes costs more than 12 pounds but it adds up, particularly when you eat 3 dishes each. The wine menu",

    "text": "After a long enduring battle amongst the throngs of tourist on Regent Street and the many stores we decided to step into (as if these very stores didn't exist back in NYC!), we arrived at Nopi without any expectations. For starters we ordered 2 dishes the organic prawns and the roasted pumpkin. The organic prawns was a immediate introduction to what the rest of our dining journey would be, ABSOLUTE FLAVOR OVERLOAD to the taste buds! For the main course we ordered the smoked ricotta and the 28 day dry aged sirloin. I was a bit hesitant at first with the additional ingredients for the sirloin since I normally prefer just a dash of salt and pepper on aged sirloin. If I can steal this recipe I would without any hesitation! The meat was perfectly cooked at medium and the combination of the anchovy butter (I normally hate anchovy), king oyster mushroom, and alfalfa made the combination as perfect as the 92 Olympic Dream Team! This dish is definitely now on my list of must haves before crocking! To cap off the meal we ordered the banana brioche for dessert which basically has put Nopi forever engrained into my brain when I think of London. I will definitely be back the next time I cross the pond!",

Being aware of many of his adorable dishes from the cookbooks, the moment I knew about my pending trip to London, I made a reservation weeks ahead of time as a spontaneous visit would not have had a chance to be successful. NOPI is one of several locations and very central, and by the way not excessively priced. The interior design was elegant modern, hip and yet warmly welcoming as if it was a table at the home kitchen. In fact, the lower level was exactly that with 2 very large shared table right next to the open kitchen and the backwall shelves with Ottolenghi merchandise. The noise level was significant, making conversations a bit of a challenge. But in the end, there was no time to talk, as one had to indulge into the beautifully and oh so delicious dishes. With all items to be shared, the waiter recommended 3 smaller items per person whereby a main dish would count as two. That was to the point and provided a nice tour through the menu list and still left space for a dessert. Burrata with Peaches, Roasted Beetroot, Mizo Glazed Hake, Crushed New Potatoes (P.S. glad they don't offer old ones), Twice Cooked Half Chicken were superbly done. The Strawberry Mess was not a mess at all to say the least. Great dinner!",

Our London friends took us to NOPI for lunch - overall an excellent experience! Though pricy, the ambiance is what you may expect, and the service excellent. We were blown away by some of the dishes, and others we liked though were not impressed to the same degree. We loved the roasted aubergine (eggplant) with almond yogurt and beef bavette wjth shiitake ketchup and morning glory. I would say the morning glory was over salted by itself though if you pair with the beef it was perfect. Other dishes we tried that were good (but not as extraordinary) include lavosh, couchette (zucchini) and manouri fritters, spiced potato cake, and Cumbrian pork chops.",

    "text": "Surprisingly underwhelming. Lured by an available 6pm reservation and an abundance of stellar reviews, my boyfriend and I were excited to dine at Nopi. The interior is contemporary yet classic, with a primarily white and gold decor scheme, and romantic low lighting. Elegant, but still casual-no dress code. The staff were all genuinely friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable of the menu. Our waiter recommended a unique wine that we really enjoyed-I cannot remember the name, but you will find no shortage of wine here. Their wine and craft cocktail list is outstanding.Unfortunately, the food was a different story. The complimentary bread starter was overly chewy, with a thick crust and served only with a side of olive oil. It needed balsamic vinegar or something else to flavor it, as it was quite bland on its own. The menu offers a concise selection of Mediterranean fusion dishes, separated into 4 categories-Nibbles, Starters/Dishes To Share, Mains, and Sides. I was pleased to find an abundance of vegetarian options which could easily be modified to be made vegan.We started with the Roasted Beetroot, which is served with a miso yoghurt, sesame, and garlic. The beetroot was cooked perfectly, but the marinade was much too salty. Beets are naturally salty, and the addition of several other salty toppings just did not work in this dish. My boyfriend got the popular Burrata with blood orange starter and was equally unimpressed. He barely touched his main, the Duck, saying it was inedibly salty. I got the Chickpea pancake, which was just okay. The pancake itself was not good. The only prominent flavor was curry powder, and it was slightly burnt on the bottom. I enjoyed the fresh salad and pickled chili on top, but the dressing was overwhelmingly, again, salty. The flavors were wildly non-cohesive, so much so that I separated the components onto different plates on the table. It is a shame that everything had to be over salted and over seasoned, because the base ingredients were undoubtedly high quality. \u00a3120 felt wildly overpriced for this mediocre meal. We will not be back.",

I came here for brunch, and simply had one of the most well-prepared and comforting meals in my life.For brunch, we ordered:- Shakshuka (braised eggs, piquante tomato sauce, smoked labneh). Perfectly seasoned and cooked. I've eaten a lot of this dish before, and this had to be in my top 2.- Black rice, coconut milk, banana, mango. Not overly sweet and well balanced. Would have loved some more mango in the dish, but can't complain too much.- Hot Chocolate. Velvety goodness.- Bacon with honey. After eating so much British \"bacon\" for the past few days, you cannot imagine how delicious real bacon was.One of the best things about NOPI is that it has earlier opening hours than other similar places, so for those of you who have to travel in the morning, I definitely recommend dropping by this place. Just don't forget to make a reservation - you won't regret it!",

The vegetables you get are likelier to be better (i.e. from a local farmer and not from a large supplier, etc).. So my rating is 4.5 starsTrying to distangle that, I think that the food is well prepared. \u00a0I only ordered vegatarian things not because I am but because I have in my head that he has made a name in this area... \u00a0In a nutshell, warm stuff is way better than the cold items. \u00a0The cold items are prepared well in advanced and is set in a buffet like table. \u00a0The warm items are pretty good. \u00a0I would recommend the cheese cake dish, the falafel and the basic chips. \u00a0Didnt like the crudite and the burrata.",

We ordered from the nibbles menu \"Mixed seed lavosh, burnt spring onion dip,\" from the vegetables menu \"Burrata, loquats, verjus, coriander seeds,\" and \"Chargrilled Everleigh farm asparagus, miso tahini, poppy seeds.\" As a main, we shared \"Chickpea pancake, spiced peas, tomato, picked chili, yuzu.\" All of the food was finely prepared and beautifully presented. I prefer sweet wines over dry, and could not find one that suited my palate. The waitress, Tes, asked if \"everything was good,\" and I expressed my wish for a sweeter wine. I have yet to find a Riesling in London. Tes was extremely patient with me (and I tried really hard not to test it, as I felt like I was too fussy already). She brought two sample glasses of what she thought were sweeter white wines. While those didn't satisfy me either, I expressed my gratitude to her (and here) and via the Ottelenghi info/contact e-mail address. Clearly, the staff are trained to cater to any customer's discriminating palate. I would return to NOPI or his eponymous restaurants any day I am in London.

Burrata Cheese: This was kind of gimmicky. Cheese came out presented beautifully but lacked the texture and quality that Burrata cheese is known for. I'm unsure where they source the cheese but this was certainly one of the worst versions of this meal I have ever had.Eggplant: This is one of their signature dishes but when we ordered it it looked like something that had be premade earlier in the day and was sitting in a fridge waiting to be ordered. It certainly was visually pleasing but lacked any complex flavours and was only a \"single layer\" of taste.Trout: Was overly salted and incredibly fishy. I don't believe they had sourced the freshest fist for this place on this occasion. The service also lacked something. Food arrived prior to the wine and we had to hunt down a waiter to finally get some delivered. Had this been a $100 meal for two people it would have been acceptable however at $300 for two people I was thoroughly unimpressed and would not return. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn'the amazing culinary experience I was expecting.",

Otto-legend-i does it again and again!The most esculent food.The most sophisticated decor.The most sought-after location.The most gracious staff.My dining experience here was nothing short of perfect. The menu is designed to be tapas-style, whereby sharing dishes are sorted under meat, fish, vegetarian and dessert headings, with about 3-4 small plates recommended per person (so if you come with enough people, the more you get to sample!).As every morsel of food emerged from the open kitchen, gratefully onto our communal timber table in the casual pantry-dining area downstairs, disbelief spread as no-one could fathom the possibility of the next dish tasting superior to the previous. But it happened. Again, and again.I could never shun anything consumed here, but to torture myself, and select the favourites... the most memorable of the elongated-shortlist would be Valde\u00f3n cheesecake, the pork belly with pear, the banana-leaf wrapped gurnard but the roasted aubergine absolutely stole the whole show.The contemporary retrofit works very successfully. The nautically-themed brass detailing provides beautifully cast coat hooks, light fixtures and ironmongery alike. A trip to the bathroom is a must just the experience a most fascinating hall of mirrors- congratulations if you can find your way back to the restaurant through the correct door on first attempt!",

    "text": "An exceptional place with exceptional food. We were looking for a place to have dinner on New Year Eve in our first visit with my daughters to London. We wanted something special and we got it. They were serving a special menu for the night, but I am sure it is representative of the quality you would get there any night. They were very accommodating in allowing my two daughters to order a la carte and thus not pay full price for their dinners. The service was impeccable and the sommelier was wonderful with suggesting wines by the glass that we loved. Here are just some entree title to give you an idea:Burrata, clementine, coriander seedsValdeon cheescake, pickled beetroot, hazelnut, thyme honey (amazing)Sea bream, fresh coconut, pickled ginger, mint, peanutsTwice-cooked baby chicken, lemon myrtle salt, chili sauceRoast sirloin, spinach and asparagus, truffle vinegrette, Belper Knolle (exceptional)Don't know what else to say. Worth a trip from another country and met my New Year's expectations.",

Phenomenal start when we showed up, getting us nuts and olives to snack on and a drink menu right away. Service got a bit slow at our table but not a big deal. Had some great deserts to finish the meal. Cakes with toffee cream were probably the best of the three deserts. Hi plate mousse with pop rocks was unique and delish.",

    "text": "I go to this restaurant every time I visit London, which is basically every month (just so that you understand my dedication). Reservations can be a bit tough at times but this place is definitely worth it. I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on the meat dishes. We usually end up ordering just about every vegetarian starter and it works out perfectly. I also prefer getting a bunch of starters to share vs. getting a main. They switch their menu every 3-4 months but the burrata starter is my favorite and has always been on the menu. The drinks are great as well. Try the grapefruit and lychee cooler and the kumquat and passionfruit. Bathroom is pretty interesting - make sure to check it out...which is pretty easy after having some of their yummy drinks.",

The real EPIPHANY of the evening was the herbal side salad with fresh dill and WFI...mint omigosh the combination was amazing and it would seem to be recreatable home. The atmosphere and staff were cool and the wine was great, but again even though the orderer didn't need any help the waiter had zero insight into what would shine with what. I realize this isn't a 4GBP place but how hard is it to throw Wine for Dummies at your employees or give them a color coded diagram to memorize. One would think some knowledge would be unavoidable given your working milieu, but I guess I'm off base.Anyhow, go there!",

    "text": "I came here on my birthday and had a delicious dinner. This is true, down to earth, honest to goodness deliciousness. Service was excellent, with still and sparkling tap water offered for free and replenished frequently. To our questions about ingredients, our server either knew the answers or found out quickly. Our six dishes came quite quickly, but not all at once, and we never felt rushed. Moreover, our server made an extra effort to try to find out a retailer where we might be able to buy the wine that we chose (the \"Biancadicaselle\"). Our server displayed the right balance of being attentive without being obsequious throughout the meal.The food itself was very, very good. The vegetables used were seasonal (swedes, carrots, grated brussel sprouts, beetroot, greens) and were supplemented by spices, yogurts/cheese, and savoury sauces. In general, the food was perhaps a little salty, but as full-time vegetarians with a seasonal-veg commitment, we are accustomed to blandness by the end of a long winter so perhaps others would not think anything was amiss.Portion sizes were fine--we ordered six dishes between the two of us (guys) and we actually felt full before the end of the evening.",

Although we have eaten at Ottolenghi before we were not really sure what to expect but were largely pleased with what was on offer - a series of tapas dishes which show ingredients and culinary influences from around the world.Some dishes were a little over powering, perhaps suffering from one ingredient or influence too many. \u00a0However, others were an absolute delight. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the roasted aubergine which was served with black garlic, harissa and pine nuts. \u00a0The aubergine was absolutely stunning and its accompaniments complimented rather than detracted from its smokey flavour. \u00a0Another great dish was the gurnard cooked in a banana leaf and served with a pineapple sambal. \u00a0The fish was perfectly cooked and its delicate spicing was a perfect foil for the sambal.Somewhat at odds with the modernity of the food however, is the ambiance of NOPI which is a little too clinical. \u00a0Perhaps this is a reaction to the organised chaos which makes Ottolenghi such fun. However, something, for me at least, wasn't quite right. \u00a0This said, the staff are nothing but pleasant and were extremely helpful explaining some of the more esoteric ingredients on the menu.Special mention should go to the wine list which is quite exceptional. \u00a0I would be very happy to spend a fortune working through all of the interesting bottles on offer and this would be a great place to take someone who was really interested in wine.",

The waiter recommended six items between two, and we had eight. A little too much, but it's only too much of a good thing. Each was 5-8 pounds. The best were the cauliflower with ricotta and raisins and the sweet potatoes with goat's cheese and figs... oh, and the lavash with aubergine-fig-goat curd dip. mmmmm.We ordered a fresh tomato salad and didn't like it as much - not that it wasn't great, but that in the presence of so many delicious foods it was only ok. They didn't charge us and said it was a new item and would be reconsidered for the next menu.We also ordered the non-alco cocktails - basically really fancy juices - and although pricey, they were mmm mmm good.

    "text": "Probably the worst service i received in london - as we didn't get two items that we ordered (both of which were our more interesting picks). As the waiter did not tell us in a timely manner, we did not have a good balance of hot and cold dishes, saucy and dry, meaty and full of vegetable, which might have negatively impact our dining experience. As such, we didn't think that the dishes were interesting enough or well balanced enough. What we got (about 7 different dishes shared by 3) were good, but didn't warrant a repeat visit. There were also no standouts.A few tips for those who are going to try this place:- make sure you're seated upstairs and are not rushed. They may have agreed to accomodate you, but tell you that you have to leave at a certain time - go another time, you need time to enjoy the meal as service is slow.- they will tell you that you need a main plus two starters, i personally think an average eater would be happy with a starter and a main- those familiar with asian food or indonesian cuisine (the chilli!) --- The twice cooked chicken and chili sauce is a common asian dish. It's almost like a mix of ayam kalasan or chinese five spiced chicken (though not sure if its 5 spice, it might be just sweet soy sauce). It's delicious but also 3x its usual price. Worth a try for those who have no idea what i'm talking about. Not sure what part of this dish is mediterranean.",

As told by the menu, we ordered 6 dishes in total for the two of us, which turned out to be just the right amount. The food is delivered \"as it's done\" according to the friendly and knowledgable waitress. At one point I was concerned we'd run out of table space, but thankfully they'd obviously timed everything carefully.We ordered a \u00a340 quid bottle of red, which I thought was rather disappointing for the price point.The dishes were delivered in menu order, which as we'd ordered two veg, two fish, and two meat, ended up in a rather suitable pattern.Burrata with peach and fennel seeds: delicious, the mozarella-ball-like cheese perfectly unguent and creamy, and the anise setting it off nicelyValdeon cheesecake (yes, we had two cheeses): probably the highlight, a great depth of flavour and a perfect consistency, with the beetroots a great companionSoftshell crab: Never ordered this before, but I liked it an awful lot. Came coated in breadcrumbs and was crabby without being overly soOtak-otak: this was some perfectly-cooked seafood (squid amongst others) in a lovely coconut sauce, all wrapped up inside a banana leaf (or something like it)Rabbit pastilla: AKA rabbit pie. I've always suspected I don't really like rabbit, and whilst this was obviously well-executed, it turns out I'm right.Beef sirloin: this was delivered almost carpaccio-style with cheese flaked on top. I wasn't totally sold on this one, I must admit.We couldn't resist dessert. We chose the doughnuts with berries (delicious) and the kaffir lime meringue (equally so, we argued for quite some time about which was better). Even better, on asking the waitress for a drink recommendation to match, she steered towards a glass of dessert wine (the cheapest one) for one, and an excellent sake for the other. I'm not much of a sake buff, but this was really very nice.",

So while I was in London on vacation, I picked this place as a splurge meal. There were three of us, and we were at a communal table downstairs since I'd waited so long to make a reservation. But the atmosphere was still cool, since you're looking right at the kitchen (you can't see much, though, and our food still came from upstairs?). We split a few different dishes, which is what the restaurant recommends. We ordered the truffled polenta chips, baby chicken, grilled quail, seared scallops, and courgette fritters. They also brought us the Ottolenghi spiced nuts while we waited for our table, which were one of our favorite parts of the meal. The quail was also really good, and the chicken and scallops were fine, but nothing else was that great. It may be that I'm just not used to this type of food, but if I were going to splurge on a meal I'd go somewhere else.The bathroom is really cool, though - a highlight of our dinner. :)",

The manager was very nice and after a short wait, we got a table. \u00a0The cocktails were excellent. My companion enjoyed the old fashioneds \u00a0(but I don't like vanilla or rooibos flavors). I loved the Banana and Cardamom cocktail. Frankly, I think I would have been happy to just drink a few of those and eat the spiced nuts. \u00a0Note: The nuts weren't hot-spicy, just full-flavored. If you have any interest in saving room for dessert - 3 small plates would be enough for two. We had five and were too stuffed to consider dessert. The fish, the lamb, and the aubergine were the best food choices we tried. They weren't large portions, but delicious and filling. I liked the toasted coriander seeds, but found the nectarine sauce with the burrata too cloying; however, my companion thought it was great. Every item we tried demonstrated a deep knowledge of spices and seasoning. While everything was flavorful and delicious, nothing was overpowering. I've seen Ottolenghi cookbooks everywhere and was excited to try one of his restaurants.. After this experience, I doubt I'll be cooking any of these items at home, but I think I'd like to try some of the other restaurants in the group.",

The only disappointment was a beetroot and hazelnut Cheesecake which despite the description came across like a gratin dauphinoise and the prawns in curry sauce which were ok but not brilliant.The desserts were excellent, Mrs E had a Peanut ice-cream and I had Pecan Financiers.All in all a great night and would definitely recommend.",

Finally, I tried the courgette fritters which are mixed with what looked like shallots and manouri, which reminded me of light ricotta. I liked this the least. They were not greasy (good thing) but also flavoured with cardamon which overwhelmed the taste of the dish. \u00a0They were ok but given the waiter called it out as a signature dish, it could have worked a lot harder to gain that praise. Overall, some very nice, simple food. \u00a0I was expecting a bit more wow factor given how expensive it was (\u00a340 for three starters and a glass of wine) but it was good afternoon treat, albeit lousy value for money. \u00a0The scallops made the difference as well as the service.",

I had been very much looking forward to trying out, as I had heard so many good things about it. And fortunately, despite having high hopes for this place, my expectations were not only met, but even succeeded!The thing I loved about this place is definitely not the price tag...it's the fact that the chefs can do so many wonderful things to vegetables. Think about it this way: usually, you get vegetables as a side dish and they come dressed up in clothes from Old Navy or Monsoon. Here at NOPI, the vegetables are the stars and they undergo a transformation by folks like Vivian Westwood or Alexander McQueen.The best way to sample as many dishes as possible, is to come with about three or four people and every person chooses between 2 and 3 dishes....you must make a reservation, especially on a busy weekend night or else you either might not be seated at all, or you might be waiting for a looooong time.And last but not least - do thy out their bathroom...it's quite a different experience as well ;-)",

I had the lamb chops for my entree which appeared more rare than to my liking but was actually pretty perfect. Our group of three ended up with an appetizer, entrees, drinks and dessert which came out to \u00a3160 but everyone was super satisfied with their meal. I would definitely go back if I was a local.",

    "text": "I love Ottolenghi. I love the deli, I love the sit-down restaurant in Islington, I love the cookbooks. All of it. So I was very excited to finally be eating at NOPI, which is often billed as Ottolenghi's upscale counterpart. The food was, not surprisingly, very good. Everything was fresh with interesting flavor combinations that worked very well, as is this chef group's signature. The bathrooms are something out of a nightmare. I don't even understand the purpose of designing it that way. It's a horrible hall of mirrors that I would have gotten stuck in after a couple more drinks. The music was also awful, as they were playing some sort of trying-to-be-hip up-tempo beats that just...no. Not when I'm trying to enjoy dinner. Especially not a nice dinner of small plates. The wine was delicious. Our server kind of ignored our table for stretches of time, which was surprising because she was very attentive to others. I think it was just a busy time or we seemed lower maintenance or something. We ate in the ground floor dining room, but could see the long tables in the basement overlooking the kitchen being much cozier and a nicer experience. What it comes down to is this: skip NOPI and just go to Ottolenghi. You'll have to book further in advance to get a table, but the food is on par if not better, more reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is much more fitting the type of meal you'll have. The only thing saving this place from a three star review is the quality of the food.",

    "text": "What can I say about Nopi? If you're a fan of Ottolenghi then you're sure to like Nopi. The look is different. Where Ottolenghi is all minimalist white Nopi is more modern blonde wood. I like the coat hooks here. They like hangers that go directly on the wall. The hanging coats look like people facing the wall. It's funny and creepy at the same time. Similar to Nopi I recommend a reservation. I'm not sure you can get a walkin seat. I'm not sure if they even have any. I came in at lunch and they were booked until 2 PM. I was able to snag a reservation for 3 that night though. Unfortunately the rest of my party bailed but I forged on by myself. They were nice about changing the reservation and suggested I sit at the bar - more sociable to sit and chat with the bartenders than to sit by myself at a communal table. Although they do large plates I wanted to try as many different dishes as possible so went with the recommended 3 dishes which may have been a good recommendation for a bigger or hungrier person but was too much food for me. Perhaps I shouldn't have listened to those other reviewers who complained about portions because I made sure to eat all my complimentary bread. I ended up taking half of two dishes home so I could have dessert (you didn't seriously think I would pass up dessert here did you?).I took the bartenders recommendations which included: * valdeon cake - the fluffiest creamiest savory cheesecake ever, 5 stars * mackerel and green grape salsa with tobiko - nice for mackerel people, this dish doesn't disguise the mackerel, 4 stars * twice baked chicken - I didn't quite understand why this chicken was so special, 3 stars * tofu-fa with papaya young coconut and ginger syrup - a dessert that was light, refreshing and not too sweet, very unusual flavors with the tofu-fa, 5 starsDrinks were very very good. I had the saffron chase and anise/apple. I especially liked the anise/apple.Total was \u00a370 for 3 dishes, dessert and 2 drinks - including 20% tip. For just a little more \u00a3\u00a3 my meal could have been split between 2 people.The biggest difference with Nopi are the customers. Lots of groups at Nopi celebrating who-knows-what. While I was eating at the bar a group was mingling next to me - older man with hitler mustache dressed for the opera, older guy who looked like a retired rock star, a tweedy professor and an amazoness in bright red. Soho! Gotta love it!",

I'm not sure if they've entered a \"summer surge\" period or what, but the prices seemed to jump about 20 percent from a few months ago, while the portion sizes dropped 20 percent, and fairly aloof service to boot.

We ordered almost All the signature dishes - twice cooked baby chicken, scallops (pork belly, apple, yuzu sauce), fish, and many vegetable sides, including the aubergine (eggplant) signature and burrata with nectarines , coriander and white balsamic. it was a gastronomic field day!! each dish stood on it's own, and was delicious. We became victims of our gluttony, however, when the 5 sides and 4 mains had somewhat of a collision, and at least for a couple at the table, caused a taste traffic jam...(I, however, enjoyed every minute). it's a meal we won't forget soon, but may pare back the gluttonous ordering next time. Most of the 6 of us enjoyed thoroughly and would consider it a signature meal to be re-experienced as soon as possible !!! (hope we get back to family and this restaurant in London soon!!)",

    "text": "Ottolenghi is good, but Nopi is better, in my opinion. I managed to make a booking for the downstairs communal table and I really like the elegant table setting. Nopi serves small dishes, which I love, because I can sample so many different flavors at one meal. The menu here seems to be changing very frequently if not daily. The burrata, blood orange, coriander seeds and lavender oil offered very unexpected flavor, but I thought the taste of burrata was masked by the lavender a bit. i prefer the unadulterated taste of burrata more. Then came my favorite dish - roasted sweet potato with burnt aubergine yoghurt and roasted seeds. The genius of the dish was the strong smoky flavor of the aubergine yoghurt: it makes a vegetarian dish taste so satisfying. Another of the highlight was, to my surprise, twice-cooked baby chicken. I am not a big fan of chicken, but I want to lick the meat of the bone of this chicken. It was cooked Asian style with sweet soy sauce and the meat was just super flavorful and juicy. We also had octopus, pork belly and venison, and they were all pretty good as well. I love the clever usage of yogurt and nuts in different dishes. The potions here were small, but after 7 dishes my friend and i were too full to get desserts. \u00a0 I will definitely come back again to try new items on the menu.",

    "text": "The food spoke volumes! My mother was in town from America and has two of their cookbooks at home- Jerusalum and Ottolenghi. After doing research and finding no tables available for Ottolenghi we decided to try Nopi since it had so many raving reviews. I was able to get us in downstairs for a 9.30pm meal. We arrived at 9.20pm. Table was not ready so we had to stand at the bar. They brought us an amazing homemade nuts and fabulous olives. At 9.55pm I went to the front desk to see how much longer our table would be.. which was annoying as we had been standing for 35 minutes and it was 25 minutes past our reservation time. I was a bit put off by the service as we where waiting around for forever. We finally where seated at 10pm downstairs on a crowded table, it took me another 20 minutes to flag a waiter down to ask if he could take our order. We where never greeted by our waiter when we sat down and I flagged him down the first time and he said he would be with us a moment. 20 minutes passed and I had to flag him down again to say please take our order! ( note: its 10.30 and we have been waiting an hour by now). We where never checked up on throughout our meal, never asked if we wanted another drink. For a top restaurant I wouldn't expect to have to beg a waiter to take our orders or fight for attention such as extra olive oil (we had to ask twice). The food was amazing, the service shocking. The chicken was crispy and flavorful... I cannot complain about any dishes as they where all top notch 5 star quality. The head of house eventually came down towards the end of the meal and took 2 drinks of our bill for making us wait for over 30 minutes for our table(if she didn't I would have been more upset as I felt we deserved some type of apology), which was a nice gesture. I am just still a bit shocked at the lack of attention we received downstairs from the waiters. Waiters are supposed to follow up and make sure you have everything you need, we shouldn't have to fight to flag someone down for 10-15 minutes especially if you are paying high prices for the meal. They are obviously understaffed. I would say 5 star for food, 2 star for service.. this is why I am giving a three star rating. Hopefully they solve their staffing issues and get more staff and ones that are trained to pay more attention to their clients.",

NOPI is similiar to his restaurant Ottolenghi in that the flavors are bold and vibrant yet comforting and delicious. The food is sourced locally, as much as possible, and it is fresh and free of preservatives and artificial coloring. Inventive seasonal dishes are offered with both Mediterranean and Asian influences. This restaurant has community tables, similar to Ottolenghi on the lower level, but there are smaller and more formal tables on the main floor. Reservations are recommended for pre-theatre and dinner. Breakfast and lunch are also served at this location. The restaurant has a bar and is beautifully decorated with white and brass which creates a nice atmosphere and fun vibe. I have all of Yotum's cookbooks which are also fabulous. (There will be new releases soon!) The restaurant has a wide-ranging wine list and a fun cocktail menu. I had the \"Saffron Chase\" which comprised of Chase gin, champagne, elderflower liquor, and saffron...very refreshing. Dinner (\"Sharing Plates\") included Burrata, peach, coriander seeds, and plum wine; twice-cooked baby chicken, lemon myrtle salt, and chili sauce; beef sirloin, black garlic, salt baked avocado; and truffle polenta chips with Parmesan and garlic aioli. I selected the coffee and pecan financiers with maple cream from the \"Pudding Menu\" for dessert. Delicious vegetarian options are available. \u00a0ottolenghi.co.uk",

I booked a table for three at least a month in advance for a table on the top floor and got a table in the middle of the room. Me and my company went for a tapas feel of a dinner and ordered mainly different sides. The dishes that stood out from the many vegetarian sides were the Valdeon cheesecake and Pork belly dishes. We also got complimentary bread and olive oil but quite sparingly and had to ask for more during the course of dinner. I also asked if they had any other types of bread like they did in the Ottolenghi in Liverpool Street, with a mix of dark and light bread, but they sadly didn't. I was very impressed with the warm cheesecake made from Spanish cheese but since I don't eat meat never tried the pork. My company liked the pork dish but said it wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. All in all it is a lovely restaurant but I rather choose the Ottolenghi in Liverpool Street to be honest.",

    "text": "We got here at 10:20am, for a Sunday 10am breakfast reservation. On our way to the Ottolenghi restaurant, they had called us to confirm that we were still on to meet the reservation because we were running late. The service was superior; the food came out quickly, everything looked, felt, smelled and tasted impeccable.We started with the best tasting croissant in London. English breakfast liquor tea by the side.The bagel with Hansen & Lydersen smoked salmon on a bed of wasabi cream was adequately loaded with fish, fresh and bursting with flavour. My sister ordered the black rice porridge cooked with coconut milk topped with banana and mango (comes with extra coconut milk for added richness and palm sugar for sweetness), which was good too, but in my mind the extra coconut milk will need to be used to do it proper justice. I have a bit of a sweet tooth too, so some of that palm sugar won't hurt either. A little bit of extra fruit might have enhanced the taste of this fibrous porridge. My favourite, which is what I ordered, was the mushroom on sourdough, iced with a dollop of poached egg. The place looks of course, like an archetypal Ottolenghi establishment, bathed in white hue descended on the even whiter marble floors. I didn't feel the gold enough though (come on Yotam, give me some more of that aurous glitter!). The bathroom tiles bring out the white even more, and if it not were for the slight dullness outside, I would have had a little bit of a headache at the end of it all. I suppose that synthetically created solar emotion in a restaurant is not so bad for us, Vit D starved Britons.The bill, \u00a350 for 3, sounded about right. I'll be back for dinner!",

My favorite at NOPI is their breakfast. I never went wrong with any dish, all different eggs were tasteful, and the French Toast as well.Book in advance since they will always try to seat you at \"NOPI Downstairs\" although it is not bad, but personally I prefer eating upstairs. Downstairs is a long table with a long bench that you will be sharing with everyone else setting next to each other facing the main kitchen. You could try it once! Overall, it has been always an enjoyable experience. Cheers",
