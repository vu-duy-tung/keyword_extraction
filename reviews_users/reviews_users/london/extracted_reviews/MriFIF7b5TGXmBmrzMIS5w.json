Standouts for me were: the broth that the cockles came in was delicious; the sardines were perfectly balanced with the citrus (grapefruit and orange slices); the Middlewhite had so much flavour; the mackerel was cooked to perfection; and the pistachio brittle was amazing. Service was a bit spotty but still attentive and I love the ambiance. As my coworker said after our meal, I was \"blissed out on good food\". I honestly will be talking about this meal at least for months and can't wait to return when I'm back in town next time.",

    "text": "After walking around for the London Open House event, I settled in for a late lunch at the place that just won British Restaurant of the Year in the London Restaurant Awards. It's been on my list for a while, and because they typically take bookings, and I know that its sister gastropub, the Anchor and Hope is hopelessly busy I was fortunate it was fairly quiet for that time of day. From the outside, it looks like an ordinary restaurant or pub, with only a picture of a crown amidst a dinner setting instead of name distinguishing it from its neighbours. Dozens of tables inside huddle near the front of the restaurant, with only three or four alfresco tables outside. Even though they had plenty of tables to choose from, I decided to sit at the bar, if anything, just to get a better perspective of the entire place, and for an easy sideways glance into the kitchen, full of flames and a relentless stream of orders in and out. Service wise, this place impressed me because not only was it fast, efficient but it was also friendly. Whilst perusing the interesting, apparently ever changing menu, they immediately placed a board topped with hearty bread chunks, butter, salt and coarse pepper, in front of me as well as a jug of chilled tap water and a small glass. I love this about places where you don't even have to ask for it. Despite the great service, what really matters to me is the quality of the food and I cannot express how delicious my meal ended up. With lots of tempting daily specials and many dishes resembling those you'd see at St Johns, I eventually settled for the seven hour lamb shoulder, and based on a recommendation, a side of green to go with it. At the same time, as I contemplated a red wine to go with, the bartender graciously offered me a sampling of their wines including their Beaujolais wine, a lighter red wine whose full flavour peaks when it's chilled. Although I settled for something different, I thought it very nice of them to offer. Being a seven hour lamb shoulder, it unsurprisingly came out quickly since it didn't really need any other cooking. Even at \u00a313, I thought the entire bowl was going to defeat my normally fearsome appetite, only to be satiated by the soft, melt in your mouth flesh accompanied by sweet carrots, and other vegetables in the dark gravy. The bright green cabbage brought a sharp and fresh contrast to the almost overpoweringly rich flavours of the lamb, and let's just say I walked out of there a very content person. Great for groups, couples and individuals, Great Queen Street offers something for everyone. If only I had room for dessert, I'm sure it would have been just as amazing as the main dish.",

For started we were placed by the window with a perfect people watching position and secondly I later found out that this is the sister venue to The Hope and Anchor - the amazing pub that dazzled me with fish dishes that I have still yet to eat in! The menu here though is impressive, all of it seasonal and created daily. You are welcomed by positively the most intelligent servers I have ever met in London. They really know the food can explain everything on the menu and relish in that slightly without arrogance. Also with some freshly baked sour dough bread and butter...mmmm....butter!The food itself is wonderfully British and if you don't like traditional food, featuring a lot of meat then this place is not for you.

Not for the vegetarians or for those who are somewhat wary to try game or traditional cuts of meats, but a must for those who want hearty fare - especially on a cold December evening!Went with OH and a couple of friends on their recommendation and it didn't disappoint. We started with a round of oysters - delish! I then had partridge - never had it before and it was lush (thought it might have been a little gamier though but will remember that for future reference) OH had ox casserole (not oxtail - just ox) one friend had belly pork, and the other decided upon smoked haddock. We ordered a couple of sides of potatoes and some greens. Was definitely worth ordering more potatoes - they were also very yummy!We were all pretty stuffed after the meal and so we savoured the remainder of our (very affordable and tasty) wine with a couple of cheese platters - thoroughly reccommend, truly scrumptious!One other nice touch about the menu was that several dishes were to share between 2 - in particular the sole and the pheasant pie (which i want to try next time if we are in season).Can't remember exactly \u00a0how much the bill came to - think it was around \u00a3130 or so, but that did include the wine which was probably around \u00a330.Have since recommended it to loads of people and am looking forward to a return visit",

The younger and more easily to get to sister of Southwark's Anchor & Hope, Great Queen Street serves quite tasty traditional pub food that is more posh and innovative than your average g-pub in town. The meats and particular cuts used here can be a bit wild (their game dishes are superb, however). The menu changes daily and is very seasonal so you know you're getting the best of British produce. My favorite dish I've had is the Arbroath Smokie (a delicate white fish they serve filleted open in a delicious cream sauce). The staff is very helpful with any questions you may have on some of the less common menu items or any of their wines, but trust their opinions!

Thats NOT good, but plenty of tap water on offer by the staff.The bill just came with 12.5% service included which I asked to be removed. Less than 2 minutes later before I was able to pull out some coins and put my card away, the (?) manager approached and asked if the service was OK because I didn't pay it... Well I find that damn cheeky... Poor tourists who dont notice that added and dont know its optional by law! I have now down graded to 3 Stars because of this issue and the ordasity of being approached. \u00a0Again I tell you why I have been negative so you can draw your own opinion. \u00a0I WONT however be returning here...

It is a bit loud in there though because it's so small, and I would also recommend a reservation. But over all, wonderful and different food at a reasonable price with great service.

A nice, crumbly tart.Others at the table had a foie gras terrine, the saddle of rabbit shared plate, grilled lamb hearts, and the whole plaice. \u00a0All looked quite good. \u00a0The other desserts that people had were okay--nothing stellar. \u00a0It's not the most inventive but everything seems to be executed with a high degree of precision.",

We weren't that hungry so we ordered the pork and duck terrine, small meat and cheese plate with quince paste, and the braised beef, ceps, oregano and polenta for entree. The pork and duck terrine was pretty good, but wasn't the best terrine we've had. The braised beef and the polenta was probably the best thing we ordered. It was tasty and well done. Service was good and our waitress answered any questions we had, but they weren't as attentive as I thought they would be.

They were happy to move tables around to accommodate. \u00a0Looking at the menu on a Saturday night I saw the lamb shoulder, ooooh who's gonna get in on this feast tonight? We made a group decision to order a main each and share the lamb. WOW between the group we barely finished all of the lamb because there was so much of it. It was delicious and very moorish especially with the dauphinoise potatoes as a side.I had the onglet steak. It was cooked rare and well cooked. Only downside was that they cut it up for me. I am not a huge fan of that because I like to cut my own meat. Otherwise a flawless meal with great service.There is a cool cocktail bar downstairs too but didn't have a chance to check it out",

    "text": "Back to the beginning of November 2015 when I was looking for restaurants to go to for our trip to London, I found this place and figured \"why not\". The reviews are very good and there's quite a lot of them too so I shouldn't be badly surprised when actually going there.In the end, I have to say that personnally, I really enjoyed the place. The food was good, the waiters were friendly (though the one we had seemed a bit stressed somehow, even though there was basically almost nobody left to wait on) and I also liked how the place looked. Also, I have to say that I loved the food. Apart from the dessert which was some regular ice cream that I had chosen and that was all in all just ice cream, I found the other dishes I had to taste quite good and to also look fairly nice too, which is always a nice touch.Now, everything about our visit there didn't make me so happy. I was honestly a bit surprised with the way they presented their menu, on a single sheet of paper with basically no structure at all and just text. That wasn't really something that reassured me. Something else I found odd - but I have to guess it depends on the person and their taste - was how they used those little glasses for every single drink. Be it water or alcohol, the same kind of glass was used. That's not something negative, by all means, but I did find it odd.And finally, more than anything else, I was surprised by the price we paid for two. Keep in mind that we both had an alcoholic drink, a starter, a main dish and a dessert. All in all, we had to pay \u00a397 with the service included. Honestly, I found that to be very expensive. Maybe that's normal by London's standards with restaurants, but considering it was my first time there, I had some trouble swallowing the pill, even though I had swallowed the food itself without any problems a few minutes earlier.",

Waters were brought and shortly after our buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad and calf liver plates. My husband had the beer on tap which was described as slightly warm flat and bitter which we found hilarious but were offered a taste. He found it to be none of those things and enjoyed a full pint. My salad was a modest portion but done v well - the mozz was sprinkled in a crunchy topping and added some textural interest to the creaminess. His calf liver was truly unctuous and well sauced. We topped off w the chocolate fritters which we noticed many other tables enjoying. My husband actually closed his eyes while biting in as the first one released the heat of the freshly made treat. It was akin to a souffl\u00e9 in that way and we were so happy there were two so we didn't have to share! Pricing is decent and the overall ambiance is happy and satisfied.

I love doing this as I get to sample more of a restaurant's food :)I was initially a bit concerned as the two-person tables are a bit crammed in and placed in rows - the waiters have to regularly \u00a0squeeze past you. As well as this, the restaurant doesn't play any music upstairs and so there is quite a din when this place gets busy. However, these two things do make the restaurant a bit more cosy and intimate!Staff are really knowledgeable and friendly, and were happy for us to take our time to decide. My boyfriend had a Freedom beer (he testifies this was really nice) and \u00a0I had a carafe of white wine which they then serve in teeny tiny glasses. I can't decide if his made me drink faster or slower!The food was too quality and I will definitely return; even though it's pricier than a lot of nearby restaurants, it's worth it.Afterwards, we went downstairs to their cellar bar which had really bright lighting and so wasn't as atmospheric as it could have been. I had a Moscow mule which was lovely, but my bf's silver bullet was hard to finish... A tad too strong! I'd avoid it if you don't want to get hammered :)",

The service was excellent from making the reservations to food service to completing the bill - all excellent. The food was outstanding. Lots of delicious options with outstanding flavors and textures. The wine that was paired with the meal was excellent as well.The crowning moment was the satisfaction from all my guests. It was a business dinner at a restaurant I had never been to, so I was nervous, but everyone was so happy in the end. I really look forward to returning to Great Queen Street.",

It was still really packed however we were lucky enough to get the last table in the back. I ordered the chickpea dish, which had chickpeas, mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. It was very flavorful and very filling (I could only finish half of it). The mushroom plate was heavier, with fried mushroom/cheese/breadcumb rolls and courgette. We loved the crusty whole wheat sourdough bread that came out before the meal as well!The reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars is primarily because of the service. Service was really slow, and it took forever to get our dishes and then finally get the check. Our server was nice, however nothing out of the ordinary. It was also really hot in the restaurant, but probably because of how many people were in there. Prices are slightly higher than our normal meals, but still reasonable.I would try it if I was in the area!",

We ordered their steamed whole fish, steaks, bottles of red wine, artichoke and desserts; the fish was amazingly fresh and tasty, we were impressed that they even serve whole fish (with the head); steaks were also perfectly cooked and melt in our mouth. The wine the server recommend was quite nice, smooth and goes so well with their steaks.Service was alright, perhpas they were quite busy so they were not too attentive. Overall, a very nice experience at this restaurant and I do recommend here for other people who visit this area.",

So willingly I let her drag me to whatever place she thought would be fabulous. Great Queen Street it was. The well hidden cellar bar is supposedly really crowded normally, but the rare appearance of the sun meant that nobody obviously wished to stay under the ground. We asked if we could have a drink outside instead and a friendly waitress guided us to a table. It's a treat as such to sit outdoors in London. I kinda wish there were more terraces for days like these. Sitting in the evening sun I ordered a glass of wine, while my friend opted for a glass of sherry.What I loved, other than the really friendly and patient waitress and the nice sunny terrace, is the fact that the restaurant has multiple really affordable wines on offer that can be ordered by the glass. To find an affordable drink in central London is a gift in itself, but to have the option to choose between multiple red wines that are all priced less than a fiver is unique. Other alcoholic beverages, including my friends sherry and a whole range of cocktails, are equally well-priced, so I will definitely return when I have the chance.",

Definitely a place you should make reservations for (I had no idea as it was my first time there). Cocktails here are great.

When we walked in the place wasn't full but we were told all the tables were booked (always a good sign) but they were happy to seat us at the bar which actually wasn't overrun with drinkers. The menu was pretty phenomenal with a lot of things US eaters might consider \"game\" meats like ox, rabbit, partridge and mutton--but I feel like they were all pretty accessible for someone wanting to try something out of the ordinary but still slightly familiar and not too far out of your comfort zone. I had the partridge with cannelloni beans and it was pretty darn spectacular. The broth/stock it was served with was great and flavorful. My girlfriend had a leek, pumpkin and goat cheese concoction that was equally good--so good well probably spend the weekend trying to replicate it. Luckily, partridges are pretty small so there was room for dessert. We had a fig and raspberry tart that may have been the best thing we ate of our whole vacation (and we had just come from Paris). Well likely try and recreate this as well!The service was great, friendly and well informed about the menu and ready to explain, the atmosphere was perfect, and the craft beer selection was great--it's nice to not have the corona/heinekin/budweiser safety net when overseas. And the price for all that (including a few pints) was just under \u00a340. If I'm ever back in London, it's the first dinner I'm having. And maybe the second.",

The premise is real English food - not the fish and chips rot you normally get, but more traditional fare. The restaurant was full (good sign on a Thursday night), but I was able to sit at one of the three tables outside. The menu changes daily based on what ingredients are available. I chose a venison with barley dish that was slow cooked to perfection. The service was a bit irregular, but not bad for the UK and the owner/manager? was very enthusiastic and helpful. When i talked to the business they didn't know they were on Yelp or what Yelp was!All in all, a good choice instead of the usual curry houses or other imported cuisines. P.S.

    "text": "So, I did have a great time here, and I did love the food. \u00a0I think on any normal day, I would have loved to give this restaurant five stars. \u00a0The reason I'm taking two stars off is because I really really had my heart set on the rabbit or the lamb, but I couldn't get either. \u00a0The day I came in, the restaurant had served the last rack of lamb, so I tried to settle for the rabbit. \u00a0My second problem? \u00a0When the waitress asked if it was okay to bring the rabbit out rare, I asked if it could be prepared med rare. \u00a0She told me she had asked for a previous customer and the chef would not cook rabbit past rare. \u00a0Disappointed, I settled for my third choice, fish. \u00a0The fish was extremely juicy, tender and had a delicious citrusy flavor. I've heard a lot of rumors about how flavorless British food can be, but boy does thus this Chef knock down every stereotype. \u00a0The fish was impeccable - beautifully seasoned, perfectly cooked, and just exploded with flavor. For dessert we had a chocolate cake dish with pomegranate. I think this is my new favorite combination. Definitely beats chocolate and strawberry or chocolate wi raspberry any day of the week! I would love to come back and try some of the other dishes on another trip to London some day. \u00a0Although this time, I really hope I can get my first choice dish.",

Having moved jobs and with fewer excuses to visit it I revisited it today for a Sunday set lunch and will re binge in the near future. \u00a0If you want hearty gastro Anglicised food come here. If you want a pie, or a chunk of leg of some non descript animal stewed for 7 hours or a earthy terrine or some other solid food (almost an English version of Lyonnaise cuisine) this is the place to go. \u00a0The food is a bit less fussy than its sister restaurant in Waterloo, but it is smack bang in the centre of town, has awesome excited (in the food) staff, good wines and enjoyable house wines and along with the fact that you can get reservations here, it makes it just about perfect.",

The menu is british which means lots of gamey birds, venison, pies, rillets, fries, cheese, etc. I had the rabbit rillet as a starter which was a bit dry and flavourless. However, I might be a bit biased since the week before i had the MOST amazing duck rillet that can not be compared to anything!|As my main, i had some a whole bird (forgot what type -either quail or partridge) which w as a bit difficult to eat since my knife/fork skills are HORRIBLE! I ended up just picking it up with my hands and gnawing away on the bones; while a waitress politely placed a bowl of water to rinse the grease off my face. Anyways, this place also has a good selection of wines to go along with the meal which can be quite a rarity at mid priced restaurants. Tip for readers: Make sure to call ahead and make reservations!",

Came here in March with some friends for lunch and have been meaning to write a review for ages!A step above your classic pub fare and truly delicious for it. We shared the chicken liver pate and rillettes to start with - the pate disappeared sharpish, the rillettes were less popular. I followed this by a bean and vegetable soup, my friends had a rabbit salad and confit de canard if I recall - everyone raved about their food.Dessert was a divine pistachio cake, or which I could have eaten three slices...Really loved the laid back atmosphere of this place, that still serves good beer but let's the food shine through.I hope Great Queen Street gets the recognition it deserves, although once it is awarded it's first star it will be even harder to get a table!",

You can wait for that in the downstairs, rather basic, cocktail bar. So off we went. We got two seats at the bar in 10 minutes.I actually preferred eating at the bar. Also gives you a good view of the semi open kitchen. Always a good sign. Another good sign is when a restaurant has daily specials. We had what they call a 'Crab Custard', which was a Crab mousse, as an appetizer from the specials. Very nice. We also ordered some cold haring. Very refreshing. We shared the appetizers, so that made for a good combination.We took one of the specials as main course. A classic I haven't seen on a menu for ages and which I remember eating in my childhood, growing up on the french border, from a french canned brand: Cassoulet. The very friendly waiter warned us that it was quite a heavy dish and had to be ordered for two. Sharing is caring. It was a good choice: the duck was excellent and they added some blood sausage to give it a British twist. Maybe one negative was that there weren't enough beans and sauce. But I might be wrong, I only have a canned history with Cassoulet.We finished sharing some very sweet apple pie with clotted cream. The bill was reasonable and we were full and happy.",

    "text": "A warming hearty meal in a warming hearty place. I caught up with a good friend here for dinner; she'd been before but it's somewhere I've often walked past and noticed it looking busy. Last Friday eve was the perfect opportunity for me to try it out.The interior is warm and welcoming with high end restaurant touches merged into a more informal gastropub setting. My ex-housemate shares a common characteristic with me in being ten minutes late for most things, so we arrived about the same time to be seated at a candlelit wooden table for two near the bar counter.The wine menu has a good spread of price points though doesn't tell you the grape variety for many of the bottles, so unless you're very up to speed on the names of the individual producers in each region you're somewhat flying blind. We asked our friendly waitress about some of the reds or what she'd recommend with lamb, and though I'm sure she must've been tempted to blag it, credit to her that she admitted she wasn't sure and she'd ask her more oenophilic manager. She reported back with some useful info and we were able to pick a full-bodied one that we both loved. Always good to ask on these things - life's too short to drink bad wine, right?The food menu changes daily with plenty of roasted meats and comforting sounding options. We both picked the lamb which nicely cancelled out any food envy - though that struck later when we saw a huge steak and ale pie arriving for two at the table next to us which looked great fun to dig into. The lamb was an excellent choice though - the meat nicely tender and pink, cooked with peppers, aubergines and anchovy. I wasn't sure about the anchovy part but you couldn't taste it in isolation, and altogether it was a decent-sized hearty dish that went well with new potatoes to share. The pleasingly sharp knife to get stuck in was also a welcome touch.The setting was so lovely we happily whiled away a good few hours chatting and enjoying our choice of wine. They did occasionally have a few people standing at the bar counter - and thus right next to our table - waiting to be seated, and one of them managed to drop a glass which smashed quite close to our feet. Just as we'd shot them an unimpressed look of course I managed to knock our little pepper pot off the other side of the table too. It cracked into 3 pieces which we propped back together against our empty wine bottle before leaving (childish I know but it seemed like a fun little jigsaw at the time) so err apologies to the restaurant when they found it!We went for the three-types-of-cheese plate for dessert which was the perfect way to end on a high, though far too much cheese for the two of us to finish. We gave it our best effort though - it was a good complement of a soft goats cheese, a blue and a hard all served with tasty oatcakes. It's not an everyday type of place and the bill came to \u00a340 a head for a main, dessert and wine which felt about right for this place. There's a lot of competition around this level but I'll be adding it to the date night shortlist. Best suited for a special cosy dinner I think - they can accommodate groups but most of the tables are for two.",

The best dish was probably the smoked eel salad, which contained plenty of eel. The potted shrimp, on the other hand, was a cold, nutmeg-shrimp flavored spread and a piece of toast. Odd, and not in a good way. On to mains: the partridge was overcooked, and tasted like very dry chicken. The grouse, meanwhile, was the most bizarre dish of the night. It was cooked correctly, and had a nice gamey flavor profile on its own, so really no more dressing was needed. However, it also contained the following:-A side dish of gravy, to be poured on top (flavor profile #2)-A side dish of cheesy, pasty stuff, which you were then supposed to dip the meat in (flavor profile #3)-A couple of spoonfuls of cranberry sauce under the bird (flavor profile #4)-A spread of pate on toast coating the bottom of the dish on a piece of toast (flavor profile #5)To quote Annie Hall - \"what, no pineapple?\". This dish was far too messy to be enjoyable in any way. \u00a0Also, note that GQS is punishingly loud. I could hear individual conversations from four or five other tables, and this was on a Monday night. That plus the bad food made us want to get out of there as soon as possible and forget the whole thing. No beers on tap save for one watery cask ale (not deducting points for this, just FYI). Service was fine, if you could hear it above the din.",

I will absolutely be returning next time I'm in London.",

I'd be interested to try their sunday roast one of these weekends. \u00a0Great queen street - you definitely represent gastro pub at its best.",

Their wine list really stands out with thoughtful selections, including an orange wine section and a \"pudding wines\" section (for dessert wines). And the service was friendly, knowledgeable, and hip. Standouts on menu: ham hock and rabbit terrine with leeks in mustard vinaigrette, ceps and Parmesan polenta cake, as well as merengue and raspberry custard for two. I did not have anything I did not like, actually, it's just that those items were extra delicious. Would definitely go back if I lived in London. :(",

    "text": "Summary-- The best food we had in our 5 days in London. My husband and I went to Nopi and Dishoom the first few days, came to Greet Queens Street on the 4th day, love it so much we made another reservation for the 5th day! We totally ordered 6 different dishes and every one of it surprised us! The waiter and waitress were all very very friendly, cheerful, and accommodating. I told the waiter that it's the best meal I had in London, and I really mean it! Love the food and service both! My husband also loves how the menu is always changing, it means the chef really cares about the food they offer! Highly, highly recommend it! And we will definitely go there again the next time we are in London! \u00a0Detail-- This restaurant is indeed full of surprises! We went there for dinner and love it so much that we made another lunch reservation for the same week. \u00a0At dinner, we had the lamb shoulder \u00a0for main dish to share and the potato dish (I forgot the name), pig cheek for starter. The cream with the potato was so good, we (two ppl) finished the whole thing. I'm not good with words so I can only tell you the lamb shoulder was very tender and juicy, the carrots with it was very sweet. We love every single dish we ordered! \u00a0For lunch, we had the beef and ale pie. It wasn't usually offered at lunch, but at the previous dinner, the waitress was so nice to help us \"pre-order\" it so the chef can prepare it just for us! \u00a0I'm usually not a fan for pie crust, but I love this one!! The starters- Smoked eel salad and the fried octopus (?) was also delicious!",

The crust is the superstar here. The suet was like a perfectly crunchy top layer and where the crust meets the chicken creates almost a dumpling like belly. Also, I was impressed with how tender the chicken was and had an amazing seasoning I could quite identify. The terrine was also tasty. Nothing really stood out other than the fact that went perfectly with the stewed plumsMan do I wish we would have had room for the quince tart tartine.

I wasn't sure if having such an important event at a never-tried place, but she positively promised me it was worth it. She raced about the pies, as this is one of the few remaining places that does suet crust, and said we could not be disappointed.The 4 of us thought the menu looked fantastic and decided to go for the 6-hr slow cooked lamb shoulder, which serves 3. Of course, I had to get the steak and ale pie, which serves 2, so we had 5 mains to share! So naturally we added chips and gratin dauphinois to our order as well. The smell from the lamb was almost more impressive than the flavour... ok not really as it was to die for, but you know what I mean. The pie was being scrumptious and I owe my friend a giant high-5. We tipped the night with 2 puddings to share, and the super fab staff even gave our engaged couple a glass of champers each. Love love love this place!!",

I cannot recommend that you go else where strongly enough.My wife I were very hopeful after looking at the menu onine. The appitizer was so forgettable, that I can only remember that it was slow and mediocre. I ordered the steak. It turned out to be so tough and stringy that I could not chew it. My wife's fish stew was equally disappointing.As bad as the food was, the service was worse. The manager for some reason was refusing to seat couples at open 2 person tables. The place is small. There were 3 perfectly good tables open. He \"created\" a new table six inches from the end of the bar, then proceed to congregate six inches away from it with the other staff. He continues this trend, seating couples at the \u00a0bar as they arrived. By the end if our meal there were 5 \u00a0two person \u00a0tables open, and maybe 3 additinal \u00a0couples eating at the bar. My point, don't eat here unless you love a horrible seat.Our waitress was in explicably absent. There were only maybe 6 to 10 table and 4 or 5 saff. However, they were slow , not helpful, and had a general attitude that they were completely unconcerned with providing a good dining experience.I suggest that you go \u00a0else where.",

    "text": "The best thing about this restaurant is that the menu is always changing. You will never eat the same thing twice here as they adapt what they have to the best of what is available. I frequent this place regularly and I can honestly say I have never had a bad dish.Traditional British prepared game is probably what I'd say they do best here. The service is top notch, although depending on how busy it is, it can be quite slow. It can also be quite loud in this establishment and the tables are close together so you can easily hear other peoples conversations. They do have tables in the alcoves of the windows at the front, which if you are lucky enough to grab those, could be quite romantic. But the deeper you get towards the back, the louder, and hotter it becomes.They also have a spectacular drinks selection, with a lot of home made spirits and cordials. Their homemade ginger mixer is great. Perfect for a mule or dark and stormy. They also have a bar downstairs which is never as busy as I think it should be as it is pretty awesome.Overall - this place is top notch and I love it. It can be VERY busy, so a reservation would be best, or if you can go at an off-peak time.",

He has now been quoted on more than one occasion as saying \"This is exactly the kind of restaurant that I would like to run if I ever ran a restaurant!\" - To say we love this place would be an understatement! It has become easily our favorite place in London because it is fantastic, wholesome, generously portioned food that changes with the seasons and yet delivers consistently elevated flavors every time. The ambience is casual or even intentionally rustic with beautifully worn exposed wooden tables that allow the focus to be on the food and the company instead of feigned refineries. Though they take reservations, we've never had trouble getting one on short notice. The staff is wonderfully well versed in the menu and make recommendations readily. They are attentive and friendly and serve everything with the same care that you imagine they would in their own homes. On one occasion we ordered far too much food (as they have many Main options that are portioned for 2 or 3 people and in our efforts to try everything on the menu, we have issues with moderation) and three waiters worked quickly to pack up an embarrassing amount of food for us to take home. We ate like kings for a week!",

The bartender was kind enough to greet us and let us know that our table was available already and seated us. After about 15 minutes of sitting, she came back and apologized, brought menus, bread for the table and a carafe of water. She didn't ask a about drink orders and I figured she'd be back soon. 20 additional minutes later, a waiter who had been taking care of nearby tables approached and quickly asked what we wanted. No greeting, no apologies, just quickly tell me what you want. We ordered drinks and all of our entrees at that time. The drinks arrived quickly and the food soon followed - they were all brought by runners(not our waiter -Sebastian) Excellent rabbit, wonderful blood sausage. But- we never saw our waiter again until he showed up at 9 and asked if we were done. We had all been planning on a few additional cocktails and beer, but by then, our drinks had been empty for 20 minutes and we just wanted to leave. He quickly brought \u00a0the bill, ran it through the card machine and tore off my copy without a word. No smile, no thanks for coming, nothing. We just spent the last week in Paris where we were treated very well by the servers- I expected London to be superior, but just found this to be the least welcoming server I've ever had. Go for the excellent food , but not if you expect to be treated well.",

Cold peas straight out of a very chilly fridge, some were really not that fresh, cold soup. Mains were good but portions I found a bit meagre. Had to order new potatoes and greens (just cabbage) separately, small portions again. It was very good food, I had the duck with fennel, carrots and bacon. Honestly, I think I have had better, more flavoursome meals for the same price. This dish definitely needed something. Something to go with it, some sweet potato, carrot and swede mash, some real bulk. It was beautifully cooked, and tasty, but just atop a small bed of vegetables.I found the young waitress just a bit rude and a touch patronising, I am sorry to say. I was with a bunch who are a bit old and past it, and they are hard of hearing and a bit fussy, I found her not all that patient. So sorry to be writing this review after reading so many others.

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full article, see: wp.me/pwXBH-uP  Long Live the Queen I had been looking forward to meeting fellow food blogger Craig Linton (twitter: @craigdlinton) for a few weeks after I invited him to meet up for lunch a while back. Luckily, I wasn't too nervous as I had already met another food blogger a few months back for lunch (see a post about that meal here). Although it is always a bit disconcerting meeting someone you've emailed and tweeted with but never met in the flesh, I had the sneaking suspicion that we were going to get on, given our seemingly similar attitudes towards restaurants and food, which are of course the two most important things in the world (Mrs. LF is going to kill me if she reads this). So, in the middle of our two places of work, Great Queen Street (GQS) awaited. The little sister of some British gourmets' favourite (and I cringe as I write the word) 'gastropub', GQS has no real name, no website, and no gimmicks. It is all simple wood and dim lighting inside, with informal but fairly knowledgeable staff. Like so many London restaurants today (St John and Bocca di Lupo spring to mind), the daily menu is presented on a loose sheet of paper, inferring that the menu changes daily and is probably more or less seasonal. And GQS checked all those boxes. The menu was quite traditionally British, and the simple, hearty fare sounded good to me as it had been a rather long and cold walk to get there. Unsurprisingly, I arrived on time, and was shown to a little square table for two, where my blind, male food blogger date was to join me. It was all a bit weird, but luckily I had seen a photo of him online so more or less knew what to look for. A bit over-anxious, I waved haphazardly to the next dude through the door based on just the faint outline of his face, who luckily happened to be the man himself. Phew. After a long and enjoyable getting-to-know-you chat, we were scouring the menus like to men on a mission, trying to make wise selections in the presence of the seasoned foodie across the table. Decisions made, we continued with a very engaging and pleasant discussion, until the thing that united us finally arrived. Grub time. Getting Down to Bi'ness Some brown bread and butter had arrived, so we both had a small piece of it. It was pretty average and there's nothing much more to say about it. I now eagerly awaited my main. 5/10. I had heard a lot about Old Spot pork but had never knowingly tried it, so despite some reservations about a room temperature dish (that's how they serve it) on a cold November day, I went for it. Luckily, I was not disappointed. It was a very simple dish with three main components. The pork was sliced to a medium thickness and the circles of fat were left in tack around the rim. It definitely had a unique full, round, mouth filling flavor that I hadn't experienced before. It was surprisingly interesting and had me going back for more, especially when combined with the tangy yet slightly sweet and in-season crab-apple jelly. Because the side of greens we ordered was so delicious with its naughty, slightly creamy mustard sauce, which had a nice streak of acidity, I sort of ignored the little salad that came on my plate. This was a shame, because when I tasted it as an afterthought, I found it was actually quite good and it would have been a nice little accompaniment to the meat and jelly. Overall, then, a simple and accomplished dish. 8/10. I had ordered a glass of Beaujolais to go with my pork, thinking a soft, easy-drinking fruity wine would marry well with the flavors. It was brought out in a little ridged tumbler (like a small water glass you get in a bistro), as was Craig's Portuguese red, which I thought was taking the minimalism a tad too far. It's okay to serve wine on tap into a glass like that (like a place I went to in Venice once called Da Marisa), and Beaujolais after all is a very casual wine drunk with simple food in France, but I like my wine to breathe a bit and think a normal little wine glass would have been better. Rants aside, the wine did what I hoped it would and was a nice sipping partner for my late Old Spotted friend. It's worth noting that before tasting my own dish, I was quite jealous of Craig's main course just on the looks. It reminded me of the hearty beef stroganoff my mom used to make us when I was a teenager. Luckily, he didn't think I was a complete freak when I asked if he wanted to taste some of my dish, and even offered up a bit of his beef. The meat itself was very soft and tender, having been stewed for a long time, and the sauce it was bathing in was not bad at all. If I had to label it, I'd say it was sort of a European beef curry sauce, with its richness being supported and enhanced by a nice underlying spice (the 'devil' bit, I supposed) that ruminated and lingered in the mouth for a good while. I didn't taste the rice or the egg, but the bit of meat and sauce I",

We also had the plaice and the lamb neck. instead of the kale we ended up with brussel tops and some roasted potatoes. I didn't mind since I've never had brussel tops before and they ended up being pretty damn good. My favorite was the lambs neck. The meat was tender and juicy and I had to steal bits when my wife wasn't looking. I had the plaice and it was the best fish I've had in the UK so far.

It was just cozy and sweet and the tables were far enough apart where you didn't feel like people were too close but the tables were also small enough so you could hold your partners hand and the lights were pretty dim and the place was pretty small so it felt intimate but again not to squished. I was a huge fan of the menu because it had a lot of options (especially for us fellow pescatarians... yeah, I'm pescatarian at the moment ;) ). The star of the entire meal was the entree- sole with leeks and potato. We shared it and the portion was massive and so delicious. Really, that fish was mighty tasty and the sauce and seasoning complimented it so well and the addition of the potato and leeks was important to counter balance all the saltaaayyy. The other dishes were also delicious. Trout with pickled cucumber, salted anchovy salad and burrata with asparagus. All in all it was just a fantastic meal with great ambiance.

    "text": "Hands down the best dining experience I had in a week of eating out in London. This place was spectacular. We were very lucky to get in without a reservation, as we came right at opening time for an early dinner. What made this meal special was that even the small touches were so well executed.The menu is daily, changing depending on what ingredients are at hand, which is always exciting. That sort of rustic, farm-to-table mentality is seen throughout out the menu. We started with the warm eel and sausage salad. While this may sound strange, it was fantastic. The eel was perfectly smoked, and the sausage was very flavorful. It all came together beautifully with a tangy vinaigrette.For mains, we had the duck with lentils and seafood stew. The duck was simply to die for, perfectly medium rare with crispy skin, on a bed of lentils with a very tasty herb sauce to spice them up. I would highly recommend whatever the duck main on the menu is, as they really nail cooking this protein. The seafood stew was decent, but nothing too special.For dessert, we split the giant apple tartine with Calvados ice cream. Mmmmmh! Definitely worth the ~15 minute wait as it takes to a ooey, gooey perfection. It was beautiful to look at, and even better to eat. The Calvados ice cream was excellent on top too, and was strong enough that the whole tarte was flavored with spirit. A beautiful combination.They also have an ever changing house beer/ale, which was a nice touch. There's a varied alcohol selection, for whatever budget, including plenty of \u00a3100+ bottles.If you're in central London, head to the Great Queen. Or better yet, get a reservation in advance. You won't be disappointed.",

I found it to be a tad salty, but that came from the combination with chorizo. The veal special was tenderly cooked to perfection. The meat was easy to cut and had the right flavor. The German pasta was lightly fried and very doughy. The beignets came out piping hot, were coated with sugar and came with raspberry jam and cream. I can see how this is be a crowd favorite!Overall a solid place to stop by. There's a cellar bar tucked away downstairs, which looked like the perfect place for date night.",

After receiving such high reviews I was immediately deflated with my pick when My husband and I sat down to the menu. There were very few items on it that I saw Yelplisted, I'm sure they change it up frequently, but it was still a shocking selection. My husband and I had the house red wine (good but sweet) and a Manhattan (too much vermouth). We were struggled to find something we'd enjoy on the menu but settled with ham and cheese croquettes which were good, and for our entree we went with one of the shared dishes (we saw it go by and it looked beautiful!)- roasted oxtail with risotto. The ox was subpar, the inside pieces were moist and delicious. The outside bits were quite overcooked and dry. I will say with whatever chutney they had on top and the risotto, every bite could be delicious, but on its own, the ox didn't stand up. The service was odd - it didn't seem like we had a dedicated server and even though everyone seemed to be serving us, we felt neglected. We sat with empty glasses for quite a while when we first arrived and then again between rounds... including water.One of our servers saw us struggling with the menu and made no attempt to offer selections.I made a reservation as suggested but the place had plenty of seating - it was a week night though. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",

Definitely needs to be shared between 2 people but it tasted like a delicious slow cooked beef stew cooked inside the perfect homemade biscuit crust.

The ambiance was great, cool laid back and packed! We ate at the bar. We were shocked that not one person was on their phone while they dined/conversed. So refreshing! Dessert was amazing, even though we were full we ate the entire slice of strawberry tart. Moist soft buttery crust with sweet slightly tart (in a good way) strawberry filling in the center.

I had been here about 10 years ago with the man who is my husband now.Great Queen Street was a quite upmarket pub then, and we shared a rather good chateaubriand. Sadly this is now a less than average 'gastropub' serving a variety of mediocre offerings. I had the potted shrimp to start, which was ok, albeit a large portion. The other half had the mozzarella which again, was huge, and he said was drowned in mint.Next I has wanted the chicken pie, but that was only for two people, so in the end we both had the pork Milanese. It came with picked red cabbage and pea pur\u00e9e. The cabbage was sickly sweet and was choked with cinnamon, and the pea pur\u00e9e overwhelmed everything. We ordered a side of chips which were dry and tasteless. I asked for a glass of prosecco on arrival, which I had to send back because it was horribly sweet. They didn't have any other variety and wouldn't sell champagne by the glass. We shared a bottle of ribeiro de duero for \u00a336 which was fine.Service was good and prompt. The place filled up quickly as the evening progressed and the atmosphere was good, although they did place all the diners together in the centre of the room. The tables are a bit too close; the back of my chair was touching the back of the next person. Disappointing. I won't return.",

Although it was one of my favorite restaurants in London, I'll never go back due to the arrogant and unaccommodating service I received on March 8, \u00a02018. I will try to make this short.I live in New a York City but I am in London often. On that evening, we were a party of five with 7:15 reservations. I ordered a bottle of wine which, when it came, was sour. I asked the waiter (who was lovely throughout) to please replace it since it was sour. He came back and said he could not. I asked to speak to the manager. Someone who said he was a \"manager\", and who would not give me his name, came and said that the wine was not corked. I told him I knew the wine was not corked; I had said it was sour, not corked. \u00a0He told me that it was an organic wine and that that's the way it tasted. I explained that I knew wine and that the wine was not supposed to taste that way. He said it was, and that I was wrong. I ordered different wine which was fine and the evening proceeded nicely. When we received the bill, we were charged for the first sour bottle of wine, along with the additional bottles we ordered, plus a service fee. I went to the \"manager\" and said that I would pay for either the sour wine, or the service fee, but not both. I also said that since he was so unaccommodating, if I had to pay for the wine, I would never return to the restaurant. I explained that I am a qualified sommelier (absolutely the truth). He nastily responded, \"Good luck with that.\" \u00a0He further said that he would prefer if I didn't pay the service fee and never returned. He would not take the sour wine off the bill. I was not offensive, confrontational or abusive. But he was. Awful treatment, awful customer service, awful way to run a business!!!",

It's on a street full of tourist type restaurants and I must have walked past it many times as it looks so unassuming. Once inside there's a lovely casual vibe and despite it being a busy Friday night we weren't rushed along at all. The staff were polite and friendly and it just had a really great, people out with their friends having a nice dinner kind of vibe. We tried the beef for two which was fine, but I think I need to remember beef != steak as it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The menu was full of gorgeous sounding stuff that I can't wait to try though. I'd recommend the roast veal as a starter. Will definitely return.",

Great for relaxed Sunday lunches or chilled out dinners with friends \u00a0superb British cooking with pates, soups and terrines to start, and fresh fish or meat as a main. At the Anchor & Hope version we shared pheasant and rabbit; at 32 Great Queen Street I had tasty pig's cheeks and El G had lamb's neck which looked like it had been guillotined off there and then. Some of our friends ordered the beef rib between six and got half a cow on a plate, cooked to perfection, a slab of rare beef with blood swimming round it. The boys were drooling a la Homer Simpson and someone mentioned the meat sweats \u00a0the sort of food I'd imagine served in a country mansion after a hunt years ago. Something your dad or boyfriend would love, and they were super nice to my veggie friend too.",

We had some good beers and he made several recommendations, checked on the specials for us, and explained every item on the menu. By 9pm a lot of the food choices were gone so I would suggest making a reservation and arriving at an earlier time. Do not think that because you are at a nice place they are not going to feed you well! Abandon all ideas of little plates and be prepared to eat hearty heavy food- rabbit pie, pig's cheek, chicken pot pie, potato soup, lamb shoulder.We had the lamb for two. This neck flank could have fed three easily. It was so tender and juicy. I am a big fan of lamb and this was incredibly tender, fall off the bone, melt in your mouth heaven. Only one can imagine what the 7 hour lamb shoulder tastes like.It is loud, fun,crowded, friendly, dark, young, hip. Not too expensive. Wait staff amazing.",

The third star I am giving it is benefit-of-the-doubt-ish as to my personal tastes. Skip the snails (though the bits of black pudding were good, proving I don't hate all culinary things British) and the pig and pigeon terrine. The gnocchi were interesting, but I didn't like the underlying peas. The mackerel special was okay but full of bones, as is apparently customary with most fish dishes here.

So it's really all about me. For those of you who've always room for dessert, here's a tip. If you're eating anywhere else locally, come here for it - you can eat at the bar. The creme caramel (made with marsala) is absolutely the best dessert I have ever tasted; certainly in this town. Service is great (if you're nice to them, they're very nice to you), and you'll almost certainly want to go back asap, as I do. Update 15.1.10 Be careful when ordering the Mallard, currently on their menu - unless your January diet's still in force - it's legless and less substantial than you might think, although accompanied by roasted chestnuts and sprouts, all suffused with the scent of wood smoke. A carafe of Douro sufficed, a glass of beaujolais each to accompany a shared anchovy salad, the perennially delicious marsala cr\u00e8me caramel and buttermilk pudding for my friend, our two-and-a-half course meal came in at \u00a368 inc service.

If I lived nearby, perhaps in a pod located deep within the bowels of the aforementioned masonic lodge, I could see myself visiting once every week or two. The term \"full mouth orgasm\" was used.Crowd was eclectic, bordering on the bizarre. A Twin Peaks style collection of hipsters, blue haired theater goers, some post-hip young adults and a few shady Mason types. Decor is nothing to write home about, but it does make for a cozy shack in which to gorge oneself on all the delicious. The food was a full step above your average gastropub fare. -A simple preparation of fresh cockles, sweet and small, bathing in a broth of onion, butter, and an alcoholic beverage I couldn't quite place (almost tasted like madeira, but it definitely wasn't). -Fresh Maldon oysters. Honestly, the liquer was a bit on the muddy side...not really Great Queen's Street fault. I'm just more used to pacific oysters which pander a bit more to my tastes. -The smoked haddock gratin (can't remember their terminology) was a monument to excess, a mound of smoky, creamy savory goodness. - A masterful mushroom ragu over something described as \"gnocchi\" but what came out appearing as a giant polenta cake. No complaints. This was the best dish of the night. If you've ever heard a chef talk about \"building flavors\", you'll know what I mean when I say that the sauce was impeccably constructed. It hit every level on the spectrum you would want out of this kind of sauce. Musty, rich, and full. -Scottish Onglet with what appeared to be fresh creamed horseradish, served admirably rare. -For dessert, make sure to get the muscat creme caramel. Sure, it's basically a flan. If flan had a sexier, more delicious cousin. Trust me. Get the damn muscat creme caramel.",

They're interested in the food, the wine, that you're happy with your choice. They want you to enjoy it. This attitude isn't easy to find in London and it really stands out.The menu is an interesting mix of (dreadful word) rustic offerings made with high quality ingredients.

Beauty and simplicity all rolled into one.Oh, did I mention that it's pub-casual? Yeah, no white table cloths or cloth napkins.

And it scored.I like the fact that even though it didn't have availability for Saturday night, the place accommodated us at a bar - and I love bar seating. Honestly I think there should be more restaurants with bar tables only in London.I ordered pork and clams - and I'm not a fan of salt so someone who's keen on that - might not enjoy it, but I liked it - it was warm and hearty - for the cold winds outside.My friend went for the Onglet, and even though it's apparatenly a diaphragm - it tasted like prime fillet steak. But better. I would certainly go back just to have a whole plate of it to myself.There are not 'stir-fry', 'curries' - the menu was British - at least as I can imagine British cuisine like to be when there were no KFC and McDonalds.It's a bit shabby - I didn't like the table arrangements and the lighting - well it's just a dark place, I think with some refurbushiment they could easily score a 5.I would certainly try the smoked roe and some of their desserts next time I'm there!",

    "text": "Hmmmm....a little underwhelmed with my meal but enjoyed the direction and feel of the food.Started with the smoked roe, cucumber, radish, and baby gem lettuce salad. This dish was quite tasty, but I had a minor gripe; the smoked roe stuck together so you would have large bitter bites of roe in and out of your dish. Near the end this sort of killed me palate. Overall quite nice though...Next, I had one of the daily specials..a whole artichoke. This was a huge let down. I could tell that the quality of the artichoke was high, but it was so bland to the point of dismissing the dish entirely. Furthermore, it was served with a mustardy sauce that was way too bitter and not savory at all. The mixture of bland and overpowering was a major let down.Finally, I had another special: fried rabbit shoulder and celeraic remoulade. Quite hit or miss as well. I feel that although the quality of the rabbit was exceptional, the fried aspect of it overloaded the taste. The rabbit was already gamy and a bit fatty...frying the cut was a bit too much. That being said, the taste was nice and reminded me of Southern chicken. The celeraic remoulade made me sad face as well. It was a tad bit too bitter and empty as far as ingredients go. I wish it went somewhere.I'd give this place 3.5 stars if possible due to the quality of the ingredients and interesting combinations, but I don't think the execution is on the same level as it would appear when reading the menu.",

It wasn't because I was being indecisive, it was because, apart from the potato soup that was delicious and the shrimp, I had no taste experience of anything else on the list. Great Queen Street serves impressive British cuisine with offerings such as pigeon, sole and other non typical delights. Your usual eating habits may have to take a detour, as there wasn't a burger or a plate of chips in sight.All the dishes brought to the table looked excellent. My pigeon looked like a little chicken, but once you cut into it, the flesh looks and tastes like beef. Yet it went exceptionally well with the fois gras and lentils. I had to order potatoes as a side dish. They were good to. All in all, Great Queen Street is a pretty expensive casual British restaurant, serving from a high end menu that smacks of the upper class. I was there for lunch and had a good experience, but wish I got to try one of the lovely sounding desserts. The starters and mains although very good, aren't quite my style. One needs quite a refined palate to fully appreciate this place to its fullest.",

Luscious and satisfying, I couldn't imagine a better appetizer.After hearing the description of the rabbit pie on special I knew I had to have it. Thankfully, my dining companions were up for taking it on together.Great Queen Street gave me a distinct appreciation for suet crust pastry. Before eating their incredible rabbit pie, I didn't have a clue about suet or the magical deliciousness it can impart. Additionally, I was completely ignorant to the fact that rabbit, when slow cooked, ends up tasting a lot like chicken without a hint of gaminess. Great Queen Street provided me with a level of satiation that's been tough to find elsewhere in London; I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",

I took a friend from out of town here during the winter and we had a really delicious, relaxed meal at the bar with some strong drinks that were surprisingly reasonably-priced, for the location. Food was well-made and portions were deceptively large! Seems like they rotate the menu regularly as well to use in-season ingredients. I had a salad with rabbit and bacon and some other things in it a while back, and it was literally the best salad I've ever eaten, and I'm sad that I haven't seen it again on the menu since. GREAT QUEEN STREET IF YOU'RE READING THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!It's not the cheapest place, but for the quality and creativity of the dishes prepared here, it's well worth the price! For anything else within a stone's throw of the British Museum, GQS is hard to beat.They take group bookings and it's really nice that they don't force your whole group to order off a prix fixe menu the way that it seems lots of gastropubs these days do.",

If you do the math, that's over 15 places already - and still nothing that I really enjoyed.Until now.Not only did the waitress know the menu fully in-and-out, she was able to describe why she liked a particular dish - how long each dish had been in rotation, and what the chef was trying to accomplish with the ingredients. I am not sure how she manages to remember this for a rotating menu, but I decided to go for the newest item - the grouse pasta.The grouse was slow cooked and pulled apart, very tender and juicy without losing its gaminess. The vegetables that accompanied the grouse in a sort of stew-like fashion paired perfectly. The pasta was ziti and soaked up the stew very well. Overall a great meal, and one that's going to have me returning for quite a while.",

Wait staff was amazing, as was the owner/manager.",

Even though the restaurant was packed, the food and service was excellent and absolutely delicious; which is probably why they were so busy. As far as price, this place was on point. When I got the ticket, I was surprised by how much the ticket was. However so, remember that the service charge isn't included, so it wouldn't hurt to leave a little extra! Especially due to the seriously outstanding service you may receive here.",

I have an English friend who now lives abroad, and she always mentions this place when we're in central London and looking for a place to eat. Now we bring our other friends here when they come to visit.During my second visit, I've enjoyed a whole fish for two, covered in vegetables and delicious sauce. On the most recent visit, I saw duck on the menu and couldn't say no. They paired it will an onion chutney and parsnips. Every duck loves a sweet accompaniment. Gluten-free notes: Most dishes here are naturally gluten free, and they were happy to advise about what was OK and what wasn't.",

    "text": "While in London, I was in the search for tasty, affordable, and authentic British cuisine. I've heard my fair shares of how \"British food is horrible!\" and \"You're going to lose so much weight when you come back from the UK because you won't eat anything\" yadda yadda - Not so, my friends. Not only is Great Queen Street restaurant's menu full of game and all your traditional British-y foods, the food was mind you very delicious. Honestly, without a smart phone, I don't know how anyone coming here can order without looking up half the stuff on the menu. Because it has been more than a few weeks since I checked in here, I can't recite the names of the dishes off my head but they were very complicated and you'll find yourself asking the staff what exactly you are reading and is the menu still in English. Luckily, the waitress was super helpful and knowledgeable and was able to tell me exactly what was what. I played it safe anyways and got something I could pronounce - the partridge. It was my first time having partridge so I can't compare but it was pretty tasty if not plain messy. Don't think you're going to get through this entire bird without using your hands. I was hoping no one would see what a noob I was at eating whole gamey birds, but boy I was glad my waitress was attentive enough to see me struggle cause she brought over a dish of water so I could dig in and get real dirty eating. On a lunch day, I think you could score a seat without reservations but I can see how this big restaurant can easily fill up with people at night. It's good for both groups and small parties because they have the space and the table sizes of all kind. To sum it up, have your smartphone with you to look up food on the menu, attentive staff, prepared to get hands dirty if you order partridge.",

Make sure you ask the staff for recommendations - they helped me pick the food (I had slow cooked pork) and guest ale (excellent one from Hampshire) and even advised me not to order sides dishes, as they would be unnecessary unless I was starving. Even recommended other (competing) pubs. Great, lively pub/ restaurant atmosphere and food, with genuinely helpful staff. I'll be back",

    "text": "We are foodies! We asked the Concierge for a non tourist restaurant (as we always do when traveling). He suggested Anchor & Hope. The restaurant magnanimouslyaccepted our last minute reservation under the condition that we be OUT in one hour. That was fine with us. We jumped in a cab & arrived 25 minuted early. The restaurant was mostly empty. We reminded the MA\u00ceTRE D'/waiter that our reservation was not for another 25 minutes, but we were early and wanted to respect their request to be OUT within one hour. Our arrival time gave us an extra 1/2 cushion.One would think that they would promptly serve us. NO. It took almost 20 minutes for them to ASK what we wanted to drink. 10 minutes to take our food order at which time THEY realized the time and were now rushing US. \u00a0We ordered lamb (wanting to eat one of their specialties.) They said that all the food is made to order and that the Chef ONLY cooks HIS way, and that we could not have it medium rare. OK fine. CAN YOU SAY RUBBER/GRIZZLE? We cut away so much that was inedible, all that was left were mouse scraps. The waiter also pushed a side salad (and I use the term loosely). It was an over filled, under sized bowl of straight \"out of the bag\" spring greens. We didn't even bother eating it. We left HUNGRY! We had better food anywhere else in London. All they accomplished was to perpetuate England's OLD reputation of having terrible food!I asked about the Free Mason Lodge across the street, (seeing men in black coming out with the same square briefcases). It was one of the few times the waiter actually smiled, he said \"They don't come here anymore because they don't like the way we treat them\"!You're not alone boys!There was NOTHING redeeming about this restaurant. Let's assume that they thought we would not be repeat customers and gave us pathetic food. Wake up Anchor & Hope! It's a small world out there and the internet is VERY BIG! People, don't waste your time. We would have been better off in a fast food joint!",

The menu has something for everyone but emphasizes hearty dishes - game, meat pies, etc. \u00a0They won't like me saying this, but the \"seven hour lamb for three\" (braised lamb shoulder with root veg and very rich pommes dauphinois) will feed four people easily. They are into bold flavors here, letting the food speak for itself amid a relaxed vibe and simple surroundings that recall a country pub with a serious cook rather than a Central London bistro . \u00a0Thoughtful and varying selection of wines and beers. \u00a0Prices quite reasonable considering the location and the quality on the plate. \u00a0It's a standby for me whenever I'm in London.",
