We had booked ahead the night before hand and even the incredibly freezing and icy conditions didnt put us off venturing out of our way to visit this supposed gem. We arrived - mentioned we had booked a table. The waitress looked a little confused, looked around the full restaurant and then said 'oh yes your table must be downstairs' a little odd we thought but followed her out of the warm, romantically lit, buzzy main room down into a cold basement room with flourescent strip lighting and pointed to a table for 20 and told us we could sit there. There were 2 of us! They obviously had no idea about our booking and for some reason I just didnt fancy sitting somewhere where they hadnt even bothered to honour our reservation. We left, annoyed, and wondering why on earth do restaurants around this area of south london consistently get it so wrong?",

My prawn pho was hot, spicy and mollifying but lacked a depth of flavour to suitably knock my socks off.The service was sufficiently brusque, the kind of service you'd expect at a low-key BYO establishment.Two starters, two drinks and two mains came to \u00a328.

It was packed when we were there on a Monday night--though we didn't have to wait for a table, I wouldn't be surprised if the staff is simply used to having to shuffle folks out the door as quickly as possible most of the week.I had a delicious sea bream with mango in a light and sweet dressing--half of which I ended up having to forfeit to my partner who \"doesn't like fish\", so they're doing something very right. For my sacrifice I was allowed half of his goat with galangal--the sauce was rich and complex, but the goat was a bit on the chewy side. We may have silly expectations for goat, though, having been introduced to it in the mountains of Crete.Nice wine list with detailed descriptions of everything and recommendations for particular dishes on the menu. Everything our neighbours had was beautifully plated and smelled amazing, too, so we'll probably be back soon!",

Food is fairly straightforward, and, as other reviewers have alluded to, free from the cloying and noxiously unnatural sauces you might find in the cheaper sort of Chinese. Service is somewhat random \u00a0I've waited the thick end of an hour for a takeaway \u00a0but well intentioned and friendly. This place fills up fairly quickly at the busier times of the week, which is pretty much any time it's open ( popular with many locals, and AA Gill rather liked it), so you may want to book.

    "text": "We have eaten once previously in Mien Tay, and found the food to be fine but not amazing. However, this review relates to two recent aborted attempts to visit the restaurant. On both occasions we experienced the same problem. On calling to reserve a table, we were taken through the whole booking procedure (when would you like to book, how many people, what time etc.) to be told that there were no tables available. The suggestion was then made that we 'come down to the restaurant as something might become available'. On the first occasion we didn't bother, but last night we did. On arrival at 7pm, we were told that there was nothing available until 9:30pm. This raises two questions: firstly, how can the restaurant suggest that 'something might come up' when they are so solidly booked until late that night? And secondly, if they know they have availability at 9:30pm, why not just take a reservation for that time over the phone? To make it worse, the staff were rude and unconcerned when delivering this message. It seems to me that perhaps Mien Tay is becoming a victim of its own success - and they will quickly find that if they keep up this poor attitude and inflexible booking process they might not be quite so busy all the time.",

    "text": "I was alerted to the existence of the new Battersea Mien Tay almost from the moment it opened by South London food bloggers and tweeters @chrispople (cheesenbiscuits.blogspot\u2026 ) and @hollowlegs (lizzieeatslondon.blogspo\u2026) , and other equally fanatical foodies. It's practically unforgiveable that I hadn't tried it until today, given that I live literally two minutes away. I had relatively low expectations, having judged the place - rather like the proverbial book cover - by its external, na\u00efvely kitsch appearance. I have embarrassingly not been to Vietnam (to be rectified in 2010?) but I have variously had Vietnamese in New York, Sydney, in Hong Kong, elsewhere in London, and possibly somewhere else, and NONE, not one, matches the sheer, ludicrous, surreal brilliance of Mien Tay, Lavender Hill. Communication started badly - the English of the staff is worse than poor. Add to that the fact that I didn't want to even attempt to make considered choices from the 202-item menu, but rather have suggestions made for me, and I couldn't make them understand that I didn't care or know what I wanted, I just wanted them to feed me according to their whim. Having more or less made ourselves understood, because my dining companion's patience far surpasses mine, we were treated to a hypnotic array of flavours and sensations that must be the most perplexing and delightful within a radius of two miles, until you hit Chez Bruce on Wandsworth Common, Trinity in Clapham, or Cambio de Tercio in Chelsea. With a big difference: this costs next to nothing. There isn't a dish over six quid. Two people can stuff their faces for under \u00a330, or eat a huge bowl of pho for a tenner between them. Stand out dishes: Chim c\u00fac (Chargrilled Quail with Honey, Garlic & Spices) Pho t\u00e1i vi\u00ean (Rice Noodle Soup with Sliced Beef & Beef Ball) B\u00f2 lua hong (Sliced Beef in Coconut Juice & Wine Vinegar, served in a Clay Pot) For this last one, you cooked it yourself at the table, on a small gas cooker! We finished off this remarkable feast with something scarily called Ch\u00e8 ba m\u00e0u - Gelatinous Seaweed Rainbow Drink with Mung Beans. We will be returning, again and again.

The fact that they attend to your needs AND bring delicious, light, bright Vietnamese food to you is like a bonus, and one that only gets better when you get the bill. They're very efficient so they will have charged you for everything you've eaten. The prices are so ridiculously good value, however, that you'll assume they haven't. Stand outs for me included the beef rice paper rolls, honeyed chicken and a lovely, vibrant papaya salad. The chilli oil - dried shrimp is, apparently, the key - is also the best balance of heat and flavour in a condiment that I've had from North London to the wilds of Battersea. Perfect for groups, fun for couples, great for anyone grabbing a quick solo snack, this is definitely going in the address book. Mien Tay is EXACTLY the sort of little restaurant that makes me proud to be a Londoner.",

    "text": "Here's a quick write-up on a great lunch deal. Mien Tay is a Vietnamese restaurant with two branches, the original in Shoreditch and a newly opened one in Battersea. Living south of the river, I went to the latter following positive reviews by other bloggers. Their set lunch menu consists of a range of one-dish rice or noodle based meals. None cost more than \u00a35 with free extras of prawn crackers, a bowl of egg & vegetable soup and half an orange. I went for the rice vermicelli with spring roll & chargrilled pork (bun cha gio & thit nuong). This dish is very simple with bun or rice vermicelli served at room temperature topped with spring rolls, chargrilled pork, salad and herbs accompanied with nuoc cham - a sauce consisting mainly of fish sauce and lime juice. You simply add the sauce into the bun and stir. Mien Tay's version was pretty spot on. The salad and herbs were fresh, the spring rolls weren't too oily and the pork was very flavoursome. It's not quite as good as Song Que's version as the chargrilled pork isn't quite as juicy but I'm nitpicking. The lunch deal is amazing value and I was surprised that there were only 3 people eating here on Saturday lunchtime. I'll be sure to return to Mien Tay with friends for a proper meal in the near future.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  I hardly ever get over to Battersea. The only reason for me to venture out into this tube-less part of town is the Battersea Arts Centre \u00a0an utterly great and creative theatre well worth the journey. If you have the chance to see 'The Children and Animals took to the Streets' by 1927, do it! This was one of the best and most entertaining shows I have seen in the past year. Additionally, I really like the bar at the BAC, I just wish it was closer to where I live, I would hang out there every day Anyway, one of my excursions to the other side of London made me try Mien Tay which is conveniently located just a couple of blocks away from the BAC. I went to the Mien Tay in Kingsland Road once and I found it terribly bland. I liked the Battersea branch better, but also this one, despite serving very decent quality Vietnamese, did not blow me away tastewise. The Fresh Green Papaya Salad with Prawns (5.50) was certainly enjoyable. There was nothing wrong with the green, freshly grated papaya with exotic herbs and prawns immersed in nuoc mam, but nevertheless I did not experience the flavour explosion that similar dishes at for example Song Que provoked. The same applied also to the Chicken Pho (5.50). When it's cold outside and I am anywhere close to a Vietnamese restaurant I have to have pho. There is nothing as comforting and warming as this delicious chicken soup with loads of Vietnamese herbs, some chili to clear your respiratory system and vitamins from the fresh bean sprouts. The pho at Mien Tay was solid and nice enough and I wouldn't mind eating it again, I would however not go out of my way to feed my addiction with this particular variant. Having said all this, Mien Tay is really cheap. You can get out of there for 10 pound/per person without slumming it. And that's actually worth a honorary mentioning.",

You wouldn't expect it from all the positive magazine reviews they've plastered on the outside of the restaurant window, but yeah, it sucks. I think I'm qualified to give this place an honest rating cos my mate's family runs a Vietnamese joint and I used to go to the Eden Centre on a regular basis which is pretty much Little Saigon. My biggest beef is that they brought out dishes as they were ready so you had to sit around until everyone finally got theirs. They also kept forgetting the accompaniments, no pancakes with the duck, no rice with the curry. I had the misfortune of ordering the \"aromatic duck\". There was nothing aromatic at all about it. It was nothing more than a boring plate of duck scraps, which was dry, flavourless and \u00a0not even a hint of the 5 spices you usually smell. My wife had the chicken curry and it was pretty decent. Nothing special about it, but hard to mess that up though. My overall impression of what I had, and looking around is that you could fumble about in your own kitchen and come up with better Vietnamese food than here.",

However, the pho is pretty good - one of the best I've had in London and I've had a few - with generous portions of beef and noodles, for only \u00a37. Win in my book.Prawn summer rolls were ok, which was a disappointment. The mekong catfish we tried was tasty, but the sauce was a bit too salty. My benchmark for Vietnamese catfish is the one from Cay Tre - this is definitely not as good.Overall, I'm going to be coming back, but for one thing only - the pho. But it is worth coming for if you're local in the area. Note - this place is cash only as well. But there is no service charge!",

Don't be surprised if you find yourself seated in very close proximity to other customers- the tables are very close together. I ordered the fresh prawn paper rolls and some beef pho, although my friend has the crispy vermicelli spring rolls and I couldn't help but pinch a couple...they were amazing! \u00a0Pho tasted delicious and reminded me of being back in Vietnam- great way to warm up on a cold winter's day in London. All the food was very fresh and fragrant. Alcohol-wise they have beer and wine, and they also have Vietnamese coffee on the menu. My only gripe is they don't take cards- it's cash only. Thankfully there's an ATM about 40 metres away.",

The tables are really cute, they have a 3D scene of a traditional Vietnamese house (i'm guessing...). We started with the spring rolls which were nice and crunchy on the outside and full of veg on the inside. I opted for the lemongrass and chilli chicken which was really tasty. My friend had the chicken curry which was super delish It tasted like a spicy yellow Thai curry. We both got sides of rice, but we only needed one as it a huge side. I was a bit off put when we walked in that the guy who took us to our seat was coughing quite a lot. However, they servers were nice and were quick to come over once you get their attention. The price was amazing for the food we had. I even have some leftover for lunch today... yum!",

If you aren't opposed to quail, try the barbequed quail - succulent and flavoursome. Yum!The venue is small and it's a bit packed, but I guess that keeps the atmosphere cosy and the cost down. You feel a bit rushed when you eat there because they want to turn over as many tables as possible, so it's not somewhere for a a first date (unless you're in a hurry to depart or get to the bar). At the end of the meal, they give you complimentary dessert by way of fresh, sweet orange slices. Great way to end the meal.",

We had previously ordered take-away from there with some friends as they knew it and essentially introduced us to it.The decor is not great (though the wooden houses under the glass at the tables is kind of cool) and the 3 star hygiene rating kind of put me off but since we'd eaten their take-away before, we knew the food was great.We ordered sparkling water and green tea. The menu says 500ml for the water but it's actually 330ml. Not a bit deal but really should be changed as that's a bit of a difference. The green tea was excellent, a giant pot of it that seemed never ending and had a great flavor. We ordered the beef pho as an appetizer because we were really hungry and it came pretty quickly. It was very tasty except I suspect it did have a bit of MSG as near the end, when it was just the broth, it started to have a kind of weird flavor. They brought our mains, Chicken with Cashew Nuts and Scallops with Ginger and Spring Onion very soon after the pho so the table was quite crowded. We also ordered some steamed rice as we had forgotten before. The rice was very sticky but surprisingly good and went well with the dishes. We thought both dishes were tasty though my partner said you could definitely taste sauce more than scallops in his dish (I didn't try it). The service was good, when we needed something (rice, fork, extra glass) they brought it right away.I think we would definitely go again and can recommend it to anyone looking for some well-priced and tasty Vietnamese!Be advised, it's cash only!",
