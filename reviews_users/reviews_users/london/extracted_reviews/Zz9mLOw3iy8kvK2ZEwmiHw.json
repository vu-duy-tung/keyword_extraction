    "text": "By the same designers of Hakkasan, Mint Leaf is a great option to pre- and post-theatre dining with a Londo flamboyance, and without the harrods-bag-carrying tourists. \u00a0I went there after seeing 39 Steps just down the Haymarket so we had a 10:30 reservation, which was needed as they were completely full on the Thursday night. \u00a0The kitchen closes at 10:45, so be sure to get your orders in fast, which isn't too hard as the menu is quite small, especially for an Indian restaurant.The fod was quite surprisingly simple, yet very good. \u00a0I tried the Salmon tikka with yogurt sauce and the chicken tikka with mint dressing as starters, and the paneer and peas curry. \u00a0The starters were very light which complemented the heavy creme-based curry. \u00a0I left full but not in the same way as I would at a more traditional Indian restaurant.As for drinks, I had a watermelon and tequila cockatil, but was good, but brown in colour which put me off a bit. \u00a0The cocktail menu is definitely worth checking out.This is a great place if you happen to be in the area for a show, but I would not go out of my way to try it. \u00a0Try it even for one of their cocktails at the bar before a show along with their dangerously yummy wasabi peas.",

There are few restaurants in London I've visited with a bouncer on the door, on a Tuesday night. The inner decor was, to be honest, quite dark and blingy. Management clearly pay little attention to detail: the toilets were filled with cryptic laminated signs on the paper towel dispenser to \"Please use handryer\" (?!), and there was scaffholding clearly visible around the reception desk. The food was really diabolical. I had a disaster of mackerel in a creamy coconut sauce, which is probably the worst meal I've ever had in such a pricey restuarant. The lamb rogan josh was only OK. Service was lovely and non-pretentious, which gives it two stars. But all in all, it's a pretty depressing, overpriced, and blingy Indian there for a tourist crowd.",

I was a touch worried when I entered, as it resembled a restaurant I had hit the night before (Hakkasan), but it truly lived up to the atmosphere. Sure, it was dark and moody but in a great way. Mint Leaf felt more established and classic (as compared to the newbie, Hakkasan). The dark tones actually made me feel quite at home. The food was out of this world - great Indian tailored for all the tastes at the table. Some preferred spicy, others more mild, but the range of dishes chosen (we let the server choose!) really exemplified their range and flavors. The only let down was dessert; it just didn't do it for us. If you go, please do choose the Porn Star martini. It's a mix of papaya, vanilla vodka and champagne. It was so delicious, we must have ordered 10 at the table. On my next trip, I'd like to hit the very cool bar and hang for drinks.",

There is a nice if not high class atmosphere here, with a dance area and mood lighting. There is a great choice of drinks, although they are expensive. We were at a function and we were luck enough to get some cocktails free, if you are buying they are upwards of \u00a39, some as much as \u00a320. Having said that they were really delicious and there were ome house cocktails here you dont get elsewhere.

    "text": "On a suggestion from my little sister's London mate, my wife and I went to Mint Leaf while in town from San Francisco. It's safe to say we had pretty high expectations coming into this place, and I can't say that Mint Leaf really lived up to them. But let's start from the beginning The lounge is cool, and the service was great. We both enjoyed nibbling on the smoked almonds while enjoying our drinks. My wife got a strawberry-martini-type-thing, which she said was, delicious. I started with a mint julep because I was feeling particularly Kentucky Derby-ish. Mint Julep was OK I get the feeling that it isn't ordered all that often, since the bartender himself came over and asked me how it was. I lied and said it was great. I didn't want to hurt the dude's feelings. It was decent, though. Next, my wife got a raspberry cocktail-thingy that she said was, Alright, I don't know. I got the cucumber/wasabi martini that I thought was pretty tasty. If you like cucumber and can handle a little wasabi, I'd recommend this drink. Would have been perfect if garnished with some sashimi. Drinks were good, but pricey. \u00a313=Almost $20, but as we would come to see, London really bends you over if you like to drink (drink well). On to the food. We were really excited to try some good Indian food over here. We ordered the Chicken Tikka, grilled prawns, stuffed bell peppers, rice, naan, some grilled white fish, and a bottle of good Austrian wine. The wine ended up to be better than the food. Mint Leaf takes a sort of California approach to its dishes, taking traditional flavors and sort of giving them a modern update. We could have used a little more traditional flavor. Or any flavor, really. Mint Leaf really needs to spice things up a bit. I don't mean in heat, just pretty much all the way around. Mint Leaf gets 5 stars for atmosphere and decor, 4 stars for wine and cocktails, and 2 for food. I would suggest eating here if you have a friend who likes to spend a lot of money, but doesn't want the band for their buck. Someone who wants decent food, but doesn't want it flavored too much. Said friend will love Mint Leaf. All said and done, we had fun, but paid too much for it. I might go back for a bottle of the Austrian gurvertzaminer (approx. spelling).",

The food is great, and the atmosphere is nice, but it's way overpriced for indian food, so it's hard to justify. Thus another star gets knocked off.

    "text": "Posh part of town, posh-ish restaurant, easy to feel quite good walking through the doors of this establishment with dark walls, dim lighting, low thumping beat of music and discreet service. This is no ordinary curry house, by any measure - the clientele, the ambiance, the menu or the prices. This venue styles itself primarily as a bar which also offers a small selection of gourmet Indian dishes. The seating area is extensive but broken up into more intimate rooms. I perused through their extensive cocktail list, and noted that this venue matched the offerings at the Mint Leaf Lounge near Bank station, but I certainly liked the service at this branch much better.For starters, the three of us (including a Norwegian friend visit from Oslo, he was excited about the Indian fare) ordered Tali Sambukh (Scottish Scallops with Star Anise and Green Peppercorn), Achari Paneer Tikka (Tandoor Grilled Paneer with Pickling Spices) and Haryali Chicken Tikka (Marinated with Ground Mint, Coriander and Kafir Lime Leaf) - each one of these starters was most artfully presented and whetted our appetites in just the right manner, with bursts of flavour but without searing our empty stomachs with excessive spices - thumbs up all around!For mains, we ordered Baingan ka Bharta (Smoked Aubergine Mash with Ginger, Chilli and Cumin), Bhindi Masala (Okra Stir Fried with Tomato, Chilli and Spices) and Kadhai Ghosht (Tender Lamb with Freshly Ground Cumin, Chilli and Coriander) - mind that the portions here are not large and the emphasis is on freshness and flavour so do order accordingly. Each of these dishes was excellent and thankfully not floating in grease (which one would hope for, in such an establishment!) For breads, we had Roast Garlic Kulchas, Spiced potato Kulchas and Peshawari Naan - all of them freshly off the pan, of course.We had started the dinner quite late in the evening on a weeknight - around 9.20pm so we skipped booze and desserts but we were well full at the end of the meal. I was happy with how smoothly my reservations were taken (on their website!) and how we were whisked into our private area. I also enjoyed having a waiter for the table to watch out \u00a0for all our needs even though we were placed in a quiet and somewhat secluded room - all in all, a pleasant experience, I highly recommend for evenings when you feel like an indulgence :)And yet, I do not rate this a 5-star experience because this is an expected premium service at a price, not an unexpected delight.",

For just the food, I'd probably have given four stars. But, it's just too loud for a middle aged old fogey like me. Stereo was blowing the doors off the whole time we were eating. Nearly impossible to have a conversation. Plus, lots of attitude. We liked the waiter we had for half the evening, but a crew of bouncers at the door?",

    "text": "I wish I could give a better review. I had been looking forward to this dinner for a long time. I'm from Denmark and came here for my 40th birthday and had dinner with a friend. We had reservations on a monday evening, after the Phantom of the Opera. The restaurant was almost empty.The food was fine, so the reason for the 2 stars is as following: After we were seated, our waiter gave us 5 different menus: A la carte, theatre menu, coctails, happy hour and winelist. Even though I had looked at the menu online, we needed a little time to decide. None of us are familiar with Indian food and english is not our first language. The waiter gave us 5 min. to look through it all. Then he came back and stayed by our table, till we had decided. He seemed VERY impatient and we felt rushed into ordering food left and right, with no real idea of what we were ordering. Same thing happend with the dessert and cocktails.My friend especially had a hard time ordering her food, because the waiter didn't take the time to listen to her. When ever she opened up her mouth to speak, he cut her off and tried to guess what she was saying. Most of the times he was wrong and if we didn't constantly correct him, he would have gotten our food and drinks all wrong. All because he was in a hurry. We both felt quite uncomfortable with the situation. We almost felt, like us being there was in inconvenience.I'm sorry to say, we should have gone some where else. The good food and nice ambiance dosen't make up for that behaviour.",

    "text": "A sophisticated and intimate Indian place, just off Picadilly and Trafalgar Square. It is based on the lower ground floor, and its small entrance outside does not give away how big it actually is. At the moment there is scaffolding around the entrance as the building where it is located is being repaired, and so the entrance is not obvious. As you go down the stairs, there is the cloakroom on your right. You pass it by and you encounter the bar area, which is quite large and it gets very busy before dinner time. Opposite the bar area, there is the restaurant, divided into different spaces. It has dim lighting, which makes the place feel kind of mysterious and private. The service is friendly and pleasant. I have been here a couple of times and the food has always been good, but the last time I went a couple of weeks ago, I had a tasting menu that was really tasty and different. It consisted of the following plates: - Haryali chicken tikka - grilled chicken with mint, coriander and kafir lime leaves- Malai salmon tikka - tandoor cooked salmon flavoured with pink peppercorns- Sunhari aloo tikki - sesame crusted spiced potato cakes, tamarind chutney- Methi paneer - paneer with onion, tomato and fresh fenugreek leaves- Kadhai jhinga - tiger prawns with crushed coriander, cumin and black pepper- Lamb chettinaad - lamb leg simmered with chettinaad spices- Makkai aur khumb - cup mushroom and sweet corn kernels in onion and tomato- Dal tadka - yellow lentils with tomato and garlic All this accompanied with basmati rice and naan bread :) Finally, the dessert was a coconut parfait with berry compote. I can only say that I will definitely be back ;)",

Please note that the kitchen closes at 11:30pm but the bar stays open until 1am. \u00a0Also, they are off to the side of the building and main road, so can be easily missed.",

Upon sitting down it took more than five minutes to receive water. Then the menu says you must order two items, however that wasn't followed up on clearly. Some people ordered two, others didn't. It was very confusing. When asking for a refill it took a long time for them to come. I didn't even want more drink by the time it came. Then when the food reached the table it was extremely small portions. Also, the place very obviously kept trying to run up the bill. For a place with such an expensive looking decor, there were screaming babies in the next booth that weren't being hushed. Nothing goes with your overpriced, tiny dinner like a side of screaming child. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",

    "text": "TLDR: avoid at all costs if you have theatre tickets. We made a reservation for 3 at 6pm. During the reservation process, we selected the pre-theatre menu so that we could be sure to catch our 7pm show next door. When two of our party arrived at 5:50, the lovely and gracious hostess asked if we'd like to sit at the bar while our table was prepared. Since we were early, we agreed. My friend ordered an iced tea, (which was on the menu), and I ordered a gin and tonic. They brought out a mediocre gin and tonic for me and a sangria iced tea for her. I pointed out that she hadn't ordered that, and the (super good looking) waiter said they didn't serve iced tea. Instead of arguing with him, we asked for water. We asked about our table several times and assured the hostess that we didn't need to wait on our third person. She said \"excellent!\" Because she is adorable. We waited until 6:30 and asked about our table again, this time, to a gentleman that seemed to be in management. We reminded him we didn't need to wait on the rest of our party. He seemed surprised. We were seated at 6:35. A man who came over to explain the gluten free aspects of the menu seemed surprised and annoyed when we asked him to go ahead and take our order. We reminded him about our theatre tickets. Appetizers arrived at 7 and were delicious. At 7:20, I became anxious and asked about our next two courses. I again reminded the wait staff about our theatre tickets. We received our entrees at 7:25. We asked that our third course be packed up. They told us it couldn't be done and seemed annoyed when we asked that the third course be taken off of our checks. Overall, lovely human beings at the front of the house, but slow and disorganized. At the table, the service was nonexistent (glasses were consistently unfilled and requests ignored) or brusque and rude.",

Not something most Indian restaurants give you the vibe of in the states. Walk down stairs to what appears to be an old nightclub/lounge turned Indian restaurant. Very dark, sexy vibes, but again unexpected.Service: 5 stars, we arrived late after viewing a play across the street but were seated quickly with friendly service throughout our dinner. They offered great suggestions and were friendly. No issues there. Food: 4 stars, pretty good authentic Indian food. Overall a good meal of the usuals, chicken tikka masala (nice and creamy white meat chicken), white rice, and naan. Tasty!Pricing is probably why I couldn't give this place 5 stars. I bit steep for what you get. For example the naan bread wasn't cheap and they give you 2 pieces. Normally places give about 4. I think this place is good if your in the area but probably cheaper options if you go a bit further down the block. It was super convenient though because they were open late.",

    "text": "I would like to have given the Mint Leaf a four/five star review, but something happened at the end of our dinner that really bothered me....we'll get to that in a second. \u00a0First the good.We visited the U.K. for the holiday....Sussex for Christmas and London For New Year's Eve. \u00a0We figured The Mint Leaf would be perfect for dinner as we were going to the Hotel Trafalgar for a party. \u00a0They had two set prix fixe menus...one for \u00a330 and one for \u00a350. \u00a0The only difference between the two was an option for lamb on the more expensive menu.I surprised that amount of paperwork we had to fill out in order to reserve a table. \u00a0In addition, I had to fax a copy of both the front AND back side of my credit card which made me incredibly uneasy. \u00a0They were however, very efficient and accommodating and gave us a reservation for four at 7pm for the early/\u00a330 menu.When we arrived, I was reminded of Hakkasan several times, first by the fact that you have to descend into the restaurant from street level and more importantly by the size, decor and dim, sexy lighting of the space. \u00a0There was incense burning in the reception area and several friendly hosts/hostesses there to take our coats. \u00a0The bar was adjacent, so we decided to head over for a drink before taking our table.The pours are generous...and so are the prices. \u00a0I was a bit surprised that my Capparinia had so much ice in it. \u00a0It tasted like one, but looked like a Mojito. \u00a0We were reminded that we had to finish dinner by 9pm, so we decided to move to our table.The host escorted us to a table that was adjacent to the server computer and the door to the bright kitchen which I was facing. \u00a0Call me a pain in the ass American, but I immediately asked to be moved. \u00a0It had to be the worst table in the restaurant. \u00a0Once we moved to a better table, we were all much more pleased with our surroundings.I wish I still had the prix fixe menu we printed out because it was a long night with lots of wine and champagne, but I will do my best...we started with a sampling of samosas which were tasty, which was followed by a tasting plate which included small tastings of what I believe was Matar Paneer, Chicken Tika Masala and a couple of other dishes. \u00a0In my opinion, the portions were WAY too small. \u00a0The final course was the main course. I had a coconut shrimp dish. The sauce was amazing, but the shrimp tasted somewhat metallic. \u00a0The chocolate lava cake dessert was fantastic...somewhat small, but really good.There was also a band playing in the bar that started around 8PM...the guy with the sax roamed around the restaurant playing to the individual tables which was kind of chill.All in all aside from what happened next, I'd say a solid four star experience taking into account the location, ambiance, service and food. \u00a0When the bill arrived, we had been charged for the entire amount of the prix fixe dinner for four. \u00a0Keep in mind I had to pay a deposit of \u00a380. \u00a0Also keep in mind that EVERYONE at dinner that night had to pay a deposit. \u00a0It's not like we were the only ones that paid a deposit and he forgot. \u00a0In fact, the check even had my name imprinted on it by the computer. \u00a0They tried to have me pay the \u00a380 twice in my opinion knowingly. \u00a0If I absolutely knew it, they'd have gotten one star. \u00a0I don't, so I'm just mentioning it so that others who ate there that night might want to check their bills...or those that go next year don't have that \"mistake\" happen to them.",

    "text": "After a little challenge with directions we found mint leaf. \u00a0We had no reservation and got right in. \u00a0It was busy. \u00a0We were craving Indian food but wanted atmosphere and Mint Leaf did not disappoint. \u00a0We had immediate food envy from the table next to us. \u00a0Everything they ordered looked amazing and we would have snuggled up if it wouldn't have been weird. And do we ordered for ourselves. \u00a0We had a decent Bordeaux at 40 pounds. \u00a0Then the calamari and asparagus. \u00a0I thought the calamari was a little reminiscent of rubber bands so I wouldn't \u00a0bother. \u00a0The asparagus was simple and tasty. \u00a0We shared the chicken tikka Marsala lookalike. It's called something else. \u00a0And the paneer and the eggplant And peas. \u00a0All very delicious. \u00a0Service was delightful with Nasir taking care of us. \u00a0Remne was also delightful.",

Of course, they let you in on the bad news after you realize that you're in an embarrassing situation with an awkward elevator ride with your guests back to the street. I caved and paid, but you don't have to.The food tasted okay, but portions were small and they CHARGED FOR RICE!I did get sick that night, so....",

    "text": "On a special night out, my fiance surprised me with a trip to The Mint Leaf, which he'd be dying to take me to for ages. Good things come to those who wait, especially when you arrive hungry at The Mint Leaf.We were promptly seated after handing over our coats at a quiet table. Everyone around us was mostly couples, enjoying a quiet evening. The lighting is dim, the cocktail list (and happy hour specials) is impressive and the atmosphere is chic and inviting. Our server was extremely attentive. From the minute we told her we were off to the theater immediately after our meal, she made sure to rush things along although we had allotted plenty of extra time to enjoy ourselves. We ordered two starters (that were very plentiful in size) including the bhel puri chat (loved the tamarind chutney!), these vegetarian miced pea kebobs (cannot remember the name) and cocktails. For dinner, we ordered the rice, the cucumber onion raita, the tadka dal and a paneer dish. The portions were perfect and everything was so delicious that we basically scraped our plates. We weren't rushed along during our meal, we had plenty of time for conversation and drinks and skipped dessert as we were cutting close to curtain call.I'd really love to come back and know that we will for special evenings out. It's worth the trip as we're quite a hike from the restaurant. It's so nice to eat Indian food in a beautiful atmosphere for once as we're used to eating it in the comfort of our own homes or as as quick takeaway from neighborhood restaurants. Mint Leaf certainly gets it right by putting a twist on classic dishes that even Mom would be proud of.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch. The first thing we noticed was that the decor was nice and trendy. Then, we ordered the lunch sets and extras. Portions were appropriately sized (i find indian food fairly filling anyway). We ordered the seekh kebab, chicken tikka, and meat platter. They were all very flavourful and delicious. Then we ordered the chicken tikka makhani and jalfrezi. The makhani was the usual butter chicken, not as flavourful as other indian curries, but definitely a good representation for butter chicken (had brought people here who never had butter chicken in UK before). The jalfrezi was much nicer just because of its spices (just preferred it in general anyway).The lassi was great, but very filling. I suggest skipping a starter if you don't typically eat a ton of food.All in all, it was a great experience, and the atmosphere and lighting was perfect for a relaxing lunch.",
