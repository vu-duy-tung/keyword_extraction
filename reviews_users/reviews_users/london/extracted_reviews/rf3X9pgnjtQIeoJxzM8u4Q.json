It is situated right on the river in front of the HMS Belfast, a ship I didn't even know about (and I work near here and walk past the buildings that block it from my sight every day). IDIOT!Anyway, a very nice pub, one I hope to stop by more often now that I know about it. I can imagine it getting crowded in the summer since there is quite a nice large outdoor area (but in the snowy wintery cold, it was empty outside). Prices are decent, selections are great, atmosphere is typical for an after-work crowd. Recommended for post-work drinks or if you happen to be in the area, but not for a night out.",

There is a fun, vibrant atmosphere and it is a cosy yet large pub perfectly located next to Hays Gallery.We chose to have lunch here - the menu is pretty good. Quite as you would expect from a pub menu but the healthy side of me was disappointed that everything seemed to come with chips. I went for the vegetable soup (which came with just bread), and it was ok - a bit shop bought tasting but for the cheap price I couldn't complain. My mum and dad had ordered a sandwich each and on arrival of one of them, the waiter informed us that one of orders was not available. Why he couldn't have let us know upon ordering I'm not sure. Still, the portions are huge and the alternative meal came fast and was certainly more than edible.I do think this pub has a lovely charm about it - the setting on the Thames is beautiful and at Christmas time it feels wonderfully festive.",

Take a large public house, in a perfect location - views of the River, HMS Belfast, Tower of London & Bridge, Gherkin, St.Ps, large outside area, right by the station, add a varied menu and some interesting ales and beers. Then do everything you can to ruin this potential. This pub just cannot sink any lower in my estimation. Everything about it is terrible - the beer (not just the ales, even the lagers always taste off. Dirty lines?), the food, the staff, the management (by far the lowest point), the time you have to wait at the bar while gormless drones do F.A. (then sulk when you have the audacity to ask them to serve you drinks in return for ready money. One or the other of us has misunderstood the relationship I thought existed between barman/maid and customer Maybe some one could enlighten me?) I know that may sound harsh but I just could not put up with that place any longer and boycotted it.",

They serve food which makes it a great place for groups or lunch if you don't mind traditional but unexciting grub. Prices are also good.

We were weirded out when we walked in because there was no host or sign telling you about seating. After making a round around the place, we asked the bar tender for info. The way it works is you're supposed to seat yourself, pick your menu choice, & walk back up to the bar and place your order. You must give the number of your table so the staff knows who to bring it out to. Weird. Different...But it worked. I ordered the chicken breast burger, it came out with ground beef patties. By the time they fixed the order & it came out, the rest of my table was almost done eating. Sad face.",

    "text": "So if you've read any of my past reviews, you'll see I'm a bit nutty about London. One of things I LOVE about it is that sunny afternoon where you're just in the mood for a nice relaxing glass of wine with friends by the sparkling river, catching some rays and people-watching (if that was a sport, I would finally be classed as athletic!) Right by London Bridge is one of my new fave spots to do this. So perfectly situated is Horniman at Hays.This particular trip we couldn't find an outside spot (it was just too popular!) so we plumped for a table inside - a good second choice considering how nice the inside is! Filled with tables on different mezzanine levels, it reminded me a little bit of Hogwarts with all the staircases (you know in that hall where they all move?) but this just adds to the charm I think. We decided to accompany our drinks (typical London Bridge price) with some nachos and chicken wings to nibble on - again good price and really nice afternoon snacks. All in all, you can't moan with a life like this!",

    "text": "There are five reasons as to why I am giving Horniman's 5 stars: 1. The name, obviously. Any restaurant that puts horni(y) and man in the same phrase is a winner in my book. Hands down. 2. This is where I had my first Rekorderling Cider. OMG. LOVE! Love I tell you! These ciders are not available in the US, and I may return to Europe for the sole reason of purchasing cases of this cider and having it shipped home. Horny for this cider. For reals. 3. They have the perfect river/sidewalk/view seating. Located right along the river at the end of a shopping area you have the river sights, the Tower Bridge views, the lights (at night) and the people walking. This A+ location is a total turn on. 4. The bar and restaurant has great decor and a really fun vibe. The atmosphere was perfect for after work drinks, a drink with a lover, or kicking off a two week vacation in Europe with three of your best friends. We didn't try the food, but booze always wins me over (and makes me horny if there's enough of it)! 5. The fifth reason, and by far the most important. THEY SERVE SIERRA NEVADA PALE ALE!!! Hollar Chico grads w00t, w00t! Love to see the ye ole college town (and college brew) representing across the seas.Horniman's, I totes dig you.",

It has always struck me as quite oddly placed but I guess there are a lot of workers and few people living in the area. At the back of the Galleria, on the river, is the Horniman pub. It is a good sized pub, and whilst the decor it does look a little like a \u00a0brasserie. The bar is low slung with lots of inside seating. There is also covered seating outside so you can sit out and watch the river. The Horniman is perhaps a little out of the way. However, whilst not particularly exciting it is a nice place and perfectly pleasant for a couple of drinks.",

We were quite hungry and I'm probably being a little bit generous with my review considering my appetite at the time.We both ordered fish and chips. It was served with some sort of Indian Daal in a small bowl. It was a random thing to serve with fish and chips and there was no explanation as to what it was. Mushy peas I get. Daah? No. That's just bizarre. I was a bit peeved that we were charged for tartar sauce with our fish. Is this par for the course in London? I can't imagine it is. Also, we ordered at the bar and it was a bit confusing as to how our food would reach us. They weren't clear.While it was an OK dining experience, I probably wouldn't return when there are so many more amazing places to dine in this city.",

    "text": "#3 on the London Bridge to Tower Bridge DW ale trail is the Horniman (teehe) At Hays. It's tucked within a shopping type centre right along the river Thames. When I was awaiting my mates to join me to kick off our ale trail we couldn't help but be excited about the name. Yes, we may be old enough to drink, but that doesn't me we can't be childish sometimes. I LOVE the inside of this pub. It's is just stunning! During the summer months they have a fabulous outdoor seating area, but I can't wait to brave through the cold to warm myself up in one of the many different seating areas inside. There is a lot of iron cast railings, giving it this feeling of old victoria England. The upstairs dinning room overlooks the river Thames as well as inside of the pub. You walk up what must have been a somewhat grand staircase back in the day. That however is where the good stuff ends with the Horniman. The staff indeed are not very friendly at all, they kind of seem aggravated that you are even there. The menu/drink list is the same as the other Nicholson's, it can either be good or not that great just depends on what you want and how the kitchen staff are feeling that day. There are loads of stairs and no wheelchair access. The restrooms are along a narrow small stairway, sometimes they tend to be busy as the pub is extremely large. Due to the space it's fabulous for groups. It's just a shame that this place has such potential that it's not reaching. I don't recommend it for spending the entire night drinking away your money, but it's definitely worth checking out just because of how you'll feel once you step inside. Whether you're horni or not, everyone can enjoy an hour or two here.",

The drinks are pretty pricey, with bar staff who have to be amongst the slowest in the world. There is nearly always at least a 2 deep queue around the bar, which isn't great for anyone! Fair enough, it is quite an airy place, they do have a lot of tables outside and if you can't find one, you can just hang around without being shouted at (which is rare!). I've also heard that the food is good, but there are too many irritating elements to this pub for me to make an effort to go back to find out.",
