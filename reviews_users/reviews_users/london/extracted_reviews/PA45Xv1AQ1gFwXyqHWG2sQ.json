The ribs and chicken was well cooked but the meat lacked flavour, luckily it came with plenty of BBQ sauce. The prawns where ok but the onion rings where extra salty! :/ That and 1 drink cost around 30 pounds. 12.5% service is added to your bill.This places has a nice atmosphere, it's cosy and very busy, so book in advance. The service was good, and portions are big!",

With its biggest and the best AYCE Americana approach to face stuffing (one of the dessert dishes is a basket of four Krispy Kreme doughnuts with hot chocolate fondue), Big Easy leans heavily on the more is more philosophy when it comes to serving its patrons. There's some decent food on the menu \u00a0I like the voodoo chicken wings and think their daily lobster special (is it still on?) is good value for money. If you like your grub served in a mildly raucous (eg too loud for quality convo) crabshack atmosphere, Big Easy is the place for you. More about that lobster special:londonist.com/2010/05/re\u2026",

Regardless of the route, the destination is the same, this is possibly the worst meal I've eaten at a restaurant. I went to Big Easy with an old friend, who chose the restaurant on the recommendation of her friend. After entering the restaurant, being greeted and seated I noticed that the prices were high. High double digits for what seemed a casual dining restaurant. At this point our helpful waiter suggested the special, lobster and steak for less than 20 sterling. It seemed like a good deal so we took it, and 15 minutes later our fair dining experience was in the toilet. The steak was not horrible, it was like the steaks at Outback Steakhouse, it was important to be hungry. Not bad, but nothing special. The lobster was the true disappointment, it looked horrible and the taste was bleh. I am not a seafood person, so I admit to some bias \u00a0but my friend also quit eating after a few bites and spent the rest of the meal picking at fries. Fries which were grocery store frozen fries, and a bit stale.In short, horrible meal.",

Noted that people arriving to eat without a booking were looking at a two hour wait. Despite the fact that we were surrounded by plates of half eaten ribs (the 6.30pm rib eating competition had just finished) when we arrived and that we had to stand in a fairly cramped area near the bar for our table to be ready, it was definitely worth the wait. Everyone was very happy with the width and breadth of choice on the menu, which included American classic after American classic. It was hard to choose from the plethora of steaks, burgers, ribs, BBQ'd prawns, lobster, crab etc. And even though we didn't end up eating until 9pm, we were kept entertained by the house band and pleasant (if but fairly slow) water/waitress service. After dating an American for 2 years and having eaten food from the US on both sides of the pond I can safely say that the Big Easy is by far the most authentic American dining experience I've come across in London. I can definitely recommend a night out at the Big Easy, if only for the food and entertainment alone. However, don't come here expecting a quick in and out meal. I'd definitely set aside a fair portion of your day and stomach. :)",

The food isn't wonderful but the combination of sports on TV, the lobster vests, live band and checkered table clothes, just cries out 'welcome home' to me. =)It is usually a bit of a wait for a table, but there is a bar area to wait in and the margarita's are pretty good. There is seating upstairs and downstairs. If you want to be able to easily hear your dinner companions it is best to get a table upstairs. Downstairs, when the band is playing, you will have to strain to hear, or yell. During the summer there are a few tables outside which are great. Although, I love any sort of outdoor seating in London!",

On a Friday night when there are drinks, food and a live band (that only came on as we were leaving...) why did they expect us to rush in and out? Who knows... I ordered a lighter option- the BBQ chicken salad, but it was tasty. The ribs that my husband ordered were good and had just the right amount of sauce.",

This cannot be said for most places in Chelsea.I had the catch of the day: a 2lb. Nova Scotia lobster and the fiance had a surf and turf selection of a small steak and 1/2 a smaller lobster. We both enjoyed them. Having never had a whole lobster before, I expressed my concerns to my waiter who assured me I'd be fine. The lobster arrived cleaved down the center, which was great for a first-time lobster conquerer. While my fiance's half lobster was fine, mine did seem like it could have used a touch longer in the pot as the tomalley was a bit gooey (not that I was going anywhere near it, but I do know it should be firm). Still fine, though. Drawn butter was extra, but only 50p. Fair enough. The wait on a busy Sunday night (without a reservation) was about 20-25 minutes, which was quite reasonable considering it's not a big place. There was live music being played downstairs and piped through the whole place. A fun atmosphere. A bit loud, but nothing terrible. Definitely a place to return to!",

Always friendly, willing to banter with you and not intimidating but professional.This is one of few restaurants I've been to more than once and the service/ food has been impeccable every time. It doesn't matter if you go in a big group or a small group the staff take care of you. Never get orders wrong and even put up with jovial behaviour the group I was with displayed after a few drinks.They almost always have singers performing and the music is decent, it adds to the atmosphere. You can eat for less but I doubt very much you get this quality cheaper, not to mention the portions are big. My favourite's are the lobster, the steak and the ribs. There isn't much space because this restaurant has been busy every night I've been there. It doesn't seem to matter whether it's a Thursday Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, it's constantly busy. You will have to wait to be seated and the food will take some time to get to your table but when you're in a group and the conversation is flowing you might not be so bothered.I've booked a table in advance and turned up without booking so for me this place is worth the wait, but I would not recommend going without booking a table in advance if you want to make sure you can eat there. This is arguably one of my favourite restaurants in London, you will not be disappointed with the food or atmosphere you be sure of that much.",

I don't trust places that call themselves bbq anything but don't serve beef ribs, among other things.As an American who has come to realize that while in London I will not get the type, and portions, of food I am used to (and love)... the place isn't too bad.Went on a Monday evening. There was quite a wait for a table so we, party of 3 plus a kid, took a smaller bar table. I'd recommend reservations.We ordered all you can eat big pig, king crab legs, St. Louis spareribs, voodoo wings, mac & cheese, and kid's ribs.The portions are damn good compared to what I have seen since being here (except the crab, more on that later). However, the meat is not seasoned, at all. It's cooked plain, THEN they throw some bbq sauce on it. That's not how you do it, guys. All you can eat was fine. Chicken was pretty good. Bbq baked beans. Ahhh. Canned, but, I haven't had any in months, so it seemed like heaven. *cue images of the 'Bush's baked beans' dog trying to sell me the recipe*The crab legs? Don't bother, it was about 2 king crab legs, cut up and scattered on a plate to make it appear to be more than it was. 22 pounds for that? Negative. It was sent back for crab shack combo, except there weren't any crab claws or mussels left. Crab shack combo then became the shrimp basket. The shrimp were pretty big, typical battered deal. Zero taste though. Tarter sauce helped a bit, but, well, no.St.. Louis ribs are supposed to be meatier than regular ribs, but, \u00a0*whispers* they lie. Bottom of the slab didn't even have sauce on it. The kids ribs came with sauce on the side? Como? Que? No bueno. My son, a bbq monster, was not happy lol. I wish I had a picture of the look of sheer confusion on his face. He dug in anyway but only ate 2 ribs then filled up on fries. The idea of having to dip the ribs in sauce is just wrong; It's not a chicken finger.Voodoo wings were decent, you only get 5 though. I was pretty shocked by that. The mac & cheese was ok too. The vibe was nice though. Laid back. I'd go back for drinks with friends and maybe have something to eat, but definitely won't be returning just for food.",

Under normal circumstances this would be fine, but had the service been more efficient and had we not had to wait for over 20 minutes for our plates to be cleared, we would not have had this issue. \u00a370 later, we left feeling slightly deflated. Better luck next time!",

    "text": "The Big Easy is a great place to go if you do one thing before you get there - manage your own expectations.If you've got any friends who have been to the Big Easy, they will have waxed lyrical about the food, the ambience, the food, the atmosphere and finally the huge portions of food. None of this is incorrect - the food is fantastic (calamari is solid, the steaks are hefty to say the least and for those of us who are not so much brave as stupid the two person desserts are incredible) and the ambience really is stellar if you get the night right. There is a band that play downstairs pretty regularly, typically a Wednesday/Thursday/Sunday who have the same set list every time they play (doesn't particularly bother me as I'm still listening to Ocean Colour Scene roughly 18 years since they were relevant) who really are good, and the bloke in the group sings happy birthday in whichever musical genre you wish (ask for opera. It's genius). It's also, for where it is located really good for price - steaks are better in my opinion than the MPW just down the road and are cheaper, and the all you can eat nights are epic (although you do occasionally have to remind the waiters that they should bring out the same size portion each time you ask for more - beware the shrinking portions).That said, there are a few things that occasionally leave a bit of a sour taste in the mouth, especially for first timers to The Big Easy, and hence, manage your own expectations. The Big Easy is REALLY busy. Even on a Sunday, you will have to book quite a sizeable time in advance, and it isn't just busy, but B.U.S.Y and slightly cramped. You won't have a huge table, and you won't really be getting a huge amount of personal space for the next 90 minutes (this is the sacrifice you make when you get a great atmosphere). Food can also, because it is so busy, occasionally take a little bit longer than you were anticipating, so be ready for this. All in all though, if you can accept that this place is here for three main reasons - big portions of food, great/loud atmosphere and the experience and can put aside any pretence that you're going to be having a reserved, candle-lit meal you're onto a winner and you won't find many places that serve better food more consistently.Also, I don't care what anyone says, hearing KT Tunstall's opus \"suddenly I see\" being belted out just before a guy goes operatic on \"Happy Birthday\" never gets old.(This place is good for groups if you can book in advance and get the downstairs room - you can be as loud and boisterous as you want and you get slightly quicker service in my experience on the all you can eat ribs)",

The steak is also delicious, cooked just how you like it...rear, medium rear, medium or well done.The decor is simple, relaxed, you feel like you are walking into a ranch, horses tied up outside, cowboy boots on the table and the smell of sizzling meat, random sayings dotted around...'gone fishing'. Just a great place. They also have big screens so you can watch big American sports games.They often have live music on a Friday and Saturday, good beat really setting the scene!",

Anything my friends ordered fried was delicious...like the fried shrimp inexplicably covered in hot wing sauce. \u00a0Salads - don't even go there. \u00a0My friend had some rendition with packaged shredded cheese, canned vegetables and a few artfully placed pieces of lettuce. I had the shrimp fajitas...the tortilla's tasted like Old El Paso, there was nary a mexican spice on it, and guacamole was definitely the kind which comes from a plastic tub made by Kraft. However, with the amount of tequila I consumed, I could care less which brings me to...Second point - you do go here for the Frozen Margheritas. \u00a0If only for the glory of watching the ice whirl around in the multiple jugs behind the bar. \u00a0It brings me back to my college days when the bar down the street had Margherita Mondays (only $1!). \u00a0You can get any flavour (I prefer passion fruit) but ask for salt, not sugar on the rim of the glass.Third, you absolutely, positively go here for the live music. \u00a0On a Sunday night, they had a great cover band downstairs playing every top 40 hit from the 80's to today...we found ourselves singing along with Kenny Loggins, Britney, and Robbie Williams. \u00a0Cheesy pop sounds better when sung wholeheartedly...with drunken accompaniment.",

We enjoyed - grazed on / devoured - the Surf and Turf on Thursday night, 3 of the friends I went with had been a month previously and raved about it so I was expecting good things.....and wasn't disappointed. I'm not too much of a steak fan but loved this especially with the delish blue cheese sauce on top and shock horror was up until this night a lobster virgin and loved this. I also enjoyed the lime margarita that came with the surf and turf deal. We also quickly got through the amazing pork scratchings with apple sauce that our waitress had recommended to us. The service was really friendly and quick (especially as a friend of ours that we thought wasn't turning up, did and although he ordered about 20 minutes after us didn't have to wait too long after our food came out, only about another ten minutes). The only problem we had was that one of my friends and I had ordered friends with our surf and turf and they gave us a jacket potato instead, when we said this, they simply brought out fries too - good customer service! As if we weren't getting fat enough though!! There was also really good live entertainment from a couple singing and playing live music who were excellent.Be warned, you will leave feeling very full and fat so pre-warning make sure you come feeling hungry!! Recommended for a fun night - we can't wait to return for Shrimp Night on a Tuesday! - good service and fab and tasty food!",

    "text": "Sometimes I hesitate to give a place like this more than 3 stars. \u00a0Feels like I'm falling into a trap where cheap seafood meal deals override quality & service. \u00a0I really hope not, but I've been to this location twice, and once to their new location in Covent Garden, and have been pretty happy both times (though, I can't say I recommend the CG location!)The atmosphere is slightly stuffy, and most of the time, the tables are so close to each other that your butt will knock over a few things as you try to squeeze your way out to the restroom. For food that cheap that gets pumped out routinely, I wasn't going to have high expectations. \u00a0But man, it was good, and I hope they do have a high rate of consistency, as our party was very happy both times! The first time around, Cheryl & I got the unlimited fried shrimp basket which came with tartar sauce, fries, coleslaw, and a margarita for \u00a317. \u00a0I can't say much for the margarita - its a slush and comes out of a machine, and I didn't enjoy it very much, but its the standard drink that comes with most deals. \u00a0The deal is so cheap already, I'll happily pay for a different drink or milkshake from the menu. The popcorn shrimp was definitely hot, fresh and crispy! Loved the crunch of the shrimp, and it was so delicious! \u00a0Refills give you about 4 pieces, usually without fries unless you want more fries as well. We EACH got a side of mac n cheese (\u00a33-4?). \u00a0All the mac n cheese sides I've ordered are usually a tiny dish, and Cheryl & I are pigs, we admit it - we can usually finish our own sides. \u00a0But holy cow, for that price, we each were given a large dish of mac! it was tasty, and more than generously sized! We hardly dented our sides, and had to take it home. \u00a0Second time, I had the whole 1.5lb lobster (includes fries and marg) for \u00a320. \u00a0It was my first whole lobster, and it was cooked really nicely! The flesh was nice and bouncy, not solid & chewy at all! Clarified butter was good, and I did a number on the lobster licked clean every crack and crevice! Definitely great value and tasty for that price! Others were happy with their steak / rib dishes. \u00a0Cooked really well, and tender, fall off the bone meat for the ribs. \u00a0Also, please be cautious of the amount of food you order! These dishes ARE big, so if you do need an appy or side, order 1 between 2 people (especially if you are here on an unlimited night), \u00a0If you usually pack up leftovers, then thats fine - but that comment was mainly directed at those who don't usually bother with leftovers. \u00a0I've seen so much food wastage here because some people don't realise how large the dishes are! \u00a0Anyway, I've been happy both times, the quality was consistent, and I hope that if I come back here down the line, it'll continually be good!",

    "text": "I went to Big Easy with a Big Group, and unfortunately, it just didn't work in our favor. I'd like to think this was the result of having an early reservation we struggled to make, a party too big, and a space too small. But it could also have been the food prepared en masse, the lack of friendly service, or the overwhelmingly American atmosphere... And I'm an American saying that.I can see what would make Big Easy charming--they offer a distinctly American experience at a reasonable price, with a huge array of menu options and flavors that just aren't commonly found in the UK. Certainly, I got the impression I was in a crab shack by the atmosphere and sensory overload. Unfortunately, it just didn't come together very well for me and my group, and in a city of so many amazing options, I can't say I'll aim to go back.",

    "text": "This restaurant came highly recommended by a colleague, but I am very surprised that I didn't find this American establishment myself. It has an American flag hanging just inside the door, and country bands that come from the US to play live! With just a glance at the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted: the crab shack combo for some much missed good seafood. I was with a friend that had also lived in the States, and we also ordered the deep fried calamari and a half rack of baby back ribs to cover all the bases. I loved the seafood combo, but have a few suggestions: it would have been better with more prawns (I only saw a few) vs. the mostly mussels selection thrown in there, to pre-crack the two crab claws, halve the potatoes, and it would also be amazing if they had a Southern-style cajun sauce available (you're called the Big Easy, for heavens sake...), even though the garlic white wine sauce was good too! The rib portion was enormous... we easily had 4-5 ribs each, and it comes with coleslaw and beans, so there is plenty to go around. I also liked that the place had Blue Moon, which was one of my favourite beers back in the States, but I found it weird that they did not have any beers or ciders on tap (bottles only). Then around the 9 pm mark, there was live music which seemed to be coming from downstairs, and I bet it would be really cool to come back for a gig. Overall, this was a refreshing bit of Americana in London and a very lively place with some great food!",

Was very good but has gone downhill. 3x I have been and won't go back.1st time- service terrible while there were only 5 occupied tables.Ordered the voodoo wings and then ribs and chicken lunch. Voodoo wings dry and to camouflage that fact covered with the hot sauce, very bad.Ribs were good but chicken dry..2nd time- service better this time went over the weekend so no lunch special.Decided to order the same to see whether previous time was just a one off of dried chicken.Exactly the same!!!! 3rd time- service was good but they forgot an item with every course we ordered!Ordered again the wings to test, again dry! Sent them back and then the manager stated the chef was making a fresh new one. Within 5 minutes I had a new one ( impossible in that time fresh and new) it looked the same portion just more sauce dropped over it to camouflage the dryness. Then they forgot the extra blue cheese sauce which I ordered and was charged 2.75!???Main was the burger... Never get this if you like rare to medium burger as they ONLY do medium well to well. Really dry and on top of that forgot to bring the fries?!!! I mean really with a burger??!!Not sure whether the way they serve their meat is a reflection on how bad it might be that they will only serve it from medium-well upwards.All in all after these 3 attempts have decided that Big easy is off my list, even though the week lunch is a great deal. No deal can compensate for bad food. So bye bye Big Easy.",

The jumbo shrimp were nice and plump but the \"tempura\" batter was more like pub style fish batter. The accompanying voodoo hot sauce was tasty - similar to the hot sauce you get with buffalo wings. The clam chowder was on the generous size but pretty heavy with all the potato and cream that went into it. The smokey bacon gave it a great flavour but overall left me pretty full before the main course.Our orders of rib and chicken combos were pretty standard. Both meats were probably precooked and reheated before serving. The BBQ sauce that was basted on top was a poor attempt to add flavour and moisten the already dry meat.We were served by a very friendly and accommodating waitress. A live band started playing around 9pm to liven the mood. Overall, I think I'd stick to Bodeans.",

And yes they do have actually quite tasty chicken fingers served with honey mustard dipping sauce. I went here for the 4th of July festivities (be sure to book in advance), and they had a special---all you can eat ribs and chicken for about 15 pounds/head....score! On the main menu of the restaurant they have \u00a0a margarita bar --- with a wide selection of pre-made slushy style margaritas. We should have gone with the slushies as I asked the bar tender to make a margarita on the rocks and it was vile. It was just tequila (he forgot the lime and triple sec), upon mentioning that my drink was colourless and foul he added a splash of triple-sec. Really? Come on..Big Easy you need to train your bartenders...anyone working behind a margarita bar should know how to make margaritas!?!That said, I was pleased with the BBQ fare and the overall party atmosphere definitely reminded me of the states.

However, we had a great meal Thursday night. I had the steak fajitas (\u00a316.95), which were generous in portion and tasty. The steak had a nice char to it, but there could have been a bit more of it as the three tortillas only had a little bit each. Lots of onions and peppers, and the guac/salsa on the side were delicious. 7/10. My strawberry margarita was excellent. My husband had the lobster roll (\u00a316.95) which had 1 pound of lobster in it, and came with a side salad and chips. Good portion size, and he devoured it quickly. He rates it 9/10 - no complaints, but he hates giving out perfect scores. He loved the classic margarita as well. Our food was very good, the vibe was fun and casual, and the service was friendly if slow. Dessert looked great, but we were too stuffed.I got a membership card in the mail the next day, too! Nice surprise perk. Would definitely recommend the margaritas and will happily go back to try some BBQ.",

With nary an explanation or reason to support his demand that they leave. Even so, it's a mistake that is somewhat hard to forgive.Not cool, sir, not cool at all.",

Well worth a try for meat lovers who like to get their hands dirty. Bare in mind they've also got a site in Covent Garden with a much bigger space and a wider selection of spirits and cocktails.",

It could be the dim lighting or the friendly staff or just the smell of BBQ. I've been there with big groups, small groups and just by myself and it's always nice experience. Like yesterday, I was having a bad day and I just wanted to wallow in a bowl of messy saucy wings. So I went to Big Easy and did just that. The place was packed, so I stood by the bar and devoured my wings quietly. The bartender was very nice and attentive. He didn't judge my caveman style eating at the bar, instead he brought me a bunch of wet wipes with a smile. Anyway so I went home feeling satiated and slightly drunk (yes I always chugged 2 glasses of wine caveman-style with the wings).There's no bad day a bowl of wings and a glass of wine (or 2) can't fix!",

    "text": "My GF and I had been looking forward to this place for a while and wanted to try out the lobster and something a little different hence choosing this place.We booked in for Sunday and arrived about 10 minutes early, was told to wait at the bar whilst they sorted the table. I was driving so had a coke and she fancied a chocolate milkshake, although really busy the barman came over pretty quick, we ordered and was told they had just run out of chocolate ice cream!?? so we both opt'd for Coke. Now I know what Coke tastes like and I have no idea what this was, it was a combination of flat KFC Pepsi or some random no name brand cola but hey ho it's only a drink.After about a 5 minute wait we were shown to our table which was already empty as I noticed it when I walked in so I assume the bar trip was to get us to buy drinks, cutlery wise the table had only a knife on each on there as people were taking forks from other tables due to the person that brings the food out forgetting to bring the forks (I think they have dedicated waiters and food servers)To start we had the Lobster Cocktails which were really nice, we then asked for the 1 1/4 Lobster but was informed that they had run out so she had the ribs and I had the burger (that did not include fries), the ribs were nice however the burger was grim. It was just bland and chewy and the bread just dried it all out and it had that cooked at the same time as the starters and left under the lights warmth to it. The fries (\u00a33.60) were just over salted over cooked fries and the coleslaw was just coleslaw.The bill for 3 so called Cokes (not inc bar drinks) and food came to \u00a358 which included the 12% tip in there so you have no option but to just pay this, don't get me wrong I do pay tips where warranted but to have it forced upon you is just wrong!The place was in a good location, the decor was good and don't get me wrong it must be popular as the days we wanted to go were fully booked and it was full when we arrived but on this occasion the food didn't pop or wow us, it was just food.Would I try it again, maybe as I think it could be nice if the right item was chosen.",

Both came with beans (great) and coleslaw (tasteless and gross). We preferred the regular ribs to his Kansas ribs and loved the sauce. The cornbread muffin as a side was good, too. The two ladies at the check in area were very sweet and helpful! Our server was great too, until he gave me the credit card machine and circled with his finger where it asked if I wanted to leave a tip! I thought that was unnecessary as I can read, and with the service charge already included on top of his action, I didn't give an extra tip. Would suggest he not be so forward next time as it is awkward and not necessary.I would recommend this place to others looking for good bbq baby back ribs!",

The portions are huge! Flavour town supreme from the moment you walk in and best of all they are so reasonably priced its not right! They have a lunch time menu which is just \u00a310 and you get a starter,main course and a frozen margarita/beer or wine... Lord give me strength that's a bargain baby!Downside is that its got that old western theme which makes the interior a little dark and hot (not hot in rihanna hot but hot in there are one too many shady people in this lift with me so I need to get out hot) ....

Although we have pre-booked, we were (craftily) directed to wait at the bar. There really isn't much room in the venue, so we tucked ourselves against the bar, absent mindedly dancing around other patrons and the staff, to order and recieve our cocktails before being seated downstairs. Happy hour goes on till 7pm though, which is a plus. The venue is sizeable, partly because they have stacked the tables and chairs very close to each other so that once you are seated, you feel cacooned by the decor and other diners. There was a band literally sat on top of another set of diners; on the evening we visited, the sound system wasn't working so the live band couldn't play. In some way we were a little glad that we weren't deafened at the \"front row\" to the small stage. The food is great and portion size incredible - a piece of Americana in Chealsea. Being from the states, I have had my fair share of incredulous steak and ribs and BBQ food, but this comes pretty close, if not on taste than certainly on portion size. The two of us had the sharing platter - ribs, chicken, coleslaw, beans, cornbread muffin and fries. More than enough food to feed a small family!",

We were seated quite rapidly but away from most diners in a corner. The server was initially polite and chatted with us for a bit and took our order--fajitas, steak sandwich, and a kids bbq ribs. The food was good, but the poor service was what left the lasting impression. We felt neglected and it appeared that other tables were being well tended to. I had to get up and flag someone down a few times during our meal because our initial server disappeared after taking our order, and only reappeared as we were leaving.

    "text": "Small and difficult, not big and easy. If you are a Brit looking for a slice of Americana with a lot of noise then you will likely like this place a lot. If you have spent much time living or working in the South or the Midwest then you'll find this place cramped, with pretty poor service and a bit run down.Don't get me wrong, the staff are actually pretty good for London but they are sorely lacking compared to the service in even the average US diner. Hard to get the attention of the wait staff. All of them really rushed, don't really have the time to engage with you--let alone give you a big smile and welcome you. Difficult to have them check a bag (they actually don't have anywhere). In fact every surface in the room is actually eating or walking, it is really a tight fit in there. Our table was really cramped, barely enough room to get everyone seated and I felt as though I was constantly being brushed up against by the wait staff, our chairs were right up against the gangway. There was a loose floorboard under my chair so that every time someone went past my chair jiggled up and down. The food and drinks are mostly good and the drinks are authentic enough. I'd give them 3.5 stars there maybe as many as 4 for the lobster.The kids had ribs and wolfed them down--didn't even get to try them. Son the younger didn't like his mac and cheese. I didn't like the side of it that we ordered either. You get a timed booking and then two hours for your slot. I'm not sure what happens after that time but I suspect it would be neither big nor easy. I feel bad comparing this to an American diner but there you have it. We travelled quite a way across London to get our US fix (we used to live there) and Big Easy was a bit of a let down. There is no way we would bother taking a special group all the way over there again. The experience just isn't that great. But if you are in the area and fancy some good ribs or lobster, and like a hustly atmosphere, then you'll probably like it far more than I did.Sorry Big Easy!",

I know I was hungry a whole day before our booking for this food! The food options was a little bit confusing at first as we had to choose from the set menu which was an option out of 3 which were the BBQ blow out at \u00a325pp, the surf & turf at \u00a330 person and finally the seafood deluxe at \u00a335pp. The set menu has a variety of starters and mains including a selection of desserts at an additional \u00a35.50. At first I initially thought this place was on the pricey side as I believe you get to choose one starter and main from the selection but I was well and truly wrong, you get everything I mean you get a range of starters and mains like a kings banquet being served out on huge silver trays. The disappointing thing was I couldn't get my seafood deluxe order as their needed to be a minimum of 2 people ordering any of the set menu and as there was 9 of us the maths didn't add up to my expense. However, I had the chance to Oder from the regular menu which now seemed more pricey especially once you witnessed the size of the platter that came out for the set menus. I was actually lucky enough to try everyone else's starter as their was more than enough to go around meaning that I only had to purchase just a main course. Now after we went through mussels with shrimp in a white wine sauce and a course of buffalo wings, Nacho crisps with dips and a delicious tasting garlic bread I think we all knew desserts were out of the window. In fact I was a little worried I would finish my sirloin steak with deep fried battered shrimp and creamy mashed potatoes, but nevertheless we all pursue to finish of our food and to be honest I was the only one that did. I just didn't understand why my mashed looked like vanilla ice cream? \u00a0The hospitality and service were really good as our waiter and host made us all to feel welcomed so much so we all remembered their names, crystal, Tim and halo we can only say thanks for a great evening to remember. So would I go back again, yes. It's a great spot to go after work, with your partner, family and friends.",

The rest of the table ordered different things, and I was told the chicken fajita was quite bland too.

I usually eat baby back ribs accompanied by 2 massive prawns (turf & surf) as the Americans call it. It's delicious with a good helping of coleslaw on the side.To my delight they now have also a selection of lobsters up to 6lb for a very reasonable price and the menu is full of good American food. Seating upstairs is better as is less noisy than downstairs when the band plays. Almost every day of the week they have a eat as much as you can. Each day a different dish. The service is usually friendly and somehow fast. However they change their staff often. The two barmen are very friendly and capable to serve you a selections of drinks and cocktails and happy hour is everyday except Sunday. All in all the place is great the food is great and the atmosphere too.",

The chicken tenders are also delicious as a starter as are the Stuffed Jalape\u00f1o Peppers. \u00a0BBQ chicken is also rewarding and mixing ribs and chicken is probably the way forward. \u00a0It's easy to get very stuffed in here and that is a bit of an issue because it is very, very cramped. \u00a0They really pack 'em in! \u00a0They'll also want the table back after 2 hours so they can ferry more hungry punters in, so bear that in mind - this is a not a lazy, relaxing joint, but a fast paced, mouth stuffing frenzy of protein, carbs, beer and cocktails. \u00a0Just don't go for the music - chances are you won't be able to see the band on their tiny stage, and even if you can it doesn't look especially good or sound especially great, so it's all about the food for me. \u00a0Service is generally good, but not award winning by any measure. \u00a0Recommended.",

    "text": "The Big Easy is one of those places that seems to have graced London's King's Road forever. I've played swapatop here and spilled barbecue sauce down my front and slurped on far too many frozen margaritas, not necessarily all at the same time. Recently it was my task to book somewhere fun for a reunion of pals, so we went to the Big Easy. I have to say that the margaritas were great while I was waiting (2 4 1 happy hour) but because all my friends were late (shame on them) we ended up being hurried along once too often during the evening because of the restaurant's 2 hour table turnaround policy. Because of this stupid (!) policy they nearly lost out on our dessert custom and I will definitely not be going back in a hurry unless it's on a Monday night when the staff are likely to be less pushed to move people on. The wine was average (shoulda stuck to the margaritas)and the food was served in generous portions, as always, but it just didn't taste as great as I remembered it. The onion rings were a bit more Burger King than Big Easy although the stuffed jalapeno peppers were still pretty good, but the deep fried jumpo prawns tasted as if they'd been sitting around for a while and refried at the last minute.I went for the Crabshack Combo as my main and although the mussels, prawns and claws were good, the potatoes were diappointingly mediocre and the garlic white wine sauce seemed to lack any indication that its two main ingredients - garlic and white wine - had been in any way involved in its creation. Somehow managed to squeeze in some cheesecake, but because the waitress couldn't decide if we could keep our table a little bit longer or not, we almost missed out on dessert altogether and when we were permitted to proceed with ordering the last part of our meal, we were told to eat up in 15 minutes, so I'm afraid that ruined it for me. We liked the margaritas, the atmosphere, the live music and the stuffed jalapenos. We didn't like the booking system, being rushed through our meal or the refried deep fried taste of some of the food. Come on, Big Easy, you can do better! I give you 3 stars for nostalgia's sake and the hope that you can get back to the standards you used to uphold.",

    "text": "This place is something of an anomaly, and I'm not really sure what it's trying to be \u00a0a self-proclaimed BBQ and Crab Shack that's also won a Wine Spectator award! Now, I love BBQ and seafood and wine, but I'm not sure I can recall the last time I had all three at the same place! Oh yeah, and they're known for their tasty margaritas too! Weird Anyway, we started with a couple of margaritas \u00a0clementine & ginger for Meg, passion fruit & chile for me. Mine was painfully sweet, and hers was OK, but we generally like to taste our booze instead of being tricked into drinking it, so these weren't really a huge hit with either of us. We opted for bottles of Dos Equis to go with our meals. The menu is huge \u00a0there must have been 75 items on it. The best way I can describe this restaurant (and everything about it) is that it's Dock's (a well-known seafood mini-chain in NYC) meets Brother Jimmy's (another NYC mini-chain which has the same motto as the Big Easy, put a little South in your mouth). The d\u00e9cor definitely swung the way of Brother Jimmy's \u00a0Christmas lights, US license plates, plank walls, etc. I think the desired effect is to make you feel like you're in a Cajun crab shack (albeit one that serves BBQ and huge steaks and Alsatian wines), but it felt a bit contrived to me. An added bonus \u00a0this place played great music. During the first part of our meal, they were piping in southern rock: CCR, the Black Crowes (!!!) and a little Tom Petty for good measure. Later in the evening, a cover band started playing upstairs; they were pretty good, and were definitely playing crowd favorites like Oasis, Jack Johnson, U2, the Foo Fighters, etc. The place is clearly catering to American expats looking for a bit of home. We started our meal with the Voodoo chicken wings. I was hoping for Buffalo-style (these weren't), but these did not disappoint. Fairly spicy and a homemade bleu cheese dressing on the side. The chicken was breaded though, and that didn't go over great with either of us. Overall, they were pretty delicious. After we polished off our order of 5 wings, the waiter brought over hot towels \u00a0a nice touch, especially considering that we were both covered in wing sauce. For our entrees, we decided that we would order baby back ribs and a half of a roasted chicken and share. Big mistake. The portions were HUGE, and I suspect that we were fed some genetically modified, mutant (though delicious) chicken. Meg thought the ribs were good, but I thought they were a bit overcooked. Both featured the same BBQ sauce, which was pretty good, but a little sweet for my liking. On the side of both plates (really platters) were huge portions of coleslaw and BBQ baked beans. The coleslaw was just OK, but the beans were great, if for no other reason than they weren't of the ubiquitous Heinz canned variety. Everything made for delicious leftovers on Wednesday night! Total damage: \u00a366. We don't think that we would hurry to come back here, but it could be a fun place to catch a baseball or football game (they have NASN too!) and hang with some expats.",

After waiting outside for about 30 minutes, a table opened up outside and we sat down. We were asked if we wanted to stay outside and we decided we would. About 5 minutes later, it started raining so we went back inside to ask if we can have our name reinstated as we were going to get soaked outside. She said that she could only add our name to the bottom of the list which would mean another 30 minute wait. She said that if we have already been seated, we aren't able to get any priority over anyone else. Even though we hadn't been served or had time to even place our orders outside, as far as she was concerned, we were committed to that table even if it meant getting soaked in the rain. The hostess's attitude was appalling and she had no interest in helping us have a better experience at the restaurant. After waiting another 15 minutes, we left and had a wonderful meal next door at Maroush which I highly recommend!",

We accepted graciously and sat down. \u00a0We were seated less than one minute when the hostess came back and told us it was a mistake, this table was reserved (mind you, the room is 3/4 empty!).

We decided to Order some Oysters and Voodoo Chicken for starters and ordered the Special Offer of Steak and Lobster. The restaurant was very busy so we were happy waiting a while for our starters. After 40 minutes we noticed that something was wrong as everyone who was seated after us had already received their food and we were still waiting. I asked a waitress if she could check where our food was and after 5 minutes was told that the order had gone missing ( Later we were told that a new waitress had taken our food to the wrong table ) and that they would try and rush the order through again. After another 15 minutes our starters came although the Voodoo Chicken had turned into Voodoo Shrimp that had to be sent back and we waited for the Chicken. Finally we had the starters and as we were finishing the main meals were served. The food was nice as I had expected. We looked at the desert menu and decided to be really brave and try and order The Melted Chocolate Pudding but were advised that they did not have any so I asked for the bill. Although they had not added service to our bill I did send it back and the waitress removed our drinks (Aprox 10% of the bill). I don't usually complain but on this occasion I really thought they only deserved to get 10% not 90% of the bill. I must stress that I have been to The Big Easy on numerous occasions and have never had any issues before. I had previously mentioned to my friends & family how amazing the food and service was there. Possibly the issues on the night were due to new staff but I still believe that even after speaking with the manager they could have dealt with the situation better. As it was my fianc\u00e9's first time there and the last experience I would expect it to be a while for us to return.",

However there was something a little off.

With its neon lit signs and and its menu options and interior decorations, i feel they did well in creating the american illusion.But i wasn't here for having pancakes ... i was recommended the \"british\" steak ... and thats what i ordered ... a well done New York sirloin with french fries and bearnaise sauce. The steak was very tasty ... and not too expensive for its size ... under \u00a320. The great thing was that the size of the steak was mentioned in grams and not in ounces ... and so for once i had some idea about how much i was about to eat :)I had ordered a long island iced tea. It was good but not very strong ... but that was ok for a lunchtime drink i guess. At \u00a37.45, it was a bit of a disappointment though. There are a number of 2 for 1 options if you order at the bar.The menu had a number of seafood options and it seems big easy is known for its lobsters. I am not a great fan of them in restaurants as i find them difficult to handle with cutlery ... but i am tempted to go back here just for the lobsters.The service was again american. The person serving me bothered to talk to me and have a chat ... something i associate with NYC and not at all with London.Overall i thought it was worth it for me to come all the way to chelsea this time just for having the steak outside in glorious sunshine :)",

You'll almost certainly have to book ahead on any given night. For a whole night out it has a bar, you can watch sport on big screens, the food is tremendous, and they host live music (usually bluesy tunes) downstairs every night from about 8.30/9ish. If you're planning to go here, have a light meal about 6 hours before going to, so that you can build up an appetite for the kind of portions that make you feel they source fresh seafood and meat from Jurassic Park. It's not just the size though, this place delivers quality too. Of course, being on the Kings Road, this doesn't really come cheaply but you do at least get what you pay for. Worth trying is The Big Pig Gig on Monday nights: an all-you-can-eat barbecue of ribs and chicken with beans, coleslaw and a beer for about \u00a315.",

    "text": "I had such a great night here last night, but this was lots to do with fabulous Qypers alongside a pretty nice place to eat. I congratulate whoever it was who came up with 'Qype Meat-up'. Brilliant idea. I was a wee bit late, but this is mostly London's fault. And also, it's a bit of a fib on the Big Easy website when they say that they're near Sloane Square. They're a 15 minute walk away! But we got there and I was handed a margerhita (strawberry. Very yummy. Not as strong as the blackberry ones.) Then I settled in on 'the cool table' - we were a bit group so we were split in two. I was all up for having steak, but then I spied the specials board and saw that they had scallops! (They do a fair bit of seafood so this isn't that strange). I am powerless before a scallop. Really. Once I've spied them on the menu, it isn't possible for me to focus on anything else. And they were brilliant. Slightly overcooked by my reckoning, but that's me being very fussy. There was lots of them about 8-10 which is a huge amount of scallops! My little basket of food actually looked quite tiny but I swear I couldn't have eaten another thing. Everyone seemed happy. I swapped coleslaw for The Duck's onion rings and well, they weren't brilliant, but then I swapped scallop for steak and that was brilliant. We were all very happy fat Qypers. The dessert menu wasn't brilliant. There was nothing that could tempt me, but by that time I was getting brain freeze from the frozen margs. It's difficult not to compare this place to Bodeans - where the first meat-up was - I liked the live music in here and the place had a bit more of an atmosphere. Staff were brilliant too. Friendly and helpful. But I think I preferred the food (and the prices) in Bodean's. But the evening was still great. Just jump on a bus from the tube to get here if you're running late and don't drink icey drinks to fast.",

But a crab shack on Kings Road that offers authentic American cuisine (but then so does Burger King).I may sound slightly bitter and cynical but then so would you if you had just shared the most intimate of experiences with Kelly Brook only to be told by her the next day that the gates were now closed. The all you can eat fajitas (when offering shrimp) are possibly one of the greatest things known to man - after the Dyson Airblade that is. The steak is a char-grilled caramel affair on the outside and lipstick pink and plump when cut. The chicken dances with flavour like a Mexican flamenco and the shrimps are the size of tennis balls, in a sticky, sweet-chilli dip that creates (as the hairy bikers would put it) a flavour-bomb of goliath proportions. I felt like Henry VIII on his Birthday; minus the wives, of course. Sweating with excitement I ate until my eyes bulged and my belly swelled up like I had had a heavy night popping too much Silica gel. My next brush with 'Easy Chelsea' however was not as fun. She seemed a bit offish, uninterested and unconcerned about providing such a memorable experience again. I played it save by initiating the all you can eat jobby, I thought. This time however, when my plate had been revealed I could not see any trace of the delicate flesh I so desired and lusted after. Goodbye Mr Shrimp. Sweating, I asked the waitress why this Chelsea lass was being so coy and not surrendering to my carnal appetite? The Shrimp is no longer part of the dealio she replied, nonchalantly pursing her lips like a duck's bottom that had become wrinkled from the afternoon Sun. Now this is where Iphones come in handy. Cleverly \u00a0I fingered the website for this easy chick and up popped her vitals \u00a0All you can eat fajitas; Steak, Shrimp and Chicken. There she was showing her 'tic-tacs' in all their glory. I showed this to the waitress and then the Manager and after much debate I got my one last dying wish. For Shrimps. All three of them. And that was that. I didn't want to rock the boat, I guess, and try with my little puppies (my eyes that is) to obtain more of my fishy friends. Mr Shrimp received the royal pardon and did not end-up smothered in molten hot sweet-chilli sauce with a sharp metal rod shoved where the sun don't shine, showing everyone his breakfast. I was stuck with the chick-chick and the boeuf. I mean in any other restaurant I would have been satiated and I may have even campaigned to give the head chef a knighthood. But not the 'easy! Imagine going to a Thai massage parlour and been made to leave before the 'happy ending'. You would feel short changed and renounce the establishment for years to, er come. And unfortunately that's how Easy Chelsea left me reeling. If only she could get her act together and start offering the 'full service' again she would be worth another go. Until that time I'll be trying something other than just a shrimp tease.",

The chips were very good. And the special comes with a glass of wine. The wine list was extensive. The menu's large, and other people report that ther lobster was good. The ribs were large and reportedly good, too. Upstairs seems to get a bit of a vibe boost from having the bar and the windows to the street. Downstairs is just a big room of people chowing down. Biggest complaint: the recorded music was too loud and a bit on the annoying side. A couple of guys with guitars came on about 8:30pm to play a set of easy-listening (Brown Eyed Girl, etc) tunes downstairs which was a bit better. You get lots of food, and there's lots of choice. But the whole place is a bit too earnest, cluttered and American for me to really enjoy it.",

No beers on draught and unable to drink bottled beer when I know how much they are at wholesale prices, I saw the margaritas in slush puppie style machines and ordered a Blackberry one. I recieved two and notification that these were the rules of 'happy hour'. They were amazingmaybe too amazing.

Then a gorgeous glass of Malbec arrived under my nose my the ever so smiley waitress. Brilliant. Without much delay my 8oz steak arrived. I was starving having missed lunch and it was really good. Cooked perfectly as I had requested so I would rate their steak here on both taste and decancy grounds. Although as it was a cheapo offer I got the billed couple of salad leaves, small to medium size portion of chips and onion rings which were wholly dissapointing, though large. A band came onto the stage behind me and delivered covers, whilst the lovely Siany swapped Scallop and slaw for steak. Gorgeousthe food is really good here. As the meal was finished and (mostly) empty plates from happy eaters were collected I made a beeline for that important after dinner smoke. Good shelter for smokers too even if it is under a little awning on the street. The toilets (restrooms) were a little odd. The band playing live downstairs were piped through speakers into the toilet. Never had I expereinced that before. Not even somewhere like a concert venue where you pay to hear the musicians perform. Good trick I think as I take in the Americana all over the walls in the toilet. Nice to see the theme being kept to at all times, because as others would have noted this place is very Americana. As I return downstairs I see a snippet from an undated Evening standard newspaper article about the big easy's 3,500 calorie \u00a340 2lb steak and lobster meal. It takes 25 mins to cook the steak because of its size!!! Madness! It is temping for one day but in the meantime I think I will just get some Monday night all-you-can-eat rib for \u00a315 practise in before the 2008 rib rack contest title is held. Of course I will be arriving early for 2 for 1 margaritas and booking the table for 7.30pm. Anyone want to join me?",

I came here in a Christmas shopping daze, to refuel and have a couple drinks. My Californian male friend was suitably lulled by the sport and after an hour or so we were ready to face the crowds again.",

    "text": "This place is awesome. If you want to absolutely stuff your face with great tasting American food then look no further. Two words: Fajitas, Ribs. That's all you need to know. Mondays for Ribs and Wednesdays for Faijtas. For 15 quid you get all you can eat AND a drink. Not only that, they may even let you take home a whole extra portion of Fajitas. Who does that on an 'all you can eat' deal!? It sucks there is only one location and that you have it trek it down Kings Road for 20 minutes to get there from the tube but man is it worth it. The food is good quality. It's not the Ritz but it definitely delivers. You may not realize how difficult it is to find steak in this City that's chewable without spending next year's bonus but that's what you get and so much more. I'm sure this reads like a ridiculous rant but that's what this place deserves. Having said all that, if you show up and order something other than ribs or fajitas off the a la carte menu I can't vouch for it, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Go on diners, enjoy.",
