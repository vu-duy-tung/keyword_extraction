The service was fine - they actually seemed over-staffed. \u00a0The atmosphere was quaint and classy - we nearly forgot about the busy street we'd walked in from. \u00a0The prices were very reasonable - considering the quality of the food, I'd say we got more than our money's worth.All in all, it was a really nice meal to top off a great day. Recommended!",

We mentioned that we were seeing the show at 7.30pm - the waiter assured us that he'd ensure that we ate/drank/paid and left in time for the show.He wasn't wrong! We had such great service, there was no lag at all. \u00a0We even had time for starters (bruschetta - yum!) as well as mains. \u00a0And the food was so great, and HUGE! I had the canneloni (delicious, and supremely cheesy!), my husband the calzone and our friend had the gnocci. All were amazing, and huge portions. \u00a0The total bill including a (fairly modest, to be honest) included service charge was under \u00a350, and that included a bottle of wine, too. \u00a0For great friendly service and good quality food you can't go wrong.",

My friend had a pizza and I picked the spaghetti carbonara. The portion sizes were quite large and the food tasted decent, though it was nothing special. Dessert was delicious though! So don't skip on that! Service was a bit slow and there was no dedicated server for specific tables, so things got confusing once in a while. While the staff were all quite friendly, this disorganised approach did bother me a bit. The tables are also placed so closely together that we were practically sitting on other people's laps, so don't expect huge comfort.It's still a nice restaurant and I'd probably return here next time I go to see Wicked!",

Not sure if it was the luck of the draw, or the fact we came at the same time as several holiday parties, but I found myself crammed like a sardine into a small table where I was constantly being bumped by the waiters as they served other tables.Speaking of waiters, our own special person was one of the most surly people I encountered during our trip. He did, however, recommend the Pappardelle con Nastrini di Pollo, or chicken ribbons with roasted peppers, courgette & fresh tomatoes. This dish was excellent, as was the calamari appetizer. Too bad my dining experience was hampered by the service and seating.",

We were greeted and seated right away, then one server comes to get our drink order. Promptly they bring it to us and then take our order. Food was nothing short of wonderful! We ordered the bruschetta and caprese salad as appetizers then we each ordered the gnocchi as our meals (both obsessed with it obviously!). And of course we had to try dessert...Strawberry cheesecake. However I think it was more of a pastry type than a cheesecake but regardless it was delicious!

We arrived 30 minutes prior to closing and they welcomed us with open arms, even at the late hour. We were seated immediately and welcomed with drinks. I don't like mushrooms but LOVE gnocchi and the sweet waiter said I could have whatever my heart desired because the menu is simply a suggestion or starting point for dishes. I ordered gnocchi without mushrooms and my niece got the tortellini. Both were at our table within 15 minutes and topped with fresh parm. The pasta was fresh and tender and had amazing flavor although a little under salted. It would've been great to have some bread to sop up the sauce but other than that, it was excellent. The portion was on the small side but so was the price. We ordered tiramisu and the dessert of the day (profiteroles) to take away and it was fabulous!",

Victoria theatre and knew we wanted to find somewhere close by to grab some dinner before the show. We settled on Il Posto because it was so close to the theatre. Upon walking in the door we were pleasantly greeted and wished away to a table near the back. Our waiter was so genuine and joked around with us before taking our orders. We ordered a shrimp dish and bruschetta as our starters. The next thing we knew they were out and we were loving them. The bruschetta was fresh and the shrimp was perfectly cooked with some serious but wonderful spice.We ordered our entrees, I got one of the specials, a mushroom ravioli. Others in the party ordered the cannelloni and a lasagna. My meal was extraordinary. Wonderful freshly made pasta with delicious cheese and mushrooms. If you are looking for a solid Italian meal for a decent price come to Il Posto. They are ready and waiting with a smile and delicious plate of pasta.",

They still served us, but throughout the meal, the pretentious attitude of the staff made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.The venue was nice looking, although quite small. The staff oftentimes had to squeeze through impossibly small gaps between tables and chairs. At the table next to us, a waiter moved a table while a family was sitting there, which I found quite unusual.The food was nothing to write home about. It was reasonably portioned, enough but not gluttonous. The flavors were what you would expect from pasta, nothing spectacular, nothing bad.
