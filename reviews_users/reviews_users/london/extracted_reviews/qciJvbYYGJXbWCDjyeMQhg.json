Maswell's is way overpriced for what you get, my salad looked like a bowl of weeds, and if you have food allergies good luck finding a waiter who speaks enough English here to understand you. If they mess up your order... and they will.... don't expect to be compensated just be happy there is food. You are better off cooking at home because the ribs taste like they came out of a microwave. This is not classical American cooking but a cheep imitation with extortionate prices. A far cry to the original theme of the restaurant which was once famous for it Burgers, which were once enjoyed by Dudley Moore and Peter Sellers.",

I've often enjoyed a drink or two at the bar with friends - it is a good meeting place because it is so central. I can recccomend the cocktails! Only once i've ventured downstairs to try the food.

The first thing we noticed was how busy it was but there was a good atmosphere, completely unpretentious and they were great with the kids, even providing something to keep them occupied. The food was great, receiving a thumbs up by all and came surprisingly quickly considering there was 7 of us and how packed the place was. Portions were large and the kids' pudding option was gorgeous. One wanted the chocolate brownie, the other fruit kebabs but they shared both as their portions were also generous and each came with vanilla ice-cream. Our waitress was really attentive without being annoying and actually seemed to enjoy serving us. Whether this was genuine or not, it worked and her positive attitude provided us with an equally positive experience especially as service seems to be a thing of the past. If I had to fault this venue in any way, I would have to say that it was a bit noisy. The music was also a bit fast and was repeated quite a few times. You can't expect quiet in such a busy place but a review of their music selection could up my rating to 5 stars.",

I had the burger which was nice but was drenched in sauce which took away the flavour of the meat itself.

The main luring point of Maxwells is their Monday night offer, which consists of half price main courses and cocktails, of which there was hardly any alcohol in. When my girlfriend and I arrived, the restaurant was rather busy but they seemed to have enough staff on hand to take care of everyone. We were seated under the stairs and left for over 20 minuets to chose what we wanted, even though we had signalled our waitress numerous times that we were ready to order and were on a tight schedule as we had a musical to attend too.When my ribs arrived (around 45 minuets after ordering) they were dry and chewy... but this was hidden under the piles of sauce that would of made a plastic fork seem like it was one of their ribs. We then received the bill and found that the ribs were only 1/3 off... very misleading!I would not recommend this lace unless you had money to spare and all the time in the world to wait for your drinks and food.",

Big Buffalo Wings to start, a big burger to fill you up, and a big ice-cream to leave you promising never to eat again. Maxwells have got it right; Standard American-style dishes, a nice atmosphere between all the wooden tables and noise, with an array of celebrities painted along the walls.This place is on two levels. Upstairs is half-bar, half-restaurant, and downstairs is more seating. Downstairs is where I like to be. Traditionally I go for a meal here on my birthday every year with friends. I'm not sure why we go here; in all honesty it's not the best restaurant ever and I have, at times, had pretty bad service here. But bad-service is fine by me, it allows me to not feel guilty about my poor tips. If you're going to go here; you MUST get the Buffalo Wings; as they are pure magic. The place is moderately expensive but you could do worse. The good thing about going to Maxwells is at least you'll be full. I'd imagine this place could be great on certain nights; whereas my friends always seem to leave slightly disappointed.",

Having been brought up in Hampstead, and spending many a happy evening in their (now sadly closed) Hampstead branch, Maxwell's in Covent Garden is the venue of choice when you care more about the people you are with than the venue you are taking them to. The menu is varied, with no real surprises. There is a good selection of alcohol, and they do lunchtime specials on Mondays, imaginatively called Monday Madness. The staff are always friendly, although getting prompt service is sometimes a bit of a mission when it's busy. Being an American themed restaurant, they fall short of the mark when compared to somewhere like Ed's Diner, but the burgers are good and tasty, and the chips are decent. Portion sizes don't disappoint, and it's a delight to see fresh-ish salad being served on the side. I've had several birthday parties there - and everyone always has a good time. It's reasonably priced and there is always something on the menu for everyone. Their selection of deserts is also great - and their banana split is excellent. There are better eateries in the Covent Garden area, but Maxwell's is always a crowd pleaser.",

They have a great cocktail happy hour, which extends to up to 50% off on food on Mondays (try the burger, it's one of the best in London), which is always a good way to get started. The decor gives off a very trendy feel, which resonates with the standard of clientele. Although there is no dress code, most people are very well dressed and there are no beer louts about. In reference to some of the negative comments; it's often referred to as an American Diner, however, it's not. It's a bar and grill. Ed's Diner is an American Diner. Others say that the cocktails are watered down, which I have experienced only during happy hour when I first started frequenting Maxwell's. The fact is that it is dependant on which bartender is making your drink. It also helps if you to get to know them, if you are a regular. There are a few let downs. Slow service at peak times, drinks can be quite expensive when you're outside of happy hour, overall quality and quantity of food isn't remarkable for what you are paying, waitresses harass you for drink orders when you sitting near the bar (then you have to tip them, and Americanism I'm not fond of). All in all, it's definitely worth a visit for you to see for yourself, some love it, some hate it. I'm there at least once a month because I always know what I'm getting. 3/5",

You check this place out online and you would think it's amazing because you see donut burgers, burgers with cheese poured all over it, and extremely exciting looking milkshakes. We showed up for my birthday and we get seated at a 6 person round table that has no room to move around. Everyone in our corner of the restaurant was uncomfortable with how tightly they packed us in there (even though the restaurant seemed to be pretty empty). We ordered drinks and appetizers and our waiter left. 2 minuets later before our drinks even came out, our waiter is pressuring us to order our main course. We convince him to give us a little more time to look over the menu. Everything took forever to come out and when the food finally came out it was disgusting. I'm not picky with food at all but I got the cheese bomb burger and the cheese was the only thing that made the burger edible. It tasted like the burger was cooked, refrigerated, and microwaved. The other people that got burgers at our table agreed. My sisters Mac and cheese was dry and tasteless. I'm upset I spent my birthday here and I wish I could have this night of my vacation back.",

Please avoid this place at all cost! \u00a0First they make you think it is a super busy restaurant... they put us on a waitlist telling us it was going to take an hour to get us a table, when it took less than 20min We order the vegetarian fajitas, Green Beans tasted like the ones from a frozen bag, onions, green bell peppers and mushrooms were very saggy.. the salsa is not fresh :( \u00a0Flour Tortillas tasted like plastic.Second dish was the Couscous Salad which it was tasteless - no balance at all...it felt like we were eating just plain cold pasta...Very disappointed. We wanted to try desserts and order the Oreo FreakShake the sandwich on the top was the only thing good, the milkshake was mixed with lumps of whipped cream.. giving it a weird taste... I couldn't finish it ... after half an hour my stomach started to hurt and I felt like I wanted to throw out :(",

    "text": "Me and a few friends went to Maxwells two weeks ago as a friend of ours and her boyfriend were visiting from Brussels. There was seven of us on a Friday night. Where to go for dinner? We were lucky to be able to get into Maxwells with just a little wait. About 15 minutes and we were seated and got menus. Since we had already gotten drinks from the bar while waiting the waiter did not have to get us any. He seemed a little disappointed when we ordered only food.The food was good, some had Mexican food while a friend of mine and me had a tranditional burger. At GBP 10.95 for a burger I was hoping for a good one. Luckily, it was and it certainly was enough to deal with my appetite.We had a few more drinks and when paying, we added a little tip (to cover the service charge - I think service charge is inappropriate for a small group but hey, instead of a tip ...).All in all, good food, not too long wait even on a Friday ...",

    "text": "I would not go here again. That's not to say my experience here was awful or that the food was bad, it's because Maxwells is tediously average restaurant. And what's the point in going to a tediously average restaurant when you're in London??In one of the greatest cities in the wold Maxwells has no place. Sure it boasts history and great burgers, but the reality is - move over there are plenty of bigger boys out there now to rival. For some reason this is where my friend decided to have her 25th Birthday meal with a group of around 8. Cocktails are half price most days till 8pm. They were watered down, bland and just not right. All came in tall glasses and were rubbish versions of their famous originals. The Pina Colada was just cream in a glass and others sicky sweet. I ate the tequila infused veg fajitas (at \u00a314.95 a little pricey) and the Mrs Prawn fajitas, (at \u00a316.95 very pricey for a non-mexican restaurant). Safe to say I couldn't tell if anything was infused. The sour cream and salsa came out in those horrible paper ramekins that get soggy quickly. It took a while for the food to come out (even with a group of 8 taking their time umming and ahhhing). I just can't think of anything positive about the resturant itself. Too Loud, too dark, too garish. The only reason I've given this 3 stars and not the 1 or 2 it deserves is Reese. Reese was our waiter who was stuck at work because we turned up. He served with amazing enthusiasm, cheeky sense of humor and efficiency and patience. That boy deserves a bonus because he is just what good service is all about!",

It looked like nachos and had all the stuff that usually goes in nachos but nuh uh. Not so much. Meat concoction was super sweet and odd tasting with the cheese? Same with the ribs and chicken. Toooooooo much BBQ sauce. Omg. Out of the meal I think I made myself like the ribs and were impressed they weren't fatty like American ribs usually are. I did feel a bit queasy after the meal though. My husband ordered the calamari appetizer (decent) and pulled pork sandwich (he got a bit nauseous all day afterwards). The Mac and cheese our friends ordered was reddish orange. How is that possible? Kraft Mac & Cheese has nothing on this crazy orange cheese color.",

    "text": "This rather large and pretty much \"only for tourists\" restaurants has a lot of stark pluses and minuses. Let me try to list them out.Plus 1. Awesome happy hour. Lasts all through sunday. You get any cocktail for \u00a33.95 during this period.Minus 1. The cocktails aren't that good. My first order was a \"long beach iced tea\". It was very weak and watery and not at all like what this drink should be. My second, a concoction of lemon and whisky, was more enjoyable though.Plus 2. There is a decent selection on the menu, with quite a few mexican alternatives for the vegetarians among us. Its a place which won't shut anybody out for a lack of choice.Minus 2. The food is grossly overpriced given its quality. Its not that i am averse to paying \u00a314 for a peri-peri chicken with fries ... but this place didn't deserve it.Plus 3. We were lucky to get a very understanding waiter. He was patient and understanding even though some people in our group hadn't arrived even an hour past the reservation time on a busy sunday evening. He also didn't crib when we handed him 6 cards at the end and asked him to split the bill equally.Minus 3. A big chunk of the waiting area is in the basement where you don't get a cell phone signal. Naturally your friends will be an hour late if they can't reach you. Finding someone in this huge restaurant can be quite difficult.Plus 4. Maxwells definitely makes the best cheese nachos i have ever had. I am sure that my experience of this dish hasn't been extensive ... but what i had here ranks at the very top, and by quite a margin. The crab cakes were very good too.Minus 4. But that cannot be said about all the food items. The steak i got was pretty small and the buffalo wings were rather ordinary.Maxwells is located within 30 metres of the Covent Garden market. This is a place which is perfectly suitable for tourists roaming around covent garden who don't mind paying \u00a327 per head for pretty average food ... they are here to spend money and help our economy anyway :) But if you know the city, there are significantly superior alternatives available within a very short walk.",

What I found note-worthy during 1 of my several visits was their commendable service for a particularly crowded place. I had asked for my steak medium and I was nearly through my meal when I noticed a splash of red not quite common for a medium steak. When I brought it to the attention of the staff, the manager came by to offer me a new meal. Considering I was nearly through, I wasn't very keen so he sent the two of us a very nice cocktail each, which was good enough to be dessert, really.

    "text": "Having never even heard of this place, I waltzed in here with a couple of friends so that they could eat prior to hitting a club (wusses! Don't they know they're just going to need more alcohol?!), and it did not disappoint.There were a few groups of people at the door waiting to be seated, on a Thursday night, around 9pm. Arguably quite a good sign!I can't comment on the food itself, as I didn't touch any of it personally, but I heard quite a few appreciative om nom noms from both my friends as they somehow ate portions that looked bigger than they themselves would be, should they curl up in a ball and 'allow' me to throw them in the oven.What I can comment on however, are the drinks. I worked myself through some 4 or so cocktail options, a few of them several times in a row, so I feel like I can make quite a sound judgement here. I loved them all! What helped even more was that our waiter actually *knew* their cocktails (one of the things that truly annoys me is when the server doesn't actually know anything of their cocktails, making it nigh impossible to pick something to your tastes when they don't have your usual picks), and was able to place recommendations to me based upon his own tastes and what he felt matched my description of what I wanted.Speaking of, waiters. Mmmm. It would appear they pick 'em good here! Or at least, a couple of them. Ladies be warned, or indeed, men be warned not to come here, as every single lady in the place was pretty much just checking out this one waiter here. Even to the extent that I overheard a small argument between a couple on whether she should just break up with her partner to marry said waiter.Of course, it was our table that made a phone number exchange with him.Of course.(I am the ultimate wingman)(You'd better call her, boyo! WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK!)The prices here can add up quite quickly, with dishes hitting up to the \u00a311 mark (didn't see higher, but as a non eater, didn't look too hard), and we actually managed to spend \u00a375 pre-tip, on a meal, two starters and a looooot of drinks. It helps however that between 10 and 11 is cocktail happy hour, whereby they all go from \u00a35.95/\u00a36.95 to \u00a33.95.If you're in the area and after a fix, be it food or drinks, I can recommend this place. The atmosphere was pretty laid back and comforting, as previously mentioned.Enjoy! ;)",

I always recommend the shared nacho platter. As it's good value for money. It's very big and you get plenty of nachos even for 3 people it's a good size with extra cheese! Moreover the dessert menu is my favourite! Their freakshakes and soda floats are what make this restaurant such a classic American diner. The setting here is a bit dim with the music sometimes being super loud. If you're not into clubbing but like some live evening entertainment with drinks then this is definitely tour place to go!",

    "text": "Unfortunately when you take a chance on a touristy restaurant it doesn't always pay off. Maxwell's promised a fun, American diner style atmosphere but did not deliver.We were the first ones in at lunch and it slowly filled up. Having placed our order, drinks and appetizer came out in a reasonable time. My Coke float was nostalgic and simple. The cod sticks were quite tiny, having a total of four. They tasted good thanks to dipping sauce.Then things got odd when our server asked who wanted their salad dressing on the side. Since my friend and I both ordered salads, we confirmed it was hers. Not long after, my Chicken Caesar salad arrived without mention of her Chopped Chicken salad. We assumed it would be a moment later. We waited five minutes while we flagged down the server. He said it would be out soon. After waiting even longer her salad arrived without any dressing. When we stopped another server to ask for it there was confusion and a conversation with our server to get her dressing. No apology for the wait or explanation.The server was strange throughout the meal and we didn't feel valued. Not to mention my salad was average. Probably not the best choice at a diner / bar but they had 4 salads on the menu.Needless to say I won't be returning nor would recommend this place to anyone who wants an American diner experience.",

    "text": "So we came here today on my birthday mainly because I really wanted to try their freakshakes. Anyway, we reserved a table and were seated straight away. Ordered ribs, chicken wings and shrimp for starters. The ribs and shrimp were ok but chicken wings were a little dry though not too bad.For main we had the BBQ chicken which was a little too BBQ sauced up but was ok. The burgers were great. The fries though were amazing. Really tasty and had right amount of crunch. Freakshakes. Oh boy, the Oreo milkshakes were a 5* on their own. Amazing. Milkshake soooo tasty. I finished the lot as did my 13 year old. Hubby had the unicorn freakshake. Looked pretty but got sweeter and sweeter with every mouthful.Overall not a bad place for a meal, will return especially for the freakshakes. Go Mondays for the Monday madness menu, discount prices....except the shakes",

We saw Maxwell's with the pretty Christmas tree outside and decided to give it a go. The freakshake was amazing - I had the oreo one with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. They match the price of the shake with the size of it too! Needless to say I couldn't finish it without falling into a food coma. I was really craving fish and chips which they didn't have - so I ordered the appetizer goujons and a side of chips to make my own. The service was great but I would say the food is just okay. The ambience is nice and the decor is beautiful!",

I went for the Mars one and although it was not a bad chocolate milkshake, I can't say that it was in any way close to the famous mars taste I was expecting. But, my friend who went for the Oreo one had better luck ! It was really delicious, and did taste like you would expect (and for the same price as mine, she had an ice-cream sandwich on top). The place was clean and the staff very friendly. A bit on the pricey side (8\u00a3) but it should be expected considering the cheer size of the shakes ! Also, I would recommend to go there on an almost empty stomach, they're not joking when they decided to call them \"Freak shakes\" !",

    "text": "Decent food!I appreciated that this restaurant was taking a stab at American food. The menu featured several different burger, fajita and comfort food options. We came here late on a Wednesday night after seeing a show. Their \"Theater Menu\" attracted us. We were impressed by their dessert menu as well. Their \"Freakshakes\" looked very interesting.My friends both ordered from the regular menu and the theater menu. My one friend ordered Mac n' Cheese bites, Steak Fajitas and a Mars Freakshake from the regular menu. The mac n' cheese bites were fairly good! They were covered in cornflakes and fried. They needed a little salt but other than that I was impressed. He said the Fajitas were pretty good as well. The Freakshake was delicious! The shake was very chocolatey and it was covered in Mars candies. You should definitely get one if you come here! My other friend ordered chicken wings, a burger and a salted caramel donut from the theater menu. The wings were very spicy but fairly decent. The burger was alright but the fries were really good! And the salted caramel donut was delicious! He literally licked the plate. All three courses only cost 14.95 pounds! That's a pretty good deal for that much food. I had an Oreo Cookie milkshake. It was pretty good, I've had better but I still drank the whole thing.I really thought this place would be super touristy but it was fairly decent. The prices can get high but it just depends on what you order. Great place if you're looking for food after seeing a show!",

The only reason it is getting three stars is due to the fact the Oreo freak shake was amazing. The doughnut burger that took the please of the jug of cheese burger is pretty blah in my opinion. It's not a doughnut that's cut in half and the meat is between the pieces it's a ball of dough wrapped around the entire beef patty. The patty was very bland and the bacon didn't appear to be fully cooked. My wife's burger (the New Yorker) was pretty bland as well. The fires were really good as well helping keep the rating at a three.",

Having finally actually visited last week I don't think that opinion has really changed! It all started well and we were given a great table near the door that was almost in its own area (very thoughtful given some of my lovely girl crew could probably use a bit of sound-proofing ;).But the service was really quite poor - slow, inattentive and bordering on rude. Our main server was friendly when we could finally get her attention (after having to wave at the front of house who stands rooted by the door but is unable to take orders so instead takes even longer hunting down your waitress). The guys that brought over our food need some customer service lessons though, barking at my friends to 'move it' and 'make room' when they were trying to put things down - sure we'll help but either smile and ask nicely or help rearrange it yourselves. We'd been lured in by the freakshakes after succumbing to the hype and I was left disappointed with the salted caramel one I shared with my friend. The shake part was quite bland and the rest was a wasteful amount of squirty cream topped with a dry-ish doughnut. The oreo one across the table looked slightly better but still not worth the money, nor the service experience we had. Will probably leave this one for the (non-yelping) tourists as suspected!",
