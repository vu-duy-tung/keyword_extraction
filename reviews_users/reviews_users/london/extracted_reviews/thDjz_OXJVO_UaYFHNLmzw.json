We went in an were greeted by a friendly host who took our coats and seated us. The menu here is quite extensive, but we finally made some solid choices. We started with the Antipasto Romano which came with traditional roman antipasti of salami, parma ham, artichoke, olives and fried pecorino cheese. Can't go wrong with this. For mains, we ordered a meat pasta and fried calamari, scallops, etc. I wasn't too impressed with the pasta (sorry, the name of it escapes me). Of course, the fried seafood mix was very good. Service was lacking here. They were very slow with bringing out water, bread, the food. Although Signor Sassi is a decent place for Italian, there are many more places I'd rather go to.",

I haven't been back since, but on a recent trip to London, I figured I should hit the joint for a meal for old time's sake. And I'm glad I did.The menu is extensive, and it's not cheap. But the setting and service are terrific, and the food was pretty darn good, so I'd say value for money received, at least from my POV.I had a cocktail, a shrimp dish, and a salad, along with a glass of wine.

And there was no sense of apology when they forgot to heed allergies or forgot to serve portions of the order. The food itself was hit and miss. Some was ok and some was good. Pasta pomodoro was good but fettuccini wasn't special. So I'd say this place is chaotic and not worth venturing into.",

And lobster risotto and pasta are both good,worthy to have a try.I really like the dessert in the blue plate, it tastes like a milk custard, like it!!!",

We ordered the ravioli also and no complaints there. The staff was attentive and our food came out really quick and it was super hot. I would definitely recommend going here!",

My friend and I mentioned to the hostess that we were hoping for dessert and wine \u00a0, then asking if we should sit at the bar or a table. She insisted we sit at a table. Upon seating, we asked for the dessert menu. The waiter walked away and said they would not help us without ordering dinner. If this was policy and we were told at the door it would have been acceptable. But the manner in which we were told we would not be served was offensive and ill mannered. While visiting London I have been treated quite wonderfully with all staff until I arrived here. As a result of their rude nature in asking us to leave, I can not recommend this place and will suggest my friends avoid moving forward.",
