First of all, location is great, right in the centre, and food is delicious.Really surprised how delicate and fine everything tasted and all of the groups enjoyed their dishes.Starters to share offered a great variety of tasty palate treats (strongly recommend the spicy meatballs), and mains were beautifully presented with meat, 3 mounts of dill rice, saffron rice and cinnamon rice, greens: all together a delicious large portion.The staff was knowldgeable and gave us advise on the different dishes so we could make our choice.Service was prompt.Oh and nearly forgot the mesmerising belly dancer, great skills + entertainementGreat experience.",

    "text": "My friends visiting London on a work trip from HK and I had been trekking around Covent Garden for a hour looking for some Spanish restaurant one of them vaguely recalled eating at and enjoying immensely - yes, us foodies can be quite dedicated like that. After peeking into several corner establishments, by-lanes and alleys, peering through numerous menus and an hour of walking around, with no success, we reluctantly gave up and decided to be a bit more open-minded.These said friends were in town only for a weekend and normally for such occasions I prefer planning in advance to showcase the best of London for such visitors. However, on a whim, we decided to duck into this spot with our fingers crossed that this wouldn't end on a sour note. The ground floor dining area seemed choc-a-bloc with people and we were wondering how long the wait for a table would be but we were soon whisked downstairs to a much quieter and more private area where we sat on low chairs amidst low lighting. Apparently this is a spot with occasional belly dance performances but we were glad that there were no shows on that night for we wanted some conversation over dinner. The menu seemed extensive and rather novel (the menu seems to have been trimmed since my last visit there?) - none of the names resonated with familiarity and the combination of flavours described (sweet dry fruits with spiced meat, etc), while reminiscent of some other cuisines, seemed to promise a good meal.Between the three of us, we decided to go for the Feast Sini for two with a variety of meats and prawns accompanied by salad and a variety of flavoured rice, along with a veggie main to mix it up a bit. I remember the portion sizes being quite hearty and the meal was very tasty. The lamb was really tender and the chicken was bursting with flavour.I am not sure whether my initial expectations were set really low or whether the meal was really that amazing. It could have also been that I was not footing the bill - a famous investment bank was being expensed for this rather lavish spread and I really did not mind ;) Either way, I have pleasant memories of this meal, but I am not sure if the magic will necessarily be repeated on my next visit therefore I desist from giving it a five star rating.",

    "text": "This is my absolute favourite restaurant in the UK, a gem discovered one evening when hunger could have led us anywhere. It's a fairly small restaurant inbetween Covent Garden and Leicester Square, gorgeous glass lanterns outside the restaurant which glow warmly to invite you in. Once inside, it gives a real homely feel with rich colours on the wall, dark wood tables and low lighting. Oh yes, and the wonderfully-hypnotic music that they play at just the right noise levels. A sturdy menu with something to please even the fussiest of eaters, I'm sure. We can't resist doing the whole four-course thing at times, as the starters, main courses and desserts are all too yummy to resist. For starters ... well, you have to try some of their home-cooked breads, heavenly. So try some dolmas and be adventurous with a few other dishes that may have escaped your attention before - you won't be disappointed. For a substantial main course, well you can choose just about any dish and be left sated. Gormeh sabzi is very much an acquired taste but absolutely gorgeous, if a little too rich. My personal favourite is the duck with pomegranate sauce. Desserts ... ahhhh, you have to try ALL of them! For drinks, they do a lovely range of freshly-squeezed juices which are not especially common. As well as a decent selection of wines, sparkly stuff and champagne (Perrier Jouet, I vaguely recall!) plus your average liquers. Oh yes, do try the proper coffee too ... an acquired taste but addictive! The staff are always unfailingly polite, happy to give their opinion or suggestions but careful to maintain a discreet distance until they are absolutely sure you have finished. Downstairs are the bathrooms and a low-level seating area, which is where they have the \"hubbly-bubbly pipe\" in the evenings - this is also where the kitchens (pristine clean) are to be found, and where the lovely belly-dancers arise from ... most often seen on Friday evenings 9pm 'tho I am sure they are there at other times of the week, too. Can't rate this restaurant highly enough - I'd have given it 20 stars if they were available.",

    "text": "Hi and welcome to my first post.I thought I knew what to expect from this restaurant, as soon as my mum said Persian, I thought middle Eastern, which I've had many times- this was something different and special. The staff were really friendly and hospitable and although we had booked a table for 8 on a Saturday night we were late by 30 minutes. Yet they still managed to seat and take orders within 10 minutes of waiting at the door to opening that menu (Was busy).What I really liked was the ambiance of the inside. It's not 'trying too hard', but really tries to project the old Iranian/Persian dynasty. The menu was not over complicated and the food came quickly.4 dishes- 2x Rice and Lamb (Lamb and herb is worth a try) and two duck dishes. Excellent food, tasty, different, great portions and will be going again!If you're hungry like we were, starters won't satisfy but they were really tasty; felafel/meatballs/bread/Chicken. The place all in all is great but quite small so booking is really advised. This is not like the cafes on Edgware road- hence earlier I said special... I was probably looking for the word 'Unique'.Great experience! Thanks! :) p.s be prepared for belly dancing.Please check out pictures!",

In fact, I never liked duck (and still don't) except for the Duck with Pomegranate - the sauce is so smooth, so rich!All the dishes come with three types of rice and a small green salad. There's really no need to order appetizers... I mean, unless you just want more delicious. The lavash, however, is not served warm and is always too small an amount for the quantity of dip and must be purchased separately. Their cocktail menu - while small - suits the food very nicely. Be sure to finish your meal with the Lazy Pumpkin, a cold desert comprised of pumpkin puree, cinnamon, coconut, and condensed milk, which is probably the best combination I can think of for a desert.Some nights they have a bellydancer, which is a bit awkward, but don't let her distract you from the flavors! Persian food is my favorite cuisine, and you won't be let down here. The owners are very concerned with the quality of their food and checked on us a number of times. For weekends, be sure to make a reservation as it's often full.",

We had the lamb and herbs stew, royalty grill and a vegetarian grill. Every dish had the same sides ('exotic' greens, same three different rice). The stew had definitely been prepared beforehand and just heated up prior to serving (and it was a small portion for the price). Unless you're desperate I would not recommend this place.",

She leaves 2 mins later \"we can't do take away\". Wtf 2018 who doesn't do take away. What do patrons do with leftovers. Pissed me off because I hadn't eaten all day and she tells me bs. What a way to treat tourists. So terrible. Btw I believe it was racially motivated. Because all the other patrons didn't seem to have issues and they were non black. Such nonsense.",

Chicken kabab is so delicious as is the ghormeh sabzi. The owners are usually here and very welcoming. I will miss this place and will be sure to come back next time.",

Yes, is a bit pricey and portions are slightly smaller than expected. But, you're getting the most flavorful, soft, moist, colorful Persian dish in all of London. Definitely worth it. The rice, which is a miss by many restaurants, was appropriately lengthened, soft, buttery and cooked. The meat was made to perfection. Definitely order the Sultani (both Koobideh and Barg) with 3 different rice options if it's your first time as it is the most classic dish to get all tastes in one, and don't forget a refreshing doogh (the house yogurt drink) and sabzi/raw onions on the side. And did I mention how wonderful and authentic the atmosphere is? Truly delightful to hear real Persian music as you dine. Highly, highly recommended!!",

I had Persian tea to warm me up after my walk from the hotel, ordered the cucumber/tomato/herb salad (not going to even attempt to spell it!!!) and the gormeh sabsi stew for dinner (not sure how well I did on that spelling!!). The food was just as lovely as the restaurant except, and maybe this is only done at my usual Persian restaurant, but they didn't give me any herbs/onions/cheese/radishes to nibble on with my food. I may be spoiled in that I grew up surrounded by Persians who taught me the wonderful cuisine from Iran (and the ugly side of it too... yogurt drink blegh!!) and so I'm used to having it a certain way, nonetheless, the stew was good and filled that craving I'd been carrying for a while!",

If I know anything about Persian food (mostly from having a friend from Iran), it's that they take real pride in the rice they make and I could truly see that in the meal.

The dressing in the salad was so delicious. It was yoghurt based with lemon. The three rices were light and fluffy and wonderful as well.
