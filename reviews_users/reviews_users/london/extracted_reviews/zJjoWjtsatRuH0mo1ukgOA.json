    "text": "Yum yum YUM!My favourite Sushi in London. Once you go Hiroba, you don't go back.It's more expensive than most places, but not by much, and the ambience and decor are flawless. I love the now-standard conveyor belt that runs the delicate sushi plates around the room and under your nose to make you drool and eat until you can't eat no more, as the song says! The food is always fresh and delicious. This is not Yo! (bear in mind, if you eat at Hiroba, you will never go back to Yo. Truly. Your tastebuds won't let you waste money like that... I tried...) I'd definitely recommend a visit to Hiroba. Delicious!! And if you're feeling adventurous, at the end of the meal try their banana sushi. Very odd, but very good!! Reviewed June 2010:Having been to several more sushi places, and then back to Hiroba, I am now of the opinion that they use much too much sauce / mayo in their rolls. Which makes me reluctant to go back, as it tends to drown the other flavours (not to mention have fat)...",

    "text": "Sushi Hiroba is a bit of a fusion mixture of Korean and Japanese flavours, apparently inspired (or at influenced) by westcoast stateside sushi places. They have both a sushi train and tables and if you go early enough, you don't have to worry too much about booking. The prices do add up after a while, but for the most part, the quality seems to be high and, in general, pretty worth it. If you're seeing some show in the area, it's a much better alternative to the Yo Sushi chains around but nowhere near the same quality as some of the more authentic Japanese places hidden on either side of Regent Street.",

However, my love of sushi really has turned into a love of Shushi Hiroba, as this really is the best place to get Sushi in London. A little pricey, but so worth it. Their Sashimi is without doubt the highest quality I have tasted, particularly the scallops and tuna, and their hand rolls expertly created. they have the usual train, and more intimate tables, and I have heard they are partial to a spot of karaoke on a few pre booked nights. Marvellous!",

We actually booked a room for Karaoke, and apparently the Karaoke & the Sushi place were under different Management. How were we supposed to know that? We didnt get a a Memo, nor was there a sign informing customers about it. The funny thing is it wasnt a big deal, first we wanted to order food downstairs for the karaoke room, they told us we have to order upstairs and bring it down. Some of us decided to just go upstairs and eat and some of us wanted to eat down. The manager got pissed about this?!! Was very rude in the way he talked to us. For some reason he was getting frustrated, i guess he shouldnt be in the service industry, if he cant deal with people or be flexible. But we went the classy way and explained to him that there was no need to be rude, and that we werent aware it was under different management. They are inflexible, even in terms of paying the bills. We wanted to pay our own bill, but they asked us that one of us should pay for all the drinks....???WTF? They are bunch of inefficient, rude bunch of people providing bad customer service.",

We've been for lunch and just propped ourselves up against the bar of rotating dishes and ideally picked whatever we fancied, just by what looks the best. And since as this applies to most of the dishes it is quite difficult to keep a tight reign on the budget. Most plates from the belt range from \u00a33-\u00a37 for 3-6 pieces whilst from the menu expect to pay anything up to \u00a310. I particularly like the salads for a change and they do a lovely Yellow Tail Tuna one that is drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.I really recommend Sushi Hiroba for lunch as the intimate interior makes for a really pleasant dining experience, more so than sushi bars such as Yo! and Itsu, whilst the slight twist with the fusion combination offers some interesting flavours.",

Okay not really at all except for the conveyor belt and plates priced by color. \u00a0Sushi Hiroba on the other hand has much more selection in sushi, sashimi, maki and even cooked food that you can order by waitress or if your lucky to see it, by pulling it off the conveyor as it passes you by.I tried their sushi, maki and a specialty roll and all were tasty, fresh and, something that always makes me happy good sized (the sushi and sashimi are really quite big which makes them even more of a value). \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of this by the plate idea since it can really rack up cost-wise easily but this place is PERFECT for people who want to bring a non-sushi eating friend to try a piece or two (viva variety) and for those who just want to sit down for some quality sushi at reasonable prices. \u00a0Just a note: this place can get quite busy for lunch so when you're done you will have to flag down your waitress to get your bill, not a trouble to me but if you're someone who wants attentive waiter service, then this might not be your spot at least during busy times.Certainly for me this will be my go to spot whenever I am in the area, so glad to finally be finding some better quality sushi in London!",

And each dish is of decent value as well.

Anything you don't find on the belt you can ask for, provided it's generally on the belt indicated with a little icon on the menu, and our server was really nice and helpful.I've definitely had better sushi before but the experience was priceless. You can even get beer and sake on the belt. The guys making the sushi are still at the bar just behind the belt and there's seating all the way around.There's so many place to eat in London I'm not sure I'd go back but if you're in the area it's definitely a fun place!!!",

    "text": "So I have just come home from having dinner here with my sister and her boyfriend. I was starving and I said and I quote \"I reckon I could eat \u00a350 tonight!\" In the end I ended up spending \u00a332 and I'm still hungry (including a green tea and coke).We picked here as we were meeting in Holborn and my sister fancied sushi, I did too once she planted the idea. I found Sushi Hiroba, looked at the website, read a few reviews on here and thought why not. Wish I had read more reviews now, top one I didn't realised was from 2009! My own fault.Where to start, why 2 stars? We arrived at 9ish. It wasn't busy but it took 10 minutes to be seated at the conveyor belt. We had to ask for wasabi and to order drinks, which took ages to arrive. There weren't many options on the belt. All the hot dishes were stone cold. We ordered hand rolls which were quite good, these arrived before our drinks did. The service in here is abysmal. The same dishes kept coming around. Yes we could order off the menu, but the reason for coming to a conveyor belt is to help yourself and stuff your face. My sister's boyfriend wasn't keen on the look of the sushi so ordered a rice dish, which in hide sight I should have done as his bill was half of mine and he was full after.The only redeeming point was the spicy salmon roll, it was delicious. I also had another one called dynamite, which was pretty good too, but the crispy bits had been out too long and were a bit chewy.Lesson learned, should have gone to Kulu Kulu!",

We sat at a table not at the carousel and indulged on a variety of sushi and sashimi, all of which was fresh without any fishy smell to it. I especially like their warm plates which are a brilliant idea for when you want to have sushi and can't eat a whole chicken and rice meal. These guys have you totally covered with their little plates of menu items which ordinarily come as a rice and meat dish but instead are served on a little sushi plate at a fraction of the cost. Brilliant!Sadly I haven't been back here since as it's not really close to anywhere I need to be on a regular basis but next time I'm in Holborn or perhaps visiting the National Gallery, I'll see if it's possible to stop by for lunch.Also, 10% discount for students.

    "text": "When a friend suggested this place for a weeknight dinner, I reluctantly agreed and had very low expectations because the website makes it sound like Yo! Sushi, which is fine for takeout or at the airport but not how I'd choose to spend \u00a330 and a social evening. However, the comfortable but stylish decor and surprisingly good sushi won me over. It's probably realistically more of a 3.5 star place, but they get a bump because they had uni, which is hard to find in London (albeit insanely expensive uni - \u00a35 for one piece! I'd never pay that in DC or NYC, but in London, Soviet rules apply to sea urchin). The menu is pretty Westernized, but they have more of the weird things that I like than the average London sushi joint. \u00a0We ordered a lot of sushi and small dishes for our group of four - all a la carte as we didn't sit by the conveyor belt (because who knows how long those little plates have been scooting around the loop?). I mostly went for sashimi - amaebi (sweet prawn) and surf clam, plus my overpriced but delicious (OK, not the best I've ever had - it would pass muster in NYC but probably not Tokyo) uni. The sashimi I ordered all had very generous portions - nice big pieces. I also had soba noodle soup and seaweed salad, both of which were good. My husband's toro looked nice. One friend got the big chicken curry, which was in fact big. They have a reasonably-priced wine list - we went for an unoaked Aussie chardonnay called Woolloomooloo, partly because the name was fun to say (it's named after an area in Sydney if memory serves). The prices here are reasonable - perhaps they cater to students, as it's not far from LSE and some other universities - although a lot of the people there were in suits. For the four of us, the bill came to just over \u00a3120 including a bottle of wine and a few beers, and we were all quite full.I'd probably come back here for a low-key dinner with friends - nothing on the menu is groundbreaking or earth-shattering, but it's fresh, reasonably well-made and reasonably priced with pretty nice decor and friendly staff.",

They are very quick, but mostly because it's one of those sushi bar restaurants where the food is put out on sushi boats and you can grab plates of food for varying prices. We weren't near the sushi boats, so we ordered off the menu. We ordered:12 piece sashimi2 piece Tamago nigiri6 piece tempura vegetables3 piece tempura soft shell crabSpicy tuna rollSo the service is pretty good, we could get the attention of the servers quite easily even though we were tucked into a corner. Food-wise, the sashimi was probably one of the best things. The salmon was great and the scallops were delicious. The tuna and hamachi were okay. The Tamago was nice. The tempura vegetables were a bit undercooked. The soft shell crab was also tasty. The spicy tuna roll was kind of disappointing. It's almost as if the rolls are made up really far in advance (even the ones you order), as the rice was just a bit wrong.So if I need a quick dinner and I'm in the area, I might come back. But we'd probably just order a lot of scallop sashimi and soft shell crab. With the amount of good sushi restaurants in London, it's hard to justify coming back.",

However, the service quickly changed this impression when they did not provide us with a menu and we constantly had to fight for the staff's attention.I ordered the spicy chicken ramen, since I love spicy and ramen soup (what could go wrong?). To my dismay, the soup had no flavour and tasted just spicy. The vegetables and chicken didn't seem too fresh either. In my frustration I ordered the spicy tuna roll. The roles were oversized (in a bad way - impossible to eat) and had (the same?) unpleasant taste. The overall quality of the ingredients (rice, cucumbers) were not impressive.

I've sat in before and service was quick, even when my friends were randomly ordering bits and pieces. The 10% off student discount doesn't hurt either. You wouldn't think it would be so good from the outside, but give it a chance. There is a sushi carousel and mostly bar seating there, which I try to avoid because I know I will spend way too much if it rolls by me. Unlike some of the other reviews from a while ago, I love it here. I am from New York and not having relatively inexpensive sushi at my beck and call is difficult. I quite like this place. It has tobiko sushi on the menu, which isn't everywhere. Now if only they opened up nearer to me. Also note, it's open until 10:30 on Sundays, when almost nothing else is. This past Sunday I went in at 9pm and it was packed. I also like when I see a majority of Asian diners in a sushi restaurant because, as my Japanese best friend back in NYC told me, it's a good sign that you will like it.",

Well, overall, it's definitely a good place to get a bite, since the food is pretty delicious. But something seems to be off-putting... the service was passable at best, maybe? Of the awful lighting? The fact that I've had way better sushis before?Whatever it may be, this is an average Japanese restaurant. Nothing out of the ordinary.",

The sushi seemed fresh enough and the vegetarian udon soup I ordered hit the spot for a frigid London night.
