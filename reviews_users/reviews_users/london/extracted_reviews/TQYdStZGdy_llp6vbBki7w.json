Fantastic terrasses and views of the City, nice wines/oysters etc...Few bemols needs to be mentioned, quality of the food has decreased alot over the last few years. They used to make fantastic snaks in the bar area Charcuterie/Fromages and other plates of quality products, but their list is now more like burger/french fries - I recomand salmon calamaries and oysters which are always great there though.Regarding the restaurant, the same apply, quality has decreased and few dishes are just a bit of an insult to the clientele (they replaced duo de foie gras by terrine de fois which is now basically soem pat\u00e9 with pies and carrots!!!).Wine list is still great.Service is less good than it used to be, more approximative and clearly less proffessional.So I would say more of a place to have a drink rather than having dinner. I usually go to the Bond's for the dinner, which is just around the corner...",

When we arrived we decided to sit on the roof terrace which has spectacular views of the London City Skyline. We were asked for a bank card when we ordered the drinks even though we were a party of six having dinner inside, which spoiled the atmosphere a bit. When entering the somewhat underwhelming restaurant, we discovered that we had been placed right at the back of the restaurant on a long table even though the restaurant was relatively empty. We asked to be moved to a more central round table and this was done although not very promptly. The menu had a good selection of tempting dishes. I began with the rock oyster followed by the steak with foi gras. I do have to say that for the prices you are paying the other starters were more the size of an amuse bouche rather than what you would expect. The mains were good although mine and my brothers had to be sent back as they were cold. Also my fathers food was delivered 15 minutes later than everyone elses which was confusing as he ordered a tuna steak which takes less time to cook and the restaurant had only three other tables dining. All in all it was rather disappointing, however, it was the service that let it down rather than the quality of the food. The views are fantastic though.",

Not only waiters were slow to serve or notice that you were asking for they attention, but they weren't even very polite and kind. Prices are actually not bad for such a place and that explains why the dining room is so crowded. Taking off a few tables wouldn't really hurt the profit, and would make the atmosphere a lot nicer. However, if you still want to cater for so many people, please add some toilets! I never had to queue to use the toilet in a restaurant before and also not in a dirty ladies.

I must admit I was not expecting such gorgeous food in this restaurant - their desserts are ah-maz-ing.The restaurant had smooth, elegant service and the food was served beautifully. I would have to say my memory can still taste the dessert - their Bitter Chocolate Fondant (au rhum caramel) is absolute perfection. They offer set menus, which are actually quite reasonable for London - \u00a329 for 3 courses (don't skip the dessert - seriously!). \u00a0The food is very rich - you will love it if you have a taste for French cuisine, and it will not break the bank for regular visits.",

    "text": "Coq d'Argent's name makes reference to its City location atop post-modern No.1 Poultry. You have to ride an elevator up, which is a bit hard to spot as it's somewhat tucked away from the street. Once you reach the rooftop, however, let the key selling point embrace you: the truly breathtaking and spectacular view of the City and beyond. I came here with a friend recently for Sunday lunch, and for \u00a328 per person, the 3-course prix fixe menu is exceptionally good value for City dining. I enjoyed the salmon rillettes, the glazed pork cheeks, and the cheese plate (\u00a34 supplement). Coq d'Argent has been around for quite a while (I first came here in 2002), and it remains a favored place for a power lunch or business dinner in the City. The outdoor terrace is a popular spot for evening drinks. On this Sunday, we were the first people there, and at that time the place was mostly empty. With a jazz band playing in the background; courteous, unobtrusive service; and the gorgeous view pretty much to ourselves, it was a perfect way to ease into a weekend day.",

    "text": "You know when people complain about expensive restaurants being more hype then substance and not worth the money? Well this place would back their claim.It was on a gorgeous sunny afternoon that we checked out this City establishment. Famous for having a rooftop garden with incredible views of London, that did indeed not disappoint. But that was the only thing that lived up to the reputation. The rest was about as lack luster as it gets. Starting with the reception upstairs where the hostess was unhelpful and not answering the question asked of her, directed us to another hostess. Clearly greeting people is a hard job. Having arrived early we did enjoy drinks of the rooftop garden which was splendid, before entering a very noisy dining room. Very noisy. I don't know how City business can possibly be conducted over a power lunch here as I could barely hear the person sitting next to me. The space itself was comfortable and modern but because of the noise one really doesn't feel comfortable. The food was less then spectacular, and at these prices it should be. It wasn't even good. Our starters were OK, but not exciting. Our mains were a serious disappointment. I had the Beef Wellington which the waitress herself said the chef recommended medium rare -which was what i wanted. It arrived well done. When it was pointed out to another waiter he just looked at me, clueless. Maybe it was only his job to ask how the meal was but not do anything about it or even comment on it for that matter. The meal was so disappointing we didn't even want dessert. Its been a while since I had a restaurant experience I considered a total waste of time, so I would suggest that others not waste their time their either.",

The view here is solid (by London standards, not by NYC standards) but given the local weather, your days are limited to really soak in the ambiance and sun here. Luckily for me I endured 5 days of sunshine during my trip to London last summer.

This all translated into a great experience, as the place wasn't too crowded (which it probably would be on a typical Friday night).The bars along the outside of the restaurant only offer a fraction of what can be made at the main bar - so I would recommend going to the main bar for drinks and then making your way out to the open air gardens. The grass in the garden is a nice touch, and made the surrounding concrete that much more friendly - and the mast that extends upwards does give the whole garden have a ship/submarine feel to it.Nice people, good cocktails, manageable noise levels, breathtaking scenery as the sun set upon London. Not much more you can ask for on a Friday night.This is definitely a place that you will want to go to, but that being said a lot of people probably go to it. When you can find that end-of-summer night where it's not packed, you've struck gold.",

Really, really lovely, very relaxing and friendly, great buzzy atmosphere. Spacious tables, no banging elbows. The three courses set menu for \u00a329 was very good value - for sublime masterchef food - had a lot of choices, which also included the dish of the day. We all had a different dish, and it was all delicious, all really nicely presented. I had the 63 degree free range British egg, smoked haddock and spinach for the starter, and it was perfection, followed by the almond and cacao nib venison, parsnip puree and amaretto sauce, which was also very tasty. All rounded off with some sublime desserts which included a Christmassy Yule Log. The wines were affordable, we chose the Chenin Blanc at \u00a326 to accompany our meal. They even had gluten free bread when requested. Service was friendly, welcoming and unobtrusive, We had a table near the window, so saw some beautiful views. Would definitely recommend and need to go back when the weather is warmer to dine alfresco on the rooftop terrace. Great place for a special occasion.",

    "text": "London continues to amaze me with how many cool places exist that you can walk by without ever knowing. Le Coq D'Argent is definitely a cool place and given that it's a stone's throw (no hyperbole, you can literally peg someone with a stone from my building) away I really am remiss in not visiting it sooner. My excuse is that the entrance is a bit hidden away and you have to ascend via the lifts before you are in the restaurant/bar proper.The key selling point of course is the massive outdoor terrace and bar. This comes in three parts. First, there is the bar next to the restaurant that services the typical upscale bar food. Benefit of this area is that you can get food (always a plus) and also the full range of cocktails from the restaurant bar. The burger comes highly recommended by my colleague and I personally would vouch for the Old Fashioned which was fantastic. It takes 7 minutes to make (most of that time is stirring) and it's good to see that some bartenders still take the time to make the drink properly. Tables can be a bit hard to snag and it seems that you must be sitting down in this area (not that there is much place to stand regardless).Next up, the outside bar and seating. This is immediately behind you when you exit the lifts and is a circle around the atrium like fixture. The bar is on the far side of the circle next to the entrance to the Terrace and unfortunately only serves beer, wine, and champagne. For cocktails you have to go to the inside bar although I think there is waiter service here so perhaps you can just place an order. It's a nice place to sit although it seems to be full of smokers so keep that in mind.Finally, the Terrace. This is the key selling point and on that rare sunny English day, it's full of well dressed City Boys and Girls having a cheeky glass of wine or champers. You have a pretty good view of the city (albeit currently marred by the construction site next door) and you do feel free and almost on top of the world. No seating here unless you want to plonk down on the grass but it's a great place away from the bustle of the streets to enjoy the sunshine. And you are high enough that the pollution seems a hazy dream. Fresh London air...crazy talk!I'm visiting next to try the food so will report more then, but give Le Coq D'Argent a try, it's well worth it once you manage to ignore the high prices. Cocktails run around \u00a310-12, champers about \u00a39/glass, and wine around \u00a330+ for a bottle.",

The only difference was that the prices had been marked up by about 8 pounds per person.Despite this, I still feel it was a good deal for three very well executed courses that tasted as good as they looked. I had the goats cheese and black olive tart, the black truffle risotto and the green apple parfait. Each one was delicious and the green apple parfait is coated in green coloured white chocolate and designed to actually look like an apple on a plate.

    "text": "I came here months ago with a friend who was a regular of Coq d'Argent and was always raving about the place so I was looking forward to giving it a try myself.We came for lunch and decided to do the three course set menu which was \u00a332pp.For entree I chose the fromage de ch\u00e8vre while my friend opted for the escargot. For mains we both chose the souris d'agneau - aka lamb shank with potato pur\u00e9e. And for desert we both chose the tarte au chocolat souffl\u00e9.My entree was my least favourite out of the three. The lamb shank was cooked perfectly and the pur\u00e9e was velvety smooth. The dessert was delicious. But I admit I am a sucker for chocolate souffl\u00e9s!Service was excellent and efficient. We also caught a glimpse of a few members of TOWIE (for those of you who watch ITV) sitting at a table nearby.Great upmarket spot for lunch, would highly recommend.",

Perhaps all kinds of topics on interest rates, inflation indicators and other money speak is happening on a rooftop, which has it's own notoriety. The lifts which will take you up to a nice escape from the mess around Bank station. I overheard the lead of the wait staff on this day, speak about the prioritising the customer experience. Clearly, they are trying their best to help us forget the machinations of the world economy. I like the restaurant's layout and decor, it is tastefully done. A classical French meal a very nice wine selection indeed. The service is was very good to us. For example, our first bottle had gone bad, and they made it a very low fuss situation. It allowed us to have a great lunch, and we probably did have a bit too much wine, but heck when you're on it, you're on it.I would come back for business meals and drinks on the rooftop again.",

Overall a lovely experience and would go again. Only complaint was the artichoke mousse thing was a underwhelming, perhaps it was a bit too subtle. Can't really remember what else we ate as it was a long time ago and i've got baby brain. sorry.",

Too cold to sit outside though the smokers were braving it under the heaters, and they provide blankets too! Our set price lunch on the Evening Standard deal - an annual promotion worth looking out for - was very good value though trying to find a bottle of wine under \u00a330 was hard. We ate in the Grill which is less formal than the restaurant and right by the bar. Tables next to the window look out on the terrace and the service was good. The set menu food was tasty and, as importantly, affordable and included an aperitif. In the summer the terrace looks like a great place to meet for drinks - if you earn a City salary...",

We had the set 3 course menu for two people - including champagne, drinks, service etc, bill was under \u00a3100. For the evening that we had, this is amazing.The food that we had all looked and tasted fantastic. In particular, the jerusalem artichoke veloute was a standout dish.This was simply the best meal I've eaten out this year, bravo!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for dinner on Friday night in the winter, despite the restaurant's popularity for its roof terrace in the summer. No one was outside, but you could see the nice foliage and the outdoor tables, and inside it was very busy and lively. They have an amazing raw seafood selection on ice right behind the reception when you arrive. It took an unusually long time for the two people there to process the coats of the 5 of us who had just come up the lift, but shortly thereafter we were seated at a nice table right near the entrance.We ordered from the set menu, which is 28 pounds for 2 courses and 32 pounds for 3. I thought that was surprisingly affordable. I ordered the escargots and slow cooked lamb shank, and my dining companions got the jerusalem artichoke veloute and the sea bass, and the black truffle risotto and the apple parfait. I really enjoyed my escargots and my friend said the veloute was solid, but the real standouts were mains, the lamb shank and the black truffle risotto. They were such large portions and the lamb shank was completely falling off the bone, and the black truffle risotto was to die for. The sea bass was recommended by the server, but that paled in comparison to our two other choices. And to finish it off, the apple parfait was simply stunning. It looks like a granny smith apple, but that's really white chocolate colored green and there is a sour apple cream inside. It was such a novelty! I thought the restaurant was exceptionally good value and I would definitely recommend it for an affordable nice dinner. We didn't get to enjoy a view or the garden area, but that's just another reason to return in the summer!",

I came for an quick early breakfast and was surprised to find it very quiet compared to other local establishment at the same time. Service was very friendly on arrival and my waitress was fun and bubbly, even with it being very early.I ended up getting the scrambled egg with smoked salmon and brioche. Salmon was great quality and eggs were perfectly cooked, slightly runny but very creamy. The brioche was average and I seemed to get the end, likely because I was one of the first in the restaurant. I would recommend and will be coming back to try the other menus. (Visit - 22/10/2015 Breakfast)",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night, busy time but a good mix of people, from regulars to business diners to groups of friends. Busy, but not overwhelmingly so - the bar wasn't overcrowded at all. I can see that changing when the outdoor terrace is a bit less cold. The elevators are inside the building - good signs, but you kind of have to know where you are going.They have multiple set menus as well as the a la carte version, kind of a cool idea I think - makes the choices easier, and all/most of the items just come off the main menus anyway. We ended up choosing a set menu, and it was an excellent choice.Service is excellent. Attentive but not overbearing staff, great communication about kitchen timing, etc. The sommelier was a bit pushy at the beginning of the meal, but very nice and I think just wanted to make sure that we had choice.Food was well done, rich, and full of flavor. We lapped up every bite. Portions were on the small side, but perfect - because the food was so rich. We tried a rabbit dish, and a lamb shank. The lamb was fall off the bone, and both meat dishes were cooked to the right temperature.I'm sure we could pick at something, but overall the experience was great. Note that it is expensive, so not great value. But - knowing that is was going to be overpriced going in helps - so not docking for that. Enjoyable evening for sure.",
