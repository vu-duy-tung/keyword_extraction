My first time at Hush, I was impressed with the location (down nookish Lancaster Court), the atmosphere (classy but relaxed) and the especially fabulous drinks. Hush has a competent bar staff and a brilliant molecular drinks menu. Among Hush's unusual mixes, their foam mojito is a sensational treat, as is their pi\u00f1a caviada (featuring tiny pearls of rum). Apparently, the sugar content of rum makes it the best booze for molecular cocktails. Fine by me \u00a0especially when it's super premium rum. And if you still think a cocktail ain't a cocktail unless served as a liquid, well, you'll be happy to know Hush still makes 'em a stiff one the old school way too.",

The menu is extensive but well thought out, with many different tastes catered for. I opted for the Honey Gin followed by the Black Forest Gateau martini. Both were interesting in their own way, although the former came with far too much ice which weakened the already delicate flavour. Overall, I couldn't really fault it, but would like to try a few more of the bars nearby before I consider returning.",

    "text": "I love this place. It's definitely a place to visit in the summer. It's on a tiny cobbled street just off Bond Street \u00a0the street is so tiny I only became aware of its existence summer 2007. It's this surreal little village looking street with beautiful cafes, restaurants and bars. It's like a little hidden secret and I'm so gutted I didn't know about this little spot before. You enter this court yard like area between a gap between two shops on Bond Street and as you continue to walk you discover all these little surprises. La Cave (French pronunciation) isn't actually a bar, but a 'wine boutique,' with two or three small round tables outside which allow for a seating area. Although the seating area is small and the cobbled street is somewhat narrow, in the evenings after work this place becomes completely filled with suited bodies, standing, sitting and lulling around drinking. A very friendly man served our drinks, he also worked in the boutique's sister restaurant which is also located in the little courtyard literally opposite La Cave. This place was introduced to my partner by a friend and he decided to take me and my friends. It was so unplanned, one minute I was shopping and the next minute I knew I was hazy on champagne. We spent the whole afternoon and evening there and managed to drink five bottles of Bollinger and a sixteen pound bottle of wine. This place may be selling it's alcohol at off licence prices, however this is no Threshers \u00a0the wine is pricy and high quality.Drinking in the sun during the day is not always the best concoction and by the end of the evening there was definitely some slurring and drink spillages, nevertheless this impromptu visit was more than a treat and we all had a great time.This place is 'Sex and the City' eat your heart out and I love it \u00a0One thing girls, be careful wearing heels on this downhill cobbled slope of a street. My partner was not impressed when I kicked my six inch heels off and shimmied down the stones barefoot!",

It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and because the bar is upstairs, you can enjoy a romantic dinner without interruptions. There is a lovely ambience with candles lighting each table and a great selection of food at approximately \u00a335 per person. You can get food in the dark and moody bar, surrounded by a hip business clientele. The only thing is, you have to look the part at this bar, as they have no troubles putting the pressure on those not suitably attired to hurry up and get out, no matter the amount they are spending on food or drinks. Hmm, image is everything they say!",

After 10 minutes I approached the bar I must have waited 15 minutes for our drinks as our glasses ran dry the same experience repeated itself, waitresses walked by looking at empty glasses. The interaction that we did have was abrupt and unfriendly. We heard staff talk to other customers and it was the sameall very arrogant. The decor etc is a little dated now and menu over priced I geek this place needs to smarten up and improve it's service and move with the times or it won't compete at all.

The burger is great and the truffle fries are so good you want to lick the dish when they're gone. The outdoor dining space is wonderful and they have heaters for cooler days. The area is completely covered with tents however you'll still enjoy that open air feeling. I've found the staff to be good and hospitable. I took a colleague there for lunch and had an amazing bowl of the pea soup with rarebit. I had no idea pea soup could be so good. They have a lovely selection of wines as well as a full bar. The inside dining space is nice however the carpets are looking just a bit tattered. The upstairs lounge areas are nice and there's space for a private dining experience as well. I wasn't very impressed by their bathroom... it didn't feel or smell clean. (Note: To some this is no big deal, after all it's a public toilet but I'm picky about where I pee... there I said it.) Anyway, you'll truly enjoy this place however it's a bit hidden so give yourself a little extra time when you plan to dine there. I've been three times and already have another reservation so clearly the mention above isn't a deterrence. Hush is a fantastic little escape with a delicious dining experience that you might just want to keep to yourself. Perhaps it's why they call it Hush? Over all this American Southerner in London gives them two thumbs up and says give 'em try, y'all.",

The decent selection of sandwiches and scones are ample to snack on while drinking the Hendrick's Gin-based cocktails. There are a couple of moleculars, a couple of infused martinis and a hot tea infusion for the brave. Try the Hendrick's Spring from the infused section, Hendrick's Gin infused with Lavender and Cucumber, garnished with a Lavender Flower. Once you've worked your way through the short but effective menu bring yourself round with a sugar-shot from a Bougie mini macaron and prepare for some frivolous shopping.

The menu shows a few hints of creativity (the bang bang chicken is great) but the prices are somewhat extreme. There are often various offers advertised (\u00a325 set menus, 50% off food, etc) so have a look around if you're planning to go, and book the offer. However even with the 50% offer, dinner for two managed to hit \u00a380, with a \u00a325 bottle of wine and a rather shocking 20% service charge. For \u00a380 I would say that the dinner was worth it - at a stretch (ignoring the 40 minutes it took for our starter to arrive, or the sniffy response to a request for a pitcher of tap water). The bar upstairs is very cosy and it was easy enough to get a table there at 10 on a Saturday night - not bad for a decent west end bar. Good drinks menu, although expect to pay \u00a310 / drink. Would I return? Maybe for an 'occasion' - but only if I could get the offer. I'm mortified that our meal would normally have cost \u00a3130, considering what we got for our money.",

The food is quite good, provided that one orders carefully. The burgers and steaks are only so-so, but the avocado Dorset crab was great. I had some simple grilled salmon, cooked perfectly pink, which went well with the side dishes. The champagne aperitif was also lovely and generous. The bar upstairs is quite elegant and lively and definitely caters well to the mature 40+ crowd.

I would be positive and say this is a sign they're in no rush to hustle you out the door.Food was excellent - I recommend the carmelized onion tart as a starter. It's like a sweeter, solidified french onion soup in a small pie with a very flaky crust. For dessert, the White Chocolate and Earl Grey Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was fantastic.",

The silver room and the cocktail bar are upstairs and are a mix of intimate dining area's, a really nice bar and a larger more main stream area capable of seating larger groups. I have eaten here many times and it is one of my favourite places to go for a quiet and relaxing meal either for two or with a group of friends. Service is always good and the menu which changes form time to time is always top notch. Slightly formal but you need that for it to fell special, this would be a good place to celebrate something special, to entertain business lunches or dare I say it - for that intimate evening with a loved one. Definitely worth a visit, I think you will enjoy.",

    "text": "Very stylish cocktail bar/restaurant in Mayfair. I love the surroundings and although it's quite famous, I didn't know this place until a couple of months ago, when I found it by chance while wandering around New Bond Street. The courtyard is really lovely, I wish I could bear the English weather and have lunch/dinner there sometime, but less than 20\u00ba is not acceptable for my Spanish background. Still, I kept Hush in my mind and when I saw a deal to try their new Hendricks High Tea menu at half the price, I bought it instantly. Afternoon tea is served in the cocktail lounge on the first floor, and the Hendrick's option includes a choice of a Hendrick's Gin Cocktail, a sample of a Hendrick's Gin Molecular cocktail and finger sandwiches, scones and mini macarons. Staff are very kind and pleasant and presentation is impeccable. They have those cute Hendrick's teapot and cups, for example. Now, the food. Sandwiches were really good, specially the chicken and avocado on on Poil\u00e2ne Bread. The warm scones were good as well, and I really liked the trio of jams (Wendy Brandon's Rose Petal Jelly was really special although maybe too sweet, Gooseberry and Elderflower was my favourite). Macarons weren't as good as the rest of the menu, though. The only thing I didn't like were the cocktails. We had the Hush Wolfsberry (Hendrick's Gin infused with Rose Petals and Goji Berries, Goji Liqueur, Edible flower) and as sample something with peach puree and Earl Grey Tea foam, I believe. It's not that they weren't good, I guess it's because I'm not a big fan of alcoholic drinks and those cocktails were the strongest I've ever had! I suppose it's similar taking an average Starbucks-caramel vanilla extra sugar and whipped cream frappuccino coffee drinker to Spain/Portugal and offer him a \"caf\u00e9 solo\". Even if it's good, they wouldn't like it. I could barely finish the sample one, so my boyfriend had 2 Hush Wolfsberry and 1 sample molecular one. He said it was the best afternoon tea he has ever had :)",

It is certainly a place littered with posh city types, but that didn't bother me as the cocktails were mightily fine. I had one with sake and a floating pansy it in and it was divine. I took part in the cocktail masterclass and discovered my love for the classic gin fizz. The mixologist was rather patient with me as I was a bit rubbish with my cocktail shaking technique. The venue is stunning and as it's just off the main drag of Oxford Street, it doesn't feel like you are in central London. Its beautiful courtyard gives it a distinctly mediterranean feel. I will be returning with bells on! :o)",

    "text": "Hush is definitely a special place. I will give it 4 stars but that's not for the main restaurant and only for the following:- a great location in a small pedestrian mews in the heart of Mayfair, with a nice terrasse- a very lively bar upstairs at night - a perfect place for alfresco dining or lunching at their terrasse on this pretty little piazza- a good place for a business lunch or dinner at the quieter and more grown-up upstairs restaurant called The Silver Room. That room is elegantly decorated with comfortable seating and professional service. They serve a mix of French and Italian food. I had an excellent buratta to start followed by a milanese veal perfectly cooked and a very very good coffee (worth stressing as this is rare in London) The restaurant on the ground floor is not so great in my view although it is clearly very popular, and noisy! Too noisy for me, plus the chairs are not so comfortable and the tables very close to each others. The menu is ok but nothing to write home about. So remember, go there for drinks, outdoor dining/lunching or for serious lunch/dinner at the Silver Room. PS: I am amending this review slightly as I come back from an evening in the private room above the restaurant (on the second floor), definitely a great room to rent for an event with friends or for business (with dedicated bar and lkounge area).",

Try the Hendrick's Spring from the infused section, Hendrick's Gin infused with Lavender and Cucumber, garnished with a Lavender Flower.Once you've worked your way through the short but effective menu bring yourself round with a sugar-shot from a Bougie mini macaron and prepare for some frivolous shopping.

Well worth trying but I think my arteries will be grateful if I never eat it again!I absolutely adored the rice pudding, which arrived with a deliciously crunchy caramelised top, a subtle orange aroma and the tart rhubarb to cut through the sweetness of it all.The only criticism is that the waitress wanted to charge us for a drink we didn't order (\u00a38.75) and we had to fight our corner to demonstrate it wasn't us who ordered it!A good dining experience overall.",

Upon entry, waitresses greeted us with glasses of champagne and we were never left with empty glasses. (Cheers to that!!) Even though their menu options for large groups was very \"protein\" centric, they were outstandingly accommodating to my being vegan. At no additional cost they prepared a vegan starter and main, that varied from the rest of the group. They were also very respectful of food allergies. The beet root carpaccio (pictured) was delicious. The beer root was very thinly sliced, topped with fresh arugula and drizzled with balsamic glaze. For my main, the staff crafted up a vegan risotto with barley as the center of the dish accompanied by squash and leafy greens. The squash had a truly smoky flavor and the barley was perfectly cooked. I would absolutely recommend booking an event here if you need a private room or space for a large group of guests. The accommodating nature, the vibes, the food, and the attentive service will ABSOLUTELY win you over!! Thank you, Hush!!",

Then when someone did come over, he didn't even apologise for making us wait! Service did not improve from there. I had to ask for tap water three times! Really not acceptable. There was also no accommodation for food requests - the monkfish came on a bed of beans and chorizo. I asked for it without the chorizo as I eat fish but not meat. Apparently that was not possible as the beans and chorizo were pre-mixed. Any decent chef could have whipped up an alternative base for the monkfish, especially as the menu is pretty extensive.The food we did order was good. Hence the 3 stars. Though good but not great. My watermelon and feta salad ticked all the right boxes. My lobster/crab salad was also enjoyable. The sourdough with maple butter was delicious (who'd a thought!).",

We had a table outside in the courtyard (despite the rain) and it is tucked away off Regent Street and away from the tourist hell of Oxford Street. We were given the brunch menu (which looks amazing), ordered, then told brunch had ended. So ordered from their lunch menu which to be honest I've had better small plates else where in London and better value for money. The food itself is really good. The service isn't great. Inattentive staff who don't know the menu. Overall a bit mediocre.",

Well, my colleague I was with took one mouthful and took an immediate swig of water, I persevered for a few more spoons and then decided it was making me feel a bit icky. \u00a0However, there were 2 people at our table that demolished it, so maybe the result on that dessert should be 50/50.On the way out the first floor bar looks really enticing and \u00a0my colleague and I are probably going to go back to give it a try on the first floor, ordering what we want and enjoying drink at the stylish bar.Downstairs the patio outside seating area was full of people. \u00a0I don't know though if this is the place people go so they can say \"oh darling we're off to Hush for lunch\" rather than a quiet location that they go to enjoy fine food. \u00a0Currently I think it is the former.....The toilets are delightful though. \u00a0Very clean and smelt divine.The staff are brilliant.",

    "text": "The visit of Glasgow Elite Martyn M to London gave Andrew M and me an excuse to go out for another dinner. Not that a Yelper needs any excuse to go out for dinner!We agreed on Hush as the menu looked promising. The name Hush suggests that they want to keep it a secret and indeed, the restaurant is a little hidden away off the main street. A word of warning to ladies wearing high heels - the path is downhill and cobbled - Andrew and I were royally entertained by a pair of glammed up ladies struggling down in their high heels. We did offer to help but our chivalry was \u00a0declinedIt was one of those in between London weather days and we weren't sure whether to sit in their inviting outdoor area or play safe and sit indoors. In the end, we went safe!The restaurant certainly aims to be high end and the clientele fit that bill. Opposite the upstairs bar, there is a wall of various celebrities doing the shush finger to lips poseBeing typical Yelpers, talking made it hard to order but we eventually managed to get starters of dressed Dorset crab with avocado and the pulled pork, Yorkshirepudding, apple and calvados. These were a good start to the meal. The crab was freshly picked and given enough pep to liven it up and still be the starring main ingredient. The pulled pork was good by British standards but can't match the American BBQ jointsFor main, I enjoyed my half lobster with taglierini, tomato and chilli, which once again had nice ingredients to lift the starring lobster. Martyn pronounced himself very pleased with his steak. I think Andrew regretted not getting steak as well because his fishcake was rather dry and underwhelmingWe rounded off our meal with blackberry sorbet, Mar bar cheesecake and sticky toffee puddingA great evening with a visiting Yelper. Food was 4 stars overall if you ignore the fishcake but they lose a star for the price",

    "text": "Located on Lancashire Court, tucked away behind loads of buildings, lies Hush. I did have to ask for directions to get here even whilst I was on the street, but I got here in the end.Last night I was invited to a yelp event dinner by Yee Gan O, who arranged a dinner for me whilst I was down in London, which was delightful! Andrew M also attended, and it was fantastic getting to make more friends through Yelp outside of Glasgow. I arrived early, and so had a glass of white wine, which was gorgeous, while I waited. Shortly after the others turned up, we set to ordering. We were actually talking so much I think ordering 2 courses took us about half an hour, but eventually we managed it. Yee Gan and I both opted for the Crab & Avocado Salad to start, whilst Andrew went for the Pulled Pork. Both were absolutely delicious and went down a treat. Then for mains Yee Gan went for the half lobster, Andrew for the Salmon Fishcakes, and I went for the fillet steak with b\u00e9arnaise sauce. My steak was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. The homemade chips left a lot to be desired though, but I've often found that good steaks come with bad chips. The two guys both cleaned their plates, and food satisfaction was had for me. I've noticed that I'm the first person to review this place with 5*, but I genuinely cannot fault my experience here. The decor is absolutely stunning, the food was excellent and the service was great. It's definitely a place pretty people like to go to be seen and spend money, but that didn't influence my enjoyment. I had blackberry sorbet for dessert, which was gorgeous and sweet and delicious and rich and I just love sorbet. Andrew had the mars bar cake and Yee Gan had the hot chocolate fudge cake. Definitely recommend this place. Excellent food, excellent service and everything excellent in between. It's definitely on the pricey side, and the 12.5% service charge is popped on at the end, but I thoroughly enjoyed Hush.",

Love the cocktails as well, they've got the standard ones you'd expect to see and a few of their own creations which are super tasty! Oh and don't forget the desserts!! I loooove the raspberry and white chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the mars bar cheesecake is divine!

    "text": "Hush is one of those hidden just out of sight restaurants that you hear about but never quite end up going to try on a whim because...well you just don't see it. I assume it's called Hush to imply it's a secret dining escape in the middle of the city or perhaps they just want you to shut up and stop whining about the tourists. First off, the entrance is a little deceptive as the most obvious route from Oxford Circus actually takes you to the back entrance. Now this entrance has an awning over the door which says \"Hush\" so you wouldn't be faulted for thinking perhaps they are going the speakeasy route with a \u00a0very minimalist entrance. Nope, the actual entrance (and fairly large outdoor seating area) is just around the corner. Ladies beware - the path is cobblestoned which would make heels a tricky proposition unless you have a handy gent's arm for support (unless said gent is also wearing heels in which case you're outta luck).The interior is elegant with small but comfortable dining area on the ground floor and a pretty slick bar on the upper floor. \u00a0However, despite having a number of friendly staff around, service seemed a bit slow. Perhaps it's because we were chatting away and had to ask for a couple of minutes more the first time, but surely that's no reason to forget about us?We had been discussing various approaches to slow cooked meats, and with this on my mind I had to opt for the pulled pork starter. Now, if you've been following my reviews, you probably know I'm partial to a burger and considered trying the Hush burger until I found out it was merely a patty on a bun with a bit of lettuce as a garnish. For \u00a313, I expect a little more style in a dish particularly for a place trying to be as glam as Hush. Instead I opted for the fish cake - a choice I later came to regret.The pulled pork was tender and juicy but the marinade and sauce leant more towards sickly sweet rather than the full bodied tangy flavours I've come to associate with such a dish. The saut\u00e9ed apple in a calvados reduction didn't help matters at all nor did the brioche shell it was served in. Overall, it felt as if they had tried to make a pulled pork dessert - an odd choice in general and even more so when considering this was designed as a starter.My main was singularly disappointing and lacked in flavour, creativity, and all round taste. The salmon fishcake was under seasoned and overcooked and the tomato relish, while tasty, was provided in insufficient quantity to add sufficient flavour to each bite. However, the side of parmesan truffle fries were excellent and I confess I was greedy and ate more than my fair share of that. I'd happily go back for that time and time again as a snack with a drink. My dining companions confirmed that their food also was perfectly fine just lacking that wow factor you'd hope for given the level of style (and price) that Hush aims for.Finally, dessert! We shared a selection of the sticky toffee pudding, black berry sorbet, and Mars Bar cheesecake with praline ice cream. The star of the show was definitely the sticky toffee pudding with was rich, sweet, and fluffy - exactly what you want in such a pudding. The blackberry sorbet was tart and refreshing and couldn't be faulted. The Mars Bar cheese intrigued me as I wasn't expecting to find a dessert based on a candy bar in such a place. To be honest, it was just a cheesecake with a bit of chocolate and wafer but little resemblance to my memory of a Mars Bar (granted it's been a while since I've had one - do they even sell them in the UK?). Overall, probably the best course of the night.All in all, I'd say Hush is a nice place for a drink (and some parmesan truffle fries) but given the stiff competition from other restaurants in the area (Sketch, Little & Pollen Social, etc) I think it needs to up its game if it wants to compete on the restaurant front. But given that it was quite full even on a Wednesday, perhaps there is enough of a market even for them!",
