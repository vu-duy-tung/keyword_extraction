Ideal place to watch football with your mates and if you want to get drunk the waitresses are brilliant at getting pushy with your order. They are open both for lunch and dinner 7 days a week.. You can't help feel a bit naughty (tongue & cheek kind) if your in a big group.

Whenever I have been the atmosphere has been brilliant. The music can often be a bit euro-cheese but let yourself get caught up in it. There are often people dancing on the tables, the bar staff and waitresses join in the singing and dancing as well. So if you're tired of minimalist bars and expensive vodka cokes try a different night out. Plonk yourself down at one of the long wooden tables at the Bavarian bierhaus, order a litre (or a half!) of German ale and get ready to sing along with some catchy euro tunes.

The tables are long and people sit in rows on either side of each other. I chose to order an Erdinger lager, served in huge stein glass which is approximately 1.7 pints, (which feelsl like a lot more) which will set you back a cool seven pounds and twenty pence. The beer was nice and refreshing, although if you are a slow drinker, the bottom of your stein glass may not taste as nice towards the end. My only quabbles would be that service was a bit slow as you cannot order a drink from the bar, instead you must order and wait for it to be brought to you, but apart from that there is a nice friendly atmosphere and I would definitely return there again.",

It was like the cheap, happy food you get in Germany, but double the price, and with less atmosphere. I took a photo of my schnitzel, but the sauce makes it look like someone threw up on a plate of chips...so I think posting it would be mean to the Bavarians. Sam's goulash looked better...so maybe I just had food envy.The size of beer was impressive, maybe that is why folks love this place???

Compared to Bierschenke, the Bavarian Beerhouse just doesn't cut it - the food is not as good, the variety is not as wide, the atmosphere is not as fun and authentic (here, the German theme seems like more of a novelty than genuine effort).BUT all this being said, if all you are looking for is just a good pint (or hell, a stein!) of delicious lager/wheat beer, this place definitely does deliver. As I said, I wouldn't go for the food, and it's also quite a loud spot for conversations - but I gotta give them the stars for the delicious beer, which on some days is all you really need.",

All the food is delicious (the schnitzel is definitely my favourite but the sausages are also pretty great). I also really enjoy the Erdinger Weisbier (I think it's much nicer than its black equivalent) so I'd recommend trying that one. They have lots of other delicious German beers for you to try too. The atmosphere in there is great especially when there's a match on and it gets pretty packed in the weekend. If you go on a week night though it can be pretty dead so just take a big group of your friends with you and enjoy having the place almost entirely for yourselves. Finally, you can always count on this venue to be a great place during octoberfest, with girls dressed as Bavarian beer maids \u00a0bringing a true German vibe to the heart of East London.",

This night will get rowdy and right up there in your face. If you're a bit of a gobby loud tit like me you're at the right place!Down the stairs you descend into the poorly decorated general function room that is das bierhaus. This place ain't no looker but just accept that and move on, after all you're here to DRINK. You are led to and placed at your long communal pasting table by your very own authentic Germanic \"Stein Frau\" or Beer Lassie, who dressed in traditional Bavarian dress, takes your orders (and terrible GCSE German lines (which you think are hilarious but she has heard 3 times that evening already)) For the full experience order the Steins (or \"two-pint-pints\") of some seriously strong frothy German lagers and prepare yourself for some seriously raucous fun. Any newbies to drinking you have probably taken a wrong turn somewhere but can still order a normal pint and ger' involved.This has to be the only place in London which actively promotes extreme drunkardness and daft rowdiness from all attendees. One stein down each and our table is well on their way and needs little encouragement to smash our next full beers together in a group \"Prost!\", chug as much Weiss beer down as possible and let out a tremendous collective roar to neighbouring tables; continuing on to create a kind of Mexican wave from table to table; standing, shouting and raising steins. Proper hit the jackpot the first time here. Lucky enough to have the Bavarian Band, consisting of a fat guy in lederhosen on a big brass horn thang, and the other fatty German leprechaun crunching away at his accordion. This pair o' champs were churning out a rhythmic beat to which everyone in the place was swinging, hollering and smashing steins together. Every table in the place was swaying and losing beer to the floor like some kind of doomed u-boat from Das Boot. The atmosphere in there was \u00faber-fantastic, I lost the plot at one point with some serious giggly beer froth choking as the band got everyone going mental with the next drink beat mash up.I wouldn't advise going on a first date here! The food is a bit shoddy and rate expensive, see pic of my \u00a312 frankfurter delight! Mmmmm, I would advise to avoid. Apart from that and the Stein Frau's not looking like the ones on the website it's a real good place to hit with a crowd. Ring up and book (for \u00a0free) at weekends as it's popular.Let it all go peeps, order another stein and maintain eye-contact during \"Prost!\" and you're on for ein guten nacht.",

Initially thinking the the prices were a bit steep I gathered that the \u00a38.10p was for a two pint (1.13 litres) stein. So, just over four pounds for a pint for some good German beer, cheaper than many pubs that serve the same or similar beers. Fair enough, I'll have a Erdinger weisbier - a BIG one! Upon inspection of the decoration, I wasn't too impressed. It's just cobbled together with some Erdinger lamps hanging from the walls and an Elk head in between some of them. It's quite basic, mostly just benches and tables filling this unglamourous function room with a bar taking up one side of the room. There is no service to be had at the bar however as all service is conducted via the numerous blond leiderhosen-clad waitresses. They offer food in very large portions indeed. The quality of which isn't great but if you have the beer munchies then you may not be that fussed. Not the best sausages (three varieties) and mash by a long way but the hole was successfully filled. The Schnitzels were also OK. All in all, I did enjoy my Bavarian Beerhouse experience but that enjoyment was through a beery haze and a raucous stag party (but not as raucous as the tables around us, not sure what they were celebrating).Ta ta for now, Ian",

As more of a wine-lover, I was impressed by the Riesling also on offer, and was also pleasantly surprised by the food, which is hearty, filling and with good, well-chosen options for vegetarians. Staff are very friendly and wear traditional Bavarian garb. My main criticism of this bar would be the fact that it's housed in a basement, completely light-free room that is mostly featureless, which doesn't make it feel especially cosy (a saving grace of many underground pubs). However the staff ensure a warm welcome for all, and it's a brilliant lively venue, especially for large groups or on special occasions - we went along for Eurovision, which suited the BB perfectly. Finally though, a bar of this size really, really needs more than one ladies' toilet, and I'm afraid I'm deducting a star on that point alone!",
