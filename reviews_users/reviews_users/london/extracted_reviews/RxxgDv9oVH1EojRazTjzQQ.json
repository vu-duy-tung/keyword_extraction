The only hitch however is that the food is not authentic Indian and is more of a curry joint. I somehow find Masala Zone (especially the one at Earl's Court) and Mela closer to authentic Indian food. Having said that, cannot take the credit from Bengal for serving tasty food at honest to earth prices. They have a \"lunch box\" deal that serves rice and curry for 5 quid and is a steal.",

I'm now happy that I've finally found Bengal Tiger because the food is great and the people are nice! I can especially recommend the chicken saag, in which they use a good mix of different spices, which harmonise well! Moreover the naan is super fresh. It always comes directly out of the oven!

After dinner we wanted espresso or latte macchiato but we could only order coffee or tea. The coffee which was served was by far the worst cup of coffee I've ever encountered in my life.

    "text": "I recently visited this restaurant again after one year away from the UK and found my favorite dishes ( tandoori , king prawn chili garlic curry as well as vindaloo Madras and Bhuna curries ) still as delicious as ever . I was however a bit perturbed that there were not many customers and therefore wonder why. One explanation is that food trends seem to be changing and not many people are now familiar with the real hard core Bengali/ Bangladeshi dishes any more. One thing I suggested to the owner is to not use tin prawns and always use king prawns and charge a little bit more which would make such a difference to the taste and quality. I have now departed this great city and am looking forward to visiting the Bengal again next year",

Overall a nice option if you like Indian food.",

I went here with 13 other people and I saw it had really good reviews so we went for dinner. The service was amazing, especially Fazi who helped us tremendously. The food was delicious and I recommend sharing the dishes with people because they are pretty big portions for just one person. Everything was yummy and flavorful! If I ever come back to London, I will be visiting again. :)",

Not the best Indian I've encountered in London but quite all right nevertheless. It's a small place, had few others at 6:30pm on Monday. Service was very quick and friendly. Would I return? Yeah, value for money was good even though it was not a full five star experience as such",

For the price, I was expecting a lot more flavor -- and, unfortunately, the restaurant just couldn't deliver. To start, I got the lamb samosas. These were really disappointing. There was hardly any filling in them. The filling was pretty good, but this was mostly just fried dough. \u00a0For my entr\u00e9e, I got the chicken tikka masala and some plain rice. The chicken was cooked really well and was actually very soft. However, the dish was lacking in the flavor department. I know tikka is not supposed to be overwhelmingly spicy, but mine just tasted very bland. More spice, less tomato would have been nice. Overall, not my favorite. The meal was okay, but there are many better options nearby that I would check out first.",

The reason for this is that the food is on the same level but they have nicer staff who are usually able to recommend you good meal or adjust it how you like it. Last time I went they made our food saucier than it was supposed to be :) Another reason is that they serve alcohol here.Check out their new lunch deal with a starter and main course for (I believe) 6 pounds.",

It's pretty tiny, tucked into the street so you may not notice it too much when you walk by. The staff was very friendly and made good recommendations when we asked for it.The great thing for me was that they had a wide selection of vegetarian food (which is often vegan if it doesn't have cheese or butter). I asked for a recommendation and ordered the vegetable naga bhuna, which was a spicy veggie stew with a bunch of vegetables like eggplant, cauliflower, potatoes, chickpeas etc. I loved that it was actually spicy and it went great with some jasmine rice. My friend ordered a butter chicken with chapati and she said that was delicious too. Service was quite fast and I thought the food was really authentic and very affordable (by London standards). For my first Indian food experience in London, Bengal didn't disappoint.",
