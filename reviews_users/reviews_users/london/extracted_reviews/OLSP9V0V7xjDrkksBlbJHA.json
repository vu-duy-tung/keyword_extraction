    "text": "NEVER DINE HERE!Reuben's is by far the worst place. Ever.I peered through the kitchen window and was disgusted by what I witnessed.I can't believe they call this restaurant kosher. I highly doubt the food is kosher and the owners Jewish although they claim to be. There was no rabbinical supervision at all and the chef did not cover his hair. The salads were literally 5 pieces of lettuce. Nothing else was on the plate. I also ordered a soup which was way too salty. I ordered the grilled chicken entr\u00e9e and a steak entr\u00e9e, both of which were drowned in salt and garlic to mask the bitterness. The chicken was rubbery and the steak was overcooked and so hard and rough in texture. They brought out the wrong chicken entr\u00e9e and when I let them know it was not what I had ordered the owner began to yell at me and tell me I was wrong. She showed me attitude and embarrassed in front of everyone. I couldn't believe it. Service was slow and served with much attitude. They never asked us if we needed anything throughout the meal. We didn't even have napkins at our table. They tried to add things to our bill which we had never ordered and when we asked to take home our leftovers to give to a homeless person, they brought it to us in a dirty, used container. The owner's daughter who was waiting tables, was unbelievably nasty and rude and unprofessional. I have never been treated like this at any establishment in my whole life. If you are looking for kosher food, forget about Reuben's. It was the worst experience of my life and I wish I could take back this experience. Do yourself a favour and stay away.",

I've been craving a salt beef sandwich fix for some time and so I hit the brakes (nearly causing a crash no less), tied up the bike and went in. Saw the salt beef under the heater, it looked good. I was salivating!Ordered salt beef on rye. Fairly stingy serving of beef went in the sandwich. I was a little disappointed to watch him make it actually. No love, no stacking of the beef. Certainly nothing like NYC. Oh well. I go to pay. \"That'll be \u00a38.75\". Whaaaaat? For the sandwich I've just seen your colleague make? Really? Or is mine still yet to be made and will be twice the size and adorned with pickles? No? Oh. Well. Err... here's the money then. Ouch. I asked for a pickle. Was told they're \u00a32 each.

When I asked if the sandwiches included pickles the gentleman said \"no, you need to pay for the pickle.\" \u00a0I decided that I just had to have a dill pickle or two to complement the sandwich so I told him to charge me for the pickles. To my dismay when I got back to my hotel to eat the sandwich the pickles were SWEET GERKINS which were horrible. Had to throw them out. Worst part is that I had to pay 20 British Pounds and 10 Pence which is the equivalent of $30.00. When I didn't have the 10 Pence, the woman made me break a 10 pound note. They just couldn't overlook 10 Pence. Other comments about this kosher restaurant---floors were sticky and there were storage cartons strewn within sight of the diners. Just looked tacky---no class. \u00a0Don't waste your money. Reuben's is a kosher restaurant with 'attitude'---will never ever frequent this restaurant again.",

(corned beef for our American friends)Enough kvetching already. This is a Glatt kosher deli / restaurant in central London ... I had to try.For a restaurant, the salt beef is spectacular. Thickly sliced right in front of you, no fat whatsoever. Not as good as your grandmother's, obviously.Next, the chicken soup. kneidlach + lokshen. (matzo ball + noodles).Well, it deserves cookie points for existing. Now, the chicken stock was a bit too concentrated, and lacking vegetables. Strangely yellow too... hard to imagine it as a full chicken or schmaltz stock... Unless the chicken was actually dyed yellow...The kneidlach were moist but seemed to have a bit too much egg yoke for my taste. Overall, a good sample of somebody else's grandmother recipe, I am sure.The menu boasting things like barley and beans soup, beef tongue or gefilte fish, I'll have to come back. No herring though );As noted by previous reviewers, you'll find no Reuben sandwich here.The law clearly says: \"put cheese on your beef, and you'll burn in hell\". In the present case, the salt beef is so good, that if you think it needs Swiss cheese, you truly deserve your place in a bottomless pit.Note from the editor : the pastrami on rye bread sandwich is a New York thing. Salt beef on cumin bread is perfectly kosher too ;) Get over it.Finally, if you read all of that and are British, I just have to ask...Deep fried gefilte fish? really? Even in Louisiana they haven't dared...Is it any good?",

Their English is poor and they look unhappy to be there. There are no menus. After shoe-horning ourselves round one of the tightly packed tables, we had to then go back to the front door to look at the confusingly laid out menu on a big TV. (Headings were 'chicken' and 'meat' rather than 'starters' and 'mains'). We took my parents for Sunday lunch when visiting us for the weekend. Waitress led us though the slightly busy ground floor ad hoc seating and down to the more formal area downstairs. She turned the lights on for us as we were the only souls there. We turned around and headed back upstairs. Tables are set up for 4 and we received no help rearranging for a 5th chair. I went to order some drinks and was told I had to pay there and then. Drinks and glasses placed on the top and when I asked if they could place them on a tray so I could carry them back to the table, I was told in broken English \"Self-service, you get tray, over there!\" In terms of value, suffice it to say that we paid \u00a394 for 5 sandwiches (which were nice and well filled but the rye was pre-sliced and too thin so it went very soggy and fell apart) plus 2 chips, 2 wings, 2 salads and 5 soft drinks. One final gripe if you can bare to carry on reading to the end, was being shouted at by 2 waitresses when ordering salad plates. There was an unwritten rule that said if you would like more than 2 salads you must pay for a 'portion' on smaller plates rather than put them on one big plate. One waitress took the plate from her colleague and scraped our food onto two smaller plates. We were passed objecting at that point and just watched bemused. Reubens are clearly trading on uniqueness of Kosher in town but they have forgotten that to remain in business, people want to come back. We won't.",

    "text": "The Reuben \u00a0at Reuben's \u00a0now this is a sandwich! For mighty sandwiches and Kosher delights, head to Reuben's in the heart of Marylebone on Baker Street.Don't like salt beef? Then you might as well stop reading now. But if you do like salt beef (and to like it is to love it!), by all means make yourself at home because I'm about to discuss a most glorious salt beef sandwich. It's the Reuben sandwich which is available at Reuben's restaurant, the West End's only Kosher restaurant. It's stacked to the sky with tomatoes, gherkins, sauerkraut, hot mustard and ample salt beef between two pieces of rye bread. The thing's so big it's almost impossible to hold with just two hands.Now, I'm not sure if this West End sarnie is a derivation of the American born deli classic by the same name or not, but there are definitely similarities. Salt beef is certainly a suitable British substitute for pastrami or corned beef (which you'd find mounds of within an American Reuben) and all the other ingredients are part of the American sandwich too. However, the US Reuben would have Swiss Cheese and/or Thousand Islands dressing (or some other dairy-based condiment) and our Baker Street version does not. I can only imagine that's simply to keep Kosher (by not mixing meat and dairy). Anyway, as much as I like the standard non-kosher US version, I'm more than content with this non-dairy Kosher style sandwich available at Reuben's. Beyond the massive sandwich, Reuben's is a brilliant setting for a meal. The cafeteria-esque counter service makes ya feel all retro and the Star of David logo-ed plates et al \u00a0along with the probability of there being more diners donning kippah skullcaps than not \u00a0offers an atmosphere that's more Tel Aviv or Lower East Side Manhattan than Central London. I've only been to Reuben's a few times, and each time I've had the Reuben (which will set ya back about nine quid). I'll go again (and soon!). I've never seen it packed, but I've never seen it even close to empty. It's a cool place with a particularly unique atmosphere for this side of Central London.",

This strictly Glatt Kosher restaurant serves a soup loaded with pearl barley and butter beans that's a perfect antidote to a cold, damp day. Their version of Beef Wellington - a rib-eye steak slathered with chopped liver, then encased in pastry and topped with mushroom sauce - is to die for, and the fried chicken breast stuffed with fresh mango also is delectable. Their salt beef (corned beef to us Yanks) is nicely seasoned, not fatty, and possibly the best I've had. I don't remember ever seeing mince pie on a restaurant menu but they serve it here and it's delicious. Unlike the Jewish delis in New York, this one has ambience - they even have linen tablecloths! - and the service is polite and friendly and you won't feel rushed.",

    "text": "Heed to the advice on almost all other reviews for Reubens and stick to the upper-floor deli. Land early for lunch, or very late, for the place is super busy during peak lunch hours.Onto the food then--anything from the sandwiches portion of the menu is sure to leave you (a) full and (b) content. The meat is amazing, whatever it be. I generally stick to salt beef on rye with mustard. But a shoutout must go to the schnitzel, which is outstanding. Unlike a lot others I have had, this one's still moist on the inside--perfectly breaded and seasoned. It's a party in your mouth! And a mention to the humble chips. They are gorgeously thick cut, yet crunchy on the outside--a perfect accompaniment to the sandwiches.Nice place, warm people!",

Sure, I regularly question the logic that people of a specific ethnicity are best suited to rate their own cuisine, I mean, my buddy Raj doesn't know fuck all about food, but suddenly his Indian recommendations are indubitable, utter bullshit. \u00a0Rueben's salt beef is great. \u00a0It's better than the Brass Rail at Selfridges by a shtetl mayl, which is actually one of two things I've had there, the other being matzo ball soup. \u00a0The matzo ball soup is not fantastic; the broth tastes instant and the kneidlach are heavy and not particularly flavourful. Annoyingly, if they run out of bagels they insist you buy a half or full sandwich which aren't as good a value, if \u00a36.75 for a bagel sandwich can be considered a good deal.If you like to either feel very at home if you're Jewish, or probably kind of out of place if you're not, Reuben's is your spot!",

Do it. Some colleagues and I popped in for a takeaway lunch a few days ago and were pleasantly there just as they opened for lunch (1130am). I went with a chopped liver sandwich (very rich), but really should've gone for the corned beef sandwich -- which is a MONSTER. The salads looked fresh and dense, and my lautchen was a super sweet treat with sultanas, vermicelli noodles and a bright yellow color. Delicious when warmed up! The \"mom\" of the shop was a true treat and she treated us like family! *10 percent off when using check in offer (upstairs deli only) via Yelp app. Loved my first visit to the deli, much different experience than upstairs.* Deli is cash only.",

I'd spied chicken schnitzel as we entered so I had to go for that. It was a little pricey (around \u00a311) but it was worth it - it was nearly the size of the plate. They'll bring your food out to your table so don't stand around waiting (like we did!). The seating area is pretty casual and relaxed. Your meal is brought out to you so make sure you pick up cutlery when you're ordering. I really liked the chicken schnitzel, nicely crispy with a really tasty chicken breast inside. It came with a salad which I avoided but it looked nice and fresh. This place was great. Comfortable, relaxed, friendly and tasty food. You also get 10% off for checking in - the staff knew about this deal and seemed excited to have a bunch of Yelpers in. So make sure you use it! I'd definitely come back here as everyone who ate here (all 8 of us) were happy/overjoyed with their meals. Pretty great result in my opinion.",

On arrival we got a lovely welcome from a gentleman who appeared to be the owner, who also explained to us about some of the dishes on offer and about the more formal restaurant downstairs. We eat in the buzzing deli upstairs, which made a nice change eating dinner in an establishment offering the more informal yet hard to find (especially in the evening) counter service. We thoroughly enjoyed the salt beef sandwich, which was excellent, and the meatballs and the latke which I had never tried before washed down with kosher wine. The gentleman with who we spoke to on arrival also came up to us during our meal and asked if everything was okay, which it definitely was.We will definitely be back, and we're not even Jewish, so go on and give it a try whatever your faith.",

They had literally every delicacy from my childhood for me to ooh and ahh over, including the motherlode of all Jewy greatness -- gefilte fish. \u00a0My grandmother took the recipe for her homemade gefilte fish to the grave, so it is my proverbial \"madeleine.\" Just one taste of a great gefitle can send me reeling back in time to my grandma's dining room table surrounded by aunts, uncles and cousins during our holiday family meet-ups. So when I spotted not one, but two kinds of gefilte at Reuben's I knew what I had to order. For variety sake, I chose the deep fried gefilte fish which I'd never seen before and it was amazing. Not greasy at all, the fish was the perfect consistency, delicately flavored and presented in elegant slices along with a ramekin of incredible homemade horseradish. Even my non-Jewish dining partners tried it and loved it, which is quite a statement. Every thing else we had at our table --from schnitzel and corned beef to hummous, beet salads and latkes -- was fantastic. Even though we enjoyed a 10% reduction thanks to their Yelp check-in offer, my one critique (and therefore the four instead of 5 stars) was the fact that they accept only cash, not easy when you're paying for a table of ten.",

The fish and chips was a serving for two and the batter was golden brown and twice what's usually found. The brisket was fantastic. The schwarma was great although no better than at a good doner shop-- so the fact that it is kosher is the selling point for the schwarma.
