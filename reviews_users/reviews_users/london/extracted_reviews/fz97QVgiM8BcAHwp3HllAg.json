    "text": "I will start by confessing that I was a little bit skeptical when I saw that Vapianos was being launched in the UK. \u00a0It is a massive chain in Germany (the Germans *love* Italian food from what I can gather, don't we all), but the 'Oyster card for your food' didn't seem like it would take off here at first.However, after several impromptu visits to Vapianos I can advocate that I am a massive fan. \u00a0Looks its not brain surgery, it's pizza, pasta and salads. \u00a0They have daily specials, they cook the food in front of you, and if there is an ingredient that you do not want to be included in your dish, they will leave it out for you. \u00a0The staff reliably inform me that the pizza and pasta are all baked/made fresh each morning, and the staff are all very house proud which is always nice.The seating is a free for all and you can hide away in a dark corner in the back, on a cushy sofa or table by the window or on the mezzanine level upstairs.There's also a separate coffee bar for the post-dining caffeine hit, or you can come here just for coffee. They really don't care, just come and pay a visit, you're always welcome.I've come here at different times of day on different days of the week, and with spring upon us, it always has a nice and relaxed vibe, inside and out (there is some outdoor seating now as well - if you can avoid being caught out by the wind).With free gummy bears available at the till, there are really no downsides to this place. Friends who I have brought here are always pleasantly surprised at this hidden gem (just a stone's throw from the chaos of Oxford Circus) and they have themselves spread on the good word.I mean it, enjoy.x",

    "text": "God my review couldn't really be much further from my fellow Yelpers.I had a really awful experience here last week and have been telling everyone who'll listen. I was persuaded by a German friend who prescribed it was the best thing since sliced bread, well in Germany at least. We went in about 6:30 on a Wednesday evening, it was buzzy and bright.I headed straight for one of the many banks of people waiting for pasta. I chose my pasta after a minute or two and 10 minutes later I was still waiting to have my order taken. Another 5 minutes more went by and I finally got to order my Fig & Spicy Sausage Pasta. Another few minutes a swipe of my card and I had a tray and a big bowl of pasta.By the time I had arrived at the table my companion had about a third of a cold pizza left and a lonely look on her face. I sat down and was glad too see she had been prepared enough to buy drinks for us both, as I certainly wasn't going to venture back out.So to the reason people come here 'apparently'. My Fig & Spicy Sausage Pasta had plenty of fresh fig, which pleased me, but last time I checked there was a difference between Italian Spicy Sausage and peperoni. This is the kind of school boy error that Pizza Hut would make and I wouldn't expect of a place that charges nearly \u00a39 for a bowl of pasta, accompanied by the privilege of queuing 20 minutes. It doesn't help there are a few perfectly fine Italian chains a block away.I decided to order a salad and park my pasta, and stupidly didn't check the prices beforehand. I really shouldn't have been surprised that the mozarella and tomato salad was about \u00a35. A large bottle of water later and a bill for over \u00a318, I wasn't a happy bunny...",

And some of the people that go there are starting to get a bit annoying - they seem to come in a big group, most of them going straight to a table, while only a few of them actually order food. The rest seem to think they're gangster because they \"have a table and a bottle at this popular place off Oxford Street on a Friday night\". It just gets a bit tiring when I want to eat dinner and be on my way, yet have to wait for ages in line (like in a canteen) and then have to wait for a space at a shared table. The food is decent and the prices pretty good, but I'm starting to think it's really not worth it.",

The whole system is hugely inefficient.If they let you order pizza and give you a buzzer to collect your order, why not do the same for the pasta? why make ppl wait in line for 1 chef to cook pasta for 8 ppl infront of me, which means i have to waste 40 mins just waiting to be served and then another 10 mins for my pasta to be cooked.Only go if you're going to order pizza, not worth wasting time for half-decent pasta.Sorry Vapiano - I don't like leaving bad reviews, but you leave me no choice.",

    "text": "I've recently been introduced to Vapiano's by a good friend, and I can't believe I didn't know this little Italian gem was hidden round the corner from Oxford Circus tube. Walk through the doors to be greeted by friendly staff who hand you something like a food credit card which you use for payment later and go through to find yourself a nice spot either in the lounge area or on the bench style tables. The concept is DIY so don't expect any service after this initial greeting, I think this is why we all like it so much, it's less formal and you are left to your own devices. Each different food station serves different food, so one for pasta, one for pizza, one for salad, and one for wine (that also serves as the dessert point). You queue at each and watch your meal being prepared in front of you. At this point everyone seems to split up and go on their meal mission, but then we all meet back at base when we've collected. The chefs are super nice and strangers often start chatting whilst they wait for their food, which is a novel thing here in London! Then when your food is ready, pop your card on the electronic reader and the cost has been added. Simple. I can't recommend the crayfish and lobster sauce and the beef tenderloin and mushroom pasta enough. They cook the pasta to perfection and everything is super fresh. One note though; the salad doesn't really seem worth the money, unless you get the 'Insalata Mista' which seems to have a bit of everything thrown in. You may be full by this point, but have a break before squeezing in a gorgeous panna cotta. I think they're the best I've had in London and at \u00a33.75 you can't say no.I love the vibrant atmosphere here and it's always the first place the girls decide to meet for our weekly round up. The fact that you all have your own food cash card means that there's no tallying up bills at the end (or even waiting for one) so you just settle up on the way out. Oh and the award for most basil plants in one restaurant must go to Vapiano's too!",

Mostly because the salad I had was amazing, accompanied by their fabulous ciabatta bread.  I caught a glimpse of the pizzas whizzing by, they looked far too saucy (giggle) and undercooked. I guess when people are standing about waiting, they chuck it in and out in about ten minutes. A decent pizza takes about 15 mins to cook (info garnered from a summer as a pizza slinging waitress who sometimes forgot orders). \u00a0I think the card thing is totally unnecessary, you should just order and pay at the till like Nandos. But I guess it gets the punters in and that's what they want. A solid three stars, I'd definitely go back.",

This always makes my homemade salads look posher when brought to work. Result. Food. Now, menu is slightly limited but you can add/mix toppings anyways as it's all cooked up fresh. Upon entering, you get given a 'credit card' and everything you purchase (food and drink) you swipe the card and then pay for it all upon exit. Sweeet. Think its quite easy not to I've heard as well. A-hem....Pasta, pizza's and salads come listed on menu in price ranges so there's something for all tastes and budgets which I love. Pasta line is always looooong tho which is a bit of a snore to be honest but food is lovely and so worth wait I guess. They make it all in front of you so you add whatever you like. Same with salads. For pizza's they give you a buzzer once you've ordered and you have to return to collect it once buzzed. Painful when upstairs though, sucks ass. Ambiance. Quite a loud, hectic sorta place really. Great for groups, not for couples or a quiet evening bite I would say. Location wise is great for an after work/shopping bite though. Never had a dessert here as always full to brim on carbs and beer. Classy. I do however always take a handful of sweetie (at till) for journey home.",

You look at the simple menus, choose what you would like, get up, go to the kitchen and tell the chefs what you want. They will cook it for you right in front of your eyes. The same goes for drinks, you have to go up to the bar and present your card to get one.The food is reasonably priced and with the card system it's pretty good to go with a group of friends as splitting the bill at the end is not a problem with all the cards.The food is tasty but nothing really to write home about. One thing that sets it apart from other Italian places in the area, or at least in my opinion, is the fact that the chiefs tell you what goes best together when creating your own dish. As it's service is a bit of a talking point this is a great first date place as well as it being relaxed and friendly with a funky crowd of people.The food is reasonably priced but the drinks do make the bill creep up.

    "text": "RFID used at a restaurant. This blew my silicon valley heart away and then it all felt a little like love. I was visiting some coworkers on Regent Street when they suggested going here. Normally the lunches we bring them to in the US consist of Chipotles, the work caffe, and In N Out. So when they suggested Chinese, German Italian food or some other cuisine, I definitely thought ok. It's been two weeks since I had pizza I will give that a whirl. We get there and at the front desk you need to pick up an RFID card. What? OMG RFID! Then they have various stands where you can get pasta made right for you, pizza, antipasti and calzones all at lunch time costs, as well as beer and other assorted drinks. Once you order you slide your RFID card up to the reader and they program in what you ordered. If you ordered a pizza you get a buzzer for when it's ready and if you ordered pasta they make it there for you on the spot. Ingredients are fresh, so fresh in fact that they have a mini greenhouse area filled with potted basil. Once you get your food you grab a pot and put it in the center of the table in the area designated for the pots. Can we say well thought out? The decorum is clean and bright upstairs and more medium mood lighting downstairs. Almost everyone in our group got the pizza and it was relatively inexpensive. I ordered the crudo pizza which was a tomato based item with mozzarella, prosciutto, and parmesan. \u00a0It was a large portion and delicious. My travel companion ordered pomodoro fresco e basilico with whole wheat pasta. It was delicious as well. Russell S. ordered a calzone which came out looking delicious. Did I mention they had RFID cards to take your order and pay by? Awesome. By the end you just hand the cashier your card on the way out and you're done.",

    "text": "The venue is large, clean and modern.On entry you are greeted and given a card (yes, the oyster card system everyone has mentioned already). If you haven't been there before they will explain how it works but it's very simple. Personally I like it. I don't know what all the fuss is about with the card system (that's why I like it in fact, there is no fuss).You can choose from salads and antipasti, pasta or pizza. For me it's pasta every time so haven't tried the pizza and it takes longer.You walk up to the counter, tell the chef which dish you would like and which type of pasta to go with it. They make it in front of you and you can specify if you want or don't want garlic, chili, cheese etc. - just add it all in for me.They have several specials each time. All pasta is fresh and made in the restaurant. Today I had the 'pasta cognac' with chicken, bacon, cream, peas, tomato sauce, a splash of cognac with linguine which I highly recommend if you see it next time.A good and satisfying portion size too. It's an efficient operation and tables are kept clean. It does get busy at peak times and I see people with their low reviews complaining about long queues. I don't deal with queues well either so for that reason I tend not to visit places when I know they will be super busy and go just before or after the busiest period. Maybe that's why I've never had to wait more than about 5 minutes which is pretty good in my book.Prices are reasonable for the location just off Oxford Circus where everywhere always seems crowded, all the time.So overall 4 stars for good food, clean efficient ambience, consistency in standard and reasonable value. I am definitely a fan.",

    "text": "Whenever I head to this place I'm always happy.One, because I know that no matter how many times I come, the seats in front of the in-house pasta maker are almost always empty so I get to watch pasta being made and the meals being cooked (yup, quite sad). Two, I know that I'm going to get pretty chunky sized portions of fresh, just cooked pasta/pizza/salads (not so many salads eaten admittedly). Three, it's really cheap for what it is, with great wines and staff that are a pleasure. The tacchino piccante is a really solid, spicy chicken pasta dish, the pizzas are fantastic (and the little gadget they give you to let you know when it has finished cooking actually causes you to be fixated on what is basically a buzzer for 5 minutes) and the desserts...oh the desserts. (Finally, and not really related, it's just around the corner from a really good Sam Smiths pub, The Cock Tavern).I've only eaten downstairs here (either at the big pot-tree or at the afore-mentioned anorak seat) but have been upstairs on occasion, where you'll see all of the herbs that they use on-site being grown inbetween the tables in miniature greenhouses. As things are a bit more open upstairs I'm not really that tempted to change my routine but most of my friends really enjoy the slightly different ambience.Main positives for me though are the cost versus the quality of food. I don't mind queueing for 2 or 3 minutes when you get the spectacle of seeing your food cooked in front of you, and I quite enjoy the idea of getting up and getting my own drinks (because it means you don't have to wait 5-10 minutes for your waiter to get back to you as per a standard restaurant). Great place.Slight side note- really solid second-date location as the place really is different so has more than a few talking points, and the fact that you have to get up to get your own food means you can either a) take a breather or b) look like the perfect gentleman by getting your partners food. Winner.Only minor issue you might have - if you're in a really sizeable group (8+) then you may have slightly different waiting times, akin to what can happen sometimes at Wagamamas. The atmosphere, novelty and food more than make up for this though.",

    "text": "Eh...not for the feint hearted. Admittedly, I'm easily overwhelmed, but when you have to enter into full-on, survival-of-the-fittest mode just to get a dinner tray and a menu, let alone a seat, it's a bit extreme for a dining situation. My memory of the place is a bit of a flurry, but I recall being somehow carried through the doors by the crowd rushing in behind me and instantly wanting to leave. Having a little plastic card shoved into my hand, I only vaguely knew what to do because a friend of mine had been there previously and explained the concept to me. Although many Yelpers complain about the card system, I think it's necessary to preserve any form of efficiency in a place as chaotic as Vapiano. (Imagine having to split the bill there. I shudder to think...) Apart from that, the concept seemed a contradiction in terms. You have to be polite and patient enough to stand around in a queue for half an hour, yet ruthless enough to fight to the death for you and your party to get a table together. And that's just before the starters arrive.One thing I would suggest to survive the experience is, (especially if you're with someone and you don't like being left on your own for too long) to try and order something similar. My friend stood in the queue for pasta whilst I sat holding a buzzer, waiting for my (albeit delicious) pizza. I would have stayed for dessert, but an evening at Vapiano presented itself to me as an eating, rather than dining experience. By all means, go there for the food. Go there for the friendly staff. Go there for the free gummy bears at the end. But if you want to eat your dinner with a friend and have great conversations you can actually hear without being elbowed in the ribs, I would suggest ordering to go.",

I know it's near Christmas and all that, but queueing and the self service is all a bit strange when you first arrive and your best friend who has been there, doesn't explain to you the concept. The staff are just meh. Not rude, not polite, just there for want of a better way to describe it. The food was alright. I had the bruschetta, which was tasty but then they didn't use proper red tomatoes... you know.. the ones with flavour.. so I had to a chuck a load of balsamic vinegar on it to make it taste of something. The pasta was OK. I had the fresh basil and tomato and my friend had the salami one which looked infinitely better than mine. So there I was, major food envy and a whole load of balsamic vinegar, pining after hers. I would come back here, possibly at lunch when it might be a bit quieter and you don't have to queue. It's an interesting idea and good for a quick bite to eat when you're the Oxford Circus area.",

On a sunny day I passed by a Vapiano restaurant in London and decided to go there soon to see, if it's as good in London as it is in Stockholm and Frankfurt. And it is. I really like the concept, that your food gets made right in front of you - fresh, but of course with prepared ingredients. The interior is quite simplistic, what I also appreciate. If you look for relatively cheap but still very good Italian food in central London, Vapiano is definitely the place to go to!",

The pizza and the mascarpone with strawberry desert were yummy too. The only problem: one of the queues closed down unexpectedly, while people were still waiting there. They all had to redistribute to other queues. That was quite a dick move.",

There are fresh pots of basil at every table for you to use with your meal. There are high ceilings and lots of light. If you go up stairs (which is an even nicer area to eat) you feel like you are in a commercial for a dining experience... and you really like it. Its the kind of place where you walk in and would not be surprised if Nicolas Cage sat down at your table with his shirt half unbuttoned, holding a wine glass and told you important information- seconds before an expensive car crashed through the window. That being said, the food was absolutely amazing. I had the daily special- rabbit in mustard sauce on spelt pasta and it was great. I think they might have over salted the water, but I didn't care. The deliciousness more than made up for it. I am a big fan. For this part of town, the prices are a steal. I wish I had known about this place when I was a student. Only problem: If you are starving, waiting in line for food is really annoying but good things come to those who wait.Eat here, young bunnies of London. Eat here!",

    "text": "Well what can I say about Vapiano?I've only been here once so far on a Friday night with friends. The place is massive inside and it was packed, as is expected on a Friday night a few minutes walk from Oxford Circus. The d\u00e9cor is modern minimalistic but tasteful and would remind most people of the cafeterias in universities, but better food!As you walk in through the main door you have to go through these enormous red velvet curtains blocking the entrance and are given a pay card to place your order. Big mama gave me my card and I was to encounter her many times that evening.I was very hungry so ordered a barbecue chicken pizza and a carbonara. The restaurant is self service and you add your orders to your pay card and pay when you leave; an idea I think is very clever as it works like an Oyster Card. Everything is very quick to collect apart from the pizza's which you are given a flashing buzzer to let you know when to return to collect it.My food was great. I loved the carbonara, my cheesecake for desert and the many bottles of wine. I was however, very disappointed with the pizza. If I order a barbecue chicken pizza then that's what I expect, not a medium pizza with 2 little strips of chicken across the entire pizza. If that's what I wanted then I could have gone for a boring margarita. They wouldn't give me more so a barbecue pizza is what I got in the end.Now I do love the idea of the place, it's a great concept. But there were a few problems with the place, which is why I had to knock a star off the rating I was going to give it.I did feel a lot more like I was back at uni in the cafeteria rather than in a nice restaurant. It's pretty loud and the tables are all packed closely together so it's hard to have a conversation as the conversations of people sitting next to you get merged into yours.Some of my friends were late and it was noisy inside I had to keep going outside to call them. Now I know a lot of people must try and sneak out without their pay card but I gave one of the cashiers my card and my ID to prove I was coming back in after making a few quick phone calls and every time I did this, Big mama insisted on patting me down like a TSA agent. I don't know if this was necessary or if she was doing it for thrills, but by the time I left I was glad she didn't get the rubber gloves out and take me into a dark room! I'll admit, I was a bit scared....OK so overall, great quality Italian food with a quick and efficient service. If Big mama is not on the door again then I will gladly try this place again, but I won't be ordering a chickenless chicken pizza again that's for sure!",

It's essentially a dining hall for office workers who are feeling nostalgic for the trays and queues of their uni days, but who have graduated to better food.Nobody at the front bothered to tell us how the system worked, and we were given two separate cards despite stating that we were just going to pay on one tab, which seemed a touch pointless. Figuring out how to order isn't rocket science, but a two-second introduction to the flow would have been nice.Veal with tuna sauce was dry, bruschetta was made with sad supermarket tomatoes that morning and they'd marinated in their own tears all day (apparently weeping for a lack of basil). Pasta was, well, pasta, with little meat, and the pizza was 'artistically' arranged with all the figs on one slice, blue cheese on another, tomatoes on another. I prefer my pizza toppings more socialistically-distributed, thanks.The ingredients, for the most part, seemed to be of good quality, and the pizza dough was solid, but this place just lacked any hint of heart and nobody seemed to take particular pride in their work, aside from the polite gentleman clearing tables.On the up side, you can skip the waterlogged desserts and get some Haribo gummy bears on the way out, paltry consolation prize though they may be.",

Ok Vaps is great, it's reliable, it's cool, it's a lot if things but over time the standard of food has slightly declined. I'm a regular & have been for a few years and so I've seen it's growth in popularity but I do hope they don't drop their standards any further. This is a great place to grab affordable food in central London, that will fill you up. Its a great first date or catch up with friends location because its busy but yet you can find your own space in the place. Even takeaways are great here, if only for the bowls they give :)!",

    "text": "Quite a simple concept here. You get a charge card, order your food at the relevant counter and swipe the card to record your order. Once you're done eating, just hand the card to the cashier and you're billed for whatever you've racked up on the card. I've seen this concept used to greater effect in the US. Vapiano only boasts a pasta, pizza and antipasti/insalate station. It would be nice if someone expanded on this concept and offered a meat section, stir-fry, seafood, crepe station, etc.I get their canteen type concept: order what you want, when you want and sit where you like. It works well for singles or couples wanting a quick lunch. But this still doesn't stop doey-eyed patrons walking around in circles for a place to eat, \u00a0tray in hand with freshly cooked food, slowly going cold. Good luck to families or groups looking for a large table. At least they can tag team while one orders and another holds the table.As for the food, the pesto and arrabbiata pastas we ordered were flavoursome and cooked al dente right in front of us. You have the option of adding extra chilli and garlic to your taste. I'll give the pizzas a try the next time I need a quick lunch.",

If you are wandering along Oxford Street, right by Oxford Circus, and don't want to pay a lot but want a nice, casual Italian meal, this is the place for you. I first went in Berlin, then in New York, and now London and the standard of quality matched for all the locations. When you first go in, you are handed a card that you use at each station (pasta, pizza, appetisers, bar, etc) to order. Once you order, you touch your card to the reader and bring your food back to your table. \u00a0At the end of the meal (not really table service) you go up to the front and pay. This was particularly difficult for me because we got wine and I was having fun, and I couldn't keep track of how much money I was spending. Whoopsy. The casual but trendy atmosphere combined with the large communal tables with basil plants you can leaves from for your food makes it really comfortable and happy. It's not very expensive, but again, keeping track of how much money you spend isn't easy. But if you want pasta made to order that you can watch be prepared, it's pretty fun.",

However, there is a huge BUT. At least weird for me and my girlfriend.. With entering we were given cards and told to have anything and that we will be charged once leaving... The staff did not want to bother with explaining details. It made us feel like we are doing a questionnaire... So soon we realised the system is based on concept of buffet. In our opinion, it was not impressive at all! We felt like cheated. Yet I had supposedly fresh orange juice, which tasted like concentrated with larger quantity of sugar cubes (not much tanginess really). We left straight after that experience - it was distressing!",

As I am originally from Hamburg, Germany where Vapiano is from as well, I did not know it was there until I ran past it accidentally.Vapiano is a self-service restaurant just round the corner from Oxford Circus tube station. It's literally 3 minutes, just behind the Topshop flagship store.At Vapiano you find all kinds of pasta, pizza and salads. These are priced reasonable from around 5.75 a pizza/pasta.Drinks are a little more expensive compared to Germany but still a really good choice for a nice meal, inexpensive and still very central in London!",

I whipped up yelp and spotted this area for a lil carb load to get me through the night. The concept of Vapiano is quite interesting... Kinda an upscale cafeteria style of serving? You essentially get a card at the entrance, stand in line to order and pickup your food, you eat at community tables, then pay after you're done. The lines seemed to take a long time to get your food, that was about the only negative thing I could think about really... The food itself was well portioned and tasted amazing (perhaps hunger really is the best spice). Wash it down with a pint from the bar or a glass of vino and it's a solid meal!",

Having heard the meat is halal we were eager to try out dishes we wouldn't usually be able to have in most popular restaurants. At first when we arrived we were just handed cards and not given much of an explanation about how the buffet system works. It seemed straightforward but the cards weren't explained to us. We asked a staff member and that was when we realised that everything we order will be added to the card and then we pay at the end of our time there. Once we queued up we saw there were several queues for pasta, pizza and antipasti. We decided to go for pasta and was delighted to find we could choose from a selection of freshly made pasta. You then decide the dish you want and it is prepared right in front of you! I ordered the Chicken Alfreda with tagliatelle and my friend ordered a seafood dish with tagliatelle (can't remember the name!) and both were tasty! Only downside is even though it is a buffet it seems each dish is added to the card and you are charged for separate meals, which resembles a normal restaurant system and wouldn't suit a customer on a budget! Overall a pleasant visit and will definitely consider going again if I am anywhere near Oxford street this summer!",

    "text": "More style than substance; I have found Vapiano to be igniting people's interest via the novelty of picking your food and watching it being cooked before your very eyes, but in reality it is rather frustrating as you are left hungry and watching the food of all the people queuing in front of you being served. Testament to this was the fact that I saw people who were originally queuing up for pasta then decide it was taking too long and go to the pizza counter instead. Then guess what? They had their pizza cooked and served way before I even reached the beginning of the queue for pasta. I am left famished and disgruntled wondering whether this tactic of not being able to order whilst seated is actually a sinister ploy to save on employment costs as waiters were no longer needed. The bowls they serve the pasta in are somewhat heavy and awkward to manoeuvre, the trays provided do not have much grip or border making them also awkward to carry, meanwhile the cutlery and napkins are self-service by the cooking counter but even some of these supplies had run out when I was there.Anyhow, ridiculous setup aside, the pasta is admittedly of a good quality; noticeably fresh and satisfying to taste. The portion of pasta may initially look quite small but upon eating you soon realise that the density of the pasta makes it sufficiently filling. Unfortunately, nice as the food was, I wouldn't say that 'the end' justifies 'the means'; there just comes a point when you think to yourself this isn't worth the hassle. Self-service only works when it speeds up proceedings and gives you a sense of control but at Vapiano you relinquish this control and find yourself hungry, forced to stand in line, then needing to carry your food (and drink) with somewhat difficulty to seating that is actually not that comfortable before you can stop your stomach from grumbling, but your mind will continue to grumble afterwards about the torture you have just been through.",

Unlike other restaurants, when you enter vapiano instead of asking for a table you'll instead be handed a card which is not unlike a credit card that you are told to charge all of your orders to. This system works out very well. Every time you order something, you simply swipe the card and the amount is added to your bill. Which you then pay at the end of your visit. I had a pizza and it was great. On par with any of the other major Italian restaurant chains. The service was fast and it fasted great.

The good side of it is that you actually see your food being prepared, which can be really interesting. I do not love canteen style dining, but the atmosphere of this restaurant makes it up for it. This venue can get quiet packed though in busy times, so I suggest looking for different ones to avoid stress.

Good concept if you are paying separately, want to try various things on the menu and as a couple/group (and at peak time) not a great place to go, or concept. Loads of staff not doing much. Some staff very rude. For example, when leaving we were asked if we had a good visit, when we relayedthe above, she gave us dirty looks, and didn't apologise or try and change our perception.",

The actual serving of the food is quick.. You order the base of a dish and then can choose your choice of pasta ..For seating is fight for the first place haha it's ok in the quiet times but avoid during rush peak times..The atmosphere is very loud though so not great for a first date..again this is when it is busy the rest of the times it can be quiet..They don't rush you out of the place which is a bonus once you find your perch.. Food is flavoursome and portions are filling I usually order the Chilli Chicken with my choice of pasta, it's not too spicy and I usually have to add extra chilli oil from the table.. The portion is filling..They also have a self serving salad bar and pizza selection.The drinks options are sodas behind the food counters but they have a full bar selection at a different counter.. Average price of pasta dish \u00a36-11Depends on your budget but you'll find a meal ;)",

One of us had to man the table while everyone else went to order their food. Due to the different lines, everyone got their food at different times, which was a bit annoying as some of us were finished with the food while others were still waiting to get theirs. \u00a0I had the red pesto pasta. I originally wanted the spelt fusilli, but they were out so I got the spelt spaghetti instead. The pasta was... ok. I though it was a bit bland and wish I has asked for chills or garlic, or something else to add flavour. They skimped on the sundried tomatoes as well. For \u00a37 for a bowl of pasta I expected more. It's a neat concept, but it wouldn't be my top choice for dinner.",

After you get your card and order your food, you must get a table. The space upstairs can be equally good for small meetings (Last time I was there was with a friend that was going through a rough phase) or big parties (had a blast having dinner with a group of friends and a lot of nice cocktails). The alcohol is good and the food is definitely worth the price. Absolutely nothing bad to say about it apart from the fact that the staff should consider a better room management. Big thumbs up for the costumer service of the chefs (in spite of the cashier who was tearing people a bit like cattle).",

    "text": "Vapiano turned out to be a bit of a lifesaverMy Yelp Elite friend Lorrie M, who was visiting London from San Jose and I had planned dinner at Savoir Faire that evening to encompass the now sadly-banned-in-California foie gras. Sadly, our original plan was rudely disrupted by some pickpockets and following a visit to the police station, we wandered in search of food, a little shell-shocked at the evening's eventsWe were on our way in search of a drink when we happened upon Vapiano and although our appetites weren't at highest levels, we decided that we needed something to eatOn entering, the hostess at the door explained the concept to us - we were given cards to charge stuff at all the cooking stations around the restaurant as well as at the bar. The menu is Italian, so there were live pasta cooking chefs, a pizza oven and a section serving starters, salads and small platesLorrie chose a pizza and I went with the caprese salad which I had spotted on another customer's table. Despite our initial lack of hunger, the food actually filled a needed spot. The pizza base was crispy and generous with toppings. The caprese salad had genrous amounts of lovely creamy mozzarela, tomatoes and fresh basil that you could replenish from a basil plant at the table! A zingy balsamic dressing brought the salad ingredients to lifeAn interesting concept and it did turn out to be just what we needed to sit down and chill out after the earlier events of the evening",

Following a relaxed late-night drink at Princi last night, I had a frustrating lunch at Vapiano today. The concept seems like a good idea at first sight, but it all fails during lunchtime rush hours. The waiting time for our food was ridiculous, and I feel \u00a310 for a dish of pasta and a small water are a bit much - especially if you have to do most of the work yourself. OK, they cook the stuff, but that's about it.It feels like a canteen in a big German company, with the touch-in and touch-out Oyster style cards, just a lot less efficient. Not impressed.",

You scan a card with your order and pay at the end. Simple!And tasty. For \u00a38-10 you get freshly cooked pasta with decent sauces, or pizza with freshly made dough. Sometimes I think they need to inject a bit more flavour into the sauces, but then I add some herbs that are fresh on every table as a garnish and sprinkle some chilli oil over the top and it makes it all come alive. For those need a sophisticated quick bite, you can't really complain.",

The cook made my pasta perfectly and asked if I wanted garlic and chilis and confirmed the quantity. \u00a0It was perfect! A few days later we decided to come back for another visit to make sure we got our Vapiano fill before we departed. \u00a0This time we were there around 10pm. \u00a0The line wasn't as long but took much longer to get waited on. \u00a0When I told the cook what we wanted he just asked what kind of pasta, there were only 3 types left so we chose campanelle. \u00a0We did not get asked about garlic and chili so we asked the cook and he said he'd already put it in. \u00a0We also asked about the parsley on top and he said they were out. \u00a0He had cooked it much faster then it's taken previous times. \u00a0We had ordered it To-Go since it was late. \u00a0We looked at our food and saw no chilis. \u00a0We brought this to the manager's attention when we were paying and he just said \"Oh\" and didn't care, just asked for payment. \u00a0When we got back to our hotel to eat, the sauce was watery and not flavorful. \u00a0There was also no garlic taste or chilis. \u00a0It was very disappointing and ruined the Vapiano experience for me. \u00a0No such thing as great customer service here. \u00a0They didn't care that their cook provided awful service and sub-par food. \u00a0Had it not been for the last trip there this would have definitely been a 4 or 5 star rating.",

It's unfair to queue up for an hour if you get a slow cook, than for those who arrived 30 mins later than you, but get \u00a0served before you. This queuing system benefits the restaurant as they don't need to hire too many waitresses, but I, as a customer, have to queue for at least 60+ mins for food. Please, just hire waitress to serve food.",

    "text": "I went there with friends after a very exhausting 10K run to re-carb.The place runs in a unique way. Think about it as dine in but being on a street food market. Basically, you are given a card that will be charged with anything you order (you pay at the exit to the cashier). You try to find a table, then you wander around and pick what you want.The really great thing is you can see your food being prepared. I am a real sucker for this so I was in heaven. The cook is talking to you asking if you want specific spices in like garlic chillies and how much you want. That was excellent. Feel like on street market. Eat like in a good restaurant. Fantastic!Right, there are two main sections: pastas and pizzas. There are multiple parallel queues for those and having good strategy means saving possibly half an hour of your time. Pizzas take longer to make so order them first. You will get a buzzer to pick them up when they are ready. In the meantime head over to pasta section and get them to your table.As you may already noticed the service is nonexistent, you have to do everything yourself. There are people picking up the empty plates for you. But you don't pay service charge or tip.The food quality is ok. I wouldn't say it's the best that I've eaten but the portions are really satisfying. In particular, pasta was prepared very very quickly. The cook was preparing it in some kind of a wok mixing and stirring ingredients vigorously. It was Italian stir fry essentially. One of my friends loved it. I had a bit of reservations to this food preparation technique. We had pizza calzone as well. The dough was quite nice. The spicy sausages were also stellar. Overall pretty good spot!I definitely recommend it to runners!",

Not a good call for the solo diner!This cruise ship style dining is perfect for those wanting a little more free reign almost, and seeing it cooked or prepared in front of you.You get given a credit style card upon entry and swipe your card at each order point to rack up your tab.I ordered bruschetta and whilst it was being prepared I placed an order for a calzone pizza and was given a pager for when that would be ready. \u00a0 I also took a drink from the antipasti station where they promptly swiped my card!After I had eaten the starter my pager went off and off I popped (leaving my jacket on my stool with a group of 4 girls on my same bench table). \u00a0I returned to find my jacket still there and my messy side of the table untouched too! \u00a0My calzone was not the best ever choice, as I felt it had not been in the oven long enough and the cheese was barely melted and the pizza base only lightly cooked.

There's a large seating area but you can also take away if you prefer. The only drawback for me (but supposedly great for them) is that the place is always packed. Therefore you never really get the chance to eat together. Whether I came in with a friend or with a group, I never actually had a chance to eat all at the same time. You can wait for ages if you don't come right before or after lunch timewhich kind of defeats the purpose of having lunch, right? Besides, don't go there if on a low budget and just want a lunch break, \u00a38.10 for a pizza or pasta, a bit dear.

Well Vapiano offers Italian, fresh food, and fast.I discovered only later that this is a chain as well, but the first branch in London. I would not go there for a candle light dinner but for lunch the place is great. The idea is that you do it all by your self ( except cooking the food). You get this chip card and you choose what you want to eat and in every food station has machine you that records the price. Oh well, it really is not that complicated and once you have done it the first time, you will know the game.The best part is that the chefs prepare the food in front of you. You get to say exactly how much chili you want etc. It is wicked! And the food, pasta, pizza, salads, antipasto, is great with great prices (mains up to \u00a38.50) if you keep on mind the Oxford Circus location.We visited the place with my work colleagues and it was great when we did not have to go through all that splitting the bill operation.",

It was really quite busy when we dropped by, considering it was a Thursday evening (not the type of place I imagine people hanging out but clearly I was wrong).

Doesn't matter, I will tell you anyway.The restaurant is, to start with, different. As opposed to Carluccios or Strada, in these floor there is room to spare. as soon as I came in The first thing that caught my eye was that in every single table you have got a nice little rosemary and basil plant.cooks dish out your stuff in front of you, organized in various queues for pasta, for pizza and for saladsAs you may figure out I ate until I dropped. So did my friends. I ordered a orange-twisted pasta, and it did the job for me. Perhaps i have been slighlty put-off by the measuring obsession and the gloves the chefs used that reminds me a fast-food chain, all contributing to an artificial feeling. nevermind. I'm sure if they did not use gloves some fussy dry-capuccinos lady would complain as if in standards kitchens cook worn plastic gloves.Pizza wasn't that kick-asses. Rather bland, but i appreciated the thinness of the base. I also got to try my friend's stuff, and I have to say the Caesar salad was off the hook. desserts were nice but not great. they were served in little airtight containers that clicked on me.prices are reasonable, although as I said i did not pay for the food.upside: space, decor, see your food being cooked, daring recipesdownside: slow unexperienced cooks,",

Having said that it does allow for cooked-on-the-spot pasta and pizza, and my first experience of the latter was positive; a properly crispy and tangy 4 cheese affair. That and a decent mixed side salad (obtained from a different queue)made it a good lunchtime spot. Good value for money as well (maybe the efficiency thing does work for them).",

The salads are just nice. I love that you have the full choice of what you want in your salad, which dressing, which bread etc. The pasta is nice as well! I love the wholegrain pasta the most! If you haven't tried it yet - give it a shot! The selection of pasta is very nice as well.. There are some spicy, some vegetarian and of course the classics like bolognese or carbonara. The pizza is delicios as well. I don't like the fat american pizza. So I love the thin crispy pizza's of Vapianos. Their wine is nice as well.. There is one white wine called ...Cattarano (sorry dont remember the whole name). It's not only cheap but delicious as well! Remember you can buy full bottles for take-away as well! The service and waiting times are very good and therefore there is almost nothing I could complain about Only thing is that compared to Vapiano's in Germany their indoor's don't look as nice. It's still nicely decorated, but the one's in Germany are just even more beautiful :P I also miss a larger outdoor area!",

    "text": "Vapiano was a hideous dining experience, reminded me of all inclusive buffet on holiday or worse the school canteen! The concept is to pick and collect your own food and drink but in a more trendy setting than eating in the restaurant within Debenhams and then pay at the end with a swipe card.You go in, find a nice table and then have to get up and queue for your food, holding onto your coat and bag (coz this is central London), if as in my case you decide to eat Pizza and your friend goes for Pasta you join 2 seperate queues, wait a ridiculous amount of time considering this is supposed to be a convenient/efficient restaurant and then queue again for a drink. You may then find that one of you has your food and drink ready to return to the table and eat while the other is given a pager to wait for their food to be brought over by a waitress. So one of you eats their meal (as you have no way of knowing how long the food will be and no staff to moan to about the delay) and then has to wait for the other to be served and eat theirs.The whole point of this place is it is self service and by paying at the end so you are not delaying starting eating. Perhaps the business plan was that people would buy lots of food and drink without realising how much the cost was, hat would be true if you didn't have to leave your table, posessions and friends to order each time.I would only eat in a Vapiano again if I was alone in a foreign country and on a real budget. The people that have reviewed this place thus far seem to have done so based purely on price, if you think this is worthy of 4 stars try Nandos you'll be blown away!",

It serves a standard variety of pizza, pasta and salad dishes. Speaking of the quality, the pizza was made of fresh ingredients and baked in the proper oven, but generally tasted fairly plain. There wasn't anything particularly special about most other dishes we had either. The unique ordering system where you have to order at the counter, then you are called back to pick it up and then pay at the exit, may help to save five minutes if you're in a hurry, but personally I prefer restaurants with normal service arrangements so that I have an option to leave a tip. The impression from this restaurant I was left with was overall pretty average. This place is ok for lunch if you happen to be in that area, but I wouldn't come here often otherwise.",
