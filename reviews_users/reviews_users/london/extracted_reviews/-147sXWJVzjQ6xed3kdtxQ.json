Turns out he only knew the owner as he had been a regular there for years. Must be good, I thought and BOY.. couldn't have been more right! I love this place. The food is literally made in front of your eyes in an open kitchen by the chef who mumbles to himself / sings to himself. Real italian food cooked in the big fire ovens, served by crazy Italian family at a superb price of around \u00a37 for a main. And HUGE. As in the titanic of pizzas. And smothered in a real home made fresh Italian tomato sauce. Also offer amazing chilli oil to spice it all up a bit too. AND if you're lucky, and the owner is in a particularly friendly mood... free limoncello at the end of the meal! The outside seating / window tables also offer the best view of the London Street Television and the classic mixture of Soho characters. Could the London Italian life get any better?",

Almost got up and left but decided to persevere mainly because of great reviews I read. Wish I'd got up and left now. Ordered bruschetta followed by spaghetti vongole thinking bruschetta would be nice fresh starter before main. \u00a0Unfortunately bruschetta was far too salty and far too oily and came with limp salad which I left. Not nice. Fingers crossed for the main, which turned out to be better although I had to fish out a dozen thick slices of garlic, which may have been to some tastes but not mine. \u00a0Look, I'm no expert, but this is basic fare, not much more. I would expect any half decent restaurant to serve up food better than I could make, but I can honestly say that I could do better. Wish I'd had pizza, which looked good. I live in Sale, a small town south of Manchester and we have at least 4 Italian restaurants that are better than this. This place is OK but not great. Also, and this isn't Porchetta's fault, I had to endure a shrieking imbecile sat near me for the duration of my meal. \u00a0All in all not the best dining experience I've ever had. Having said all that, just got the bill and it was very cheap.",

Quite oily food. Pizzas not as good as Pizza Express or Zizi, but they are cheaper by a couple of pounds. (Best pizza in London is possibly Pizza East in either Shoreditch, Portobello Road or Kentish Town). Bottled beer was served ice cold. Chairs had no lumber support. No atmosphere, very very brightly lit and low-rent feel to fixtures, fittings and decoration. Tables were low, cramped, with an unusual, giant base meaning there was nowhere for taller people (e.g. 6 foot) to put their feet and knees. Bill for starter, main (pizza) and two drinks each was \u00a319 per person including 10% service charge. Personally, I'd rather spend a little more and have a more comfortable, tasty experience. \u00a0I'll not be returning.",

With an abundance of deliciously simply destined options, my friend and I finally settled on pizza (as it looked and smelled too good to pass up) and red table wine (as the bottle price- just under 15 pounds- was too good to pass up!). While we waited for our pizza, we sipped our wine (nothing spectacular, but very satisfying and comfortable) while enjoying the busy, familial atmosphere of the restaurant. Though distracted and hard-worked, the staff was very polite and brought water quickly when we managed to get their attention between running plates of pasta and pizza to their happy, hungry clientele. When our pies were brought out, they did not disappoint; I myself happily tucked into a broccoli and sausage pizza, which managed to balance the toppings, sauce, and cheese impeccably. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her mushroom pizza. The crust, a crunchy woodfired style, was a sturdy and delicious vehicle for fresh ingredients. A friendly, well-run, fairly-priced, and (most importantly!) tasty establishment, I highly recommend :)",

Home made fresh pasta. Sold! Big juicy prawns and muscles. Sold! (I had the marinara btw). And who needs pizza express when you can get pizza from this joint. Mama Mia! Portions are big and it's tasty too. It's faff free food and so are the prices. Staff are friendly and very Italiano. Won't be long till I go back there and say Ciao Bella! ( corny but cool!!!)",

    "text": "The outside of the building doesn't look like much - but it's definitely worth going in! A nice italian restaurant with ridiculously affordable prices for the location. A glass of wine is about \u00a32.50 and pizza and calzones (which are quite large portions) range from \u00a36-7.50! The food is good and I enjoy going here for the occasional lunch or dinner. My husband has an insane metabolism and a huge appetite so this is perfect for us. So far I've tried the tortelloni and the penne gorgonzola. Both were good - but next time I want to try the calzone. My husband had it last time and it was delicious. Service is a little slow - but as an American in Britain, I find the service overall to be held to a higher standard in the US so perhaps that's where my bias comes from. In any case, check them out!",

    "text": "Its a miss this time! This one is passable.The reviews I read on Yelp did not connect with the experience we had at La Porchetta. I ordered a calzone which was portioned quite large but disappointingly average. The dough was tasteless while the stuffing was mediocre. My husband on the other had the calamari with tomato sauce on a bread. I tasted his food and it was a bit on a spicy side while the sauce lack the flavour. Also, the squid was not so fresh and the the bread was questionable as it became so soggy from the sauce. \u00a0After consuming my food, I was thinking of giving this place 2 stars for the friendly staff and service they provided. However, my husband noticed that the guy making the dough for pizzas and calzones walked in from the outside of the restaurant, returned back to his work station (which happens to be next to our seat) but did not wash his hands! EEkkkkkkkk!!! Perhaps it is not such a good idea to have food preparers/chefs prepare and or entertain the clients at the same time.Overall, I certainly had a much better Italian food elsewhere for even lesser price but good quality.",

My wife and her sister weren't able to finish their pastas so they had asked for a box. I guess the restaurant packs it up for you because the waitress took their plates to put everything in a take away box. Unfortunately, as the waitress walked away the from table, I noticed one the forks falls from the plate to the ground. Some guy with a man bun behind the register picks it up and puts it back on the plate. I see the waitress mouth something to him and he makes a face and they both laugh at one another. I was giving them the benefit of the doubt, to own up on the situation, but nope, the waitress came back with the take away boxes. No \"sorry we had a mishap and can't give you the take away box\" ...nothing. Let's just pack contaminated food and give it back to the customer. \u00a0Could've been a one time thing but who knows??? If that's how they handle those types of situations, then maybe they're relaxed on how they handle their food to begin with. Major turnoff!",

Just like a 'Lidl' advert you are surprised by how cheap the bill is in regards to how great the food tasted and you will definitely come back for more!! I love Italian, and on a night out I love to save some pennies. This place hasn't marked all of it's prices up just cause it is in the heart of Soho, London. Neither has it scrimped on it's ingredients. If I am being completely honest I started going here as it was a cheap way to line my stomach before a night out (come on we can all admit we have done that), but now I come here cause the food is just so good. I always lean towards the pizza (Fiorentina.. I know, Egg on a pizza!!) and never get food envy. It's my go to place and my friends never complain.P.S GET THE \u00a35 Aperol Spritz they are amazing!!",

When we arrived, it looked like a cute, homey restaurant. However, we were quickly ushered downstairs, which didn't have any of the charm of upstairs. It looked like a windowless cafe, very plain. The menu was huge, with all the staples you would expect from an Italian restaurant. It took us a long time to get the waitress's attention, and she was surly with us. Our food took at least an hour to arrive. During that time, we saw a table of about twelve young men get their pizzas every ten minutes or so. Some of them had finished eating before others had received their food. We also saw two women with a young girl tell the waitress that they had been waiting for their food for a long time, and that they had theater tickets to get to. A couple came in after us (and after the women with theater tickets), and received their food first, at which point the women gave up, told the waitress that the wait had been ridiculous, and left. At this, the waitresses rolled their eyes and chatted/gossiped with each other. The food left a lot to be desired. My pasta was alright, but my boyfriend's pizza was undercooked and raw in the middle. Overall, do yourself a favor and go to any of the other amazing restaurants London has to offer.",

The penne arrabbiata here is just like it is in Rome, seriously... the best pasta I have had outside Italy. I was shocked! We also tried the pizza, which was good, but not excellent & the caprese salad wasn't terribly authentic but the penne overshadowed everything and now I am a huge fan of this place. The location and interior of the cafe does not do the food justice. It reminds me of an American Italian diner that serves overcooked mushy pasta. Needless to say I'm glad this wasn't the case. The price is also spot on and the service was quick and friendly.I highly suggest checking it out!",

The menu is great- they have about 30 pasta dishes and almost all of them are under \u00a38. I've only had the penne amatriciana and the spaghetti bolognese but both we're delicious and for once I was glad that the portions were HUGE! I ate half at the restaurant then took half to the hotel.

I noticed that most of the people in the restaurant ordered a pizza but I was craving pasta, so I went for that instead. I ordered the penne with amatriciana sauce and it came out perfectly. The sauce was tangy with a meaty flavor, and the pasta was tender but not overcooked. The portion was huge. I came in with quite an appetite and still left at least a quarter of the plate untouched. Service was pretty so-so but I'm sure if I had a problem, it would have been easy to get a server's attention.

    "text": "Went on a Saturday night, was a bit skeptical but luckily didn't have to wait too long for a table. Once seated, we ordered and the food arrived fairly quickly. The food was as good as i expected after reading a few reviews. Tried both the pasta and the pizza and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was amazing, and so was the interior decor, very similar to the family run restaurants you find in Italy. The best bit was the prices, every pizza and pasta dish is under \u00a39 I believe, so can't complain. Might have to be a regular for Italian food.",

This is great comfort food at a bargain price, and while it may not blow you away, you will leave very happy with change in your pocket.",
