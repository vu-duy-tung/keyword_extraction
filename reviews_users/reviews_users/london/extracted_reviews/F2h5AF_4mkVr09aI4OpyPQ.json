    "text": "Had a voucher and wanted to check out at least one Indian restaurant while in London. This one was just up the street from the hotel so it was perfectly convenient. The restaurant is bright and colourful and really inviting. The service was very friendly and helpful. My mom had a prawn curry and I had a vegetarian Thali. I rarely get platters because I usually don't want to try everything in it but this one just looked and smelled amazing. I tried a little bit of everything and it was all fantastic. For a chain, I have to say, this was way better than any of the places here in Vegas. The prices were extremely reasonable; especially considering how much food we were served. I will be back next time I'm in London.",

    "text": "This latest branch of Masala Zone doesn't officially open until the end of the week, but locals have been drawn in by the promise of very generous pre-launch offers. Just got back from a half price meal with a friend. We were lucky to have got a table as availability was very limited and people had to be turned away.The food is as excellent as at the other outlets I have sampled. This is serious competition to long-established Khan's just down the road.Not quite convinced by the Bollywood decor, but this may be mainly due to the fact that most of the panels were being ripped off the walls while we were eating. The interior designer must have had a bit of a tantrum when he saw the artwork put up in all the wrong places \u00a0I think they need to get the plasterers back in. Unusual dinner entertainment.Most of the staff were still in training but our waitress was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.I look forward to coming back when they are in full swing.",

It's so good that you have to open another location, then another, and another...all of a sudden you're a local chain. Maybe people start to think that the food is bad, because of the \"chain\" affiliation; but they're wrong! Not 'dead wrong' (it's not that serious), but they're missing out. I absolutely love the Lunch Thali's; they really hit the mark on being the perfect amount of food. Satisfying, but not heavy or greasy. Also, the Dali Puri. Holy Sh*t. This appetizer is all kinds of awesome and I'm always tempted to make it my whole meal. The way the flavors and textures go together is just perfect. I can only attest to this location, but the staff are WONDERFUL. So nice and genuine. The decor is vibrant and playful. They also have a lower seating area that seems like it would be good for kids...In conclusion:Staff 5+Food 5+Introducing me to Dali Puri (infinity points)+Lunch Thali's 5+Decor 5Location 5Cocktails! 5",

Being Indian, I rarely expect amazing things from Indian take aways or restaurants, but I do expect the food to be enjoyable to an extent and satisfactory. The salad was wilted and drenched in dressing. We had a couple of grand thalis, one meat and the other chicken. Although I'd asked for my order to be very very hot, i could barely taste the chillis and the overall taste of the food was near unpleasant. More and more I'm convinced that decent Indian restaurant food exists only in the north and midlands (Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham and Leicester).",

A huge metal tray covered with smaller metal dishes of food, all well balanced in flavour, and they change each time you go there. You also get a good helping of rice in the middle of the tray, chappati, masala poppadom, chutneys, yoghurt, and of course the main curry that you choose from the menu. Definitely recommended. The colourful 'firework box' decor, and other Indian kitsch signs make a wonderful backdrop for some delicious food. I have been there with a group of people born and brought up in India, and they loved it too. It's only a matter of time before I go again!",

In all seriousness, this place really surprised me - you walk in and immediately recognize it as an upscale chain restaurant. This isn't a bad thing - you know they have processes in place that are make for a consistently good meal. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and seated in a comfortable table near the window. The waitress handed me a menu and also a pictorial menu of some of their most popular dishes. She patiently explained the Thali, which is a stainless steel platter with little bowls of various dishes - lentils, potatoes, or curry - that can be ordered in two sized. I had the Grand Thali and chose the lamb rogan josh as my curry. What a treat - the side dishes change regularly I'm told, so each night could be a different adventure that makes going back several times more fun. I would also pair the meal with the Meantime London Lager. It's a light beer with real flavor that compliments the spiciness of the meal perfectly.",

I've now been there several times and will continue to eat here, as it is lovely!First thing to mention are the supremely chilled out staff. Every request I've ever had, they've accommodated. Every member of staff I've encountered has been lovely and relaxed. Service is very quick, too.Second thing to mention is the selection. If you're a vegetarian, this is heaven! I hesitated to go for a long time because they don't post menus on t heir site, but have faith! There are great vegetarian choices, but it's perfectly suitable for a meat-eater as well!Third thing is that the food is -lovely-. It's delicate but robust, varied but consistent, and just orgasmically delicious. I always get the grand thali (almost like a pick n mix curry type of thing) but to be honest it's more than I can humanly eat. I've had some of the little appetizers and enjoyed them a lot too. The prices are fair, I'd even say quite good. When husband and I go, we each have dinner and a drink or two and it's usually around \u00a330. \u00a0All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!

They include the tip on the bill which was fine with me because I was going to tip higher than the % they charge. I'd come again. Almost 18 pounds total. Had to ask for the bill, my only tiny complaint.",

    "text": "You probably look into this place and cast judgement, as I did, at the tables all arranged neatly in a big open space and scoff at the naff decor. You conclude that in its unashamed chain-outlet resplendence, in the centre of the gastronomic wasteland near Queensway, that it is the nightmare offspring of a bad curry house and a Pizza Hut and should therefore be avoided like the plague. As I did. To do so is to miss out on a real treat. The food is different, a fresh twist on Indian and really very good indeed. We had a mouthwatering starter of chickpeas in tamarind - an explosion of flavour, sometimes savoury, sometimes spicy, with dashes of some crazy lime pickleness running through it. Onto the main, two different vegetable thalis. Mine had banana and lotus root as a main with three delicious mini-bowls of loveliness. Potatoes with cashew sauce...okra...apparently the sides change daily. I got ambitious with my second drink and ordered the \"Masala Coke\" - a best-avoided SAVOURY spicy coke which despite my usual sense of adventure just didn't work. I didn't say anything, but the waiter was blessed with telepathy and asked if I liked it and would change it if not...how unusual is that?I'd love to dock a star for the decor but the meal and experience was that good I just can't. \u00a0Give it a go. The food alone is something else and streets ahead of 99% of all the Indian restaurants I've dined at. Yum.",

The menu isn't huge but has the awesome Thali along with a choice of 8ish curries, some sharing starters and biryanis.My friend and I both went for a Thali, which for \u00a314 max includes a 4oz curry, 2 vegetable sides, a lentil side, 2 chapatis or rice, a popadom and chutneys. I love Thalis! It means you get to try lots of different dishes but without ordering crazy amounts of food. The lamb rogan josh was good (spicy, full of flavour), the potato curry was ok but my favourite was the broccoli curry which was delicious! The lentil curry was a bit watery and bland and the chapatis a little cold but everything else was piping hot and all the food was good except the chapatis. What made it a lovely meal out apaaaart from the feast of delicious food was the service. The waitress was so friendly, happy and attentive (continually filling up my water - I'm not so good with spice!). You are able to reserve tables which in this day and age in central London is a miracle and they also do takeaway - pick up or delivery through some of the apps. This is also a bit cheaper than the eat in menu along with no tip! I've been looking for a good Indian takeaway in my area for so long and now I've found it - gone are the days of watery or oily Friday night 'curries'!",

Entree: We ordered a vegetable dish (Undhiyo & Lentil Khichdi) and a lamb dish (Dhaaba Roghan Josh)Overall, portion size to price is a little above average price but worth a visit for the food.
