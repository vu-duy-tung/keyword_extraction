    "text": "Had I written this review before my last visit to Tierra Brindisa it would have certainly got the full five stars, but while the food was still faultless and delicious my recent trip proved that the credit crunch is hurting a major part of the restaurant experience: the atmosphere. We went on a Saturday night, and a few months ago this restaurant would have been packed to the rafters and buzzing with chat, but there were only two tables taken and we were the only customers at the bar. The staff were all standing around looking very bored and it was all a bit too quiet, not what you're looking for in a tapas place. But aside from that I really can't fault Tierra Brindisa; everything on the menu sounds and tastes fantastic, from the gooey tortilla to the melt in the mouth steak and cheese on toast, all the way to the desserts like melted white chocolate on toast, and fruit salad with olive oil and mint. There are daily specials which are equally good and top quality, the wines and sherries are delicious and the coffee is great. If it weren't for the tumbleweed blowing through the place it would be full marks here.",

The food is delicious and it's difficult deciding what to order because everything on the menu looks fantastic. I recommend the pan fried sea bass with vegeatbles, olive oil mash and the prawns with garlic and chilli. If it's your first time eating \u00a0tapas the staff are more than willing to explain the dishes. Not only is the food great but there is an excellent wine list although it is quite expenive and many are only available by the bottle.",

    "text": "Part of the growing Brindisa empire, Tierra Brindisa in Soho takes things to a new level. You can book, which you can't for other tapas bars in this small chain. Brindisa (a small Spanish importer with a sideline in tapas bars) specialises in fresh, traditional and lesser known Spanish foods and wines. The results are tremendous. We had some of the following - olives stuffed with orange and dressed with pepper and crushed clove; carpaccio of cod with red onion and orange; spinach with pine nuts and raisins; potato omellette; scallop with garlic, chilli, smoked paprika and bacon. I'm sure there was more. Oh yes, marvellously mellow Rioja. Each dish was faultless. The service was flawless. The decor was without fault. Everything was lovely. Disabled access to the restaurant is available but as I recall, the loos are downstairs so not entirely practical from that POV. From my experience though, 5 stars for food, service and decor.",

    "text": "If half stars were allowed, I'd add one to my review for this place. To start with, the food was quite good, but our visit started off on the wrong foot. I arrived early for once, and grabbed prime seating by the window. My other friends joined shortly and one of the guys went to the men's room to wash his hands while the rest of us perused the menu. He came back, a bit disturbed, and quickly grabbed the attention of a waitress. Apparently, one of the cooks in the kitchen had rushed out of the toilet when he entered, and proceeded to exit without washing his hands! The hostess rushed back to talk to the chefs, then returned to reassure us that he had subsequently washed his hands, but it was a bit of a disturbing start to the evening. Once food and wine were ordered, however, the experience only got better. The potato omelette, as mentioned previously, is well worth a try. The octopus and the gambas were also of note -- though the servings were a bit on the small side (there were exactly 4 prawns). Dessert was a definite highlight, consisting of a near perfect molten chocolate cake, but by that point the wine probably took over the taste buds. Overall a pretty good experience, but I'd be a bit concerned if their sanitary habits weren't improved...",

Interesting wine list, and dessert options which could have easily been explored further had we been able to attract the attention of either of the two waitresses standing not five feet away. I did manage to make eye contact several times but as a paying customer I didn't seem to rate much of a mention in comparison to a detailed discussion regarding the relative merits of various rental properties in London's Soho. \u00a0We went very early on a Saturday night and the restaurant was only about a 3rd full - maybe the staff work best under pressure and hence the other reviews? To add final insult, a 12.5% 'discretionary' tip was automatically added to the bill, which we literally had to stand up and make as if to walk out to receive. \u00a0To his credit, the manager asked what went wrong and then apologized profusely for the shortcomings - but only after our discretion was employed re the tip. Unfortunately this all occurred in front of one of the staff members - resulting in a rather frosty farewell. I'd recommend considering using your discretion and steering clear.",

The potato omelette was unlike anything we've ever had before it makes the standard stuff at other Spanish places seem like cardboard! The chorizo in cider was really delicious, the meat just melting in your mouth. But the highlight was the honey glazed fillet wrapped in aubergine. The meat was so tender and juicy, and the mango chutney that came with it was tantalizingly spicy. The only thing that disappointed was the toast with olive oil, which was rather burnt. We were surprised they got that wrong as its such a simple thing compared to the culinary delicacies we'd just eaten! Bill came up to around \u00a345 for 2 with non-alcoholic drinks, a tad bit pricey but you do get good tapas!",

The back area has loads of skylights and an open kitchen so you know you're getting good clean food. We had a group of 8 people for lunch which was the perfect number. We were able to try all sorts of dishes... just small tastes. Although, I could have eaten my very own portion of the honey glazed goats cheese and the warm spinach salad. But I suppose that would defeat the idea of tapas. We started with breads, dipping oils, cold meats, cheeses, peppers and corn nuts, then moved on to Spanish omelets, chicken croquettes, prawns, scallops, salads and more cheese. We finished with an assortment of desserts; the flan, the moist chocolate cake and the plum compote were to die for. I'm a very picky dessert person so it's quite impressive for me to find three desserts that I really like, all in one place! All of this was accompanied by a lot of drink. We started with champagne, moved on to white and finished with a fantastic dessert wine. The pairings were perfect for the meal. I'm dying to go back already we only left the restaurant a mere 20 hours ago.",

    "text": "I had a blind date meeting the lovely Skinny Bib for the first time at Tapas Brindisa. (Look at the Skinny Bib's excellent write up here, I almost have nothing to add!) Unfortunately the food was not as pleasant as the company. Tapas Brindisa in Soho has just opened a couple of weeks ago (there was 'Tierra Brindisa' before) and we went in the soft opening period with 20% off the food. Its older brother on the corner of Borough Market has been around what seems like forever and is always completely packed. I ate there once and was not as blown away by the food as many others. Mind you, Spanish is not my favourite cuisine and so I might need a little bit more then just 'good' to convince me. Convinced I was not by new Tapas Brindisa. But let's start with the some positive notes. I did love the space of the Soho joint which is bright with rustic wood furniture and direct view of the kitchen. We went on a sunny day and the room was bathed in beautiful light. But now the food. For me the highlight of the meal was the the Pan de Coca (3.50), basically pan con tomate which I couldn't get enough of on my holiday in Catalonia. Toasted country bread is rubbed with garlic and ripe tomato and drizzled with olive oil. Yum! But in the end it's just bread and doesn't require a huge amount of cooking skill. I rather liked the Padron Peppers (3.50). Apart from the amazing colour, they were nicely seasoned and non-greasy. An excellent bar snack. I am glad my dinner companion insisted on the Iberico de Bellota Ham (22) which was lean and beautifully flavoured. Not cheap though! I am not a ham expert at all so I can't judge if it REALLY was worth 22 pounds. I kind of doubt it though. The meal went downwards with the cooked dishes. We only tried a couple of them as the waitress pointed out that they recommend only 4-5 dishes per two people. I liked this actually as one tends to over-order in small plate restaurants but on the other hand we ended up with a maybe slightly imbalanced selection of dishes. The Traditional Potato Tortilla (4.50) was tremendously bland and of soggy consistency. We didn't like it at all. Even worse the Escalivada (5.50) which was one of the least attractive dishes I have seen in a long time. I easily forgive bad presentation if the food is good which was not the case here. The aubergines and red peppers were tasteless and drowned in olive oil. Don't get me wrong, I love olive oil, but enough is enough! Pan de Coca (3.50)Padron Peppers (3.50)Iberico de Bellota Ham (22)Traditional Potato Tortilla (4.50)Escalivada (5.50) One problem we had when ordering was that the menu is really confusing and difficult to navigate. There are 'Tapas, Brindisa Classics and Parrilla Soho as subheading. The dishes in each category all seemed to be tapas? As I say confusing. I do prefer the way it's done for example at the Opera Tavern where you have Meat, Fish and Vegetarian Tapas subheadings which enables you to order a balanced selection of dishes without having to study the menu for hours. I am sure Tapas Brindisa is going to do well in the current small plate hype but I think you can do much better than that. I got a strong recommendation for Barrafina (which I never managed to go to because I don't like queuing) and the new tapas place (Jose Tapas) in Bermondsey Street. Maybe these will finally convince me of the brilliance of the Spanish cuisine. I shall keep you posted. here some pictureshungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026",

Beef stripes were heavenly, soft like well-cooked squid. Padron peppers are a staple, but do not fail to entice - that lovely mix of sweetness, spiciness, and saltiness; a green manifest of Umami. A leg of rabbit was tender, juicy, indecently so. We had red wine, and we had sweet wine for puds. Some had sherry before the affair had started. Choc puds made chatty girls tight-lipped and hoggish. Somehow I didn't mind. I was still licking my lips from the peppers.",

    "text": "Having walked past this place a million and one times I had hopes of Tierra Brindisa. I'd read enough reviews by others to know that the back half with the bar was the best place to eat. And my forerunners were right; the airy second half of the room was a pleasurable light environment.We'd had no plans to dine out and as such hadn't thought of reservations, luckily it was relatively early and we were found a table for 3.The waitress who greeted us at the door was charming and accommodating, this trend continued throughout our meal. They smiled at our poor jokes, frequently cleared the tables and re-filled our glasses.To the dismay/confusion of my fellow diners I had already decided that choosing a wine would be easy. My theory that a good mid range European restaurant should have a quaffable fruity red under \u00a320, perfect with tapas was met with a great house red (Tempranillo) at \u00a316.50 (?).We opted for the staples of toast with tomato (what I've always known as Pan Tomaquet), and Potatoes with Aioli (not dissimilar to Patatas Bravas) for some starch to absorb the worryingly drinkable wine. They were both tasty well executed versions of their Spanish counterparts. We mulled over the cheeseboard, and having seen a few passed decided that it was quite possibly too much cheese for this occasion. Though having missed out, will mean that I'll inevitably have to go back.We opted for the deep fried goats cheese with honey and beetroot to ensure dairy received a mention. It was a beautiful combination of sweet/tart and creamy/crisp, and should rightfully spawn many a dinner party interpretation. We attempted to order the scallops from the specials, but were dutifully unformed that they had run out(read: some greedy person in front of us had eaten them all).All up we'd spent about \u00a330's each had 2/3rd's of a bottle of wine and more food than you need in a day. Lovely service and great atmosphere, all in all a winning combination...9/10",

    "text": "Friday night kicked off with a couple of pints of Landlord in the Feathers pub opposite St James tube as I waited with my old pals Kailesh and Mr Murphy for B to join us, and then it was off to Broadwick Street in Soho for a bit of food and a catch up at Tierra Brindisa. This branch of the growing Brindisa empire got our vote as it's nice and central but, more crucially when you are an eight strong party, you can book in advance. It has quite a different vibe from the London Bridge branch but that's no bad thing and in many ways it's a better choice if you want to spend the whole evening just drinking and chatting. We had bumped into another pal at the Feathers, the Hodge, and he was keen to join us so B gave them a call to see if they could accommodate another lover of fine tapas. Their advice that we could try to squeeze him onto our table at our own risk proved to be well founded when we arrived and surveyed the scene. However, we will no doubt be back with the Hodge in tow on another occasion. The restaurant has two two rooms, the larger of which is at the front with a smaller space out back with stools clustered around the bar for couples or solitary diners. The decor is all very neutral and simple, the lighting is well thought out and the furnishings are tasteful without being obtrusive. The focus here is on the food, providing a great setting for romance and/or conversation. Knowing our other guests only too well we ordered up some of the fragrant, floral \"house\" white along with some of the wonderful orange stuffed olives and alioli with quince paste, to supplement the \"gratis\" variety of nuts provided on our arrival, to stave off the hunger pangs and keep us in a cheery mood. As predicted some time around 8pm Maria and Priya arrived, with J and Julie Johnson rocking up shortly after, only a paltry 30 minutes late (some kind of record there J as my money was on 9pm!!) and we were good to go. The wine had been flowing pretty constantly since the moment we arrived so my recollection begins to get a bit hazy but we followed our normal plan of action at Brindisa and it's one that has served us well on many visits. We had an initial run at the menu ordering probably a dish each with a few orders of the tomato bread on top to start with; mainly focusing on the seafood and tortilla offerings. A second pass at the menu got a bit more messy but involved plenty of meat, yet more seafood and some vegetables and salad. J was in control of the wine by this stage and I vaguely recollect a fine bottle of Rioja. Stand-out dishes were plentiful but a special mention must be made of the divine little scallops with tiny rashers of bacon and minute new potatoes, the sardines which put me in mind of many wonderful meals in my spiritual home of Tavira, the pork fillet with sage, morcilla and roasted apple, the perfectly cooked lamb and a truely tasty version of the classic mushrooms on toast. In fact every dish was pretty much perfect other than the mussels which were a bit on the large side with a rubbery texture, just not the fresh and juicy specimens we have come to expect at Brindisa. However, that one complaint aside this was yet again another fine dining experience and it's a restaurant I would not hesitate to recommend. A crisp palate cleansing mango sorbet topped off with a candle was a lovely touch from the ever thoughtful Priya. A divine PX Valdespino sherry bursting with the flavour of raisins, with a whiff of sunnier climates, was followed by a quick espresso as we said a fond adieu to the guys and rushed yet again for the last train home in order to be up at the crack of dawn to travel North. As I checked my watch I realised that the lovely restaurant staff had obviously long since given up on their attempts to get us to vacate our table at 10pm and I wondered what lay ahead for the rest of the crew........ A very memorable evening and based on this experience a great venue for a fairly large party who want to eat top notch tapas, drink and make merry.",

    "text": "Tierra Brindisa is the spot for decent-to-pretty-good tapas in Soho. The menu is reasonable and the wine selection is fine (but lacking in by-the-glass options), but the experience was lacking in a way that I just couldn't put my finger on. A group of our colleagues meandered down to Broadwick Street for a nice tapas lunch not too long ago and ended up in the light, airy, but somehow still squished-feeling rear of the dining room. The server was nice, friendly, and helpful, but that's pretty much all I can remember about the service-element of the meal, for better or worse. The menu was similar to the service element in that I had to refer back to the website just now to even remember anything about it. Ah, yes, now I remember--pleasant, but unremarkable. There really was very little on the menu that piqued my interest the way that, say, the Stuffed And Honey Drizzled Courgette Flowers at Salt Yard can. All the tapas standards were there, except the patatas fritas that day, sadly. The fryer was broken and there was no way to improvise. I do remember the dipping oil for the bread being quite fantastic, but I'm not sure what it says about a menu that the only thing I specifically remember was the dipping oil.All in all, the meal was perfectly nice and not at all unpleasant. I think that Tierra Brindisa has perhaps been harmed by the prevalence of really extraordinary tapas restaurants in Soho such as Salt Yard and Dehesa because as lovely as it was, it doesn't hold a candle to either of its rivals. This is a high-3-nearly-4 star review I'm giving, but a few exciting additions to its menu would help move it up a bracket to a solid 4.",

    "text": "Overview: The atmosphere is like most of the tapas bar, nothing much special. We sat by the bar, so can't say if it is more intimate or romantic if you sit inside. Food is served in a way I like: one after another, we never had two plates on our table, but didn't wait for long for the next dish. I love everything we ordered, and more details below. So it is good if you want something casual to have, and it is not too pricy.Gambas: the oil was still boiling when it was brought to the table. It is a very common dish in a tapas bar, but it tasted better than average. You can tell the prawn is fresh, and the hot oil kept its original flavour together with the flavour of the spices. Pulpo: again, very common dish, but better than average. Cordero: it is ok, nothing too special about it, but tasty.Carrillera: I love it so much! I think it is slow cooked, and it is so tender! You could feel it is melting in your mouth! The flavour of the spices was not strong and it went very well with the meat. It came with mash sweet potatoes, which is creamy and soft. Love it so much!Presa: this is amazing! I am not a pork lover myself, but it is cooked in a so much tender way, and I have to say I love it! It is not far at all, but when you bite it, it is so juicy and creamy. I am not a fan of green peppers, but the flavour of the green pepper mixed very well with the pork. Definitely recommended!",

I ordered the patatas bavas, gambas al ajillo, octopus, Catalan spinach, and salt cod fritters. Everything was superb- portion size, presentation, and taste! Great for sharing and experiencing tapas at its best.The reason for not giving it 5 stars, after we finished the main course, dessert menus were given to us we didn't see our server for at least 20 minutes after. Flagging down another server to order desserts, our server finally shows up. She explains she had to take her break, on a packed Friday night at 8:30??? Not sure if this is a required routine or a whim because when we were finished with our main course, the hostess came to check on our table to see if we were finished yet. When we finally got to order our desserts, we chose an almond tart, and vanilla mousse with raspberry which were both delicious!The hostess came over again and had to run our check charges because our server was too busy- again feeling pushed out but was really was not our fault.Been in this business too long, if there is a time restraint for the table, the server should be informed and stay on top of it- don't make the customer feel like \"eat it, and now beat it\"Don't let my experience steer you away- the food, ambience, and decor will definitely keep you happy.",

The cheese selection was very good, although it tended towards goats cheeses, so if you're not into that... oh well.The least enjoyable dish we had was the manchego salad- the dressing was a little oily and didn't have much flavour. everything else was great! they even brought us some more aoli sauce, which was super delicious.I would recommend this place and i can't wait to go back!",

The quality is high but nothing really stood out as amazing. The charcuterie plate was copious but the slices of meat were very thinly sliced. \u00a0Too much so, in my opinion. \u00a0I don't think they could have made them any thinner!Tortilla did what it said in the tin. I liked that is was a thickly cut wedge rather than some of the thinner pieces you sometimes get. Spinach salad with pine nuts and raisins was tasty but not necessarily anything to write home about. Prawns cooked with garlic could have had a bit more garlicky-ness to them but they were well cooked and not overdone. I enjoyed this the most. Ham croquettes weren't that interesting. Mushy potato with ham, deep fried with a crunchy coating. \u00a0I should stop ordering these. They sound better than they ever are!It was a fine way to pass a leisurely lunchtime visit but I wouldn't make it a destination spot by my means.

What else could we do but prop up the bar (once the space was available) and sample some wine. It didn't take as long as we thought for a table to become free and once we were seated, we set about ordering everything that sounded even mildly tempting. All of us are big charcuterie and cheese fans and the Iberico board was very generous and packed full of delicious meats. The cheese board was smaller but each cheese came with a suitable pairing like membrillo or fig. The croquettas are creamy and delicious and are worth a special mention! There were a couple more plates but the thing that was really special was the salt cod. This came up served with apple. Yes, fish and fruit. i thought the same, that cannot work but it does!! and it is delicious! A sentiment shared by all three of us initially skeptical women. I rounded off the evening with a crema catalana \u00a0(shared between three!) and a sherry that touted itself as 'christmas pudding in a glass' and like the rest of the food, this completely delivered.",

    "text": "It's small (it's Soho), but it's got decent tapas fare. I've eaten here twice. Once was just the other night, and I feel like the decor or seating arrangement had changed since the previous time, but I can't be certain. Everything came on time and tasted as I expected it. The service was OK, though the waitress was a bit awkward. She kept staring at me after I ordered, as though I hadn't spoken yet. Weirdo.Fair wine selection. Noisy crowd, both times I've been. And, the first time, I was with a girl who decided to cry during the meal. Not due to the food or service. It must have been something I did. That was fun. The servers were nice enough to leave us alone during most of it, so that was alright.Lastly, the front door doesn't close on it's own. Be a good lad and close it behind you, or your fellow diners (especially the ones in the front) might get chilly.",

    "text": "Wrote a review for this place a few years back and had a bit of a moan about it. Came here a couple of weeks ago and had a much better time.The quality of the food was still excellent, but the size of the dishes had improved greatly from my last visit. My friend and I got in here quite late, but the manager was very accommodating. The place has had a refurb since I was last in, and seems a lot better for it. We sat by the window at the front, and the manger talked me through a couple of dishes I was unaware of, and i'm glad he did as it was really good.Overall it was just over \u00a350 for a few dishes and a bottle of wine, good value for the quality of the food.",

It has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are friendly and helpful, the food is great even if a tad on the expensive side but to be expected in London!!! Really enjoyed our evening out here!!",

    "text": "Went to this place on my last night in London and my experience helped make it one of the best nights of my month-long stay in England. We got a bottle of wine to split between four of us and enjoyed the outdoor seating with a view of the Market. We split aioli with bread that I only wish I could recreate. I got the wilted spinach with pine nuts and chorizo with rocket and roasted red peppers on grilled bread. I have tried to recreate both because they were so insanely delicious. There are certain spots that I've encountered in my travels that make me want to go back to the city just to experience again. I can't wait for the next time I travel to London so that I can order that meal one more time. I won't even go near any tapas places in New York because I'm afraid it'll taint my experience at Brindasa.Great to walk around Borough Market first and then stop off for dinner before a show at the Globe or some sight-seeing. Also great date spot. I went in early August during the last week of the 2012 Olympics and even then it was peaceful, relaxing, and not at all over-crowded.",
