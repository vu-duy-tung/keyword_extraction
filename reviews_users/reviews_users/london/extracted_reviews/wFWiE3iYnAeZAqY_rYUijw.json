    "text": "For the first time in well over a year I walked past The Breakfast Club in Spitalfields and there wasn't a queue, I grab my other halves hand and said to him 'We're eating here!' Luckily he trust me when it comes to picking the places we chow down at, and he wasn't disappointed at all.The atmosphere is buzzing, despite being nearly 10pm on a Tuesday night, and the decor made me feel as though I was in America. I felt totally at home instantly. The menu had loads to choose from, including an all day breakfast so the place really lives up to its name. My burrito was probably the best I'd even tried, filled to the brim with chicken, rice, all your sauces and salad. It was so large I struggled to finish, which is saying a lot for someone with my appetite! My other half had a chicken and bacon and sandwich, and I had never seen so much filling! It wasn't filled with salad either; it was pure chicken and bacon with a splash of barbecue sauce! It looked simply divine!We had no room at all to fit in desert, but they sounded awesome. May have to pop them on my 'to try' list if we can ever get a table again! Drinks were reasonable priced, and staff were really lovely too.I would really recommend trying the food here, you get a lot for your money, and I was certainly filled to the brim, which is quite rare for me. If you can get there early enough of a weekend rumour has it that their breakfasts work wonders for your hangover from the night before.And don't forget to ask to see the Mayor!",

    "text": "As a Canadian living in London i was craving something other then the standard fair that most breakfast joints around town are serving.. something a little more original or creative.. or as I realized later a little more like home. I came on a week day so it was busy but I didn't have to wait in line. I ordered a coffee which I have to say was really freaking good. As i sipped it, it slowly revealed I love BC, which i automatically thought of my home province (British Columbia), but knew it had to do with the Breakfast Club. I ordered the full veg breakfast. I loved the veg sausage and maple agave syrup the most. The pancakes tasted like they had been made the day before and microwaved and reserved. Also my food came so fast I knew it was almost all pre made which makes me question the quality. I am not unreasonable and I know it is hard to serve a restaurant full of people always 'fresh' food but just so you know it isn't made to order.. it's already made and being reheated.Decor was great, and the guys working were super nice.",

THE FUCK would I hear about a brunch spot in London? I know and love the movie. This place better be good.And muy bueno! So much better than the lacklustre Yelp star rating would indicate. This place was absolute tits. Yep, the wait for a table was a little longer than my distressed stomach would have liked but everything else was at least 4-star worthy. My breakfast burrito bitch-slapped my stomach back into submission. Our staff-lady was lovely. She gave the hoped-for knowing smirk when I asked for the whoriest bloody mary possible at 11am on a Sunday. The price was absolutely reasonable. I absolutely recommend this place for oft-needed hungover fry-up. And the music is awesome.",

    "text": "The last addition to the branches of The Breakfast Club in London was the place chosen to have brunch on my birthday, and I was truly looking forward to it. A friend of mine works here and I salivated every time she described a new dish she got to try. And she was indeed right. I chose the pancakes & berries, a huge, unstable and scrumptious tower of 4 thick pancakes covered in maple syrup, berries and vanilla cream, that was amazing. Seriously, the yummiest thing I've tried for a while (it helped that I was quite hungry, I must admit). My partner got eggs benedict, that were very good as well. For drink, a iced soya latte and freshly squeezed orange juice, that were fine. I was really happy we came here.It was early when we came in, around noon, but the place started to fill up when we left. I've been told that on weekends people queue outside before they open for breakfast, and that for lunch on weekdays it gets very busy as well. After trying it, I'm not surprised at all.Also, the decor, menu and general vibe are quite cool, and the staff is lovely (not only my friend, who wasn't there at that time!). Now I have to go and try the drinks on the other side of the Smeg fridge ^^",

But, to my delight, the English twist on American comfort food (and breakfast) was delightful. I had barbeque pulled pork on a sandwich and coleslaw and fries and my friend had pancakes with berries and whipped cream. The whole time we ate, they kept saying there was a surprise. Later on, we asked to see \"the mayor\" (which we were really confused about) and, again to my delight, we were escorted to a fabulous, classy, dark, mood-lit bar in the basement. The drinks we had here were among the best hand crafted cocktails I've ever had the privilege of delighting my taste buds with. The Old Fashion was perfection and I watched as the barkeep lovingly hand-made our cocktails to perfection. She took her time making these beautiful drinks and it was a grand success!

The concept sounds like it will work but the result is not that impressive. \u00a0I have also been to the Soho one and was always wondering what the long line is about. \u00a0Perhaps its popularity is a function of how few brunch places there are in town but compared to brunch food in america, it is honestly a bit overrated. \u00a0There is a speakeasy in the basement and you go through the fridge door to get there, then you exit through the doors to the bathrooms. \u00a0I could not help notice hordes of people, men and women all coming out from the bathroom doors every 5 to 10 mins =) \u00a0Seems like a cool and fun speakeasy, have to go back and try.",

    "text": "Once when I came here, I ordered pancakes with maple syrup and bacon. Vile! I'm normally quite receptive to trying sweet and savoury tastes mixed together, but there was a whole pool of very cheap tasting maple syrup, and they had dredged the dish with so much icing sugar that I felt like my teeth would drop out before we left the restaurant. The taste of bacon was so obliterated by the overwhelming sweetness of everything else that it might as well have not even been there.However, I have since (reluctantly) been back with work colleagues. Learning from my previous mistake, I ordered the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and avocado on toast, which I really couldn't fault. The portion was generous, but so delicious that I just had to finish it.I'd say that there are a few hit and miss options on this menu, but each to their own. It does seem as though there is something for everyone here, my advice would be to pick carefully and avoid busy times. Apart from that, it's quite a nice place to share some food with a few friends or workmates.",

As you queue you are greeted with pictures of previous diners strung up on old metal school pegs and disposable cameras so you can take your own to be added to the collection. The school theme continues into the restaurant with booths made from the little benches that used to accompany school pegs back in the day. Their brunch menu offers pretty much anything your hungry little tum desires and is served all day long. They also have a great Lunch & Dinner menu and a secret bar behind the fridge door (I can't tell you anymore than that it's so secret!) It loses a point as, in my opinion, the drinks prices are quite steep.",

Possibly the best brekkie experience ever. As I bobbed my head, I listened closer for other tunes! Beware the secret American style fridge that leads to a downstairs cocktail bar! Yes, that's right, you walk through a fridge to get to an 80s inspired cocktail bar! \u00a0In a prime location down a side street, be prepared for a little wait! Venue is fab, with lots of cool memorabilia. Staff are very friendly and accommodating... You could quietly stay there for hours to your stomachs content! Prices are average for the quality and experience. Portions are nice but as my food was served luke warm, I was a little disappointed.

She booked a table at the breakfast club, with the intention of moving on from dinner to a meeting with the mysterious mayor of scaredy cat town. I liked the food reasonably well, but wouldn't list it among the best things I have eaten in this category of food and price range. The thing that made me laugh was that in accordance with its name, breakfast is served. Always. One of my friends, who had a rather strange rhythm of life at this moment, craved a night breakfast. So while I was enjoying my green salad, he got to enjoy a huge American breakfast. Breakfast with a cocktail, who wouldn't want that? I would totally return for the cocktails and should I ever crave eggs Benedict at night, I know where to go.While service was good at dinner time, we felt a bit disappointed when we wanted to meet the mayor. It was a popular day for this incredible mystery, but I feel they should have told us that the waiting time was outrageously long for groups. Because waiting and seeing people entering the bar when they haven't waited isn't fun. This is why we ultimately decided to leave the place to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "American style pancakes? \u00a0Yes please! \u00a0As an American, sometimes I really long for something familiar from the motherland. \u00a0So when my friend (a fellow American) suggested The Breakfast Club because she had their pancakes and said they were wonderful, I decided, I'd put it on my list. \u00a0I knew they had different locations and since I was going to be out by this particular one... I decided I would try this location.I almost walked right past it and actually wasn't sure if the yellow, unmarked door was the entrance. \u00a0When I walked in, there was loud music playing, and loads of... stuff everywhere. \u00a0There were quite a few tables open, so I figured wouldn't have to wait. \u00a0Except I did... for a waitress to acknowledge I was standing there. \u00a0One of them made eye contact with me... so she had to come over. \u00a0I know, bummer. \u00a0Anyway she proceeds to say, \"Do you mind sharing a table?\" \u00a0Before I get off topic with a rant about how solo diners get treated... \u00a0let's just say I was not pleased with the other tables available. \u00a0I said, \"Uh, I guess so...\" and gave her a look. \u00a0And before she sat me with a couple (a couple... how awkward could that possibly get), she took me back toward the door and found me high top table to sit at.I was on a mission... pancakes, so even though there were other items catching my eye, I would complete my mission. \u00a0Originally I had thought to just order pancakes straight up... kind of like a whisky neat, but my gut (or my hungry tummy) was urging me to the All-American, which did have pancakes included. \u00a0Perfect. \u00a0The waitress who was serving me was very friendly and attentive... not sure if it was pity because I was eating breakfast on my own or because she was really interested in chatting to me, but it was kind of nice to talk about a couple of book recommendations and shopping recommendations.My food came out (I posted a picture). \u00a0It was quite a bit, but it was pretty good. \u00a0The bacon (streaky bacon) was as I like it... almost to the point of crispy, but still a bit chewy. \u00a0The sausage was an English sausage, which I prefer to American sausage (I hear you stifling your giggles... pervs). \u00a0The hash browns were not what I know as hash browns though. \u00a0Where I am from, we would call these home fries, but they were good. \u00a0Now... the pancakes. \u00a0They were the disappointment of my meal. \u00a0Something was a bit off, they kind of tasted like cardboard and the maple syrup didn't taste like real or fake maple syrup to me... just a sweet syrup.I don't know if I'll be back, it wasn't awful, but it didn't quite live up to expectations.",

Fingers crossed that TBC marks the beginning of a quiet revolution though...I've been here a few times now, first with a friend who was showing me around my new stomping grounds, a couple of times for meetings with clients and a few times for pleasure too.Now this place is quite hidden away near Liverpool St station and has (or so I hear) a speakeasy style bar tucked away inside a Smeg fridge converted into a door. It's not difficult to find really but certainly is not the kind of place you may stumble upon as a tourist wandering around the area.I usually order an American full, although I have to admit I can't actually remember if that's what it's called now... 1 sausage, a slice of bacon, two pancakes, scrambled eggs, home style hash browns (think bubble and squeak) came to about \u00a39. Coffee and juice on top of that and it's a close to \u00a315 per head affair which I feel is a little on the pricy side considering the portions are not so generous.It would be delightful to see some real American classics on the menu, pancakes and bacon are great but what about french toast and bacon, waffles and bacon or even... chicken and waffles! Come on please, indulge me...I mentioned that I wanted to love this place and I'm still trying to find that love. I do go back out of my own volition and enjoy the food they serve but wish that the portions were larger and some truly indulgent options were available on the menu. Come on chicken and waffles/french toast and bacon! Aside from that, this is a perfectly charming place to have brunch, with its industrial chic decor and tucked away location, it's a lovely little gem that you'd never guess was in such a central location!",

Food at both was quite poor. I have had both the waffles and chicken as well as the breakfast burrito and both were so average in taste I was amazed. The breakfast burrito, in particular, was basically inedible. The fruit juice drinks are good and interesting and coffee was also fine but for the line-up to get in and general hype, there are better places in London.",

Have to say was the best brekkie consisting of two fried eggs, pancakes with maple syrup, a veggie sausage, roastie potatoes and mushrooms. My plate was nearly finished, a great pick me up and setting me off for bed. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to visit the mayor, but definitely next time. The wings were also the best, that sauce really made them, so juicy, tender, fall off the bone. The burgers were good and filling. It is recommended!",

My husband ordered white tea and got English breakfast tea with milk. When he clarified that he meant the kind of white tea that is actually white tea leaves the waitress insisted that black tea with milk IS white tea. We get this sort of confusion a lot in the States, where tea drinking is still not really well understood, but this is the first time anyone anywhere in the UK has not understood what white tea leaves are. He doesn't drink black tea, but the waitress was so convinced that he had gotten the right thing that we wound up paying for it anyway. The extra-strange part: we checked online later, and the specific tea he was trying to order (\"Whiter than White\") IS white tea leaves, advertised as such by the manufacturer. The most amusing/annoying tea snafu I've experienced since someone in North Carolina tried to convince me that rooibos is caffeinated.I ordered greek yoghurt with granola. The waitress even repeated it back: \"Greek yoghurt?\" and to be sure I pointed to it on the menu and said, \"Yes, greek yoghurt\". What came out was fruit salad with a scoop of what might have been yoghurt on it. I didn't want to be the complete moron who doesn't understand how yoghurt is served in the UK, so instead I was the moron who eats fruit salad for breakfast instead of what I ordered. I was tired, hungry and I really didn't feel like going another round with the waitress, so I figured better be the less stressful kind of moron. But it was a bummer.The food was fairly good, especially the items we intended to order - I can't fault them on quality, though some items are more of a riff on American food than traditional American (for example, their eggy French toast is very dry in comparison to what you get in the States). I just don't like eating surprise food for breakfast - I want to get what I order and then eat it. Seems simple enough, right? Don't count on it here.",

    "text": "Like walking into a 1950s movie set, The Breakfast Club is an in-your-face retro diner-feel experience. I had been hearing for ages about the Mayor through the iconic Smeg fridge and the brilliant boozy brunch menu. Brunch has become a vital staple of my every afternoon during the past 'social' month in London, so I was eager to see what all the hype was about in Spitalfields.I was pleasantly surprised that this London favorite wasn't rammed but it is slightly in a nook on what is otherwise a business street, unlike some of their more well known locations. My entrance was met with a general cacophony of conversation which was slightly too noisy for my liking, especially as I was meeting an acquaintance I had not seen for 5 years with whom I was eager to have an actual catch-up. It didn't help that I was still experiencing the remnants of a headache which felt akin to a small gremlin residing in my brain and taking an icepick to my skull. You know the one. \u00a0However, my keen sense of cocktail necessity coaxed me into having a Bloody Mary. I waited at my wooden cafeteria-style bench for my celery stalked drink. It was well done, with just the right kick. Bloody Marys are the only way I can take vodka, and I consider myself an amateur connoisseur. Yes, enjoy that oxymoron. As I waited for my friend, I looked over the menu, really trying to make the best choice amongst all my breakfast favorities and avoid food-envy. I am not a fan of sweet breaky, rather gravitating to the savory eggs/potatos/crispy bacon often doused in an ungodly amount of grease. The chorizo hashbrowns with feta cheese were tempting and the huevas rancheros (eggs, chedder, refried beans, guacamole, chorizo, sour cream) were a close second. However, I ended up playing it somewhat safe with the breakfast burrito which was similar in ingredients with the latter huevas rancheros but featuring scrambled and with spicy pepper sauce. No diners remorse here! Large American style helping which I barely finished and which complemented my Blood M well. The chorizo pieces were not overwhelming to the overall flavor. Also, they were generous with the guac which I appreciated as its creaminess along with the acidic sour cream really elevated this dish. Another morning dog bite assuaged by the power of brunch.",

Of course this is a self-dubbed title, but nonetheless I'm sure that my badge and decoder ring are en route to my residence as we speak.The Breakfast Club is definitely a gem in this city. From the second you walk in you are engulfed in the fun-loving atmosphere. The decor gives off a funky vibe that'll have you thinking you're John bender himself. The staff are super chill and cool. The way they interact with each other is as if they are really in a close-knit club, and they make you feel like a member as well.For my dish I decided to dine on the Chorizo Hash (Chorizo, grilled peppers,mushrooms, caramlised crushed potatoes, poached egg with a lemon & feta sauce). Now I have to admit when I first tasted the lemon & feta sauce, by itself, I was worried. The sauce was great, but I didn't think it was going to mesh well with the other flavors in the dish. Send me to detention now because I was absolutely wrong for thinking such a thing. The freshness and tang of the sauce provided a beautiful compliment to the spicy chorizo in the dish.The best thing about this place however is going to see the Mayor. The mayor's place is very swaggy, but be careful because he/she doesn't play around with their drinks. Probably the greatest mayor I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Can't wait to sit down for another drink.",

We were lucky that it wasn't raining as the queue was 30-40 deep and snaking down the road, however in the end we only queued 45 minutes (I'd expected over an hour). We were sat by the door on high tables so it was a bit chilly, uncomfortable and there was no back support - be-warned when being offered these. The decor is quirky and very shabby chic and it had a good buzz but there were actually quite a few tables that were free - perhaps they needed the kitchen to catch up?We were asked immediately if we wanted a drink, however hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu. We all went for teas or coffees which came in good time. We then ordered our food. This is when the reaaaaal wait began. It got to about 30 minutes and everyone around us had got their food. The waiter hadn't even noticed so we called him over and he went to find out where our food was... well the order hadn't even been given in! Thanks then! Another waiter came over, profusely apologised, tole us the food would be on the house and then asked us if we would like another drink. This time I went for one of the juices. They are pricey but without the food on the bill I thought I should take advantage. It was pineapple & ginger flavoured - very refreshing!The food came out 10-15 minutes later and my golly was it good! The chorizo, poaches egg muffin is just so good! Eggs cooked to perfection, delicious chorizo on top and a little green leaf on the side. The All America looked good as did the chorizo hash.Really because of service they only deserve a 3* but the food was so good and the apology we recieved in the way of free food made up for it! As you can tell this is a seriously biased review! If you don't want to queue for a truly awesome breakfast I would avoid this place on the weekend!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to the Breakfast Club for a while - after all , brinner is for winners. So we were in town (although at brunch time) and nearby so decided to give it a go.First off, the queue was about 45 minutes long. I figured it was all people wanting to see the Mayor but nope, all there for breakfast. I had expected it to be more eighties themed but aside from a Commodore 64 box perched on a cabinet, there wasn't much. Drawings on napkins seemed to be the theme.I ordered the chorizo hash with scrambled eggs instead of fried. The service was good here too, except they forgot my wife's side of avocado and then kept it on the bill. It was removed when we said though. My chorizo was good quality and I polished off the plate easily - I'd added feta and that gave a nice variety of flavours. My only complaint was that I ended up with a puddle of water at the bottom of the plate - maybe that came from the different eggs.Frankly the length of the queue would put me off returning soon. It's not the fault of the staff or the kitchen, both work fast. The issue is that some customers seem to think its fine to finish their meal and sit around for an age taking up a table that someone standing outside in the rain could be using. Honestly there was one table that ordered nothing the entire time we were there and then finished up ordering pancakes between the two of them just before we left. Actually pancakes as pudding for breakfast isn't such a bad idea...",

Very good breakfast selections. Fresh squeezed OJ really good. I had the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on multigrain toast. The salmon was EXCELLENT. I've also eaten the All-American breakfast, really good choice, but it's too much food for me. Mostly younger locals seen here today, but this spot is really great for us older tourists too!",

The wait is a little long, especially on weekends, but even on a busy day we were sat within 20 minutes. Oh, be prepared for slow service on busy days. I understand that servers have to tend to multiple tables but because my boyfriend and I were sat in the corner, it felt like our server forgot about us a few times. As far as the food goes, it's probably one of the best I've had in London. I love the Chorizo Hash and I think they have reasonably sized portions (though still slightly smaller than American portions, but who needs that much food anyway??). Will definitely come back here again the next time I visit and craving a hearty American breakfast.",

Quickly ushered to our table we ordered drinks and then went over the menu.Dad enjoyed a full English breakfast while I went for the chorizo hash. If I'm honest I would assume that something advertised as having peppers and onions would have more than a few strips, but there were plenty of mushrooms and chorizo to be had so wasn't complaining too much.Food was good, the atmosphere was good, and unfortunately we were too early to see the mayor.

The hipsters were out in full force. I imagine half of London's Instagram traffic was going through this one location.I ordered the chorizo hash with feta and avocado. The avocado never came, and I never had a chance to get it as no one checked on us until we were done (but it was on the bill. It was removed when I queried but a pain, nonetheless). The chorizo was well cooked and tasty, but my eggs were underdone and there was a bit of clearish goo on much of my food. I only realised when the food came that no one ever asked how I wanted my eggs (I would have said over easy...)It was just all trying a bit too hard and to be honest, I'm way past giving a damn about something being cool.

The decor is kitschy and the menu has creative riffs on breakfast staples, but our experience was less than stellar.We entered just before noon but when trying to place an order for their Secret Egg Society specialty sandwich, we were told they could not serve it any more. I'm totally understanding of limitations on serving certain menus at certain times, but this decision didn't make any sense considering the ingredients are used in other dishes that are still available- like all the Benedicts and classics. I guess someone just doesn't want to make toast in the afternoon? But they have burgers and sandwiches available instead? Go figure.The cold brew and latte we ordered were okay, once we got past the other bizarre \u00a0part where they don't have any sweetener available for drinks. The porridge with plums was surprisingly tasty. I don't understand the hype here.",

We told her one of the places, which was this restaurant and she advised us to go and said it was her favorite. She gave us directions and we were on our way.We walked in and we were seated right away. We got a window seat, although the restaurant is on a small side street without a view. The music was very loud for breakfast, but didn't seem overly loud. My food was ok, I wouldn't say it was great, but it wasn't bad. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the breakfast burrito which was huge! They have a lot to choose from on the menu. I would probably try them out again if in Londo.",

Ordered Huevos Racheros, was worse quality than tiny Mexican hole in the walls I go to over in America. Waitress was dismissive and did not speak English. Very expensive. Very poor quality of food.Coupled with this, huevos Rancheros is always served with Corn tortillas, here it was served with Flour. My friend had a severe gluten allergy, it took asking the waiter, 4 different times, if the tortilla was wheat, or corn. 4 times, each time she replied quite snotilly \"yes it's corn\" and then she asked another waiter, who looked over with disdain, shook his hand dismissively and said \"yes it's corn\". I was worried, so I picked it up and sniffed it. It was not corn. I asked once more, for the manager, who looked scared and said \"No it is wheat flour\". Coupled with that, even the Chorizo contained gluten, which is the first I have ever heard of that. They don't know what they're doing, they are very dismissive, and they are going to kill someone. I do not understand the line at this place, because you should really avoid it. I'm sorry, wish my review could have been more positive, but this place needs to close and reevaluate. I will be calling to complain.",

They were also very attentive during my visit... but I went at 9 pm in the evening and there were very many other patrons.Food: now the important part. The food was amazing!! My husband and I ordered two fresh pressed juices - which were made to order and tasted amazing!! We also shared the pancakes with berries and vanilla whipped cream. It was SO good! \u00a0The COOL factor: we also visited the Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town. Definitely ask for this feature if you're up for something truly amazing I look forward to coming back.

The yoghurty sauce was nice and tangy and fresh, complementing the salty chorizo and potatoes. The bell peppers and onions gave it a nice sweetness and it was just good. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because we had to wait really long for our food (im pretty sure the waiter made a mistake) and also, its not thaaat special.

I called to confirm our booking this morning, and although we arrived on time, we still had to wait to be seated - even though the restaurant was only about 1/3 full. We ordered fairly quickly, but waited about 35-40 mins for our meals.. Which would have been OK, if all our meals were actually served. When the 3 of the meals arrived, our waiter said that my 'Number 3 Wrap' was still on the way... 10 mins later, still nothing. The waiter came over again to tell me it was on the way... Another 5 mins - nothing. My friends had finished with their meals (or in the case of the mex mac - she had eaten as much as possible - as it was basically an entire bowl of cheese with a VERY few pieces of macaroni), and were just waiting around for my mythical wrap, I went up to the counter to cancel it (time to go back to work - late!). Even after saying that we had ordered almost a hour beforehand, and that the other meals had come out except mine - no apology was offered by any of the staff.. Even the waiter that took our order in the first place didn't seem to care. And then when we were FINALLY attended to to be able to pay (another 5/10mins), they still had the audacity to charge for my diet Coke!?I was really looking forward to a meal here, especially as I've heard all about it since moving to London - but after this experience, I'm extremely disappointed. What should have been a nice Xmas lunch with friends, left me hungry - and all of us annoyed.",

It is surprisingly difficult to find a place in close proximity to the station that is not infested by investment bankers and alike,basically people wearing stilettos and suits. They make me feel intimidated as I can't walk in stilettos and my only suit is gathering dust in my wardrobe. Isn't this a lovely place?Thank god for the Breakfast Club! Part of a small London based chain,it is a place where people with and without suits feel welcome as it's very inviting and relaxed indeed. The design is lovely and unique and so are the waiters. It could become my new local,if it wasn't for the food which is not great. It feels the energy and the obvious enthusiasm of the owners has focused on the interior and concept and has somehow not extended to the food. Having said that,I went to The Breakfast Club in the evening but of course it's called Breakfast Clubso the breakfast might be the best in town,I wouldn't know the breakfast menu is long,detailed and certainly very intriguing,well worth a try! But now the dinner: For starters we had some olives and feta bad presentation and really bad olives. The tin sort,that I am surprised is still sold and even more surprised that someone actually buys. If I pay round 4,5 pounds for olives,I think it's a joke to get served something like this. The humous was served with a generous helping of mediocre flat bread and was itself of the rather mediocre variant. We had salads as mains (yes I am kind of pretending to be on a diet). Both of the salads were certainly edible and although I didn't exactly love them,I wouldn't mind eating them again. The Cesar Salad came with a rich dressing and a multitude of parmesan,chicken,bacon and humongous croutons. I have had better,I have had worse. More interesting was the Salad of Jerusalem Artichoke. The Jerusalem artichokes were very nicely prepared and tasted lovely. I like seeds on my salads,so I was very happy with the sunflower seeds that were generously sprinkled on top. The 'shallots'were enormous pieces of onions which I ignored,but apart from this not a bad salad at all. It is rare that I send back a dessertI would say it has thus far been unheard of. We just couldn't eat the Apple Grumble. It tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for too long and had therefore taken on the taste of other (mostly savoury) things that were stored in its surroundings. Not even being served warm could hide the fact that is was clearly past its sell by date.. We didn't want a dessert replacement,because now it was time to go to the S*E*C*R*E*T bar. (I shouldn't tell you about this really) And where else would a secret bar be hidden,but in the fridge? Where is the secret bar?If you ask nicely,you might get the concierge to lead you thereIt is certainly worth it,(and not only because one feels so superior being in a SECRET bar),One could call it US inspired,playing US rock and Americana and serving American style snacks as well as drinks. The atmosphere is endearing,the waiters charming and the cocktails delicious. Who would have thought that you can have such a great time in a fridge? No more words,go and see for yourself.",

I normally order the pancakes and bacon. For \u00a37.50 you get around 7 rashers of bacon and stack of 4-5 pancakes smothered in maple syrup!! Lively atmosphere but watch out as can get busy!!",
