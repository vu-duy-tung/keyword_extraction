    "text": "Muriel's Kitchen is a nice little oasis in the hustle and bustle of South Kensington station. I think the reason I like this place is it reminds me of a place I could find back in California. (Mostly) healthy, fresh food that emphasizes seasonal ingredients at reasonable prices. Their salad box makes a healthy filling lunch and comes in at \u00a35. You should also try the Miso salmon, which is delicious! My friend thoroughly enjoyed their veggie curry, which was lighter than a typical curry, but packed in just as great flavor.The service here is great - I have gotten both takeout from here as well as dined in. The staff is attentive and helpful, but I can see that at busier times the service could likely fall off a bit. The decor and ambiance when not overly crowded is great. You honestly feel like you're in someone's dining room. I'd say if you're in the area and in the mood for a solid meal that is on the healthier side, this is one of the better choices in the area.",

I ordered the lasagna and a side of sliced potatoes, only to discover that my food was not freshly prepared. In fact, it seemed that it was reheated in the microwave quite possibly. \u00a0Whether it be the oven or microwave, it still repulses me that this overpriced restaurant doesn't have the sense to prepare fresh food and actually preps it in advance as it gets stored in their display case for who knows what period of time! Luckily, \u00a0this restaurant occupies a prime location next to the tube and attracts starved passerbys. Otherwise, I doubt anyone would bother paying such a premium on 'reheated' food! \u00a0Go elsewhere if in the area!",

I thought it was cafeteria style but if you are dining in, they will seat you and give you a menu to order from. The staff is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu. We ordered:Famous Beef Lasagna - YUM! Big portion and flavorful. Lamb, Feta and Mixed Herbs w/Spicy Fenugreek Yoghurt - This was like a meatball. It was a delicious combination of herbs and dipping it into the yoghurt was perfect.Char-grilled Salmon w/Tomato, Onion, Chilli and Coriander Relish - The salmon was a typical grilled salmon. The standout in this dish was the coriander relish, that was really good.Mixed Green Beans and Courgette w/Truffle Oil, Dill and Tarragon - The amount of truffle oil was light and the beans were cooked perfectly.Roasted Aubergine w/Wild Garlic Yoghurt, Tomato, Red Onion and Chilli - My FAVORITE dish here! It was a creamy eggplant that may not look very appetizing but tasted incredible. I would come back for this dish.We ordered and ate family style which I recommend because you get to try more things. There were a lot of desserts there too but we were too full to try any. Great location right next to the tube station and super close to the bus stops.",

We wandered around the park in the dimming light and could not find the class; to be fair the instructions told us to walk north-east and we didn't have a compass.We gave up walking around the park as we had already wasted 35 minutes of an hour class and stumbled across Muriel's kitchen.Our frostbitten fingers were more than happy to walk into this toasty and cake filled wonderland.We ate cake, I had a coffee and my friend had a pink lemonade. The cake was phenomenal and everything was to kitsch and cute we stayed longer than we needed to.A highlight was the super friendly waitress with probably the most impeccable skin I've seen in a long time (it must be the cake I told myself).The little details made it for me; such as hanging our coats on repurposed forks and the fact the flower pots dangled from the ceiling.We sat in the window and people watched, its right on a corner so we had plenty of things to look at.Muriel's kitchen, at that time, was a cosy oasis in a horrible evening and really redeemed our desperate lost wanderings through a freezing park.",

Tables are too tight, it's like breakfast in a restaurant for incredibly skinny short people, and because it is so popular you are crammed in there like the proverbial sardine!2. The host on the day was an overly enthusiastic French lady who was just a bit too IN YOUR FACE. Which is annoying when you are still waking up and are very very hungry.That's it really, now for the good stuff. orange .juice which tastes as if it was squeezed by fruity cherubs, and incredibly tasty strong coffee. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, including bacon, spinach, tomato, avocado, fried or scrambled eggs and some of the most amazing cheddar cheese I have ever tasted. I had my eggs scrambled, and they didn't hold back, and the bread is whole meal, but not overly toasted so the edges don't cut the roof of your mouth. I needed some ketchup also, and they had some gourmet stuff which blew my mind. Seriously this food is damn near perfect, and I want to go back and marry that sandwich.",

My one complaint is that I ordered an apple juice only to receive a pear juice, which was tasty but not what I ordered. I would definitely come again.",

The drinks and cakes were just astonishingly good. I had a freshly squeezed apply juice - not too sure how this is possible but it tastes like you are eating an apple - worth a try any day of the week.The four varieties of cakes we sampled (there were four us not a greedy two!) were delicious. Light and airy or thick and flavoursome. A great find I will be encouraging others to visit. Although it is not cheap...",

    "text": "Loved the ambiance of this little restaurant from the outside and the yummy looking counter top displays (it reminded us of Joan's on 3rd at home in Los Angeles).Stopped here for an early dinner on our last night in the UK. The restaurant is pretty small but quaint. There are three communal counter style seating areas and a small section of tables and booths (perhaps 10-12?) in the rear.The food is pre-made but fresh and displayed in a beautiful array at the front entry. After you make your selections they're heated up and brought to your table.When I spied it on the menu I knew I had to try the Cauliflower with saffron & parmesan soup! (Ever since having this delicious concoction at James' Beach in Venice, CA, I always keep an eye out for it.) The bowl was a more than generous amount, however, the soup was extremely bland. You could taste a bare hint of saffron but absolutely no parm. I added a heavy dose of salt and pepper which helped, but not much as those truly needed to be added during the cooking process. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. It wasn't terrible, just not great. \u00a0For my main dish I chose the Chargrilled Salmon with caper and dill mayo. This dish redeemed the lackluster soup. Deliciously moist grilled salmon flaky and cooked perfectly served with a side of caper and dill mayo. I'm not normally a fan of mayos and mayo type sauces but this one was not too heavy and had a great vinegary tang from the capers and a freshness from the dill that complemented the salmon nicely.The service was efficient and prompt, but not the most personable. The overall ambiance of the restaurant and the salmon dish kept this a 3 star, the meh soup and \"cold\" service perhaps a 2.5. If I lived in the area would I come here again? Yes. The food was good, just need a few more smiles.",

Staff were friendly and we only waited 5 minutes to be seated as we didn't want to be by the window. We ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee. The breakfast menu hasn't got much variety for those that don't like eggs like my boyfriend but we asked for a English breakfast muffin with bacon and no egg which they were happy to do. I had scrambled egg on toast. The portion sizes are tiny however some of the other breakfast options I saw other people order seemed to be more satisfying so if I go back I will be sure to add something more filling. Never the less it was a nice bite to eat in a cute place. Will try the fresh cakes next time, maybe afternoon tea or try the lunch.",

    "text": "Arranging to meet a colleague in London's museum quarter, I tiredly stumble into the first place I come to, folksy new brunch and lunch place, Muriel's Kitchen.Named after some venture capitalist's grandmother (who obviously had a smart eye for a roll out and a chain concept). It's as British as only South Kensington can be, like a plastinated theme park recreation of a fictionalised remembrance of a bucolic rose tinted past. See also Irish pubs in airports and Michael Gove's education policy.The look goes for Farrow and Ball country kitchen, the menu farmer's market chic. If there's a limit to the number of times they can reference fresh and local and 'fun' I can't find it. It's been designed by a focus group consisting of the wives of Tory grandees and former prison guards.The staff are joyless and borderline scary as they contemplate table turn and space yield in a way that would impress the most ruthless of bankers. We're all crammed in closely and efficiently despite the space being less than half filled. I pitied the poor sods who followed after me and, unhappy with their allocated seating at the apex of two, cold windows attempted to move. \"All of the chairs are assigned to a table... Please don't move them. No, no. Those tables are for four people only\". This is 'fun'... with deliberate quotation marks.Despite that oh so jolly treatment, the food genuinely isn't that bad. My cheese omelette was borderline undercooked (in true French style) but fresh, light and creamy with a good hit of sharp cheese. The chutney alongside is just as I remember from my mother's WI days. Poached eggs are blisteringly golden, melting across acres of blushing toast that crunches with seedy goodness. Only anaemic coffee lets it down, I could be taking the line on parsimony too far but it tastes like the second time the beans have been used.It's generally a fine breakfast, with fine ingredients, albeit for a fairly 'fine' price. As it is removed we are upsold more tea, coffee or additional pasties. Declining, we are immediately presented with the bill and practically cleared with the table. Despite a decent breakfast, sometimes you remember why eating out is not just about the food...",

We really enjoyed the food but the service was lacking. I received a glass of wine with several flies in it and it took forever to call a waitress over. The wine was replaced by the manager who was apologetic. The food was very nice, especially the lasagne. Later when the bill arrived we saw that we were overcharged and had to dispute the charges with the waitress. The manager eventually came over again and was very professional, helpful, and sorted out the bill. Later that week my sister and I returned since it was one of the first joy restaurants open late and had a different waiter originally who was very attentive and got us our food quickly. But his shift must have ended and the waitress from the other night came with the bill and once again attempted to over charge us. She claimed to have mistakenly read the bill wrong and reluctantly handed our change back when we showed her the correct amount on the bill. We were very irritated with her attitude and attempts to get a few more pounds out of us.",

    "text": "It's really a shame that despite the nice food and atmosphere, that Muriel's seemingly cares little about how slow the service is. I mean, I get it... It's extremely busy most times of the day but it's not exactly like there's a whole lot of cooking that needs to be done. Many meals are simply popped in the microwave with most visits taking an hour, more or less. Today I had to show myself to a table because the waiter could not be bothered to do so. Maybe they're understaffed or just poorly staffed, but one thing is for certain, I'm not waiting an hour for microwaved food. Completely unacceptable. I likely won't be back, but it probably won't matter to anyone since I'm pretty sure they make more money on tourist traffic than they do retaining regulars. Sad state of affairs.",

The fish pie was tasteless and hard to even finish. The salmon was nothing I couldn't prepare better my self at home and came with a few salad leaves and chilli sauce. If you come here, best opt for the snackable dishes instead of forking out on the less than average mains.",

I ordered the Muriel Popeye: sourdough with a fried egg and bacon...did not get the baked beans but instead got a side of guacamole for an extra 3.50 which was well worth the extra pounds!My friend got the tumeric latte which had quite the kick to it & could've used some sugar. She also got the grilled halloumi and roasted tomato toast which she enjoyed. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in London.",

And they got it. The waiter stood 2 feet away from the line of 10 people, no explanations to the rest of us who had been waiting 15-20 minutes. We found this absolutely rude. Nevertheless, we stayed in line and got seated about 10 minutes later. We were quickly asked if we wanted still or sparkling water... with no mention that it would be \u00a34!

I took my little girl here as a European vacation. I was raised in London and I haven't been back since I was a child.Two men greeted us when we entered and offered us a stool that was too tall for my child, so he gave us the option of a regular table and we took it. I had a weird feeling because a lot of time passed and both men kept looking over and we were clearly being ignored from that point on. We are American and I don't know if that had anything to do with it? Sadly, my roots are British and this was a poor example of their hospitality. About 30 minutes passed and still no drink order, not even water. I understand that European service is slow at times, so I was waiting patiently. But when people all around us that literally just walked in were getting drink orders and meal orders, I started feeling it was more than likely intentional, especially when our menus were clearly on the table and they had made eye contact several times. At that point, we opted to leave but informed the female at the front desk beforehand and she seemed thankfully concerned.Not a very good example of what a restaurant should exhibit in a place that is clearly central to a lot of tourists. We ate at Pappa Roma down the street instead. The food was exceptional and the service exemplary.As a side note, not all Americans voted for Trump. Not all Americans support the things that have been going on for quite some time. We are thinking people as well, with hearts just as deep.",

    "text": "I could eat here every week. \u00a0Well, frankly, I've been here four times in the last two weeks. The service is always fantastic. Even when they have been packed, they are attentive and with a smile, asking if everything is okay, asking if they can get you something else. \u00a0I highly suggest:chocolate croissantblueberry muffinpopeye breakfastfresh juicestomato roasted red pepper soupbaked haloumi with scrambled eggsThey have wifi and lots of seating. And every dish I have had there has been served with an attention to food quality and interesting flavors. I have one thing, that's just personal, which is that I love smashed avocados with eggs on toast. Their's is almost perfect. For the life of me I can't figure out why they'd drizzle honey over it. For me, eggs and toast and avocado are savory items. In California, this is a common dish, so opposite of sweet that we actually put flaked salt on it in large pieces. \u00a0The honey on this dish is so off-putting for me. I had to send it back. \u00a0They didn't offer another dish or to refund my meal because as the waitress said \"it has honey listed on the menu.\" \u00a0True. It does. And it's gross. \u00a0But everything else is so perfect that I can't even fault them for what I think is an odd recipe. I'm still giving them five stars for their super friendly service, their great food, and their attention to quality. I want to try their milkshakes next!",

I was lucky enough to snag a small table right away. The staff is busy busy busy but super friendly and courteous despite some of the appalling treatment from customers I witnessed.My order came out quickly, to my surprise. With an absolutely packed restaurant I expected quite the wait. The eggs benedict were quite good, not the best I've ever had but certainly in the top ten. My carrot ginger juice was way too gingery for my taste though. I asked them if I could get a less spicy version and they were very nice about it and made me a fresh one with less ginger. The food was okay overall, I'm giving a high rating for the service though! Especially in busy, popular places the service can really suffer, but this place has it down!",

I had halloumi and baked tomatoes on toast, topped with perfect poached eggs. I added bacon on the side but the meal would have been equally delicious as a vegetarian option. My partner had the full English breakfast and gave a glowing review of the eggs. They use organic eggs and you can taste the difference. To drink I had a carrot and ginger smoothie which I thoroughly enjoyed and a coconut latte after my meal. I'm a huge fan of all things coconut and the latte was thoroughly delicious. We will definitely be back, especially on seeing how good the lunch and dinner menus look. The best thing is that all the prices are rather reasonable for the area.",

So per chance I was going to be in South Kensington early this morning so decided to pay it visit before the restaurant filled up!The first thing you notice is that the decor is homey and quirky. The upside-down colander light shades, the upside down pot plants all contribute to a loving and comfortable atmosphere. The breakfast is good, the sausages were awesome but the toast not so much. After my breakfast I spent most of my time eyeing other people's breakfast, in particular the Muriel's Breakfast Sandwich and the Blueberry Pancakes looked delicious so I might have had a teeny bit of food envy!Last but not least... I loved the plates, they should probably consider selling 'em!",

We did, however, have dinner and let me tell you, we could not have been more satisfied with concluding our UK trip by having our last meal here. We still think about it because that's how much we enjoyed it!The flattened British sirloin steak was delicious, perfectly cooked and well seasoned. I only got a bite of it since my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it too much to share. I got the spicy chipotle beef & pork meatballs, which was equally delicious. Everything just worked. The rice complemented the meatballs so well, I cleaned the plate. In regards to the space, it was a bit small and tight. The guest sitting perpendicular to me would occasionally bump into me. To her defense, she was in no better position than myself in terms of space, so I didn't really mind. \u00a0Lastly, the service. We experienced great service throughout our entire meal. The waiter, whose name I do not know or remember, was so lovely. He was very helpful in assisting us, especially me, with our meal choices. I could sense that he was very busy waiting on many full tables but he always came around at the perfect time to check up on us and make sure we were happy with our dishes. That does not happen often.I will be back here again the next time I'm back in London to try their breakfast, beef lasagna and their carrot cake!",

Majlinda took about 15 minutes to take our order and then promptly FORGOT to place it into the system. We waited an additional 20 minutes before we noticed the table next to us who was seated and ordered after us received their food. Then, the other server who was not even responsible for us noticed we had been sitting there so long there was no way we hadn't received our food yet. Cue an apologetic Majlinda who tried to make it right by bringing us a some water and complementary coffee. However, we were shocked to find we were charged \u00a34 for that water and we only received it shortly before we had finished our food. When we brought this up to her, she told us that we had to learn and we should have specified tap water before she brought it. I have never received such condescending attitude from a service professional, let alone one that is so terrible at their job. However, the food and other staff were great, which is why I didn't leave a one star review.",

The South Kensington location is right next to a Tube stop and within spitting distance of the museums, making this an easy stop for tourists looking to grab an avocado toast during siteseeing.My boyfriend and I stopped in for bite in the late morning on a weekday, and we were lucky to grab a seat as it was quite busy. Seating is tight and, despite the light and airy decor, it can feel a bit stressful as the servers bustle around trying to keep the hordes happy.I had avocado toast with sunny side up eggs (9.50 pounds), which had a disappointingly thin layer of avocado but was otherwise good and filling, with nice runny yolks. My boyfriend did the Muriel's Popeyes with sausage (11.50 pounds), which is basically egg-in-a-hole with the beans and meat components of an English breakfast. Good stuff, huge portion.We rounded this off with a good cappuccino (around 3 pounds), though we weren't able to flag down a waiter to get water. It's a cute spot and the prices aren't awful. I'd consider tacking this on to plans if in the area, but I'd look into other restaurants if you're looking for a more relaxed brunch experience.",

Meanwhile half of the many tables with normal seating arw empty. \u00a0It is not lunchtime, so it is not so full. \u00a0I respect that coming just for coffee is lower value than a full meal. \u00a0However they told me of the seating issue only after I had ordered the coffee and was going to the seating. \u00a0It bills itself as a cafe as well as restaurant, so I should go to another cafe or coffee shop, where I can sit in normal parts of the place.The coffee is undoubtably very good quality and that is worth paying for. However it is a small serving.As a result of the seating, I will probably go elsewhere next time and without that I would have come back to try it for food. \u00a0Sadly my long term goodwill has been eroded.",

We sat at a counter facing outside, which wasn't bad if you like to people watch. Strike 2: I ordered an English breakfast light and was told they stop serving the light version at 10am, but serve the full English Breakfast all day(?). I was kind of disappointed so I ordered Grilled Halloumi and Roasted Tomatoes( I couldn't eat the tomatoes, the cheese was chewy) I ate the egg and toast leaving hungry.

My bacon was crispy just the way I like it - they also use Organic Clarence eggs - the runny yolk was perfect! I asked for water not knowing I'd get a bottle of water - for visitors make sure you ask for tap! My americano was amazing and prices were fair - I'd like to come back to check out thei lunch menu. Unfortunately, they no longer serve Scotch Eggs :(",

Finally after realizing we noticed what she did, she told us there was a \"small table available and by the bathroom.\" By then we just wanted to be seated and eat since we were in a rush so we took the \"only\" available table. Service was mediocre. \u00a0I got the Buddha bowl which was decent, my friend got the English breakfast which was just ok-nothing special.

    "text": "This place is located right outside of South Kensington tube station so I like to pop in here on my way to work and grab a breakfast english muffin sandwich and a cappuccino. I'm picky about my cappuccinos and find that most places simply do not make them properly, but Muriel's does and I am grateful for that. I usually get the egg and bacon english muffin sandwich- the egg is so warm and fluffy. It makes such a stand out difference from other places because their food is made fresh on the premises and you can taste that in every dish. I've had their chicken pot pie, which hits the spot- the chicken is made with dark flavorful meat and the pie is perfectly flaky. It's quite cozy for being a busy cafe next to a tube station, but it's well decorated and a lot of thought has gone into making the place feel like a country home kitchen right in the middle of London. Although the other reviews are upset about the service, and I agree it can be slow and inefficient at times, but honestly this is my experience at basically every cafe I've been to in London and I find the staff here to be very sweet and the management really puts effort and love into what they do, and that is what matters to me. I don't care if I have to wait a bit for service because the product is good and once a server does come around, they are nothing but kind.",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. \u00a0Standalone, easy dining, brunch places are few and far between. In the UK, chain restaurants rule. The decor is great, bright, cheerful and country-twee: Just the sort of place you'd want to have brunch in on a sunny Saturday. The brunch menu is full of solid choices like eggs benedict/florentine/royale, English muffins with scrambled eggs and bacon, full English, eggs on toast, boiled eggs and asparagus spears. \u00a0The ingredients are well-sourced and good. \u00a0It is even priced fairly for the location (in theory, anyway, see following) with the eggs benny at \u00a37 and full English at \u00a37.50. \u00a0The full English is good value for what you get: sausage, two rashers bacon, beans, black pudding, tomato, toast and eggs. Properly abundant. \u00a0In stark contrast, however, the eggs benedict (at only 50p cheaper) was a split muffin with one thin slice of ham draped forlornly over both muffin sides, a poached egg on each and a teaspoon of hollandaise plopped on the top of each. Save to say my boyfriend tucked into half my full English to supplement his meal. \u00a0The freshly squeezed OJ was indeed freshly squeezed (as opposed to freshly squeezed out of a carton, which is what a lot of restaurants do) and the cappuccini good enough. \u00a0As one reviewer already pointed out: no soy milk available, which is a gross oversight in this day and age. \u00a0A warning: if you like your proper Heinz tommy K and HP you'll be in for a disappointment as they only have chichi wilkes&sons ketchup and brown sauce -- passable but why mess with a good thing, I ask?? \u00a0So all in all the food was pretty good.  Oh, but the service...WHAT SERVICE!? \u00a0Servers running all over the place like headless chickens, each 'assigned' sections even though the restaurant is the size of my living room. \u00a0We more-or-less seated ourselves and waited... And waited... And waited. \u00a0Eventually, a server gave us menus. \u00a0 When we were ready we summoned her again but she said, \"Oh, I'll just get your server.\" Eh? \u00a0So we ordered from OUR server. \u00a0Drinks were served fairly promptly. \u00a0The diner next to me got her eggs royale: along with guest hair. The lady complained to the server that she had asked for hollandaise on the side (in my head I was thinking: \u00a0Lady, you got bigger problems than that) and the server told her that if she wanted that she'd have to wait another fifteen minutes; she declined. \u00a0I digress. \u00a0When my boyfriend's and my food arrived I asked the (different again) server for brown sauce. \"Brown?\" \"yes, brown sauce\" \"brown...brown sugar?\" \"no sauce, brown sauce... BROWN SAUCE\" \"ok, I ask.\" We got our sauces in the end -- see above. The frustration of the diners was palpable. \u00a0As I wrote at the beginning of this review: I really want to love this place. \u00a0I really do......But I don't. \u00a0The owner, Ms Noble, seriously needs to sort her management out because they are not doing this place justice. \u00a0Too many schoolboy (or girl, lets not be sexist here) errors. The staff ought to have a basic command of the English language and they need to get organised (and not eat in behind the deli counter in full view of customers). \u00a0I also note that there is no address on their website. \u00a0What a rudimentary oversight.Yeah, and they need to wear hairnets or something in the kitchen. \u00a0Maybe I should've pointed the hair out to my adjacent diner, as act of good citizenship. \u00a0It's been weighing upon my mind all day...",

Oh, and when the check came, the chips were still on it!Overall, if you want over-priced, microwaved food, with poor service, then have at it, but I would never come here again.",

Then I saw the microwave and sevond guessed my decision to eat there but was so hungry I put my hesitation aside. My delight dwindled further when I heard the vegetables were coated in double cream. I ordered the minestrone soup and quinoa salad. The soup was just ok, certainly no better than eating the tinned version. The quinoa salad had no dressing or flavour whatsoever. Luckily they had Tabasco which went someway towards making it edible.",
