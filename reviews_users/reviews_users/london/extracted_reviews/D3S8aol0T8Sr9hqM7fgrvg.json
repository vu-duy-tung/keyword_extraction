I was short on time, did my walking from place to place, and just felt that I was losing out on time. \u00a0 \u00a0I got lost using the Tube and ended up coming up at Oxford to find myself finally sitting down for a sandwich. \u00a0I avoided sitting down at all the whole day (except while on the Tube) and only stopped because \u00a0I no longer had the energy to walk. \u00a0This place rocks with organically grown vegetables and stuff. \u00a0Their salads (Greek) was yummy and VERY fresh. \u00a0Their cookies were sinfully yet good enough to eat without terrible regrets :) \u00a0Their fruit juice selection was huge which I chose Mango something.The selection is huge and compared to Whole Foods' offering, it is much cheaper (to USA's version). \u00a0 I noticed there is a WHOLE FOODS in London but did not care to visit.They have bar stools and tables inside but the outside had 4 tables. The only down side was that i had to inhale the secondary smoke from neighboring tables. \u00a0That is just me.",

But the sammys here are fresh, delicious, and affordable (for UK terms). I went to Pret a Manger a few times while i was in London and their sandwiches were all good. Even the seafood one I got (crawfish) was good and not fishy tasting. Ahh I'm salivating for a sandwich from them now. They make their sandwiches, salads, wraps, etc. all fresh and the only thing that can make them better would be to have one in CA (I'm thinking downtown SF would be a good place no?)",

The food is extremely fresh, delish and well priced. There's a reason it's full of Londoners eating! Whenever we're in the UK and it's lunchtime, no matter where we are, if there's a Pret around you can find us there! From hot & cold sandwiches to soup, salads, pastries, coffe & tea, you just can't go wrong. A must place for a quick lunch. Forget the burger places...you can go there in the states...be British...eat at Pret!",

Pret a manger ('Ready To Eat') is a chain which prides themselves for producing 'natural handmade food with no added preservatives or additives'. They provide customers with a wide range of food which caters to all sorts of taste buds: Sandwiches (such as Scottish smoked salmon with lemon juice to falafel, spinach & tomato), daily soups (lentil and bacon, sag-aloo, Thai chicken curry) , baguettes, hot wraps, sushi (surprisingly good), and salads. They also do a decent selection of cakes (the banana card box cake is pretty good), desserts and a range of baked goods such as croissants and muffins. In addition to food they do 'Just Roasted' coffees, teas, hot chocolates and juices. I wish the prices were a little cheaper, but the quality isn't bad, so all in all I would say they did pretty good 'fast food'.",

The whole thing came to about \u00a37 though which is a little steep. Despite the sandwich being a bit cold and soggy, it went really well with the soup which was piping hot, really filling and creamy. There isn't waiter service as this is a place to grab a quick lunch, so pay at the counter and bring it to the table yourself. This isn't McDonald's though so you're not expected to clean up after yourself too! It can be manic at lunchtime so try going at about 3pm, some of the good stuff will be sold out but the soup usually stays around till then and at least you'll get a seat.",

All of the conveniences of the world cannot mask the English crave of mayo. 95% of all the products there are lathered in mayo, seriously. Otherwise they definately would have gotten another star.

Pret has started to serve soy latte's and at a better price that you can find at costa or starbucks but just the same quality product and even speedier service.

The barristas/servers are funny and friendly - which is pretty amazing given their location just above Oxford Tube station and on the High Street.

I'm sure this is directly related to gastral-intestinal-distressing truck stop sandwiches... None the less, I was talked into giving them a chance. Decided to start at a Pret a Manger. They can be found pretty much on every other block in central London. Probably should have started easier (BLT, egg salad, etc.), but opted for wild crawfish on wheat bread with mayo, lemon juice, and arugula. A bit of a revelation. It was very late in the day, but the sandwich tasted fresh and well-seasoned. Very good - I'm now a convert!",

Anything that's left, they give to homeless shelters. The soups were fabulous (I had tomato basil, an Indian soup, a bean soup and one other I can't recall). The sandwiches are large and filling. And, there's free-wi-fi (though I couldn't find any plugs for my computer). Pret's are all over London now, can't wait to go back.",

Pret do all sorts of yummy varieties and takes on classic favourites. I do like the generous salads if I am being healthy, although they seem to have stopped the tuna nicose they have a new morrocan one out with houmous and falafel and other soul bettering foods. The Soups are a cheaper and filling option. OR the miso soup really does heal any illness and give you a bit of a boost.Pret is nice to just sit in and watch people pass by the window. And you can always pick up a pudding when you finish your sandwich, as I end up doing- the love bars or pecan pie is AMAZING. The prices are not so low, BUT what would you rather have- a hoisin duck wrap, a tea and a cheesecake or a triple whooper bacon extra cheese road to heart attack?",

The wrap itself has drastic room for improvement, but I suspect it depends on how long the sandwich has been sitting on the hot rack for. Because I am from California and consume large amounts of Mexican or Mediterranean food, I am critical of the quality of wraps. Pret A Manger will certainly suffice over other fast food alternatives. However, brace yourself for lines and limited seating during rush hours. Luckily, there are armfuls of Pret A Mangers located throughout London.",

All of its sandwiches are handmade in-store and consists of an interesting variety that extends far beyond turkey with mayo. My favorite sandwich is the Chicken-Avocado with yogurt sauce.. mmmmmmm. I must mention that all of the sandwiches are made ahead of time and placed out in boxes minutes before they are bought.. I'm pretty sure you can customize them if that is your desire though.There is an pre-made sandwich epidemic in London and every cafe, bar, and restaurant seems to have hopped on the bandwagon. Pret, however, is a cut above the rest and will remain my favorite sandwich place in London.",

The mozzarella and tomato croissants were delicious and not too cheesy. But the real winner in my book were the chocolate croissants. They're filled with a surprisingly large amount of chocolate inside of them. With each bite you got a taste of real cocoa with your fluffy croissant. They have something called a babyccino which is basically a cappucino minus the coffee for kids. It's free and in a very small cup. The cappuccino here was delicious and went very well with my croissants in the morning. Pret A Manager was definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast in London.

    "text": "I love this place for what it is: a quick place to get salads/sandwiches/lunch item-type foods when you're in a hurry. They have a great selection of different salads, sandwiches, etc. for those who are on the go. We were trying to catch the train to Nice and just needed something to eat for the train ride. This was perfect. Also, the food is pretty good and hits the spot.",

    "text": "Really 3.5 star, but I'm in a generous, rounding up sort of mood. Predictable. Reliable. Words that, in my youth, I negatively used to describe used cars and unwanted suitors. I wanted new, exciting, explosive experiences every. time. I. ate (or dated). Now that I've aged, my preferences have changed. I'm not trying to roll the damn dice every time I get a sandwich. To that end, Pret a Manager is like a nice Ford Taurus- Pret a Manger is consistently reliable and pretty good. \u00a0You want a particular sandwich, you come here and you get the same thing , each and every time. They're pretty darn tasty too.",

    "text": "I have three words for you.... Cheese And Pickle This is BY FAR the best sandwich on the planet & Pret A Manger serves it up right For those not in the know (USA), Pret offers shelves & shelves of packed sandwiches......but they are FRESHLY made & ready to go. \u00a0Get your regular \u00a0fav lunch sandwich & get out the door that much quicker b/c your delish sandwich is already madeAmericans tend to have this preconceived notion that anything already in the triangle packaging must be old, moldy & terrible......hear me now! \u00a0This is not the case w/ PretWhether on sliced bread or a baguette, you will find the below yummiliscious fillings: Mature Cheddar Cheese Branston Pickle Watercress If you're lucky, you'll also get sun-dried tomatoes like I had on my baguette today & that just kicks it up a notch Pret also makes their own Crisps & I can highly recommend the Cheddar & Onion Super-crispy & tons of cheesy flavor w/ none of that MSG we Americans tend to put in all our bags of chips Three cheers for Pret A Manger & it's best three-ingredient sandwich!!",

    "text": "I asked my hotel manager for a casual place to eat that was not a chain thinking he was going to tell me to go to Mc Donalds. \u00a0Well...he told me to go to Pret a Manger ...while is a chain...he said there food is very good and they give anything they don't sell at the end of the day to the homeless...sounds cool.You go in and there are open refrigerators that have all different kinds of sandwiches mostly baguette. At lunch, they have hot wraps too. \u00a0You bring your selection to the counter where you can also purchase soup, coffee, or tea. \u00a0They have a take away and eat in price. \u00a0The price to take it away is about 50 pence less per item than eating in. \u00a0 Genius!! \u00a0 I never had to find a table even during the busy lunch hour...I had the Thai Chili Chicken which was delish... \u00a0It's like chicken salad with Sweet Thai Chili sauce. \u00a0The baguette that the chicken is housed in is VERY fresh and with a slight crisp outside. \u00a0It really reminded me of a Banh Mi. \u00a0The price was under 3 pounds. \u00a0They also make yummy breakfast baguettes. \u00a0I had the egg and bacon. \u00a0And the egg is basically egg salad. \u00a0Thought that was weird but it tasted pretty good. \u00a0 One morning I did stop in hoping to grab some lunch stuff for an all day bus tour but they don't sell the lunch till later...A few days into my London trip, and I realize this place is like Starbucks is to Seattle. \u00a0You will not have trouble finding one or several in close proximity. They are all about using local in season ingredients, they donate to the homeless and they are OCD about recycling (will see signs on the wall everywhere). \u00a0Really wish there was one of these in the US. \u00a0Highly recommend!! \u00a0Well ..not really because you'll probably end up there anyways...lol.",

    "text": "I frequented Pret quite a lot when i lived in London and was working due to my short lunch breaks and the fact we would eat in the office because I could grab what I wanted quickly and it always was very fresh and I had a lot of choices. It never seemed like fast food and there was always something really tasty. I really enjoyed the brie sandwich with tomatoes? I think that is what it had in it, possibly with basil.They also had several soup options which I quite frequently chose as well along with a small salad. I really never had anything from Pret that I didn't like. My only complaint was that so many of the sandwiches had mayo on them which I am not a huge fan of but I got over it. I would try and take some off or just pick ones that didn't have any on it. Pret was definitely one of the most affordable options as I always got food out during my lunch breaks (lazy I know but my schedule was hectic!) and it was easy to pick something healthy and yummy. They also have healthy snacks like fresh fruit, dried fruit, snack bars, etc., which were easy to grab if if I was starving before jumping on the tube.",
