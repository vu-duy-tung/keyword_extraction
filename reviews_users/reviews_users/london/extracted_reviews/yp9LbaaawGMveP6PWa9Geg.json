They have so many kinds, I couldn't resist!The food is a little pricey, but that's understandable since the quality is very good and the service is friendly. Will definitely be back to Bea's for tea some time.",

    "text": "The cakes and sweets in the Afternoon Tea are nice but I feel overall it's a victim of its own success. Too little staff \u00a0to cope with how busy it gets and too much confusion. We made a reservation, we were seated, asked if we were here for the afternoon tea (we were), asked what tea we'd like, and it was all served. This gave the impression of table service. We waited to be asked if we'd like more tea or for the bill. In the end we had to go to the counter to ask for these things. When I queried them on this later, they informed me that they're too busy to offer a table service. That'd be fine if that was made clear to us (a simple \"If you want anything else, please come to the counter\" would have sufficed, when we were served the tea.) There is a slight assumption that you've been before and you know what to expect. Overall this made me feel quite embarrassed that I had not known it was counter service, rather than table service.Unfortunately, I'll give this place a miss in the future. \u00a0Maybe one day I'll pop in to buy a cupcake to take away but that'll be it.",

    "text": "I entertained a friend this weekend, and she was eager to experience afternoon tea in London. Being students, we were interested in something slightly more affordable than the afternoon teas offered by the fancier establishments. Bea's offered three levels of afternoon tea, ranging from 9 quid to 21 (if i remember correctly). The scones were delicious, and the waiters working there were friendly and accommodating with the variety of requests made by our five person group. The only reason I give four stars and not five was that most of the cakes offered involved peanut butter, and though I love all things peanut butter, my friend is not a fan, and was thus unable to enjoy a number of the desserts.",

    "text": "It's businesses like Bea's that are putting Bloomsbury back on the map. Even a few years ago, Bloomsbury was a very overlooked area, but you'd be foolish to overlook it now. This wasn't my first trip to Bea's, since I live a few minutes walk away I can pop in whenever I want. The only thing holding me back from doing that is having no one to go with (so lonely!). You see, Bea's is best enjoyed with a special someone - either close friends or that extra special someone. You could go on your own, but that's a slippery slope towards cake addiction! You have been warned! There's a few tables outside and inside is very nice, but today I want to talk to you about picnics! Bloomsbury is a great area for public open spaces that are perfect for picnics. Given the lovely spell of weather we've been having recently - Bea's afternoon tea picnic offer was an offer I couldn't refuse. For the same price as their regular sweet afternoon tea (\u00a39.90 per person), Bea's will provide you with a full picnic set to take where you please for the afternoon. We're not talking plastic cups here - it's a proper wicker picnic basket. complete with metal cutlery, ceramic plates and tea cups, plus a handy bottle opener! (should you like to take a bottle of something along with you). You just need to leave a credit card or some ID with them until you return the basket. The tea consists of a handmade scone, clotted cream and jam in little pots, a handmade cupcake, a mini Valrhona brownie, a mini Belgian Blondie, and a mini meringue. With the picnic set you also get a thermos of hot water and some tea bags of your choice. We also added some delicious mini baguettes at \u00a33 per person. All the food was perfect! Just the right amount for an afternoon and the right balance of richness so as not to be too full-on. The cupcakes were fantastic! Other highlights were the meringue and the mini baguettes, which were unexpectedly good and full of flavour. The only teeny negatives were that there thermos was a bit leaky (but lovely staff who put together our picnic did warn us). The other was that there were no napkins, but we got by. When you compare Bea's to the cost of a coffee and an inferior cake from a high street coffee chain, it's a bit of a bargain! Sure you could just go to Tesco and come away with a lot more food for the same money, but Bea's is special. You can tell that it's fresh, and made by really skilled people, and that no corners have been cut when it comes to the quality of ingredients. I'd highly recommend anyone to go to Bea's normally, but the picnic offer is really a 6-Star experience! We had a lovely afternoon that really would be hard to beat!",

I should note that there's a disconnect between the great food and ambiance of the place: the food is delicious, but the interior decor could be better. I suppose,though, that with such reasonable prices, one cannot complain. For 5 pounds if you're dining in (and only 3 pounds for take-out!) you get a small plate of three food options. They have different selections every day. You feel good knowing everything is prepared fresh, and the food is really great!",

I was surprised by how little I get for the price, but I guess it has to be worth it for it to be so popular. I first started with the scone, it was very crumbly and buttery, and if it was warmed, it would have tasted even better, but unfortunately, it is too good on it's own and makes the clotted cream redundant. coincidentally, clotted cream is my favourite component of afternoon tea, so I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to enjoy it.The best part of the oreo cupcake was the oreo cookie on top of it. the icing was too hard and the cupcake itself tasted like a normal pound cake that I could make myself. It tasted exactly like ones I had made - the ones that convinced me I wasn't a good baker at all. The fudges were equally as unimpressive. They were dense and floury, and I could hardly taste the white chocolate flavour in the white chocolate fudge. Even the standard chocolate one didn't taste like much. It was just floury. The coconut meringue and raspberry marshmallow were ok, but by that time, I was already too thoroughly disappointed to enjoy them.",

There were supposedly three types of sandwiches but two of them were very similar so not very varied. Place is cute but very small with limited table space. The younger waitress was very pleasant but the older one was cold and very curt, definitely a turnoff. Finally a tea service charge was added to the cost of the afternoon tea - this is in addition to the 15% overall service charge!! - which is not mentioned anywhere on their site, seems wrong if they do not mention up front. Would I recommend? Probably not., I think I'd try a different one if the price were similar.",

We made a reservation for two by e-mail and I got very quick and friendly answers from the staff. The afternoon tea menu consisted of 2 different cupcakes, 2 scones with clotted cream and (I think it was raspberry but it might be strawberry) preserve, 2 mini Valrhona chocolate brownies, 2 mini blondies and 4 mini marshmallows, and of course a pot of tea (blackcurrant and hibiscus for me) or coffee (my boyfriend had a macchiato). Everything was very nice and I think the price is quite good, \u00a39.90, given the quality and the quantity of the food! I loved the place, it's tiny and cosy and you can see the kitchen from the table. It gives you a feeling of really artisan and home made. Yesterday they had cardboard boxes everywhere (I guess because they don't have much storage space in the shop) with packed cupcakes ready to be transported to the Taste of London festival. Some might think that it's a kind of unprofessional detail or whatever like that, but for me, it was just the touch of very small and lovely, special and of indeed successful business. It's a pity that I live rather far from the place and it's very unusual for me to be around that area of London, but if I happend to be near some day I will certainly stop there and buy something. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place.",

I really wanted to love Bea's afternoon tea, so I think my expectations may have been a little high. There were six of us for afternoon tea and as other reviewers have said the price is competitive for afternoon tea - \u00a319 \u00a0per person - which is quite good for a tea in London. It however was not the best. The scones were lovely, the sandwiches OK although we were surprised (we were a greedy group) to find that there were an allocated number per person, as opposed to unlimited sandwiches like at some other tea places. The most disappointing thing about the tea was the lack of cake variety, Bea's offers lots of lovely and delicious cakes, but the tea includes a cupcake and three little squares of chocolate brownie types. The greedy person in me and the cake lover in me hoped for a little more cake variety and maybe one square of brownie and something different would have been nice. So overall Bea's does an OK afternoon tea, it ticks all the tea boxes, but a few small changes may have made it even better.",

    "text": "Bea's is very cute little place to meet for afternoon tea, although there are some kinks. My friend made a reservation but appeared to have been missed off the list when we arrived. Fortunately there was some outside seating available, although it's not especially comfortable even on a sunny day. The tea was lovely and we shared a selection of their cakes which were brilliant - of particular note was the passion fruit marshmallow and the chocolate and raspberry cupcakes. Another friend ordered a red velvet cupcake and received a free one when the waitress forgot to bring it out which was kind, but most of the staff seemed rather dismissive and distracted. The inside is very small so not ideal on a cold or wet day as it gets very packed. A good place to meet if you're in the area but not especially worth going out of your way for.",

    "text": "A lovely afternoon tea experience. I called in to book afternoon tea the day-of, a couple hours before I intended to visit. They were very accommodating and took my reservation. The place was clearly busy when I arrived but my table was ready and Hamid was attentive. Everything I tasted was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the sandwiches, which were a nice alternative to the standard white bread finger sandwiches typically served with afternoon tea. The sweets were very delectable. My tea came with a mango cupcake, which I loved even though I rarely like fruit flavored cake. The brownies were wonderful and moist; I may have to revisit just to pick up some brownies. Their dessert case also had other tempting treats which I hope to try at some point. I recommend this afternoon tea spot - tasty food, fun location, good service.",

Beas is one of those stops, a necessary tea and pastry stop in the overwhelmed business school world I now call my life.I love that they offer afternoon tea, that they have sugar bowls on every table.I love the cupcakes, including the blue cookie monster ones on Halloween which dyed my mouth blue.I love the pastries, fluffy and light, or decadent and too-rich-for-breakfast (but perfect for curing a mid-class hangover).I love the Thanksgiving dinner, offering us expats a welcome taste of home with friendly service and a good price.I've obviously celebrated holidays at Beas. I trust them to give me good food when I most miss things from home. The atmosphere is quirky yet so comfortable that I love to pop in. I certainly have no plans of stopping my tea and pastry study breaks and meetings now.",

    "text": "I contemplated if I should give a rating here as the ONLY reason for them is their red velvet cupcakes. So yelpers... this is a review of their red velvet cupcakes and NOTHING else.Now that we have that out of the way... I can move on to the good part. The red velvet cupcakes (YES!). Since I moved from New York to London, I have been on a quest to find the perfect red velvet. In doing so I have kissed many a frogs (or worse actually), may it be in road side bakeries (which use whipped cream to frost the one cupcake where EVERYTHING is in the frosting!) to the elites like Lola's (decent RV's) and Hummingbird (sadly, a huge disappointment for that one flavor at least). Then, a friend brought us these and even though I had a tiny bite, tears gushed through my eyes. Its not new york, but the soft and mildly sweet cream cheese frosting sits so well with the red colored normal cake! it was a christmas miracle. Therefore we hiked up this place (me and other fellow ex newyorkers suffering from red velvet withdrawals) to get ourselves one! The place is really small and so we couldn't find a seat. Which sucked coz it was cold and wet outside. So if you want to enjoy the cake over a warm cuppa... maybe reserve in advance? Thats also why I gave them a star less (coz the cupcakes get 5 stars), as they are a bit too small for a decent sized cafe. But the cupcakes were great! and I am dreaming of another box that I might soon get (new years diet be damned!)",

The first time there was no setting option (just take away), since they were painting the walls. So I did not go in :S. The second time, it was a bank holiday, so they were closed. the third time, I cam with full eagerness to try Bea's and I ready did it this time ... Hooray :) The coffee was good, pastries are nice, I was waining for something to surprise me in this place, I was waiting for some good half an hour or so .. and suddenly the cub cakes came to the seen ... Traaaa! so I asked about the cub cakes and it was 'red velvets' .. yummy .. so I ordered one and it was hmmm very good, a bit dry but still very good .. to be honest, I loved the icing more than the cake . So coffee and cake was (very) good and we are almost done. so I was wondering what does people (yelppers) like about this place ??? and suddenly I notice the magic bit of this place ... it's the baking area .. it is just so cute and happening all the time.. they are so busy preparing things from scratch .. so you feel like you are sitting in the kitchen while they are preparing your cake .. such a magical feeling that makes thinking of coming again.. The service was not that good at the beginning, but suddenly they start to smile and to be friendly .. I guess they noticed that I'm trying to check-in (yelp in iphone) :P The place is great, and worth a try!",

Poor Thomas W was very unlucky, but I have to say that I didn't try the cupcakes so I can't comment there. They do look beautiful though. I had a breakfast date with Larissa D here this morning before we both headed off to work. So at 8am we wondered in to be greeted by a lovely selection of tea's and some breakfast pastries. We settled on porridge but I think I was sold on the selection of toppings you could choose from, or in Larissa and mine cases, plonk ALL of them on! Cinnamon, sugar, coconut, honey, cold milk, dried fruits and nuts... it was a smorgasbord of delights.As if that wasn't enough they have a whole table (granted it was small! but still) coverd with a toaster, nutella, honey, jam, cream cheese, butter and marmite all ready and waiting to be used. We shared a cheese scone which was so lovely and soft inside and perfectly crumbly outside, I went to the little table with my half, toasted it, butter it and then gobbled it up. They served my favourite type of tea, which was in a pot but not the pretty pots with legs that I saw behind the counter which was a little disappointing. I couldn't leave without trying their coffee so I had a black one and was a little disappointed that it wasn't a filter but no worries as it was quite tasty and smooth. I'd have it again.Over all Bea's wins with me, I went on a quite morning and was greeted by friendly staff, who even let me use their loo (thank you ladies). If I'm in that area again, I shall pop in.",

    "text": "Considering that afternoon tea consists of tea and cake, the often exorbitant prices ranging up to \u00a3100 and sometimes more, are a little extreme in my opinion - and that's where the delightful Bea's of Bloomsbury comes in. You can get your daytime sugar fix and wash it down with a pot of tea (or a coffee if you wish) for a mere \u00a312 - and you won't be disappointed!I went with my fianc\u00e9, and each of our afternoon teas came with a scone (complete with clotted cream and jam), a cupcake (we had one chocolate with pistachio frosting and one vanilla with passion fruit frosting) a mini brownie, a mini blondie, a homemade passionfruit marshmallow, a mini meringue and some other little cakey thing (I can't remember what it was called!) - all yummy!This is a sweet afternoon tea, so no sarnies, and if it all sounds a bit too decadent, then you can go for the half option of just tea and a scone.We loved our afternoon tea - the scone was divine, the brownies were rich and dense, the cupcakes were great flavours and the meringues were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Yum. I am not a fan of marshmallows to begin with, and although this one was interesting in texture (bouncy to the touch!) and more flavourful than the usual kind, it was not really my thing.By the end of our tea I was stuffed! I spent the whole time we were in there admiring all the delicious looking sweets on the counter, and I can honestly say that by the end of it, I couldn't have eaten another thing, no matter how scrumptious it all looked!",

Although I don't really have anything to compare it to, I completely enjoyed my experience at this place. We had reservations so we were seated promptly when we walked in by our friendly and smiling waiter. \u00a0The tea was great because they had a wide selection and you receive your own tea pot. I had the English tea, while my friends sipped on Earl Grey and Green tea. You can ask for as much cream and sugar as you would like. As for the food, the scones with clotted cream were delicious, as were the mini sandwiches which included a variety between beef, turkey and tomato with mozzarella. I was so stuffed from those that we all took our cupcakes for take away, so we could eat them later. We also had some brownie bites, vanilla marshmallows and meringue. All were delicious and satisfying. The complete experience cost about 18 pounds. If you're ever in London and want some traditional afternoon tea, I would definitely recommend calling here to make a reservation!. However, there seemed to be plenty of open seats on the Wednesday afternoon that we stopped by, so you could also take your chances.",

    "text": "This is a review of the wedding consultation service. It took a few tries to get an appointment. I initially tried calling the St.Paul's branch to get a consultation there (It's far easier for me to get to than the bloomsbury branch).On the phone I was told that I needed to book a normal table and call them later. Luckily I didn't do this. I couldn't make the day I was originally looking at, so I instead called their events booking line.I was told the computer system was located in the office and that there was a meeting going on. I asked when I should call back and was told 'I don't know, try again in 20 minutes'. I called back 20 minutes later and was told that the meeting was still going on and to call back in half an hour.I did that and was told the computer system was down. So far, not a great experience.I ended up waiting a few days to call again. When I did I was told that the lady I needed to talk to was out of the office and I should call back later. Great.I finally after all this managed to speak to someone. I asked to have my consultation at St. Paul's and was told that they don't do consultations at St. Paul's, only at Bloomsbury. Which is fine. Just extremely annoying considering no one up to this point had mentioned that. Not even the staff at St Paul's.I finally managed to book in an appointment, and made my way to Bloomsbury. Man, I'm glad I did!They were extremely helpful, talking me through all the different types of cakes and finishes. They spent a good hour/hour and a half with my fianc\u00e9 and me.The end result of this is that I ordered my wedding cake from them. I love Bea's, and couldn't be happier that they are doing my cake. We got to try all the different flavours and discussed details I hadn't even thought of. They were extremely knowledgable and put me instantly at ease.If it wasn't for the multiple phone calls and issues booking in the first place, this would have been an instant 5* review. I was toying with 3*s because it really left a bad taste in my mouth even before I'd arrived. However, the stellar service they gave us pulled it back up to a 4.If you're planning on having a wedding cake, or any other special occasion I recommend Bea's. Just call the Bloomsbury store straight away.",

I had spotted it in a blog (a little Internet research about where to eat is always helpful) and I really wanted to go. I remember a very long walk down the road to find the place, I was actually quite tired but I didn't want to give up, I nearly missed it because it's very small but it was really worth the efforts ! The cupcakes were truly gorgeous. I have tried quite a few places and sometimes I find that cupcakes can be quite \"heavy\" in your stomach, too \"rich\", too sugary but the ones in Bea's are just perfect, really tasty but light ! The staff is really nice and helpful. There's another Bea's near St Paul's, which might be handier in terms of location. I went there last year and I loved it too.",

They even personalized a cupcake for my friend who was celebrating her birthday.I am telling all my friends to come visit this place before they leave London as it is a very vintage high tea experience.",

I was really excited about enjoying a proper British afternoon tea, but first of all the tea that was brought to me was totally subpar. I ordered the vanilla black. It came in barely hot water so it took for ever for the tea to take any \u00a0flavor and colour. I get this is a cafe and that's why you cannot expect attentive service, I guess. The sandwiches that came with the afternoon tea were not good. If I ever went back I would only get the scones and clotted cream. They were very good!",

My past successful choices have made me the choice person to select where we go on our meetups. I've typically opted for decent, inexpensive food with a good cocktail menu. This time, however, one of the group has a bun in the oven. My usual recipe for success was not going to work. I ummed and arred about what to do and then thought of afternoon tea. 'Excellent' I thought, until I saw that many of the London spots charge \u00a350 a head. Way out of our budget.Then I found Bea's of Bloomsbury. Very well regarded across the internet, consistently in Top 10 Afternoon Tea lists and excellent value to boot.I book via their website a few days before we wanted to go. I was worried I'd left it to late but it's was incredibly simple. In the time between booking, confirming and getting there are numbers had dwindled but the staff were absolutely fine with it.I really should get onto the afternoon tea though. I should have told you already, but this was my first ever afternoon tea (in 28 years, how is that possible?). I ordered a pot of Vanilla Black and shortly after our cake stand arrived, overflowing with beautifully presented sandwiches, cakes and sweet treats. I was shocked by just how much the three of us would be eating: 3 mini sandwiches, a scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam, 3 types of brownies, muffins, meringues and marshmallows. EACH!Bea's really is not only excellent value for money but excellent full stop. I will go again (and again and again)",

It's enough to bring the whole experience down.Considering the place was only about half full (and the upstairs area only about 10 tables to begin with), tea service was achingly slow. Nevermind how long it SHOULD take to bring out a pre-assembled tray of nibbles (random thought: it would have also been nice to specify the flavor of Bea's creative cupcakes rather than being given two at random, no rhyme or reason per table)... I assume the intention was to stagger the treats a bit after we've had time to savor and sip the tea. But how long does water take to boil? The tea itself didn't come until over 30 minutes after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the waiter wasn't doing much only 10 steps away, he never came over to let us know what was going on. Perhaps he had no concept of time?",

Nothing is better than scones with clotted cream and jam. We split a lot of tea since we were short on time but it was plenty. Also try the Guiness cake, delicious!",

    "text": "Before coming to London, afternoon tea was probably the thing I was most excited about (that's normal, right?). So a couple friends and I went on Yelp one night, looked up afternoon tea places, and came across this one that seemed pretty highly rated. The pictures and website looked promising enough, so we made a reservation online and visited the next day.The afternoon tea menu is pretty simple - I believe you're given three options that only differ by the inclusion of \"extra\" drinks. I went with the basic option and ordered green tea. The food (on the stereotypically cute tower) came out relatively quickly, and at first glance I thought \"ok, this is a reasonable amount of food.\" But then 5 minutes later ANOTHER plate came out - this time with our sandwiches. And holy, these sandwiches are NOT your traditional \"high tea\" sandwiches with thin white bread. These were EXTREMELY bread-heavy sandwiches (that were not cute at all...besides the point, but still worth mentioning).I decided to try a sandwich first - big mistake. The bread was super salty and since it was so thick I also started feeling pretty full. But then we still had the tower of sweets. I tried the marshmallow next - pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the meringue, and I definitely wasn't a fan of the brownies, which I thought were too hard and one of which tasted like Snickers...I didn't really like the cupcakes either - the texture of the frosting was a bit off and the cake part didn't taste that great either.The redeeming points of this place, in my opinion, are the scones and the service. The scones were by far my favorite, especially paired with the jam (didn't really fancy the clotted cream). Oh, and the tea was pretty good too. I also really appreciated the service - the staff was so kind and definitely made our experience much better than it would have just based on the food.Will I be back? Probably not. For 27 pounds per person, I'd like to get more than just good scones and service. (The place/setting/decor IS pretty cute though, I'll admit.)",

    "text": "They have several different locations but I went to the caf\u00e9 in Marylebone (Devonshire Street); for some reason I couldn't find it listed, so I'll leave my review here instead.We were greeted at first by a lovely and smiling waitress who took our order and asked us to find any table available. The empty ones at the front were bigger, seating four people, so I walked to the back in order to find a table for two as I didn't want to occupy a table meant for a larger group. Another young lady (maybe the manager as she wasn't wearing an apron) came to us (a bit too frantically and we noticed it) and told me we couldn't seat there as the table was already booked, then suddenly looked surprised and asked \"oh, is it for you?\". Well, if she didn't know WHO had booked the table then it would be less rude to ask first or just lead us to an available one. There was no \"reserved\" card on that table either, so there was no way I should know. Was there anything on me that made me look like I couldn't possibly have booked that table? Just odd. There were lots of cupcakes but only 3 flavours of cakes (two of them chocolate). The tea was lovely, my friend doesn't like chocolate so she ordered a huge meringue and it was also tasty. But the blondie I had, the main reason for my visit, was a disappointment. I expect a blondie to be moist, soft and a bit gooey in the middle, but this one was totally dry and quite hard. It wasn't that late in the day to justify it being stale. I ate it as I didn't want to kick up a fuss after that not so warm welcome, but I wasn't impressed at all. For the price and the small size I expected a really nice slice of cake but got a tiny brick instead. The same strange lady kept removing the plates from our table as soon as the food had finished. To me it's only polite to wait a minute or so before approaching the table with a smile and ask if we had finished, if we wanted something else, etc. The plates were just swept away without a word or smile. In my case I was still chewing the last forkful (ok, admittedly with that though blondie I had to chew for a while). I felt my presence was somehow unwanted and felt rushed to leave, what I did promptly with no intention to return. My blondie sucked, I didn't try the cupcakes and maybe the rest of the food is good, but they need to work on that attitude.",

I almost got a little nervous when I saw some of the reviews, but Bea's held up to all the hype. Other Yelp-ers complained about the service being slow. I visited this shop on a busy Saturday afternoon and my service was great. Friendly, young, smiling faces sat me at my table, took my order, and checked up on me several times. If they were slow in serving me I didn't notice because I was so relaxed in their quaint little shop. I saw other Yelp-ers give less stars because of their food. I was honestly very impressed with everything I was served. Moist blondies and brownies. Delicious homemade marshmallows and meringues. The cupcake was so moist, but I didn't care for the frosting (I'm not much of a frosting person anyways, so take that with a grain of salt). And let me talk about their scones for a second. The best scone I've ever had and the clotted cream and preserves made that thing practically sinful. I also got three savoury finger sandwiches, which were very tasty as well. And my pot of english breakfast was perfection.Overall great spot for tea. For all that you get (5 treats, a cupcake, a scone, 3 sandwiches, and a pot of tea), \u00a319 is a good price. I'll be back for sure.",

I guess we had a pleasant experience with the food as well. But that is none of your business. Hot chocolate was oh so delicious and just cute. I very much enjoyed it and wish that I could drink significantly more milk in one sitting without throwing up. Well, there's that for you... get it.Tomato soup was very good and paired well with my Croissant with avocado on it. It isn't something to eat by itself it needs sustenance with it (some type of bread) in order to fill you up but the flavor is delightful.THE VERDICT:Everything I had I enjoyed and I believe that there are numerous locations so you should be able to find one or maybe even look for a more proper tea. Expect to drop some dough though, this place isn't inexpensive but it is totally worth the tea experience that I think everyone visiting London should enjoy once... let me repeat, once. Somewhere between a 3.5 and 4.",

The GF really wanted to try afternoon tea in the UK and while there are definitely tons of options, Bea's is one of the cheaper \"multi-level\" afternoon tea places. For about $USD, we got to choose a tea, and tons of snacks. The tea is so-so. Packaging looked like it came from a store. Bea's is one of the more affordable places. I loved their savory snacks such as the sandwiches the best, but the bread and jams were not as good. Scones were a little too dry for my taste. This is ALOT of food. We saved the sweets for last and didn't even get to eat the whole thing since I was completely full!One gripe: After a while, they had to take away our multilevel snack shelf dish so they could prep afternoon tea for another party. Overall 4 stars. This kept the GF occupied for a couple hours.",

The tea itself was standard. I got earl grey while the bf got some sort of fruity one. The real standout for me were the scones. They were delicious!!! I also enjoyed the sandwiches. They were a little different since they were on mini brioche buns but quite delicious nonetheless. By the time we got to the sweets we were both pretty stuffed. I didn't get to eat too much of the cupcakes but I was shocked to be so full. It was a great experience and the inside was so nice.",

I very easily made a reservation for 4 30 minutes before the time I wanted and when we arrived, the table was set up for us. Our server was kind and explained to us how Afternoon Tea works. One tower is for 2 people and 1 person is \u00a325. We ordered 2 towers for 4 people and had plenty of food leftover. A tower comes with a savory level, a scone level, and a dessert level. I personally did not care for the savory level. The sandwiches were either too bland or they just were nothing special. The scones were delicious since they were homemade. A lot of the desserts were also not spectacular but just ok.The teas on the other hand were great. I loved the berry tea and had 2 pots of that while sitting there.Overall, I enjoyed the experience I had here, but would not come back as the food was nothing memorable. It's a great one time thing to do if you're in the area!",

However, I found the flavours to really fall flat. \u00a0I was looking forward to a more dynamic taste and again I found the cupcakes to be dry. \u00a0I do have high expectations, but I didn't even finish the cupcakes. I'm always a little annoyed when I spend money on something I could have made better at home.I wouldn't return and would recommend trying someplace else.",

    "text": "After doing some research on a traveler budget-friendly afternoon tea experience, I ended up at Bea's of Bloomsbury on a solo trip to London earlier this year. The online booking process through their website was relatively quick, and I was easily able to make a reservation for the next afternoon.When I arrived, I was greeted by two friendly employees who jokingly commented on my reservation for 1 (\"We don't often see people come in to eat on their own, but we think that it's great!\") while simultaneously making me feel right at home. My table had already been set up prior, and they wasted no time in bringing my tower of savory and sweet treats (I opted for the \u00a324.50 Full Afternoon tea) as well as taking my tea order (I chose a classic English Breakfast). The desserts were delicious - especially the red velvet cupcake - and I particularly enjoyed the parma ham, mascarpone cream, honey and fig relish brioche, which provided a perfectly balanced combination of sweet and salty in each bite. However, my overwhelming favorite was the scone, which had just the right amount of crumble paired with a soft, buttery inside. I am (not so secretly) in love with clotted cream, and the trifecta of carbs + cream + raspberry preserves was just so satisfying. Unfortunately, my stomach wasn't quite large enough to finish everything in one sitting, but the staff was kind enough to box up my leftover desserts (+ some extra clotted cream on my request), which I happily finished for breakfast the next morning. The next time that I find myself in London, I would absolutely make a return visit to Bea's to try some of their other desserts (and snag a couple more of those scones!).",

    "text": "Another reviewer wrote that \"there are some kinks\" and I couldn't agree more. I had booked 24 hours prior to our visit, and yet, all that got us was the cramped table by the doorway. Aw!The regular afternoon tea includes 2 marshmallows, meringues, cupcakes, brownies, scones (with jam and clotted cream), and sets of sandwiches..Also each one of you is given a teapot, a small teapot, quite small...I thought the sandwiches were delicious, and very buttery (I think we had parma ham, cold cuts, and chicken). My main gripe was the clotted cream. I like it very clotted, and this had the consistency of margarine. The cupcakes were alright, but then I'm not a cupcake die-hard. Should I recommend one, I'd say go for the dark chocolate and raspberry one, the nutella one is forgettable. The raspberry marshmallow is delicious though! We couldn't finish all our tea tray, and the waitress gave us the remainder in a paper bag. No boxes? Eh, the service is a bit chilly, British experience I guess?Oh and the price for afternoon tea is per person, which I didn't get somehow, so that'll set you back 50 quid for two. A dramatic increase from the past year it seems.",

The icing was a thick layer of truffle-like icing, which went well with the sponge. So v. expensive but a high quality product.

I remember several small round tables with some comfy, fancy looking chairs that seemed perfect for reading the paper whilst downing a cup of joe.

The staff indirectly tried to tell us to leave, that there would be a looong waiting process, but we got a table in 5 mins! At 5.30pm (They close at 6pm) they started clearing up and cleaning the place and seemed very bothered that people still wanted to be served. At 5.50pm we were told that they close in 10 minutes....If staff are unhappy and rude it's obviously a place which lacks 'soul'.

    "text": "I stumbled upon this by accident yesterday whilst walking along Theobald Road. The little placard with 'afternoon tea' written on it was all the invite I needed and a quick peek into the establishment itself gave off the most amazing views of bountiful looking cakes and other delicious looking sweet treats. The place itself was fairly quiet on a Friday afternoon but still buzzy as there just happened to be a film crew and a photographer in situ (random but nice). There is seating for about 20 or so I would say indoors and outside seating consisting of 2 round garden tables + chairs. I went for the Afternoon tea as I am a cream tea freak and have been known to engineer a trip to Cornwall just for this! I loved the presentation of my tea, the jam came in its own little quaint glass jar with a spoon (more than enough for the 2 scones it comes with) and there was the most amazingly luscious tasting clotted cream on the side served nicely chilled. The scones were so light and quite sweet and not at all stody or rock-cake looking (gosh, does that make any sense!). As mentioned I LOVE cream tea and I am not known to ever leave any but I was so full up on the beauty of it all that I left half a scone in the end - very very filling for something so lightly baked. As a non caffeine drinker, it was nice to have a choice of herbal and fruit tea on offer, though a customer did mention that the coffee was lush. My word not his! A birthday cake made to order was picked up whilst I was there and it looked dreamy and I think a future cake order is imminent. On a girly note, I adored the wallpaper that backed the serving area; tres chic and yes, very Parisian Oui! The whole place is cute and twee and definitely worth visiting so make sure you do. It would also be great for a birthday party/lunch for a treasured daughter/little sister/god-daughter methinks. Or at least I think so! The nearest tube station is Chancery Lane but Farringdon is not that much further.",

The perfect solution for an impromptu picnic (londonist.com/2009/03/be\u2026) . Last tasty treat I picked up at Bea's was a cup of crab chowder. I appreciate their ever changing menu - I just hope Bea will keep that one around and on heavy rotation. Yum. For dessert, you can't beat their cupcakes (londonist.com/2008/02/qu\u2026) .",

In fact, Bea's has the sort of neo-Victorian style that will appeal more to grown-ups. And why not? A good alternative to a pub or a chain coffee house, Bea's is a great place for coffee and conversation. And cake, of course.In addition to trendy cupcakes, they have more averagely sized cakes, mini Victoria sponges and flavoured meringues the size of your fist. If you're not interested in coffee (though it is good coffee - no instant here), they have a selection of posh fizzy drinks. The staff are lovely, too. I saw a booth of theirs at a food fair and asked about an item I didn't remember from the shop. They cheerfully informed me that I called a day or two in advance they would do their best to have it when I came 'round. It's an offer worth taking them up on.",

It's hard to resist the towers of cakes and muffins that greet you as you walk in which this place is famous for, but instead I opted for the porridge, with lots of lovely brown sugar and dried fruit on top. Normally porridge that isn't your own can taste like lumpy diluted cardboard soup (if there is such a thing!?) but this one was creamy, sweet and very tasty. They brew the lovely monmouth coffee here too, which on a Friday morning always hits the spot. The cheesecake looked incredible and I'll definitely have to come back to try something naughty and sweet, but maybe to take away. I just have one gripe with this place - you can see right into the kitchen which usually is a really good thing, especially in a sushi restaurant or a bustling kitchen, but here the bakery is really clinical and all I could see when sipping my coffee was the first aid box and hand towels on the wall also they started cooking the lunch menu and my eyes are still stinging and running from the onions throughout our breakfast! Sorry Bea's, that lost you a 5th star - yummy food and coffee, but maybe use less onion next time??",

Though the interior is fairly small and best for small groups, it's nicely decorated and pleasantly organized, making it feel like as much a real, functioning cafe as it is a cutesy \"tea room\". The afternoon tea service features a pot of tea and a 2-tiered collection of scones and desserts. Judging by the other photos, it looks like you get a different cupcake every time, depending on the day/season. The other sweet things were small brownies, blondies, meringues and fancy marshmallows, plus the obligatory scones (very fresh!) with jam and clotted cream. Aside from the tea service, Bea's also offers salads, sandwiches, and a mouthwatering collection of cakes, cupcakes and other desserts. It took everything in me to resist buying more cupcakes after I'd finished the tea. The best part is that this fabulous afternoon tea experience was only \u00a310 per person (as of Oct. 2010. It's gone up to \u00a312 now but that's still a fantastic deal). This was the reasonably-priced, adorable-sans-pretentiousness afternoon tea that my mother and I hoped for years ago on our last vacation -- now we know exactly where to go!",

The cafe wasn't lively at the museum but was extremely refined and the quick tour I gave myself was great - what a pleasure to be in the same place as one of the world's literary greats! I'm guessing from the previous reviews the permanent premises is quite the place to be seen, so I think I'll have to go there to find out for myself.",

    "text": "Unassuming little cafe frontage on busy Theobald's Road, opens up into a beautifully chic little cafe. It was worth the 10 minute walk through the park from King's Cross. It doesn't have the nicest of views, though as we sat outside on the first sunny day of the month I couldn't help but be grateful it wasn't on nearby pedestrianised Lamb's Conduit Street. Cupcakes of this quality would ensure a permanently packed front stoop.A light passionfruit and vanilla cupcake came with a fresh drizzle of fresh fruit across the top and was light and creamy with the two flavours matching well. A raspberry and chocolate cake was a real hit. Luscious, smooth and velvety, the dark, almost liquid centred chocolate sponge accompanied the raspberry buttercream perfectly. Our final cake was a chocolate piece studded with blueberries. Sadly the blueberry either wasn't present, or didn't come through in the flavour of the cake, but it was still a treat. Definitely worth fighting through the fashionistas on a sunny afternoon for artisan cakes and wonderfully friendly service. They also do mail order, events and party catering too. A lovely local gem that deserves some support.",

I strongly recommend the afternoon tea on weekends, which my friends and I indulged in one fine Sunday in August after a hen night out. For \u00a312 per person, we got practically unlimited servings of cupcakes and finger sandwiches, along with a pot of Jing tea. It was wonderful, and just a perfect way to recover from a late night out. We also had Bea's custom design two cupcakes with photos of her and her soon-to-be husband printed out as edible photos and placed on the cupcakes. They turned out very well and were amazingly affordable and, well, the look of pleasant surprise on my friend's face said it all really. If, on the other hand, you're not set on eating your body weight in cakes when you're here, then try the chai latte. I'm usually a coffee drinker, but the chai is seriously good.",

    "text": "Full review at thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  Since when did cupcakes and afternoon tea become so trendy? My earliest experience of afternoon tea was at the Edinburgh zoo tea room and Bettys in Harrogate \u00a0all scones, doilies and blue rinses; and not a single skinny jean in sight. However, like the denim shirt, what was once considered naff can become high fashion, and in London cupcakes and tea are like soooo hot right now. I recently loved afternoon tea at the Wolseley, and at the Bath Spa; and I'd love to try it at the Ritz, the Dorchester and Fortnum & Mason. But a little less Miss Marple, and easier on the wallet, is Bea's of Bloomsbury, half way between Holborn and Chancery Lane. I have to say I have a savoury rather than a sweet tooth. Like Joey from Friends, the sandwich is probably my favourite food group, and I'd take a cheese board over pudding any day. That's not to say I don't like chocolate \u00a0far from it, especially at 4pm during my working week \u00a0but I don't tend to crave sweet things. However, walking into Bea's, you can't fail to notice how pretty everything looks. Pink swirly cupcakes, huge plates of giant macaroons and meringues, sweets, biscuits. Sugar heaven but not at all twee \u00a0there's no pink china or doilies (shame actually!). We sat down and ordered cute little pots of tea and tiered treats. Starting from the bottom, the trays were filled with delicious scones (served with clotted cream and jam), marshmallows, tiny brownies and shortbread, then up to wildly adorned cupcakes (LOVED the be-glittered ones!) and macaroons. The scones were lovely \u00a0perfect with jam and tea \u00a0and the cupcakes were amazingly soft and moist and incredibly sickly sweet and covered in gloops of sugary icing but still yum yum yum. As I said, my fantasty-island tier would include little cucumber and cheese sandwiches, but this was bloody good. Not used to sweet things, and seemingly born with an inability to stop eating when full, I managed to leave feeling a little sick from the sugar rush, which left me slumped in my chair with only the promise of impending white wine to wake me up. I think I've read somewhere about poor service and I have to say the staff weren't the friendliest I've ever met, but nothing outrageous, and sadly in London trendy venues can be the victims of their own popularity and forget to treat customers like kings and queens (as they always do at somewhere like the Wolseley). Although the food is a treat so the service should be the same really. It wouldn't put me off going back though \u00a0it is the PERFECT place to take your sweet-toothed friends, or your mum, or visitors to London who haven't realised that tea and cupcakes are trendy again, an alternative date venue, and a gluttonous alternative to wine-filled sessions with girlfriends.",

Everything looked lovely, however after our first bite, we both realised that most of the cakes and treats were quite dried out. There was a possibility that everything had been laid out earlier and perhaps exposed, hence the lack of moisture.I really don't like giving bad reviews! I did contact the manager, who apologised and said she would look into it. We were offered a box of six cupcakes by way of a gesture, but we don't want them! We much prefer Betty Blythes!",

They were everything a cupcake should be, and left all these other so-called cupcakes dead in the water.

    "text": "Just not impressed. I got unfeasibly excited about going to Bea's last week and was very disappointed by the experience. I phoned a couple of days in advance to order a batch of gluten free cupcakes as a birthday treat for a friend but when I arrived on the collection day there was no record of my order. As the salesgirl scrabbled around trying to find out what had happened I admit to being somewhat awestruck by the fantastical cakey creations that surrounded me - the place is worth a visit just to look - but the increasing worry that my bike ride across London had been in vain and I would have to turn up empty handed to meet my pal prevented me from full enjoyment. When it turned out the order had definitely disappeared, not been processed or whatever I was told I was in luck, because they happened to have plenty of the gluten free cupcakes in that day anyway. Oh, lucky me! In the end my friend was very pleased with her birthday treat so I was happy on that score, though disappointed not to particularly enjoy MY cakes! They were quite dry, bland and had far too much excessively creamy topping, possibly added to mask the lack of flavour everywhere else. They weren't cheap either - I paid \u00a315 for 6 cupcakes and some bite-size bits of raspberry meringue (these were gorgeous) - and I have to say I'd be happier getting lovely moist 2 for \u00a31 muffins from Sainsburys next time I need a cake fix.

    "text": "Ooooh this place is going to become a firm favourite. Why haven't I been there before? Well, because it's kinda in London nomansland. That bit inbetween Central and Clerkenwell is a little bit weird isn't it? Unless you actually have a reason to go the area, it's not the kind of place you'd stumble across. But it's worth the trip on its own. I was there for a meeting yesterday and we ended up staying for three hours. THAT is the power of a decent cafe. The staff are friendly and happy to help, the cakes are STUNNING (individual lemon meringue tart anyone?) and it's the perfect place to just sit and while away an hour or so. Their choice to stock Luscombe organic drinks just adds to my happiness - I'm powerless before sparkling clementine juice. I was tempted by the afternoon tea - at \u00a38 for a cupcake, scone and three mini desserts as well as a pot of tea it's a bargain. But, I'm just going to have to pop back and try that. Maybe Bea's cute little shitzu puppies will be there again. I liked them. Even though the latte I had wasn't anything to shout about, there's nothing I dislike about this place. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for - wonderful, stunning cakes that have been made with thought and care. There's even a few seats outside if the weather holds out. I can see it becoming a firm favourite.",

    "text": "I moved to the area a few weeks ago and I was dying to try Bea's. Today, I did. Oh, dear. What a disappointment. We went at 3pm, wanting to avoid a queue. There was a queue, albeit small. Here are my opinions: 1) The layout is awful. Just a narrow strip of cramped tables. At the rear is the kitchen, on display, but in all honesty, it should be hidden. It's just your average messy commercial kitchen. Nothing to show off about! 2) The staff today (31/3/10) were charmless and slack. There seemed to be lots of them but none of them in the least bit interested in doing their job. We had to ask, repeatedly, for anything we wanted. No attention paid at all. I so wish I hadn't wimped out and left a tip! 3) Finally: the cakes. Hmm. Obviously I can't speak for the whole menu, but the (very large) slice of gateau I had was rubbish, really. Far too much sugar and buttercream and far too little cake. Far too little skill, in fact. My companion had a cupcake which also looked fab but, again, was all mouth and no trousers. No better than the stuff they sell in, say, Gregg's. I'd expected proper patisserie. When I think about the snotty comments some peeps make about Patisserie Paul or Patisserie Valerie I want to laugh. They may be chains, but their produce is very acceptable. I'm really sorry to have written this, because, as I said, I just moved to the area and I'd hoped Bea's would be a \"find\". It absolutely was not. It was expensive, over-rated and complacent. I shan't be returning. YMMV, as they say.",

    "text": "I found out about Bea's via \"I Know A Great Little Place\" and decided that it would be ideal for my best friend's hen party. \u00a0An email to the general info address led to a quick, friendly, helpful response, informing me that whilst they wouldn't be able to accommodate the entire group during their regular opening hours, it would be possible to hire out the place for a mere \u00a320 per head for unlimited cakes and sandwiches, plus \u00a32.50 per head corkage if we wished to bring our own booze.Good deal, I thought. \u00a0But not wishing to risk untested waters on an event of such importance, I roped in my little sister for an advance recce. \u00a0We pitched up one Saturday afternoon to try it out on the sly, sampling the afternoon tea menu as regular punters, with fantastic results. \u00a0The tea selection had flavours I had never seen before, yet was not so extensive that I was left incapable of making a choice. \u00a0The sweet treats were loving presented on a cake stand and we found ourselves full almost to bursting less than half-way through. \u00a0Still, so delicious were they that we soldiered on regardless, munching our way through cupcakes, marshmallows, scones, meringues, brownies and blondies - all home-made, all delicious, and all wonderfully, refreshingly, not overly-sweet. \u00a0Despite arriving practically at the end of the afternoon, the staff were all friendly and attentive and we never felt rushed at all.I immediately went home and confirmed the hen night booking. \u00a0There then began a succession of emails: panicked on my side, calm and helpful on Bea's. \u00a0They did everything they could to help me plan and even agreed with no complaints whatsoever to refund me when one of our party dropped out the day before.The event itself was so successful that I can barely believe it even now. \u00a0I arrived at 6pm and they were gently ushering out the remaining customers, so that I could get on with decorating - not that I needed to do much since the place is already so elegant and welcoming. \u00a0By the time the group arrived at 6:30, the counter was already groaning under the weight of both sweet and savoury delights; all of the cakes we had tried during afternoon tea plus some delicious tiny baguettes which genuinely were endless. \u00a0As soon as a platter appeared to be running dry, another would miraculously appear in its place. \u00a0And throughout proceedings, the staff were cheery, delightful and even joined in, helping with music for the games. \u00a0They didn't even bat an eyelid at our Butler In The Buff . . .To top it all off, as we got ready to leave we discovered that they had generously packed up all of the remaining food into individual party bags for us; a welcome treat for the miserable post-club journey home some six hours later.I literally cannot recommend this place highly enough, and will do so to anyone and everyone I meet. \u00a0It's astonishingly good value for money, even for a cash-strapped underling like myself, and I can't wait to return.",

The one complaint i have is that the tea came long before the scones, which took awhile to make, but the scones were delicious!. They made them and baked them fresh, so when we received them they were hot out of the oven. They also came with butter and delicious jelly.
