    "text": "St John was on our list for quite some time, especially since we live 5 minutes away. I have to clarify that both me and my wife have grown up in places where eating offals is not only acceptable but rather a habit.So, to the point. The good ones:The bone marrow. It was fantastic. Really deserves its status as the signature dish. And shows how stupid people have been to ignore that part of the animal for years and years. The Jerusalem artichoke appetizer. It was really good. It could definitely make a disoriented vegetarian enjoy his time in St John.The bread. It was sourdough and a bit heavy on the sour, but that's how I like it.The (very) bad ones:The middlewhite. A thick slice of tasteless, dry pork. No sauce, just a few excellent parsnips on the side. Will get back to this in a bit.The sweetbreads. I love them since I was a child. And although this dish was OK, it must have been the least interesting dish involving sweetbreads I've ever had.The service. It took them \u00a01hr after they took away the appetizers to bring the mains. And this place has a Michelin star. Do the Michelin folks read yelp?The service (part 2). The waiter asked at the end of the meal how was everything. And we honestly said our opinion, especially about the pork. What we didn't expect at that time is that we would have to explain to a number of people why we didn't like it, listen to how sorry they were and how they were willing to bring us champagne, desert, more wine, bla bla bla. They ended up not including the pork dish in the bill (which we didn't ask for of course) while at the same time explaining that the dish came out of the kitchen as intended. Which makes us the problematic customers I guess. Whatever.",

The wheat beer is fantastic - \u00a0which is really difficult to say in London. I have also heard that their cider is the best. The entire place smells like fresh bread - because they are also a bakery (!!!!) - and the bar menu is really extensive, creative and inexpensive! If you want to go into the dining area, I recommend a reservation. Also, you must order the bone marrow salad. It is so delicious and perfectly prepared. Otherwise, the menu changes quite regularly. I had one of the specials - pintail duck - which was nice, but not the best duck I've ever had. Though this is normally what I judge a restaurant on, the atmosphere, wine, bone marrow salad, and AMAZING brown bread ice cream and sticky toffee pudding were all too fantastic. The mains can be a bit small so go with friends and order lots of different plates and definitely indulge in the dessert.",

    "text": "I have not had a worse dining experience in a so called 4 star restaurant in my entire life! Our waitress made a point of treating us as badly as possible. I ordered the asparagus appetizer and after receiving it in a matter of about 2 minutes (They are very interested in turning over tables) it was cold and barley cooked, in other words it was inedible. I was going to just set it aside but my wife insisted on asking the waitress about it and she told us that it was supposed to be that way. I couldn't believe it. If the otter leaves were that undercooked just imagine what the heart would have been like? Rubber.So in a huff our waitress brought it back to the kitchen and brought me a bowl of uncooked pea pods. I'm not kidding. They weren't even washed. Since she was being so mean I set it aside and waited for our main course. I had the suckling pig and my wife had sweetbreads. Both were tasteless. By this time our waitress was slamming things on the table and being incredibly mean. And for no reason. We were being nice to her most of the dinner. Until waiting 25 minutes for the check. Then, and only then did I speak up. This is the sort of place where you eat dirt and thank them for it. It's a posh hipster wanna be taco stand where the likes of Anthony Bourdain drop by for 4 star dinners that I'm sure are just fine when the cameras rolling. I did two things I've never done in my life. I sent back food and yes, I stiffed the waitress. She was just awful. Purposely mean without provocation.St John's has taken culinary simplicity to new heights. Next thing you know they'll be serving air. Don't waste your time. Pub food beats this place 100 to 1!!!",

Good service, nice ambiance, the venue definitely looks interesting, it's not flashy, just very toned back yet sophisticated, and busy. Everyone here was there to eat. Menu updated every day, fantastic meat, unique dishes, it's the kind of place that will give you cravings. Prices are worth it. If anyone ever mocks British cuisine, bring them here.I had the bone-marrow starter... nice combination with the bread... Then I had the ox-heart, amazingly well prepared, just good solid meat, no complaints at all, very satisfying.",

It was so nice to go to a restaurant and celebrate English cooking, it's just a shame many other restaurants serve overpriced rubbish. The restaurant was full and had a great atmosphere and there were a couple of tables who were having the feasting menu, complete with Suckling Pig. We chose a wine that was delightful (the list is entirely French) with main courses of Ox Heart, Gloucester Old Spot, and Mackerel. Beautiful fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection - what more could one ask for? \u00a0Oh, and a pudding of Blackcurrant Eton Mess for pudding was excellent too.And for one of London's best restaurants, I think it offers good value.",

However, the food was still pretty solid. \u00a0There are two St. John Restaurants, and we mistakenly made a reservation at the other location. The manager was very nice and called up the other location when he couldn't find our reservation. Instead of sending us to the other location, he quickly said that he could accommodate our reservation at the current location. I did get to try the bone marrow with parsley salad, and it was fun to eat. I didn't think the bone marrow added too much flavor overall, but it was still fun. My main course was the roast pork, which was not as good as the appetizer. I had their fresh baked madelines for dessert and they were delicious.",

And you can get something like 30 wines by the glass, all at decent prices. Sure, it's a bit on the spendy side. But you pay for quality of ingredients, service, and technique. Where the hell else are you going to get Michelin-starred food without pomp or circumstance at under \u00a340 a head?If you are in London, and you like food, you should eat here at least once (the experience will bring you back)",

    "text": "I wish I could submit this without a rating because I feel like I'm not doing this place justice to serious diners by giving it a 3-star rating. \u00a0I feel like the Soviet judge when somebody from a 'happy country' would perform perfectly on the balance beam only to see Olga Krykxizcsighsikciaicvszyxyxza from Moscow throw out a 6.5.Quick caveat: \u00a0I'm American and visited St John on Anthony Bourdain's recommendation.Prior to arrival, I glimpsed an example of a standard St. John menu online and could have sworn I saw chicken and/or beef on there. \u00a0When we arrived at the restaurant, alas, it looked more like a menu from Fear Factor.I don't find eating small game very appealing. \u00a0I have no interest in eating ducks, bunnies, or any other cute little animals. \u00a0I prefer eating chunks from big animals nobody likes (cows). \u00a0With that said, my menu options were limited but, by damned, I wasn't leaving there without sampling this Roast Bone Marrow that Mr. Bourdain said was the greatest thing he'd ever eaten. \u00a0My date was shocked I wouldn't eat a duck but I would eat bone marrow. \u00a0Honestly, I didn't envision it looking the way it did. \u00a0I wasn't sure what to expect but, as best as I can describe, it looked like liquidy, yet clumpy, um . . . sperm. \u00a0Now I was second-guessing my dining choice. \u00a0I decided to bite the bullet and eat the spe . . . uh, bone marrow. \u00a0I dug it out of the bone, spread it on the toast, sprinkled some salt on it and . . . it wasn't bad. \u00a0There are a thousand-and-one things, Mr. Bourdain, I would rather eat than this, but it wasn't bad. \u00a0I proceeded to polish off an entire piece of toast and dug bone marrow out of a couple of the hacked-off legs before me and, forgoing all of the entr\u00e9e options, I was ready for dessert. \u00a0The dessert: \u00a0we decided to split a couple of desserts. \u00a0We ordered a chocolate cake that didn't taste much better than something we could've microwaved back in the states and a pastry called Madeleines that, well . . . not much going for those either. \u00a0No filling, frosting, fruit . . . just . . . I don't know . . . like a tart without filling? \u00a0If you were to ask me for my honest appraisal of St. John, I would give it 1-star. \u00a0I would have no desire to return because 'snout to tail' eating just sounds repulsive to me. \u00a0However, if they threw some steak (or even chicken) on the menu, I MIGHT consider returning.",

I sat in the courtyard area, which is beautiful on a sunny day, to enjoy a glass of wine and felt instantly relaxed. No pressure from the staff to move into the dining room, even though we'd passed our booking time. I expect this would be different at dinner. Classic decor, excellent service and the Great British menu. Bone marrow toast, welsh rarebit, saddle of rabbit. spring asparagus and a bottle and a half of white - \u00a390 including tip. Not cheap but not ridiculous.Love this place.",

When we first arrived we were the only group there however within 10mins or so the whole room quickly filled up. This place is simple. Not fussy in decor, you almost feel like your at a hospital. Service is interesting, not over the top in your face but not mean. They wait until you flag them over but get you everything you ask for. \u00a0The standout dish for me was the Bone Marrow. I could of order an extra plate, it's extremely rich in flavor and we also ordered \"stinking bishop\" which was a pot of melted cheese. AMAZING. I hope to return here someday!",

    "text": "Now I know that this is one of London's most famous and well respected restaurants but I had one of the most underwhelming and frankly disappointing meals I've ever eaten in this city. My boyfriend and I made a reservation several weeks in advance for a Saturday evening spot. The decor in the place is sparse white walls, a full view into the kitchen, and tables right up against one another so you can basically hear everything your neighbours are saying (and they can hear you) but if the food was as good as rumoured I was more than willing to forgive decoration. We had one glass of wine each and ordered the rabbit offal to share as an appetiser, two of the braised longhorn with mashed potatoes & a side of greens for our main and the Paris Brest as a desert. Our waiter completely forgot about the offal and within 15 minutes our longhorn was brought to the table, so unfortunately I can't review the starter. But as for the longhorn it was nothing special. It's not that there was anything wrong with it - it was tasty enough and the mash was fine - but my mother's brown stew tastes exactly the same (and my mother, while being a great cook, is not a world class chef who charges 26.5\u00a3 for each plate of her cooking.) The only saving grace to the whole meal were the greens which were perfectly cooked. Then we had desert, during which our waiter again forgot that I had also asked for a cup of tea and needed to be reminded. The Brest was fine but again nothing out of this world - I've had far nicer deserts at Roast or any of the Hawksmoor locations. Now perhaps we simply chose badly in our courses but the fact of the matter is this - when we pay almost 90\u00a3 for a meal (starter not included) at a restaurant that has close to a 5 star rating from every review written it made us feel pretty let down. I know the menu changes frequently so hopefully they'll reorganise to show their strengths but we won't be going back to find out. My advice is if you're looking for a great restaurant in London to eat some really good meat, try Roast in Borough Market, Hawksmoor Spitalfields or Seven Dials, Rules in Covent Garden or Tramshed. The only pros here is that the service was prompt enough and the greens are pretty good.",

    "text": "I've been intrigued by Fergus Henderson ever since I came across his book \"Nose To Tail Eating: A Kind of English Cooking\" while contemplating how to deal with the fact that I'd just bought a whole hog, including the \"not so popular\" bits such as the head, feet and tail. I was so pleased that there was a book out there that told me exactly what to do with, for example, pigs ears (using his recipe, they were quite tasty, if a bit chewy...but no matter how you slice it, a pig's ear is a pig's ear).So on a recent trip to London this spring, St John was the only restaurant reservation I made and the only place I really felt I *had* to go. Yup, I had the celebrated Bone Marrow and it was fabulous. Perfectly roasted, paired perfectly with crisp toast and the tangy parsley salad that complements the richness of the marrow. I kick myself now that I didn't write down what else we ate, but all of it was delicious. For the main course I had some kind of pork magic...succulent and just beautiful in its porkiness. Dining companion had....some kind of fish that was cloaked in a sauce that blew my mind. Daughter had....can't remember, but she ate all of it, which really says something. Imagine my 13 year old's surprise when the waitress poured her a glass of wine along with myself and our dining companion. Apparently this is how they do it in London. Of course, being a responsible parent (and not wanting to waste an expensive glass of wine on someone who was really looking for a Coke), I gently slid her glass over to my side of the table and proceeded to sit there with 2 glasses of wine in front of me. Classy.The service was quick and attentive, the setting was refreshingly un-fancy for such a famous restaurant.",

    "text": "Truly, I am so confused. \u00a0I was so excited to try this place on my visit to London, and I had chosen this place far ahead of our trip for my friends and me. \u00a0However, it just was not up to par to the standards I had expected. \u00a0How did this place earn a Michelin star?! \u00a0Not only was this the worst Michelin-rated restaurant I have ever dined in, but this was just a crappy experience all around. \u00a0Let me start by saying our experience was initially okay, but as dinner progressed, it just got worse and worse. \u00a0The food I ate was good, but the service in no way deserved a star.First off, there was not a butter knife for the bread and butter. \u00a0We used our own knives...not a big deal. \u00a0When our server came to clear our table when we finished the bread, she set our dirty knives (obviously dirty and leaning on the bread plate) back in their place. What happened to clean silverware each time?To add to service, they left the water pitcher on our table. \u00a0We were re-watering ourselves the entire dinner, as well as refilling our own glasses of wine. \u00a0Further, when we got up to use the restroom, our napkins were not folded when we arrived. \u00a0That was a first to me while dining in a Michelin restaurant.Bone marrow -- their signature dish: I will admit, it was delicious! \u00a0However, this is the first time I have had bone marrow where they do not cut the bones in half for easier scooping. \u00a0Instead, you hold the bone and use a little scalpel to hollow the bones out. \u00a0These bones are GREASY! \u00a0Oil everywhere, and definitely not enough napkins. \u00a0I wish they had cut the bones in half.Near the end, we were ready to order dessert and we could not find our server. \u00a0I think it took us 20-30 minutes after being done eating to finally order our desserts. \u00a0We were also ready for the check, and our server again was no where to be found. \u00a0It easily took another 20-30 minutes to close our tabs. \u00a0We were definitely waiting for about an hour total wondering where she was.Now to the ugly--20 minutes after my friend finished eating her food, she complained that she didn't feel well. \u00a0We raced home, and she threw up. \u00a0She threw up 10 times over the night, and had a very high fever. \u00a0She got food poisoning! \u00a0The only thing that she ate that the rest of us did not eat was the squid. \u00a0It was awful to see her like that, and it was the worst part of our vacation. \u00a0I don't know if this instance was a fluke or what. \u00a0I so badly wanted to love this place, but it was a huge letdown. \u00a0I am in no means high maintenance, but when you win an honor as highly coveted as a Michelin star, you must expect high standards. \u00a0We ate at Duck & Waffle two days later and this far exceeded our dinner at St John. \u00a0The service was 20 times better, and the food was great as well.",

    "text": "This was the final dinner of our recent European vacation. \u00a0An acquaintance, who shall not be named, had recommended that we have dinner here. \u00a0Supposedly there were no reservations available before 10:30pm on the night that we wanted to get in, so we contacted the concierge at the Landmark hotel, and he got us an earlier time of 9pm. \u00a0As is typical, I had done some research and noted that the reviews were quite mixed. \u00a0Net, it was more risk than I am usually willing to take with an unfamiliar restaurant. \u00a0We were at the end of a trip during which we had literally not had a single bad meal. \u00a0However, because the acquaintance who told us about it is in the restaurant business, I gave his recommendation considerable weight. \u00a0In hindsight, I'm guessing it's been several years since he's been to this restaurant, and maybe it was good - several years ago. \u00a0So, I knew we would refill our own water and wine, and didn't expect typical Michelin star service or any atmosphere even though it has one star. So, the service was okay. \u00a0The food, however... \u00a0I now totally understand the review I read that used the term \"from nose to tail - more like from bin to mouth\". \u00a0Within a few minutes of ordering, we received our first courses (we were not given bread beforehand - I had to ask for it, and since it was by far the most edible part of the meal, it was a good thing I did) - a salad with pig's head and brown crab on toast. \u00a0I expected crackling pork in the salad; instead it was long slabs of totally flavorless 99% fat. \u00a0How did they manage to make it lose all flavor along with all of the other salad ingredients? It was inedible. \u00a0The crab on toast tastes better than it looks (search online for photos to see what it looks like). \u00a0However, it looks pretty awful. \u00a0This was edible, but not particularly good. \u00a0They had sold out of the entree which we both wanted to order, so we followed the recommendation of our server and ordered roast beef. \u00a0The beef was a good cut, but there was nothing special about it. \u00a0I expect chefs to put flavors together well, and there was nothing going on. \u00a0At this point, my husband was commenting that the trip had gone so well, we were due for a bad meal. \u00a0It was clear he was going to get something to eat elsewhere once we left. \u00a0However, being a dessert fan, \u00a0I thought I could salvage dinner for myself by ordering the cherry-apple strudel. \u00a0When it arrived, I immediately fished out a cherry, popped it in my mouth and ... almost cracked a tooth. \u00a0They didn't bother to pit the cherries! \u00a0I can't imagine ever serving someone in my home a dessert where I didn't pit the cherries first - let alone at a Michelin starred restaurant. \u00a0Once I recovered, we ended up dissolving into giggles. \u00a0The waitstaff was probably wondering why we were sitting there laughing hysterically. \u00a0The meal was that bad. \u00a0I can't think of the last time I had a hyped meal that was so unbelievably bad. \u00a0The good news (in this case) - all of our courses came unbelievably quickly (almost everything is pre-prepared and served cold or at room temperature), so we were out of there within an hour. \u00a0It was a waste of a meal and money, but at least didn't waste a lot of time. \u00a0Michelin is leading people astray here. \u00a0BTW, when we arrived, there were numerous empty tables - it was clear that we could have come in much earlier. \u00a0I don't think our table was the only one that was moved along in no time.",

    "text": "What a fantastic place to have a meal. \u00a0The main dining area is no frills and open space. \u00a0I went late Friday evening and it was still packed with energetic people chatting and eating away. \u00a0I ordered the special bird - which I foolishly forget now what type it was - with a side of greens and my friend ordered the roast middlewhite and rarebit - which he raved about. \u00a0The texture of the meat was so tender and correct and the flavor was so delicious; I sucked every bit of meat off the bones until there was none left. \u00a0One of the most enjoyable and tasty dinners I've had in some time. \u00a0I will remember this one. \u00a0Not to be left out, the waiter was informative about the menu and made a great wine recommendation. \u00a0My only regret is that I was too full to try the roast bone marrow and parsley salad. \u00a0Next time.",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full review go to: wp.me/pwXBH-tC \u00a0St John \u00a0Twice as Nice The gist of it: St John serves simple, honest, delicious food that brings out the best of what its often humble ingredients can be. The dining space mirrors head chef Henderson's paired down philosophy and is reminiscent of a posh school canteen for grown-ups...in a good way. The thing about St John is that, while it's brilliant, there should be places like this in every town across the UK, where you can find well-cooked everyday dishes that won't blow the bank. It's the kind of food you might have gotten at your Nan's or Auntie's house in days gone by, and it's not rocket science, after all. If you haven't been, by all means go, if only to taste the marrow and sample one of their brilliant puddings. I just can't believe there aren't more places like this in London and elsewhere throughout Britain. Sundays at St John St John had been on my hit list for a long time \u00a0too long. So, when the weather began cooling and the days got darker, and when my stomach began craving for heart-warming comfort food, I happily discovered that St John was open for Sunday lunches. What a brilliant idea, I thought, and promptly booked myself in for the upcoming weekend. I think that most readers of this blog will already know as much (or more) about St John, and its head chef Fergus Henderson, than I do, so I will spare you all of the literally gory details here. Suffice to say that the original outpost is located just opposite the Smithfield meat market in 1994 and that the building was formerly a smokehouse. Henderson is well-known for his 'nose-to-tail eating' philosophy (in fact, this was the title of his first cookbook), and the interior of the restaurant mirrors his style of food: it is paired down, simple and honest. In 2003, Henderson and his business partner Trevor Gulliver opened a second branch, imaginatively called St John Bread and Wine, near Spitalfields market (spot the trend?). The original restaurant's baking operations had outgrown its existing baking capabilities, so this new site took care of the new baking needs and also housed a smaller, less formal restaurant serving food and drink throughout the day. As you will read further down, Mrs. LF and I so much enjoyed our first visit to St John that we immediately booked Sunday lunch for the very next week upon leaving. So this review comprises two meals on two consecutive Sundays. Meal 1: Initiation It was a typically bleak autumn afternoon as we made our way East to the City of London, gliding stealthily beneath its dragon-crowned gates in the anonymity of the Circle Line. I had only ever seen St John from the outside, and didn't realize there was a little bakery and bar on the ground floor, with the main restaurant on a slightly raised level up a small flight of stairs. We made our way up and found the place to be about half full but with a nice but quiet buzz about it. Our waitress took us to our little table for two, which was nestled very cosily against the right wall. After being given the paper menu (a good deal of the dishes change every day, with only a few fixtures/signature dishes such as the infamous marrow), we were served some bread. It was a wonderful loaf of sourdough with a great crust and bags of perfect sourdough flavor. We loved it. And one of my unofficial rules that normally holds true in restaurants is that, if the bread is excellent, there is a very good chance you're in for some good food, too. We eventually ordered and took stock of the place. It is pretty much what I expected. Stark, basic, and mostly white. Industrial looking light fixtures, bistro-style wooden chairs, paper table cloths on top of the real ones, silverware that you can tell has been well used, waiting staff in kitchen whites. But most importantly, all of the diners there seemed to be genuinely having a good time. It was a posh school canteen for grown-ups. After attempting to turn my eyes into binoculars while peering past the pass in the kitchen, to see what offal tricks these culinary wizards were conjuring, and soaking everything in, our efficient waitress came back with our starters. Starter 1: Roast Bone Marrow & Parsley SaladAnd what a starter. Phwoah \u00a0just look at those bad boys! This was the signature dish I had been waiting to order. Despite my expectations being ridiculously high for what is after all a very simple dish, I was not let down one bit. This was one of the best and most satisfying things I've shoved down my gob in recent memory. It just worked on every level. The marrow was rich and smooth, with a half liquidized fat texture. Spread across the perfectly toasted bread (which was the right thickness for the dish), sprinkled with a bit of that chunky gray salt, and topped off with a good dose of fresh parsley and onions (with a faultless vinaigrette), I was eating way too fast. You had richness that was accented by salt and shot through the heart with fresh",

    "text": "St. John Restaurant: a very important institution, as is its owner Fergus Henderson. But, and it's a big but, my only visit there was severely marred by a couple of crucial details. But first the good stuff. The space and atmosphere are great - there's an open, communal sensation and the warehouse feel, painted white, is very special. The food more or less lives up to its reputation: simple, honest, fresh, wholesome, hearty fare, with a refreshing enthusiasm for less popular meats and offal. Most of it was well presented and frankly delicious. The bread is truly superb. However, the wine list is silly: it's exclusively French (they refuse to tell you the reason for that on the website) and poorly structured. That's indefensible nowadays, especially in a famous restaurant. Every good non-culturally specific restaurant must have a global wine list, and if not, it must give clear reasons why not (for example, an Italian restaurant could defensibly have just Italian wines). This is an English or perhaps British restaurant, and therefore it ought to consider composing a wine list that reflects the variety of wines that are appealing to the British consumer. Beyond that, it has at least the obligation to present a wine list where there are no mediocre wines at all. We had two wines, one of which was decent and one of which was inconsequential, and tasted a third, which we returned because it was pathetic - like a cheap supermarket offer, something fruity, sickly and one-dimensional. It shouldn't have been on the list in the first place. The mark-up on wines is a grotesque 200% - this can be inferred from the takeaway prices that they offer. Amusingly they publish the takeaway prices on the wine list. Or perhaps not so amusingly. These absurd mark-ups are an infuriating cultural habit that the UK doesn't seem to know how to shake off. The service was abysmal. I regret to say this, because I like Fergus, and I respect his philosophy, and I love his book. But the service was just wrong. They rushed our decisions, looked impatient when we were doubting, weren't helpful, and generally put on sour expressions. A great pity. I will still return, because I'd like to eat a hog roast for 14 people there. As long as I can bring my own wine.",

    "text": "Be alert that there are several locations each with slightly different names: St John Bread & Wine vs St John Bar Restaurant. This is the latter. I almost set out to meet my coworkers at the Spittlefields market location one vs the Smithfield market one. As I overheard a table next to me comment \"St John is a PETA nightmare\". St. John is the fabled People Eating Tasty Animals variant HQ, I think.The menu presents a lot of challenges for the \"but that's NOT lasagna!\" type diners. Pigeon? Rabbit? Lamb tongue? It's the veritable Crunchy Frog skit from Monty Python (youtube.com/watch?v=Dy6u\u2026). The menu also seems to change up a lot.The decor is quite minimalist. Like draping white linen over a butcher's block. Service is all that you can expect. Instructive without being hovering or intrusive. I had the rabbit with bacon. However, there appeared to be no bacon. I can see from one photo what my rabbit and bacon should have looked like (yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Ye\u2026). Docking them \u00a0a star for missing the bacon. Shame. English bacon is exceptional.",

Highlights for me were:- Sweetbreads with bacon and peas - if you've never tried sweetbreads, I would recommend trying them here! They had a subtle flavour and the texture was quite soft and pleasant. The sauce with bacon and peas was delicious- The fresh bread served at the start of the meal, a lovely tangy sour dough- The desserts. I had a very rich, moist ginger loaf with butterscoth sauce and ice cream. It was sooo good, and the dessert wine recommended by the waitress complimented it perfectlyNot all of the dishes were to my taste, however - I personally thought the pressed ear that my dining companionion ordered was disgusting, basically fat and gristle (he thought it was 'ok'). My starter of deep-fried Lamb's fry was pleasant, but didn't wow me - it reminded me of chicken nuggets, but with a slight lamb flavour. Having said that, seeing as the Lamb's fry was lambs testicles, I liked this dish more than I was expecting to!Overall, the evening was great. The service was attentive, without being rushed, and we had the opportunity to try things we'd never normally eat.",

    "text": "How daring are you? \u00a0Will you eat any part of the animal? \u00a0If so, you will be rewarded here. \u00a0St. John isn't your normal Michelin star restaurant. \u00a0You won't break the bank here, which is nice. \u00a0Their famous Roast Bone Marrow & Parsley salad will only set you back \u00a37.20 \u00a0 Are you kidding me? \u00a0You'd be crazy not to try things you normally wouldn't at a restaurant this respected. \u00a0If you don't like it, you can always order something else at these prices. \u00a0But the thing is, you are going to like it. \u00a0You may not want to admit it but, all those bits that we Americans throw out....taste pretty yummy. \u00a0Especially in the hands of master chefs in one of the top restaurants in the world.So it all starts with this Roast Bone Marrow Parsley Salad. \u00a0It is perfection. \u00a0You take a piece of toast, dig out the pipping hot bone marrow and spread it on the toast. \u00a0It becomes almost like a melted butter with a rich beefy flavor. \u00a0Next you sprinkle a little corse sea salt and then top with fresh parsley that has a little olive oil on it. \u00a0You have all different textures and flavors working together in harmony. \u00a0I split this with my brother and I would say that's the way to go because it's so rich. \u00a0Plus now you can also order the Terrine and split that too.The terrine was out of this world. \u00a0Like eating a cool meatloaf of sausage but only made with the tastiest ingredients. \u00a0St. John's terrine is pork, duck, rabbit offal, with a little foie gras thrown in to hold it all together. \u00a0It was served with very crunchy little gherkin pickles. \u00a0My brother felt that they over powered the terrine. \u00a0I enjoyed some bites with the pickle and some without. \u00a0I like the crunchy texture of the pickles with the terrine and the flavor together was something completely different than just the terrine. \u00a0It was great to go back and forth, because the terrine by itself was just fabulous.I also enjoyed watching my wife struggle shelling her crayfish. \u00a0I'm not sure what she was expecting, but they were large and came out looking at you. \u00a0You aren't going to win a staring competition with these guys.After reading reviews here about the main courses, it seems those that play it safe aren't super impressed with St. John. \u00a0Those who take some chances and trust the chef, are. \u00a0I really wanted to order the blood cake topped with eggs that Anthony Bourdain has bragged about over and over, but unfortunately they only have it on the menu every 2 or 3 weeks, and we hit a night where it wasn't available. \u00a0So I went with the grilled ox heart. \u00a0This was sliced very thin, well marinated, and grilled to get some char lines on each slice. \u00a0It had a bold flavor to it and kind of reminded me of a lean carne asada steak. \u00a0Pretty darn tasty and served with chips.My brother's dish however completely stole the show. \u00a0Lamb Sweetbreads. \u00a0Don't ask questions, just eat it. \u00a0It's one of the best things I've ever tried. \u00a0These soaked up whatever they were saut\u00e9ed in so well. \u00a0The sauce was amazing. \u00a0This dish also had large pieces of bacon, more like pork belly as it wasn't crispy. \u00a0Again it soaked up and added to the flavor of the dish. \u00a0Each forkful of the sweetbread, bacon, and turnip together, was perfection. \u00a0How I wanted to steal his dish.My wife played it safe, got the lamb cutlets and I don't think she was that impressed. \u00a0The lamb, while perfectly prepared was on the bland side. \u00a0She isn't a bean eater and she didn't eat the lamb together with the beans. \u00a0I tried the lamb and the beans together and thought it was very good. \u00a0Sometimes with British food, you need to make what my mother called sandwiches on the fork. \u00a0Just grab a bit of this and that and mash it all together on the fork. \u00a0Once you did that with this dish, it was quite good, but not in the same league as the Lamb Sweetbreads.We split a very powerful Welsh rarebit as a side. \u00a0This is a few different cheeses melted on toast along with some English mustard and Worcestershire sauce. \u00a0I highly recommend getting a slice to share as it's one of the best I've had.For desert, I stayed traditionally English with Strawberry, Cream, and Biscuit. \u00a0The Strawberry jelly was packed with flavor and was on the runny side once the outer layer was broken. \u00a0The clotted creme wasn't too sweet, but didn't need to be since it's purpose was to enhance the strong sweet strawberry jelly with richness. \u00a0The biscuit added a little need crunch, and there you have it.Master Chef and owner Fergus Henderson, was dining here this night with his family. \u00a0I wanted to walk over and shake his hand and thank him for such a wonderful experience, but didn't want to bother the man. \u00a0So here's a yelp thank you to him and his restaurant, for opening my eyes and palate to the other tasty bits that we don't get to eat very often.",

The bone marrow was good, but more oily than anything else. The smoked herring was average. The cod roe toast was disappointing. The veal breast was tender and probably the best dish I had.",

We were so disappointed and now I start doubting everything Bourdain recommends in his show.",

Fergus is apparently some sort of British messiah for nose to tail eating and if you're into that sort of thing, you won't be disappointed. Having grown up in a Cantonese family where it was normal to suck the meat out of fish heads, to fight for the last braised chicken foot, or to rate a restaurant's tripe offerings, this was heaven for me. The wife and I started with the bone marrow. Marrow has been a fad for some time now, and while we were a bit torn about ordering it (having had plenty of marrow over the last two years), we were very impressed. While the marrow was roasted well, it was the parsley salad that accompanied it that put it over the top. So fresh and fragrant, with a hint of vinegar as well. It was the perfect accompaniment to the rich and unctuous bone marrow.The wife had the lamb sweetbreads and I had the grilled ox heart. Both were outstanding. The sweetbreads were so complex- earthy, coppery, and buttery. The simple and straightforward peas and mashed potatoes that accompanied it balanced that complexity very well. The ox heart was robust, beefy, and very tender. The frites and accompanied it were also some of the best we've had during our trip (which included more than a few places in Paris). The finale was the date pudding suggested by the waitress. We weren't accustomed to English-style puddings and we thought it might be too rich. We were so wrong. Every bite was sweet, but not overly so. The cream mellowed the richness perfectly. Awesome!St. John's was such a delight for us. We will be coming back the next time we're in London.",

    "text": "The reviews for this restaurant have been all over the place lately, and because of that I very nearly didn't book a table here. In fact, I waited until we were actually in London to contact the restaurant to see if we could get a table. After some email back and forth with a very nice woman we were squared away for 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday night. After a long day of site seeing we arrived early for our reservation, but we were seated immediately with no fuss. I really enjoyed the spare decor and the layout of the restaurant. When we first sat down, we were one of only a handful of diners but by the time we left the place was packed. Like all good gastronomes, we started our dinner off with the bone marrow. It was good. In fact, it was the best darn bone marrow I'd ever had. But ... I just don't think I'm a bone marrow kind of gal. Too much effort (strangely, I love picking at Dungeness crab). Next came our main dishes - I ordered the grouse and the husband ordered a pork dish served with a really lovely sauce and stewed dates (or something like that). I would have taken pictures but the menu clearly states that no cameras are allowed. Unlike some people posting here, I chose to observe the request.I can see here that not many liked the grouse. Myself? I'm very happy I ordered it. Our waiter warned that it was an adventurous bit of protein and that it was rather gamey. If I wanted roast chicken, I would have stayed home and cooked one myself. You go to St. John to taste something you haven't had before. At least that's the way I look at it. The grouse WAS gamey, but it was also so very interesting with so many different flavors in each and every bite. I would definitely order it again.We finished our meal with a wonderful holiday-esque dessert which is currently escaping my memory as all I can think about is how truly eye opening the grouse was. If I were to return to London, I would definitely go back to St. John.",

The few bites I had of my dining partner's dish seemed to have been cooked just right.Potted beef and pickled cabbage on the yummiest bread made in-house everday (so I was told) seriously tho, that bread! I won the starters round, it was a perfect portion but it was very morish.Well, we actually started with a glass of champagne, but that was just a sneaky starter, shush ;)Mains then came, sweetbreads for my friend and pigeon pour moi.The sweetbreads has this creaminess to them that I would never have expected paired with the crispy lardons and slightly crunchy peas in that sauce was just magical!Pigeon was served simply and rare with a beautiful braised chicory. Although my pigeon was delicious, Naomi won the mains round... I didn't expect the sweetbreads to be that fantastic.All washed down with a delish house red.Dessert... nom nom nom.Gingerbread loaf, butterscotch sauce and icecream... But what made this even nicer was that we asked our server for an aperitif to compliment the dish and we both have different tastes so he suggested two different ones. \u00a0You all need to try the Pineau des Charentes! Just even put your nose in it and the smell is divine!I had an amazing lunch on my last day in London visiting an old friend in between work so I was over the moon that I stumbled by accident into the place a couple of nights prior looking for a place to chill while waiting to catch up with said friend.I forgot to get their names but to the lovely lady who served me my g&t that night and told be about \"zetter townhouse\" thank you, you were right, it was totally up my alley and they were nearly as nice as you guys.To the very charming man who served us at lunch, it's really great to have someone who is knowledgeable about flavours and indeed about different palates and what will suit different clients. Thanks a million to you all at St.John!Sooz x",

    "text": "I work around the corner from St. John, and I walk by it frequently on my way home, but it wasn't until I read about their great feasting menus that I was pushed into action. I organized a Christmas banquet for 22 people with their extremely helpful events coordinator, and the whole process could not have gone more smoothly. After a long exchange of emails and a \u00a3435 deposit taken approximately 2 week before the feast date, I arrived with my guests and we were seated and served promptly, and very well attended to. It was not at all overwhelming to have so many people when everything was taken care of and so organized. We had the ox tongue salad as a starter, which was not described in the menu and to my surprise was a hearty panzanella type salad with a lot of bread pieces and large slices of ox tongue that most people probably thought was beef anyway! The hog was then brought over to our table and we had the opportunity to take many photos with it, before our server carved it heartily and brought heaping plates of the meat over to our table. We also had bread and onion stuffing, some boiled leafy greens and potatoes as sides. The server came by and asked us if we wanted any top ups of the sides, so we got some extra greens as well. I was also fairly impressed that the 22 of us polished off every last bit of food; the large pig really does feed that many and probably no more, if you want to truly have a feast size portion! We had apple crumble and custard for dessert. The crumble was served in a large porcelain dish and we had small jars of custard, of which we also asked for extra. It was a great end to the meal. The food could not have been better, the service was excellent, and everything went incredibly smoothly. Thanks St John for an awesome experience; we would definitely consider making this an annual thing!",

I knew this was a place for adventurous meat and I think I was just not ready for this. The grouse was so awful that I only took three bites of it. It still had this 'nature' and 'animal' flavor that I can't get rid of. That's the worst part of the dinner.The good part of the dinner was the bone marrow. It was good, but again, just good. The best part of the night was, the madeleine. Warm and fluffy, not too sweet and fresh from the oven. Not a single meat, no venison, no rabbit, no grouche. For a moment, I felt the blissfulness of being just a vegetarian. I was not blaming St John for my experience, it was kinda funny and interesting and we laughed it away, and it taught me one important lesson, that I would stick with a normal kind of meat anyday rather than being too adventurous.

    "text": "So. This is awkward...This place is a legend, especially amongst meat lovers. I had lustily reviewed their menu and Yelp reviews for days before our work do. And then we arrived and waited with bated breaths for the gastronomic delights to follow. I liked the simple but clean decor - busy but spacious settings, urban chic but stolidly British in its insistence on simple white table clothes and table silver - no unnecessary accoutrements, candles and the likes. Very well then.Their own-brand wine was lovely and the bread was delightful, and we gushed and exchanged bottles across our huge group split between two long tables...we munched on the bread and wondered where our food was...considering we had pre-ordered days in advance with specific dietary requirements et al.It finally arrived, and we were delighted with the unusual starter dish of bone marrow - it was a bit of an adventure picking on the soft bits with our long pokers, how very unusual we marvelled. And then the mains arrived - giant tubs of shepherds pie with, well, more bone marrow. Exotic, the first time around, but a bit 'more of the same' by now. Other mains included other giant shareable portions of veggies, gammon and other dishes...sadly, the shareable, communal dining format really detracted from the presentation aspect of the meal, which is really such an essential part of enjoying fine dining, especially in Western cuisines. All in all, for what had been anticipated to be a very memorable meal, it ended up being rather 'meh'. Pudding was nice, I think, but I think I was already a bit put out by then so I can't remember much of it.I really really wanted to like this place. The experience, unfortunately, collapsed under the weight of my expectations...maybe a la carte would be a better experience than a pre-ordered, big group event? Who knows...but I am not dying to get back to this place any time soon to correct my potential misconception.",

There is simply nothing that can compare to bone marrow on toast ... end of story.For our mains, we had the skate wing and the chitterlings or pig intestines. \u00a0The skate was excellent, however it did have some pieces of bread that were just soaked in oil (I mean we're talking BP oil spill level) which I felt was unnecessary. \u00a0The chitterlings were a surprise having had pig intestines in the past. \u00a0The presentation looked nothing like my previous encounter with this \"organ\" ... in fact, I wouldn't have known it was intestines had I not verified it with our server. \u00a0Not to say that it wasn't great, it certainly was good ... but not quite what I expected. \u00a0Perhaps I was expecting a slightly less refined version (in presentation and taste) ... nonetheless it tasted fine just not mind blowing. For dessert, we had the cherry tart and homemade ice cream - which was a great way to finish off this amazing meal. \u00a0The ice cream was rich and creamy and it complemented the cherries very nicely.Overall, we had an amazing experience at one of the top \"foodie temples\" in the planet. \u00a0If you are adventurous with your cuisine and happen to find yourself in London ... do not (I repeat do not) miss the opportunity to dine at one of the top 50 restaurants in the world ... \u00a0you will not be disappointed. \u00a0Keeping an open mind certainly helps while perusing the menu ... lucky for me this doesn't apply since I have bone marrow as a component of my last meal on earth.",

The bartender was very helpful, from recommending a delicious beverage (cidre breton. How I wish I could get it in Pittsburgh.) to letting me use the house phone to call their other location to see if our friends had ended up there.As soon as I dialed the other location, our friends walked in. Fantastic! Now we can eat. Do you know how hard it is to pick a meal on a menu that includes venison liver, mallard, braised rabbit and ox cheeks? We started with the bone marrow appetizer. I'd never had bone marrow, but it was everything Anthony Bourdain had led me to expect. Rich, buttery, flavorful (although the flavor was subtle). Then I decided to order the rabbit and my husband the ox cheeks - but the ox cheeks were sold out, so he got the rabbit and I got the venison liver. Good decision - I didn't love the rabbit (there's something about the texture that I don't like), but the venison was sublime. If you like venison, which I do. Our friends ordered the mallard (loved the wing, was less impressed with the breast) and the quail (glad he tried it, but didn't enjoy the flavor). And then, of course, we had to try desert: My husband and I shared the apple crumble with custard, which I thought was the best thing I'd ever eaten in my life until I tried a bite of my friend's lemon posset, which was even better.Great service, great food. Expensive, yes, but not out of line with the quality and the experience. So glad we decided to give it a shot!",

From the design (interior, wine label, menu, Twitter account, website, etc etc etc) to the food itself, everything here clearly has the level of attention any excellent experience requires.We started at the bar, where i didn't have the opportunity to try the variety of different beers available because i felt obliged (in a good way) to try the restaurants own wine. After trying it (extensively) i can confirm that it does indeed work. It tastes good too.I opted for the bone marrow as a starter (which was wind-blowingly good) and went for the pigeon for my main course. I ended with an espresso.A note about the pigeon: while i wasn't such a huge fan of the bird/meat I thoroughly enjoyed eating something so perfectly prepared. Also, i was rather surprised to discover just how much meat a pigeon actually offers. I would not recommend pigeon for unadventurous eaters. If however you appreciate food for all it's qualities (how it's prepared, cooked and to experience a new flavour) I would strongly recommend it.While my experience was fantastic, to do things right one needs to reserve an entire suckling pig a week in advance and bring 10 friends, for this is what St John are really known for. I've given St John 5 stars based on it's entire experience, not simply it's food VS price ratio. Follow them on Twitter @SJRestaurant",

It wasn't bad but it just did not live up to its name and hype. The bone marrow wasn't all that special and it was quite a bit of work to scoop out the marrow. I had a similar dish in Paris that was better, in taste and mechanics. My lamb entree was cold and taste-less. Maybe I ordered wrong or perhaps it was having an off-day. The hot chocolate pudding, however, is one of the best desserts I have ever had.",

    "text": "St. John Restaurant is rated #14 on the world restaurant ranking. I really wanted to try it. As I'm here in London and The Fat Duck is fully booked for the next 2 months, I decided on second best and I found my way there tonight.Entering, I was greeted by a traditional, almost working-class ambiance. White walls wilth pegs on the walls all around the room to hang coats. Painted floors, paper table cloths on serviceable furniture. Common silverware. No bread plates. OK. This wasn't about the ambiance. I was greeted by the fellow running the place. Seated immediately, he returned in a few minutes to take my order. The menu was very \"English\" meaning lots of offal, eel, and the types of fish preparations we don't often see in the US.I began with a glass of NV St John Brut Rose. It wasn't bad. Nice fruit, good nose. For my appetizer I went with the Hake & Monk's Beard. I'd never had Monk's Beard, a vegetable grown on northern European coastal lands. It looks a bit like fettucini but green. The hake came served in flakes and chunks. Both were tossed in a bit of lemon with capers. Unfortunately I didn't realize the dish was served cold. I'm not big on cold fish but I braved it. The dish had little flavor and the flavor of the fish was more to the nose than the tongue. I didn't care for it.For my entree I decided on Beef Mince & Tatties. A traditional Scottish dish, Mince is minced beef with spices and tatties are simply boiled potatoes. A side of greens was a dish of outer cabbage leaves lightly cooked. The greens were done perfectly. The beef was fine and boiled potatoes...well, they're boiled potatoes. The dish had very little real flavor. This seemed to be the theme for the dinner...a lack of real flavors. A glass of Cotes du Rhone Villages (2007) accompanied the entree course. The wine was fine.My waitress brought my food, picked up my plates and asked me what I wanted. Perfunctory. No personality...just like the food and ambiance.Dessert was the Apple Pie & Custard and it was the highlight of the night. Heavy sweet crust certainly outweighed the apples but still it offered flavor. Espresso and done.What a disappointment. I can't believe the ranking, the Michelin star or the reviews on Yelp. This is simply mediocre stuff.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a very unique feel to it. Since Anthony Bourdain said Fergus Henderson's bone marrow and parsley salad was the last thing he would eat if he was on death row made me curious and to try it. So we ordered it and it was good, but I've had better. However, Fegus is the one who started the whole movement on eating from head to toe parts of animals, so other chefs could have changed this classic dish. We also ordered the crispy pig skin with water cress salad and I never had anything like it. I'm not a big fan of pigs skin and water cress, but the dressing, the way he toasted the skin made this dish so delicious and I was surprised how much I liked it. I've had water cress cooked before and never ate it raw, but my god, it was appetizing. We also ordered the brown crab on toast and all it is roe mixed with crab meat which gave it that creamy, buttery taste and it went excellent with the toast. \u00a0The apple crumble was scrumptious. Came right out of the oven, scorching hot with creme on the side, which made the dessert more like a bread pudding. So delicious, but the menu has other things that they are more famous for, but i was craving for an apple crumble. I had a great dining experience and I'd definitely come back. What made the experience even better was seeing Fergus actually there, so we bought his book and had him sign it. Extremely talented man and very nice.",

    "text": "If you are looking for the quintessential British meal, your search ends now.I very much enjoyed my meal at St John Bread and Wine in Spitalfields a couple years ago, so I was looking forward to dining at the proper restaurant location in Farringdon. We booked a reservation at St John for my boyfriend's birthday, as he always wanted to dine at St John and we all wanted to try it out as well. When we arrived at the restaurant, we waited for a brief moment at the bar and enjoyed a bottle of the house white, which I HIGHLY recommend, especially for the summer. Close to the bar downstairs is also the bakery and a small seating area, which was quite quaint and lovely. As we finally took our seats, I immediately noticed all of the exotic meats on the menu, none which I had ever seen someone consume. The majority of our party all agreed that they wanted the bone marrow (the restaurant's speciality). The whole table agreed that it was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend also ordered the pigeon, which he found very unique but tasty as well. As a vegetarian, I stuck to the simple rocket salad and a few of the side orders. The desert menu was absolutely DIVINE. As a table, we wanted to try everything, so we each ordered a different desert. I must recommend the chocolate pot for all you choco-lovers out there. Simply it is dark chocolate melted into a tiny little pot, which looks quite small when it arrives, However, do not be deceived! It is EXTREMELY rich (but so delicious). A complete must.Overall, for the dining experience, service, and quality of food, I was shocked at the reasonable prices. I will be back very soon!",

    "text": "This place should be a mandatory visit for all Italian and French tourists snootily landing in the capital thinking that it's a beautiful city where people eat crappy food. The fact that a restaurant like this exists, and it's wildly successful, is a great proof not only of the quality and variety of the offer in the city, but also of the maturity in the taste of the London gourmets.I hesitate in describing this as \"british\" cuisine. In fact, it's a temple of meat, where most of the dishes are cooked with the simplicity and efficacy of home-made Italian food. More than one dish I tasted there reminded me of something that my mother cooks regularly, or that my grandmother used to cook: insofar that I was tempted to go to the kitchen and suggest some creative use of beef lungs or kidneys.The main source of this similarity comes from the fact that most of the dishes at the Sain't John are prepared with less valuable cuts of meat, from what skilful hands extract unexpected (and potentially unfamiliar) tastes through masterful cooking and simple matchings. There are no intrusive sauces trying to cover the taste of the meat: most of the courses are presented in their utter simplicity, and for a real meat lover this is the perfect way to do it.I ordered the ox heart: I love ox heart, my mother used to do that often with parsley and wine. This was just as good. I briefly tasted the beetroot and horseradish that came on the side, but for me (while tasty) they were redundant. I had the opportunity to taste the famous bone marrow (and don't get me started with how bone marrow is central to the Milanese cuisine both for the \"ossobuco con polenta\" and the properly done \"risotto alla milanese\") and found it delicious, but it's the chitterlings that I found really amazing, reminding me of tastes that I experienced in my life on a few happy occasions, particularly in some wonderful restaurants in Rome. We picked a random wine from the very good list and it turned out to be a perfect matching. Prices very, very good for this kind of quality, surely helped by the minimalist fittings and the somewhat hasty attitude of the waiters. Even the coffee was good, what could I ask more?",

Luckily there was place - for the entire week there was only one timeslot available! So we quickly booked our reservation.A few reviewers have described the restaurant well as unassuming. We actually passed the restaurant by accident when trying to find it. When you enter there is a bar and bakery downstairs and it was packfull when we came for our 6:30pm reservation. At first we were nervous that we couldn't get a table, but luckily we soon realized the restaurant is upstairs!I was really curious to see the menu because online it changes daily. The menu ranged from safe to daring. I mean, it is a restaurant that specializes in offal. For starters my husband took the famous roasted bone marrow with toast and parsley salad and it was amazing. I love venison and celeriac, so when I saw the combo together I had to take it as my starter.Now for the mains... This is where I wanted to be a bit daring. I had read about British faggots, which are basicaly meatballs made from the kidney, liver, and heart of the animal of choice, and decided to order the goat faggots. It was a lot of newness for me, but I thought if I'm going to try them, this is the place. I can't say I loved them but it was all a part of the experience. I did love my husband's dish - roasted pork shoulder with trotters and prunes - yum!So not only did we enjoy the food, but the staff was so friendly and helpful! And questions we had about the menu everyone (not just our waitress) was more than willing to help!So if you're headed to London and want real British food, you must come to St. John!",

The octopus salad was polarizing from real disgust to actual fans... You must like octopus to enjoy. The giancale (pork cheek) with dandelion was also a crowd fave...maybe the best surprise of all was the Eccles cakes for desserts which my in-laws informed me was also referred to as hamentaschen (sic)...

    "text": "After much anticipation, I was excited (even a little scared) about our dinner for St. John. \u00a0Having seen pictures about the various animal parts, strange dishes, and other weird but delicious food, I was going into this with a very open mind. \u00a0I will caveat things right by saying that a) I'm an American, who doesn't venture too far beyond meat and potatoes for a main and b) as a result of the former, I tend to think that I have a rather \"limited\" palate when it comes to various types of game.Ok, so anyway, now that I've put that out there, here's what went down during our meal. \u00a0The scene wasn't what i was expecting, it was on the louder side, but very casual, and very open-aired. \u00a0Service right from the onset was mediocre. \u00a0In aggregate, our waitress probably visited our table about 4 times the whole time we were there, some of which was a function of us trying to flag her down. \u00a0Anyway, we had scoped out the menu beforehand so we knew almost right away what we were going to be ordering.For the appetizers, we ordered the following:Brown shrimp and cabbage salad: When they say \"shrimp\", they mean itty bitty bay shrimp, not the shrimp you get in shrimp cocktail (those are prawns). \u00a0The salad was fresh and light, but not anything to write how about.Bone marrow salad: \u00a0WELL OF COURSE WE WERE GOING TO GET THIS. \u00a0The components of this dish were outstanding together. \u00a0The bones were served hot with a few pieces of toast, some parsley salad and onion, with some sea salt on the side. \u00a0The bone marrow comes out spreadable on the toast, and when you make yourself a small sandwich, this is absolutely delicious. \u00a0The only qualm I have about this dish is that it's definitely on the messy side. \u00a0You will DEFINITELY need your napkin.Mains:Greg had a venison dish served with a side of mash, and I ordered the grousse.Here's where my naive mind thought of prior to ordering: \u00a0Grousse, being a bird, must be similar to chicken.Reality check: Grousse and chicken may both be birds, but that's about as far as it goes in terms of similarity. \u00a0There was a fair amount of clove spices on the bird, and I absolutely butchered it throughout the process trying to find bits and pieces that were edible. \u00a0Grousse meat is most definitely game-y in my opinion. \u00a0It's dark, with a lot of \"nature\" tastes to it. \u00a0Although I thought I did a good job getting through most of it, I'd be lying if I said that I completely enjoyed it. \u00a0Again, maybe this is because I'm just not used to eating overly gamey meats, but I just couldn't turn the corner and start enjoying it. \u00a0Greg, on the other hand, seriously enjoyed his venison dish. \u00a0We had gone to Harwood Arms for dinner earlier on, and Greg thought his dish a St John outdid his dish at Harwood.Desserts:Buttermilk pudding: Holy cow this was delicious. \u00a0Not really 5 star delicious, but it was definitely good! \u00a0I would certainly order this againBlackberry swirl ice cream: what surprised me the most about this was how much ice cream they gave you! \u00a0That was seriously impressive!Anyway, after all of this, I just couldn't get around the idea that I didn't really enjoy my main. \u00a0I don't want to be overly critical of the place since some of this may certainly be a function of my palate, but it seems to me that places where I've given 4+ stars out is because i was blown away with whatever main I had. \u00a0I guess I don't quite get that here. \u00a0Overall, I thought this was a 5 star experience, but only a 3 star assessment for the food.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: This is my favorite restaurant. But they're not paying me to say that.I've eaten at St John (this Smithfield location) at least ten times, and I don't even live in the UK. It is my most anticipated meal (and second meal) every trip I take to London. The food and the beer selection are flawless time after time, and I love that it's located close to my favorite pub (the Jerusalem Tavern). You do not need a reservation to eat in the \"bar,\" which is where I have dined all but one time, if it's just you or you plus one. I think that you get a full dinner menu in the \"restaurant,\" but to be honest the food available in the bar is what I'm after anyway! Come right around 5pm to get your pick of tables and enjoy a very relaxing meal. The early-evening atmosphere here, at least in summer, is fantastic.And as far as atmosphere, St John is supremely comfortable. I have usually eaten here alone, and never felt awkward or out of place. The bar and the dining room are both more casual than you might expect; I once wore a dress and heels here and felt overdressed. The space is minimally decorated and the focus is 100% on the food. I think that the reasonable prices reflect this; there's no \"fine dining\" posturing here.I can't leave without eating two things: the roast bone marrow and the terrine. These dishes have been consistent meal after meal, year after year, and are two of the most deliciously satisfying menu items you will ever taste. Another favorite when available is the pigskin salad. I once ate two orders of it, in addition to roast bone marrow and Welsh rarebit, by myself. When I brought my father here, we ordered ox heart with chips, and it was also wonderful. Brown shrimp on toast, snails & chorizo, grilled sprats with celeriac salad, eccles cake & cheese... it has all been great.I understand that they have a good wine list here, but I am only interested in beer. They usually offer Meantime ales, which I happen to love, and the servers never get pushy with wine or with \"pairing\" my food, which I appreciate. Speaking of the servers, they deserve a word. All but one time, the service at St John has been excellent for me. That one time that was an exception, I had a waiter who was quite condescending and didn't check on us/bring the check for nearly 30 minutes after serving main courses. I can't drop my review because of the one time, and I have not seen that server at the restaurant again.In my opinion, this is not an overpriced dining spot. I am never shocked when I see the amount show up in USD$ on my bank statement, and I have never once felt ripped off. A joy every time... and I'll be back in October!",

    "text": "This place is very unsuspecting from the facade but I like this place so damn much that it was one of the most memorable meals of my recent trip to London. The interior is downplayed and understated. The atmosphere is somewhat rustic and unpretentious. It was like the chef and owner decided to turn a small market or industrial warehouse into a worthy restaurant. And worthy it is of its one Michelin star rating.The menu changes daily and St John's concept is nose-to-tail eating. So if you're in for trying offal and innards, you're in for a delicious time here. Even if you're not so into offal, still give it a try-- who knows, you might leave as a convert?Roasted bone marrow: Very, very good. Spread it on your toast, sprinkle some sea salt over it, and garnish with parsley.Lamb testicles: Is ok to brag that I've eaten lamb testicles now?! It was the special of the day so I'm assuming they don't have that everyday. Bbattered and deep fried, they came with a side of strong garlic dip. The testicles very definitely interesting and had a solid texture to it. I really liked the strong garlic dip with the fried testicles.Crispy pig cheek and dandelion: I dreamt for days about the pig cheeks after our meal at St John. The pieces of pig cheeks came with the pork crackling attached. The crackling was perfect and crisp, and the meat from the cheek melted in the mouth. Such contrasting textures... and so memorable.Braised tripe:Prior to this, I've only had tripe at Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese restaurants and they're usually on the chewy side with a crunch. Not at St John. The tripe here is the smoothest, most tender, and softest I've had. If anyone gets nervous at the thought of eating tripe and hasn't tried it yet, St John's braised tripe is an excellent introduction to one's palate. The braised dish came with white beans and pieces of pork belly. It was deep in flavor.Definitely worth a return trip.",

And this place is known for the variety of exotic meats and I came here for the famous bone marrow salad.You will not get any more fat from any other substance in the world except from the bone marrow found here. It's a very nice consistency of an almost gelatin like, but liquidity fatty goodness.And when you couple that with a few pinches of sea salt, you will feel like you are in another dimension filled with candies, unicorns and rainbows.But once I got out of that fatty hallucination, I decided to go on with the main course with the braised rabbit, bacon and mustard. This dish definitely got me back to a normal balance. Definitely not as fatty as the bone marrow. But at least it was filled with the necessary proteins to overcome said fattiness from earlier.And the rabbit was nice and tender. It was more like a minestrone soup that came with some beans. This is a good choice if you come here. \u00a0I highly recommend coming down here and trying out some of their exotic items on the menu.",

    "text": "nope, nope, nope.Disappointing in several ways. \u00a0First of all, for a place with a pig as its mascot and \"snout to tail\" as its motto, there was no pig on the menu. \u00a0No snout. \u00a0No tail. \u00a0Nothing at all.Second, the dishes our party ordered were all mediocre at best. \u00a0Ox liver was two thin slices of liver, served dry over some plain beets. \u00a0Not tasty. \u00a0Hospital food. \u00a0Sweetbreads were so very ordinary. \u00a0And on and on. \u00a0Dishes were served neither with interesting sauces or spices, nor were they served with an emphasis on fresh, delicious, and plain cuts cooked simply to emphasize their simple deliciousness. \u00a0Preparation of our 3 apps and 3 mains reminded me of the kind of mindfulness that goes into college dining-hall food and airplane food. \u00a0The desserts we saw on our neighbors' plates looked pretty boring, so we didn't bother.Third, the service was terrible. \u00a0We waited so very long between our dishes, and at no point during the meal did a waiter ask us how it was going. \u00a0Our waitress disappeared for a long time, and we could see her eating something in the kitchen. \u00a0We finished our drinks, and no server was around for at least 30 minutes, to ask us if we wanted another. \u00a0Don't they want to make money? \u00a0(Oddly, when the waitress was clearing our dishes at the end of the meal she asked if I would like another glass of wine. \u00a0Yes I did! \u00a045 minutes ago when you were absent!)What a failure. \u00a0We watched a beautiful roast suckling pig being carried past us and into another room. \u00a0Maybe the VIP's in that room were receiving the food and the service I had been expecting? \u00a0The black pudding and breakfast sausage I had with my breakfast fry-up at my local pub was better than anything I had at St John tonight! \u00a0And HP sauce would have improved most of this bland and unimaginative food.",

    "text": "We did our best to not be disappointed. We really did.My husband and I aren't famous or overly hipsterish. We're not British. What we are are lovers of great food and great wine and warm hospitality at reasonable prices. So whenever we travel, that's we look for.We chose St. John to end a long week of business/sightseeing in London on the always dependable recommendation of another Bay Area foodie friend. We willingly accepted a late reservation on a Friday, and prepared ourselves for what we were sure would be a memorable end to our trip.When we arrived for our 9:30 reservation, the gracious but harried house manager asked if we'd mind waiting at the bar a few minutes for our table. We waited for nearly half an hour, checking out the hipster crowd which added color and spice to the austere decor. We also had plenty of time to watch as a waiter began drawing lines through all the bar menu dishes no longer available. As the manager apologized for the wait and seated us in the dining room, making reference to a \"crazy night\", \u00a0I made a point of saying that I knew the wait would be worth it and not to worry.Soon our waitress came by and, with a lot of grace, proceeded to take us down the menu to note all the things *they* were out of (it was at least a quarter of the menu). The menu formatting didn't help us recognize some of the dish components on our own, so we had to ask for her her help, which she cheerfully gave, even though she was working several large parties, as well as one table very close to us where a seriously A-list British actor was sitting with a friend. She apologized for being so bus, \u00a0and mentioned that they'd been understaffed all night. Once again, I was gracious and reassured her that dining within spitting distance of [famous name omitted because he's apparently a regular] was consolation enough. I meant it. At least, I wanted to mean it.We settled on our dishes, only for the waitress to have to come back and offer substitution suggestions because, what do you know, they were out of some of what we'd ordered. So how was the food?My husband's salad with the substituted crispy pig's skin was fantastic, while my starter of a series of small whole fish with horseradish potatoes was great too (even if I had to crunch my way through quite a few bones. Didn't have the courage to ask if that was as designed or not).My rabbit dish was good, although in what I'm sure it typical for this kind of eating, a little unwieldy and not yielding as much edible rabbit as I'd hoped.The sauce was delicious, but the garlic was certainly on the aggressive side.Can't remember my husband's main dish, but the a la carte greens we ordered to accompany it (because in typical British fashion, it's an a la carte menu) were good, albeit tough/possibly undercookedA different waiter came by to take our dessert order and when I tried to ask him about the backstory on the name of one dish, he was more than a little snide and just too cool for words. In the end, the dessert options seemed rather pedestrian and while our molten chocolate cake was great (and large!), it wasn't anything new or different to be sure. By the time we finally flagged someone down to pay the bill, it was past eleven o'clock. (That plus the good bottle of wine we had likely explains why I literally can't remember what my husband's main course was. Again, trying to be charitable.)The pricing for our meal was far from unreasonable, which is a major plus for a city that still charges a pretty penny/pound for a good meal, even with the favorable exchange rate. But what surprised me was, after all the crazy - the long wait, the shambles of a menu - not a thing was comped. Nary an apology was offered. They just took our money and that was that. I won't begin to know what caused them to run out of so much of their menu and be so short staffed on a Friday night. I don't think the level of experience we had was just because we weren't as famous as Mr. Famous Actor at the next table. But what I do know is if a Ruth Reichl or Pete Wells-type reviewer had had our experience, they'd unload one of their \"over hyped, underwhelming\" reviews on the place. I know good restaurants have bad nights. I also know that good restaurants acknowledge they're having a bad night with something other than a few mumbled words of apology. I did have a good story to tell my kids about seeing You Know Who from those movies they love, though.",

    "text": "GO! Okay, I admit it, walking into this place was a little bit off-putting. The basic white exterior is lackluster, the way inside isn't quite clear, and the stark white interior was quite asylum-like. But wow, the food. There was not one bad bite in our very large meal. I had the snail salad and the rabbit. There was just the right amount of snail in the salad, and it didn't have that \"a little too natural\" taste that is sometimes a turn-off, it was delicious. The rabbit was perfection, and I was \"this close\" to ordering another one. My partner got the pork terrine and a fish plate (which he said was \"cooked and sliced perfectly\"). My partner raved about how the fish was prepared actually, I should point out (\"expertly sliced\" he said once or twice). We both had stupid smiles on our faces this entire meal. \"Oh my god, you have to try this ...\" that kinda thing.The whole thing was presently wonderfully by our waiter, Jon, \u00a0who was very knowledgeable and honest with his suggestions and helping us decide what to get in the first place. He was also just plain adorable - tall and adorable.Finally, desserts. I got the Honey/Walnut Ice Cream. GET IT. It's an ice cream that eats like a meal all by itself. It was chunky, hearty and a perfect \"winter\" ice cream, if that makes sense. My partner's pear sorbet was also great. So, yeah. Go!",

The bone marrow was everything and more; delectable and oddly delicate, there was enough in that appetizer my husband ordered for both of us. I had the pig's head terrine which was good but not as good as the marrow. And it only got better from there.You must be a meat-eater to appreciate this tail-to-hoof restaurant or why bother coming? Yes, they have greens but that's not their speciality. And be adventurous for god sake's or just go down to the local pub and have a meat pie. This is a foodie joint, true to the word. Even the waitress got excited explaining the entrees (it's cuz she saw me do my Happy Food Dance). Anyway, absolutely worth all the accolades. We would have come again but it does put a dent in your wallet and London is already one of the most expensive cities in the world so the one time was bliss.",

The place is relaxed and airy, staff and customers are chilled and diverse (I was afraid I was going to be in the middle of an ocean of suits, but it was actually very informal) the food was excellent and the service one of the fastest Ive seen in expensive restaurants. We had the marrow bone, bloodcake and ox heart and everything was fautless, tasty and unfussy. I would hapilly eat anything that comes out of that kitchen. Their freshly baked madeleines are sublime, a glorious ending to any meal. Overall, definitively recommended. It is a bit pricey, but not too much if you bear in mind the location, teh standards and the fact that it is a bit of an institution (70 quid for two with some beer and wine, and I can think of places where you pay twice as much and you dont leave as happy as we lwere after our lunch at St Johns).",

    "text": "As I've mentioned in other reviews - and which bears repeating - I am a worthy disciple of the St John restaurant. \u00a0St John's (or chef Fergus Henderson's) famed ethos of \"nose to tail eating\" has transformed British cuisine - at least among foodies (and particularly restaurant critics). \u00a0It is now a gastronomic pleasure to seek out and indulge in delicacies such as ox tongue, calf brains, kidneys and bone marrow. \u00a0But while I'm a liver-eating fool and have loved bone marrow since first trying it years ago (in NYC), even I recoil a bit at certain offal (ie, head cheese). \u00a0And fortunately, St John is about much more than eating nasties... it's about no-frills, fresh, local and seasonal food - think purple sprouting tops, squid and tomatoes, squash soup, lancashire cheese.That said, you really need to love meat to eat at St John. \u00a0You can't quiver if you see them oiling up a suckling pig, fresh from the local butcher. \u00a0Indeed, you should want to eat the pig - but be sure to reserve one (apparently there are only 3 available per night and sadly, I have not had the pleasure). \u00a0If you're with a group for a special occasion (St John is perfect for larger parties) and can't share a pig, indulge in the feasting menu which offers choices of dishes, shared family-style. \u00a0A recent visit yielded their famous and delicious roast bone marrow (served plainly, with parsley, capers, rock salt and toast), a simple block of fois gras, roast beef with horseradish cream, roast chicken with bread sauce (slightly boring) and a decadent, sloppy dessert of Eccles Cake and Chocolate \"Terrine\" (a melded dark chocolate brick) with creme fraiche. \u00a0Yes, we were full. \u00a0Note: \u00a0St John sources its amazing bread from sister restaurant/bakery St John Bread & Wine, another go-to for top-notch food (in a more casual atmosphere).",

THEN to add on top of that, sometime between the time that we were eating dessert and done with our meal, she left or at least disappeared from sight. usually waiters will at least leave the bill or let us know that they will be leaving but nope. she was just gone. so we were left waiting. and had to flag another waiter down to get our bill... very disappointed. now onto the MOST important part the food. was delicious! we ordered: - BONE MARROW - a special tool is provided to scoop out all the goodness inside the bone and add a bit of salt and leaves. BEST thing there. dont add too much salt b/c its strong. - OX TONGUE - surprisingly veryy good as well. definitely try this. - venison offal - not so good. perhaps b/c we just didnt like offal. its internal organs if you dont know.. the sauce was decent though- BRAISED MALLARD (wild duck) - came with meat and wing. the meat was a bit tough but still tasted good. the wing was better. would suggest this. - fronton reser red wine - great. went well with our meat- sprout tops - for just veggies. this was good, although hard to cut - chocolate terrin & milk toffee ice cream with waffle cracker - chocolate was too rich. the ice cream and waffle cracker was delicious!!! three combined tries to balance the richness of the chocolate but is unsuccessful. however it is much tastier if you eat all three in the same bitewas very surprised this restaurant didnt have a tasting menu so we just ordered a la carte and shared. the entrees were just okay to me. the appetizers was definitely the highlight of our meal!! as a top 50 restaurant in the WORLD, i would have expected a bit more. however the food is VERY UNIQUE and definitely worth a try.",

Out of all the English restaurants we've tried in London, this was perhaps the only truly excellent (and one of the few even decent) establishments we visited. Our dishes were the lamb tongue and bone marrow appetizers, along with braised chicken with bacon and mashed potatoes and breaded veal entrees. For dessert, we split a sumptuous apple crisp. Every one was spectacular, particularly the bone marrow. On any subsequent trips to London, I will always make a point to come back to St. John's - it gets points for being a memorable restaurant in London's mostly bleak gastronomic scene.",

This was my friend and my first visit, so we had MANY questions to ask our waiter. He was ever so patient and explained everything we wanted to know in detail. He knew his stuff. We finally decided on the bone marrow salad to start, and for mains, my friend ordered the guinea fowl, and I the lemon sole. The food was exquisite. We both wiped our plates clean. The bone marrow salad, to my surprise, was incredibly delicious -- a bit oily, but delicious, nonetheless. It was served with a few pieces of toasted bread (heaven in itself).

My companion had the onion/bacon soup as a starter and skate as a main with a glass of the Vignobles Guillaume 2008 pinot; I had the octopus starter with a glass of Mas d'Auzieres 2008 rose and mutton main with a glass of Eric Texier 2007 Cote du Rhone. \u00a0The positives: the soup was superbly rich and was characterized as \"liquid bacon\", the skate was succulent (but I have not tried skate before so don't have any benchmarks), and the mutton was very nicely done; tender and with a pleasant amount of gamey funk (but I have never tried mutton before, so etc). The negatives: I felt the octopus was a bit overcooked and its dressing too bright; the main accompaniments (swede with the mutton, and a caper sauce with the skate) tasted nice enough but were otherwise unremarkable. \u00a0The wine pairings were my own choice so I can't levy criticism there. :) We ordered an additional side of cabbage and potatoes which was pleasantly buttery.Water and bussing staff were generally attentive.My primary criticism is with the service; while the host was welcomingand charming, the waitstaff for our table was distracted and distant and our interaction with them was devoid of even the most perfunctory pleasantries. \u00a0Overall, the experience didn't match up to other Michelin-starred restaurants at which I've eaten, but I'd recommend it to others based on the competence of the kitchen and the relatively reasonable price point.",

    "text": "I booked a reservation online before going on Holiday to London a few months back. I was surprised to get a response as quickly as I did. Seeing as how my BF and I are foodies, we had to eat at St John's on our holiday. We knew we picked the right place to eat because a local Briton told us as we were walking towards the door that St John's was one of the best restaurant in England. He was correct. Seeing as how the US dollar had such a low exchange rate, we were tried to budget. Our apps were marrow salad with parsley for the BF, parsnip soup with back fat for myself. \u00a0Both dishes were very unique. We of course shared a little. The marrow came in the bones, fresh out of the oven. A nice little parsley salad with shallots and capers was served on the side, as well as some nice country bread. The one bite I had was very tasty. I only took one bite because I had an issue with the texture of the marrow ( a personal problem lol) He loved it! My soup was nice. the back fat added so much to the soup, it was just amazing to eat them together. My only complaint was the small portion of back fat, about 4 little pieces. The soup was amazing with them, but not my favorite without the fat. I had a braised squirrel for my entree, and the BF had chitterlings with radish ( thats pig stomach for you folks watching at home) \u00a0I hadn't had squirrel before, it was really interesting! I liked it, but it was so gamey I got full pretty fast. I'm not used to such gaminess, it was good but a little much. I tasted a bite of the chitterlings and was glad I didn't get them. They were ok, not really my type of food. We both really loved the vibe of the restaurant. St John's has an incredible menu as we spent a long time deliberating on what to order. Its short and simple, but very creative. They cook simple food, but very out of the ordinary for the American palette. I really liked that. It was really fun to see a menu and have no idea what anything tastes like, it's a great way to develop a palette. Too full and a tad ill, we skipped dessert ( budget too) It was a wonderful experience, a place I would eat at if I happen to be in London again anytime soon.",

Simple cooking methods, fresh ingredients and great food without boundaries and pre-conceptions! I love St John; I can't stress enough about this place! Crispy Pig's Skin & Dandelion is great to start and they do whole roast sucking pig if you order in advance(quite expensive though, \u00a3320 for a whole pig) but it is really good and truly recommended!!! Try it and you will know what I mean! A real feast this one! They do Christmas puddings and mince pies too check it out maybe something for Christmas!",

    "text": "I have come to pay homage to the restaurant that started it all...Admittedly, snout to tail eating isn't really anything new. \u00a0Not from my experience, at least. \u00a0But at St. John, it's the attention they bring to it, and the ethos of preparing food in the simplest way that made the restaurant truly special.I walked in to a stark, austere looking dining room with bare white walls, tables with white butcher paper on top, and no flowers or fancy settings to distract. \u00a0I was expecting to feel cold from all the austerity. \u00a0But instead, I felt warm from the lively atmosphere and the knowledgeable staff. \u00a0To start, a 2007 Mas d'Auzieres 'Sympathie pour les Stones' from Languedoc. \u00a0It was a marvelous GSM blend, with a tres-witty name. \u00a0I found it interesting too that St John decided to go into the wine business, and that the retail price of the wine are listed on the menu. \u00a0For starters, the Roast Bone Marrow with Parsley Salad. \u00a0I have had the bone marrow dish at a number of places elsewhere. \u00a0It was a different feeling eating the dish where it was 'invented'. \u00a0A bit of parsley and a sprinkle of rock salt really brought the richness of the marrow to another level. For mains, Middlewhite and Fennel, and Ox Heart and Chips. \u00a0I'm a big fan of porchetta, and the Middlewhite did not disappoint. \u00a0The skin seemed to have been taken off, deep fried, and then put back together on the dish. \u00a0Brilliant. \u00a0The ox heart was sliced thin, marinated, and grilled quickly. \u00a0It appropriated the texture of very very tender skirt steak. \u00a0The chips were sort of uninspired, but the side of boiled Spring Greens brought enough freshness to counter the pork and beef. \u00a0For pudding, a Nectarine & Raspberry pie. \u00a0Great tangy and sweet fruit compote under a crisp cobbler topping. \u00a0A very unique combination which made me want to attempt it at home.Why 5 stars? \u00a0My dining list in London had so many places that spawned out of St John. \u00a0Here in Chicago, and elsewhere, a slew of restaurants follow the same philosophy. \u00a0Only a handful of restaurants in the world perhaps have this kind of claim.",

Always busy on the weekdays where mostly business people seem to be treating each other, they also have a much less formal dining area out back where you can indulge in the many other wines that they also serve.

    "text": "What. A. Drag. This was a restaurant of legend for us, having first heard about it in Last Supper where the late great Bourdain waxed poetic about St John's bone marrow. This is the place that defined nose to tail cooking. We were ready for it, had barely eaten all day in anticipation of it. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar and were ready for some simple unfussy food well prepared. We started with the bone marrow, pickled herring with creme fraiche, and the crab toast. All decent but nothing particularly mind blowing. The herring was easily the best thing, tangy and tart with a generous dollop of fatty cream to balance it all out. Pretty standard but well executed. The bone marrow was just fine. There was three times as much grilled bread as was necessary for such a meager bit of marrow. \u00a0I had maybe one good bite, again nothing special. \u00a0The crab toast was totally boring. All crab guts, no crab. \u00a0Also, how many starters on toast can a person eat?The mains were where the wheels fell off the train though. We were hoping for more offal, but the menu has gotten boring or at least was the night we were there. We had the tripe with chips and ketchup and ate half of it, it was just a plate of fried crap, more chicken McNuggets than cooking of any quality. The tripe was good but the preparation so greasy and overdone that it was impossible to eat more than a couple pieces. The other dish was the smoked eel with beets and horseradish. Pretty good actually - but again mystifying why they'd pair earthy meat with earthy veg and deep fried meat with deep fried veg, it was all so one note. Ultimately though the thing that pushed the whole meal from just disappointing into kind of a piss off was the service. This is no fancy joint, it's whole aesthetic is working class food, I get it. The prices aren't awful either so nobody is expecting 3 Michelin star service, but honestly I have sat for a shorter amount of time over a pile of dirty dishes or waited for a bill longer at greasy spoon diners than I have at St John. We had planned to order dessert but it took so long to have our dirty dishes cleared and for the waitress (who's first words were \"are you ready to order\" and who hadn't taken a drink order yet and seemed entirely over it from the moment she walked up - honestly lady if you hate your job and all your clientele that much find a new job) to come take our order that we just asked for the bill instead. In the end I had to get up and ask her to pay she was so interested in clearing the \u00a0empty tables rather than serving the ones with warm bodies in them.In one line, we came for \"Nose to tail\" and all we got \u00a0we \"ignored and bailed\".",

Of course our second visit was not an opportunity lost, we had tried other dishes such as the HAM AND PEA SOUP: a bowl or heart of pure and richness.

All were equally excellent in their own way. Simple, tasty, no frills. To top it all off we also bought a bottle of their house Bourgogne. Simple, drinkable, light, just how it's supposed to be. Was the bathroom visit just as sublime as my first? There was no CK One soap, but they did have my favorite: Aesop! St. John this time around easily lived up to its first visit.",

Of course we had dessert which was vanilla ice cream on top of quince jelly/jello. The service was excellent and our server made great recommendations and gave feedback on dishes that fit within our friend's dietary restrictions.

I learned about Fergus from the original Bourdain episode from the era of No Reservations and the first time was amazing. Every time has been amazing. I have made it a point to come back here every time I've been in the city no matter how short of a stay and with as many people as I can. I enjoyed it so much I kept coming back a few nights in a row and just eating solo at the bar because it's just that good. I don't think you can get this type of cooking at this level anywhere else in the world. The menu changes daily, the main courses are seasonal, the wine list is excellent, and the service is typically on point. This place is so good I don't even know how you could debate going here.

We were seated against one corner of the restaurant which was rather spectacular as we could overlook the entire space, and the presentation of staff and dishes were on point. For starters we ordered artichokes and snail soup, fried skate cheeks, and fried lamb brains. The soup was amazingly buttery and full of texture, the cheeks were relatively soft and light in flavour with a not so \u00a0acidic tomato sauce, and the fried brains was remarkably velvety and crispy with a floral egg salad on the side. For the mains we had a hare saddle and brill with chips - the hare was served pink and seared to a caramelised brown on the edges, with a red wine vinaigrette salad on the side it contrasted the heavy flavour of the red meat. The brill was fried to a perfect crisp on the skin and a thick juicy chunk of meat all throughout the slice, with a sharp garlic mayo as accompaniment with the thick-cut chips. For desserts we ordered an Eccles Cake and Lancashire Cheese, which was a perfect combo of sweet and savoury finish to the meal - the cake was bursting festive flavours! Also a Blood Orange Pavlova which I think it was a little heavy handed on the alcohol because the bites even with granola sprinkles tasted slightly bitter without the blood orange.Overall it was a fantastic dining experience and I would love to come back and try more of their finger-licking dishes!",

To be honest, I've had better marrow bones in the states, but this would be a close second. Very good, just different flavors which I think are at a disadvantage compared to some others I've had. My love had the pigeon and trotter special which she enjoyed very much. I had the Hereford and trotter dish which was also delicious. Two things about that though - the crispy pig skin they prepared was basically inedible, and the cut of meat was probably too undercooked for many, but I found it enjoyable. I would make this a required stop when visiting.",

Things were off to a good start. We were then seated at our table in the dining room--a cool, extra-wide table for two, so we didn't feel too smashed in. The place was busy and things were hopping. But it was all sorta downhill from there. The service was really abysmal. No warmth. Which is okay if it's efficient. Which it wasn't. Lots of staring at dirty plates. No one asking whether things were okay. Waiting for the dessert menu. Waiting for the waitress to come back for the dessert order (which we finally decided to skip, so poor was the service). Waiting for the bill as we watched her chatting with the other waiters or clearing other empty tables. And then waiting again for her to return so that we could pay and get the hell outta there (we finally had to physically get up and flag her down). The type of service that drives a diner nuts, really. The food: bone marrow was fine--tasted like bone marrow you'd get anywhere...I have not idea why this is considered a signature dish. The herring was great. The eel was also good. The deep fried tripe was truly awful. Final note: the lavatories were filthy. Water and bits of soggy paper on the floor, grimy tile, dirty doors...plain old gross. Details, guys, details. You can do better than this.",

    "text": "If you're curious about offal and true british food, come here first. However, if you're looking for a Michelin experience, try someplace else.Pig Spleen wrapped in bacon. Now, I hadn't had pig spleen before this, but slate grey liver-like coils of spleen, and thick tender fat, cut with reduced vinegar, cornichon and onion? Yes I will savor 3-4 tiny bites of that please.Pig ear salad had a wonderful secret darkness to it. Five spice? Just the nature of pig skin? hard to say, but marvelously cut with cucumbers and parsley.Faggots were my least favorite of the dishes. The waiter was being both patronizing and irresponsible when he said \"they're like meatballs.\" When a ball of meat is made with lamb liver and pork fat, the likeness is fleeting. I liked the offal-rich flavor, but they were very heavy and dense. While the braised onions and firm lentils went well as a homey stew, none of the dish was elevating.The Bath Chaps are my recommended order. First, think of pork belly. Where sometimes the meat layers in pork belly are a little stringy or tough or crunchy (it's bacon, after all), make that meat meltingly, braisedly tender. Now the fat. Crisp the fat gently, just on the edges, like the brown tip of fat on the edge of a nicely seared steak. That is bath chaps. Put that next to a fresh dandelion salad, not bitter or stringy but young and springy, in a dressing celebrating English mustard and olive oil.For dessert, we had the cherry and custard tart. The texture was amazing - crust was replaced with the thinnest layer of cake, and the top was toasted. The custard was sweet and smooth. The problem was that the cooked cherries were so tart and the custard so sweet, that even mixing the two in my mouth didn't create balance. The few cherries I had that were ripe tasted bland, so it didn't seem like they were purposefully going for a tart and sweet thing or a sweet and sweet thing; it seemed like they hadn't checked their produce. Oh, and for 8.50 a slice, you can buy a cherry pitter and a stage to operate it.But here's the thing. I don't generally change ratings based on service, but this place has a Michelin star. It's not just that the waiter was careless. It was the paper tablecloths, the same metal breadbaskets as the neighborhood curry house. Heavy short wineglasses and mediocre, metallic St John's branded wines to go in them. The bread? Not great. Sort of a normal country loaf with a too-soft crust, and I found the brown one too sweet. I know Michelin isn't supposed to be about service, but some of these features actively detracted from the food.",

My hubby is a big fan, and since we were going to be in London for a few days on our way to Scotland, I promptly made a reservation. We really enjoyed this place. For how famous it seems to be it was not at all pretentious; the d\u00e9cor is simple and clean. I could imagine living in the neighborhood and having dinner here frequently (a girl can dream!). My husband was very much hoping to try the bone marrow, so we were a little bummed that it wasn't on the menu that day. Note, this is a \"Nose to Tail\" place, which basically means utilizing all parts of the animal, so you may encounter some very interesting and unique dishes. We both went with meat heavy plates: Corned beef for me, which came with spinach. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The presentation is not fancy; it is all about the food at this place. This is the first (and only) Michelin-starred restaurant that I have been to. It did not disappoint. And we didn't feel as if we spent a fortune to eat there, which was surprising, because we also had wine and dessert! Will definitely become a regular haunt the moment we are able to purchase ourselves a flat in London. Fingers (and tails) crossed!",

However, it all comes across as more focused on the food and just having a good time with your companions. The pork terrine was excellent as a starter.

    "text": "St John is a restaurant that has a very clear idea of who it is. This allows it to make some bold choices about how it presents itself. I find that interesting because although there are plenty of places to buy good food in London, the words 'fine dining' usually demand a certain sheen to the proceedings. A sheen that can occasionally be used to distract attention from, say, mediocre food. St John's very sparseness means that the food and the service have nowhere to hide. You can't be sidelined by the acres of challenging art on the walls - because there isn't any - and the only concession to design is an almost unbroken line of coatpegs running around the walls at just above head height. It reminds me a little of a classroom in a minor public school. This is not, contrary to what you may think, a bad thing, partly because the confection of scent that that conjurs up in my head \u00a0a faint whiff of old cabbage and gym socks \u00a0fails to materialise and you're left with the perfume of really good cooking. When I say that there's no sheen to St John, I don't want you to think that it isn't slick. Front of house is friendly and brutally efficient, as was our waitress. Perhaps too efficient, almost: I don't doubt that she's answered questions about the specifics of the menu more times than I've eaten er pigs chitterlings, but that's no excuse for blitzing through it like Lewis Hamilton through a crash barrier. The menu, in case you're wondering, is as sparse as the decor. There's no attempt to explain the ins and outs of the aforementioned chitterlings, or indeed the Ox Heart with Chips, or any of the other oddball concoctions. As I'd imagine most of the clientele will feel faintly apprehensive about precisely what they're getting, explanation would seem to me to be absolutely de rigeur. I started gently, with brown shrimp and white cabbage in a herby, cr\u00e8me fraiche-y sort of dressing. It was lovely without being spectacular: a refreshing, almost palate-cleansing intro. My partner charged straight in with sliced saddle of venison accompanied by a celeriac and horseradish splurge. The venison was absolutely thrilling: sweet, soft, rich and compelling. Almost the high point of the meal. Almost. My partner's main was a couple of slabs of Gloucester Old Spot pork, smoked and pot roasted with marrow and potatoes. Lovely, but almost too easy for a place like this. Let's be honest, roast pork is great but it's not a culinary journey into the unknown. Which made me terribly glad that I'd chosen ox heart. Sliced into thin strips and pan fried, with excellent crispy chips in attendance, it was a dark and dangerous plateful of meaty joy. I really, really cannot recommend it highly enough. The wine list veered into the overly expensive, but there were plenty of reasonably bottles for under \u00a335 and a youngish burgundy served to wash all this goodness down. After the mains, desserts were almost comic in their simplicity. My strawberry sorbet with a shot of ice-cold vodka freshened me up nicely, while figs in honey with a cr\u00e8me fraiche accompaniment was lovely and comforting but very rich after all that meat. St John is probably not for everyone, although the packed dining room on Friday night seemed to say otherwise. It's also not cheap, with dinner for two (including a \u00a335 bottle of wine) coming in at over \u00a3100 with tip. Still, it's an experience you'll find in few other places. My advice is to go, bury any misgivings you have, and choose something you're really not too sure about. If you like meat, I give you a 90% chance you'll love what you're given.",

I had just arrived earlier that day from Paris where I ate extremely well, so my expectations were quite high. I got the black squid ink appetizer and the grilled pigeon as a main. The squid was good - it was served room temperature and the portion was quite large, and had pickled onions that complemented the squid, but I've had squid + ink served better and more creatively elsewhere. The pigeon was poor - I ordered it pink but it was still too dense and done for my taste. Also, I felt like the preparation was too simple - it didn't taste like anything; I'm not even sure if they bothered to salt and pepper it before grilling, and it didn't taste of being grilled. The skin was not crispy, I didn't see any value in its preparation. The service was quite good though (very attentive and polite), especially on a Friday night. The location and space is pretty neat, though the setup is a bit confusing with the tables out front and in the atrium, but the actual restaurant up the stairs from the bar.",

Our favorite was probably the Welsh rarebit -- we had no idea what it was coming in, but we were sold when we found out it was essentially like a cheesy bread / grilled cheese, and this was among the best versions of that I can remember eating. The bone marrow was also great, in exactly the way you'd expect. We enjoyed the tamworth and the lentils that came with it as well, but I didn't think it was overly memorable. Same for the beetroot.The madeleines are much-hypes, and deservedly so. We liked all three desserts, but this was the obvious standout.Overall, really solid food, and a good excuse for us to branch out a bit.

Completing our holiday in Europe, it was one of our last meals and we both decided that this was meal was fantastic and the service was so good. Atmosphere was great. I liked the simplicity and how it matched the whole building with the bar and entry, etc. Our waitress was on-point. She was super helpful, communicative, had good recommendations, and read us so well in the sense that she wasn't hovering over us or rushing us or not existent. Ha, overall just great service. That being said, the food, oh man, it was so good. Being a nose to tail restaurant we weren't s quite sure what to expect but we knew that the bone marrow was a must as it is a dish that is always on the menu even while other dishes change. Our menu choices: Mussels and White Cabbage SaladCrispy Pig Skin and DandelionRoast Bone Marrow and Parsley SaladRoast Middle White, Fennel, and Trotter Green SaladStrawberry Eton MessSuch a scrumptious meal for sure. Their specials sounded really good too. While it was our first time in London, it seemed like it may be homey British comfort food. While the ingredients seemed simple, the depth and flavor was so good and went so well together. The ingredients were very fresh as well. The two salads that we had (mussels and crispy pig skin), were really great choices for us. The mussels were I believe the best mussels I've ever had and the crispy pig skin was so fresh and stayed crunchy while eating the meal and complemented the dandelion well. Roast Bone Marrow, oh soo good! \u00a0Complete the bite with the marrow, a bit of parsley and onion, and salt, yum! Roast Middle White, Fennel and Trotter, comfort food and flavorful.Green salad: simple flavors but fresh and pallatte cleansing between the dishes, bigger than we expected but went well with our meal.Strawberry Eton Mess: yummy strawberries with cream, meringue, puree, etc. Not overly sweet and the strawberries and meringue chunks were pleasant. Went well with our espressos! We wanted to try many things but of course couldn't order everything. We will have to return another time... :P Tip: Make reservationsTip2: You have to walk through the bar before you get to the dining room which is on your right up a few stairsTip3: No phone signage as courtesy which was great so you don't get people on their screens the whole meal and instagramming or facebooking everything. That being said, I did have my actual camera and did take pictures of the food. \u00a0Tip4: Wine recommendations were great!",

I wanted to try a different type of British cuisine and saw this restaurant kept popping up in all the lists but it just wasn't for us. Food was very very rich and hard for my stomach to process during and after the meal. Menu changes daily so also hard to plan ahead but we had the bone marrow (3/5), cod appetizer (4/5 - the best part was the lentils), cured beef with horseradish (5/5) and kidneys on toast (1/5 - just not for us and too much of it). Wine list was average. Service was friendly. Just wasn't for us",

For my main course I had smoked Scottish haddock in a heavy cream sauce with garlicky mashed potatoes. \u00a0Definitely very heavy and one has to be very adept to remove bones along the course of the meal but the efforts pay off. \u00a0There was a definite smokiness to the fish that was scooped up by the creaminess of the heavy cream. \u00a0Both smoky and creamy flavors emboldened the modest mashed potatoes and made it part of the team instead of an entity on the side lines. \u00a0My only regret, besides the presentation, was that over time, the flavors that were once so daring became muted and almost one-noted towards the end of the meal.The fresh mint tea I had to cap off the meal steeped for about 10 minutes but was still very light.I definitely recommend to go to this establishment if you are feeling adventuresome and have the time to delve into interesting taste profiles.",

    "text": "We went here because we wanted to try bone marrow, and after it came up in a search, we realized their bone marrow dish was Anthony Bourdain's death row meal. So, that was a clincher. You need a reservation. But we made ours the day before, we checked on Thursday for a Friday time and it was easy on OpenTable! They will hold a card and charge if you cancel. The restaurant is inside (not in the garage/foyer), near the bar inside (well lit), but up the stairs to the right. It took us a few minutes to figure out where we were supposed to go. St. John has 5 \"No\" policies. No music, no art, no garnishes, no service tax and no flowers. I personally loved this, though I couldn't put my finger on what I liked until after our meal. The walls are a soft buttery white, coat hooks adorn the room above all perimeter tables and the table scape is white. The sound is conversation and kitchen noises. It felt like you were in a large living room, because there wasn't any piped in classical music or smooth jazz. Our waiter was so great, and I'm thankful we had someone to guide us through the process of this place. We knew we wanted the marrow salad. He recommended a nice red wine for me to go with the marrow, it was a chianti of some kind. He didn't hover or check in too much, it was a subtle art of service and he had it nailed. He asked if we wanted anything besides the marrow to start, and we asked if the marrow was pretty filling. He said it was. After our salad arrived, he gave us a crash course in how to use the lobster pick and the sage advice, \"Don't be afraid to get messy!\" Thank God I know Cole pretty well already, because we got messy. As he cleared away our plates, we honestly thought of canceling our mains, because the marrow was so filling. We came really close to flagging him down and saying we'd just do appetizers and dessert. But we let the mains come.We both had the middle white (a special kind of pig) with parsnips and a mustard gravy sauce. I never knew I liked parsnips. I don't usually eat pork, but honestly, this was the meltiest, most perfect pork I've had in my life. I didn't think anything could be better than the marrow on toast but the pork should really be considered! I am so so so glad we didn't cancel them. When we return, we'd probably split a marrow salad. They serve it with 3 large bones. However, the dinner portions weren't so large as to be overwhelming. In fact, we left room for dessert. Letting the waiter guide us through the dessert options was fun, and we ended up settling on the cherry trifle. It was a chocolate pudding layered with cherries and topped with whipped cream. Def too large to have alone but perfect to share. The perfect cap to a perfect meal! The meal took about 90 mins, so allow ample time to savor. We left satisfied and happy but not stuffed to the gills.",

Made dinner reservations for this place 3 weeks before traveling to London.They change their menu often, but one constant is the BONE MARROW. We ordered a few dishes, but we probably could have done without them and ordered only the bone marrow. Omg it was so good.. so rich and packed with umami flavor. We ended with fresh Madeleine cookies that were amazing as well. There's a bar attached to the restaurant where you can order food (including the bone marrow). If you're a small party (2 to maybe 4 people) and you don't have a res, it's worth trying to snag bar seats and ordering there. In fact, if I am lucky enough to ever come back, I'll prob opt to eat at the bar area instead.",

Even after all the hype, the restaurant's signature dish did not disappoint. Every bite is an explosion of well-balanced flavors and textures: the fattiness of the marrow, the crunch of the bread, the acidity of the salad. I'd also recommend trying the Welsh rarebit, but only if you are into intense cheeses. It has a strong flavor profile and is more of an acquired taste.",

It's divine. Veal marrowbones, served with grilled day old sourdough bread made at their bakery, and a parsley salad made with parsley, shallots, and capers dressed with olive oil and lemon juice and seasoned with sea salt and pepper. It's served with coarse, \"wet\" grey sea salt to dress the marrow with. I like to dive into the marrow with the lobster pick provided, slather it over the bread, sprinkle with sea salt, and top with the parsley salad. Savor every bite. This is definitely shareable, but we usually don't :-) Always hear out the daily specials, as they are usually worth trying. The only thing we tend to order off the menu is the bone marrow. Service: Efficient, knowledgeable staff, that are reasonably attentive. Cost: Two bone marrows, two mains, one green, two glasses of wine, and one desert ran about \u00a3106. Quite worth the money. Overall: Do make a reservation. It's almost impossible to be seated otherwise. There are other St. John restaurants, but this is the only one with the one marrow I believe, so keep that in mind when making a booking.",

    "text": "For most of the world outside of London, St. John and its Chef Fergus Henderson probably burst into our collective consciousness when some guy called Tony Bourdain (on the London episode of his first show, A Cook's Tour) engaged with Chef Fergus Henderson on what may have been the first US televised treatise on \"Nose to Tail Eating\" (also the title of Fergus' groundbreaking cookbook). It captured one of the earliest moments of this era in which food has attained elevated cultural stature alongside art, music, and theater. Almost two decades later - where almost all restaurant cooking associates itself with \u00a0some form of regional cuisine, and the provenance of ingredients can almost be presumed - how does St. John remain relevant? \u00a0This place just has a knack for preparations that never try to do too much with the ingredient, while ensuring that you'd have no regrets if it were to be done this way forever.Starters involved: mandoline-sliced Kohlrabi (cabbage bred with an over-emphasis on its stubby root) dressed lightly in lemon and oil, with tiny capers and even tinier leaves of parsley. A plate of Smoked Sprats (a kissing cousin of sardines, herring and anchovy) that, if you closed your eyes, has that same smoky tang of a frankfurter hot dog. \u00a0We also couldn't resist the prospect of a plate of cold roast mutton/chicory/anchovy spotted on the Bar menu on the way in. \u00a0It turned out to be a re-imagination of a Caesar salad - leaves of endive, sliced shallots, and roast mutton (not gamey at all) tossed in an anchovy dressing that makes no apologies for containing anchovy.Next course in, crusty (previously crispy) lamb sweetbreads are enveloped in a stew of spring - a juxtaposition of lush spring peas and long cooking with salted pork (and an exemplary specimen of that timeless technique of smothering the crispy/crusty in a dense sauce, while somehow coming out with a net positive). The garnish of raw pea sprouts may have been a bit superfluous, but one must nonetheless appreciate the conceptual flourish in this English rendition of alla Primavera.A vegetarian main of Artichokes, Broad Beans (Favas) and Goat Curd - a runner-up as dish most redolent of springtime \u00a0during this meal- served as a hefty side.Pigeon roasted medium rare -two halves taken off the bone- without even a hint of the livery-ness typical of this domesticated gamebird. \u00a0While lamenting a lack of sauce and a very slight dryness from this well hung bird, I'm certain we committed some sort of taboo by reaching for the salt and pepper grinders. \u00a0We were more than halfway through before we realized the half of an endive caramelized in butter on the side must have been intended to contribute the requisite lubrication and condiment.As we tucked into our aforementioned mains, the regret of not ordering the Hake haunted us (a rare treat for those from outside of the North Atlantic, the unofficial national fish of Spain). So we put in an extra order, a bone-in tranche cut close to the fish's tail. Lightly starched and crisped, it was as if this fish campaigning for itself as the superior alternative to Cod and Haddock for frying. \u00a0 The purple sprouting broccoli -dressed in a mayonnaise-ey concoction involving sliced shallots and capers and some red spicing (paprika?)- does the work you might expect from a tartare sauce. For the denouement, we opted for after-dinner savouries instead of sweets. \u00a0An all British cheese plate notable for its deliciousness (I presume by now you're as tired of my descriptions as my palate was tired by the end of the meal- so please just refer to pics).I would also be remiss if I did not give a mention to the wines. \u00a0The list leaning heavily towards Southern France, offers a number of St. John's proprietary bottlings, including those from their own Boulevard Napoleon winery in Minervois. \u00a0We tried a few of these available by the glass, all are straightforward wines that pair well with the rustic and flavorful food, while never becoming a distraction. P.S.For those of lamenting the lack of photos, I apologize for this negligence (with the exception of one snap of the cheese course). \u00a0My wife -who is usually responsible for capturing such moments in a visual medium- was very much occupied: \u00a0the 2 of us were busy gorging ourselves on this meal which, according to the menu, should feed 4.",

We did not quite check off the box next to each & every item, but I think I filled in my organ meat quota for the next year, or ten years.Service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting while not too loud to have conversations.

The service here was super nice and the smell of the restaurant just screams fresh and delicious.My boyfriend and I tried an assortment of dishes. We started off with the crispy pig cheek, sliced venison and bone marrow. The crispy pig cheek was super crispy and paired wonderfully with dandelion. The venison was moist. The bone marrow was out of this world. I think what made this spectacular for me was just every component this dish came with that further contributed to the flavors of bone marrow. Well-toasted bread with big grains of salt and acidic parsley salad combined with the fatty bone marrow was mind-blowing. So good. A must try.As for the entrees, we decided to be a little more adventurous and tried the grouse. A full small bird that tasted like nothing I have ever eaten before. The texture reminded me of duck but the taste was unique. I honestly cannot fully describe it. The wings were very bitter and the breast was very juicy, also somewhat bloody. It also came with toast spread with grouse pate. That I very much enjoyed. Overall, it was very interesting. I don't think I would personally order it again but it was definitely an experience. We also got the hare which was nice and simple. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly to medium rare.We ended it with their bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and 6 freshly baked madeleines. The perfect end to a very enjoyable meal. The madeleines came fresh out of the oven, super warm and just absolutely amazing. Slightly crisp on the inside, soft yet spongey and moist on the inside. I would go back just to order a dozen more madeleines.",

My husband, sister and brother in law were able to snag a reservation during our stay in London and boy were we thankful. The decor was refined, the servers were friendly and enthusiastic, the food was delicious. The bone marrow accompanied by the scrumptious parsley salad and toast were perfection, but every other dish was equally as memorable. I had the sea bass as my main course and the skin was crispy, but the meat was flaky and flavorful. Overall, our experience was amazing and I will definitely return on my next visit.",

They had not.A glass of the St. John 1er cru blanc de blancs at the bar before was excellent. I am usually weary of branded house wines, but the champagne was exceptional. So exceptional that we ordered a bottle of the St John Burgundy (Pinot Noir) with dinner, and were equally pleased. The meal was everything I imagined. Bone marrow is bone marrow, the only thing you can do to muck it up is try to get fancy, which they do not at St John. Toast, salt, parsley salad. Brown shrimp and cabbage was excellent. Asparagus with hot butter was surprisingly exciting considering its simplicity. Crispy pigs ears were one of the greatest dishes I have ever eaten. Crispy, fatty, meaty, balanced by being mixed in a salad of greens and radishes with \u00a0alight vinaigrette. Sea bass was perfect. The dish was made by the green sauce.I wish I could have the rarebit every time I drink a little too much. The date cake dessert put us over the top.It was the meal of a lifetime, and we will be flying back from New York again just to eat here. It turned out to be everything everyone ever said it was, and then some.",

We enjoyed a delicious cheese plat,e langoustines and some wine and then moved into the main dining room when a table became available. \u00a0I was really hoping for a meat dish--there was no beef or lamb on the menu that night. \u00a0There was pork loin with parsnips which the boy thoroughly enjoyed and I was not at all disappointed with my snails, sausage and chickpea dish. \u00a0YUMMERS! \u00a0Service was a bit disappointing and I was a bit disappointed in the menu. \u00a0I also hoped it would have something \"up\" on St. John's Bread and Wine. \u00a0I think they are pretty much interchangeable. \u00a0All I can say is that you are bound to have a good and unique meal here.",

    "text": "Finally!From the moment I learned that Yelp was planning to launch a UK wing, St. John has been at the top of my list of places to visit. Nose to tail is the pitch they present and as a fan of odd and interesting parts of animals and being a devout follower of the Bourdain school of yumminess, how could I not come here?Last night was finally the night. We arrived quite early in the evening and were actually the first ones in the dining room. That's fine with me, I wasn't there for the people, the scene or anything besides the much rumored and foodie adored, Bone Marrow dish. It was the first time I've ever had Marrow de Bone and wow, is there really anything better than smearing fat on toast and then adorning it with thin little slices of red onion and parsley and wet salt. Ummm, no. No there is not.We also ordered the cheese plate and it was divine. Definitely a well plated plate for the pound. (Try saying that 3 times in a row drunk). When it came to picking a main I was at a total loss. Most of the things I had never even heard of. Faggots and Mash, whoa there, you'll get your ass kicked for saying that in the States! Brill, hmm, what is this Brill you speak of? Oh it's fish. But what about this Ox Heart. Ohhhh, the Ox Heart!Our server raved about it, touting it as the best dish and her personal fave on the menu and with a sell like that, how could I go wrong. When it arrived it was beautifully presented and I was ready to dive right in... The first bite: Hmmm, wow, this texture is really different.The second bite: Wow, this is almost kinda spongy or bouncyThe third bite: Steph who friggin uses the terms spongy or bouncy to describe a dish.The fourth bite: Yep, definitely bouncy and definitely deelish.By the end, this was a killer dish and definitely worth going back for! I should also mention that the wine our server recommended was perfect and in a world full of up sells on the menus and servers not really knowing up from down, it was a true joy to come to a place where everything she said was true. Love it.St. John is definitely worth a visit if you are one who doesn't shy away from things out of the norm. It's how I live my life, so I guess that explains the 5 stars :)",

The space was a jigsaw of rooms, each with a rustic feel, as if we had stumbled into a hidden gem. Unfortunately, we found the meal rather underwhelming.Maybe we were just too exhausted from the red-eye, maybe we weren't ordering the right dishes, or maybe, thanks to Fergus Henderson's revolutionary and widespread influence, others have imitated and eclipsed him. We started with the famous roasted marrow and parsley salad--these were quite tasty and indulgent. But, even marrow is a familiar and often well-executed dish on many a menu these days. For mains, we had smoked haddock and pigeon and carrots. The smoked haddock had a nice, smokey flavor but was a little salty., The pigeon was tender but not very exciting. And, definitely not what I had imagined traveling 5,000 miles for. I think we erred in not ordering sweetbreads and other offal. We were looking for a culinary adventure, and we should have ordered one!",

The bone marrow was delightfully mellow and buttery and literally melted onto the bread. The waiter was excellent and showed us the proper way to prepare the bread and marrow with a spoonful of rock salt. We were left with our tiny fork things digging at the bones to get the last bit out at the end, and it was difficult to let the waiter take them away. The sweetbreads (for the uninformed, as I was at the time, these are a selection of glands and bits from an animal, usually lamb or calf) were tender and succulent and had the most amazing sauce that I don't have the food vocabulary to describe. We had red wine with our meal, all the wines are French and it was whatever their house option was, and it didn't break the bank while complementing the meal nicely. Every part of this experience was excellent and unforgettable.",

I'm really liking Sunday lunch here: either in the main restaurant, or in the bar, with a selection of small dishes.Standards include bone marrow salad, game birds, Eccles cakes, Madeleines and trifle. The baking and desserts really do excel. There's always a vegetarian option as well, but vegetarians should be prepared for the sight of a lot of meat, including complete sucking pigs, or half a pig's head.Always ask if anything is running out when you sit down: there's a whiteboard in the kitchen listing items that are running low.",

It was so rich and cheesy, and the bread was absolutely amazing! Paired with a cold pint and a salad, it was an unbeatable early dinner. The ambiance was awesome too--the super-clean, butcher-esque interior is really fun, and really allows you to focus on having a good time with your friends, rather than being distracted by fussy service or decor.Speaking of the bread in the rarebit, if you live in London, don't bother buying bread anywhere else. Seriously, St. John makes the best sourdough I've had anywhere (including SF California, the home of great American sourdough). The granola is also completely decadent, chock full of dried apricots and vanilla beans! Yum! \u00a0If you stop by to buy either of these things, make sure you grab a brownie too. Super chocolatey, super moist--totally worth it (and I don't even like chocolate that much!).",

First thing - the ambiance sucks. \u00a0I usually don't mind what the restaurant looks like but for the rating that this place has received I felt as if I had arrived in a slaughterhouse. \u00a0The tables and chairs are cheap and uncomfortable as was the service. \u00a0When we inquired to a the preparation of a dish we were meet with an arrogance. \u00a0I apologize that I have never had spleen before. \u00a0We order the following dishes based on the tired recommendations of our server.Starter #1 - Roast Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad - The dish arrived with three bones that were extremely hot to the touch and packed to the top with marrow, bread and the parsley salad. \u00a0Now, i am fan of marrow in small portions. \u00a0It, like foie gras, really is nothing more than very rich and delectable fat. \u00a0So it usually requires something to cut through the grease and elevate the wonderful flavor. \u00a0Enter the parsley salad and then watch it jump up and down and destroy any semblance of flavor the marrow might have had. \u00a0If this was a boxing match, the marrow would have run out of the ring the second the fight started. \u00a0The parsley salad was comprised of parsley(surprise!) capers, sliced onion and a vinaigrette of some sort. When you combine the flavors of the salad, the marrow and the bread together the only thing you can taste is the salad. \u00a0Very disappointing! \u00a0For all the praise this dish had received I was sorely let down.Starter #2 - Rolled Pigs Spleen with herbs and bacon - This was this the dish we were looking forward to. \u00a0The plate arrived with a small bowl filled with a red vinaigrette and pile of sliced onion next to the 4 or 5 slices of spleen. \u00a0When the elements of the dish were combined the spleen was incredibly mild and almost undetectable. \u00a0If you were to leave on item, say the onion, out the spleen became very potent and almost inedible. \u00a0I will restate that I am a fan of offal and order when I can but this was practically eye watering. \u00a0Interesting but definitely not great.Main #1 - Lemon Sole with Tartar sauce - this dish a whole lemon sole served with half a lemon and a ramekin of home made tartar sauce. \u00a0Mediocre at best. \u00a0Not only did the fish taste slightly off but I it was not de-boned nor was an offer of de-boning available. \u00a0I am okay with that if I am provided with the correct utensils \u00a0to do it myself which of course were not provided or were even available, at least that was what I was told. \u00a0Very poor for a restaurant with this rating and reputation.Main #2 - Wood Pigeon - Nothing special at all. \u00a0I believe it was roasted had a lovely flavor \u00a0but nothing to remarkable about it at all.Recap - Went in with hopes and dreams and left feeling like a Lib Dem supporter from last year. \u00a0I just cannot believe that this is ranked in the top 20 restaurants in the world. \u00a0Or that this has somehow managed to achieve 2 Michelin stars. \u00a0The food was mediocre the service was poor and the ambiance sucks. \u00a0The plus side is that the bread was fantastic. \u00a0I will give them that. \u00a0And only that.",

A MUST VISIT place for the culinarily curious, but if your diet predominantly is burgers, pizza and pasta....you may not like it. We had bone marrow, duck hearts, a kind of squid dish and (for good measure) a welsh rarebit (some kind of ham & cheese toasty for the non-british). All tremendously delicious!",

    "text": "St John's is one of my favourite restaurant's in London. The classy white exterior is continued inside with very minimalist wooden furniture and a stainless steel bar. Somehow though, this doesn't feel at all cold or uncomfortable, it's just perfect. The menu at St John's won't suit everyone and if you are at all squeamish about odd cuts of meat or unusual ingredients then may I suggest you keep your distance. This is also not the sort of place where a bowl of chips arrives on the side of every plate as the tried and tested vegetable option. St John's tries to be as seasonal as possible, selecting the very best produce and messing about with it as little as possible. A bowl of purple sprouting broccoli arrives exactly as it sounds, maybe with a knob of butter on top if the chef is feeling especially extravagant. On my last visit my boyfriend and I shared one of the best starters I've ever had. A bowl brimming with langoustine arrived with only bread and mayonnaise as it's accompaniments. Perfect. Simple. Delicious. Only a restaurant so confident in the strength of its ingredients do you get this kind of cooking. A must try!",

I was so glad we tried it. We were seated upstairs and by the time we got there, it was fairly early and people did not show up until much later. The place filled up pretty quickly for lunch and it got a little busy and noisy. The crowd were mostly men in business attire and we were pretty much the only ones in casual wear. Since we were on a time crunch, we decided to do a short and quick meal with just starters. We ordered the bone marrow with sea salt and the crispy pig cheeks with dandelion fronds tossed with a mustard vinaigrette. Reluctant as first, I hesitated to take my first bite of cheek but the rest was history after I did. This is the place where my fondness for pig cheeks were confirmed. Absolutely, incredibly delicious. Crispy, fatty, tender with a hint of smokiness, the meat was really good. The dandelions with the vinaigrette complimented the dish very well. Nicely executed. For dessert, we bought half a dozen Madeleines to take with us for the train ride and they were oh so good. Fluffy, buttery and tasty!I would have to say that although our time there was brief, it was a nice ending to our time in London. I would def come back.",

The bar is done in a down-home style with the kitchen and bar open on two sides. The centre has about half a dozen rustic tables. The set up is intended to create an informal feeling, which if it weren't busy it would. I got there late and two parties were dominating the space which were dominating the space which left me and my date very little choice but to wedge in where we could, which left me feeling as though I had crashed a dinner party uninvited. The bar is well-stocked with a handful of beers on draught and others in bottles, mostly from small brewers. There was also a good range of wines. The bar food fits the rustic mood but is fairly extortionately priced. It is the kind of place which deserves another trip but when I went I found the place too cliquey to be enjoyable.",

I've learned to use pig trotters (pig's feet) to add flavour and body to dishes, I've brined duck legs for days, and it's not only about meat. \u00a0I even prepared Celery Salt and Boiled Eggs. \u00a0But this review is about the restaurant!! \u00a0I only mention the book because many of the dishes from it are on the restaurant menu. \u00a0I know that sounds backwards, but for me, it's great to be able to see how the master has prepared them, and enjoy eating them in the unique atmosphere of his restaurant.I'd highly recommend a meal here. It seems obvious to me that this is an important, landmark restaurant of the food scene today. You can feel the respect the chef has for the food he's served, and the respect for the animal it came from.",

Same thing with the sweetbreads, they were ok but nothing exceptional, the chunks of bacon were too big and overpowering and there was too much liquid. Service on the other side was subpar, very slow, to much waiting time. Also our waitress had a bit of an attitude, she wasn't really paying attention to our table which added waiting time. When after waiting we asked her to come to the table she appeared annoyed. In a nutshell, OK food and subpar service for a place I had high hopes for.",

Although for my liking, a more ambient lighting would be more appropriate.Food. Erm...No. We ordered mutton soup and braised squid for starters; chitterlings and snail with sausage for mains. I was so expecting to dunk crusty bread into my soup...didn't happen. Soup was lacking taste, although mutton was nice and tender. Braised squid with parsnips wasn't particularly special, it was served lukewarm, which was rather a dissappointment. Snails with sausage and chickpeas were good and had a bit of a spicy hit, which I enjoyed. Chitterlings...I had to send it back. The smell was absolutely getting to me and meat (the tiny bit I tasted covering my nose) was taste-less. I ordered haddock instead, which turned out very good and probably was the main highlight of the whole meal.Desserts. Now, this is the reason why i gave it 2 rather than 1 out of 5 stars. Portions of desserts were large enough to be satisfying, but not too large so they would look bulky and 'too much'. We had chocolate terrine and pear and sherry triffle. Yes for both. Terrine was served with an unusual armagnac ice cream, was rich and as my partner expressed it was 'Chocolate heaven'. My pear and sherry triffle was absolutely delicious, but due to vast amounts of bread eaten by me earlier I couldn't finish most of it.Service. The waiter got annoyed with me noticing that squid was lukewarm, and even more so after I send back the chitterlings. He also didn't like the fact that we went out for a cigarette in the middle of the meal, even though we left our bags at the table and didn't look like people who would run away without paying. But he didn't charge us for the fish and rest of the evening he was normal to us. Verdict. I might've said I will come back for the desserts, but no - i'll have it cheaper in any other decent restaurant where I would enjoy the food as well.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been a foodie and chef favorite for a while and always comes highly recommended. I admit I have wanted to go for ages but always held off because it is renowned for a more meat and innards type cuisine which I like, but not always in the mood for. I fancy myself as trying different foods, but sometimes being so adventurous to try the the 'whole' animal I feared I would be disappointed. Not to mention feel like I would have no idea as to what to order. Thankfully my fears were ill founded as the menu while a bit different is really quite accessible and enjoyable. Located in the trendy and happening area of Farringdon (is there anything fabulous these days that is not coming out of this Borough?), the highly touted restaurant is not pretentious in decor or menu. There are two areas for dinning, the bar area, which is an order at the bar and sit setting, or the 'formal' restaurant which is not formal at all though functionally classic with white tablecloth tables in a simple, almost cold feeling, loft style room with the kitchen in the corner.This is not a vegetarian's restaurant for sure, or a place to take picky eaters. St. John take pride in using the 'nose to the tail' of the animal, so items such as tripe salad, one of their signature dishes, and pork cheek, can make even a full fledged meat lover question what to order. I know I wouldn't eat everything on the menu and my taste was limited to one or two items in each category. I started with the roasted artichoke which was soft, tasty and melted on the tongue. That was followed with the calf's liver, which the best way for me to describe it was like a thinner version of foie gras -which by the way, I love. So, I knew what I was in for and it went beyond my expectations. Tender and savory with roast shallots \u00a0which added and almost chutney seasoning and flavoring to the dish. Somehow I had room for dessert which was a gorgeous pavlova of meringue and strawberries. Many of the desserts were fruit based which lends a fresh pallet cleanser and lighter follow up to the heavy main meal. The wine list was impressive with a quality selection of wines by the glass which is always hard to find. Service was efficient and professional.I don't know if I would call this British cooking, but it was a sort of sophisticated farmers cooking -perhaps? It is hard to categorize, so it is something one should go into with eyes open. I don't know if I would take a mixed group there, but save it more for friends who are food buffs and want something out of the ordinary. What I do know for sure is it was one of the best meals I have had and would go back again. And again.",

The razor clams, cooked with a light olive oil, were refreshingly delicious. \u00a0Since the ox heart was on the menu, we had to order it. \u00a0It tasted beefy and quite good. \u00a0The Plaice (a mild white fish) reminded my friend of her favorite childhood dish. \u00a0The fish was cooked perfectly and delicious with the sauteed leeks. \u00a0We all shared the Eccles cake with a wedge of cheddar. \u00a0I've never wanted to try mince meat but when in Rome... \u00a0Mincemeat as it turns out is a mixture of dried fruit and nuts and quite tasty.",

    "text": "Okay there is something about eating the inners of an animal that intrigues and disgusts me all in the same moment. The menu at St John is terrifying, seriously scary and if I had to choose one word, arrogant.Who says this is traditional British food? I don't remember my mum cooking this, or eating this around friends houses. It's like they've take a menu from 1956 and are still making it today. So here is my gripe, I understand that this is a meat eaters paradise but the selection was shocking and disappointing. So if I want fish, there will only be one type, and if I want veggies, yep only one of these two. But if I want tripe, bacon or pigs stomach I have a list full. I tried it, I really did, I had tripe, bacon and peas in a clear broth thingy but really it just tasted bland and slimy. Now you can't knock the service, or the wine, or the desserts. Actually this place is only a 2 star for me, it was the desserts that saved the day. Eton's mess, cheese, proper old school puddings. My eyes were popping at the idea of these delights, and when they arrived they were every bit as awesome as I though.Maybe it's a meat thing, but this didn't tick my boxes.",

    "text": "-I've enjoyed meals at St. John in the past characterized by good, simple food and competent service though sometimes at aggressive price points.-The most recent experience, a suckling pig feast for 16, was pretty disappointing though. The combination of only adequate food and lousy service was completely at odds with the \u00a370-80 cost per person.-The food (whole crab and lamb tongues to start, suckling pig for main and then cheese and plum pie) was fine although presentation was even more perfunctory than usual (e.g. crabs were barely prepared, no knives/spoons were provided to serve the plum pie).-The service, however, was slow, sloppy and inattentive. Vegetarian dishes were forgotten about, no effort was made to keep the table topped up with wine and water and the staff generally seemed very disengaged.-Most frustrating we were initially told that the leftover suckling pig (several kilos worth!) would be packaged up for us to take away. A waiter later claimed that a plate had been 'smashed over it' and the kitchen couldn't release it. How this could have happened when the pork was served on two plates is unclear.-This waste of a lot of good food (for which we had paid the best part of \u00a3400) is unconscionable, especially for a restaurant that prides itself on nose to tail eating. My follow up email to St. John went unanswered.-St. John is resting on its laurels and I don't plan on returning.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love St John like most people already have but i don't know if it was an off night or what, but my experience was not the innovative palette pleaser I was expecting.Usually, I can't go wrong when I'm going off of Tony Bourdain. He was grunting in satisfaction so many times on the London/Edinburgh episode while at St John that I was glad his show is on Cable TV. Therefore, I had St John high on the list of places I wanted to try while in London and was so eager to try it, that when we mistakenly stumbled into the Bread & Wine version of the restaurant, we almost had our lunch right then and there. However, our reservation was at night (late night at that) and from the get-go things were not unpleasant but definitely not up to the standards I had come to expect from a formerly Michelin rated venue.Service was adequate but yet dreadfully slow it seemed for our table of two. Having to flag down the wait staff and then wait half hour intervals was not at all my definition of a great restaurant. I think the waiting contributed to the fact that our appettites slowly deteriorated. Appetizers:Bone Marrow with Parsley - Everyone raves about this and it was fatty and very tasty. The best part of the meal by far. Brown Crab Meat on Toast - Not much to see here. Pretty standard and the crab meat wasn't exceptional nor did the flavor stand out.Vegetable Soup - Actually quite good. It was savory and even a tinge of sweet and the texture of the soup and flavors from the mixture of vegetables worked in harmony. The temperature of the dish could have been warmer though.Mains: Beef Roast - This came out lukewarm and unfortunately was way too bland. Not a good sign when the mashed potatoes are the best part of this dish.Overall, I'd say St John was a disappointment but I came in with lofty expectations and I certainly could have been more adventurous in my orders. However, service was still painfully slow and the food I did order should have been prepared better.",

    "text": "Ranked 41st in the 2011 edition of S. Pellegrino's World's 50 Best Restaurants List, St. John is a London restaurant specializing in game and offal dishes prepared in a no-fuss manner and environment. With a rotating menu that features dishes such as Chitterlings and Radishes, Pigeon and Carrots, and Deviled Lamb Kidneys on Toast, the menu is not for the unadventurous or faint-of-heart, but it's just the place if you are looking for simple, well-executed meat and game. As an Anthony Bourdain-approved restaurant, St. John was high up on my list of potential restaurants to dine at while in London, and I managed to snag a 10:00 pm seating for Saturday night. Unfortunately, the late hour meant that some of the menu items were already sold out, but luckily, the much-acclaimed Roast Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad was still available. As this was my first time eating bone marrow, I was not quite sure what to expect. Let me first say that procuring bone marrow from the bones is a ridiculously messy process, and it really does get quite oily. Maybe that's just because I'm a novice at the art of extracting fatty, jelly-like substances from bones, though. Anyway, my hands were sufficiently coated in a thick layer of fat and grease by the time I finished the dish. The bone marrow, which is the consistency of jelly or congealed animal fat, is actually fairly mild in flavor, and it leaves a thick coating of grease all over your lips (and hands) when you've finished eating. Essentially, bone marrow is like mildly-flavored meat fat, so I can't say I was wowed by the flavors of the dish. The rock salt was key in adding some flavor, but I thought that the parsley salad was way too overpowering to complement the bone marrow, so I just ate it between bites of bone marrow to help cut through some of the richness and heaviness of the fat.With the menu that night seeming to be a bit tame with the offal dishes, I went with the Braised Rabbit, Bacon, and White Beans. Definitely not the most adventurous of dishes, the dish was comprised of extremely tender rabbit meat that literally fell right off of the bone. Mixed in with some chunks of bacon and beans in a stew-like dish, it was a hearty and tasty bowl of food, though I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try something like Ox Hearts, which were on the menu the previous night.For dessert, the baked-to-order Madelines were very tempting, but I couldn't see myself finishing a half-dozen of them, so I opted for Harry Potter's favorite dessert - Treacle Tart. Despite being described by the waitress as \"very sweet syrup poured into a pastry crust,\" I was a bit unprepared for just how sweet the tart really was. Although I've never had pecan pie, I'm guessing that Treacle Tart is very similar but just without the pecans to cut through the sweetness. There were hints of fruitiness as well, but the syrupy tart filling is hyperglycemia-inducingly sweet. The crust lacked the flakiness that I prefer from pastry crusts, but it had a nice, almost-burnt taste that I am personally a fan of. An okay dessert, but not something that I'd order again.In summary, my meal at St. John was fine, but I think I probably ordered the wrong dishes and didn't get the dishes that would have left me with the best impression and representation of St. John's cuisine. I'm a bit disappointed, but that's more due to the fact that I had such great expectations coming into the meal. Was it the 41st-best restaurant in the world? I think that's impossible for me to affirm or disagree with, especially after only dining there once. It's safe to say, though, that the food is well-executed and the menu features plenty of interesting choices. How long the fad of head-to-tail eating lasts is anyone's guess, but I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that St. John will stick around long after the trend dissipates.",

    "text": "I have never and may never have a meal quite like the one I had at St. John. Everything about it seemed just... different. From the perspective of food - I had a great many tastes that were new and delicious: be that bone marrow, hearts, or an incredible date and toffee sauce. From the perspective of service: It was entirely unstuffy, but at the same time, we felt that our waiter could anticipate exactly what we wanted from our meal. I had never had a Tasting Menu with Ale before - but it came out perfectly here. In a restaurant defined (in some ways) by pork, we enjoyed a multi-course meal that was entirely pig free.St. John is a Michelin Starred restaurant, but also a working pub - with tables and stools for those to drop by an enjoy a beer or two. After wandering into the Dining Room, our meal contained one great surprise after another. Fresh Sea Urchins, Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad, Smoked Fish, Creamy Haddock with Saffron, Country Fowl with Sweet Potatoes, Madeleines, Toffee and Date Cake, Eccles Cake - everything tasted delicious. Some were rich. Well, most were rich. But the contrast amongst tastes and textures was stark. And all the while we were treating incredibly by servers who clearly care deeply about their food and their restaurant. The highlight? Probably the desserts. Make sure to save room.In a word - St. John was awesome. I will be back.",
