Things I love about Bill's in London:-tasty, reasonably priced food-diverse menu with plenty of choices for vegetarians, omnivores and carnivores alike-friendly servers who allowed our large group of friends to completely take over the big table in the centre of the restaurant and set up shop for 3.5 hours.Things I feel reservations about:-It feels like it's becoming a chain. The interior is just TOO much like the Bill's in Brighton, and in this setting, it feels contrived for some reason. I wish there was something a bit more unique about the inside that distinguished it from the other Bill's.-The location is sort of dreary. It's in a bit of a mall-like establishment just off Long Acre, squeezed between a Jamie's Italian and other chain establishments. This worries me.Still, I have no complaints about the dinner we had at Bill's. It really didn't let me down, and it was a good spot to gather with a big crowd.",

    "text": "A place I discovered a month ago or so when I decided to find a new place in Covent Garden as I was a bit bored of the places I know. So I walked through St Martin's Courtyard and saw a nice casual place right next to Jamie Oliver's restaurant, which was busy as usual. So I decided to go in this place and I loved it from the moment I entered. I probably wasn't objective as I entered I saw the very tall wall on the left, with all the produce displayed delicatessen style and I just fell in love with it. I didn't experience the slow service that the reviews below describe, as I was seated straightaway although they were pretty busy. There was a couple of tables available inside and in the terrace. The glass doors were fully open as it was quite warm so being inside was very pleasant too, so we stayed in and enjoy the place's atmosphere. On that occassion I wasn't really hungry so we shared a mezze board. The food served was really taste and it had all been done in-house, which was noticeable. However, its size was not generous, so it was a good thing that we weren't too hungry that day. I then had a hot choc and a brownie and both were yummy (and I am a choc expert, me ;) I then have been back for a full English breakfast, which was really lovely. I sat outside that day, on one of these gorgeous sunny days we have had recently, and it really is a very enjoyable terrace right next to Picadillly and Covent Garden, as there is not a road in sight and you feel quite away from the hustle and bustle (except for the traffic noise, unfortunately) I have been back another couple of times for a coffee and a cake, and it is definitely a good option for this too to take a break from a shopping trip in Covent Garden. Finally, I went last Saturday night and I was quite hungry this time. I had the chicken, chorizo and butterbean stew, and it was delish! Plus the portion was generous too, which helps :) Oh, and it was good quality chorizo too, which was appreciated. Next time I will go and explore the produce they sell more and will probably buy a couple. I have taken a few different people here and everyone really liked it and found it different and a great option to know of in the Covent Garden area. Oh, the service has been always friendly. Another plus point. If there was one negative thing that I should say is that I find some dishes a bit overpriced, but overall it is ok.",

    "text": "Bill's came on a recommendation from a concierge and it sounded like it was going to keep me away from pub food so I bit. On finding that this was a concept specialty foods market plus restaurant I became a bit hesitant - places like this tend to trade on their cuteness and Bill's looked like no exception. Dried peppers hanging from the ceiling, shelves stocked with the bright labels of Bill's branded chutney, Bill's branded beans, Bill's branded elderflower syrup. \u00a0It all seemed a bit too conscientious about it's own atmosphere. \u00a0But I was too hungry to go anywhere else and too afraid that all that I'd find was a pub with microwaved beef pasties for lunch. The busy restaurant was out of some of the breakfast items by the time I was seated late into Sunday brunch but, the burgers being walked by on wood planks looked good \u00a0and there was a \u00a0nice selection of vegetarian items on the menu. Many items on the have a Mediterranean and Moroccan \u00a0bent to them and I settled on the halloumi and hummus sandwich served with chips (that's fries to Yanks like me). The sandwich didn't disappoint: it is served on a heartier hamburger bun, the halloumi lightly grilled and the sandwich spread with hummus and mild pepper sauce - all very mild.The invitation to 'shop from your table' is a bit weird - I'm not sure that I'd ever want to stock my larder while out to brunch but perhaps this let's the time compressed have an extra glass of prosecco and still get their Sunday grocery shopping done.",

Quality of food is perfectly fine, nothing outstandingly special, but for Covent Garden and the price.. it's a pretty good steal. The teapots are pretty great too - but I know I have a thing for a good teapot. Only two downsides, the staff are a little bit slow and the brunch is only served until 1200 so not somewhere to rock up at with a late afternoon hangover.

Its in the heart of the touristy Covent Garden and yet hard to find (in fact, two of us couldn't even make it here that morning ... having lost their way).Having said that its an unusual, and not so little coffee shop (its spread over two floors). It seems that their major business is selling a number of household food items like jams and juices etc, rather than cooked food. The menu was quite limited ... a few standard variations of eggs and bread and english breakfast, which disappointed me. I usually prefer pancakes or french toast for breakfast.The food was quite good. I got an english breakfast. The sausage was a bit different than usual. I chose to have \"bubble and squeak\" instead of the baked beans. Who knew that fried leftover vegetables could taste so good :)However the service was not the best. It was slow and unresponsive. I didn't want the tomato in my breakfast and requested them to instead give me an extra egg. I have made such requests at several other places and it had never been refused, except for here. Then i asked them not to get me the tomato ... i didn't want to waste it. But they brought me that anyway.On the positive side they make some good fresh juices which you should try if you ever visit. The price is not exorbitant. I imagine it would be a nice place for an early riser tourist.",

Although it's a chain (a small one mind), Bills is one of those rare finds that leaves you completely satisfied, yet craving more the second you've licked your plate clean. It's the crack of the brunch world. Bills is open for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner, but breakfast/brunch is by far the best time to dine. Portions are generous, prices are very reasonable and they don't seem to skimp on anything. The menu has everything from your traditional English fry-up to Eggs Benedict, french toast, fried bubble & Squeak and pastries galore! There's a wealth of choice and all of it looks too good to pass up. Each meal is a classy work of art ready for knife and fork demolition.I've heard rave reviews about their full-English, but I can't ever seem to wrestle myself away from my favorite meal, the veggie breakfast (I'm not even Vegetarian!). Veggies listen up... this is not your usual fair of mushrooms and wilted tomato. Oh no! Bills Vegetarian feast is a mountain of creamy eggs, guacamole, hummus, perfectly sauteed mushrooms, fresh basil leaves and decadent chili sauce all piled high on freshly baked country toast. It's a kaleidoscope of color and flavor in every bite, and to this day, I can honestly say that I haven't had anything quite like it. For \u00a31 more, you can add beans or bubble and squeak to any of the meals mentioned above. If you want to experience the breakfast of dreams, I highly recommend getting the B&S.Bill's is definitely not your local greasy spoon. In the place of dirty lino flooring and wooden paneled walls you get \u00a0rustic, French-country decor and a warm ambiance. Bills is homey, comfy and perfectly designed for a lazy Sunday with your (posh) mates.",

However the new London venue in Covent Garden is a lot better in my opinion.It is a lot smaller so it feels like less of a drafty warehouse but it retains the gimmicky tins of produce like olive oil for all you Bill's fans. The food served is good and the location in a quiet corner of Covent Garden earns it an extra star. All in all a good place to start the day in the West End.",

The food itself was very nice, simple and came out quickly. The staff as ever were lovely and we were given a nice big area to ourselves.

    "text": "So sad... my second experience at Bill's was not so great... \u00a0Work BFF and I decided to take friends here for lunch. \u00a0We had to wait for a table, which was fine, although because it was raining outside, it was difficult for all of us to wait inside without getting in the way of everyone. \u00a0I was a little surprised that at 3 p.m. this place was still buzzing.Our waitress came over and sat down in the fifth chair and she seemed friendly enough. \u00a0We were waiting on one of my friends, but she had told us to go ahead and order. \u00a0So we did and the waitress said she would be back when my friend showed up. \u00a0We had trouble deciding on what to eat, but eventually we ordered: \u00a0Haloumi and Humus, Cod Fish Finger Sandwich, Avocado and Bacon Salad with chicken, and Broad Bean and Pea Risotto. \u00a0Although there was an issue with trying to order the Avocado and Bacon Salad with chicken as the waitress kept saying to Work BFF's sister that she could order the Caesar Salad and add avocado and bacon... however that isn't what she wanted. \u00a0The waitress came back eventually saying, \"I put the order in. \u00a0We'll see what we get.\" \u00a0Our starter showed up about 30 seconds before our mains, but it wasn't a huge deal.My friend showed up, but our waitress never did. \u00a0We ended up waving down another waitress so she could order. \u00a0Our waitress showed up well after she had ordered, however, we decided that we were probably going to want tea/coffee and dessert so asked for the menu, she took off and a few minutes later, she was sitting in the corner eating and texting. \u00a0All of a sudden our table had been abandoned. \u00a0No waitress was reassigned to us, so we were just sitting there trying to get someone's attention, but because we were in the far corner, it was really difficult to do that. \u00a0Eventually we were able to get someone's attention and order two orders of the Mini Cinnamon Donuts, various teas, and a cappuccino. \u00a0Tea came out, cappuccino came out, milk and sugar came out, and I saw the donuts come out... but after the waiter looked around, brought it to another table, went back to talk to another waitress, he went back to the kitchen with them. \u00a0At this time, Work BFF had received a pot of tea, but no cup for her tea. \u00a0Eventually the donuts came back out to our table and Work BFF took the opportunity to ask for a cup. \u00a0The waitress went over to the prep area where there were glasses and condiments, she looked around, then stood there talking with someone. \u00a0We had to ask someone else. \u00a0Another waitress came back (at this point I had lost count of how many waitresses we had asked for help) with the cup, but took the sugar off of the table without asking if Work BFF or anyone else was finished with it, especially since Work BFF had just received her cup. \u00a0Annoyed and potentially starting to boil, Work BFF waved the waitress back over and said, \"Can we have our sugar back?\" \u00a0She went to yet another table, asked them if she could take their sugar, then brought it over to us. \u00a0When we got the bill, we noticed they had charged the discretionary service charge... everyone at the table agreed we were not paying it. \u00a0Now, we are Americans, tipping is part of our culture, and even when we get less than good service, we tend to still leave a little something, but this... this wasn't even worth leaving anything. \u00a0It is a good thing we were not in a hurry, but this was just upsetting because the food was really good. \u00a0Really good! \u00a0The service was shocking, especially after my first visit. \u00a0So we put the exact cash for the cost before the service charge and the waitress came over and told us that we were short. \u00a0We calmly explained that the service charge is optional and we do not have to pay it. \u00a0She walked away still confused, but that was the end of that. \u00a0Really disappointing.",

    "text": "Bill's has a great vibe and is located in the 'hip' new St Martin's Courtyard development in Covent Garden. Despite being ever so slightly off the tourist trail, Bill's has a prime spot right next to the (mentally) popular Jamie's Italian (people were queuing for a table at Jamie's at 5pm on a Sunday evening). If you can't get in at Jamie's, give Bill's a go instead. This is the first Bill's in London, and it's a cafe-cum-grocery-store-cum bar-cum-restaurant type of place. I went here today for hot chocolate and cakes after a \"strenuous\" afternoon of shopping, and felt very much at home, with jars of yummy preserves adorning the walls, cute candles on the stripped wooden tables and gentle soul music wafting around the colourful room. Nice. Service was a perhaps a little laid back for my liking, and it took a while to be seated, even though there were a few tables available. And the hot chocolate, yet again, WASN'T HOT ENOUGH, despite having requested it to be extra hot. Still, it came with a mound of whipped cream and a flake on top, so musn't grumble. But unfortunately I've minused a star for these factors (yeah, I know I could've sent the hot choc back, but - hey - I'm English). The scones were immense and the jam was so tasty that I shamelessly polished it off with my knife. Oops. You can browse through the grocery list on your table, choose what you want, and the servers will do your shopping for you as you eat and package it all up in a lovely paper bag with hessian ribbon etc etc. Perhaps a bit 'rah' for everyday bits and bobs, but would make a nice present for someone I guess. When I got home an hour or so after leaving Bill's I had chocolate brownie all over my face, which - in my books at least - is a very good sign indeed. JUST MAKE YOUR HOT CHOCOLATE HOTTER!! Even so, I'll definitely be paying Bill's another visit.",

I had to wait around 10 minutes for a table, which I wasn't expecting but they do provide a sofa for waiting diners so it wasn't a problem. However, while I was never made to feel hurried by the excellent staff once I was seated, the busyness of the place doesn't really encourage you to stay much after you've eaten. The food.I ordered the 'Bill's breakfast', which comes with a Cumberland sausage, two fried eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and toast. I also added the bubble and squeak, which added \u00a31 to the \u00a37.95 basic price for the breakfast and an Americano coffee at \u00a31.95.The quality of the food is excellent, although the sausage (while very good) was a tad small, with nothing on the menu suggesting you can add another one. However the bubble and squeak was fantastic. And while I'm no coffee expert, it was fine.Value.The breakfast with coffee added up to being a bit more than you'd expect to pay in a greasy spoon, for slightly less food. However the quality does compensate. My only grievance regarding price was the addition of an optional service charge. I have no criticism of the service I had at Bill's and was actually prepared to tip over the amount indicated for the charge, but ended up sticking to their total, making me feel a little awkward about not leaving a tip, as such. But that may just be a personal hang up.Summing Up.Bill's offers a good value breakfast if you're looking for something a bit more upmarket than a greasy spoon without wanting to shell out on somewhere like The Wolesley. If only they'd drop the service charge.",

My chorizo & hummous burger from the specials was something different and a solid choice (though the chorizo kept trying to escape), and served on a cute chopping board with a mini bucket of shoestring skin-on fries mmm. Among the others, the grilled sea-bream with slaw also looked pretty good, though there wasn't as much fish in the fish finger sandwich as I'd have expected.Service was a bit hit-and-miss sadly - generally took a while to get their attention. Our first server was fun, confident and seemed on the ball until she brought out the wrong bottle of wine. Not a big deal (though it didn't sound anything like the same one). We also made the mistake of saying we weren't in a rush to leave at the end when another waitress told us the card machine was being used on another table. She promptly forgot about us and disappeared, and we finally got someone else's attention after another 15mins.Good-sized portions so we (unusually!) ran out of room for dessert. Still think some of the dishes are on the pricey side for what you get (like the side of sweet potato fries for \u00a33.55?) but overall a solid choice for a group meal - esp if you're not sure how adventurous everyone is food-wise. Great shelves too ;)",

    "text": "I think we bombarded them when our group of 20 came in! According to my friends I ordered all the best stuff. I orders the sausages before my entree and it was delightful. Really nice to share. For my entree to ordered the clams in a creamy white sauce. I'm a big fan of seafood so I really enjoyed it. The presentation was also good- it came in a cute little pot on a plate of wood. The fancy drinks and floats there are also very enjoyable. Nice place for a date and is conveniently located in a nice small plaza. The only thing that went wrong was that when our food came out it came in different orders and some of us took others plates on accident which created a huge confusion. This might be a useful tip I consider for waitresses or waiters: seat numbers really help !",

Especially as the interior designers at Jamie's next door seem to have followed a similar strategy.Still, the atmosphere is casual and comforting \u00a0especially on a cold and rainy Sunday afternoon like today's. We popped in for a coffee and just couldn't resist the cakes. The vanilla cheesecake was one of the best I've had since visiting my friend Greg who makes an even better one.You can book online for the evening slots only while brunch/lunch operates on a first come first served basis.",

Yes. We're fatties. No, don't judge. I do this in the name of Yelp! \u00a0and also i know what you're thinking ; cupcakes before dinner? Do you even know me? Desserts before dinner ALWAYS! I don't take the chance that I 'might' have space for dessert. That's a shit probability.Bills is located in st martins courtyard and the area actually been done up and made lovely with most restaurants having an outside patio. If only it wasn't raining. Anyways got there around 7.30-8pm and there was a half hour wait but given that we'd eaten beforehand, it's okay. I wished they had a bar seating area. I was getting parched waiting. Finally got sat down, under a MASSIVE three longed candlestick ( if you have a fear of fire and hair, move away now lol) ordered two bloody Mary's and a mezzo platter to share. The food, was standard. Sauces were nothing special, it's just a sharing board. But the lighting is pretty , if you're the fire sort of girl, which I am. :) ill be back for the cocktails - small selection but pretty cheap for London. Getting the bill at bills (pahahaha) wasn't that smooth, ended up getting up and asking!",

The coffee was served at the right temperature, total thumbs up to Bill's barista of the day! We had Bill's breakfast and veggie breakfast. The food portion was hearty enough to feed a girl like me who has an appetite of whale! Located at Covent Gardens, I'd have to say that the food pricing would be considered very affordable and this is one chain cafe/restaurant that I'll come back to. Keep up the great quality, portion and service!!!!",

It was busy, but we were seated within 10-15 minutes after we arrived after being quoted a 20-30 minute wait. Our server never once forgot about us, even with so many other tables in his section, and was able to make recommendations that made it clear he knew the menu well. My boyfriend enjoyed Bill's calamari much more than Sartori, although I thought they were both very good. My paprika-and-lemon chicken with root veggies was incredible, as was the mini doughnut dessert. Everything was delicious, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and we would definitely go back if we could.",

The menu looked long, which in my experience is never a good sign as it means the chef can't specialise on doing a few things well.But it turns out I was completely wrong as the long menu just means that there are more options - there's a meal for every mood.Feeling healthy? Try the salad, which is substantial. The sea bass is also mighty fine.Need a treat? There's a lot of hearty meat based dishes on the menu. Prices are really affordable for central London - you can have a very good quality and filling meal for two including a drink for \u00a340 and that includes the tip. Cocktails start at just \u00a35, which is incredibly cheap. Make sure to save room for the Eton Mess dessert - it's divine.",

Unlike some of the other breakfast places in the area - this had no wait A+. The decor was super cute, the shelves are lined with jams and foods that you can purchase after your meal. As for the food, our family ordered: - Bill's Bread Basket (3.95): Came with a variety of breads and some jams- Bill's Breakfast (7.95): Sausage, Eggs, Mushrooms, bacon and toast. Super good! Definatly a must try. - Egg's Royal (7.95): Eggs benedict with smoked salmon instead. The hollandaise was to die for- Cumberland sausage served in toasted brioche roll (4.25): MUST TRY!! Looked AND tasted amazing.",

Was telling myself that I'll have to allocate some breakfast to try out other restaurants during my short time in London, but still ended up having two breakfasts here!Always love the atmosphere and decor, very comfortable and homey, even though it feels like you are eating in a hipster corner/convenient/grocery store lol.I always ordered a pot of tea with Bill's breakfast. The pot of tea was huge and the full breakfast's portion was big and delicious. Though many locals came and bought coffee to-go, made me wonder if I should try out Bill's coffee. However, my reflex every time was to get tea and usually I was too full to get another cup of coffee...maybe next time. :PAlso tried pancakes due to friend's recommendation. It was good and different from what I usually have! At first I was wondering if the syrup was enough (I am so Americanized in this aspect...), but found out that the pancake batter was already seasoned! With a hint of saltiness and extra jam/berry in the middle, it was delicious. There were also some fresh fruits on it. The price with the quality and portion was pretty good, I have not yet try other meal here yet. Though Bill's will always be the place to go for breakfast when I am in London!",

    "text": "We were heading to London on the weekend and as we were so tight for time ( travelling there & back & doing a show all in one day), I wanted somewhere I could book online and be sure of prompt service. I needed somewhere with interesting food but also with plain options (steak, for my fussy dad), good cocktails & reasonably priced. After trying Bills in a few cities I thought it was worth a shot in London.It was easy to get a table for 4 at lunchtime by booking online a week before. I picked this branch as it was central & a short distance from the theatre. We arrived on a sunny lunchtime and this is where it loses a star...the position of the outdoor space was out of the sun! Not really Bill s fault though! We took a table inside & im glad we booked as there was a queue out the door & we were given a lovely table in a quiet spot next to a sunny window on the second floor. No one barging past us & nice & close the bathroom ( which was tiny but clean). The brunch menu was still in operation at 12.15 but luckily we could pick from the lunch time menu. There is a great selection and we decided to go for burgers taking advantage of upgrading our burgers with additional items. I picked to have avocado on my buttermilk chicken! My dad had the steak and chips (no salad, no blood) & ordered rosemary and potato bread to go with it.The drinks arrived quickly, we went for a rosehip gin based cocktail, Camden Hells for the boy & cider for my dad. I like that the range of drinks are quite independent, different from other chains. After this cocktail we ordered Bills green garden, another gin based cocktail, this one fresh with the taste of elderflower, cucumber and apple. It was so delicious that we will serve it at our wedding. The food arrived! Thankfully my dad s food arrived as ordered! My burger came with the avocado on the side which worked well but I expected it to be on the burger as it was ordered as an addition not a side. The buttermilk chicken was a good size and well coated and I enjoyed the sour dough bun it arrived on. The sweet potato fries were crispy and not greasy. The chipotle mayo ensured that the burger had a kick. The beef burger looked incredible too - moist beef that is served medium or well done & this time with skin on fries. There must have been plenty as my mum was sharing them out! Tables were cleared promptly and dessert menus arrived! We were so full (& had spotted a gelato parlour) that we decided to leave it! None of the options set my world on fire so hopefully these will be reviewed when a new menu is put together. It was missing a light option outside of the ice cream. I really do love the concept and styling of Bills and how I can buy a teapot or biscuits while I'm there! If you re in London, check this branch out!",

My friend's food looked similarly lovely (and huge!)Service:This lets the place down for me...the lady that served us might have been in a grumpy mood (or maybe her 'resting' face was just naturally sour!?) She took such a long time to even allow us to order, then we thought she'd forgotten about our drinks because they took so long.
