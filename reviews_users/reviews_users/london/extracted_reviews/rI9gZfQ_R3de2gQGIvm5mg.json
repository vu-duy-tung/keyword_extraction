Service was prompt and friendly, whilst the menu is a catalogue of breakfast superstars. Will I go for pancakes or a full English? One thing for sure was I had to try the breakfast smoothie. It was delicious.I eventually opted for the croque monsieur. It was awesome. It had lovely cr\u00e8me cheese which you don't always get. I was in cheesy bread heaven. My two compatriots also looked very happy with their choices. At \u00a39 for my smoothie and breakfast I felt I had decent value for money. Joe's is no greasy spoon, it is an excellent breakfast restaurant.I will definitely be back.",

The service is timely and one is not rushed to free up a table for the next group.Most importantly the food was wonderful. I had their version of eggs Benedict. It was great. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfect. The eggs came on a bed of potatoes the were something like a latke. The portion size was right as well.Joes has a huge selection of fresh juices and shakes. If you are going to Borough Market and want a respite from the noisy crowded atmosphere that can be a little hectic and overwhelming, eat at Joe's! I will again.",

The serve a mixture of American (Burgers for examples) and British dishes with a modern twist. The menu resembles what you would find in a pub, but better quality, smaller portions, and higher prices.The d\u00e9cor is modern and you would be happy bringing a business client here for lunch. Last time I was here I ordered a steak pie and mashed potato. Unfortunately I was disappointed as the mash was included inside the pie itself. This meant that the dish was much smaller than expected, although costing almost \u00a310. They have two beers on tab (Stella and Petermans when I last visited), although there are also bottled beers available plus a wine list which I have not yet sampled. The restaurant is fairly large, and they also have some tables with benches which are suitable for groups of ~10 people.",

(Crispy bacon and fresh fruit yum) Joe's have a weeknight 20% off deal which enticed me there again for some nighttime pancake good time. Kudos to the chef for making them despite them not being on the night menu. Only downside was that they were a bit stodgy compared to the first time. Still, def recommended!",

    "text": "I have been on a quest for the past two years ... to have the best french toast that i could possibly have in London. To that end i have travelled from 202 restaurant in the West to the Diner in the East ... from Pavement in the South to Ottolenghi in the North. However the best so far has been at the Joe's Kitchen, which is barely a 15 minute walk from my home.The French toasts here are very much like what i remember from my childhood days. Plain bread fried with eggs ... without any sweetener added. If you want it to be sweet, you can add the cinnamon or the maple syrup yourself, and that is delicious at Joe's.Given that i have a habit of picking up food from the plates of my friends, i have also ended up trying the scrambled eggs (nice), omelette (delicious) and parts of the american breakfast (pretty much the english one, but with pancakes). The food has been good all along. If you fancy a drink, try the juices ... they are as fresh here as they can get.But the best part of Joe's Kitchen is the ambience and layout. It never feels as crowded as Ottolenghi, or as cramped as the Diner or most pubs. The tables are spread out thin, in a rather large area.Breakfast here costs about as much as most comparable places. You can have a big breakfast for about \u00a315 per person. Its totally worth a repeat visit.",

The decor is pleasant and woodsy and reminds me of the sorts of popular brunch chains frequented by urban professionals that you see in any big North American city. In a neighbourhood where crowds can be tough to avoid, Joe's almost always has a large and roomy table and I'd recommend it if you're in the area with a group small or large. The food is consistent and of good quality and covers all the brunch basics!",

The wooden tables and old school chairs give it a lovely homely feel and the staff are very helpful with a couple of outstanding waitresses who make all the difference. The service is very dependent on the weather though, on a sunny weekend expect it to be packed out by 11am, unfortunately the level of service goes down considerably during these busy times and the place sometimes seems to be desperately short staffed. Overall I enjoy the convenience and slow pace of Joes, a lazy morning spent reading the Sunday papers and drinking multiple lattes is my idea of a day well spent, if you like the same then head over there with a mild hangover and you'll feel much better by the time you leave.",

It always reminds me of whole grain pancakes, natural maple syrup, bowls of freshly washed strawberries, blueberries, blackberries. sweet french toast, tart orange juice, and freshly roasted italian coffee. Yes, brunch is truly the best time to eat! I'm not going to lie. I'm also spoiled with brunch in the States, We know and love our brunch. English breakfast of sausage, ham (bacon), beans and toast is nice, once in a blue moon, but it's CRAP. Sorry British people, it's true. So you can imagine how happy I was to discover this gem in the middle of London. The worst part of this place was the wait. If we were a party of two, we could have been seated almost immediately. Larger parties have to wait. Super large parties are especially screwed. Call ahead!I ordered the veggie omelette. It was really nice. Tons of spinach, egg, mushrooms, herbs. And filling! I also had a nutella shake which was out of this world! My partner had a black coffee and English breakfast which was subpar. The coffee was weak and the breakfast hum drum. Go here for variety, not for ordinary meals!",

The only place where I have ever seen Boiled Egg and Toast Soldiers on the menu, Joe's is total comfort food and so affordable. Try the fluffy pancakes with maple syrup or the Eggs Benedict... drool! London often has a bit of a caf culture about breakfast, more often than not the only place to get a decent fry up has plastic tables and laminate floors - shudder. Joe's will make all those bad memories of builder's tea and squeezy brown sauce bottles go away. My only complaint with Joe's is that they close early at 3pm on the weekends, a few times I've sadly stood outside, face pressed to the glass, mewling about how I slept in!",

The french toast looked yummy, \"the American breakfast\"? I think, looked like a british fry up but with pancakes. awesome. Buckets of coffee, nice smoothies. They have a menu but they also have everything up on the wall and then some, so don't forget to look up.I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon. The sauce tasted like straight butter, which yes sounds amazing but I was hoping for a little more of the eggy taste that I'm used to. But still, great food. Lovely place to sit and chill with friends.",

From the bites I sampled off my tablemates' breakfasts (which included the famed pancakes, among many other tasty delights,) I must say that my fruit, yogurt and granola order seemed to be the overall taste winner.I could definitely see Joe's as a perfect hangover breakfast spot as the menu was packed with solid classics and my coffee packed a caffeinated punch! I wasn't blown away (nope, not even by the pancakes... they were a bit dense for my liking...) but the staff, the service and the price was a-ok. I'll certainly come back to Joe's if I'm in the area for a market morning.",

    "text": "For a brunch spot it's not the best, but Joe's does perfectly fine french toast and pancakes. I tend to go to brunch after a big night out so I look for a few key things. 1) Thick, buttery, slightly greasy comfort food, 2 ) water (and plenty of it), and 3) comfortable seating. Joe's had decent food (other than the sausages which tasted a bit off) but the water was slow in coming and the chairs were hard as nails. It also wasn't a thrilling rec when we left half our breakfasts uneaten as they just didn't work for the decadent brunch offering.Overall, I was say Larissa said it best when describing Joe's as \"nice\" but it's nothing special an dnot worth the journey if you have other options nearby.",

(That is, English golden syrup - much more runny than the golden syrup I'm used to back in NZ, but more appropriate in this).Our coffees were ok, but there is room for improvement. \u00a0My flat white was really a latte and I was told that the Americano had too much water in it.The service was efficient, but not spectacular. \u00a0I think we got tricked into getting an extra hash brown with the fry-up. \u00a0As I had understood the server's explanation, we were just choosing between beans and hashbrown as an option for the meal itself, not selecting something extra. \u00a0(Or maybe I just hadn't had my coffee and I was confused?)The food is good enough for me to want to go back. \u00a0I liked the look of the pancakes ordered by the couple at the table over from us. \u00a0Also, the blackboard specials looked tempting (for instance - yorkshire pudding with sausages and onion gravy, served with bubble and squeak).",

    "text": "I get sad when people serve me nachos using flavored Doritos. I sit here really sad, Joe's Kitchen. When I order nachos I expect plain tortilla chips, not Doritos or some bootleg version of it. I guess the reason I am so annoyed is that the place has a very American-esque feel to it, with American menu items, like burgers, pancakes, and iced lemon iced tea. So I assumed that they would have a good handle on the nachos. Nope. They didn't. But I can't say it wasn't edible, because it was. It just was not right. The tortilla chips were flavored and they just didn't go well with the toppings. And there was a sweet after taste that seemed wrong. The peppers weren't hot in the least. Very disappointing. Yeah, I don't think this option was a winner.I think I should not have expected much from the nachos when I spied the bartender pouring out my lemon iced tea out of a Lipton bottle. For shame! \u00a0I was thinking someone had taken the time to brew the tea, drown a bucket of sugar and lemons in it and chill it. Sigh. Wishful thinking. They did pretty up my drink with some mint leaves and a lemon slice. At least the tea looked special even though it really wasn't.But the service was great: the servers were all attentive, food came out fast, reasonably priced for a sit down lunch. Worth trying again...maybe?",

I had the brunch on the lunch menu which was basically a fry up with chips - but done really well.The rest of the menu looks excellent and I aim to be back to work my way through it all. Certainly I had a hard choice trying to work out what I wanted today from several excellent sounding options. As for today, the scrambled egg was perfect, as was the bacon and the chips (oh boy those chips). My only complaint was that the sausage was a smidge dried out. In all honestly, I like them leaning towards that way anyhow, so I still very much enjoyed it.Service was great, with everyone very friendly. I look forward to returning.",

    "text": "A fantastic delish breakfast at Joe's Kitchen. Joe's should be thanking Yelp for the business, because I would NEVER have found this place without the Yelp reviews and the recent Elite event.No queue when I arrived, I was brought to a table in the corner where I could easily see the specials board. I opted to go with one of those rather than the menu items. Stacked poached eggs and a piece of grilled bacon (we Americans would call it a ham steak) on top of bubble & squeak (no American equivalent) and a generous pouring of Hollandaise on top. Check the picture! A very good and very large skinny latte went with it.Unlike last week's breakfast place, Joe's is an organized and professional restaurant. No kitchy tables and chairs, everything here is matching soft woods and neatly dressed staff. The staff had a serious hustle going on - lots of movement with drinks and smoothies organized by one team and the plated food operated by another. I wasn't rushed at all - when the time came to pay my check, the waiter brought the credit card machine without being asked.There are two very large chalkboards with the specials neatly written. I was tempted by the \"American brekkie with pancake eggs bacon sausage hash browns\" and \"Waffles w fruit salad\" as well as \"Eggs florentine\" on one list and a list of drinks on the other - pink lemonade or \u00a0vanilla caramel smoothie. All of it sounded interesting and creative. And yummy.No wifi in the place, which was unfortunate. I did manage to grab a free paper from one of the displays in front of the nearby Tube station. While the place is a few steps up from street level, they have an internal lift for wheelchairs.",

Joe's isn't perfect, but it's about as good as it gets in London.I came here on a Sunday morning with a family friend and we were seated relatively quickly, despite the packed house. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming, and homey. I was pleasantly surprised by the large serving sizes. Outrageous amounts of food are a hallmark of American brunch cuisine. I ordered a stack of fruit pancakes, 2 eggs scrambled, and a side of bacon and could barely finish it. I ended up taking most of the eggs and bacon home for brunch part 2 ;)If I have American friends coming into town (or if I can't ignore my brunch cravings any longer) I will definitely return!",

I couldn't finish it. I have also tried their eggs on toast-both scambled and poached. It wasn't bad but poached egg-smelt VEERRRY vinegary but taste was fine, scrambled-I'm quite a slow eater so, by the time I got halfway, eggs were cold and rubbery. :(BUT the sausage butties are SO tasty. Go for that, even if it is a bit expensive for greasy caff food, but worth it.",

    "text": "I recently spent 6 weeks in London for work and as a North American abroad (i'm both Canadian & American), I struggled to find a decent brunch spot. Even trusty Yelp didn't have much in the way of recommendations, but Joe's had enough reviews, and many positive, for me to give it a whirl. All in all, i'd say it was \"meh.\" I walked in from the rain and asked for a table for 1 and was told it'd be about 10 minutes. I said, \"that's fine. Can I order a coffee somewhere?\" Nope. You can't order coffee until you sit down at the table. What is that about? If I have to wait for a table, wouldn't they WANT to sell me something to get me started just to ensure I don't leave? Guess not. And I did contemplate leaving after they told me that, but I had already made the trek, so I was pot committed. The restaurant itself is a nice decor and there's a good amount of bustle on a Sunday. I ordered the Veggie Brekkie for 7.75, which is unusual for me because I'm a carnivore, but it sounded interesting, primarily because it featured Bubble and squeak, a weird mish-mash of veggies that winds up being like vegetable mashed potatoes. Also had two eggs - fried or scrambled, roasted yellow and red peppers, tomato, flat mushroom and skin-on-fries. They had decent coffee served in large mugs, which was nice, and I had a good seat by the window. The service was attentive enough, though not overly so, and friendly. The food was a bit bland. I don't know, I guess I'd say if you've got a hankering for breakfast food & happen to be in the area, you might as well stop in, but I wouldn't go out of my way...",
