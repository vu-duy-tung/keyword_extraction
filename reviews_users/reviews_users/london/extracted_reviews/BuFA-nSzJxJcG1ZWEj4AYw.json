I do, almost every weekend! The yumcha dishes are tasty and good value, better than the restaurants in Chinatown. The restaurant is also clean and nicely furnished. Staff are responsive and efficient. On top of the typical dimsum dishes, we like to order the fried squid in salt & pepper. If you go on weekends for dimsum, best to make a reservation in advance or you'll probably face a long wait.",

I was impressed with the decor which is modern and classy with pink and black colours. It does not give you a typical chinese restaurant feel so I was quite doubtful about the quality of the food but boy was I wrong!!! I really enjoyed my food there, the salted fish fried rice was delicious and fragrant and the dim sum was of top quality as well. The best one I had was the Chrysanthemum custard pau and it tasted heavenly!! The skin was crispy and the inner texture melted in my mouth along with the custard. I never had a better custard pau than that, believe me. Price wise, it is not cheap and abit more expensive than dimsum in ChinaTown, leicester square. However I am willing to pay for quality chinese food, I enjoyed the dining experience and will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Having read the above reviews, Food, on the whole, was fine. Starters were a little cold and not overly generous - but well cooked and enjoyable enough. Duck was duck, and the mains were pretty decent. However, the whole meal was let down by slow and surly service. After waiting half an hour for our duck to come, we enquired if it would be arriving soon. Our waiter barely stopped walking as he informed us it would be 'on the way'. We then let him know that we were on a bit of a tight timescale (as two of our party had a train to catch) - but despite this, the main course took a further 20 minutes to come after the duck! Funnily enough, the only thing that came quickly was the bill - and that included a full charge for the complementary wine that we had informed the staff of at the beginning of the meal. As many other reviewers have said, if Pearl Liang could brush up on their service and attitude, it would be a very reasonable Chinese restaurant in an area that lacks many (any?) competitors. As it stands, the food is simply not of a high enough standard to make us overlook the poor service.",

    "text": "I am always keen to try new places for dim sum. While Pearl Liang has been around for a while, I've not truly considered a meal there till recently. We were a group of 7, with 2 baby prams and the person who took my table booking sounded friendly and helpful over the phone. Needless to say, that made a first good impression but it was, unfortunately as far as good service went. The restaurant was busy when we arrived, and service was brusque to the point of rudeness at times. That didn't quite go hand in hand with the modern but classy interior decor, nor the friendly first impressions I'd been expecting from the phone conversation. Regardless, the dim sum menu is quite extensive, with some innovative touches to certain dishes. We ordered the usual Siew Mai (pork and prawn dumpling) and Har Gau (prawn dumpling) and they were definitely above average. The Siew Mai was actually even better than the recent ones I've had at Royal China, with just the right combination of tasty pork and prawns, without letting either overpower our senses. I thought the wasabi prawn dumplings was rather unusual, altho when I first put that into my mouth, I had't been aware it was wasabi dumplings..(cue: teary eyed sniffles)! Still, I'd definitely order that again, as wasabi dishes tend to be a favourite of mine. The beef cheong fun was soft and moist and the meat very tender. Definitely one of the better cheong funs I've had in a while. I would strongly recommend the spicy prawn ravioli dumplings in soup - those were definitely unusual, and very very good! I was especially pleased with the fried dim sum dishes.. altho these are hardly healthy. And when they first served us an assortment of only fried dishes.. my eyes nearly bulged because it looked like an extremely unhealthy spread, altho definitely delicious looking! It was later when the steamed dishes started being served that we had a good balance of both steamed and fried foods on our table. Of commendable mention is the crispy duck roll, which everyone found exceptionally tasty. Even the prawn spring rolls were quite good, and the squid cakes were delicious, although we were not provided with a special sauce for these (usually, they come with either worchestershire or fish sauce). Even then, it was extremely tastey with their house chilli sauces.. For our table of 7, we polished off nearly 25 dishes, had 4 soft drinks, and 4 portions of tea. Our entire bill came up to roughly \u00a313 per person - which astonished and delighted everyone. I can only hope the food standards stay up, as more than a few decent restaurants have recently fallen in standard. For the quality of food and the variety Pearl Liang offered, there is no doubt we will come back again next time, mediocre service notwithstanding. I should like to warn though that if it's your first time at Pearl Liang, you might wish to consider making an earlier start if you're meeting your friends directly at the venue. It is not an easy place to find, and everyone was late precisely because they got lost along the way (couldn't locate the building on the GPS) - or because they couldn't find parking. After your first time though, I'm sure you'll have no problems locating where this little gem of a restaurant is.",

    "text": "As one of the other reviewers has mentioned, Pearl Liang was opened by the former chef of Mandarin Kitchen, which explains why its seafood is so good. I come here regularly for both dim sum and dishes, and usually leave a very satisfied customer. The main difference between Pearl Liang and most other chinese restaurants is the presentation. Other chinese restaurants serve good food (e.g. Phoenix Palace, Imperial China), but they are traditionally chinese, with the emphasis on good food, but not so much on the presentation, whereas Pearl Liang serves it food (which is equally good) neatly arranged. Price wise, they are not as expensive as you would think when you first step in, which was my initial impressions.The place is quite dark and funky looking, not very traditional chinese. If you come in big groups, u'll get to sit in the rooms with the traditional huge chinese tables with the rotating discs in the centre.For dishes, we usually have the steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions, chilli soft shell crab, prawns with salted egg, lobster noodles, and crispy aromatic duck.Steamed sea bass - the fish comes with the skin on, and they will usually debone the fish in front of you, leaving the fillets with the skin in the lovely soy sauce. I can eat a bowl of plain steamed rice with the sauce. The fish is usually very fresh, with firm flakes which are not mushy at all. Just watch out for the bones, as they can leave bones along the sides of the fillets.The chilli soft shell crab is quite small, but very tasty. The whole crab is coated in thin batter and deep fried with chilli flakes. It's kinda expensive for what you get - 1 crab per portion, and the crab isn't all that big - so it's worth ordering one to try, but save your money for the other dishes.I once asked one of the waitresses (who spoke with a Malaysian accent, so I recognised her as a fellow Malaysian) whether they could do buttered prawns (\"lai yao har\"), which is something we get in Malaysia, where butter is drizzled into hot oil to create crispy lil strips which is then fried with the prawns and curry leaves to create an intensely flavoured dish, and she said they didn't have that, but the king prawns with salted egg yolk would be just as good. I tried them, and whilst I agree they were quite good, I don't think they were as good as the buttered prawns.The lobster noodles is a staple dish we order, as it is their signature dish. You order how many lobsters you want, depending on the size of your party/group, and the type of noodles you want. Most people go for the soft noodles, but I've seen people order crispy noodles as well. To each his own I guess. We usually go for ginger and spring onion, and the dish is always done well. The lobster is chopped into convenient little pieces, so the meat is easily accessible with the little fork you're given. It can be a bit messy, but you're given a bowl of water with lemon slices and fresh hand towels when you're done.The crispy aromatic duck is good, but I can't really tell the difference between Pearl Liang's version and Phoenix Palace's version. The duck itself is nicely deep fried, and it comes with the usual plum sauce with spring onions. They debone the duck in front of you, and sometimes they will even make the first pancake for you.I also recently had lunch here with colleagues, and because one of them was vegetarian, we ordered a few vegetarian dishes, which were quite good. My favourite was monk's vegetables with crispy noodles, which was really tasty. I normally expect vegetarian food to be relatively bland, but was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I suppose it had loads of MSG, but it still tasted good so I didn't care.For dim sum, my favourites are the wasabi har kao (prawn dumpling), sesame prawn rolls and the sweet custard buns. This was the first place I came across prawn dumplings wrapped with a green-tinged wasabi skin, which is delicious and makes your nose tingle as you eat it. I absolutely love them. I also like the sesame prawn rolls because the prawns are quite large and yet still quite juicy after they've been deep fried in the pastry. And the custard buns are the perfect way to end your meal. The menu doesn't specify this, but you can ask for the buns to be deep fried or steamed. I prefer the deep fried version, as this gives them a nice crispy texture on the outside, with a warm moist fluffy inside and delicious custard filling. Either way, they put lil snips all over the bun, so that it looks like a flower after it's cooked.My cousins who are on a 2-year secondment from Melbourne have raved about this place ever since I introduced them to it, and they regularly drive down all the way from Oxford to eat here. They've also told their friends about this place, and now their friends also make the trip down from Oxford regularly. You know it's good when people will drive from another town just to eat there.",

    "text": "Pearl Liang is kind of strangely located in a new plaza as part of Paddington Central. The area was strangely desserted but the restaurant itself was fairly busy. Pearl Liang has a wow impact factor when you walk in reminiscent a bit of Ping Pong style of decor but I think just a little bit classier (not that Ping Pong is un-classy by any stretch of the imagination.) The giant wooden abacus is amusing and at the entrance is a fountain and fish pond. The chairs are very un-restaurant like - pink and \u00a0I don't know how to describe them really! The toilets are hidden in plain sight so to speak behind a giant door that has been made a feature in the restaurant. Quite opulent. Pearl Liang have opted, as have so many other yum-cha restaurants, for the tick what you want style of ordering. Interestingly we weren't provided with any menus which was quite strange! We ended up ordering 13 dishes and 1 dessert dish with choices including more traditional offerings of Steamed Pork Bun, Prawn and Fried Dough Cheung Fun and the less traditional offerings of Zucchini Prawn Dumpling, Wasabi Prawn Dumpling (some bite but not as much as expected) and Octopus cake. Somehow we also ended up with about 4 differing versions of fried spring roll with the Crispy Duck Roll being the clear favourite. Good sports fellow diners also tried their hand at the tripe and chicken feet. Though neither of them were big fans of the chicken feet I think they did enjoy the flavour but found it too much hard work. The tripe came in a surprisingly tasty ginger sauce. I could find no fault with the food. It was all superbly cooked, very fresh, very tasty and definitely high quality ingredients. The menu had a few unusual combinations on it, which is nice to see, though I think they could have provided a few more options. The price is pretty spot on - including the 12.5% service charge we paid \u00a315 each (which also included a \u00a31 charge for tea each) so was it was not astronomical. If there is any where they can improve it is with the service - friendly when we got it but at times strangely slow or non-existent. For example when our tea had finished we did the universal sign for please top up with hot water (placing the lid on the handle) and not only did it take a very long time for it to be noticed when the waitress took it away to top up she never came back with it. Further, when I asked for water for the three of us the water never came and it took one of us going to the bar to ask for it again. Otherwise food was efficiently ordered and delivered. Overall a nice dining experience. I've read many reviews where it has been let down only by its service. To be fair it won't be the first or last Chinese restaurant to have that charge levied at it! Still, considering it is good in all the other areas I can't see why it can't just deliver on customer service.",

    "text": "As most know, London has an abundance of dim sum places fighting for our custom, this place is definitely one of the better ones. It is in a rather obscure, tucked away area, situated behind Paddington station. You could describe it as a hidden gem, which it is.I went on a Saturday afternoon purely to try the dim sum menu, upon arrival it was already very busy (always a good sign in my books), fortunately we had a reservation - so it is worth booking in advance if you can.Now to the dim sum, the prices are good, I'd say probably a little bit more expensive than some of the establishments in more central London. Ordered the usual har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, taro etc as I find it's always good to have a constant when comparing dim sum places. They were all good, in particular the xiao long bao, of which I've always struggled to find a decent restaurant outside of SE Asia (the best probably being from Singapore) that serves the dish. It also seems this opinion is shared with other Yelp reviewers. Overall I was very satisfied with the taste and quality.Instead of giving it a 3/5 I'm going to give it 4/5, because the decor and the setting is really very good value for money. Of course you could go to a much flashier upmarket establishment such as \u00a0Min Jiang in the Royal Garden Hotel, but you'll be paying a premium. Pearl Liang is certainly a great place to take someone on a date as it does have an intimate setting to it, both interior and exterior, what with it being a stones throw from the canal.Service was good too and I would like to go back in the evening and try some of the other dishes such as their most talked about seafood.",

    "text": "Pearl Liang used to be very close to my office and was a great spot for payday dim sum. As I still do some work with them I often find myself nearby, seldom sadly at mealtimes. Going back to visit The Insider for a post work meeting that segued into beers that morphed into a strong desire for something to fill our stomachs seemed like an ideal opportunity and so we snagged a table in the windowless space. It was surprisingly busy given its soulless office complex location in Paddington's mini Canary Wharf, Sheldon Square.Arriving after 9, even on a near weekend evening, may not have been wise. The service was abrupt, a little distracted (we ordered a second beer and they brought and served us an entirely different brand) and they were keen to chivvy towards the end. A party arriving later than us were asked for their dessert and coffee orders even as their main courses were coming out. I can understand the logic within licencing laws, but wasn't aware that it was illegal to serve coffee and ice cream after 11.We weren't really there for a long digestion of the menu and went for one of the set choice menus, given what I've heard about the usually high quality here that may have been a mistake. The selection of starters was a promising mix of mainly fried and breaded items. The squid fared particularly well, and a plump prawn encased in crisp dry noodles was similarly toothsome, though I had to leave most of my large Vietnamese style spring roll, filled with glassy noodles (and little else) before being deepfried. The one I had seemed to return most of the contents of the frier, disgorging oily liquid as I bit into it. A slug of Tsing Tao was needed to wash the taste away and the rest of the roll remained on the plate, avoided by me and uncommented on by the staff.Aromatic, rather than crispy, duck followed, with the delightful addition of homemade pancakes. In the same way as you will with fresh, homemade pasta, we really noticed the difference. We finished with four sharing bowls of varying quality. Mixed vegetables were barely cooked in a lightly spiced silken sauce, fine for snappy beans, less appetising for the large chunks of raw mushroom. mixed seafood in XO sauce was perfectly acceptable and packed with creamy chunks of scallop and squid but like the beef in oyster sauce was over salty for my palate. Admittedly the biggest saline hit came from a dry fried chicken with chilli that, while hugely moreish, seemed more like bar counter subterfuge, an attempt to get us to keep ordering lagers (if we hadn't hit last orders mid way through the mains that is...) Overall, I wasn't hugely impressed, I've had better Cantonese food than this, but I've also had better here. I don't think we got the best of the kitchen on this visit.",

    "text": "I have tried my share of Chinese restaurants in London, and this place truly surprised me! First off, the interior design is very well done, this is a Chinese restaurant I would bring a date, colleagues, friends, business associates, family, anyone really! the whole atmosphere is relaxed, and everything just seemed so perfect. It is definitely not the easiest place to find, hidden in Sheldon Court amongst the tall office and residential buildings! The entrance is right at the corner of the sunken grassy amphitheatre in the center of Sheldon Square, which is behind Paddington Station. On to the food... I went for a dinner on a Saturday night, and so we ordered a la carte from the menu. The roast duck was probably the best I have ever had; the skin was crispy but not burnt, and the meat was very tender and not very fat (common in lesser chinese restaurants). We also had friend squid, which was a tad overfried, bt the garnishings were a good complement. We also had a beef stew-type dish, and the meat just melts in your mouth. All in we spent \u00a316 per person (group of 4) for a filling meal, including green tea (but no alcohol). I will definitely be coming back here again to try their dim sum, and this will be the place I bring guests to while in the area. EDIT 17/12/09: While my first visit got 5 stars, I have now reduced my rating to 3 stars as on a recent visit, the 25% discount was refused, even though when I had booked over the phone I had asked to confirm that I can get it. The manager, Derek, was extremely unhelpful, blaming the \"system\" for not letting him give the discount. When asked if we could meet halfway at 12.5%, instead of taking it off the food bill he just took off the 12.5% service charge, while at the same time trying to make us feel guilty by saying all the service charge when to the staff. So in effect he would rather shortchange the staff who provided a marvelous service than to let the owner lose money.",

The atmosphere and decor is modern Asian and quite pleasant. Service is somewhat slow but then the place is very busy. The table management is somewhat flaky as we were made to wait even though there were empty tables all around. One would have thought reserved tables would be freed after 30 mins. Overall, I cannot say that this is the best dim sum in London, but it would be in the top 3 for sure, and price-wise, this place is absolutely fantastic value for money. If you want to come here, and I would recommend it highly, then please book in advance or else risk a long aimless wait.",

The set menus seem pricey but the portions are generous and I never manage to eat it all so end up taking home the left-overs for another meal. So good value !It's a beautiful restaurant for a special occasion or an important business meal. The chairs are so comfortable you could sit for hours.No need to book , this place is huge and that is the only downside because the place is not usually full when I go on week nights, so the atmosphere can be somewhat lacking.

In fact, I've probably had more char siu buns then you could imagine! I've tried a couple of places in London and I must admit - Pearl Liang is one of my favourite dim sum places in London! I like the whole vibe of the place and most importantly the food is awesome! I ordered the usual dim sum dishes such as char siu buns (pork buns), har gow (prawn dumplings), siu mai, prawn cheung fun, chive and prawn dumplings and thought they were delicious! One of my favourites was the wasabi prawn dumplings which is a little cheeky fusion of Japanese and Chinese but man did it taste good! They were green too which made it interesting. The place was packed and can get quite loud and rowdy but I like that kind of atmosphere. It's always full at lunch time on Sunday so make sure you book early. I thought staff were fine - not as rude as some Chinese places and the food came out quick and steaming hot which is what you want. At some dim sum places in London, they sometimes reheat the food which is not very nice. Overall, a must try for dim sum in London! \u00a0Make sure you try the wasabi prawn dumplings since they are quite unique and delicious!",

In Paddington Central and probably bustling during the week, over the weekend, its dark interior and the bright surroundings actually made me think this was shut. I still tried the doors and was pleasantly surprised stepping in to a much larger dining room than I thought it would hold. It's Chinese food with a twist, and although we didn't try anything from the normal menu, it's dim sum menu had plenty of different things to try including wasabi har gau (steamed prawn dumplings). Prices are, on average, more expensive than most other places in Chinatown and probably comparable to places like Royal China in Bayswater/Baker Street. Still, the quality is quite high and at average of \u00a32.50, it's unlikely to break the bank. All dumplings tend to be decently sized and very flavourful. The cheung fun was fresh and the steamed dough literally melted in your mouth. The wasabi prawn dumplings impressed me the best with enough kick to leave a subtle taste, without too much of an overpowering sensation. Its bright green tint to the classic crystal white wrapper also makes a startling sight. I think they charged 12.5% service here, and although I'd go back if I was in the area, it wasn't anything to make a special trip out there for again.",

Chives and pork dumplings were good as were the plain cheung fun (with sesame sauce and hoi sin sauce). Plenty of broth inside each Xiao Lung Bao like it should be. The pan fried turnip puddings were lacking in both dried shrimps and cured pork. Not the best but the texture was okay. \u00a324 for two which included 7 dishes, Chinese tea and service charge.

    "text": "I really, really like the food here. I rate quite a few of their dishes, especially anything to do with pork. It's a favourite of ours for dim sum, and a place well worth trekking to, even from East London. Pearl Liang also have the occasional special offer which you can find out about if you are on their mailing list, such as 15% off after 5 pm from Sunday to Tuesday if you book online, or a free cocktail during your birthday month.As with most traditional Cantonese places, dim sum really isn't an evening thing, so if you want to sample the full range of dim sum this place has to offer, you have to come in the afternoon, and the earlier, the better. My favourite has go to be the honey roasted pork buns - but this is really popular, and can sell out.If you are looking at the a la carte menu, you simply cannot go wrong with the Stewed Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables. It's my favourite dish that isn't dim sum, and is exceedingly garlicky, so make sure everyone else on the table eats some as well. Alternatively, if you want to put your date off, scoff it and make sure he or she doesn't get to eat any.Service can be very spotty. That's where this place fails. Sometimes, it seems like only one person is authorised to collect payments, so you have to wait for that person to become available. Also, if you have booked using a special offer, you will have to remind them as it is likely that they will forget to apply it to your bill - most likely because the person serving you will be different from the person authorised to take payments.So why have I rated this three stars rather than four? Well, the last time I went, it took the waiter ten minutes to get back to me and tell me that the honey roasted pork buns that I had ordered were no longer available. That in itself was understandable, but it was just the whole manner in which he did it. This is how the conversation went:Waiter: You know the pork buns are finished?Me: No.Waiter: No one told you?Me: No.Waiter: Well, they are finished. What do you want to do about it?Me: Well, there's no choice, right?Waiter: No. Ha ha!So, yes, one star removed for service, another star removed for making me incredibly angry. I still love the food, and I will go back in a heartbeat, but, still! That exchange still makes me annoyed.",

Our go-to menu of reliable, delicious fare usually includes turnip cake, cheung fun, crispy duck, shrimp dumplings and the steamed bbq pork buns. Yum. Some of the other dishes we had are just ok/average, like the sticky rice in lotus leaf, xiao long bao, and the beef ho fun noodles.But whatever you order, don't forget dessert! The chrysanthemum custard buns (fried, not steamed) and the black sesame balls are amazing.",

Now food, came here with a party of 7 and it is quite interesting as we ordered set menus and it was a pleasant and filling surprise. The tables move on the top so you can easily share things with other people in your table. We tried the Jade menu(check website) and it was more than enough. Overall a really good lunch. Only giving 4 stars as I do believe it is a bit expensive when comparing price to flavour experience. But still a recommend and will come back again.",

    "text": "Being a dim sum lover, other than dim sum have to be fresh and nice, I am also always looking for a restaurant that have some interesting or special dim sum compare to other dim sum place. This is what I found in this place! \u00a0To me, there are a few dim sum have to be well made in order to define as a good dim sum. Which what pearl Liang did!Shanghai dumpling with Pork (xiao long bao) - the dumpling is not over thin or thick so that is just nice for you to hold up with your chopstick and it wouldn't break. Most important when u bite into the dumpling the pork is juicy!Fried Dough - this dim sum is a fried dough wrapped in a kind of wet smooth rice dumpling skin and serve with soya sauce. the fried dough is nice and crispy when you bite in it. This shows that they only prepare this dim sum when you order it. Unlike other dim sum place in china town which u always get soft dough or over hard dough (due to refried the dough upon order)prawn dumpling - the prawn are bigger compare to other dim sum place. the texture of the prawn are fresh and \"crunchy\".Pork Shu Mai - you can actually see the prawn in the mince pork in the siew mai unlike other place is more of mince pork and fat with a little prawn paste.Their fried dim sum are not greasy and oily at all. At least I didn't see the baking paper under the fried dim sum that is oily.There are some places after you had their dim sum you will feel very thirsty and keep want to drink a lot water. I didn't have this bad after taste with Pearl Liang. So this means that they use good seasoning for their dim sum.Beside ordering our usual dim sum we also ordered a few special dim sum by Pearl Liang.PAPER WRAP SESAME PRAWN ROLLBLACK SESAME Rice BALLBEAN PASTRY WITH BAMBOO PITHS MUSHROOM CONSOMMEMushroom in slice beef rollMONKS VEGETABLE DUMPLINGThis place nicely decorated. If you want to have a relax dim sum time then I strongly recommend this place.Read about other review about their service....maybe we were seated right next to the bar so we are ok with their service. No complaint so far.",

But even these guys were stuffed. \u00a0We ordered a few dishes of noodles, sticky rice wraps, prawn dumplings, pork and shrimp dumplings (these were just ok, a bit dry), radish cake, minced meat dumplings, spring rolls, a dish of garlic fried pea shoots (try this instead of gai lan for a change), plus tons of other stuff. \u00a0I do like sticking with the traditional dim sum, so there were other things ordered that I wasn't crazy about (ie: wasabi seafood dumplings). \u00a0It's a nice place, though in general, service doesn't always match up with the atmosphere / d\u00e9cor of the place! \u00a0Unfortunately that's just Chinese / Asian restaurants in general. \u00a0Though when I do get good service in these restaurants, its always a pleasant surprise. \u00a0It was a bit hard to flag people down to order, or ask for water, etc. \u00a0But if you're in it for the food, come try PL. \u00a0And be adventurous with the food! ** I've read a comment that their xiao long baos / soup dumplings were not good, but my rule of thumb is that I never order XLB from any Chinese resto. \u00a0If they are a standard Chinese resto with dim sum and large sharing plates, then stick with that. \u00a0I wouldn't go for the XLB. \u00a0ONLY if they are a Shanghainese restaurant, and they specialise in XLB, will I order it. \u00a0The rest of their food is crap. \u00a0I'm looking at you, Dumplings Legend.",

Not exactly where I would expect to find a good Chinese restaurant, but I'll take it. The interior is very elegant and proper, with plush chairs and a large mural on the wall, and some koi fish swimming in a little pond by the entrance. \u00a0We ordered dim sum off the menu and everything was delicious... the Shanghai dumplings were particularly good, and I also really enjoyed the ox tripe and the beef cheung fun. As my family tends to do, we also ordered a second course with seasonal vegetables (morning glory and tao mui), beef ho fun, and seafood fried rice with brown sauce. I was not the biggest fan of fried rice with brown sauce on top of it, but apparently it is a regional specialty. We also got a selection of pastries for dessert, and I can say that the chrysanthemum bun at least looked very impressive. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal and would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic dim sum and Chinese food.",

At Sheldon square we found our Dim Sum heaven in London called Pearl Liang. This gem is nicely decorated all according to the chines restaurant manual with dark wood, chines dragon lanterns and pink chairs. The service is somewhat slow but still skilled, decent and accommodating. But again this isn't a 3 Michelin stars kitchen so the focus should predominantly be on the foods price and quality and folks in my opinion this is the Dim Sum place rest need to beat in London!If you are new to Dim Sum order the set platter of 10 for \u00a310.80 and start your Dim Sum culinary journey. Honey Roasted Pork buns, Monks veggi and Grape Fruit & Mango with Tapioca will make you fall in love.If you Already a fan of Dim Sums then I suggest you order the following on your trip to the DS heaven:Zingy, slightly chewy but ever so spongy Wasabi Prawn Dumplings are my absolute favorits but just as good is probably the King's Crabmeat with Egg White Dumplings generously filled with perfectly seasoned sweet crab meat or the rise paper wrap with prawns in sweet soya sauces. Fan of the fryer, then you must have the sticky inside crispy outside Mince Pork Croquettes, or the lovely crispy light and not greasy Paper Wrap Sesame Prawn Rolls. And I would, and folks I don't even have a sweet tooth, finish it all off with the rich custard buns or Grape Fruit & Mango with Tapioca. And Ladies and Gents none of these dishes cost more than \u00a33.50. \u00a0In all honestly I can't really remember not liking any of the items I have ordered on the menu but then again I haven't ordered all yet!! Pearl Liang is one of those places where you wish you could find room, to put away, just one more order or one more plate. In fact we find ourselves promising to visit it again next time in London and test the rest of the menu to see if it is equally as good. Sadly but yet gladly we haven't been able to get past the Dim Sum menu yet and this is the only reason why I haven't given it a 5 star rating yet!",

Crispy duck skin with a layer of fat which can be separated from the meat , juicy tender tasty meat. Gold mine/. Four seasons are meant to be the best ones , but give their roast duck a try ! It doesn't have as much sweet sauce as the other counterparts use, as the duck is the focus . To me , best ever , however , the duck is a lot better when you order the whole thing, so bring your friends \u00a0!! As for the lobster noodles, tasty lobster and ginger with spring onions with super qq noodles coated with the tasty sauce, these are the nooodles my dreams are made off. Dim sum and other dishes are pretty good as well . It's a trek away from the main London Chinatown area , but oh so worth it !!",

Sign me up -- this is what London is all about!Having grown up in San Francisco where you can find dim sum places throughout the city, I find myself craving a little part of home every now and then in my adopted home of Germany. Let's just say that discovering Pearl Liang during my vacation to London has been the most authentic experience so far.Admittedly, the restaurant is a bit hard to get to, though it should be convenient if you want to plan a stroll by the canals on a nice day or work in the area. I immediately noticed the tastefully posh interior as soon as I walked in. (Thankfully, it wasn't indicative of the prices!)I visited Pearl Liang twice: once for a weekend lunch and once for a weekday dim sum lunch. I'd recommend coming on a weekday -- not only is service quicker, but you can also order the 10-item dim sum platter for \u00a312.80, which offers classics ranging from har gow to shu mai as well as a grapefruit and mango tapioca dessert. The dim sum was just as delicious as anything I could have ordered back home in San Francisco, and, well, pretty much the same price as well.Don't skip the noodles either! We also had the braised e-fu noodles with seafood. Offering a slightly spicy kick, it was full of flavor and fish to boot.",

    "text": "Ugh I can't believe I'm writing this after my great experience a year ago. I came here again last week and was excited to have lunch w/my boyfriend. We were very disappointed...the prawn toast was the best thing about our meal; everything else tasted like yesterday's leftovers. I have no clue what happened, or if this or last time was the anomaly. In addition, our server, who was friendly and chatting to her other tables, could barely be bothered to look at us and was very short with us. My boyfriend said to the man who seated us that he had heard this was some of the best Chinese food around, and he replied, \"They were lying.\" I guess he's right!",

Then ordered for our family the half Peking duck, which was well trimmed, moist and fresh and had plenty of thin pancakes and julienned cucumber and scallions. \u00a0Also a silken tofu with crab and egg in a light white sauce...super fresh tofu and a gentle dish to cleanse the palate between duck bites. \u00a0Finally, the seafood crispy noodles, which was a little light on seafood but otherwise excellent, not cloying. \u00a0Overall, a couple notches above typical Chinese restaurant fare, with a number of high quality out of the ordinary dishes executed well in a banquet quality setting. \u00a0And we were able to have a dinner for three averaging 25 GBP per person.The only reason I wouldn't give five stars is the service was difficult to flag down initially, though it picked up and was attentive in refilling an excellent fragrant light jasmine tea. \u00a0Will continue to return!",

We weren't too hungry, so we ordered half a crispy duck, the soft shell crab & spare ribs in paper. The crab was good, but I found the duck & the pancakes too dry. The spare ribs, weren't falling off the bone and were slightly harder/drier on the surface, not something I'd expect with this cooking technique.I'm not sure if the crowd was too much for them, but I found them quite expensive for the quality that we received. There are so many much better options a short stroll away in Queensway.",

The Prawn Toast, though delicious, was not on the dim sum menu and a whopping \u00a38.90.

    "text": "My first impressions of Pearl Liang were bad. After entering there wasn't any staff there to greet us, only a crowd of diners in the waiting area standing there confused like we were. In front of us were empty tables with dirty plates from previous diners. Never have I seen such an unorganised restaurant. They had the tables to seat people but no one to clean them or to greet the customer. They were obviously under staffed.After an 30mins wait with a reservation, a rude woman called us in and seated us. It took another 20mins to order. Strangely the kitchen seems to be coping as food were served quickly and the experience from then completely reversedWe started with Tie Guan Yin tea in a cast iron teapot. Sadly as beautiful as it looks it wasn't good at keeping the heat in as it was designed to be placed on an open flame.Seafood crispy noodles These were cooked skilfully with a lovely balance of softer noodles and a crispier edge. The prawns were fresh and greens were stir fried perfectly. Flavours were nice too.Malaysian Kweitio with prawns. Full of wok energy, lovely seasoning and the noodles were cooked to al dente giving it good bite against the plump prawns. Delicious! Barbecued porky puff This had the perfect ratio of pastry to pork. The pork were juicy and generously filled. Flavours were perfect being sweet but not too sickly.Mince pork croquettesThese came small but I really appreciate the thin pastry and the more even ratio of minced pork inside. It was greaseless too, crisp on the outside and doughy on the inside.Turnip cake These came deep fried, almost melting in my mouth. They were generous with the turnip, sausages and shrimps which gave it a nice depth of flavourFried prawn ravioli with fruity saladQuite a forgettable dish. The pastrt was too thick masking the delicate texture of the prawn filling. The dip was almost impossible to use as there were too many large chunks of pineapple that got in the way.Scallop dumplingsThe filling was stuffed to the rim. The flavours were delicate allowing you to appreciate the freshness of the scallops. It was full of bounce, pastry al dente without being sticky.Tau mui canopy with prawn Such a refreshing dish. The earthiness of the pea shoot went well with the texture of the prawn. Pastry was perfect again, holding everything together. Yam croquette The pastry were slightly too thick and dense making it quite hard to appreciate the smoothness of the sweet yam inside. Fried dough Cheung fun A lovely addition. The rice pastry was thin and elastic. It's usually a bad idea to have it sitting in the dipping sauce but the dough inside still remained crisp and dry throughout.Char siu bun Quite disappointed. As milky, light and fluffy the bun was, there was too much of it so the taste of the char siu was somewhat lost.Shanghai dumplings Incredibly good! The pastry was al dente and held a good amount of stock that held well. The meat was fragrant and with a bit of the vinegar dip, the flavours were lifted and balanced.King's crabmeat with egg white dumpling Delightful! The addition of egg white added a nice touch of creaminess whilst the fish roe on top gave a burst of saltiness giving the dish depth and flavour. Chicken feet in black bean sauce Impressed with the size. Meat falling off the bone like it should be. They were also not as greasy as some I've had and were fatty enough to enjoy.Bamboo piths black bean sea bass roll Sadly I found the contrast of the hard crunchy bamboo far too much for the softer flakey seabass. The black bean was also too strong masking a lot of the delicate flavours of the fish itself.Bean pastry with prawn in abalone sauce One of the most generously filled ones I've had. The pastry was soft throughout being steamed perfectly. Lovely mix of textures inside and the sauce was lovely and thick to coat it.Prawn Cheung funThin layer of al dente rice pastry filled with the juiciest and sweetest of prawn. Topped over a lovely sweet soy dipping sauce. No complaints.Chrysanthemum custard bun. Best deep fried custard bun I've had. The outer layer was so thin it cracked as soon as you put your teeth into it to the softer fluffier bun. Inside was filled with creamy yolky custard that was so satisfyingly warm and sweet. Steamed sponge cake roll with custard yolk. These were so plush and soft it almost felt like they melted into a thick custard goo as soon as I ate it with a strong burst of thicker and sweeter custard flavour in between. Truly delightful.The quality of food really saved, what could have been a horrible experience. The service was somewhat worse than Chinatown. So the question is, does the higher prices justify itself here? And I can honestly say it does as nearly every dish was delicious, skilfully composed and with a touch of creativeness.",

I was a bit leary reading the previous Yelp reviews but it seems like the place has improved a little.The ambiance is good - newly remodelled and a good location within walking distance from Paddington. Dim sum is for the most part pretty good - we mostly ordered the steamed stuff so that's to be expected. The insides of the pieces were nice and chunky - not some mystery mash. Service is where the place needs to be improved. It took forever to get our second order. First order came quick but it's dim sum - you always order again...just took about 20-25 min for the food to arrive.",

We started off with their seafood lettuce wrap, wasabi prawn dumpling, and Shanghai pork dumpling and they came out in a timely order. Everything tasted great and portion was just right for the price. The Wasabi prawn dumpling was something I have never tasted before and I'm glad I did. The wasabi taste wasn't overwhelming at all and gave the whole dumpling the right amount of \"kick\". We also has a order of their Paper Wrapped Roasted Pork Ribs with lemongrass & Chili and the meat was cooked to perfection were it just fell off the ribs. All that was followed up with an order of Seafood on Fried Rice with Brown Sauce and it was interesting that they gave us bowls (soup bowls) to eat the rice in. I've always used plates so this was something new for me. Again, it was plated to be visually appealing and it also tasted great. We were already full from our meal, but we still looked at the dessert menu and ordered their sesame balls, their sponge cake and their fried chrysanthemum custard buns. The sesame balls were definitely the best of the three but I would definitely recommend trying all of them first. Will definitely come back and try a lot more of the other dishes.",

    "text": "We have friends that really rate this place! I've been here a few times and while I think it's OK, but it could definitely be better.On this occasion we had booked for a group of 7 and a baby. We arrived on time, which was also when it was opening. We weren't the first people so we had to join a que, a little bit annoying to join a que for an empty restaurant! They could have set up before opening to ensure a smoother operation. We were seated fairly quickly after that but on a table that was in direct line of the door and the breeze coming through it. Like I mentioned before, the place was empty so I didn't think there would be a problem moving is further in the restaurant (I was conscious we were going to be with a baby) I was informed in a somewhat rude manner that they were fully booked and couldn't move us (difficult to understand when we were one of the first in and there were loads of tables we could have transferred too!)Eventually the rest of our group turned up and we orderd dim sum / yum cha. The food all came out in a timely manner and the staff were good at removing finished plates. The food was good, not the best in London (see yautcha or royal China) but \u00a0not so bad. The service staff are hit and miss like all dim sum places they are mainly there for functional purposes i.e. get the food out asap. Some of them however are pretty rude with their functional skills. The restaurant is a bit of a weird shape but other than that imagine traditional Chinese restaurant decor and you'll have a good idea what it looks like. There's a small fish pond by the entrance that could do with a few more fishys.At the end of the meal the bill came to about \u00a318 each which for the amount of food we ate seemed very reasonable!",
