From chalk farm road, you have to go up some steps, so it doesn't catch your eye immediately. You enter a long room, with lots of tables, and the range of cidar displayed along the walls. The food was amazing, most things seved with fries, but side dishes including creamy mash and much more. There are lots of fabulous (expensive I have to say, although worth it!) such as chicken in creamy white wine sauces and so forth. Delicious. This is a birlliant place to go to as a special treat, perfect for birthdays, anniversiries, or even just a date with your girlfriend. The cidar is lovely, all in all, it was the perfect place to spend my new years day.",

The size of the portion that you receive is more than adequate and I always find it difficult to finish my accompanying chips! For the less adventureous amoungst you there is a large alternative menu form chicken to pasta, however,eating nothing but the mussels when I visit I can only comment on the fact that they look delicious.

The frites weren't great and the sauce on my boyfriend's steak was overly salty (presumably to make you buy more beer). Staff weren't amazingly friendly or worthy of the service charge either. Overall, a mediocre experience. Belgo's quality has declined considerably since my previous visit and I won't be going back in a hurry.",

Whenever I eat there I can never get enough of the genial hum of conversation due to satiated palates of many happy diners. There is a high turnover of tables due to the speedy service.Belgo Noord is actually famed for its Crustacean diet but I was overwhelmed by the half a kilo of Moules Classique done in a garlicky white sauce which had quite a kick to it. Then we tucked into a somewhat unusual smoked bacon, duck, black pudding and lentil salad. The flavours of the salad were earthy and pungent. The main dishes of the restaurant are robust and generally meaty affairs almost all being done in beer.For once in my life I resisited the temptation of eating a huge portion Haddock and Chips cooked in Hoegarden Batter and tore instead into a beautiful tender Lamb Shank with Red Cabbage braised in Raspberry Beer and chunky Pork cutlets cooked in a delicious creamy Apple Beer and Mustard sauce.",

The staff were helpful and friendly. They also specialise in beers from Belgium and have a wide variety.

At the top of the stairs is a perfect view of the kitchen and its mechanics below that are busy working away as you wait to be seated. There are two distinct parts to the restaurant, the right hand side with a cave esque style quality, that is more intimate and secluded, with the left side divided by a wall has a high ceiling a swathes of light flooding in from the glass roof above. The architecture aside, the food is amazing, so is the wonderful and colourful collection of beers and ales. The surf and turf, lobster and crab along with the muscles are all due a special mention. The quality of food is also unbelievable when you consider some central London prices. The only downside I can think of is the lack of parking.",

I took the chicken which was tender and accompanied with a rich mushroom sauce, the fries could have been more crispier but at the price of \u00a36.30 who can complain. They run a special Belgo Hour menu reducing the cost of mussels and other dishes listed to the time you place your order. Example if you order your food at 6:30 you would pay \u00a36.30 and so on.

Well, I'm not a big mussels fan but I had half rotisserie \"Belgo beer and apple sauce\" chicken which was very tasty. (Although literally served with warm apple sauce, I had expected it to be a 'beer and apple' sauce.) The frites served with it were unfortunately quite average, and the prices just slightly more than I'd like, but I think everyone enjoyed their meals. The only thing I didn't have, and I feel sacrilegious for doing this, is beer. They have a fantastic selection of Belgian beers with half decent prices, and that probably would have stood to add another star to my review! Worth a peek, and could be a nice (and fun) dinner date.",

    "text": "I attended a Bloggers Lobster Quiz night at Belgo last night at Belgo Noord. I ate plenty of delicious lobster (and frites and waffles too!), drank a few different Belgian beers and generally had a very good time. I've been to Belgo Centraal (Belgo's mammoth Covent Garden location) on a number of occasions, but this was my first visit to their Chalk Farm restaurant. Opened in 1992, Belgo Noord was the first in the Belgo chain. I was pleased to see (and taste!) it's on par with the Covent Garden Belgo. The quiz itself was a blast. I learned all sorts of useful info about lobsters. Did you know the lobster's preferred sexual position is missionary? Well, ya do now. It was a smart way to introduce Lobsterfest (all through June) as well. I reckon if you're looking for an affordable opportunity to make a mess cracking into a yummy creature - Belgo's the best value for money option in town. My general experience has been that the Belgo restaurants do a bang up job ensuring a decent meal, an impressive range of great beer and an overall pleasant - if kinda hokey - casual dining experience. It's worth noting that with its large tables, high ceilings and somewhat open planned seating area, the venue was conducive for last night's event (there were about 20 of us). Keep it in mind.",

I went to this restaurant about six months after it opened back in the early 90s (I lived in Camden Town at the time) and its rather more slick and trendy than I remember it back then! The food is typical Belgian fayre - rather unsophisticated but very tasty of course, and these guys would put any bar in Brussels to shame in terms of the selection of Belgian beers that they have available. It's definitely a beer-lovers heaven... My review (along with some pics) is here: londoneer.org/2011/06/be\u2026",

I initially thought she was asking me to leave :-) Not at all, she responded with quizzical European eyebrows, you pay for the exact time ordered pre 7pm. Mai oui I reposted and opted for half a kilo of the green Thai mussels in an ambitious move, as sometimes I am allergic to mussels - they send me rather doolally and give me heart palpitations. In another feat of daring decision-making, I opted for (or rather I was given) a Floris framboise beer, which translates to a raspberry beer. This would not be exciting for the average girl, however did I not mention that I have never consumed a pint in my life! Yes that's right, not at school, uniall night rave, never. Until now, and I have a secret confessionthe fruity variety I rather like. Ssssh don't tell anyone :-)",

Monks? Amazing. And now that I am older, I can fully appreciate the extensive list of Belgian beers.The restaurant hasn't changed much since it first opened- the atmospheric interior is characterised by dark, curved and high glass ceilings. The open plan kitchen allows you to watch your food being prepared and the waiters still dress up in traditional monks' habits. The Beat the Clock menu is still incredibly good value- between 5.30 and 7pm, you pay for the time that you arrive and get to choose between moules frites, a burger, sausages and mushroom.",

However, if you are, this is the place to go. \u00a0There is an obscene selection of beer and the monks are desperate to talk about what they are and where they come from. \u00a0They have fruit beer, chocolate beer, honey beer, white beer, amber beer, dark beer, pretty much the beer beyond your wildest dreams. \u00a0I would say though, if you do 'just fancy a pint' Belgo's is a little too clinical and serious for a casual drink.",

They serve a number of rare and unique belgian beers which are delicious (albeit a bit pricey) and if you go Mon-Thurs between 5-7 they have a beat the clock special so if you order at 6:30 your meal will cost 6.30 instead of 12, not too shabby for eating a bit earlier than usual!Yum yum, for sure my go to spot for mussles in London (they also have a location on Clapham High Street fyi)",

I was thinking.Look at the top of this page for the address, and then get excited.Belgo is so much more than just a place that serves mussels, but, being their speciality, they are pretty special. Whether they be creamy or winey or tomatoey or thats-not-even-a-word-y, they are huge, plentiful and gorgeous. And with their quirky, fun 'Beat the Clock' promotion from 5-7pm on weeknights... cheap! They cost the time! Genius! (That's a saving of over \u00a34 per bowl, fyi)Enough about the guns, there's so much more to Belgo than that. The interior is modern and has a showroom feel. The staff are super friendly and efficient and then menu is great. If you're not into seafood, there are other promotional offers, and their other speciality is beer. The range is enormous. Blonde beers, fruit beers, wheat beers... the lot. And, in their style of catering for all tastes, the wine list is pretty darn good, too. Oh, and don't even mention the dessert menu. I couldn't look for fear of getting sucked in.We paid \u00a335 including service and that was for two meals and a bottle of wine. You can't say fairer than that. Admittedly, it'll be more expensive on the weekend without the aforementioned weeknight promotion, but I'll definitely be going back. And back again. It's just awesome.Bel...go?Wel...come!",

I tried to book on a Saturday many times and managed to get a table for peak dinner times.Despite service has always been up to standard. This timeI was treated rudely by a particular staff. I assume he was in a managerial position as he wasn't wearing uniform. We waited over 30 minutes for our main course and when I asked him politely to check my order. He replied \"it will be ready when its cooked\" and walked away. I wasn't impressed. They have recently launched a seasonal lobster menu which was really delicious. I tried the Lobster soup which had crab meat and mussells in it and it was heaven. would be perfectly if it came with a roll.My all time favourite mussell dish is the snob - mussells in lobster sauce.",

    "text": "Admittedly here using a TimeOut offer which was a reason \u00a310 for a kilo bucket of moules, fries and a beer. We were having a quick bite before the Roundhouse, which is conveniently just across the road from Belgo.I never know what the balance of food and service is, but first impressions count right? I guess having a printed out voucher on an already swamped evening with a queue of customers, isn't really a yay situation for the manager. However, the welcome was err not welcomed. When booking, I was reminded that it is 1 bucket, 1 fries and 1 drink.. I was aware of this, thank you. Fine print is my forte. At the venue, I was again reminded, and the waiters (dressed as monks?) buzzed around us confused about if we knew about the fine print.Finally we put our order through, my guest orders an extra fries and a beer. We went for the traditionelle kilo moule which consists white wine, celery, garlic and onion. The mussels were cooked well, and the sauce was how I . The chips lacked the crispiness in bite that Belgian double cooked ones should have. The beer selection looked good, and yes I will be back in the future, but not that branch. Service really lacked, especially as I had booked early in advance, let them know it was the deal voucher that I would be redeeming. Mussels do not take long to cook. I had let them know on the phone, in person and during the ordering that there was show we were going to see, albeit it across the road.I hate to rush a meal - I like to take my time, savour the flavours, sip my drink and chat... So food wise, I may visit another branch and give them a second chance.. but with this branch, beware of the peak times, even if it is a weekday, the service is lacking. Wonder if anyone can solve the monk-like waiters mystery for me?",

Kilo pots, platters or bowls. Marini\u00e8re, Thai, deep fried in Japanese breadcrumbs, in a rich lobster, Champagne and cream bisque and so on. They also have five types of rotisserie chicken (\u00a310.95), basted in Belgo's secret spices, which Zoe and I both went for. Zoe had her's with roast tomato, chorizo & herbs and I had the sticky chilli & ginger version.James had a big fancy lunch so, out of character, he opted for a salad of Confit Duck, soft boiled egg, smoked lardons and black pudding with giant croutons and Mark ordered the Pork Belly with Belgo apple sauce, buttered spinach and stoemp mash. Antonia turned up late and ordered the smaller version of James's salad, some frites and Gruy\u00e8re croquettes, served with Belgo beer relish.As well as a couple of beers we splashed out a Schnapps shot stick, which you can see hanging behind the bar in various sizes from a 4 shot stick to one capable of holding 32, working out to about \u00a32 a shot. We ordered the 24 shot stick, which was too long for our table! The sticks come with a range of flavours, apple, peach, cranberry, cherry and something orange that was disgusting!",

I mean, I've had them a few times and enjoyed, but they wouldn't necessarily be the first thing I ordered off the menu.Well, Belgo Noord is all about the mussels and the smell was enticing me so I had the traditional mussels cooked in garlic and white wine with celery and onion. Basic? Yes. Delicious? Absolutely! They came with fries which were great for soaking up the excess sauce. Took me a while to get through the whole kilo pot but by golly I was determined!Some of my friends got a starter and a half-kilo pot to mix things up a bit but theirs didn't come with fries so you have to order separately (or irritate your hardcore kilo-pot friends by stealing theirs!) The restaurant is suitably big for the after-theatre crowd they draw from the Roundhouse, yet we had pre-booked a table so no worries there. The waiters were friendly, attentive and one in particular had great banter about him and was flirting away with a friend of mine. She gave as good as she got while the rest of us were far too busy face-in-mussels to pay them any attention! A simple and reasonably-priced meal and a very handy stop off after a performance at the Roundhouse. I would certainly recommend!",

Anyway...A friend and I stopped by here on a weekend afternoon for lunch. I mean... its Belgian. Who eats at a Belgian restaurant (besides Belgian people... in Belgium)? We had to test the waters. So glad we did. I valiantly attempted to down a kilo of the Thai mussels... plus frites... plus Belgian ale. I made it 2/3 through the mussels and thought I was going to hurl. Its a lot of mussels, be warned. That said, they were great. Lots of Belgian beers on tap and in bottles. Really cool space with great architecture. Friend loved her slow-cooked beef stew. Nice place to relax on a weekend and have a beer (and a Belgian waffle dessert).",

They often also provide good value for money, because a lot of the overheads and running costs are centralized... leaving a little more for lunch deals etc.I feel that Belgo is a good case for this.Although primarily known for the Moules Frites, I often choose the Spit Roast (that phrase always makes me think of Premiership footballers and girls of loose morals) Chicken sometimes with chili and ginger sauce, sometimes with the cream and mushroom sauce, always served with chips and a salad. It really impressive with it's bountiful quantity and tasty succulence. The decor is well thought out at Belgo Noord, and the light, airy feel puts it ahead of the Belgo Centraaaaaaaaaaal branch. Don't expect a quiet dining experience at Belgo - the open plan design adds up to a clattery experience.My first visit to Belgo Noord branch was at, of course a wonderful Yelp Event. Lobster Fest. Remember that? Well, as ever Yelp does it's job and brings me back over and over!",

We called ahead, as we have to with the card, and gave them a heads up. The room its self is massive with half of it in a low ceiling alcove and the rest has a huge skylight giving it a very airy feeling. \u00a0It was a tuesday, so maybe there were expecting to not be busy, and being that they only had maybe a 3rd of the restaurant open, i guess they wernt. But in the hour that we were there the entire area filled. They only had a manager (who was a bit of a moron), a waiter (who was trying to keep up, and was doing his best) and a cocktail waitress (who was doing alot of standing around). The food itself was tasty, but the salads were drowned in dressing and our mains almost had more chips the actual substance. The Squid salad was rubbery and over cooked and but the duck salad was much better. I had the lobster and crab burger, but it tasted more like a generic, but good, crab cake. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken with ginger which was a bit dry. We had tickets to see a film, so we asked for the bill while we were still eating. It took them 20 min just to sort out the bill. Worth paying \u00a320-ish. but i doubt i would go without a discount.",
