    "text": "I have been here several times and, as a restaurant has to be pretty special for me to return \u00a0that's high praise indeed. The food is reliably delicious \u00a0I have NEVER had a dish I didn't enjoy \u00a0and the ambience is relaxed, efficient, friendly and they don't rush you. They even have genuine French waiting staff! It used to be said that there were more restaurants on Upper Street than on any other street in London. Whether this is still the case after weathering the economic storms of recent years, I'm not sure, but I can say with certainty that Le Sacre Coeur serves the best French food in Islington. The only place that comes close is La Muse, a very small restaurant/cafe which is not far away, on Holloway Road. That is the place to go for a lovely breakfast/brunch with fantastic coffee and sit out back in the tiny garden reading the morning paper. I would have lunch there too, but for the big meal, I'd jump on the 43 and pop down to Le Sacre Coeur, where there is more space to sit and a much larger choice on the menu. Both places are unpretentious, authentically French, great value, fresh seasonal ingredients and I recommend both to you without reserve! As La Muse is so petite, personally I wouldn't go larger than a romantic dinner a deux if I ate there in the evening; but I suggest you won't be disappointed by either restaurant, although Le Sacre Coeur probably has the edge, if only to sample everything on their extensive menu. Also, it's great for any occasion; whether a family meal, a group of friends, a romantic meal, or a pre-performance meal before going to The Almeida or Sadlers Wells or one of the several pub theatres in the area. It's literally just off Upper Street, the last of three restaurants situated on the side-road where there's a zebra-crossing to guide you safely across, and is just before the famous King's Head pub and theatre, which is opposite St Mary's Church so it's easy to find. Consequently, you are the heart of the action but not in the middle of it, if you get my drift, unlike so many of the restaurants that put tables outside on Upper Street itself where the diners have to eat their meals while the whole of Islington traipses past them, including tourists, beggars, half-pissed workers, trendy bendys and the odd celeb on their way home. The restaurant, which is done out like a traditional old-style French bistro, has large open windows that open up right on to the pavement and you can sit at your table watching the nightlife go by on Upper Street and enjoy the buzz without suffering any of the less pleasant consequences.it's not impossible to find parking up that street, which is saying something for inner London, but be aware that it is inside the congestion zone. The reasonable menu prices offset the price of travelling into inner London and finding a place to park though it's near to the Angel tube station and not far from Highbury Corner. Le Sacre Coeur? TRES BON!! TRES YUMMY!!",

The food is always cooked to your liking and it's always busy (so need to book in advance!), which proves how popular it is, despite it being sightly off the main Upper Street, so wouldn't necessarily attract passing trade. The menu is extensive, but so is the specials board, so it's often hard to make up your mind. The food is reasonably priced and the staff usually friendly (apart from the time a friend asked for a Cappuccino and was sharply told that she was in a French restaurant and not an Italian - eek, but ha ha). I've eaten here at least 5 times and plan to return time and again. Wonderful.",

It has a real neighbour hood feel about the place and you never feel rushed which is a joy in this area. The food is strong on traditional French classics and they do fantastic mussels and steaks as well as some more modern dishes. The wine list is extensive and all reasonably priced. The owner is gregarious and you should be offended if he doesn't stop to have a chat. The staff are friendly and service is efficient. You don't need to book during the week and at weekends if its full they usually will tell you to go to the pub opposite and return in half an hour \u00a0definitely do this rather than be seated at the bar, the bar is tiny and you are very much in the way of the waiting staff. This is the sort of venue that is good for everyone there are couples of all ages, groups and families and all are catered for. If you are in this part of town I would definitely recommend that you should check it out.",

It's a homely, cosy bistro style interior and small, intimate tables but perfect for two or a small group.The menu is straightforward French classics. There were several dishes that looked good and with the waitress reco I ordered the boeuf bourguinon. A generous portion with large meltingly tender chunks of beef, plenty of mushrooms and a great sauce. Just what I was hoping it would be. Served with mashed potatoes, it was a perfect comfort dish.My partner's choice of pan fried king prawns with vodka and chili was an equally good choice and perfectly cooked and flavoured.We shared a perfectly executed tarte tatin for desert with ice cream. A good sized portion as it should be and just right.Service was great, unobtrusive yet attentive and just the right timing. Value for money was also excellent. \u00a0Looking forward to going back.",

Everything was perfect - from the friendliness of the staff to the calamari, to even the cleanliness of the toilet! We went as a big group and so we had the 3 course set menu costing \u00a321.50 each excluding drinks. It was fantastic value for money. I had the calamari for starters which were delicious, rib eye steak for mains which was pleasantly surprisingly good (excuse my rubbish English today - I'm still in bed!) and a crepe au chocolat for dessert. What I liked most was the cozy atmosphere. The lighting was perfect and it was just an overall very pleasant dining experience.",

The service is welcoming and efficient, the prices are good and the menu delicious. I usually opt for the specials as they are ever changing and know I can rely on the food being excellent.The atmosphere during busy periods creates the buzz of chitter chatter, while still being able to hear the person you are dining with. There's also a feeling of intimacy despite a full restaurant.By day it's quieter and has a relaxed atmosphere and a fixed price menu option. If you are going to see a play at the Almeida Theartre, Le Sacre-Coeur offer a discount off your meal. When on one occasion the waiter forgot to provide a discount, a rather out of breath manger caught us up outside the Almeida to provide the discount. Out standing service and top class cuisine.",

The waitress was charming and attentive, offering a well timed five minute prelude before our wine (a modest bottle of Pinot Grigio) was delivered. Perfectly dim lighting with tables (note the lovely rustic checkered tablecloths) were positioned fractionally too close together, however this did not prevent free flowing banter with excellent company. My buttery monkfish was served with crunchy, moist vegetables and a voluminous rocket and parmesan salad that 'minimal portion' eateries could certainly take a leaf out of! Previous culinary recommendations also include the hearty Toulouse sausages, although the coq au vin left a little to be desired and rabbit pushes my moral taste boundaries! A great choice for understated intimacy, well worth the extra five minute flutter from Angel station. Certainly sacred in my heartc'est vrai!",

They tasted simply delicious. I don't know what kind of seasoning they use or the exact way they prepare them, but if you ate one with your eyes closed you would have never ever guessed that you were eating snails.The service and decoration there are both amazing. The place is decorated in a typical French style- tables covered with checked table cloth and lovely flower pots. Upon arrival a very nice and friendly young man asked us if we preferred a table on the pavement as it was a very sunny day. He later helped us chose our dishes while explaining the one we were interested in and making suggestions.Overall I think this is a very nice place even though it can come as pricey for some people, but I thank this little French restaurant for making snails one of my all time favourite dishes.",

I started with the Camembert Frit (Camembert cheese coated in breadcrumbs, fried, and served with redcurrant and raspberry coulis). This was delicious! The cheese paired so well with the raspberry coulis and it was no greasy at all (perfectly fried). For my main course, I got the Steak d'Agneau au RomarinGrilled lamb steak with red wine & rosemary sauce (served with saut\u00e9ed potatoes). This was delicious as well! The lamb steak was so tender and flavorful and the sauce went so well with it. The potatoes also went very well with the lamb. I have also had their Filets de Cabillaud R\u00f4ti(baked cod fillets with sun-dried tomato and cream sauce), served with leek and potato mash. This was excellent! The cod was so fresh and the sauce was to-die-for! I could have licked all of the sauce off of my plate (if it were socially acceptable haha). The sauce was so fresh and paired so well with the fish. The potato mash was also fantastic--perfect texture. For dessert, I had a rhubarb tart. This was delicious! I loved how the tart wasn't too sweet and I could really taste the rhubarb. The service was also excellent. The servers and managers were very attentive and considerate of my husband's allergies. They were super accommodating, which is the reason we came back again! The have a great price for their prixe fixe menu.I would definitely recommend this restaurant! In a nut shell, great service, excellent food, fair prices and great ambience!",

    "text": "We found this lovely little family run French Bistro tucked away just behind Kings head Theatre in Angel. Difficult to find something decent to eat that late in London, but this place is ideal for theatre goers. They seated us quickly, and all the service was with a smile. They have a cut price dinner menu for 25 euros and even the alacarte is so reasonable. My hubby ordered the steak with pepper which was delicious, salad and a cheese plate. I had onions soup and the confit duck. We were not drinking but I had a virgin Mary, sparkling water and tea and coffee. In all we paid 60 quid for two. For that part of town, very decent food , it's a steal, and way cheaper than Paris and also better I dare say. The confit duck could have been moister but guess they were getting the steak ready so it sat out for too long, that's my only criticism, but on the whole definitely going back Great service!",

    "text": "Went with my partner for lunch, and I have to say that we had an amazing experience! The ambiance is SO cute, very French, and warm. We both had 3 courses which was priced extremely well at 10.95. We had the king prawn tempura and the warmed smoked bacon and chicken liver salad for our starters. The king prawn tempura was only alright with 4 medium sized shrimp (I wouldn't call them king prawns) and a side salad. The bacon/chicken liver salad was the winner as it was a large portion of yumminess. We had the moules frites and the croque madame for our main courses. The mussels were AMAZING and the broth was rich and creamy. The pot was MASSIVE and totally worth the price. The croque madame was decadent and delicious as well. We both got the lemon sorbet and raspberry coulis as our desserts. We were already SO full but enjoyed them nonetheless. Aside from the tiny king prawns (which wasn't a big issue), I can't say anything negative about this place. It's my most favorite French restaurant and would highly recommend it to everyone!",

If the doors not closed it will stay open.Ok so inside lovely decor, French music lovely ambiance. Get the menus. Some aspects tip ex over and hand written and in a polly pocket. I had to smooth it out and even then couldn't read it properly. I decided to go with the set menu.I had onion soup. Steak and fries. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e to finish. Food was ok nothing special to be honest. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e had to be the highlight. Cost \u00a322.50 for set menu - 10% service charge. Now that is the fun part. I like to pay gratuity where it is earned. During my meal not once did anyone check how I was with my meal. If I required anything. Nothing. I had to ask for the bill by getting staff attention. Seen as though I went alone no one made the effort to talk to me either which in other places staff have. In this vicinity for French food I preferred Le Mercury.",

French cuisine is pretty heavy, so you probably won't need appetizers unless you're extremely hungry.That said, I found it almost impossible to choose an entree because everything sounded amazing. I ended up ordering the T-bone steak, which came with a side of baked cheesy potatoes. The potatoes were heavenly, and the steak was of a substantial heft. The gravy poured on top of the steak was a great complement to both.We washed it all down with a bottle of their Sauvignon Blanc, which was really good. Also worth mentioning is that their menu is very vegetarian and pescatarian friendly, so don't be deterred by all my meat descriptors!The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. My only regret is that I missed the Sunday roast that they do here!",

The downside to this place is the atmosphere. Although the decoration is nice, there are twice as many tables in the restaurant as there should be. This results in large noise levels along with the fact that the table next to you can hear everything you are talking about. And then there is oilcloth on the tables.

There was only a touch of broth at the bottom of the plate, and the mussels themselves were dry and a bit rubbery.This may be the type of place that's touch and go, and they do some dishes very well and struggle with others. I will say, though, that the creme brulee was delicious, if a bit heavy.
