This place reminds me of Flat Iron with its simple menu and sides. The lobsters were not bad. Decent size for \u00a320 a lobster. So why 3 stars? I come from the city of Los Angeles and having lived next to the beach my whole life, I have had plenty of tasty lobsters for a more reasonable price. I understand its London and while the main dishes were good, unfortunately it wasnt good enough to stand out in my mind. Or at least compare to the lobsters I have had.I would probably recommend just getting the whole lobster, compare to the roll (the roll is only served cold by the way). I wouldnt mind going back again if I dont know what I should eat when Im back, however it wouldnt be my top go to place. The service was average and ok. For those that doesnt get lobsters often, give them a try, its not bad at all. For the seafood fanatics, there are probably better choices out there. Overall a decent establishment that I would recommend.",

There are basically 3 mains on the menu.We got the whole lobster and the lobster wrap.I will definitely recommend the whole lobster for those looking to have a generous portion of succulent meat for just 20pounds.They have it in garlic or steam. Definitely go for the steam if you are not a garlic fan as the garlic taste might be overbearing.Alternatively, the wrap offers a easier dining option as the meat are mixed with fragrant garnish and placed into a bun which is DELICIOUS.Every meal comes with a side of salad and fries so you will definitely leave full.They do charge for water though.The staff are amazing friendly and helpful.",

Relatively the food was ok but the customer service was very surprisingly-BAD! \u00a0We went in at around 2pm which was after the busy lunch hours. There were not too many people so we did not even need to wait for the seats. After we sit down, we asked for water and shortly we ordered our food. our waiter basically disappeared after our order..( he was just standing there and chatted with others). We tried to do eye contact with him but he seems just ignore us. After couple times attempt, I couldn't take it and had to ask another waiter next to me to get us the water! We got our water after we almost finished our food! our waiter basically just showed up with our bill at the end of our meal. \u00a0We paid $$ for our lobster meal and also be charged for the water. I did not expect this kind of service honestly with this charge. Husband and I agreed that we would not go back to this place.",

So one Friday last minute me and a friend managed to catch up and we chose Burger and Lobster as we both wanted to check it out. I looked at the reviews of a few branches of this chain restaurant and this one had the least waiting time as well as being extremely central. We both ordered for Lobster Roll with chips and salad. The Lobster Roll is gorgeous, this is the second Lobster Roll I have had, the first being at Bob's Lobster which was amazing. The roll was brioche, slightly toasted and absolutely gorgeous. The Lobster meat was lovely, it is mixed with Japanese mayonnaise. The chips were crispy and fluffy, just right and exactly the way I like it. We also had garlic butter which was flavoursome, not too creamy or garlic which worked quite well. The salad was as tasty as salad can be. I ordered a hot drink which was just perfect for the cold weather outside, unfortunately I don't remember the name. I would definitely come back here for the Lobster Roll. If I feel adventurous enough, I might try the Lobster.",

I got a lobster, and more than I bargained for. Apparently my lobster was smaller than usual so they gave me an extra half lobster. I was beyond happy. The lobster comes with either butter or lemon garlic sauce. I felt that the lemon garlic sauce didn't quite complement the lobster and slightly overwhelmed it... But please try the fries with this sauce. Out of this world!Their fries are decent but I didn't like their salad - spinach with some nuts and caramelized onions with a balsamic-ish dressing. Would I come back? Hell yes and with a bib!",

We were a table of 6 stuck in the middle of a huge communal table in a crowded restaurant sharing next to a grumpy looking family. And you want me to pay \u00a38.50 for a cocktail? How about no?! The fact that Burger and Lobster has become nothing more than a production line should be no more evident than the fact that the food comes out in less than five minutes. The food was fine. It is what it is. And yes there are three options so they don't have to make it from scratch, but it feels like a child's birthday party. If you do want to treat yourself to lobster, then go to any other nice decent place. They don't have a monopoly on lobster! Spend your money on somewhere you'll feel like an actual guest in the restaurant not another number through the door. Can you imagine even ordering dessert here?

Retreating to The Social next door, we had a drink and were called half an hour later. Returning, we were greeted with a smile and seated at two tables. Beers and lobster were ordered and went down a treat, they came very quickly though, quickly enough that I thought they were already prepared, but they weren't overcooked at all. We shared a couple of desserts, but what they described as a cheesecake was honestly more like a parfait, it wasn't set at all. Taking off one point for the dessert (I love making cheesecake, so don't call it one if it so obviously isn't!), it gives a four star awesome review. Honestly I was full and didn't need the dessert so ordinarily wouldn't have noticed but unfortunately I did!",

    "text": "Somewhat overly praised, Burger and Lobster is simply a place to have (guess what?) burger and lobster. Yes the lobsters are fresh as the turnover on them is so quick and this branch actually has several tanks for all different sizes of them. However, I find the lobster has little flavour, the garlic and butter sauce it comes with is flavoursome but too salty and the fries are also noticeably more salty than necessary. Nevertheless this branch of Burger and Lobster seems marginally better than the one in Soho in all respects. In comparison with Soho, the service here is good with very little waiting time for a table and prompt arrival of food and drink upon ordering. On previous visits to Burger and Lobster I have tried the burger which was unremarkable and salty and alongside the salty fries can leave you very thirsty; I have tried the portion of lobster for one person twice and to anyone who likes eating lobster it is worth trying out for novelty value but for someone like me who is accustomed to having lobster it can seem rather unextraordinary; in contrary, I do recommend their lobster roll which is a unique and delightful combination of melt-in-the-mouth brioche with a lobster and mayonnaise filling giving it a pleasant but not too strong taste. The portion of lobster roll does appear quite small for a main course and may not fill you up on a hungry day but the side salad and chips that come with every meal help. The burger and lobster apron, open kitchen, interesting cocktails and restaurant setting all succeed in creating a nice experience but not quite exceptional.",

After only tasting lobster for the first time earlier this year, it's fair enough to say I am fully obsessed with it now. So you pay \u00a320 and get 3 choices, burger, lobster or lobster roll - not too sure why you'd choose the burger!! I obviously chose the lobster which was really good. It came with a salad, fries and gorgeous butter sauce. The lobster was cooked to perfection.The staff were very helpful and friendly. I'd brought a cake for my friend and they were more than happy to look after it then bring it up after we'd finished our dinner.",

The restaurant is really hidden on Little Portland Street and you would not have expected to find a restaurant there.The restaurant is not as big as their Soho branch but have two massive long table for a feast. We booked a table at 6pm and it was not very busy when we arrived. But when we left around 8pm there was a crowd of people at the entrance.Having been there many times I already knew what I wanted which is lobster! I shared with a friend a lobster roll, and grilled lobster. We had half each! The way to satisfied my tastebuds!I washed this all down with the BL iced tea which had watermelon. It was a really refreshing drink and they even have a alcohol version.The food was just as good as the Soho branch and still it is the best place for lobster in London that is worth the price!",

I see why a local would become a regular here. The prices are amazing-ly cheap for London.For those in america, i could rate the burger like a better version of super duper burger. It was juicy and the size made you want another. The lobster was tasty. Usually i have to add many add ons to make it good for me. It is located in a very busy part of London, so if you walk from the train station be prepared to battle crowds. Its recommended",

A quick search on Yelp lured us to Burger and Lobster, which was a fun experience. The menu has either, yup you guessed it, burgers or lobster on it. You could also get a plate with both to try the two. Hubby being a lobster fan, directly went for the lobster plate, and I, having an aversion to lobster went for the cheeseburger. We also ordered olives and nuts, alongside a huge fishbowl of some delicious rum-filled drink to share. The olives and nuts came out quickly and they were well portioned - very generous actually. The fishbowl came next and was good but not great. You could taste the liquor but, as is normal with these types of drinks, the drink was kind of watered down. Following some sips, our main dishes came out. Like before, the portions were really big, and food was pretty delicious. It had been my first burger in months so that might be why I thought it was so good but that's besides the point. Hubby thoroughly enjoyed his lobster, any we could both barely finish our plates because they were so large. Overall, a great experience minus the hefty price tag (but then again, everything in London is unnecessarily expensive).",

    "text": "Sorry to disappoint everyone, but I didn't see what the hype was about. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things to love about this upmarket chain. If you love love LOVE lobster, this place is a must try. The only reason I'm giving this a 3 instead of a usual 4 is that I got a violent upset tummy shortly after leaving the restaurant and I question how sanitary the servers are. So let me break it down:Food: The food tasted as good as it looked: steamed lobster with herb and lemon butter all the way. They only serve three main items: burger, lobster (steamed or grilled), and lobster roll. Albeit, a simple menu, I just find it weird there isn't a menu for me to hold or look at when I sit down. This caused further confusion, because my friend misheard the desserts and ordered something completely different to what she thought it was. They were nice enough to take it off the cheque though.Service: The servers were really understanding and patient with us. One thing my friend pointed out was that the servers (at this branch anyway) were a bit too friendly with each other, and we saw them slapping each other butts. I thought nothing of it, but to people who are germ-a-phoebes, like the friends I was with, did not find it amusing. After all, they do touch people's food in between joking around and slapping each others bums. Perhaps that was the reason why I got sickOverall, I don't think I'll be coming back on my own volition; but if someone really wanted to go, I wouldn't mind tagging along.",

    "text": "This place is so good!!I've been wanting to try Burger and Lobster for a while now after hearing really good things about it. My husband and I were shopping late at Oxford Circus and realized that this branch was nearby, so we wandered on over. We were seated right away and ordered a cocktail and a beer before deciding on what to eat.This place doesn't have a menu but serves just three dishes; the lobster roll, whole lobster or a burger. All at \u00a320 a dish, served with a salad and fries. \u00a0We ordered one grilled lobster and one steamed lobster, getting both the regular butter and garlic and lemon sauce. The lobster was a really good size (I think 1.5lb) and tasted amazing. The steamed lobster was more juicy than the grilled, so I'd order that one next time. For dessert we had the chocolate and vanilla ice cream and an espresso. The ice cream was surprisingly delicious! It had a biscuit layer on the bottom, with chocolate and vanilla soft serve ice cream, topped with brownie pieces and caramel. Yum! The espresso had a really nice intensity too and exceeded my expectations.Overall I thought it was fantastic value and a delicious treat- my only criticism would be that they seemed a bit short on servers. I would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Here's all you need to know: I was in London for two nights. I ate here both nights.(Strictly speaking, that's not exactly true. The first night, I ate at the Burger & Lobster in Mayfair. But you get the idea.)After enjoying a lobster roll my first night in London, I fully intended to eat dinner somewhere else the next day. But after a late night of shopping, I found myself at Oxford Circus at 9pm with an empty stomach. I checked for nearby restaurants, and lo and behold, another Burger & Lobster was just a few short blocks away!The Little Portland Street location was much, MUCH less crowded than the Mayfair location had been the night before. I walked in and sat at the bar, ready to order at once. Then I realized why I was the only one sitting at the bar. While seated in the barstools, the bar itself practically reached my shoulders! Clearly there was no way I could competently eat a lobster raising my arms that high so I requested a table instead and was swiftly seated. That hiccup aside, the rest of my dinner was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the grilled lobster and it was just amazing. Of course the fries and the salad were terrific, but I already knew that from my experience in the Mayfair location. I had never eaten grilled lobster before and did not realize what a treat I was in for. I think it was probably the best \u00a320 I've ever spent on food. As I was leaving, I noticed a sign proclaiming the imminent opening of Burger & Lobster's NYC location. As that's a bit closer to home for me, I absolutely can't wait!!",
