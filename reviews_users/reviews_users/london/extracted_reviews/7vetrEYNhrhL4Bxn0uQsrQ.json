They make their own beer on site of which there are normally 3 or 4 different varieties and they have a restaurant section where you can get everything from fabulous pizzas, mussels and fries various pasta dishes and good tasty salads. It tends to be a bit noisy at the weekends so it's not a great romantic dinner place but great for a night out with friends especially as you can wait in the bar for your table then eat then go back to the bar without leaving the building! It is very big so it is normally only a short wait for a table even at peak time and the food is always very fresh and tasty. It's certainly a Blackheath hot spot!",

Prices are reasonable (\u00a32.70/pint) for what turned out to be really fresh, tasty beers, it's good to be reminded how much impact pasteurisation and old age have on beers at most places. They also had wines and cocktails but I can't comment. Then we moved on to the page of pizza options at the restaurant, I can recommend the mango and tandoori chicken. There were also pastas and the usual meat-based mains. They were nice big pizzas with lots of topping and super-friendly staff, good to know that if you do add the tip on the credit card bill it gets shared between the serving staff. Worth mentioning that I'd love to split the rating between a five for the beers and place as a bar (you can also takeaway kegs!) while the restaurant is a four.",

I think the menu has changed recently with a few too many experimental pizza toppings for my liking. They need to stick to doing the basics well or risk upsetting the winning formula here.

The customer service is especially good and the bar staff will be more than happy to provide you with a try before you buy. Th summer beers over recent years have been great - think mango beer, banana beer etc. Even better, they do take away casks which you can buy from the bar and take back home - ideal when they ahev their seasonal beers. Try the wheat beer too - but make sure you get a train or taxi home! Very recommended. I found the food offerings fairly average.",

We had some of the best pizza we've ever tasted, with the menu's creativity being a big plus point (we heartily recommend the Peking duck pizza!) The staff were very friendly and polite, and service was quick. We liked the venue - the modern, industrial feel is a change from many Greenwich/Blackheath restaurants. The beer, which is put forward as somewhat of a USP, didn't leave much of an impression. That said, we might be spoiled by the close proximity of the excellent Meantime brewery. Our only significant criticism would be that the restaurant was far too cold - that a number of diners were sitting in anoraks should have been a warning sign! It was the first week of January and the cavernous layout of the restaurant probably makes it hard to heat, but all the same this was a disappointment in what was otherwise a very enjoyable visit. We will certainly go again, but perhaps not until the spring!",

    "text": "Zero Degrees is a fabulous bar and restaurant! It's a microbrewery and they only serve their own (tasty) beer plus various wines/spirits. They also do food along the lines of pizza, pasta, risotto etc. which is similarly good quality and decent value. The atmosphere is great with a buzz of conversation around the room. The service is really friendly and you can see even the staff seem happy to be there. Zero Degrees is very popular so I suggest booking a table if you're going for dinner in a group.",

    "text": "Well, I've been to Zerodegrees twice now and had one great meal and one bad one. I do like the atmosphere of the place (who doesn't like a microbrewery???) so I would definitely go back, but now I know what to avoid menu-wise.The first meal I had there was mussels and yes it's true, they do cook them well here. I opted to go classic with the mariniere sauce and it was tasty. I was also impressed that they offered so many different mussel options.The second meal I had here was, well, kind of gross. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad. I know that when you put hot chicken on top of lettuce and other cold items the chicken will cool down, but by the time the salad found its way to the table the chicken was ice cold. Whatever BBQ sauce they used was definitely low-end from a bottle and the corn tortilla chips were cold and greasy too. It was one of those meals where the whole time I was looking longingly at the pizzas and fries everyone else had ordered. I suppose that's what I get for trying to be healthy.",

    "text": "I straight up, LOVE this place.Ok. I'm a little biased. It's one of the first bars that I started going to when I first moved to London. But in my opinion, if you find yourself in Blackheath one evening, there's no better place to start. The mood in there is pretty good - there's a few pretentious sorts floating around Blackheath, and I guess one or two of them could wind up in here, but not enough of them to sour the mood - a good cross-section of people, certainly no scumbags in here though.The restaurant, which is located in a sunken area to your left as your walk in is excellent. A great mix of food, cooked up by an open kitchen which is viewable from most of the restaurant and bar. Great mussels hear... I promise! The bar serves up the usual mix of wines and spirits but the highlight is the beer selection which comes straight from Zero Degrees' very own microbrewery. Tubes travel from massive tanks in the front of the building, up to the high ceiling and down into the bar, delivering some of the nicest beer I've ever tasted. Ales, Lagers, Bitters, Stouts - all catered for here and VERY reasonably priced. (\u00a32.50 last time I was there). There's a comfortable seating area tucked around the back section of the premises which has a TV for those wishing to catch a bit of sport and extra seating upstairs as overspill for the restaurant (which looks down onto the main area),Give this place a go... if I still lived in Blackheath I'd still be going there now - but I still get the urge to return now and then and it still doesn't disappoint. Top place!",
