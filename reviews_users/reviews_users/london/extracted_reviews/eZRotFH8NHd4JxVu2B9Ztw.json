The apps were unmemorable. I had the tempura crab and some sushi roll.. The main (seabass) was ok..very well cooked but... to sweet for my taste. The best part of the meal was actually the olives they serve at the bar! Haha I couldn't stop eating them. Also the cheesecake dessert was amazing and quite large. \u00a0Definitely shareable. The service was great from the time we entered until the time we left. \u00a0We didn't have a reservation and the could have been rude but they worked us in. And our waitress, Canadian girl was lovely. Would definitely return for the ambience. Definitely a sexy place!",

On a bill of over \u00a3500 I would not expect to be told - with food still on the table, and wine yet to be poured - we have people waiting for our table and asked to finish. Great food, matched by great arrogance. After some heated discussion a 'lucky' table was found at the bar with desserts complementary, but the damage was done.",

I can't recommend anything as to me it was just food nothing special (Probably the sexy fish version of porn star martini was the best thing ha please keep them coming I shouted ;P )Dishes rank from \u00a310 to \u00a330 each unless you have, wagyu beef \u00a3100 per 150gr or caviar I think it was \u00a3100 per 100grDecor. Sexy fish belong to Caprice Holdings, owned by restaurateur Richard Caring, \u00a0he also has the Ivy, J. Sheekey, Le Caprice, and Scott's, so no surprises they have expend \u00a320 millions in decor' with great names as Martin Brudnizki Design StudioFrank GehryDamien Hirst Michael RobertsArt is the main thing in this place, marble walls, pink leather sits..Tbh there's toooooo much going on, and the colours don't blend together, that's my humble opinion. A giant black crocodile hanging in one of the walls, a mermaid and a shark on another wall and the ceiling it's just too much..They also have an open kitchen. However my fav was the bar with water cascades windows, the mermaids at the end of the bar and the shimmering fishes hanging on top.Apart from the main dinning room They also have a private room in the lower ground floor, called The Coral Reef Room, with the largest\u00a0live coral reef tank in the world (apparently)Atmosphere, wealthy people you can smell the money Service was ExcellentAlthough I must say when we first arrived, sexy fishes Pet was awaiting for us' a no so sexy baby fly was going around the tables, certainly not impressed, at first we laugh but by the end of the starters I've had enough and I told the waiter I even showed it to him, he didn't know what to say, after a while I remember ordering our main and wondering where's our waiter, he and the pet went MIA, as a guy with a bright blue jacket was serving us, whatever they did it worked ha I didn't really talk about the food cos I don't have anything good to say, I definitely will give it another go, maybe another day and probably lunch, right now I think it's ok' Maybe overrated but hey right now it's the hottest place in London'",

We thought to give it a try and see what the hype was about. On the exterior the restaurant looks fun, inside a pretty open space. We were greeted nicely. So here is the interesting part- we are pretty big foodies so we're excited to see what they had to bring to the table. We order a few items- wing skewers, octopus, duck salad, sea bass, Madagascan prawn and a few more items. Although the restaurant and service presented itself like a well designed place, the food was surprisingly underwhelming. Duck salad was nice, dressing was well done, but we weren't wowed. Skewers were fine. The sea bass we were surprised was over cooked but the dish itself wasn't amazing like when you go to other restaurants with a miso cod or bass. We were a bit disappointed. The Madagascan prawn was under seasoned and not much to write about. A few of the dishes seemed to be a bit on the heavy side (bass and veg seemed to have a layer of butter or oil)I can say the rice crispy green tea ice cream was very nice.Wine is punchy as well as a glass is the price of a bottle bought anywhere elseHope this helps those of you foodies debating to dine here.",

The food was also stunning - the yellowtail sashimi and soft shell crab maki were both stunning! The Chilean seabass was also very tasty, similar to the black cod you would get at places like Nobu.

Our local guide has once again not steered us wrong as Sexy Fish was excellent. \u00a0Service is amazing. \u00a0Our waiter was attentive with good humour and random servers were often dropping by to make quick, and unobtrusive, work of dish cleanup or glass refills.The spicy tuna maki we started with were good but unremarkable, that was really the only slight setback of the night.Beef skewers were delicious and deeply marinaded. \u00a0The creamy wasabi dip was a prefect compliment. \u00a0The prawn gyoza were delicious and we fought briefly over the fifth gyoza.The lamb cutlets were very good, the cucumber side dish with the slight mint flavour worked very well as a complement. The Mizo Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was the highlight for me and was a surprisingly large serving for a London restaurant. \u00a0We almost skipped desert but decided to indulge in the vanilla rice pudding that was truly worth every calorie. \u00a0The pudding itself was creamy and cooked to perfection. \u00a0The whole dish was served hot and quickly, the vanilla ice cream added as a topping was still perfectly chilled upon arrival. \u00a0Speaking of the ice cream, it was sweet, rich and full of vanilla; \u00a0it bodes well for anybody ordering an ice cream or gelato as a desert.",

    "text": "Underwhelming to say the least. I have been to plenty of nice restaurants in NYC and this falls short in almost all categories. \u00a0The food is okay. It is simple and unimaginative. The service is slow and the waiters do not explain the dishes well. It is also incredibly hard to get a cab when leaving. We waiting 30 minutes and eventually used uber. Maybe its a london thing, but they do not call cabs here. Doormen were useless. Expectation of a restaurant like this should be for them to run down to a busier corner to hail cabs. \u00a0Again, its lack of service.Also watch out for the 4 pound cover charge. This is different then the service charge. It is just a random 4 pound charge to scam you essentially. If you ask them to remove it, they will but obnoxious they put it on in first place and most people either don't realize its there or just accept it and do not ask.I will say it did have a good ombionce. A very trendy feel. Surprisingly I was seated right when I got to the restaurant instead of being shown the bar which is always a plus.At end of the day, there are clearly better restaurants than this in London especially for the price. \u00a0It is new and hip but thats about all.",

All and all I would say I wouldn't be back anytime soon. Therefore I can only give 3stars for the actual place and design , 1star for the food !",

    "text": "I'm told it's THE place to be right now. And when you walk in it is indeed extremely seductive. Water cascades down the walls, and it's not cos they've got a pipes problem upstairs. Even the ceiling has its own wallpaper. It's loud and big and extremely buzzy. \u00a0Large works of art by renowned artists. They've gone to town here. Berkeley Sq pizazz. Hoards of people quaff champagne at the bar and there are a smattering of well known types.To the left of me Judge Rinder. Wide berth. To the right, James De Gale. Deffo worth a handshake when you're drunk and happy. I slide over and take my tablecloth with me. Mayhem. Crash bang wallop. Glass everywhere. He took it well, and the staff were there to clean up with military precision. Slick operation. But part of why you go to a restaurant has to be the food, and this is something of a let down.It's not often you go to a nice restaurant and have a dish you positively don't like. My potato and octopus skewer was horrible. Covered in some acrid nastiness which totally obliterated the poor cephalopod. I don't know what the potato was doing on the skewer but it didn't stand a chance either.Oysters were fresh and lovely and so they should be at that price. Mixed veg tempura came with a nice crisp batter as you'd expect.Madagascan prawn was delicate and tasty. But the noodles we ordered to go with it came long after we had finished the prawn dish. We quibbled. Apparently the food just comes as it's ready. So we enjoyed our bowl of noodles on their own at the end of the meal. If that's the way it really is supposed to work, it doesn't!I found the menu a little difficult to get my head round, split as it was into 'hot dishes', 'cold dishes', 'Robata' (grill I think), and 'raw dishes'. We aimlessly meandered around the menu picking bits and bobs and the end result was a rather unmemorable, bitty collection of dishes.For the black ops style sweeping up of the carnage, the visual mayhem of the place and the general pandemonium inside I give five stars. You certainly know you've been on a night out and it's a lot of fun. But I wrestle two stars back for a lacklustre meal that lacked cohesion, which peaked at nice but bottomed out at yukky.",

They should call it Sexy Duck salad, though. Then we had the foie gras gyoza which was my favourite, I loved the sauce they were in. For pudding we had the coconut and pineapple cake which was good but not as good as I had imagined, just average. All in all, it was a great experience.

My girlfriend was offended . I mean if you don't like dealing with people just don't work darling ... the black code wasn't the best I had tried. I think this shouldn't be considered a must try sushi in London like nooooo rocka zuma Nobu serve way better food.",

    "text": "This restaurant is for those who want to be seen rather than eat good food. Love the booking tactic of we only have early or super late bookings because they have to let everyone think the restaurant is packed, it isn't the case.No dish was even close to Nobu, let alone Zuma. So on the bill a cover charge, not sure what for but ok.There were only two warm sake choices, we started with one however it tasted rather watered down, we ordered a second of the same, hoping that it was a one off error, it wasn't. Ordered the other sake, same watered down taste.Every item we had, if there was no sauce, the tastes were bland and unseasoned, if there was a sauce, the taste was so overpowering that, you only tasted the sauce.Started with kingfish sashimi, sauce on it, couldn't taste the fish, poor.Seared tuna, fine but sauce again, no other taste.Beef and foie gras gyoza, wow this was bad, what foie gras, all you tasted was the excessive amount of liquid sauce they sat in with a little bit of dough. TerriblePrawn tempura, average, same quality of itsu. Has the chef ever had the tempura at zuma, i doubt it.Salt and pepper squid, no salt, no pepper, just fried chewy calamari in a basic batter, itsu is better, so is hakkasan.Chicken wings on skewer, fine if you added plenty of salt and lime, that said in comparison to Zuma, not even close. Zuma serves small, much more delicate wings which are very tasty, these were huge wings, perhaps you'd find them at a fried chicken shop.Two of the worst dishes that we didnt even eat, they ultimately took them off the bill. Pork skewers, huge chunks of dry disgusting pork with no taste. Duck salad, was a disgrace, note for the chef, try it at Hakkasan or Yautcha, you have something to learn. The duck was so dry and chewy. Inedible.Chilean sea bass was good. NY Strip steak, asked for medium rare, was tasty but overcooked, needed seasoning. Overpowering taste of charcoal.So all in all a terrible restaurant, especially compared to others. Sell some artwork, and hire a proper chef! I guess as long as the restaurant remains the place to be, people will go but will ever be on par with the quality and tastes of Zuma, i doubt it.",

However, for the price, I have experienced better. The service was alright, our main server only took our order once then disappeared for the night. He had assistants just serve us and no one came to check up on our table. The food was mediocre, definitely not worth the price I was paying for. However, the Baked King Crab leg was the best dish out of the ones I ordered at Sexy Fish and would order again if I were to revisit.However, I will not be visiting Sexy Fish again, not because the food was bad, but because the service was not up to par. The main server never informed us about last call. When we attempted to order more food he gave us a rude look and attitude despite of his mistake. Though management removed some dishes from our bill, I still will not be visiting again.",
