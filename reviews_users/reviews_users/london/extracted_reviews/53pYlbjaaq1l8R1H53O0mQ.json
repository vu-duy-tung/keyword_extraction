    "text": "The latest of the Draft House venues, and while I haven't been to either of the other two, I'm guessing the formula is the same.A great focus on beer with over 20 taps of local and international beers. The bottle range is also extensive with German and Belgian brews, as well as a solid range of US micros. I was happy to find the local Kernel beers in the fridge too. It is on the pricey side for beers but compared with other beer bars around the city it's all relative.I didn't try the food so can't comment on that but it does seem popular with the after work diners.To sum up it's worth a look if you're with friends and wanting something different beer wise than the many run of the mill pubs in the area.",

    "text": "for full review and pictures please visit my bloghungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  I was so excited to learn that a new, decently priced gastro pub had opened South of Tower Bridge, about 10 min from where I live. And I was even more pleased when I read the review by Jay Rayner who really liked the food there. Now I finally made it to The Draft House and I have to disagree with good old Jay as I found the whole experience rather disappointing. The Draft House is part of a tiny chain (with 2 more pubs, one in Battersea and the other in Clapham) and, as the name promises, it specializes on beer. My beer drinking years are long gone, not because I don't like beer but because merely looking at it gives me the worst hangover. Maybe that's why the Draft House and I were off to a bad start? The menu is definitely appealing and there were a lot of things that I wanted to order. We settled for one of the 'Pots': Smoked Mackerel with Chutney & Sourdough (4.75). The mackerel pate was rather nice and so was the chutney. However, mackerel and chutney together were plainly wrong. My taste buds always expected meat pate and then there was fish. So they were confused and not convinced. Would have been much nicer with just some lemon or horseradish sauce. The bread was good though. As a second starter something healthy: the Honey Roast Parsnip, Broccoli, Cherry Tomatoes, Watercress & Pine Nuts (6.25) was clearly not the most spectacular of all dishes but very decent for a salad with a sweet balsamic honey dressing and lovely parsnips. It went downwards with the mains. The waiter told us that their restaurant is 'getting famous for their burgers'. After I sampled their Burger (+smoked cheddar) (9.90) I would doubt this statement. It was well-priced and a generous portion, no doubt about this, but tastewise it did not convince as the bun was dry and so was the meat. If you are in the area and looking for a nice burger, I recommend the King's Arms just around the corner. Up until this moment the food was, even though without major highlight, relatively decent. The Fish of the Day, Celeriac, Curly Kale (12.75) however was a disaster. The cod was overcooked, the curly kale extremely salty and everything was swimming in oil. To be fair, it said it came with Sauce Vierge which is an olive oil based sauce but nevertheless I am sure that this is not supposed to taste like this? I really wanted to like the Draft House. This modern gastro-pub has a rather pleasant atmosphere, the staff was lovely and I really could have seen myself hanging out there a lot. However, I don't think I need to repeat this culinary experience",

    "text": "What a difference a year has made to the Draft House. We turned up on the Monday before Christmas at 7pm for dinner to find the place pretty much deserted and very low on atmosphere. No worries on that account as we were 10 strong and had brought plenty of the festive spirit with us. We had the same table in the back room where we had sat a year previously and, other than the strange lack of folk, things seemed to be set fair for an evening of good food and drink. Unfortunately this was not to be the case as the food offering at the Draft House has gone rapidly downhill over the course of the last year. This may account for the lack of punters at what should be the busiest, buzziest time of the year. Starters where bland at best and pretty dreadful at worst; with special mention of the soup in the latter category. Moving onto the mains saw no improvement; my beef had certainly been slow cooked but was dry and tough while the salmon had been very badly overdone. It was a relief to get to the dessert course with the end now in sight but there was still no respite from the dreadful food; my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e had a nasty eggy flavour and a strange consistency while the cheese election was just plain disappointing. On the upside the staff were very nice and friendly and the beer selection from the cask, keg and bottle was pretty decent. All things considered this was a big let down when compared to our experience at the Draft House the previous year and the overwhelming consensus amongst my companions was that its time had well and truly been and gone. Looks like the nearby Dean Swift could be getting our business next year .. Went here a couple of weeks before Christmas with a bunch of the guys for dinner and a few choice beers. Despite my reservations about venturing out for food in these types of settings at this time of year I was more than pleasantly surprised. Yes it was absolutely packed and yes the service was a little slow but other than these minor gripes it was good news all round and I will definitely be giving the Draft House a return visit in the New Year to sample the fine beer selection once again. We sat in the back area of the bar which was marginally quieter than the front area but was still pretty lively; a good spot if you are with a large crowd. We had reserved our table a few weeks beforehand to ensure we could be accommodated and we had been warned that it would be very busy and that turning up on time was essential if we wanted to get fed at a reasonable hour. For once we all managed to comply. Food wise I was very pleased with my selection from the Christmas set menu. My starter of Arbroath salmon ballotine was a big slab of very tasty, moist, well flavoured fish. The main of goose with all the trimmings was well cooked and presented, with a selection of meat from across the bird. The vegetables still had a little bit of bite and a good flavour which was a minor miracle given the number of covers they were serving on this evening. This was all washed down with a couple of pints of the Wandle ale and a Porterhouse Red. I finished off with a plate of three artisan cheeses and some chutney accompanied by a bottle of the Yeti Imperial Stout, an inspired marriage if I say so myself. Despite having a focus on the beer, well it is called the Draft House, there was a decent choice of wine and our sparkling expert, Ms Pattison, was very enthusiastic about the Prosecco. Even on a busy night the staff were all very friendly, helpful and only to happy to make recommendations on what would work well with your food choice. The 3 course set menu was \u00a322.50 which I thought was pretty good value considering the venue, the time of year and the quality of the food; our very varied party, who can be quick to complain, all declared themselves well pleased with their dinner and a return visit is already on the cards.",

This was the first time i have eaten however. Perhaps stupidly i tried to opt for something healthy, so chose the vietnamese Salad with chicken (though i could barely find any chicken in there). This was one of the worst meals i have paid for in a long, long time. As i stipulated earlier, i paid a \u00a32 premium for chicken. The chicken was shredded. Very shredded. So much so that the largest bit of chicken i managed to find after a lot of salad excavation was the approximate size of an anorexic house fly. The sum total of the chicken amounted to possibly less than 1 chicken wing. As for the rest of the salad, it wasnt so much a salad as it was a mountain of bean sprouts, with a few lumps of cucumber and some lettuce leaves. Not having some sort of bean-sprouts fetish i wasnt particularly impressed. In the end i left over half of it since the foraging for chicken was turning out to be a negative return - burning more calories than i was ultimately ingesting.That being said, one of party said his chicken burger was good, and the rest of them seemed to be happy with their choices...so perhaps it was just a chronic case of poor-ordering.",

On my recent visit I enjoyed a few different beers all suggested by my server or paired especially with my food. Liquid highlights included a draft pulled Meteor Seasonal (from a family-run brewery in France founded in 1640, apple toned without coming across as fruity), a bottle of well balanced Goose Island Honker Ale (an English Ale via Chicago) and the locally brewed cask ale, Sambrook's Wandle. Most beers are priced around \u00a34 for a pint or bottle (but half and even third pint drafts are available). The food menu here is tastier and more inventive than at most pubs, though some work on presentation of dishes might be in order. Venison and hazelnut cabbage with pear was certainly delish, ample and seasonally agreeable but not the prettiest assemblage I'd ever seen on a plate. Beer battered East Coast haddock with minted peas, chips and tartar sauce looked and tasted as it should have and was particularly massive. Forgoing dessert, a chocolaty Westmalle Dubbel rounded the meal out nicely.",

(apparently rotate their taps every few days). \u00a0In fairness, however, the service was very good and staff made you feel welcome.The menu was american diner style so I got the monster dog and the wife got the Korea town chicken. \u00a0The hot dog was huge and came with either hand-cut chips or fries, however, it was a quite bland and the chips under cooked. \u00a0The wife's chicken on the other hand, although looking a quite unappetising, was very juicy and tasty. \u00a0Mixed results all around, however in fairness, the waitress did mention earlier they are know for their burgers and fish and chips.i would go back to this bar, but not for dinner. \u00a0The beer list is fantastic, and along with the dean swift bar around the corner...this corner of london is a hot spot for the amber nectar.",

The bar is quite big and spacious that's perfect for having huge groups of friends, but there are little tables if you're with one other person, which is where we sat. It's great when the sun's out because the sunlight pours through the big windows and right where you sit. We ordered drinks and three appetisers: fried wings, nachos and cajun fries. They came in huge portions so if you're looking for just a light meal, don't order too much! The fried wings were definitely my favourite... crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. The whole thing was covered in buttery bread crumbs, which I've never had before. Absolutely addicting. The nachos were great as well, just enough stuff on top so there was no chips left behind. The fries were covered with cajun powder-stuff along with cajun mayo... the whole combination was phenomenal. Just the three choices left us completely full and satisfied. Felt really guilty because it was so unhealthy but hey, that's what weekend gluttony is for. So if you're down for a fattening experience with a bunch of friends, this is a great place to indulge :)",

We had fish and chips, which was definitely well done (not as well as Poppies, but definitely something I'd like to eat again) but I'd look over burgers next time, they seemed incredibly tasty (and massive!), probably on the bargain monday!Come here, drink beer, enjoy the place!",

First of all the place has a pretty nice design and feel to it. Despite being some sort of chain it does have a somewhat genuine feel to it.Staff were friendly and quickly had us seated at a table. The places is fairly good for watching some sports on TV as well although the TVs are not optimally placed to be able to watch from all the seats.Prices here decent, Mondays are a bargain with any burger and pint for \u00a39.75 but otherwise the burgers and rest of the dishes as well are competitively priced. The beers are neither expensive nor cheap and the selection is really good, at least in theory - the two first items I tried to order were sold out so not sure it is a coincidence but they managed to find a decent substitute.The burger was pretty decent, not really cooked as requested (had asked for medium rare but this was a bit more than medium) but still tasty. The french fries are actually great, not normally a huge fan but these were great. Otherwise the service tended to get slower and slower the more people showed up, understandable but they could have been one more person working. Now had to wait 10 minutes for a drink, 5 minutes for cutlery, 10 minutes to pay so was a bit annoying but still like the place with so many beers on tap, good food at decent prices and friendly atmosphere.",

    "text": "Well placed for the passing tourist trade, just south as it is of Tower Bridge, the Draft House remains refreshingly local and (from what I've seen) is never overwhelmingly busy. This is probably due, actually, to its location. It's not an obvious choice as a drinking establishment for tourists, since there aren't any hotels in the immediate vicinity. And it doesn't draw a huge after-work crowd, since Shad Thames isn't particularly known for its office buildings and it isn't immediately near any underground stations. Therefore, yes, it's mostly a hangout for those who live in Shad Thames. And not just Shad Thamers, but those Shad Thamers who aren't keen on the posh riverside eating/drinking establishments.So what I'm saying is, the vibe - it's cool.More importantly, the beer - it's good. 20-something beers on tap, 4 ales, 2 ciders and even more bottled options. If you can't find something here that you like to drink, you may as well give up on life now. Because I imagine your life is a dark hole of straight-laced misery and despair.And, finally, the food. While a bit on the pedestrian side, it certainly didn't disappoint. And the very American-style service you'll receive (table-service, actually getting you stuff you ask for, checking back on you, explaining drink and food menus, etc) makes up for anything the food may be lacking, certainly.I'm well impressed by the Draft House. The fact that I live 3 minutes' walk away, well, that probably helps too. But even if I didn't, I'd travel for the beer selection.Oh, and it has a brunch menu at the weekend. Bonus points.",

The Draft House did not disappoint.There beer selecting is amazing and already the best reason to visit. Several British, German and Belgian beers on draft and on bottle. I had a pint of Brugze Zot blonde and a pint of the Helle Weisse. We took some \"healthy\" finger-foot to go with it and ended up with a portion of fries,tacos and deep-fried chicken wings. Normally tacos in a pub are quite poor of quality as if they've been microwaved, but these were really good! The tomato salsa came with beans on top and some sauces on the side. But definitely the best item we ordered were the chicken-wings! Fried to perfection with some bbq-sauce on the side, these were crunchy on the outside and tender white chicken meat on the inside; well done! We even weren't that hungry but devoured everything. The service was extremely friendly and helpful. I definitely go back, since I didn't even had the chance to try one of their burgers or special hot-dogs!",

    "text": "Note: Thought I'd try something new and write a review as it happened. Normally this would never be the case, but since I've been to Draft House Tower Bridge several times before, I feel that I can represent this place properly.To start off, Mondays are excellent days for a bit of dinner and a pint at the Draft House. Why? Because they have an excellent burger Monday deal. You get any burger, chips, and a pint of house lager or Aspall cider for just under \u00a39.75. How cool is that?The waitstaff are very friendly with one girl running the tables while looking as if she's just stepped out of a J Crew catalogue. I'm not quite sure how that matches with the general theme, but she makes it work. Now the big question, will they let me play a Drink Deck card in conjunction with the burger Monday offer?Yep, they will! Although you will need to order at least one more item as two burger Monday deals will leave you just shy by 50p. However, with the incredible range of beers and ales available on tap, in a cask, and bottled, the only problem you will have is making a choice (ask you server to recommend based on your tastes, they are usually quite knowledgeable).Food-wise, the burgers are interesting but with massive patties (we're talking almost 2 inches/7cm thick here) which leaves them a bit dry for the most part. I'd highly recommend ordering it medium rare rather than the standard medium to preserve some of the juices. The Yolk (burger with a fried egg on top) seems to be the most popular although I found the glazed hollandaise sauce to be far to rich for even my decandent tastes. The \"Smoke\" could do with a bit more smokiness (add bbq sauce please!). The chips and fries are both excellent with crisp skins and fluffy soft cores and the bun is toasted which adds a nice bit of crunch.Beers are of course excellent. The Draft House lager is slightly sweet and very refreshing. I also tried a Coopers Stout which was rich, slightly bitter, and had strong notes of dark chocolate. Excellent stout all around and it made me wish I had space for that chocolate brownie and ice cream I saw on the menu. Overall, a great place for a drink (be careful though, some of those beers range up to 10.0% abv), and a decent place for a bite. It's hard to beat the value especially when you play your Drink Deck Card!",

Like its sister Draft Houses in Battersea, Clapham and Dulwich, the Draft House here offers somewhere between 50-100 beers. Beer lovers won't find truly exotic stuff, but it's still an impressive range comfortably better than the vast majority of London's pubs.The food, centered around burgers and steaks, is less convincing. I've had disappointing results when ordering burgers (they offer three: the 'Yoke', 'Toke' and 'Smoke') at other Draft houses cooked at medium, so here I opted to have a 'Yoke' well-done and the result was disappointing once more. So it's back to the drawing board.The acoustics at the large table we were at were also poor, making it difficult to hear each other sometimes. Service was a bit so-so too: it took me 5-10 minutes to get a drink when I arrived.Still, the combination of an unusually good range of beer AND (take note, Euston Tap) plenty of seating makes this a solid bet despite its failings. Definitely worth popping in for a decent beer if in the area.",

Not exactly proactive with help, and cleanliness doesn't seem to be a high priority here, but then, it's a pub, even though it's a chain pub. Location was convenient for the Tower Bridge.",

My boyfriend didn't eat all of his food, so I'm not sure that he was too impressed. I found the restaurant to be clean and the bathroom was located downstairs (odd). I'd recommend coming here since it is close to The Tower Bridge and you can easily get to the restaurant before or after your tour of the bridge. Cheers.",

I'm not sure if it's normal in other countries to ask how your burgers are done but they didn't. Surprisingly, it came out perfectly cooked (medium to medium well), which is the way I like it. If you like your burger cooked differently, you probably would have to specifically tell them.They have a large variety of beers you could pick from which was nice. They also carry beers that are known around the world (although I recommend getting local beer). I'm pretty sure they brew their own beers, too. It wasn't packed when we got there but there are two areas where you could sit. There's a dining area behind the bar so if you want to just eat without being tempted by beers around you, they have an area for that.Overall, the place is very casual and it's a nice pub to meet at for a casual drink after work.",

It is the 3rd-4th restaurant you see once you cross the tower bridge and as I found out, I would not be disappointed. They have about 20-25 beers on tap and after have 3 full glasses and about 8 taste, I can say that there all top of the line.For food I had a couple of things. First I had a starter and my choice of a boat load of wings (the container is shaped that of a boat.). The wings were basically baked and the sauce was like a frank hot sauce glaze. They gave you about 14-16 and the wings were great, the best wings I had in the city of London. For my meal I went with a bratwurst with sauerkraut( pretty good, however mustard in London is either the Dijon or the hot mustard and i learned the hard way) and a boatload of Cajun fries, which to were really good. Overall I am really glad I ran into this place and yes I would/will come back.",

It's a really great spot - music is good and isn't too loud. The decor is cool and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. The cocktail menu is very unique and was quite intriguing, such as the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test where you pour in the citric acid and lick a battery to change the drink's flavour, or the savoury ingredients (blue cheese?!) included in some other drinks. They all tasted great and we had a great evening.Only 2 things I could possibly say as negative is that 1) our night would have been way more expensive without the voucher (but that's London for you so I suppose that doesn't count) and 2) it was just not that busy at all, leaving the place feeling a bit lack luster. We thought it was such a shame as this place definitely deserves to be popular! It's still a relatively new place so I hope it picks up soon.",
