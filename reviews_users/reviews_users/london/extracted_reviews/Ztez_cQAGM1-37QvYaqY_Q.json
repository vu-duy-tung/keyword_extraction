The place is gigantic, spanning several floors (at least two, and as I recall there was a dingy basement section somewhere as well) and with a bewildering number of different rooms. And every single centimeter is taken up with writhing sweaty human flesh, constantly moving in search for easy prey, it's like a human conveyor belt. Standing on top of the big staircase overlooking the ground floor you get a good overview of the bustling activity down below, it's like watching ants on an anthill. This place is a mecca for anyone interested in observing the more primitive variants of human mating rituals. With a voice-over by David Attenborough it would have been perfect. Fascinating at first, yes, but a few hours of this is enough to turn any sane person into an ardent misanthrope. Oh, and watch out for the pelvis grinders \u00a0men who grind their pelvis against you by way of introducing themselves. Call me old-fashioned, but what's wrong with just saying hello?",

You can get lost quite easily in this place and the cues for the locker room are a nightmare. You waste half your night standing in a line down the stairs.

Once in, I spent about half an hour amid a huge mass of people in what they called the line for the cloakroom. The club was quite big, with quite a few rooms, although they all seemed to be playing the same kind of commercial music, although maybe this was because it was student night. The crowd was mostly students, given that it was a student night, and they all ranged from drunk to very drunk.The only good thing about this place is that the drinks were very cheap - \u00a32.50 for a double vodka redbull, with actual redbull, not any cheap knockoffs. Also, as there were quite a few bars in the place, the queue to get a drink wasn't that long. It was an interesting night out at Tiger Tiger but I don't think that I would be going back there anytime soon.",

    "text": "Tiger Tiger is one of those places that I never plan to go to but always seem to end up here. Tiger Tiger used to be somewhere that we'd always walk past on our way to a club, but one day something changed, we ventured in and surprisingly had a really great time. Last year Tiger Tiger saw most of me and the girls' drunken moments. It's particularly ideal for me and my very loyal drinking partner in crime to go here, we both live either sides of London so it makes sense that we meet at this central drinking place. And every time we do we tell ourselves that we'll catch the last train home, but how easy is that to do when you know that Tiger Tiger doesn't close till three in the morning? Well, me and my friend could verify that it is in fact impossible. A night that was initially intended to be a quick drink ends up being a night of clubbing, meeting loads of cool people and getting incredibly drunk \u00a0I love this! In fact, Tiger Tiger's utmost appeal to me is it's bar like mentality, but ultimately is a club in disguise! The venue is absolutely huge with secret staircases, private rooms and restaurants dotted about the club, it also has two floors and two bars; To me this sounds like a night club, however if you arrive before nine you don't have to pay to get in, there is no queuing involved, you don't need to contact a promoter to get on a guest list and it is literally a hassle free way of going out and having an eventful night. Tiger Tiger's music is a bit kind of all over the place, one minute your dancing to Britney Spears, the next minute you know you're electric sliding to Earth Wind and Fire. But I don't mind this, as long as the DJ throws in a Funky House track I'm good to go. Tiger Tiger is by far the most friendliest place I've ever been to, I remember me and my friend were here one summer night when a girl initiated a conversation with me solely based on the fact that she loved the Spice Girls! I'm not sure how pleased I was about this, but the point is everybody here is so friendly and I've met such a huge range of people here. I can guarantee that most nights I end practicing my Spanish or Italian skills, playing guess the accent with South Africans or comparing British and American culture with Americans. Tiger Tiger is so mixed and I love it!Tiger Tiger, although having club like antics is as much a good place to dance as it is to have a chat, get some food and relax. Me and my friend always arrive in time for happy hour, where we get in enough bottles of wine to suffice us for a few hours along with some Nacho's and chicken burgers! Happy hour finishes at seven thirty and which explains why we always arrange to meet at seven fifteen.Sadly my partner in crime is fed up of Tiger Tiger and whilst trying to pick our new hang out I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms, nevertheless you should go and get hooked!",

    "text": "There was a time when I was 18, thought I was the coolest kid ever with my fake ID, and was told by a hotel concierge that Tiger Tiger would be an awesome party spot in Piccadilly Circus to dance with a younger crowd. The concierge had been pretty spot-on about places to go and things to do, so I trusted his judgment. Naturally, I HAD to go! My friends and I arrived early enough to avoid the cover charge and meandered around the first floor. It was all old, used up, 50-something year old guys. Which is great if that's your thing. Maybe it was Old Timer's Night, who knows. These guys were speaking about university life in the 1960s and JFK's assassination, which would make them older than my dad. Maybe it was a fluke, my group thought, so we headed upstairs. Same story, different floor apparently. No one was dancing either, just sort of standing around or bobbing their heads to remixes of Top 40 songs. It was really quite a disappointing scene based on all of the hype, but over the years, I've come to learn that most of Piccadilly is that way (and overpriced).",

Drinks easily accessible at a multitude of bars, loud music on 6 dance floors, balloons and champagne at midnight, and overall drunken debauchery made Tiger Tiger completely tolerable.

Once you walk in and get your first drink, walk on up the stairs and check out the 3 different bars/clubs up there, each with it's own feel. The crowd was pretty good for a rainy evening and the drinks are really cheap during happy hour. The staff was very friendly and always ready to take your order at the bar downstairs. I'll definitely be back.",

I will say this about drinking in the UK: it's better than the states because (I think) there are less preservatives or whatever, so you can literally drink until you drop and not get hungover.

There are three floors: downstairs tends to be very crowded, but upstairs is usually more relaxed if you're not in the mood for a crowded dance floor. None of it could be described as chilled out, though. There are rooms (or sections of rooms) you can book for private parties: I've been to a couple of these and it works well. You can order food well into the evening. The vibe is fairly friendly and inclusive. However, its location means it gets a lot of tourists, and its size means that it gets its fair share of jerks and loud-mouthed groups.",

The music played is typical music you hear on the radio. Drinks are actually cheaper here than at LA clubs I've been to (cocktails are \u00a33-4 vs. about \u00a37 in LA). I've read the other reviews and I definitely agree that they weren't that strong.There definitely is a chav crowd here - one of our guys almost got into a fight with one.Overall, my experience here was memorable, only if it was my one clubbing experience in London and I got to be among young Brits.

Cover charges vary, but are nonsense ... tbh they'd make far more money off me with an exit fee - ransoming my freedom to get out of this hellhole. Cost of drinks is borderline extortionate. The prices get ratcheted even further by shots-girls. Complete rip-off.The venue is awful: vast characterless spaces; poorly ventilated; crap decor; overcrowded.The people ... good god the people. The only people who you'll find here, besides the poor souls who'd rather be anywhere else, are clueless tourists, Essex girls dressed up to the nines who consider this a classy London night out, scumbag dodgy bankers with more money than taste who want to pick up aforementioned gold-digging slappers who will be impressed by their wide-boy attitudes (if not their invariably tiny penis), students and under-age drinkers who can't get in anywhere else.Please for the love of Christ avoid it.

How's that for stigma? Chain clubs like this, Oceana, Liquid etc all fall prey to same thing. Rather than a group of friends go for a sociable drink, they get a prepubescent horde of kids getting absolutely shit faced.After 10 mins of being there I wanted to punch almost everyone in there aside from the barmen and the bouncers amusingly. They all seemed so dizzyingly confused by the abundance of Joop, fake tan and Peroxide it makes them quite endearing. In my latest years I've grown an awareness of my own personal space and I just want to lash out at everyone who comes within range.

Lots of random, past-middle aged men gawking at girls, looking like their wives were wondering where they were at.I don't drink so I'm not sure of the beverage prices but all my friends said their mojitos didn't break the bank. Upstairs is a more relaxed atmosphere than downstairs; I recommend going up there first and grabbing a drink then heading down to the dance floor to boogie. They have an odd selection of tunes.

Our dinner was more or less a reflection of this, and was not the best concoction flavors; but then again, I was a So-Cal girl in London with a palate use to fatty Mexican food and super size value meals, so I may not be the best critic of British cuisine. The club itself, however, was fun and the drinks were well made, but too expensive for the small amount of alcohol mixed in. The music was surprisingly danceable (sic), and everyone was dancing, unlike American clubs where the guys stand against the wall and the girls dance in circle formations. Overall, the atmosphere was really positive and full of energy. I do have to say though, the heater was on and the dance area became extremely hot and uncomfortable. It is fair to say I wouldn't mind giving this place another go the next time I'm in London.",

We got in free since one of his friends had passes, and didn't have any problems while at the door.At a place like this, naturally my first instinct is to head straight to the bar so I can forget the fact that I'm in a place like this. It's fulfilled with tacky decor, and \"chavs\" as I'm told they're called here. Let's just say it's not the classiest of places despite its desperate attempts to portray that image. I'm confident that the cast of Jersey Shore would LOVE it here.The bartenders are rude and the drinks are way overpriced especially considering the fact that you could barely taste the alcohol in them. I tried multiple times to get a draft beer, but was told there were no clean glasses (so clean one!) The line to the bathroom was ridiculous and it took about 30 minutes to actually get there to use it. When kicked out at the end, I asked a bouncer if I could use the bathroom since I did just pay them a shit ton of money for their poor drinks and he said \"I should've gone wee when I had the bloody chance.\" ugh. Despite all of my negativity towards Tiger Tiger, I had a lot of fun! This place is totally out of my comfort zone, but my American accent attracted a lot of interesting Brits (not just chavs!) 2 stars are given to the people I met, and none are given to the club itself.",

And we still had to pay \u00a32 for coat check. On top of that, I lost \u00a310 somewhere between paying at the door and giving coat check my coat.Money issues aside, the club still sucked. My friend booked the VIP room for her birthday party, but the bouncer wouldn't let me in because I didn't get a wristband, not even after she personally asked him to. While she went off in search of more wristbands, me and the three girls I went with wandered over to the bar. The place was packed with obnoxious foreigners, unattractive men, and pretentious 16 year old girls teetering on five-inch heels. The music wasn't bad (I like top 40s pop, okay?), but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the night. Then again, I might just be bitter about the whole thing because three boys showed up and dragged my friends away, leaving me to go home alone. Regardless, I wouldn't go back again.",

I had always heard bad things about this place which slightly put me off but as I was attending a hen night I didn't have a choice so came here. I was not impressed at all. I'm not a fan of clubbing anymore but on the odd nights out I have ended up going clubbing just to have a dance and carry on enjoying myself with the group I was with. I definitely would not come back here as I found it horrible and it reminded me of student nights out where the floors are sticky, takes ages to get served, all the guys who are here are just trying to pull for the night and it is not my thing.

The first time There weren't any people, it was literally just our group upstairs.Yesterday I visited tiger tiger for their Spanish night and if you are in to that I strongly advise you to go to Walkabout's Brazilian nights on Mondays because the atmosphere at Tiger Tiger was very very dull. They asked two pounds for entrance and then another two pounds per item you want to store kn the cloakroom which is quite ok, but as my friends and I were carrying quite a lot, we decided to just put it against the wall where we were dancing and nothing got stolen, so you could say the crowd was ok. One of the things I do find positive about this place is the fact that people of all ages (above 18 ofcourse) are dancing here.Lastly I would like to comment that the venue lookes really good and it is located very centrally but in my opinion it is not word another visit!",

It's not my scene, but mostly because of the outrageous music and other patrions that just made me feel uncomfortable.

Agreed with previous yelpers that it's a bit chavvy, a bit top40/generic but the bottom floor, the 1980s and 1990s floor is pretty good. I only say that because the ground floor and top floor was jam packed and you couldn't move without being groped (Intentionally, might i add! urgh!), the bottom floor was much more casual, less packed and far more people up for a laugh than uhm, for no better words, getting it on. Drinks were reasonable for London, didn't try cocktails, the bar on the second floor is invisible, i mean that there are no lights in the bar, but the bar men soldier on, they still do their cocktail tricks, even if nobody can make out what they're doing...",

I saw so many young women leave after just 45 mins in there because it couldn't facilitate young, classy, intelligent, and beautiful women. The place is disgusting .Several male staff members could give less of a shit about the customers. The bouncers at the front are awesome though. But once you get inside the staff literally treats you like a dollar sign and doesn't care if you have a good time (trust me they treat everyone like an animal and keep trying to get you to spend more money and get more intoxicated. Don't get me started on the music. It's the same \u00a0playlist every night( for a fact ). The music and strobes will make your ears ring and vision blurry. The place makes me sick .Don't let these pieces of shit rip you off. Last but not least I felt as though I should mention one more thing. I was calmly sitting on the black couch in the Luxe section by mysellf hitting my juul ( small e-cig) when a security guard came over to me and told me to stop( which I did). He then signaled over two more security guards who escorted through a back exit to the front of the venue and said they would talk to the manager about me using my e cig and if the manager would let me back inside. I was ultimately tricked. Outside I was walked over to the manager who asked me to hand over my ID which I cooperated and he then gave it to the front bouncer so he could re scan the ID and \"ban\" me. I was never given a warning or even said a word to before they decided to escort/ban me outside . I was banned for using my e-cigarette once on the couch inside. I was very cooperative and did not cause any issues in the \"club\". That should sum up the fact that this is one of the most backwards clubs in London. Do not come here if you want a good time. You will be strongly disappointed.Cheers to the manager, you dehumanized the wrong customer, buddy.",

It was a bit empty when I walked in around 1:30 but I think they get more crowded when it's late since it's suppose to be a night club too. Would recommend to others",

The DJ is very wishy-washy, mostly trash music with a few outdated hits here and there. Nice venue, and would be a lovely space to rent for a private party. \"Tiger Tuesday \" is a fad they push. The bring a group concept applies here- it would not be enjoyable with only one or two mates, but a larger group can make it into a great night. I've heard it's much more popular on the weekends.",

They have multiple dance floors, we are always switching. This place has tons of bars, which is good for getting drinks quickly. I love dancing so I don't mind this place, while my friends are okay about this place. Lots of older gentlemen though, and my girlfriends describes them as aggressive. I am giving this place three stars because they charged my mate for two double shots when we ordered singles.",

I ordered a fishfinger sandwich, which came with a little salad on the side.Not much else to say! The food was pretty good and I expected food in this area to be a bit pricier.Very chic feel inside and the servers were pretty nice. No real complaints.

We got on the guest list both times because of it being their birthdays, but I've heard there is an entry fee if not, which I wouldn't pay. The club itself is alright, there is a downstairs dining space and then an upstairs area with booths that can be reserved along with the guest list. The prices are ridiculous. I mean, I guess you'd expect them to be in central London but I took \u00a320 with me foolishly thinking that would do it, and a double vodka coke was \u00a311. Safe to say I had to pay on my card a few times!I've never had food here, but I wouldn't. When you go to the smoking area of Tiger Tiger, you have to walk through the eating area. On the occasions I have done, I've seen people sat trying to have a quiet dinner and have drunken people (like me) stumbling through. My tip would be, if you're not familiar with London and looking for somewhere to go on a big night out, try somewhere else. It's not all it's cracked up to be.",

Having drunk enough of the stuff in my life (with my granny of course, honest,), I would estimate the ratio of water that had been introduced to this was roughly in the 30% to 50%.
