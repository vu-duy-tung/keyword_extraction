A friend of mine, a Bratwurst virgin, had one too and really liked it so I guess it is safe to say that Brits will enjoy the concept of Bratwurst as much as ze Germans do.",

As long as you love the curry sauce they pour over everything (and I do), this is pretty fantastic. There's also a pretty cool automatic sausage slicing machine that we were mesmerized by. This stuff goes down particularly well after a few drinks. They've also got a case full of interesting sandwiches and pastries - we tried a black and white cookie, which is more cake-like than cookie-like, and I saw a pretzel croissant that looked interesting, though I was too full to sample it. There's a bench outside, but no other seating, so plan on standing at one of the counters to scarf down your food, or take it to go and have a wander while munching.",

The sausage is put into a machine to slice and dumped in a pile in your cardboard tray and covered in sauce. Not difficult to see it wouldn't make a good picture. The seasoning didn't seem well balanced either. My dish was extremely sour with not enough curry and/or chilli powder in it.Service was also a little slow considering how easy a dish this is to make. It should be as quick or quicker than ordering at Macdonalds. Give this a try, but if you get the chance, try Curry 36 in Berlin. Most epic.Edit: I went to another place that did Currywurst in Soho called \"The Bratwurst\". Having tried that abomination of what they called \"currywurst\" I felt I was a little harsh about Herman Ze German which was miles ahead in quailty. Added a star as a result",

The spicy sauce definitely lives up to its name and is worthwhile if you can handle a bit of heat.yes, the machine they use to dice the sausage is a little unsettling to males, simply because it conjures images of severe pain and discomfort, but it's easy to distract oneself from it by immersing oneself in the vast array of sodas or pretzels available for purchase. My only qualm is that they charge you to add sauerkraut to your meal. 50p for cabbage? C'mon, just build it into the cost of my currywurst so that I don't have to pay a 2nd time...",

All in all if I happen to hungry after a few pints I would pick a curry first, Herman ze German next and a kebab shop as a last resort. The food is not bad and the French fries were nicely spiced.",

Most importantly: CURRYWURST!I tried the currywurst with pork sausage (i.e. normal Bratwurst) and the mild sauce, with a side of fries. The sausage was cut up in slightly too big pieces for my taste, but it was very good, the sauce was just like a proper currywurst sauce needs to be.The fries/chips/pommes (whatever you will call them) however, disappointed me. They were very stale and tasteless or overcooked (crunchy, but not in a good way at all!), I ended up leaving half of them. That kind of surprised me, especially after reading the good comments about the fries in the other reviews. Maybe I just got unlucky and had a bad batch?The fact that they had Fritz Kola made me weep a little bit. Tiny piece of home! Although they were fresh out of the normal cola and instead just had some other fancy mixes (i.e. coffee cola or cherry cola, melon lemonade etc). Again, unlucky, but all the more reason to go back when they're in stock again! :DMy Canadian friend, who had German food for the first time, was quite happy as well.Staff are very friendly and German-speaking, at least the one who served me was.Definitely worth going back to, despite the fries! Next time I should try the Sauerkraut, I think. :)",

If you order in German, you get the same quality of service, by the way.If you don't know what to get, I recommend currywurst with pommes frites. It's basically chopped sausage in bbq sauce topped with curry powder with a side of fresh fries. This will cost you about \u00a34 or \u00a35.They take cards, but you have to spend at least \u00a35, otherwise you get charged extra. If that's \"a bit pricey\" for you, then you can try the McDonald's down the street.Also, if you're sick, the food here will not heal you. You're just going to have crappy food all day, no matter where you go, Lizzie. :OTake-away is pretty best, since the restaurant is tiny. Sitting at the one table, even when it's empty, is a bit uncomfortable (especially since legitimate Germans are so big). There's also a sink where you can wash your hands with.

    "text": "Popped in here on Saturday night on our way to a late-night museum showing. The staff weren't exactly friendly - when one of them informed me that there was no chilli wurst, and I asked if there was anything at all with chilli on it (my partner likes having his head blown off during every meal...), the woman on the counter got quite tetchy with me and repeated that there was NO chilliwurst (which wasn't what I was asking - as a sober London-dweller with an RP accent, I can't have been too difficult to understand, so I've no idea why she got so grumpy). After which she told me that I could put jalape\u00f1os on the dog. So there was an option after all... Not a great start!So, in the end, we both ended up with bockwursts, my partner with jalape\u00f1os, and me with crispy onions, and some fries. He really enjoyed his, and I wasn't overly impressed - it was filling, and tasty, but I didn't think it was anything particularly noteworthy in terms of German cuisine. I've had better, and worse, takeaway German sausage, in England and in Germany.Overall, nothing wrong with it. Tasty, filling, and cheap, but not a culinary experience to put off for a long time in anticipation (I've been excited to go for two years!) or you'll be disappointed, and possibly told off if you dare to hunt down jalape\u00f1os when they're out of chilliwurst...!",

Fast food prices are much higher than in the US, but for London this is a cheap eat, especially so close to Whitehall and Trafalgar Square.Noting the mixed reviews for this place, I would note that I went for lunch during a particularly busy weekday, so they were moving product. The brat was hot, the bun was fresh, and the fries were very tasty. I would imagine if you hit this place on a slow weekend, your experience may be very different.All in all, a definite repeat for a weekday lunch.

The way they are in Chicago!Herman Ze German is a small place with great food and not too much seating. So this means you get to eat standing up or cross your fingers you get a spot at the table. As an FYI its well worth it! In my opinion Herman Ze German hat sehr gut essen und nicht so teuer!I am looking forward to eating there the next time I am in London.",

    "text": "They claim that their Wurst is Ze Best... I had a bit of time to kill before heading back to work, so I thought I'd check out if Herman Ze German lived up to its expectations!I got Currywurst with chips. The wurst was good (not too greasy, good flavour), but I'm not sure I liked the curry sauce that much (it was a bit too sweet for me). The chips however were very VERY good (with loads of curry-salt)!! No matter what you do, GET THE CHIPS (and probably the free crispy onion topping too, because YOLO)!Currywurst + Pommes was \u00a35.95 I think. Rolls around \u00a35. Sounds like a great lunch deal to me!cakeandwhisky.wordpress.\u2026",

Given my German background, I'm a little insulted that this is passed as good German food.The Bratwurst itself was OK but served lukewarm. The bun was just terrible - cold, hard and too large for the size of the sausage. The Sauerkraut was tasteless. So incredibly disapointed. Fries were the \"wurst' I had in London. Small, hard and overcooked. \u00a0It's cool that they serve Fritz cola from Hamburg which I enjoy on my many trips to Hamburg. They also have local Hamburg brewed beer \"Astra\" available.Again.... I just don't get it. Very disapointed and no expectation to return.BK",

A slightly hungover me went in for some lunch and walked out a much happier person. Never seen their method of making fries before but they are tasty! I think it's a really big version of an Actify that rotates vertically instead of horizontally. What does come out is a nice crispy fry that holds sauce well.This location doesn't have much seating and what it does have is tight, being beside Charing Cross it's also quite busy.I recommend getting the Currywurst with Pommes, although I'll let you choose what sausage to get, I think they're all good.",

I only found out because it said so on a sign - there's no way you could tell from the taste.The brat was the best I've had, and I've been to Germany a few times as well as scoffed brats at a series of German Christmas markets in the uk.The cola was unusual - not a brand I'm familiar with but it was interesting with notes of burdock and pepper. I'd order it again - far better than some lukewarm fountain Coke.",

While sometimes it's lovely to have a leisurely dinner, sometimes you need to be in and out and if so, this is your place. Specialising in German sausage, it is very no frill. You choose your sausage, whether it comes with a bun, salad or chips and you're done. They have some toppings you can add such as curry sauce, onions, cheese, pickles etc which are great. The chips can also have toppings if you wish. With rotating specials there are a lot of combinations to try. As it was my first time I went with a simple bratwurst and it was really nice. It was served in a fresh, white crusty roll and topped with mustard and tomato sauce was gorgeous. Be warned - it's very filling. For a meal that topped out at \u00a310 it is tasty and impeccable value.",

(Sidenote: This was my first time trying curry sauce & the flavor is not for me. I expected it to be yellow like the curry I'm used to, but it was red like ketchup!) My wurst was ginormous, almost a foot long, I believe. I barely had room but I swiped a few of her fries, which were good & crispy. I have to admit, my stomach hated me a little in the morning.

I also got chick sandwich, was so big I couldn't finish it. The only downside is that there were no bathrooms so make sure you go before you come here. Other than that, delicious!",

    "text": "I'm half German so just happy to find a place that does things close enough to the street vendor variety I could find in my Mother's home town of Hamburg.I just feel spoilt for choice here and gosh darn it if the Wurst isn't just scrummy.I think the pricing is very reasonable for what you get and, while there is minimal communal seating, they seem to have quite a quick turnover so it's busy, buzzing but never packed.Service is really fast and friendly and YES they respond to German in German and this is a great alternative to fast food of the bland variety (not names mentioned)I kind of went for it here as I felt like a kid in a candy store or a German in a Bratwurst Store may be more apt. \u00a0I had the Wurst Deal which included a Hotdog, Fries and a drink at under a tenner. \u00a0I added a few toppings and you can customise the chilli level or type of wurst to make it your own. \u00a0The chilli certainly catches you off guard and while I didn't feel it while consuming I had a healthy glow by the end. \u00a0I did not walk away hungry that much I can assure you!They have a unique range of soft drinks that go down with ease and, within my little group of yelpers, we tasted a couple and they were very popular.Hot dogs can be a messy business so the sink to wash up is very handy.Not 100% authentic but close enough to conjure up memories of my childhood summer holidays.",

    "text": "German sausage anyone?? \u00a0Reasonably priced. Not a lot of seating but I guess thats represented in the cost of the wurst.. I went for the wurst salad combo.. And I braved it with the spicy option which at first was too spicy but the best creeps up on you and before you know your mouth is on fire??? The apple, \u00a0cheery and elderflower fizz was yummy.. I am gonna need to go back to try the other option too! And if you are a messy eater then they have catered for you with a sink to wash up.. Cause if you managed to get by with no mess, \u00a0then you need either more topping or more sauce.. Lol \u00a0they give fried onions out for free but all other additions do need to be paid for but 50p for gherkins? \u00a0I can manage that!",

    "text": "I came upon this place during a night stroll and the catchy name of this place caught my attention. German food in London? Hell yeah! I got the recommendation with Lucifer's sauce on it, aka the ringer - that sounded kind of wrong. The service was extremely nice and friendly, props to those guys who were working that night. They made my day. Back onto the food, I had no idea what to expect from this place since we barely have any German food where I live but man, the first bite was gooooood. A little bit of sauce, a little of fries, a little bit of crunchy onions, a little bit of Sauerkraut, and best of all, a little bit of sausages and BAM, I was flavor town. Then came the heat. The ringer is not for the hot sauce virgins I warn you. I totally didn't expect a habanero level of spiciness but I definitely recognized its potency. Boy was it good and what a rush it was. I wished that we had Herman ze German in Canada, I know I'd go there everyday during work.",

Love it!Edit: Came back to London after 9 months and the first thing I did was grab a bite from here.The Currywurst is mild but adding a pinch of the ringer will solve that The fries are the perfect balance of heft and flavor that make them a must try.The soda is delightful.If you can go here do so as soon as humanly possible.",
