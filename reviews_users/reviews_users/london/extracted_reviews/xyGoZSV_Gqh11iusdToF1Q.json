But hurrah I also came away with this little place in my cache. Honest to god there is little that merits it in the way of food but as a welcome alternative to the rest that is on offer in Angel, it is a positive delight. And the great thing is that unless people know about it or are introduced they are unlikely to stumble upon it. Upstairs in a somewhat run down warehouse building snuck behind Angel tube, up the grotty stairs and through a door you stumble into a space that could easily be mistaken for someones rather quirky kitchen diner. Long table runs the almost the length or the room, sofas at either end and intimate cafe tables by the drafty sash windows along the side it's easy to while away hours reading, watching, drinking tea or watery, far-too-hot coffee or having a rambling ambling conversation with a dear old friend. It's a retreat from the outside world and often one i find hard to drag myself from.",

Very arty and bohemian with some naked women in the art on the walls, to give you a flavour. No one seems to mind if you spend all day here chatting and/or working. Good place for informal meetings as tends to be reasonably quiet (though there is background music)",

And really, for me, this place is all about the fantastic atmosphere, which everyone summed up already. Definitely worth dropping in whenever you're round these parts.

I got the Tortellini for \u00a37.50 pounds and it came with a salad and some sauce but it felt like I could've done it back home using one of those ready to eat Tortellini meals. Then I also got the chocolate cake which was a little dry and the icing was not very chocolatey. Nevertheless, food is good enough. And the white wine that I got was fantastic for \u00a33. 2. SERVICE - Even more fantastic than the wine. With the homey atmosphere, the servers are very relaxed and accommodating. I was even smoking with one of them outside and she was very nice. 3. AMBIANCE - I love love love it. I will definitely come here over and over again. Picture big velvet sofas, tall used candles, wooden tables and a conversational but not loud crowd. Perfect for: dates, studying, coffee + a lot of conversation with friends. I wouldn't know how it is during the day but at night, it's fabulous for all that. And it closes at 10.",

I don't know, maybe I'm not mixing in the right circles.So I came here when it was raining and I desperately needed the loo. Creeping up the staircase of what I thought was an abandon building in search of the ever elusive London toilet, I wondered into a cosy little hole. This apparently is the Candid Cafe, serving fresh homemade cakes, tasty teas and playing soft classical music throughout. You'll be served by a very rude lady and don't think about chatting or laughing loudly, this is an arts caf\u00e9, fine arts.It's the perfect spot for a bit of afternoon reading or getting around to penning that novel you've always wanted to write.

A truly godforbidden place to be seen in. Vintage meets Romanticism meets Gothic meets mediterranean and so on. Highly ecclectic there seems to be a contribution of multitalents.I enjoy drinks here usually and can spend time reading a book.

(I mean, I've only been to one womb before, but I thought it was pretty great, so why not give it another go, hey? Especially since this one promised to deliver the sweet nectars of life: coffee and wine.) After trekking down a small alley directly behind Angel tube station, then up three flights of freight stairs, I walked into my version of coffee shop heaven. Candles and cushy chairs, exposed wooden floors and large squared windows, long communal tables and small private round desks -- this babies, is a life changing communal space experience. I only had \u00a32 on me, which is lucky because it was prime cake+white wine+siesta time and Lord only knows this would have been the perfect spot to indulge. However I responsibly spent \u00a31.50 on an Americano, and went on with me day, leaving my heart and tummy to lust for the day I return. . .Which will most likely be tomorrow. And maybe the next day.",

At night the cafe is very dark and it lit by candles with wax dripping down the metal holders.To get to the menu-there are homely meals of lasagne,pies quiches,curries,stews.Expect to pay 8.00 to 12.00 pounds for a dish made earlier and reheated and served with rice or salad. The selection of coffees and cakes represent better value.As for the service the staff are a bit disorganised but not unfriendly",

To top off what the eye sees, there is classical music played at just the right volume to send you off into a blissful daydream.Unfortunately my reverie was abruptly shattered, my butt-cheeks involuntarily clenched when I heard how much they wanted for a cola and a slice of chocolate cake. \u00a35.60!?

    "text": "Tucked away behind Angel station, I never would have known this cafe existed without doing a local Yelp search of the area. \u00a0Following the signage up a rather commercial looking building, the journey into the cafe was reminiscent of finding off-the-beaten-track venues in Eastern Europe. The cafe is cozy, and staff were attentive. We found that the license is set up so that if you order alcohol you must also have food to share. The food and coffee we did try was nothing to rave about but if you're looking for something a bit different and more relaxed that what you normally find on the high street, check this place out - bring a book or a good friend and you'll find a quieter space than most to catch up.",

    "text": "\"Where are you taking me???\", said my friend. I was taking her to Candid Cafe for our pre-theatre meal. My friend could not believe that there is a cafe on the 2nd floor. The stairs leading up to the cafe were dimly lit. When we got to the 2nd floor, there was a sign that read 'Candid Cafe. You've made it!'. We pushed open the door, it was dark and then there was another door...creepy...and we finally made it!!!We were surprised to see the actual cafe and how lively it was. The ambience was warm, the friendly staff welcomed us. I asked for the menu and the waitress told me it was on the wall. Hahaha how corny! We immediately ordered our meals and drinks. The waitress said we could sit anywhere. Most of the tables were taken or reserved. There were some cosy sofas but would not be suitable for eating our dinner. I asked a couple of women who were sitting at the long table with 'reserved' tags on the table if the seats were taken. My policy is 'if you don't ask, you don't get!'. I got us 2 seats! Apparently their guests would not be arriving until later (in an hour's time).I had the tamari salmon with rice and salad \u00a39 and mint tea \u00a31.70. I was surprised to find the salmon had its skin on! The salmon skin was crunchy while the meat was tender and juicy. The salad was fresh and light. The Greek rice pilaf was just the right taste for me. The rice had a subtle flavour of saffron but the colour was a brilliant yellow. A little goes a long way and I appreciate the effect on making a dish a brilliant yellow with a mellow flavour :)There were no lights on the ceiling, in the dining area. There were, however, lots of candles used to light the dining area. The candle lights created a dark and gothic look to the ambience. Oh, so romantic! I will definitely take my future date to this cafe, to see how he would react. Hehehehehe...",

Big wooden tables, candles, fairy lights, sofas and comfy armchairs combined with fresh flowers and art works on the walls. It's not easy to find, but you're gone be ok if you follow the half horse statue up the stairs. The food is simple, but delicious and plenty. Only ... When they say smoothie on the menu they mean Innocent smoothie. That's the only niggle. Otherwise the perfect place for a lazy afternoon, especially as the cakes were amazing. Even Grant said so!!",

The venue itself is quite eclectic and homey, without the pretentiousness of hipsters invading.I had some hot chocolate to start which was warm and welcoming. They do booze as well, but after my weekend bender I needed a bit of a break.The food is quite simple, but delicious. We started with olives and bread and some bruschetta. The bruschetta was fresh and cheesy, and the bread was garlicky and there were a ton of olives to go around. I had the roast chicken and it was cooked quite well with a side of rice and salad. There's also a good amount of vegetarian stuff on the menu, if you're that way inclined.Dessert was three different cakes we split. Very nice and not very expensive.It's definitely worth checking out.",

I like that they have a large communal table at which a bunch of people can communicate with each other; and I like that they have quite a generous outside seating area where you can enjoy some quite and piece away from the huzzle and buzzle in Angel... ...yet what I don't like about this place is that I never feel welcome. I mean, the whole caf\u00e9 is decorated in such a way that you want to feel at home and enjoy a cup of tea or a nice lunch, but somehow the staff never made me feel as if I was welcome there. As for me, I like to have a little chat, even if it's just about the wether, but the people here always seem to be too busy even when I'm the only customer.Still, if you're in the area...give this a try and who knows, maybe they're just not nice to me?",

A large but well-heated room greets you, with friendly staff serving comfortingly thick and filling food in boho surroundings with, crucially, a large window to stare out at the horribleness that you are missing outside. Ideally I would spend more than an hour in the Candid Cafe, preferably not on a day where I had to be anywhere else. There are comfortable vintage chairs to while away some quality reading time on. The coffee and soup are what I usually go for, but the sandwiches are good too. All the food looks very healthy and wholesome, in fact. Prices are correspondingly above budget-level, but it seems justified for the experience.",

    "text": "This is a great little caf\u00e9, hidden away at the top of a funky building an Angel. I've had two vastly different experiences at Candid, the first one very good and the second a bit disappointing.The first time I went to Candid I was greeted by a young and smiley waitress at the top of the stairs. She took my order and very kindly explained to me that I would need to order some food to go with my glass of wine (apparently due to licensing constraints). I found a nice spot inside and the wine arrived soon thereafter, soon to be followed by my plate of olives and bread. In short, the service was good, the staff was friendly, the food was tasty and plentiful, atmosphere was nice, etc. etc.I expected something similar the second time around, but was rather disappointed after a very strange experience. After stepping up to the counter, the waitress (not the same as the last one) took one quick look at me, didn't say a word, looked down, and continued whatever she was doing. It took the waitress a few good minutes to really recognise my presence. When she finally did take my order, I felt like she was doing me more of a favor than actually helping a customer. I ordered the exact same thing last time: a glass of red wine and the plate of olives and bread. The food arrived first but was about half the size of the same dish I had the time before, and not nearly as tasty. Another 10 to 15 minutes later the wine arrived brought by the same waitress (who almost seem to be looking at me in disdain - weird!)The difference between these two visits was like night and day. The only thing I did was dress differently. I wore casual clothes on my first visit but a suit on my second visit. I admit, I was the only person there dressed as if I had come straight from work, but is that a good enough reason to be treated so poorly?Because my first visit was so good, I'm tempted to give it one last try. I guess I had better dress down, though!",
