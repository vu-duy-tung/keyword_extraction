It feels like fine dining in a more casual environment.Thanks to 'knowing somebody, who knows somebody' I was lucky enough to get a great table at short notice and try a few different dishes for each course.Starter of lamb and sweet potato was perfection and my favourite dish of the night. The ham, eggs and peas was a close second though. Main of duck was quite rich and a much bigger serve than I was expecting making it quite good value....Feeling quite full I opted for the macaroons for dessert. They were my least favourite dish and were slightly chewy. The brioche on the other hand was amazing and was so disappointed I was too full to have more than a couple of mouthfuls! If I still lived in London I would be back for sure!",

    "text": "Woah, Berners. It's glitzy.It's glam.The bbq pulled pork is the best I've had outside of the US.The staff is beautiful.The space. Just... the space.The barmen are as gorgeous as they are talented.It just might be Jason Atherton's best restaurant to date.It's the hottest ticket in town.Need I say more? I guess I should...We managed an early evening booking Saturday night. We gawked at the room for awhile. And then finally managed to order some food. We ate a lot of the menu. There are oysters, so of course, had a few oysters and a bottle of bubbly. The apps were good, not great. The signature Ham, Eggs, and Peas was not Atherton's finest accomplishment, and the scallop ceviche was a bit bland. The mains, on the other hand, were all excellent. The halibut and the cod were both some of the best fish dishes anyone in our dining party has ever eaten. The lamb for two was excellent. My husband loved it, and he isn't really a fan of lamb. We also had to try the pulled pork, because well, we're always looking for a reason to slam a restaurant's attempt at 'good ole American cuisine.' The barbecue sauce was just the right amount of sweet. And while it wasn't quite as smokey as I like my sauce, it was a damn fine sandwich all around. I would go back just for that sandwich -- no slamming here.The desserts were a bit off. The macarons were stale and chewy. The eclair had large chunks of fruit, that were a bit of a turn off. But the chocolate-filled doughnut was a major win. It was served with ice cream -- I can't remember what flavor -- but could've been served just on its own. We had coffees and weren't rushed out at the dreaded two-hour mark, which was a wonderful addition to the very solid service. By the time we left at 8:45, the place was completely full. We would've returned to the hotel bar for a round of pool and some more brilliant cocktails, where we started the evening, but it was completely jammed with beautiful people by that point. Small flaws aside, this is a definite win for the London food scene. For most of us, the cost is probably enough to make it a night for a special occasion. And definitely book many weeks in advance! All things considered, I can't wait to go again!",

    "text": "It pains me to post such a poor review, as this restaurant is in such a magnificent venue, and generally has excellent reviews on Yelp. But, honestly, the service was abysmal! We had a 6:45 reservation on a Saturday evening in the near empty dining room. \u00a0Nonetheless,we were rushed to order everything in 20 minutes. The waiter hovered over us and asked us four times if we were ready to order food even before allowing us to finish reviewing the wine menu. \u00a0We did not order a starter, but the meal was on the table by 7:10, ahead of the bottle of wine being served. \u00a0This was a clear oversight and apologies were made about a 'busy kitchen that needed to move things along'. \u00a0Further, i suspect that the 'very busy' chef didn't spend much time on preparing what was supposed to be a 'medium-rare' burger. \u00a0It was so rare, it could have been easily mistaken for steak tar-tar! We immediately sent it back and asked for a medium, which was still extraordinarily red, but it was acceptable given the other challenges. \u00a0When we asked for ketchup, it was served in a tattered, half empty Heinz bottle with the label falling off. \u00a0Perhaps, this high end restaurant find this kind of presentation 'trendy', but after several unsuccessful taps on the bottom of the bottle, we had to send it back and asked for ketchup to be served in a small container that did not require such manual intervention. The incredible setting are a must, but try only for a drink or dessert at most.",

I think the service you receive when you are actually there is fantastic, too, **but** what makes me hesitant to rave about the place is the difficulty in booking. I was just on hold for 35 minutes without being connected, and even online booking through opentable is not straightforward. I am trying to book for a large table one month in advance, and basically there's no such an option. And after 5 pm, their booking office is closed and you can only do that evening's booking through the restaurant, if you ever get connected, that is. The system is seriously flawed ad annoying as h*ll.",

    "text": "Wowzers.This is the sort of place that has a grown man using shit words like wowzers to describe it.We walked into the dining room on a saturday night and when the Maitre d' asked for our name I just said 'wow'. She smiled. I think she's used to it.The dining room is beautiful. Lush. Striking. A 40 foot ceiling with restored original cornicing is the main attraction. Every inch of the walls covered with ornate frames and photos and paintings of all sizes. It really makes some impression. Tables are generously spaced which adds to the feeling of opulence. Waiters glide by on big wide runways leaving you to sit back and watch this slick operation in action.It's a well oiled machine. The staff have been drilled. Food comes out smartly from the kitchen which you get a tantalising glimpse into. Service manages to be both friendly and formal. Hard to achieve and a sign of confidence which the place exudes. The menu has a distinctly British theme (there's fish on Fri and roast on Sun) but there's a smattering of Paris there and a bit of New York swagger with the steaks from the charcoal grill. In fact the whole place is a mixture of the best of Paris, London and New York. Big, smart, sassy, stylish.I started with Lamb breast which I chose because my attempts to cook it have ended in fatty disaster and I wanted to see how it was done. Beautifully was the answer. It came as a sort of fried crispy cake with a bone marrow crumble. There was some cheese in there too. Strong flavours and some great texture. An absolute winner. The missus had some cured salmon which came in a thick meaty slab and was also brilliant.For main I had halibut with squid ink risotto and crispy baby squid. The last time I had halibut was at Dinner and it was an overcooked dry disappointment. This was perfect. Juicy, delicate, generous. The risotto was perfect too and the crispy squid was exactly that. The three things together made for a great dish. Nothing too complicated but perfectly executed and again, the textures really made it for me. The missus had the seabass and samphire which was also perfect, just not as perfect as mine.No room for pudding. Fine cooking but they don't mess about with the portions.However it was my birthday and they brought me out a chocolate mousse on the house. I made room by massaging the food in my stomach down to my duodenum with my fist. It's a neat trick when you're in a Mr Creosote waffer thin situation like this. The mousse was worth it..The bill wasn't minuscule obvs but we did drain a good bottle of St Aubin nicely picked out by the friendly informative sommelier and all in all for the night we had I'd say it was something of a bargain. From what our waiter told us, things are going great here. They spent a fortune on refurbing the place and it's deffo money well spent. The food is excellent and the service is slick. If you want a wow night, this is it.",

My fianc\u00e9e had the burger (named the Scottish burger, which he said was great) and I had the lamb which was so tender it felt like it was melting in my mouth.

The crispy baby squid were delicious and the texture of them nicely rounded off the dish. The Mac and Cheese was a unique dish for me that if I didn't care less about my health, would happily eat on a daily basis! Perfectly cooked with a slightly br\u00fbl\u00e9ed surface.

A glass sliding door opens to the kitchen off the side. It is truly a feast for the eyes, like being in a gallery, and the atmosphere is welcoming and fairly unpretentious considering the luxury hotel and room it is situated in.We had the main as a starter - roasted monkfish with bok choy and squid ink risotto topped with crispy baby squid. So tender, so juicy, so flavorsome it was unbelievable. For mains we shared a chateaubriand steak for two with roasted artichokes and mac and cheese with ox cheeks topped with shaved truffles. Perfectly grilled medium rare large chunks of steak, creamy mac and cheese with a beautiful mix of tender shredded ox cheek and generous shavings of truffles. Absolutely flawless.The staff do a great job of being available and attentive but non-intrusive or condescending. I had my white wine replaced immediately because I thought it was a bit too acidic. I'd go here weekly if I could.",

It feels like a chic art gallery or a photo exhibit. As you can see from pictures, this is a gorgeous restaurant. We were a party of three and had a reservation. Seated within fifteen minutes ( people watched in the lobby so it was cool) our table was a oversized booth in the corner, which gave us room to spread out and to see what others had on their plates. If you like fruity drinks, please try the orb spritz it was delicious and I recommend you have two. \u00a0The mac and cheese is a absolute must. The Crab is a little sweet so if you are anything like me and don't mix meat and sweet I would avoid that. If you like sweet +meet, my sister adored it. We also got a filet with peppercorn sauce and it was just as good as any other steakhouse. \u00a0The menu is vast and you and your guest should have no problem finding something that sounds tasty. We skipped desert. I think If I was young, hip and in London I would make this restaurant a definite stop. \u00a0I have no complaints and would go back. \u00a0Don't be a hero, make a reservation. :)",

From Maitre'd to servers to sommeliers, absolutely everything was chaotic, uncoordinated, unsmiling, and downright rude.I got the sense that this restaurant is trying to be the London version of Eleven Madison Park, with it's epic Victorian edifice with period detail and sweeping scope of service. But the service was so, incredibly, indelibly, comically far from EMP that all I could think while I was sitting there was that this was the most laughably mismatched experience between foodie exceptionalism and service fuckery that I have ever witnessed.American foodies beware .. if you expect the most lackadaisacal service experience of all time, you may be in for some excellent food in a handsome and unique UK environment.

When our food arrived we noticed that I didn't have any cutlery, or a napkin. The cutlery was sorted out straight away (but I never did get my napkin). Both dishes were very nice but we both preferred the full english at Duck & Waffle and The Wolseley and I hadn't noticed that my full english came without any beans, which would have given me a nice sauce to mop up and there wasn't an option to get any as a side.To drink I ordered a Virgin Mary (\u00a36.50), which wasn't on the menu but they were more than happy to make one up for me and Antonia went for a Flat White, which was steep at \u00a33.50 and a Raspberry, blueberry, blackberry & honey smoothie (\u00a35). All very good, especially my virgin mary which was near to perfect as I've ever had.I asked for the bill and our coats, passing the cloakroom ticket to the restaurant manager only to find it brought back to me by someone else with a question \"Is this your coat ticket?\". After replying \"Yes\" she put the ticket down on our table rather than than getting our coats. Useful. To add to the generally poor level of service the bill came with an extra \u00a320 worth of stuff on it that we didn't order and after some faffing I had to cross the items we hadn't ordered off the bill myself as the staff clearly had no idea what we'd ordered. I should have just left a side portion of sausage as the only thing we ordered... I doubt anyone would have noticed.",

Since there were no reservations available we had to walk in at 6pm right when they opened and snag a seat. Overall it was a great meal, but not a 5-star-blow-my-mind meal. Although I think the bar might have a separate yelp page and I would give the bar 5 stars. Great drinks and a very friendly bartender!We got the crispy pig head appetizer and though it had a lot of interesting flavors it isn't something I would order again. Also, the rotisserie chicken was rather dry for being so pricy and lacked any real flavor. Where the restaurant did shine, though, was the steak, the sauces (both the coq au vin for the chicken and the peppercorn for the steak), the massive french fries (more like golden delicious potato wedges), and the wine list! a 40 dollar bottle of stunning bordeaux? Don't mind if I do... drink that whole bottle right before my flight. All in all a worthwhile experience filled with good food and good service--1.5 hours well spent to end our layover in London.",

You don't even have to eat there, but can perch yourself at the bar.Hazelnut waffles, berries and cream. One of those top 5 breakfasts in London you dream about quite frankly. Needs more maple syrup I feel which I asked for. Waiter very attentive and accommodating.Liked their green smoothie though very pricey! Eggs Benedict excellent but the decor and overall vibe is a triumph.This is a must visit place. I'd suggest brunch for daytime and go for a drink (love a whiskey sour) at the bar for nighttime.",

It's dimly lit and oozes elegance and class- far from what you would expect a tavern would be. Our group came in with no reservations on a Sunday evening for drinks and we were able to sit in the lounge area near the bar. We had a cozy corner with a great view of the beautiful bar. We ordered several drinks and they were not only amazing but the presentation of some were equally amazing. My drink was the aging hipster and it came served in a flask which you pour into your glass. We looked over the dessert menu and it looked intriguing so we ordered a few. The carrot cake was very different from your traditional \"cake.\" It had a more creative and innovative flair, yet the flavors were spot on. There was a mix up with one of our desserts but the waitress let us keep the dessert anyway and brought us out the right one. With regards to service, it was exceptional. We had two mix ups and the waitress was quick to fix it. I'm only rating it 4 stars because we didn't experience dinner but it just means I'll have to update it when I go back!",

I've taken out of towners who have been suitably impressed. The food has never been the draw here. Whilst the dishes are solid, they are not memorable. I was lucky enough to have dined in the private dining room at Berners Tavern as well. The room we had was not that special but it was nice to have our own space and the service was excellent. We also had a cordoned off section of the bar for drinks ahead of dinner and our guests appreciated it. Definitely go! The people watching and neighboring diners are a hoot as well.",

A DJ is spinning music in the hotel lobby just outside, the low lit cool coloured lighting adds just an accent here and there to give a very modern slant on what is essentially a classic designed room filled with floor to ceiling oil paintings and plush seating. Nothing stuffy here, but it definitely gives off a certain Englishness' to foreign visitors staying in the hotel while retaining a fresh edge.The bar is the the centerpiece with its bright lit glass shelving of showcasing every type of liquor bottle like a jewel. The bartenders are more of the mixologist types, adding just the right flair and perfect garnish to the cocktails of the professional crowd. This is an impressive place to drink, it has a lot of atmosphere and it feels like a proper night out.The restaurant has a modern continental menu filled with lots to tempt. Food was very good and the portions were hearty. While the noise factor did make it a bit difficult to talk, the vibe still lent itself to good conversation. Berners Tavern is a great place to go with friends and have a fun yet upmarket drinks and dinner. Definitely a place to check out.",

    "text": "What a Disappointment After My Last Visit!Having last dined at Berners Tavern in 2013, I was really looking forward to an evening of excellent dining in a wonderful atmosphere. Well, the atmosphere is still nice. However, the quality of the food has gone down precipitously, particularly in light of the prices (\u00a3150 per person, including wine, but not dessert).Our server was very friendly, but appeared overloaded by the number of tables he was assigned. In fact, the assistant server who brought out the plated food on trays had to wait until he could get to serving our table.Things started out nicely enough with a delicious \"Dill or No Dill\" gin-based cocktail that was herbal and crisp. However, the evening went down from there. The sommelier was \"very busy,\" as she emphatically explained when it took more than an expected time for her to provide \"advice,\" which was an upsell to a wine that required at least 45 minutes to \"open up\" in flavor. In addition, she did not notice that the decanter was chipped in two places at the lip. The starters were fine enough. I had chicken thighs with a few sprigs of Romaine lettuce, anchovies, and a slice of pancetta. It was a step up from Caesar salads served in lesser restaurants, but nothing to rave about. My partner had salmon tartare as a starter, which he described as \"good, but not great.\" I tasted it, and it was equal to the salmon starters I've had in many mid-range restaurants, certainly not a \"cut above,\" which I expect from Berners.The main courses were such a disappointment! I had the pork chop, which the server recommended as being served a bit pink in the center, which is the way I prefer. Oh, that it had been cooked thus! It was served with a sweet-ish sauce and load and loads of peas, almost to the point that it should have been listed as a pea salad with pork, rather than the other way around. The pork was tough, chewy, and not all that flavorful. My partner had the sirloin steak, which came with \"triple cooked chips,\" which were, by far, the best part of his main course. While his steak was properly cooked at medium rare, the meat itself was \"tough, but chewable,\" as he described it, and not all that flavorful. Frankly, we think that the chef needs to re-examine the meat purveyor since both our meat dishes turned out to be so tough.I was quite excited to return to Berners, remembering it as an upscale dining experience, with exquisite food. Sadly, the attention to detail and flavor seems to have disappeared in the three years since my last visit. I just won't be returning to Berners on my annual trips to the UK, sad to say, and I can no longer recommend it to friends and colleagues.",

We had a green salad to share - which, was so beautiful and fresh with big crisp leaves (may not sound like much, but salads in London - even in top places - generally leave much to be desired). For a main, I had the artichoke risotto which was absolutely delicious. My husband went for the Mac n' Cheese with oxtail which was fantastic - very rich and creamy and just exactly what you want from that sort of dish in Winter. They have a delicious assortment of 'mocktails', which are not overly sugary/sweet - great for any designated drivers or expecting ladies. Husband was very pleased with the wine selection.In short - a lovely meal in a great location - we will definitely be back again soon.",

After reading countless good reviews, I can now see what the hype is about. When you walk in the space is beautiful, a huge room with tall ceilings and every spare space on the walls is taken up with a lavish framed photograph or painting. Two extravagant chandeliers hang from the top and it really makes you feel pretty over whelmed. We had a great table, right next to the 10foot tall bar (no really) which was stocked to the brim with exclusive whiskeys, gins and vodkas. The menu for breakfast was vast, two main routes, sweet or savoury. The sweet contains gems like fresh toast, pancakes and honey covered oatmeal, and the savoury packing some serious punch with a full English, eggs of any kind and avocado on toast. Given I want nothing else before midday I was straight in with the avocado with the woman tucking into the French toast with bacon. For good measure we added some wholemeal toast and fresh jams in. Up first though, the coffees. One latte and one black, initially a strong bitter taste but then smooth and almost creamy blend, so so good.The food was soon behind, and with some excellent personal service, these amazing creations arrived. Huge portions that certainly lived up to everything I heard about this place. Soft sourdough with a peppery avocado crush sitting on top. And the size of that French toast opposite me was mind-blowing. I mean this thing you'd have to squeeze in a shoe box. The food was everything we wanted, amazing meal and made all the better with the surrounding and waiters. More than certainly be back here to give the dinner (and cocktail) menu a run but for now, if you want a high class brunch or just to splash a little wonga, throw it down here. Awesome.",

    "text": "Another great Jason's place in a posh hotel. The menu is not as creative as other Jason's place as it really tries to capture the \"tavern\" feel. Great classic dishes with Jason's touch. We missed a lunch by 5 min so ended up with pork scratching, lobster and prawn roll, hamburger - all very solid quality. The dessert was great - had rasberry pavlova - fully satisfied. The wine selection especially by glasses is poor and over priced and servicing staffs are largely young and lack classic touch but solid kitchen delivery make up for it. I see a lot of biz lunches but I personally would not use for important, senior level meeting as it may be too risky with the servicing staffs but for fun biz lunches to personal dinning, definitely a great option. I personally would pick social eating house over here.",

Incredible thought was shown to support the artistic character of the restaurant. - Foie toastie: long triangle was delivered aside my soup. It was crunchy and warm with that buttery piece of foie inside. Heavenly - Cocktails: loved my refreshing citrus drink presented with a branch of small grapes draped to the side. I like my fancy cocktails and this is up there as one of the best.- Beer: even a basic American beer served from the tap was presented in a silver knightly looking goblet- Cod: impressive perfectly crispy exterior and tender flaky interior. It was paired with a hearty piece of smoked pork belly. This gave the dish more layered flavors and was wonderful separately but overpowered the fish a bit. - Bread: both light and dark slices were warm and delicious and somehow pulled off being light and dense simultaneously- Toasted coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: unique presentation with a long rectangular piece instead of the standard round ramekin. I enjoyed the tropical flavors of the thinly sliced fruit and sorbets on either side Midlights:- Green garlic potato escargot soup: fantastic combination - Mac and cheese: loved the purity of the cheese flavoring not being too creamy and letting the thin slices of cheese on top shine, but it lacked some pizzazLowlights:- Pressure on table time: We opted to have a drink at the bar first and were bothered several times to go to our table due to the time limit. I didn't quite understand this as it was a Tuesday night and our meal took a lot less than 2 hours. Enjoyed my meal here quite a bit and would love to return for a cocktail or to try more food items in the amazing artistically all-encompassing atmosphere. .",

It was heavenly and first time I've been able to order tartare. Second I had dressed crab which was delicious. Waiter said this was a starter portion I couldn't finish. Dressed crab did not mean a lot of mayo but a delicious light kind of citrus/ herbal dressing. I also have to mention bartender agreed to make one of their signature cocktails and sub vodka for gin. I love herbal cocktails and this one made with dill did not disappoint.Bottom line everybody was happy and we had an all around great dining experience. Quality food, delicious preparation and top notch, attentive service.",

Wonderful to look at all the photos and paintings. Lovely chandeliers and beautiful high ceilings. Honestly for ambiance and decor etc I would give it 5/5.The food just fell flat. I ordered Eggs Royale and specified that I wanted my yolk less runny than normal. I appreciate that's not what a proper poached egg is but that's how I like it. However, when it arrived it was just as runny, if not runnier, than my fiance's poached egg. Even some of the white was runny which I find really off-putting I know I should have sent it back but it just feels like such waste. So I ate it but didn't really enjoy it. The hollandaise sauce was very plentiful but far too rich for my tastes - just tasted of butter - no lemon tang at all. The salmon was fine but not particularly tasty - which I would expect for \u00a314.Our buck's fizz had too much orange juice and not enough champagne/prosecco. Service was a bit better than average but not superb. Will not be returning as it's just not worth the price for the food quality.",

    "text": "After waiting for our table for almost an hour on a Friday night (and pretty late to boot, at least for this American), we finally got seated in the main dining room close to 10 PM on a Friday night. It's got a very retro vibe to it - high ceilings, chandeliers, lots of artwork of various vintages adorning virtually every open spot on the wall, save for the ceiling-high bar that holds more liquor than your average bar. Despite being a pretty large space, it was loud in Berners virtually the entire time we were there, and you don't necessarily have a ton of personal space. Nonetheless, it still has a homey, distinctly British vibe, and the ambiance is part of what brings the place alive. The service was pretty solid overall, even though I thought our waiter could have had a better handle on the menu. The beer selection is pretty meager, but the cocktail selection is pretty good (if not as extensive as Punch Room). I had a heavily dill-infused drink that was quite smooth without going overboard on the herbs. There's plenty of wine (and liquor, for sure) as well, so you can probably figure out your libation of choice easily enough.I decided to go with an appetizer and a main for the meal, and overall, the food was quite good. British food is stereotyped as being quite boring and staid, but I definitely found, at least on this trip, that if you find a good spot, it can be executed in quite excellent fashion. For the most part, Berners does this as well. I ended up going with the chicken soup to start, and to be honest, this was a bit more of the plainer food that I'm not as big a fan of when it comes to British cuisine. The broth gets poured in on top off the dry ingredients, and while it is refreshing, the broth is definitely missing salt, and the egg did not really make up for that. The server also simply served the chicken-filled bun on the side without telling me what occurred to me later - that I probably should have torn it up and put it in the soup, instead of eating it outright. That probably led to the dish being less filling and interesting than it could have been. The entree, however, was quite good. For the second dinner in a row, I went with the slow-roasted lamb, and it was very well-prepared here...succulent, juicy, and quick to fall apart. The 'vinaigrette' was a bit light for my tastes, but it was perfect as an early spring finish to the plate.I can understand the wait based on the ambiance here - it's an enjoyable place to take in a meal - and the food is quote good to boot. That said, I would definitely make a reservation ahead of time, unless you think you can get into Punch Room or are dandy taking in a drink or three from the lobby bar. There are worse ways to wait for a meal at Berners!",

    "text": "I brought my parents to Berners Tavern after reading Alex S.'s review. It's actually really difficult to pick restaurants because there are so many amazing options and you need to be careful with how many pounds you could potentially spend. Berners Tavern was my top choice because the interior seemed really beautiful and the menu did't seem to break the bank, and reviews were quite dandy. Reservations were quite tricky so you really need to book in advance if you want a good time to eat. Service, as you can expect, was very good. The appetiser I had was by far one of the best in the whole wide world- Focaccia with tomato, basil, buffalina, honey and truffle. I mean, you could taste every. single. flavour. It was SO GOOD! The combinations of all of it were amazing and I couldn't believe I was eating it! and it was all mine! MWAHAHAHAH But seriously. Now that I think of it I'd totally get three of those and be good, but I think they would have looked at me weird and I need to act like an actual adult in places like this. So anyway, the appetiser was great. I also tried my moms prawn cocktail which was very nice, and my Dad liked his chicken thigh. My main was alright- Orecchiette with mushrooms and chive. It was very simple and tasty, but nothing that totally stood out. My mom ordered the Dover Sole which they prepared IN FRONT OF US! Sorry guys, I'm not used to this kind of service... it was freaking awesome. Just the week before my husband and I went to a place in Germany and when we asked the guy the best way to get the bones out of our fish he said \"I'm not expert\". So... this was pretty awesome. He did an absolutely beautiful job. The only little issue was it was salty for my mom.. I thought it tasted very nice though (but I like salt). My dad enjoyed is steak. :) And the dessert. So, by the end of my entree I was so full. Uncomfortably full. I didn't even want to look at the dessert menu which is really unusual for me but my dad insisted so we ordered the Chocolate Tart with Mint Ice cream. That didn't even sound good to me. When they brought it out I had a little taste and WHOOSH. The feeling of fullness left me completely. For real. I sat there and thought... \"was that really in head? I could have sworn I couldn't fit anything else into my belly.. \u00a0but now I could eat two of these!\" So, that's how good the chocolate tart was. Holy guacamole it was this absolutely BEAUTIFUL tart with this lovely little bit of mint ice cream and these cookie crumbles. Every little bit of that dessert was sinfully delicious. The cookie crumbles were sweet and crunchy and amazing, and the tart. Oooooosoododododoododododododood it was so good. To the point where I can't actually use real words and have to write rubbish. :) I actually just made my review 5 stars instead of 4 for the appetiser and dessert. yay.",

Not having dined in London this was somewhat of a random search but we found Berners and wow were we blown away. \u00a0The ambiance is reverent yet had a nice vibe as well. It is fine dining so we were slightly under-dressed. \u00a0The service was on a scale only found in the finest of international dining establishments. Our waiter, Thomas never missed a beat and was tentative to our very needs. \u00a0The general manager, Will checked in with us to ensure our satisfaction was met. \u00a0We ordered steaks at our table and found them to be cooked perfect in every way - the first time. It's rare that you can find a restaurant that delivers such perfection. The staff was gracious and kind without over servings us. \u00a0Five stars !!!",

    "text": "My review is only for the bar. Saturday, 13 Feb, 4pm. It's my birthday weekend and all I've told my friend what I want to do is eat and drink all day (which we did). After a boozy, absolutely beautiful lunch at Portland, we walk into Berner's for a drink. At first we were in the hotel lobby where we sat for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. I mean, I work in a restaurant, I know it's tough, but a smile or nod would have done! Meekly I cross the lobby and politely ask the host if perhaps my friend and I could sit at the bar. Brilliantly, there was still room before the Saturday night rush. Contemplating our small victory we decided to say fuck it and order a bottle of ros\u00e9 champagne. The bartender offered us both a taste of the blanc de Blancs and the rose, admitting his preference for the blanc but my fatal flaw is my love for pink bubbles! Service at the bar was so warm and friendly... \u00a0Our glasses were never empty. They surprised me with a small treat with a candle and it completely took me off guard! One bartender even told me I could stand on the chair and tell everyone it was my birthday (maybe after a second bottle I'd have the balls). The space is beautiful and warm with paintings masterfully covering every inch of wall space. Grand chandeliers create a really grandiose atmosphere but somehow the vibe feels cozy. The bar is beautiful and extremely well designed and well stocked. There does seem to be a dress code and perhaps my friend and I were a tad underdressed (top and skirt) but on Saturdays I can't be bothered to pull on spanx and kill my feet with stilettos... Anyways you could be wearing a Sainsbury's bag while drinking champagne and still feel like a boss. A super memorable birthday experience that I won't ever forget, thank you thank you! Left with a good buzz and went off to the next spot on a very long day of being an absolute glutton! Good for: feeling posher than you probably are, birthdays (did you read my review?), late afternoon drinks",

We were in town for a long extended weekend and I wanted to have one fancy dinner out! So glad the BF looked at all the options I found and agreed we should try this one. We had a 6:30 reservation and unfortunately we were a little late because our Uber got lost several times. I did call and tell them we were going to be late. Once we finally arrived, the hostess was very kind to have held our reservation and seated us promptly. The thing I LOVED most about this place is that it had dope music playing which was a warm greeting. Prince and Steve Wonder?! I'm in! Service was impeccable, decor was opulent and food was fantastic. I hear it is one of the best places to go for Sunday brunch in London. If we ever get back to London so this fab SoHo restaurant will definitely be on the 'must do' brunch list.",

The bruschetta with tomatoes basil and mozzarella makes a great appetizer, though a little small to share for two if that's what you plan on. The burger was fantastic and the Mac and cheese is incredibly rich and flavorful. The mascarpone eclair was probably the best of all the dinner. Must try the dill+elderflower cocktail. Also we were seated almost immediately to a table by the bar, which was sublime.",

Located in the fashionable London EDITION hotel, the restaurant features a elegant but modern design with framed pictures covering all the walls.The dressed crab was delectable especially with the crab butter -- that was pure umami. It's presented in a hollowed crab shell. The shortcoming of the dish was the scarcity of toasted bread (2 slices really?!) and the over slight abundance of lettuce relative to crab but neither takes away from the creativity of the dish.The artichoke risotto was very well done and incredibly balanced. As far as vegetarian dishes go this was superb. Only criticism is this they serve it in two parts: a bowl of veggies and a pot of risotto. Why not combine the two for you? In fact I thought the server was going to do it table side in a cool presentation but I was left disappointed.The service was great and accommodating.Worth trying at least once!",

GQ wasn't lying when they called this place a work of art. Hard to not just stare at the artwork covering the walls and the intricate detailing of the ceiling for hours instead of enjoying the company of your table.Swanky atmosphere. Filled with a classy and elegant after work crowd. Luxurious booths and beautiful wooden tables. We got there for 6pm. By 7:30pm all the tables were full. Cocktails were inventive and artfully presented. At least a few of the cocktails are cross-listed with the Clocktower's cocktail list at the London Edition hotel in NYC.Crispy Moroccan lamb - almost a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e texture to the crisped outer layer of the lamb. Amazing flavors.Roasted Cornish cod - The fish was flaky and the risotto was flavorful.Flaming Alaska - not your typical baked Alaska. Chock full of crushed pistachios. The cherry sorbet itself had a slight medicinal taste to it, so I wasn't a fan. But the table side preparation of flaming the meringue coated cherry sorbet almost makes up for the taste. It's a nice little show to end your meal.",

Apart from the incredibly decor, I don't have enough superlatives to describe the food and service. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Service, from the moment you step in to the restaurant, you are made welcome. The snazzier dressed greeter was incredibly warm - none of the perfunctory \"welcome\" stuff. While our server was professional, the sommelier (Declan) was exceptional. We have a basic understanding of Italian wine. He sat with us and not only guided us to a wine, he also educated us! Super nice, super attentive - wow.And the champagne trolley! Amazing.The food... after traveling from the US we wanted some basic food. I had the filet and (trice fried) fries with peppercorn sauce. A basic dish BUT exceptional taste - my taste buds wanted to move to London. My better half had the risotto - another delicious main dish. We had breakfast the next morning and it too was exceptional.OK - I'm done raving - this place is the best you can ask for.",

    "text": "I recently visited for a work dinner. As there was a large group of us and it was a late booking, we were put in the upstairs private dining room with a set menu - good in a sense but we felt a bit let down that we weren't able to eat in the gorgeous main room. I will preface by saying that when the food came it was in good time and absolutely delicious, however before this, we were probably sat down for at least an hour before any food orders were even taken. Maybe 40-45 mins before drink orders as well. There was no bread on the table until 5 minutes before starters were served, so we were absolutely ravenous by this point. We also ended up having to serve our own wine a few times as the waiting staff were nowhere to be seen for a lot of the time before the food was served. A few of us had some changes to the set menu and they were very accommodating to this. The food was also to a very high standard and I was highly impressed with what we had. The focaccia starter (I had mine without tomatoes) was delicious but a large portion. The steaks were very good, and the mac and cheese with braised beef was one of the best meals I've tried in a long time. Very rich and decadent, and also a very large portion, so atleast the cost is reflected in the size. The desserts were beautiful and I was impressed with the taste there too. As well as wine we ordered a round of cocktails. I was appreciative that we were given recommendations on these by the serving staff, however I was less appreciative when my choices were questioned. I'd initially picked a special cocktail and was told I shouldn't have it as it was 'too sweet'. I love sweet drinks and told him as much, but he told me I shouldn't have it unless it was with dessert and picked me out another one. This isn't the worst thing ever, but i do feel like he could've respected the fact that I said I like a sweet drink instead of insisting it wasn't right for me. I would love to give Berners Tavern a five but these little things just impacted my experience. I'd like to go in a different circumstance and see if the service is better, as I think otherwise it was fantastic. I've attached some photos of the food so you can see how great it looked.",

And I was pleasantly surprised with the level of care and attention that went into every aspect of my meal. From the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by a friendly staff, who were easy to chat with and happy to indulge my in a bit of conversation before and after the meal. An army of servers ensured I was happy and well-fed, and the kitchen staff did a bang up job of preparing every one of my dishes with love. Not a single plate went back with any trace of my meal. I gobbled up every single morsel throughout the meal and would've happily unbuckled my belt and enjoyed 4 or 5 more courses. If you're in the area and looking for a complete and memorable dining experience, I can't recommend Berner's Tavern enough. From the freshly baked bread to the well-crafted desserts, I'm sure it will be easy for you to fall in love with it; much like I did.",

    "text": "I landed in London and was extremely exhausted from the flight. I just wanted to sleep. I checked into my hotel at the London Edition (which I absolutely love love love!), and was feeling peckish and wanted to pass out. The staff recommended their restaurant Berners Tavern for lunch, which is under the guidance of Michelin Starred chef Jason Atherton. They made reservations for me and I went to take a long nap in my most comfortable bed ever (the\u00a0bed reminds me of the Four Seasons). Upon arrival, the restaurant was packed. It looked like this is a common place for people to have lunch meetings. The d\u00e9cor is classic, like an old library with a bit of sophistication put to it. Photographs with beautiful\u00a0frames\u00a0line each wall\u00a0with a beautiful chandelier set in the middle of the space.\u00a0 The chairs were so comfortable. I wanted to order something small cause I knew I would be splurging and gorging on food later that evening at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. This is what I got:TRADITIONAL BRITISH PORK PIE SERVED TABLE SIDE (\u00a317.00): English Piccalilli, Pickled Vegetables, Mustard. This was just ok for me. I prefer a flaky crust. I thought it was going to be warm, but it was cold. It was more like a thick pate. The pickled vegetables were good to cut through the fat. I got a bit of all the mustards. The traditional dijon was my favorite.\u00a0TRIPLE COOKED CHIPS (\u00a35.00): I was quite disappointed with my chips. They weren't anything like Heston Blumenthal's triple cooked chips. They were a tad bit soggy.\u00a0COFFEE: It was delicious and creamy. I would order it again.\u00a0MY FAVORITE DISH. CHOCOLATE AND HAZELNUT FLAMNG ALASKA, SPECULOOS, AND COFFEE CRUMBLE, HAZELNUT CUSTARD (\u00a318.00). This dish is freakin amazing. It totally made my lunch that much better. It arrives plain and then they add an alcohol and light it on fire and pour it over the ice cream and whipped cream. It starts to flame and it brulee's the top part of the baked alaska.\u00a0Overall, Berner's Tavern was good but not amazing. It took awhile for the staff to take my order. I almost felt they ignored me since I was dining solo. The food was good, but I think I expected much more. The saving grace was the baked alaska. It was one of the best baked alaska's I've had in a really long time. Sure it's boozy, but that's the fun of it. I loved that it was also conveniently located within my hotel. Would I come back? Possibly, but I would order something else other than the pie.",

The watercress soup had a poached egg in it and wild mushrooms. No cream and it was absolutely delicious. For dinner I had the roasted Cornish cod with crispy squid \u00a0basil and tomato consomm\u00e9. Any restaurants I can make a boring fish like cod taste amazing is pretty creative. Will Try the barbecue Dingley Dell Pork-chop next time that was highly recommended. The bartender made me and amazing drink. I actually had two of them.",

The lighting, decor...every single detail is contemporary with a touch of traditional accents. The menu follows with modern takes of traditional Brit pub food. We were not a fan of the pork pie. However, let's talk about the Braised short rib mac & cheese. That dish was the highlight of our dinner. Comfort food to the next tasty level. We ordered a few hand-crafted signature cocktails yet weren't strong. Service was on point and friendly. Overall, I would recommend if looking to dine in a spectacular space.",

As soon as we stepped into the venue, I was first blown away by how beautiful the bar and decor was. Then I was impressed by the professional, polite and friendly service of the staff. I knew I was in for an incredible experience.We were quickly seated and offered a drink, wine and dinner menu. I had a dark and stormy and my sister chose something off their cocktail menu. The mixologist was spot on with balancing the flavours in our drinks. My sister never really drinks, but even she enjoyed her cocktail quite a bit. We ended up ordering the broccoli main, chicken salad, and a side of creamed spinach and mac and cheese. It was more then enough food for two hungry girls with leftovers for a midnight snack afterwards. The dishes came out rather quickly and I was in love with my chicken salad. For a girl who loves to just taste a little bit of everything, I was extremely happy that they offered the mac and cheese as a side. It's really rich and creamy! So delicious but I truly wouldn't have been able to have an entire entree's worth of it. I really wish we'd saved room for dessert because the table next to us had ordered a baked Alaska and it looked really impressive! I'd highly recommend coming in for dinner and drinks when you're in the area. I might even go as far as saying it's worth trekking out for.",

It was seasoned so well, and I was surprised as I normally don't enjoy eating raw beef. Service was top notch. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating. It was a busy night, but she made every attempt to make sure we were taken care of. Cocktails were also some of the best I've ever had. I especially enjoyed the Aromachology for it's refreshing taste. The venue is nice. It is noisy, but that is to be expected with such a popular place. Otherwise, the interior is beautiful. The bar is nice to look at, and it really looks and feels like a museum. I felt that the atmosphere was a mixture of elegance and the casualness of a regular tavern. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're looking for good English food and some creative cocktails.",

Walking into Berner's is like walking into a 17th century European salon-style gallery, with paintings hung floor-to-ceiling and on every available inch of space on the walls. I have to say, it's quite breathtaking.We didn't come to eat but rather just to enjoy a drink at the bar and take in the scenery. The cocktails here are quite unusual, and while they won't suit everyone's tastes, they will certainly introduce you to something new. First, we had a Late British Shake Off (\u00a313.50) -- a combination of gin, elderflower liqueur, Kamm & Sons (ginseng liqueur), lemon, dandelion & burdoch bitters and \"Union Jack.\" It came in a mini cocktail shaker with a straw and a British flag. Though a little hard to drink, it was a unique and refreshing drink. Then we had just a standard Pint of Beer (\u00a36.50), which came in a heavy pewter mug.The food is by Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton and looks quite promising. I hope to check out this buzzing and buzz-worthy place again the next time I'm in London.",
