It tasted ok for what it is, which is basically an overpriced gimmick (the store calls itself \"the next instagram sensation\" on their window.). I've had better egg waffles elsewhere.",

    "text": "my first (and only) tasting of the bubblewrap waffle luckily (for me) happened at their berwick street market stall, a week or so before they finally opened their chinatown venue. there were only a couple of people queuing, and from order to first bite the waiting time was about seven minutes. perfectly acceptable, even though only one waffle maker was working. the other one had gone kaput, but was quickly fixed and put back in use. they didn't have any ice cream as i expected (maybe i misunderstood the pictures/marketing, maybe they were out of ice cream) so my fillings were whipped cream, banana, pecan and salted caramel sauce. all tasty (but i should have asked for more cream/sauce). the fillings in my opinion should have been layered; they just dumped the bananas and pecans on top of the cream and once they were gone it was just the cream.the waffle itself was ok, if nothing mind blowing. it tastes like waffle but much thinner - the bubbles are obviously hollow so it *looks* like you're getting a truckload of food but actually it's not very filling. it's more like a thin crepe in a funny shape. that's all the hype is about: the shape. it's cute, colourful, tasty enough, instagrammable and everything. the duo running the stall seemed a bit overwhelmed with the tiny queue + malfunctioning waffle maker, but always smiling, chatty and helpful. i'd give them a 10 for service.so imagine my surprise a few days later when they opened in chinatown and i saw queues of OVER TWO HOURS. i followed them on twitter to check the reports and as expected they were not prepared for the huge numbers of food-trend-hunters that haunt london streets in search of novelty. every day they were forced to apologize for some vital ingredient missing, and i imagine how pissed i would have been if, after queueing for 2h30, someone told me \"i'm afraid we're out of matcha base/ice cream/bananas/nutella/whatever it is you waited 2h30 for\"it would be better for the business and the customer if everyone waited for the hype to die down a little, but then again i understand this is not how hypes work. in a couple of months there will be another novelty in town (rainbow chips or whatever) and everyone will be flocking there, allowing the \"old news\" to serve a better, consistent service to their (hopefully acquired) faithful clientele - or starving it from customers untill it dies a death. i hope bubblewrap waffle navigates through the initial hickups and stick around, at least for the lovely people making it and serving it.",

We went on a Tuesday evening about 8pm. We waited in line for about 45 min. My sister and I demolished it. The waffle itself has an interesting flavor like a sugar cone but not exactly. Pics are great for IG. We went and stay at a park to the left of the Lego store to eat. They only had 2 people actually assembling or order. One guy was working 3-4 waffle irons at the same time. One young lady was on the register. That's why it takes a while. But just pack your patience. You know everything is fresh because it's made in front of you.",

My friend got the original bubble flavor while I got the special matcha bubble flavor! Both of which are \u00a34.50 each. When I got there, the queue was out of the door. Luckily, it was a fast paced queue which meant that the employees were efficient and speedy! This place was quite easy to find because the sign on the glass window is relatively huge. This is definitely worth a try if you have never had Hong Kong bubble waffles before!",

They only had vanilla or green tea for options on the ice cream and the Oreos were peanut butter so something to be aware of but overall very good and glad we got there",

So we stood in line like everyone. Took roughly 30 minutes. Very small store. Has a big picture window where customers waiting outside in line can see the waffles being prepared. Narrow building so line goes in & wraps around. So everyone is cozy in the line. When you finally make it inside, you can smell the goodness of the waffles. So many options to choose from. There are preset waffle options on the menu or one can create their own. \u00a0We went with one on their preset menu with chocolate. Very tasty little waffle puffs. Very airy & light. Kinda makes you feel like there are no calories, wishful thinking, haha!!",

    "text": "Last Wednesday Bubblewrap Waffle finally opened its doors. The owners were selling their egg waffles on Saturdays at a pop-up stall before and you can tell they know what they're doing! Unfortunately, everyone wants a piece of these egg waffles which leads to a queue time of up to three hours. The quality and taste of the waffles was perfect. The outside was very crisp, while the inside was nice and chewy/ soft. They only had the normal base flavour but they'll offer chocolate and matcha flavoured waffle bases soon. The variety they offer for toppings and ice cream flavours is amazing. I chose strawberries, raspberries, Oreos and Nutella as toppings and the combo didn't disappoint. They were very generous with them and also added some powdered sugar on top. The waffles are a bit challenging to eat because of the massive amount of toppings inside the waffle but nothing a napkin can't fix. Even though we had to wait for so long, it was really worth the wait and all three of us really enjoyed our waffles! The staff is also very friendly and helpful when it comes to ordering and explaining/ suggesting ongoing promotions. If it wasn't for the long queue time I'd definitely give Bubblewrap Waffle five stars! I'll come back to try more of their flavours (and the chocolate and matcha base). Hopefully the waiting times will have reduced in a few weeks and it'll be easier to drop by for dessert.Important to know: they only accept card payments!!!",

    "text": "After a nice stroll down Westminster and into Leicester Square, we walked into Chinatown and were alarmed by a group of people standing in line to go into a store.. We randomly decided to get in line and see what the commotion was about. Turns out it was the grand opening of Bubblewrap!So we waited for a bit [which wasn't that bad as we were trying to figure out what Bubblewrap was and after that, had to get our minds straight on what we wanted in our waffles..]So Bubblewrap is a waffle place that makes waffles that look like ..bubblewrap. First you choose your waffle flavor (plain, chocolate, or matcha), then it's made to order and the waffle is formed into a cone. Then it's stuffed with all sorts of things: ice cream, fruits, chocolate/caramel sauces, chocolate bars, mochi, and even red beans if that's what you fancy. Finally, you either attack it like you would an ice cream cone or pop off the bubbles and dip them into the toppings before popping it in your mouth. Either way, very delicious! Refreshing and oh so enjoyable. My favorite is the one with strawberry cheesecake ice cream and Oreo bits with salted caramel sauce, but I'm very excited to try all the variations -while trying to mind my waistline. My friend got one with vanilla ice cream with strawberries and Nutella on top and loved hers as well. Initially we thought of getting one waffle to share as it seemed like it would be a meal, but we got one each and somehow got through all of it comfortably and it wasn't killing us by the end of it as the waffle is super airy and light. Also, props to them for the sturdy and tightly sealed cardboard waffle receptacle.. It made eating the waffle more convenient and kept the sauces and melting ice cream at bay. It didn't leak at all, making your waffle eating on-the-go experience just that much better. Overall very delightful!",

I will never forget this place and hopefully I'll be back again one day! (Until then please make a shop in LA! )",

We were here about a year and a half ago and there was a massive line out the door and down the street. We didnt want to wait then, but found it to be much more reasonable on this visit. I've seen these type of waffle cones get popular on Instagram and figured I was really missing out on something amazing. In actuality, you are essentially eating ice cream out of a waffle...I don't know what else I was expecting, but it is what it is. Dont get me wrong, all the ingredients were great, especially the gelato! The waffle was warm and soft and made a nice edible container, but I wasn't as blown away as I was expecting to be. Let's just say I enjoyed my dessert, but I am also glad I didnt wait an hour in line to get it.",

My brother went for the plain with hazelnut icecream with nutella and chocolate sauce, and he said his was nice too. Got really messy while eating it! The place is way too overpriced though, and you end up paying quite a lot even if you add just a couple toppings. Not sure its worth it. Its also quite small and there's like no place to sit inside and and wait for your order. You keep rubbing against other customers. Not the best experience. This also means you have to go outside, stand and have your treats.",

The line weaves in to the back, where you pay, and then loops itself back out as they build the ice cream and toppings, this means that people are two across in a space that's less than a meter wide, where it's also a little hot and dark.They would do better to reconfigure the store in a stand or counter format along the front so that they have more room to make the desserts (thus more people and less time for each), and more comfortable for the customers.Now the dessert itself is delicious. But waiting 40 minutes and paying \u00a36-7? Not exactly worth it.",

The fact that there are only 6 Yelp reviews is still surprising, because if you follow new places in London, this place is plastered everywhere. Like, two-hour-wait-plastered-everywhere.Egg waffles are popular where I live, so I wondered what was different about theirs. I had to find out! We stand in line. And as many Brits will tell you, they are the master of the queue. To the point that when other people are walking by us, they too felt like they needed to queue up. Impressive.After an hour wait, we're inside. They're out of the limited waffle flavor (chocolate) and the matcha. I ordered the #4, whose matcha waffle is now a plain one. It's served with a scoop of matcha ice cream, drizzled with salted caramel, and topped with a generous amount of Kit Kats. It's almost too pretty to eat. I take a bite and note that they're the same as home -- good, but not worth a 1-hour wait.I'll say this: the savory one looked appetizing. A whole egg is cracked into the middle of the waffle batter while it cooks and is served with fresh avocado.\u00a36.99 seems about right. (There were a lot of Kit Kats on it.) Bubblewrap could use Nowait (restaurant app) where you can place yourself in the queue, and get texted when you're turn is up next!",

I was surprised the queue actually didn't look as long as I'd expected given it was a nice weekend. We waited around 40 minutes, but it passed by quickly since we could keep each other company and were also trying to figure out what to order. The smell of the waffles is also really enticing while you wait, and you can see some of the staff at work making waffles through the window.I chose the build-your-own, with gelato and 4 toppings, which came out to be about \u00a38. My friend got the House Matcha with no alterations. I really enjoyed mine, but my friend thought his was a bit bland. It was pretty easy to order; you tell the cashier what you want and pay, and then pick up your order when they call it out. Since it's such a small space, it's a bit awkward leaving when you've got your cone, so take care not to spill any of your toppings as you squeeze through. There's not really space to eat inside, but it's mostly a takeaway place anyway.The staff were polite and worked probably as efficiently as they could given the number of waffle makers and all the toppings/decorating involved. The menu showed multiple waffle flavors but all of them were crossed out except the original; probably they couldn't be bothered having to deal with multiple waffle mixes when the queues got long. The menus also made it clear which menu items didn't have cream or gelato in; probably this wasn't clear in the past and they got customer complaints, so they had some pretty conspicuous writing on the menu board to make it clearer.I was really pleased I got to try this out, as I've got a massive sweet tooth and it was fun to eat. However, at \u00a37-8 a cone and with a 40+ min wait on even a good day, it's probably not something I'd do again, now that the novelty has worn off. Maybe I'll come back if they ever bring back the matcha flavored waffles.",

    "text": "My friend Seneca visited London a few weeks before my visit and absolutely RAVED about this place, so naturally it was one of my first stops! I got there about 15 minutes before it opened, and there was already a queue of about 10 people. Luckily the employees are efficient and the line moved quickly. They also passed along menus while you were waiting, so you could decide while in line. I got the original bubblewrap (there was also cocoa and matcha) with matcha ice cream, nutella (naturally) and strawberries. It was absolutely delicious and lived up to the hype. It's also housed in this genius paper cone - there are little perforations along the cone so you can tear off strips as you eat and still avoid getting your hands sticky. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "For me it was just ok. They have original waffle and then other waffle flavors to choose from. The time i went was a cocoa based waffle. I opted to try their strawberry cheesecake with mochi and condensed milk drizzle. It tasted fine but There was nothing mind blowing about it, but i guess with everything nowadays, it was instagram worthy, otherwise, it didn't happen right ;) I've read that the line can take long, sometimes waiting up to 30-45 minutes to put an order in. It was just me in the store and it took 10 minutes for my order. I cant imagine waiting in line for that long though.",

My husband got the peanut butter and I made my own with original waffle cone, matcha gelato, strawberry, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.",

The waffles were soft and warm, and depending on the special of the day, you may be able to get matcha flavored waffles. I also topped mine with a scoop of matcha ice cream, hazelnut ice cream, mochi, and condensed milk. It was delicious and massive. However, there is a long wait for it - about an hour on a weekday afternoon, and they messed up my order so I had to wait even longer.",
