It has the best lasagne in London, which explodes with favor and tastes homemade! \u00a0The spaghetti carbonara is equally as delicious. \u00a0My favorite soup in London is the Fusilli & Pasta soup. The mixed green salad is delicious, simple and has a delicious vinaigrette house dressing (ask for 3x the amount if you like a reasonable portion). \u00a0The bread was not exceptionally fresh, and I do not recommend. If you do order it, beware, as \u00a0you will be charged 0.95 cents per person even though you may only consume a portion of the bread. This bread charge is on top of the service charge! The waiters are friendly, but the place is often very busy at dinner time, so call for reservations to ensure a good seat. I suggest that you review your bill thoroughly as we were charged for two bottles of water, which were never served. Again, the place was heaving with people, so service was just okay. On one occasion, the food was overcooked, so we sent it back and the manager was extremely accommodating to replace/remove. All in all, one of the very best casual Italian restaurants in London, particularly for an extremely good value.",

I was also surprised somebody commented favorably on the 'wine list' and in fact that was a primary reason I picked this place. \u00a0The 'wine list' was four or five kinds of red wine, including 'Barolo - \u00a349.'. No vintage - no winemaker. \u00a0I ordered it anyway ... It was actually a pretty decent food wine, although a bit young. Service was fine. \u00a0The place seems family owned. \u00a0they definitely did not hurry us through the dinner (we did linger awhile over that Barolo, even despite the school cafeteria atmosphere). \u00a0So - all in all - it wasn't what I was looking for, but if you want a decent Italian dinner at a decent price pretty quick, when you're near Paddington - this place will be just the thing.",

I had the garlic and mozzarella bread (more like a thin pizza style dough cut into about 6 pieces and served in a basket) plenty of cheese and great flavor. Then for the master main dish- the BEST meat Lasagna I have ever had. It was chuck full of meat, great tasting sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Baked in a round lasagna dish to perfection. Was able to purchase just a half bottle of wine, good house Chianti served in a nice carafe. Can't wait to come back to London to be able to eat here again. And the cost was very reasonable. Total bill including 10% service was 23 pounds.",

Interesting Christmas decorations still up, the restaurant was half-filled and other tables were enjoying their food.I was given plenty of time to review the menu and decide. The drinks list offered \"Italian Birra\" so I asked the waiter what it was - San Georgio. Sure, I ordered one of those and a plate of lasagna. The waiter also \"upsold\" me to a plate of bread (90p).The beer was cold and when it arrived, the lasagna was still bubbling. Good flavor and well assembled, it tasted like what lasagna should taste like - meaty, cheesy, and lots of layered pasta - and it looked like it too. See picture.The price was good - \u00a313 - and I felt that I got a good value.Would I return? Yes!",

Apparently several staff hadnt shown that night..which however wasn't impressing my friends from NYC! Regardless, all the mains were very good and excellent value for money. My pasta con salmone was creamy without being too rich. A friend had the stuffed chicken breast which was served in a large portion and was fresh and flavourful: crispy on the outside, tasty herb infused stuffing inside. For me, the desserts highlighted the meal. They served the best tiramisu I've had in some time. Delicate sponge, a bit of cream, and heavenly coffee/cinnamon powder on top ....I had to stop myself from gobbling it down too quickly. The banoffee pot was surprisingly tasty, as normally I find them overly sweet yet bland. For Americans who haven't had banoffee: it tastes like a melted Heath Bar. Overall , an enjoyable experience.",

Needing to be close to Paddington station I wasn't too optimistic! If I wanted MCdonalds, KFC, Subway or Burger King we would have been fine!But just 5 minutes down the street we stumbled across Bizzarro's. Quite a strange name, but the look of the restaurant stood out from the rest of the street. It didn't quite seem to belong in its surroundings, which is a good thing,Whilst looking at the menu we were approached by a waiter who has the classic 'cheeky Italian' vibe about him and without being overly pushy asked us if we would like a table. The menu looked plentiful and very reasonable so we went for it!We were seating on a table outside, but with the huge windows completely open we didn't feel detached form the internal restaurant at all. It gave us a very European vibe as it was still early evening.The waiters were incredibly attentive and prompt with their service, with drinks arriving less than a minute after ordering. The food arrived and I was impressed with portion size. The pizza tasted authentic and my girlfriends pasta dish was very filling. We paid promptly, and left with plenty of money still in the wallet! To summarise: This restaurant really does feel genuinely Italian, and i would strongly recommend this place for any pizza lovers close to Paddington!",

I was hungry but not so much, I decided to try out the mushroom pasta they had and my companion had the lasagna. I liked his option better than mine, it was much more flavorful and delicious, mine was a bit plain. Unfortunately I did not have enough space for dessert but they did look appealing. Total bill was around 20 pounds for two people (which is really good).

Otherwise though they are very helpful and are on top of refilling drinks and helping out whenever you need it.",

All of which cost four times my bill here (per meal) but are worth nothing of the quality and flavors I experienced at Bizzaro. When my friend and I first found this place, we literally had dinner at it three days in a row. All the pizzas we tried were great (braseola pizza yumm) and the pastas (beef cannelloni, Pennette con Melanzane e Basilico if you like aubergines, and our allllll time ultimate favorite: Linguine con Pollo & Spinaci with mushrooms added to it) were so flavorful too! Having all the pastas showered with grated parmesan was a delight.We've thoroughly enjoyed all our evenings there, the staff is very attentive and service is quick. The decor is quite dated, but I think that just adds to the charm of an authentic Italian experience. If you're looking for actual Italian food and flavors, this should be your go-to spot.",

It had absolutely no flavour and the sauce was 50% oil, 50% tomato (yuck). We overheard the waiter taking a few more orders and were relieved that he was rude to everyone (atleast we didn't feel special!). They charged an additional service fee and on top of that the waiter didn't warn me that he would charge me an extra pound for EACH vegetable he added to my pasta. Usually restaurants will add an extra 2/3 dollars to add in veggies. Instead they charged me a pound each for every vegetable that they put into my plate.The food and the terrible service paired together made this restaurant a definite member of my \"never go again\" list.",

From the time we walked in we could tell it was a good place to be. Been in business a long time and had a teamwork, family momentum throughout the restaurant. We ordered the risotto on special which was a little bland. I thought it was going to have big shrimp/prawns but instead had tiny bay shrimp. It also had asparagus, but could have used some more flavor/fillings. The other item ordered was a stuffed chicken with vegetables which we both thought was delicious. All of the food at the surrounding tables also looked sooo yummy and everyone was clearing their plates. Since it was our last night we also got cheesecake and chocolate cake which were both so good! I'd certainly give this place a try if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Old school Italian restaurant serving up pasta and pizza dishes in a slightly upscale setting. Easily able to get a table for two on a Monday night as the place is maximized with seating.One thing I immediately noticed is the overwhelming smell of flowers. not sure if it was the greatest scent, yet it's good if you want to cover up everything else. As for the food, ordered the Lasagna (\u00a38.90) - a thick serving of lasagna swimming in a pool of marinara sauce. Cheese is a little burnt, though the waiter comes by and adds some parmigiana on top to offset. Pretty good meal and surprisingly not hefty.A little on the annoying side is the small expenses. They ask if you want sparkling or still; and my friend said sparking which is (\u00a33.90). If you want pasta as main course it's \u00a31 extra. Bread and butter isn't included but \u00a30.95 a person. Gratuity of 10% is added on top. Other than that, a fine sitdown establishment for Italian food.",

    "text": "Everything is \u00e0 la carte here, like in Italy, but the food is not ... like in Italy. Meat dishes come with nothing and bread is \u20ac1/person. A 10% service charge (\u00a34.19 - $5.80) was also automatically included, so our server seemed extremely arrogant and nonchalant, a bit of an ass. Why should he care if the service charge (tip) is mandatory? He did not get a pence more.A half liter of house red wine is \u00a39.40 ($13) on their website menu, but it was \u00a310.20 ($14.15) when the bill arrived. The half liter carafe was far from full and it was not good. I had the Pasta e Fagioli (\u00a34.50) and it was too soupy, had the wrong beans, and bland. Two teaspoons of grated parmesan did not even help. My wife the Olives (\u00a32.90), a decent portion, but a tad spicy-hot because of the sliced jalape\u00f1os in the olive oil. Strange.She had the Fettuccine Prosciutto e Funghi (\u00a38.90 - $12.32 for a \"main\" - \u00a31 more than the small) and I the Vitello Saltimbocca alla Romana (veal topped with prosciutto and sage in a wine sauce - \u00a310.90 - $15.09). Her portion of fettuccine was not very big, so I would hate to see the small version (\u00a37.90), and it was bland with little flavor. My veal was actually beef (you can tell by the color - greyish, not white - and the way it cuts) and had a strange flavor. I am not sure if it was the wine they used, the sage, or both, but it tasted a little of a chemical of some kind.It was a disappointing experience after having read the great reviews, but then some throw 5-Stars around like candy. I guess I am a bit more demanding than most, having lived and traveled extensively in Italy for many years, but this meal was not even close to the 4-Stars (7-8 Bombs) they average on yelp. It was one of the worst \u00a346 ($64) meals I have eaten. Bizzarro!CombatCritic Gives Bizzarro 3 Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!",

    "text": "I'm cringing as I write this, but my experience at Bizzarro was nothing less than (dare I say) bizarre. After reading some great reviews for it on yelp and walking from Notting Hill to Paddington, I was optimistic - and ravenous. We were seated very quickly at a table outside, which was cozy and really pleasant as there was a breeze.Our entrees were pretty good. The lasagna was definitely the highlight of the meal - though it was a little oily, the noodles were well-cooked and flavorful. I ordered the gnocchi as I usually do, and it was just fine. Nothing spectacular, but definitely a decent meal (especially considering the price and the fact that I didn't have to cook it myself).As we are gluttons for punishment and things that are sweet, we each ordered dessert. I had the tartufo: essentially, a few scoops of ice cream rolled in crushed hazelnuts and dusted in cocoa powder. My boyfriend had the banoffee pot: toffee and fake-banana ice cream drizzled in caramel). Both were perfectly portioned, but neither were worth the forty-minute wait.The service was extraordinarily hit or miss. After great, attentive service for the first half of our meal, things completely deteriorated and we were waiting on our dessert and the check for nearly an hour. So if you're craving a standard Italian dish and quite a bit of waiting, hit up Bizzarro.",

I didn't get any flavor from the dish apart from the sauce. I thought I was ordering garlic bread but it was garlic pizza crust and was just OK - glad I said no cheese. I liked the house Chianti, didn't like paying for water and bread. I would probably try this place again, ordering something not in pink sauce.",

Not excellent but good - the American Hot pizza wasnt hot - jalapeno peppers were ordinary green peppers which was a little bit disappointing - the vegetarian selection wasnt amazing either but the venu and friendliness of the staff more than made up for the shortcomings in the food served. Prices given on the menu were out of date (meals were about \u00a31-\u00a32 more expensive than listed) and a service charge was added, which bumped the price up by a bit. But after traipsing around busy london, it was nice to have a relaxed meal. Incidentally, we also tried Garfunkles which is on the same street - while the food was better - i would choose this restaurant to Garfunkles everytime!",

While the ambiance wasn't amazing, it was comfortable although the tables were a bit packed together.The real stand out of Bizzaro though is the service. We had visited during off-hours as well as a time when the entire restaurant was packed and there was a line out the door, and we received the same outstanding level of service every time, which was unparalleled to what I usually find in restaurants today. Fabrizzio and the rest of the crew were attentive to all customers and patient under very stressful situations and never missed a beat - always delivering their service with a smile and a funny joke.I would definitely recommend if you find yourself near Paddington Station and are looking for a great Italian meal served with great service.",
