But, if you make the effort (especially in the winter) you will find the cosiest (real fires), cutest pub with the cosiest (with a big gourmet slant) gastropub fare in town. Huge portions of melting Ox cheeks, hot bramley apple crumble to name a few. After your feast relax into the deep gentleman's leather sofas in the back rooms with a Baileys and ice.. heaven..(Book ahead though). (Monikasays.com)",

    "text": "I can recommend getting to The Gun on a sunny Sunday afternoon (it pays to be hanging around for opening time at noon) and indulging in a lovely brunch on the riverside terrace. Their Egg Benedict and Eggs Royale are delicious \u00a0piquant Hollandaise sauce (not too runny) plus eggs poached to perfection \u00a0consisently gooey inside, and done the proper way (no marks from cling film or pan techinques here). It took a little while for our plates to arrive, but this was no real bother. The eastward view across the Thames towards the O2 Arena as the sun pops up is interesting enough to pass the time, and you can always bring your Sunday papers along anyway! The interior is pleasingly characterful, with open fires and flagstone floors. The pub comes with a bit of history (Nelson used to meet his mistress Emma Hamilton here apparently) and you can book rooms for private hire.",

I happened upon The Gun's website, and boy am I glad I did. They offered us a private dining room at no extra cost, with an amazing river view. The menu was well thought through, perfectly cooked and nicely executed. One of the red wines I ordered was a little off and this was happily removed and switched for another. The staff were attentive and arranged cabs for us all at the end of the night. On my trip home, the pub manager called to say of my party had left his laptop bag behind. She offered to keep hold of it and pop it in a cab back to us the next morning, which she duly did and texted me to let me know it was on its way. Top service, great food and an accommodating team.",

    "text": "I was recently treated by a friend to a well executed and very tasty huge meal The Gun. We started off with oysters as a pre-starter, then shared the scallops and foie gras. The oysters were of a very good quality and very flavourful. The scallops were prepared with garlic and samphire; an excellent combination. The foie gras with prunes was creamy and smoky. For mains, we picked salt marsh lamb and steak tartare. The lamb was excellent - tender, juicy and not gamy. The steak tartare was good, but not great. It didn't have enough of a kick for me and it wasn't prepared at the table, it came already prepared from the kitchen. Apple souffle and a chocolate fondant were our choices for dessert. The souffle was served with a cinnamon creme and was expertly executed. It was tart, but set off with the right amount of sweetness, and combined with the cinnamon creme was divine. The fondant disappointed a bit - it looked a bit anemic and there wasn't much melty-chocolatey-oozy goodness. I'd skip that next time. The service was excellent - friendly, warm, prompt and attentive without being overly solicitous. The interior is nice and cozy, with a fireplace near the bar in the back and simple dining tables on the side of the main front bar. The deck overlooking the river and the O2 is pretty spectacular. I'll have to revisit on a less deluvian night. But, it is a trek to get out there. The bill for this feast, wasn't cheap - approximately \u00a3160 for the food and a couple of aperitifs and digestifs.",

    "text": "Having only been there once, its hard to pass a full judgment on it. However these are my first impressions. The establishment is very nice, with a wonderful view of The Millennium Dome, external areas where to eat from on a hot summer's day and an authentic old public house feel to it.. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Whilst waiting for my friends, I decided to have a drink... I was driving so I went for a Virgin Bloody Mary. It was tasty and came with a long celery stick. It was also \u00a33.50, which seems a bit excessive for a virgin drink. We started with oysters and prawns to share as a starter. All was very good and beautifully presented. Not a big fan of oysters but had a couple anyway. When it came to the main course, I ordered pork belly with potatoes, vegetables and yorkshire pudding. The pork was a bit dry and as there wasn't enough gravy on it, we had to order more. The potatoes were very disappointing, as they felt and tasted like they had been cooked hours before. The portions were on the small side, although that's probably because they want you to get some side orders. The dish was OK tasting, not bad, but certainly not the best one I've had, and not even good enough to leave a real lasting impression. I can think of many other places where I've had a better pork belly.... My friends ordered the beef sunday roast, and that looked appettizing, although their dishes shared the same potatoes and vegetable that I did. I then had the crumble with custard. This somewhat redeemed The Gun from the lackluster main course. The crumble was delicious and the custard was clearly home made. Whilst none of the above justify dismissing this gastropub completely, the fact that we spent \u00a345 each (5 of us + 2 bottles of averagely priced wine) suggests that it is slightly overpriced.",

    "text": "The Gun is a pub in the docklands, South Quay, which is one stop before Canary Wharf on the DLR. It's a fairly large pub situated on a tiny, fictional looking street. The Gun has a number of features, firstly it's outdoor seating is right on the river, on the opposing side of the O2 and north Greenwich. It has an alfresco dining section for the summer which serves beautiful Portugese food and a great selection of cocktails and unlike other pubs and bars, if you choose to sit outside there is a purposely built bar outside which saves you having to go in and out all the time to get your drinks. There's also another designated restaurant area which serves food inside the pub, tucked away in the back corner.The Gun is the kind of place where you could literally spend hours upon hours, especially in the summer. The Gun is our local pub so we often venture there after we've been for a meal, it's also a great meeting place before a big night out, the drinks are priced on the more expensive side of pub prices and the food is relatively expensive. The food in the general restaurant area is in the pricing range of a good restaurant \u00a0which may be justifiable for the Alfreso dining section (as I have never tried it i wouldn't know) as it always smells awfully good, however I had a wild boar burger from the general restaurant which was priced at twelve pounds and I can think of many restaurants where I could have eaten a much better burger for a better price.The nibbles they serve are really nice and although still on the expensive side are good for picking at if you're there just to chill, they do a beautiful bread selection with a pesto dip thing, they also have an amazing cheese board served with grapes and all the extras for a cheese board.  The Gun, all in all, although slightly pricey is a really nice way to chill out for an evening or during the day over the weekend. It's a cool place to get dressed up and go with the girls or a big group of friends and people do dress to impress here \u00a0which is slightly strange for a pub, but nice nevertheless.In order to get the full feel for this place it's best to attend in the summer.",

    "text": "We landed at The Gun at 1pm and left at 18:30 hrs. That's a proper long boozy lunch for ten people who all love their food without a single complaintso big shout from the ten of us to The Gun. Wicked service, great foodand perhaps most importantly, a beautiful old pubwhich is important as its a little bit tucked away from central London. First, a few pints overlooking the river on a lovely sunny dayit was a good start. Great Guinness by the way, another healthy sign. We were ten for lunch so we took the dining room upstairs aka The River Room. You're supposed to have the set-menu when you take this room which is a bit annoying but they were extremely helpful and allowed us to have the a la carte menu. The room itself has a nice old-school feel to it, with a wicked mahogany dining table that sits up to 14, cool paintings, spacious and airy, and overlooking the river. There's even a stereo to create an ambience should you want one. Our assigned hostess for lunch was extremely cool, friendly and professionaland you need to be with a party like oursit was all take, take, take. Anyway, we were treated to a complimentary glass of champagne which again was an extremely good coup. We nailed three courses each and drank some damn good wine. Starters were pints of prawns, fois gras, potted smoked mackerel and baked goats cheeseall pretty solid. It was all about the mains though, the pan-fried stonebass was perfectly cooked and accompanied. Rissotto of jerusalem artichoke was mouth-wateringly delicious. The steaks were juicybut I went to Argentina recently so its a bit hard to eat steak in this country now. I normally don't give a toss about vegetables but even I was drawn to the spinach.it just looked so fresh and perfect and glistening in its cute little bowl, it was hard to ignore. And whist the pointlessness of vegetables is not something that troubles me on a day to dat basis, some vegetables just are better than others, for example, The Potato. Maybe that's not a vegetable actually, think its a tuber or something. Anway, no great meal is great without some kind of tuber, and The Gun's ratty spuds were yummy. I'm not sure what ratty is but its definitely not of the rodent variety you'll be pleased to know. I'm more of a savoury man and don't normally do deserts but I'm big enough to give it a go once in a while, any any menu that sports the words banana and tatin, has my approval. That's a banana tatin in case you're not good at putting words together. I did try the cheese-cake, I'm not really into cheese-cake so my opinion is just my opinion but I thought it was a bit bland. But I ate and shared none of my banana tatin Book a table, wicked afternoon!",

When you walk in you're welcomed into such a beautiful pub, wood fire and a lovely terrace that overlooks the river. They have a great selection of ales which I loved but only the generic lagers which didn't go down too well with the other members of my party. We then sat down for our meal very excited as I had heard great things. The starter of the rabbit terrine did not disappoint and soon disappeared from my plate. It then came to the main, I had ordered the lamb for \u00a323. For that sort of price I would expect the best piece of lamb perfectly cooked. What came out was a fatty over cooked lump. The only saving grace was the jus. Other members of the party that ordered the same dish also agreed theirs were over cooked but as we had already gone through a few bottles of wine we didn't want to ruin the night further by sending four dishes back to the kitchen and sit waiting for it to be re done. The others that had ordered the pork had been very lucky as I had tried a small bite and that was amazing. Maybe I was just unlucky that night but have to rate it on my personal experience. I may go back in the future to try it out again, but at those high prices I won't rush anytime soon. (Visit - 24/10/2014 Dinner)",

    "text": "This must be one of my favorite places in London: not only for the lovely food and location, but particularly because of its slightly secluded nature, which makes it an unlikely destination for tourists or strangers. Not being a native Londoner I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to discover this place, thanks to a bunch of colleagues and a totally unrelated paintball experience.The Gun is located in the former docks area, near Canary Wharf. In fact, I think we scored full points by reaching the area with a TFL boat from Embankment in a beautiful sunny sunday and walking through the surreal atmosphere of the skyscraper area in the weekend (the gun is on the opposite side of the wharf with respect to the pier). There normally is a small staircase descending from the Cartier Circle roundabout to an anonymous southbound road that hugs the coast and ultimately brings to Cold Harbour, but it's closed for works, so we had to walk on a pretty long and unexpected northbound diversion (not unpleasant, though, given that it skirts a couple of nice boathouse docks). It was a 20m walk that added some charm to the experience: we got to the pub hungry as bears, and asked to be seated outside. Not that the inside is bad: it's actually a wonderful place, but it simply can't compete with the terrace on the Thames, overlooking a quiet bight of the river with the O2 on the opposite side. That for me, coupled with the beers we ordered to complement the food (and kept warm by the hat-shaped radiators), is the perfect London experience. Apparently the Gun is one of the most reputed gastropubs. It's a fact that both times I ate there I was very happy with the food as well. This last time we ordered Oysters+Guinness (a matching suggested by the house that was very appreciated by the person who ordered it), a pigeon salad where the meat was tasty and full of personality, a fennel soup (smooth and well balanced), a perfect roasted pork belly and various side dishes (cheese, broccoli, etc.). Everything very good, everything not expensive: we walked out very satisfied with a \u00a390 bill for three people. In fact, I'm not sure whether I should glorify this place as it deserves or just keep it to myself and be sure to find a spot to eat next time I go there...",

When we arrived, we were ushered to the back room, where only we were seated. There was a 95 pound tasting menu, which included the following: Canap\u00e9s and a glass of Joseph Perrier Champagne NV (good) - Amuse bouche: Jerusalem artichoke soup, fennel foam (awesome) - Gressingham duck, game and foie gras terrine, fig and jasmine jam (awesome) - Scottish lobster ravioli, confit tomato, lobster bisque, iced fennel (good if you like fennel, but I do not) - Devilled loin and roast rack of lamb, white onion pur\u00e9e, sweetbreads, fondant potato, sprout tops (huge and delicious) - Lemon posset (ok as a palette cleanser, but unnecessary) - Chocolate and hazelnut marquis (too rich after so decadent a meal) - Coffee/tea and petit fours (these weren't petit fours, they were more like various brownies) - Glass of Joseph Perrier Champagne NV at midnight The only thing I found a bit annoying was the people in the \"dance\" room next to us. These were people that had not dined, but rather paid for a \"space\" at the bar; they were falling down drunk and ridiculous. I mean, I know it's New Years, but please. Oh, and the guy next to us fell asleep at the dinner table he was so drunk - which strangely made the night more and less entertaining simultaneously. The food was good, and I would return in the summer to try out the patio, which looks great.",

Their best dishes seem to be game and some of the slightly odder cuts of more typical meats (e.g., veal tongue). They do a very nice burger as well. The bar menu is good, but be sure to book a table and eat in the proper restaurant area to experience the full menu and specials.The location is a bit unfortunate, but the view from their outside deck (across the water from the O2) makes it all worthwhile in the summer. During the colder months, you and your beer can snuggle up with the fireplace roaring in the back.",

    "text": "Was really surprised to see this place already reviewed on Yelp, it's tucked down a back street in the depressing docklands area. Rocked up here for a team lunch expecting to find typical English pub grub and footy on the telly. Eh no. It's actually quite a posh place with tables properly set up for dinner. Dark wood, guns on the wall, classic paintings. \u00a0Dressed corporately, we must have looked like bankers, wallets stuffed with cash, ready to party like it's 2007. Again, eh no. The vibe in this place is definitely up-sell. We were ferried into the back room, or the captain's room, as it seemed, with a giant wall painting of Nelson and some other contemporary looking gents. Disconcerting. Since we'd been given the dinner menu which ranged from \u00a315 up, we had to troop back into the pub to get anything off the bar menu. But you're not gonna get fish and chips or a ham sandwich in this pub, the cheapest thing was Welsh Rarebit and a half pint of prawns. Then they tried to up-sell us on the Argentinean special, a steak for \u00a330. A colleague mentioned how the last time he was in, he tried to order chips and was sent to the deck where the Portuguese BBQ was set up, cheapest option \u00a318. Since we'd abandoned the captain's table and not ordered the steak, we were obviously bumped in the kitchen's priorities and waited about a half hour for food to appear. A half hour... for essentially cheese on toast. Meh. The general consensus was that the food wasn't great. Welsh Rarebit was way too rich, the chicken pie was like chicken soup but the fish finger sandwich seemed alright. If it's a sunny day, you want an extra cold Guinness and a nice plate of food on the deck overlooking the river then by all means go. Did I mention they have guns here? Awesome.",

Fantastic views of the river and a very British menu to pick from.I would highly recommend the Bloody Mary and you must try the ETM wine (the wine created by the owners of the pub). For food the oysters are a must have along with the Portuguese Salt Code Croquettes!If coming on the train use either South Quai or Canary Wharf stations!",

I was brought the wrong order at first, and then another 10 minutes later, when the burger did finally appear, there was no cutlery, napkins or sauces with it.

Probably not massively banter-ous, but it's a busy place and they're keeping on top of things - it's appreciated- Moreish high quality food. All of it was good. Every single morsel. I also loved the touch of bringing out the giant bread basket and allowing you to select what you wanted out of it. Classy!- An outdoor terrace area that can be hired for private events which is just too gorgeous.Note: It's on the pricier end of the posh pub spectrum, but it really is fab and worth it.",

It was super busy on a fairly warm Friday night - lots of single men to flirt with while waiting for my buddies to get back from the bar ;)We had trouble finding a spot to perch in and so we ended up getting a table to sit down and eat a proper dinner. Definitely at the posh gastro-pub end of the spectrum and sadly only a minimum of veggie items. I ended up ordering the goats cheese and beetroot starter, thinking it might fill me up a bit - since I often find starters are enough. But no, it was great tasting -though with miniscule portions! Luckily there was plenty of bread (sourest sourdough I've ever had!) and I tried some of my friend's yummy chips! \u00a0We shared some desserts that were also beautifully presented - and the staff were incredibly friendly to us, which was the cherry on our dinner/cake ;)PS It is horribly complicated and longwinded finding this place from Canary Wharf so I'd advise taking the bus from Mile End which takes you right there!

The Gun is a gorgeous gastropub situated next to the Thames with a wonderful of the water and full view of the O2 in the back dining room. A small portion of the terrace is open air while a large portion is covered by glasses so your view is unobstructed despite sitting indoors. The inside dining room is super cozy with two fireplaces. We ordered:- chicken and artichoke terrine: really good and a really unique dish- stewed rabbit loin with sausage roll: delicious, but the rabbit was mushy for some reason- ricotta tortellini with kale pesto: good- peanut parfait with banana and caramel glazed popcorn: really good, tasted like a snickers bar, extremely stingy with the bananaThe place has wonderful atmosphere and good service (automatic 12.5% gratuity though), but the value isn't fully there. To be totally full, you will have to order a starter (around \u00a315), and main (around \u00a325), AND a dessert (around \u00a37), which will total around \u00a345 a person without drinks and without gratuity. If you come here not too hungry, you might get away with less.The food is good here though, and their menu changes seasonally. If you're in the neighbourhood and are looking for some traditional british gastropub food and a good view, you definitely should visit",

I looked through Yelp suggestions for the area and found this one to have the highest ratings... and boy, are they justified! But let's start at the start! The pub is a little harder to find as it's quite out of the way, but it has a fantastic view over the water and the O2. The walk is definitely worth it. The staff was super friendly and helpful, they explained all the available specials and left us to peruse the menu. It's not very extensive, which is good as too much selection is usually a bad sign. Three of us went for the Sunday roast (which comes in roast beef, pork or lamb) and one went for two starters instead of a main.All four meals arrived precisely at the same time and were presented really well and UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS! \u00a0I've tried many Sunday roasts in a variety of pubs, but this one definitely wins out by miles! The meat was tender and flavourful, the potatoes crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, the vegetables had just the right amount of bite to them and the Yorkshires were perfect. The portions were great and the quality superb. I absolutely understand why this pub has such a high rating. It's definitely worth it for the food as well as the view and the lovely staff. Big win all around!",

Each little room has a different feel and the spacious covered back patio serves as a nice spot on a beautiful day. Even though it was a little chilly on the day we were there, they had heaters on the back that made it quite comfortable. It definitely gives your the feeling of a traditional, historic English pub.The food was quite surprising. I had a goat cheese panna cotta for an appetizer and the pesto lamb as my entree. The plating was beautiful here, not what you would expect from pub food. My panna cotta was very interesting (in a good way), both in consistency and taste. The lamb was tender and flavorful. The courses are a bit smaller but I had three courses so that was plenty of food. I really think this is one of the best pubs in London - between the atmosphere and the food. The only downsides are that it feels a bit out of the way unless you live/work near the wharf and the service was a bit lacking as our waiter was unfriendly. It's still not enough from me to sway from my 5-star rating though!",

A pub with an amazing view, taxidermy on the walls, a big fire, a long bar and a restaurant. I have been here a few times as my friend used to live round the corner, the prices are a bit aimed at the workers of Canary Wharf so can be a tad expensive. \u00a0In the Summer they usually do big jugs of Pimms which is as you'd expect is very tasty and then you can sit on the terrace and look out on the river view. The food I have eaten has always been off the pub menu but you can go from one extreme, a sausage roll with HP sauce for \u00a36. (Not a typo). To one of the best tasting burgers I've had in a pub. The burger is the \"The Gun Burger\" which is made up of beef shin, cheddar cheese, coleslaw and some big hand cut chips, I recommend this burger if you want a feast and then have a nice drink sitting in the comfy chairs with a fire and taxidermy. If you like cheese, they have a cheese selection that changes monthly, if you are trying to eat on a budget they offer a \u00a310 set menu at lunch which is very reasonable.",

    "text": "A lovely place for a drink in the depths of the docklands! I was surprised at how upmarket it was inside - when you enter the left hand side of the room is laid out with white tablecloths like a high-end restaurant. We perched on a couple of bar stools to start with and enjoyed the selection of beers on offer, both bottled and on tap. The barmen were also good for a chat - as was the patron next to us. or maybe we just caught everyone in a good mood! I was intrigued by the restaurant section so had a quick skim of the food menu too which was a bit on the pricey side for what we were looking for - enter the more affordable bar food menu, so we ended up staying for dinner. It was a decent feed but nothing special and my fish-finger sandwich still felt overpriced at \u00a39ish. Meanwhile I thought the bar staff could've been a bit more on top of the food menu as we ordered a \u00a34 side of chips after they told us the pie of the day wasn't served with any... but turns out it is! Oh well, there's far worse problems to have than double chips, and the presentation was at least pretty good. I'd come back for the gorgeous river views and inviting bar, but I think I'd stick to drinks next time.",
