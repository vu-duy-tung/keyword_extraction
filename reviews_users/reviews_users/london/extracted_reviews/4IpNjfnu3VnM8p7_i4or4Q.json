We decided to go to our table due to the late time of our booking. We were seated in a bay by the window looking into the centre of the restaurant which was a good seat. The waiter service was great. The sommelier was helpful in choosing our wine from a great selection and the wine we chose was very good. I had the steak tartare as my starter which was very moist and tasty. The Vienna schnitzel was a good size and actually tastier than what I have had in Vienna itself! The steak that was had by my friends were done as ordered (rare for one friend and well done for the other) and both tasted quite good. Dessert consisted of the black forest cake and the chocolate fondant. Both tasted very good.",

    "text": "Anyone leaving the north concourse of St Pancras station, or the new north ticket hall of King's Cross underground station will see this small but handsome and historic building across the road. It's currently used as an exhibition space by the developers undertaking the redevelopment of the area north of King's Cross, but is well preserved and is worth a peek inside. History Unusually for a building with an interesting name in London, the German Gymnasium was exactly what its name implies: originally known as 'Die Turnhalle', it was erected in 1864-65 for use by the German Gymnastics Society. It also housed a library. The architect was Edward Gruning. Paid for solely by donations from the German community in London, it is believed to have been the first purpose-built gymnasium in the United Kingdom. The Society was also innovative in other ways, with women's exercise classes introduced in 1866, and in the same year it hosted the gymnastic events in the first National Olympic Games. The main exercise hall was an impressive space with a floor to ceiling height of 57ft. Ropes for exercises were hung from the roof trusses, which are still in place today (albeit without the ropes). The trusses themselves are made of laminated wood - an early use of this technology. In 1908 a mezzanine floor was inserted, giving it the form we see today. Part of the western fa\u00e7ade was removed in association with the works on adjacent St Pancras station, but a new fa\u00e7ade erected in keeping with the rest of the building. The building The building is built of yellow stock brick, with red-brick detailing in a vaguely Lombardic style, although the windows are square. The roof has a continuous lantern along the ridge. Inside, the main hall was built like a church, with a nave and two tiers of aisles separated by a row of tall cast-iron columns, decorated with elaborate Early English foliage capitals. The columns are still there, but the mezzanine (with its impressive wooden floor) and subsequent alterations make the plan a bit harder to see. Most of the space has been painted a slightly clinical white, in keeping with its current role as an exhibition and conference space, and offices have been inserted within the structure as well. However, enough remains (especially at mezzanine level) to give you an impression of how impressive it must originally have looked. The building is listed at Grade II. Practicalities Right by the exits to the Northern Ticket Hall of Kings Cross - St Pancras underground station. The building has a lift to the mezzanine, a disabled toilet and level access. In the ground floor is a large scale model of how the Kings Cross development is intended to look when completed. The building is open to the public between 10:00am and 5:30pm, Tuesdays to Thursdays, and 10:00am to 4:30pm on Fridays. Free entry.",

    "text": "I had wanted to go here for a while after hearing great things from friends and on reviews so decided to try it out for my birthday meal with a group of friends. One of my friends and I arrived earlier than our booking and said we were happy to wait at the bar but we were told we could go straight to the table which was great! We decided to have cocktails while we waited. I had a Bellini which was nice. My friend's cocktail was described as long and refreshing and it was the complete opposite in size (& taste) to the extent that we were worried we'd been given the wrong order. She asked the waitress who was serving us when she came by; she simply didn't answer and poured the remaining drink into my friend's glass which we thought was really rude and offhand. When the rest of our group arrived about five minutes later, we ordered drinks and our food. We decided to go for a bottle of red for three of the four of us and the sommelier suggested that we might like to try a sample of one of the wines we were thinking of & of course she recommended a more expensive choice. When we stuck with our choice, she clearly wasn't happy and acted as if she hadn't offered a sample to try. Very odd. We made it in time to have the set menu which was very good value - our starters and mains were delicious; three of us had the sausage salad for starters and two of us had the schnitzel for mains. For dessert, I had the peanut butter ice cream with salted caramel pretzels which was simply divine and two of my friends had the apple strudel which they said was lovely too. I was bought a nice complimentary birthday dessert too. Overall we had a lovely time; the background of the restaurant and the decor is beautiful and I'd recommend it. It's located right near Kings Cross station and Granary Square so very handy for public transport and in a regenerated, funky part of town.",

    "text": "German Gymnasium at King's Cross is a worthy addition to the London restaurant landscape. The wine list focused on German and Austrian winemakers is outstanding and reason enough to check out this place. And once you're there, you won't do anything wrong by ordering a veal schnitzel.To honour my German heritage, I decided to head to German Gymnasium, a newly opened restaurant next to King's Cross station. The building looks beautiful and inside, the airy architecture is something you will probably rarely see in other London dining rooms. The restaurant spans across two floors, while the top floor is more like a balcony, leaving most of the space open, so you can see up to the wooden ceiling. Right between St. Pancras and King's Cross, the location could hardly be better, especially with all the new offices that are currently being built in the area.Despite I was coming straight from the WINE CA4R BOOT wine event, I decided to start with a beautiful glass of white wine. I was very surprised to see a Rivaner on the menu. I like Rivaner as a lovely light summer wine. Today, I had it for my dinner, because I perhaps could not handle anything stronger anyway after quite a few tasters I already had that evening. The Rivaner 'Clos des Eglantiers' from Domaine Bastian in Luxembourg was everything a Rivaner should be - fresh, a bit grassy perhaps, and easy to drink - so I was more than happy with it.If you like German and Austrian wines, this place is paradise for you. The selection they offer by the glass is broad and excellent. Starting with a few nice slices of bread, three different kinds and some butter, kept me busy and I did not wait long until I got my main. The veal schnitzel was huge and the warm potato salad was hidden below. Because I could not see it, I asked for it, just for the waiter to tell me where it is on my plate - a bit awkward. Really, burying the potato salad is unnecessary in my opinion, but when it comes to the taste, it was \u00a0palatable and authentic. The dressing was not my kind of thing, but I know that it is one of the ways to do it - there are many different recipes depending on the region. The bread crumbs of the veal schnitzel were incredibly fluffy and it all tasted simply delicious. I was surprised by the sweetness of the lingonberry compote - actually, I think it was perhaps a bit too sweet. However, this sweetness complemented the potato salad perfectly. The different elements of the dish blended nicely and everything together formed a very good veal meal.After finishing my main, I was not really hungry anymore. But their nutty temptation, a hazelnut praline pot with chantilly cream and brittle, quickly convinced me to order a pudding anyway. It was a truly delightful dessert with a great hazelnut flavour.As I was sitting at the bar, I had a good overview. The place was fairly busy that evening. All staff I talked to were very friendly, and they regularly topped up my water. Watching over the bar, it seemed the bartenders know what they are doing.German Gymnasium is a place I will definitely visit again - a great showcase for German and Austrian wines, where you can sip your drink in a modern, buzzy atmosphere surrounded by an impressive building.",

Greeted by pretty hostesses in geometric black and white dresses and whisked away to our table in the brasserie to music with a heavy bass. Dapper gentlemen waiters in suits plus other staff were very attentive and friendly. Started with a drink -- the 1866 cocktail -- balanced sweet/acidic orange. Moved on to the oysters ... Very creative side plate of layered pumpernickel bread and butter which was delicious! Friends got the goulash soup which was amazing (incredible depth of flavour)!!! \u00a0Main was short ribs with snitzel \u00a0-- was nice although difficult to get into before asking for a steak knife! Friends had the curry wurst with chips which was disappointing as it was on the sweet side and a bit too fancy for the traditional German street food (missing the soft roll!). Nice wine selection with a variety of price points. A large variety of desserts -- we shared the apple strudel with vanilla sauce which was traditional and good. I definitely will be back as its a great atmosphere and space ... I think the food will continue to improve as this new restaurant settles in.",

I also had the rocket and tomato salad, which had a nice light dressing, and a side of carrots. For dessert I ordered the apple strudel which was my least favorite of anything I ordered.

The restaurant and bar are split over two levels, with the top platform stretching around the outside walls so you can look down and see the other diners below. We started the evening with drinks, a fantastic selection of bellinis really took my fancy (I couldn't stop drinking the peach and elderflower ones - delish!) We had originally booked a table for 6 but had two extra guests and the staff were really helpful in accommodating us.As another reviewer said, I was not excited by German cuisine and I found it quite difficult to pick a main course. I ordered the hot dog with a side of chunky chips. It was tasty but not as hot as I would have liked, and it felt strange to be eating this dish in such a lovely plush venue. The staff were helpful and our glasses were never empty.I would definitely recommend for drinks, especially if meeting friends from other parts of London as it is a stones throw from kings cross station!",

With all the gentrification in the Kings Cross area it is no surprise that King's Cross has become a trendy social seen for the young and trendy. And what could reflect this more than a two tiered establishment literally outside the station. You could get off the train from Cambridge, and be 10 steps from cocktails and dinner. German Gymnasium is in that category of not quite fine dining yet not run of the mill either. It is trying to be very hip and even a bit clubby. And as you walk into the massive space which used to be a gymnasium, hence the name, there are model like hostesses and expected lounge music to welcome you. The place is divided into two parts, the ground floor being the restaurant and the upstairs veranda overlooking the grand space below is the large lounge bar area. Plush chairs and shiny bar contrasting with the original vaulted ceilings and arched spaces of what once was London's first gymnasium, so it claims. Very stylish if not predictable, the kind of decor you might see in Heal's, its all on trend, but not necessarily cutting edge or anything.The important part, the drinks were good. And even waiting for the cocktail waitress to bring them was not an overly long wait, which was impressive for a busy Friday night. Finger food of mini hot dogs for example was fine but not overly exciting. Sort of a hipster foodie vibe perhaps. The main problem is if you are at the side end of the lounge as we were we were right in the pathway of the waitstaff going to the kitchen which was just behind us and very visible. The kitchen door swinging back and forth frequently let in sharp light contrasting the darkness of the bar killing the mood. Not to mention constantly being shoved a side by the waiters no matter how politely they tried meant you were always in the way and conversation was constantly being interrupted. There was absolutely no place to move to be out of their way unless we sat down, and all the seats were taken. So that IS a problem they will have to fix in order to cope with crowds.Overall the experience was enjoyable. The space is attractive and makes for a fun night out with a larger group of friends. While I wouldn't put it quite at that 'wow!' factor it was stylish, a good all rounder and great for that weekend drinking experience.",

We were met by a waiter and headed to a table in their outside area. The waiters were very friendly and helpful and recommended a number of rose wines (numerous!)We sat outside and enjoyed our delicious glass of chilled rose, warmed by the heaters above. It was bliss!Now for the wow... I needed the toilet so headed inside and that was it. The building inside is truly stunning - I was completely taken a back and felt very out of place in my trainers. It's modern, yet classics and has two levels so you're able to sit above and look over onto the other diners and drinkers. Just beautiful.I would highly recommend for a luxury evening! I won't be going back with trainers on that's for sure!",

    "text": "The idea of German cuisine doesn't exactly get me excited, but this spot just opened a few months ago and is part of the new redeveloped area by King's Cross and Granary Square. I was stunned by how busy it was when I came for dinner with friends on a Thursday evening. They have some great outdoor tables with heat lamps that are shielded from the general passers-by with a garden hedge, and inside it is very impressive with high ceilings, swanky bars on both floors, and a ton of seating - this must be able to fit well over a hundred people! It's rare to find a space of this size in London. When I arrived, I was told that my friends were upstairs at the bar on the first floor, where they had a nice table and were enjoying a few cocktails. I had the Sex & City cocktail that came in a bottle and was served over ice with edible flowers. It was beautiful - would be happy just to come here for drinks, regardless of German food! They also seem to do free refills of the bar snacks, which are pretzels and olives.We then moved to our table downstairs, which was in the middle part of the restaurant but the tables weren't crowded too closely together. The menu is a tricky thing - one of my friends had been here before and said she had ordered the fish, but when one of her dining companions ordered the bratwurst, she completely regretted it. We also saw some people eating out-of-place salads. I ordered the white asparagus off the special with \u00a01/2 of a veal schnitzel, while my friends both got the goulash, which is served with sp\u00e4tzle. My asparagus was very light tender, and came with a hollandaise sauce, and went well with the schnitzel, which was ok, but not the best schnitzel I have ever eaten. My friends' goulash was definitely more of a short rib than a stew, and the sp\u00e4tzle came in a separate small pot but looked very good. We also got an order of their triple cut chips, which were enormous and are large square cuts that remind me of the size of polenta fries.For dessert, we had the twice baked cheesecake and the hazelnut praline. The praline was like a mousse / parfait, and it was far too sweet for my tastes. The cheesecake was tasty and I liked the blueberry sauce that came with it, where you could see whole blueberries. For wine we chose a pinot noir from Germany, though I was out of my league because most of the names on the list were from either Germany or Austria, and I know very little about their red wine. The one strange thing about the meal was our server, who seemed stressed and flustered and would missed small details like giving us the wine list when we got the menus, questioning why we wanted chips when we had sp\u00e4tzle, picking the seal off of the wine bottle after she'd already poured it, not taking plates away, etc. I wasn't wow'ed by the food, but it's clearly a cool spot and definitely worth stopping by for a drink if you're in the area.",

We had some decent starters but nothing memorable (and it's hard to miss a smoked salmon...), but then for the main we had the duck for 2 people and that was extremely disappointing. It is supposed to be there top dish and it comes with great serving ritual (cut at your table, served in front of you etc), but it was a shame to waste such good meat by overcooking it! It was completely dry, even the legs, to the point where it was hard to eat and swallow. And the seasoning is very low quality: gravy very sweet like bad jam... For the bill we had at the end that was not acceptable.",

The interior looked fancy but the food was just ok. My mom got the schnitzel for her meal. It was very thin and she said it tasted like cardboard. The schnitzel was also very dry and bland. My sister got the soup and she liked it. Everyone in our 19 people group loved the sausages. In total, very mixed feelings about this restaurant but we would not recommend because there are plenty of good restaurants in London. But if you decide to go, stick with the basics. (I.e. Sausages, soups, potatoes.)",

    "text": "Kings Cross is kind of still my home, although I don't reside in the area at the moment. A few years ago I made a clever flat investment on the Caledonian Road which I now rent out. Over the years I have been lucky enough to see the changing face of the area. Eurostar popped up allowing you to travel internationally, the back of Kings Cross station was developed and is now home to fantastic restaurants such as Grain Store, Caravan and more recently, Dishoom. It even upped its cool factor with Central Saint Martin College, the world-famous art college, planting its roots firmly here.There is no shortage of things to do in the area with Granary Square hosting outdoor festivals and cinemas, Frame with its outdoor yoga and fitness sessions and of course, a train ride to Paris!German Gymnasium, part of the heavy weight restaurant group D&D London, has grabbed a site which was originally a sporting association for the German Gymnastics Association, on Kings Boulevard. As I had my shoe designer friend in from Los Angeles (sounds so glam I know), I thought it would be nice to check out this evolving side of Kings Cross. D&D London have been around for a long time, so I had faith that they would know what they are doing. There appears to be two areas aside from the bar, which is not immediately clear when you book online. I thought we would be in the Grand Cafe, but as we had chosen an a la carte menu we were put in the restaurant upstairs. The restaurant circles around the edge of the big hall like space, so you can look down into the central Grand Cafe. The restaurant is quite a formal space, so my Metallica t-shirt and Angelo's nose piercing and top-cum-dress was probably a bit of a shock to the business suited and booted diners already there as we sashayed in. Did I care, not a bit. Sling it.We settled down at our tiny table and started with a half dozen Colchester rock oysters to share. Lush. For main course, Angelo had salmon cutlet with braised Belgium endives and orange emulsion. He was happy with the portion size and taste. I went for the grilled wild jumbo prawns with spinach, garlic and chilli and OMG they were huge. It was literally like you were having lobster meat from its shell. Mutant big. That said, \u00a329.00 is still a bit steep for two of 'em. In terms of wine, I have no idea what we had, as I trusted Virgile, their Sommelier. Now these wine experts can be quite intimidating. They have been known to make you feel like an idiot when you don't know when to sniff, when to swish and when to spit out - but Virgile had the friendliest face ever and was really helpful on the wine descriptions. I wanted dry and light, Angelo wanted sweet and full bodied. We got exactly what we wanted. Please, can all Sommeliers be like Virgile?Apparently downstairs in the Grand Cafe is where you get snippets of Germany with hot dogs and the like. I don't think I missed out too much on that.Overall, German Gymnasium is not a casual weekly dining destination for me. The slightly uptight style in the restaurant and its pricieness, makes it more of a special occasion place to impress the folks. I would be keen to check out the cocktail bar though, as that looked really inviting.",

I was eating mostly vegetarian type meals while in London, but the GG Eggs Benedict sounded too appealing to pass up. I opted for a single which turned out to be more than enough food; the base was not an English muffin, but a potato R\u00f6sti (similar to a dense hash brown cake.) The delicate Black Forest ham & impossibly light hollandaise sauce were obviously quality ingredients. I asked for fried instead of a poached egg. This was a deliciously satisfying dish. We shared a refreshing chia parfait with mango & coconut flavors, which was a nice alternative to a heavy dessert. I'd highly recommend GG, and that you make an advance booking instead of wingin' it like we did! The bright, open space is modern, beautiful, & inviting, and the staff treated us very well. Go here next Sunday!",

    "text": "German food is not very welcoming to vegetarians, unfortunately. Would rather stick to drinks here than meals, given the options.I came here for a work lunch - we had a reservation so I can't say much about waiting times. Even on a Thursday I think getting a reservation was wise based on how crowded it was.I decided to go for the only thing I could eat - the special white asparagus. I'm an asparagus fan but I'm particular about how it's cooked. If you overdo it, the asparagus will be limp and shred when you try to cut it or bite it. Given that it's specially imported and expensive, I was hoping for something better.While German Gymnasium is listed as pricey, I found the drink prices very reasonable. I've visited the outdoor bar and enjoyed it very much.",

On the second occasion my food - a ravioli was undercooked. This was annoying as I really had wanted to like the place.",

    "text": "I'd booked us in for 12:15 lunch before our train to Cambridge from King's Cross. \u00a0When the restaurant called us, we were running really late. They promised to hold our table for us, but they said that due to bookings we would have to leave by 2:15. This worked for us and when we arrived, and saw the queue outside, we realised how nice they were to hold on to our table.We ordered the plain & gianduja croissants to start with. Not as buttery as we remembered from last weeks visit to France, but quite nice never-the-less.I had the schnitzel & he had the eggs benedict. I loved my schnitzel. My dish was supposed to come with potato dauphinoise or something, but my eye had been caught by the truffle mashed potatoes which were a side on another main. When I asked if it would be possible to change my potato side dish, the server was very helpful & the mashed potatoes were amazing.For dessert I had the hazelnut praline which was sugary but amazing for a nutella / ferrerro addict like me. He had the healthier carrot & chia seed cake with cream cheese which was good on its own, but when he tasted my azelnut praline, he didn't want to eat any more of the carrot cake. LOL.Despite reaching quite late (about 1pm), we had all 3 courses and were out by 2:15 without feeling in the least bit rushed.The service was lovely and efficient. Food, coffee, cocktails were great. Would love to go back when we had more time to sit down and explore more options on the menu.",

    "text": "Saturday Brunch in London!...Its so hard to find places if you are booking last minute or coming to the door, however this place is great for that.The brunch is served in the Grand Cafe part of this unique and historic building (apparently used for the German Olympic team back in the 40's London Games) and it is so beautiful inside!...Probably one of the nicest places I have ever had brunch in a restaurant that so little have heard ofThe food itself is amazingly good value for money with the brunches between \u00a311-\u00a316 but good portions and fresh food. You can also have really nice German pastries and Beers (German beer being the best in the world!) I had the GG Brunch which came with eggs how you want, crispy bacon, toast and german sausages. But there are also German style brunches based more on the typical German meats and breads tooOnly reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is that its still not as good as the Breakfast Club based solely on Brunch. Its a nice place for a couple to go or a group of friends and its nice and bright inside, friendly and attentive staff and just happpppyyyyyy times!Going to go again for sure! Maybe this time for dinner....",

    "text": "Excellent sausage action at this former gym. We shared what was ostensibly a fancy version of sausage and mash. Dauphinois-esque potatoes, two pork sausages and curled crispy onion (if I remember rightly). Fresh mint tea was, well, fresh and served in elegant gleaming teapots. We were confused yet amused by one of our waiters. He was definitely on the quirky end of the scale, dancing along to the beats pumping outside. It was a warm afternoon, so we didn't want to be sat indoors. But venturing in for the toilet, I can see this venue would really dazzle for a swanky dinner. The interiors are huge and impressive and totally la di da. As a result, it's relatively pricey so I'd love to try it in the evening for a few drinks or three course meal (preferably if someone else is paying).",
