Despite this blatant appeal to naff stereotypes, it actually sort of works. OK, I've never been to a restaurant that was this French-looking in actual France, but the food was genuinely great, and affordable, and the waiters were nice, and they didn't make a fuss about us turning up really late on Friday night or ordering tap water (as well as wine, of course!). In many ways, better than an actual French bistro.",

    "text": "One of very few places if any, one can get a roast dinner late on a Sunday evening in a large party in the area it seems. First if all I understand, a tough ask.Over half a dozen of us went for the lamb roast and one, the last well, very well cooked beef of the day respectively, another had steak and shoestring fries and one more the rabbit casserole. We all were singing in unison that for the value it was very agreeable eatings. The Bordeaux was also appreciated by all and the after coffee wasn't bad either. Yes. Very good value. However, not massively keen on the gravy slathered over the plate pre-service no doubt it was \u00a0perhaps to mask the late serving of the meat and its potential dryness and we were all severed with half a Yorkshire, odd. But again maybe it was as they'd run out. We all very much enjoyed our evening here and the variety of traditional Gallic offerings suited a large groups' varying desires. I as always can never finish my dinner but please dear catering gods, let me pour my own condiments and give me a whole Yorkshire pudding, or I'll throw the half I have out of my pram well I'd rather go without. I would like to try the a la Carte another time, the non Sunday menu did look very appealing.",

The experience got of to a good start when I called and spoke to a gentleman by the name of (pronounced) Saeed to book my table. He was friendly and accommodating so that was nice. I wanted a quick meal so I skipped strait to the main course and ordered the Toulouse sausages. When they arrived they seemed as though they had been cooked, refrigerated and then re-cooked once more. They had a fried frozen bread texture which I'm pretty confident is not part of their flavour. The mash and Dijon sauce they came with was delicious. I ended with an espresso, it was fine.I think food like this from a restaurant that's open to the public is unacceptable quiet honestly and thats why I've given this restaurant 2 stars, and even then I think i'm being generous. If the service during my meal had been better I would consider giving La Petite Auberge a better score. I'm not sure i'll be returning so there is little chance they'll have the opportunity to change my mind :(Although the prices are fairly low so is the value for money, that's why i've given it a high price rating.",

Their prawn and vodka starter, steak and mussels are gluten free (but of course always check with the waiter as recipes can change). So it's a great choice for a meal if you have friends with Coeliac Disease or gluten intolerance. Waiting staff are very attentive and happy to confirm if dishes contain gluten. They don't fob you off about which sauces contain flour etc. A BIG plus is that they remember you each time you visit to it's a great way to feel good about supporting small restaurants and ensuring you get to eat out without getting 'glutened'. Great wine list. Oozes French atmosphere so perfect if you can't afford that break to Paris! Whisk your over half to Le Petit Auberge instead! Try and bag a table at the top section of the restaurant as the ones on the ground floor can sometimes feel a little cramped especially when it gets busy. You can easily have two courses and a great bottle of vino all for two people for less than \u00a360. Must Try: the mussels they are amazing! *Tip only try them when there is a R in the month.",

It's casual, romantic, quirky and charming, and the best of all, it won't dent your bank account either. I recently went there with a party of 12 for a wedding reception and the staff were attentive and friendly, catering \u00a0to our every need. We all had starters, mains and copious bottles of wine (we kinda lost count) and our total \u00a0bill came in under \u00a3300! I couldn't believe it. The portions are really generous and the flavors and ingredients are everything you'd want and expect from french country cooking. If you're hungry, I'd seriously recommend the Sausage & Duck Cassulet special ( be warned: it's massive and not for the faint hearted!) or the Coq A Vin -- one of the best i've ever had. Their wine list is varied and reasonable \u00a0-- we had a kick as Pinot Grigio -- and their desserts are decadent. They do a fantastic lunch and dinner special as well where you get 3 courses for \u00a312 (lunch) or \u00a0\u00a321 (dinner), but it's quite a bit of food so go hungry!",

I lived in France for a few years, have dated French men and have eventually become a \"Chateau-neuf du Pape\" snob, but I think this place really had the best food I've had in a long time. Really.The appetiser was amazing. I love it when appetisers are actually appetising! We had frog legs in a creamy sauce that was just as good as what you can get in Lyon. Then the meal was just as good with just the perfect size proportions that are between British and French sizes.The flavors of the meat and fish where both full (and not overcooked!) and delicious. Our service was great. The place was quaint. The price was not bad. I did feel like it was a bit of a touristy setup, but yes, obviously, it's not a real French cottage.One SLIGHT, bad note. The calvados was not well-aged. I believe it was only 5 years old. I mean...this sort of stuff should not be served, especially not to a crowd that is not from Normandy, unless it's well-aged. Grand-p\u00e8re jean michel could probably handle it, but to the untrained palate, it's quite disastrous. Still, it was by far the best place I have eaten so far in London.",

The place is popular, and it's easy to understand why, with a well-priced menu serving french bistro classics (plus vegetarian options) in a relaxed atmosphere. The decor (and some of the menu items: frogs' legs? really?) tends towards the 'Allo 'Allo end of the French-ness spectrum, but the sub-\u00a310 3 course prix fixe lunch menu makes up for it. A la carte ordering won't break the bank either. Not being in a hurry, the service was pleasantly shambolic on my visit, apparently due to new staff and the unexpectedly busy weeknight. I'm sure it'll improve. And watch out for the hothouse microclimate on the upper level - it can feel like you're stuck on the central line up there!",

I would say not for the couple sitting at the bottom of the stairs, literally. This restaurant can cater for large groups, we were a bunch of 12, so can you imagine us going up and coming down, and plus bathroom visits, brushing pass this poor couple. Not pleasant and kind of feel bad. The next annoying thing was the wine, we keep chasing and chasing for the French Malbec, and when it did come no apology. Wine was average. Argentina 1-0A'last the food. I did enjoyed the food, although I question some of the courses on the menu. It a fairly big menu, with quite a large variety, normally not a good sign. I noticed some of my friends having steak and chips, it looked the most boring unappetising pan fried steak and chips I have seen, no garnish, no finesse. I had the frog legs, the mussels and the lamb shank on mash and dessert healthy pancake, which is just less sweeter and instead of ice cream, its Greek yogurt. I have to say it was quite good, food came out quick and tasted just splendid. All said the venue is nice , with great ambience and cool decor and its located in the heart of Angel. Beside the cramming of tables and chairs, they can cater for large groups, served decent food at reasonable prices and the service beside the wine was on point. I am being mean, it was extremely busy. Bon appetite.",

Menu said there was an egg in there...no egg in site. I was starving so forced myself to eat half but couldn't finish the rest and felt queasy the rest of the night. My friend had the campaniard crepe and the chicken tasted chewy and old as well as the tomato sauce very watery.The sweet crepes were easy enough and tasted ok, nothing spectacular.

    "text": "Have been here twice now and this is the final verdict.Best: sweet crepes are heavenly! they have a large variety of nuts, fruits, ice cream, and so many sweet toppings! The belgium dark chocolate was to die for.OK: Atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Waiters were all very pleasant and helpful. Mussels and savory crepe were both solid because of the tomato-based sauce, nothing special.Meh: starters & lamb shank were mediocre. well cooked but seriously lacking in taste. They also forgot about our coffee for awhile, my latte tasted like straight milk and the cappuccino was burnt.They no longer make chocolate souffle but its still on the menu.",

    "text": "Upper Street is a virtually continuous strip of eating and drinking establishments, making a random choice of one or the other nearly as bad as a Brick Lane curry house pick.With just over an hour to spare before a gig at the nearby Islington Assembly Hall, we plumped for La Petit Auberge on exterior vibe alone, as it looked busy, but not rammed full on a Friday night, with a Parisian bistro aesthetic clearly on show.After we quickly caught the attention of the maitre'd, we were shown to a suitable table in the centre of the ground floor, decorated with the expected chequered tablecloths. Other tables were really quite close to us - it's a bit of a squeeze, requiring the waiters to be swift and sure as they shoot past.The service was very good - the menus and drink choices were out of the way within five minutes, followed by the main dish order - just what we were hoping for.As we waited for our dishes to arrive, the remaining seats in the place were quickly filling up - it's clearly a very popular location.Within 15-20minutes of sitting down, the mains duly arrived and I was delighted with my duck confit. It was a generous dish, well cooked and accompanied by carrot mash and jus. Once we'd finished, the payment was also quickly handled, no doubt incentivised by the growing queue in the bar area. Good value too - two dishes and a carafe of red wine for just over \u00a340.A very satisfying choice.",

    "text": "Pretty good French restaurant in the heart of Angel. They were able to accommodate a large group of us, despite being exceptionally busy. Their French fare was spot on, I had an aubergine with cheese gratin which was huge and very filling. The restaurant was packed, reflecting that others were having a similar experience I think. The service was great, catering to our desire to imbibe copious amounts of alcohol. And the price point was quite palatable as well. Will definitely be back, and would not hesitate to take a friend there.",

The food was delicious - I had sausages and mash potato, right sized portion too. Amazing, for 3 of us & a bottle of wine it only came to \u00a352 - definitely a bargain for such good quality food. Overall, definitely recommend for somewhere slightly different to go in angel.",

Maybe I'm overly picky, but I ordered the bread basket to start and it came with cold packets of butter. I only expect to see cold packets of butter on an airplane, and at least on an airplane I can leave it on top of the hot main to melt a little before spreading. The duck confit was a big portion but nothing special. I did, however, enjoy the crepe for dessert!",

The menu had something for everyone and the set menu offered a nice variety for a reasonable cost. I have since returned for a friend's special birthday meal, a romantic date night, and a few times on own to work my way through their incredible cr\u00eape menu.The food is rich and tasty; good portions offered for really reasonable prices. The atmosphere is rustic and romantic and the service has always been warm and friendly.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this place for about 2-3 yrs. it's just had a total refurbishment after buying the shop next door.Firstly the new restaurant looks awesome, it's kept the old French style decor but it's double the size. They have used the new space for more seating and also added a small cafe area which serves coffees and crepes. Brilliant idea.!The food is lovely, I had mussels to start with a cream and vegetable sauce and rib eye steak with chips for mains. Steak was cooked just wright. My girlfriend had duck in a French style sauce which looked lovely. The menu also consists of many traditional French courses I.e snails, frog legs. The portions are perfect and the service was very quick considering the restaurant was 85% full. The prices are good given the restaurant is in a nice part of islington, North London. \u00a313 for the rib eye steak I will defo be returning.!!!!!",

    "text": "I finally made it to La Petite Auberge for dinner last night after the restaurant had been lingering near the top of my list of Islington restaurants to try. There were a few diners on Monday night but it was by no means crowded, and we were seated right away on the upper level. They offer a \u00a321.95 3-course set menu if you are really hungry, but that was too much for a Monday so we decided to order a la carte instead. My friend and I ordered the fried camembert to share, and some bread to go with it, though I feel like a French restaurant should automatically provide bread for the table. Anyway, I adore baked brie and I thought that the fried camembert would be something similar, but I found it rather disappointing and it tasted more like festival food to me (where they try to fry up anything and everything). They only gave us two slices, served with jelly, and I feel like it would have been better off with a side salad or something to cut through the richness. For a main, I ordered the poulet farci and my friend went with a coq au vin, both served with sides of garlic potatoes. I enjoyed my dish, and the potatoes as well, and it was a solid meal but nothing more. For French cuisine on Upper Street, I would prefer either of the Le Mercury locations, for great food, low prices, and better atmosphere.",

Our servers were caring (when we left one was actually concerned because I'd eaten so little of my meal - but I'd been sampling everyone else's at the table) and prompt, and the prices very reasonable. All of our portions were generous except for the grilled calamari (4 little pieces) and delicious!We'll definitely revisit.",
