The menu has a selection of singapore noodles, indonesian dishes and chinese dishes. The portions are also excellent- you can get a very large plate of noodles for under \u00a34- although I believe they may have brought in a minimum spend now. Cheeky I know but the service in this place is laughable- literally. It has actually felt like they have thrown the plate at me sometimes, yet something about it just adds to the character and you don't seem to mind so much when you are getting such good value for money. They also offer a small selection of foreign beers and some nice fruit shakes.",

The dishes are truly excellent - I've yet to pick a duffer, but the Pad Thai, salted ribs and spicy chicken noodles are among the best. Many will be put off by the fact it is located smack bang in the middle of the gay village (and there is no denying the pink pound makes up a lot of Tuk Tuk's turnover) - but this is Soho after all, and anything goes!! On the downside, the furnishings are clinical, the staff a bit surly and you soon get the hint when it's time to pay up and leave if its busy. Don't waste your money on an overpriced KFC in the West End - come here instead - you won't regret it believe me!",

The quality does seem to have suffered a bit since it has moved to Old Compton Street, but I can only assume that is because of how busy it has become. Still, it's position now means that it's great for a bite to eat before going on to a bar or club and the fact that it's always full when I visit is testament to it's popularity. I love the pad Thai here, which costs around \u00a34.50 for a huge portion. Don't expect much in the way of service though, they barely manage a rushed 'thankyoubye' as you're leaving and I've lost count of the number of times my card has been returned to my (male) partner even though I was the one paying! Still, good food for an unbeatable price in this area.",

I found out that Tuk Tuk sold Tom Yum (or tom yam? same thing though) so I got it for takeaway. Service was very quick and the man was kind and helpful. Be prepared for a 50p charge if you use card for orders under \u00a310, though. I didn't mind that at all, just wanted to eat!! I got home and got all ready. They packed the noodles separately which I appreciated, so that they wouldn't be soggy. I enjoyed the soup, though it's not the best tom yum I've ever had. I'll definitely keep looking, but I am glad to be able to get such quick service for a reasonable price (and loads of noodles :D)",

As the name promises it serves all kinds of Asian noodle dishes. I am hardly ever in Central London during the week at lunch time and why oh why did I not just queue at Koya? Well, too late for regrets, just don't make the same mistake as me and do keep away from this restaurant. Around this time of the year with temperatures around freezing I need to eat noodle soup all the time to survive. (Even though I am Austrian and I should be used to the cold I think I am rather meant for tropical temperatures). So I opted for the TomYum Soup with chicken. I usually love the hot and sour flavours of Tom Yum soup, it really warms you from within. The Tuk Tuk version was not hot but too sour. I would have forgiven this for the price (3.90) but what I could not forgive was the fact that the chicken was so tough that I nearly lost a tooth (and mind you, I have remarkably good teeth). I have seriously never in my entire life come across chicken so absolutely inedible. The chicken disaster is not the only negative thing I have to point out. The restaurant smelled weird, of a mixture of toilet cleaner and something more unpleasant. The service was hostile. I only got a hint of a smile when I left Well, they won't see me return :)",

Where's with Mr Woo you would visit once and then stay clear for a couple of years, Tuk Tuk is a quality establishment.  If your not keen on the idea of buffet, then fear not, there is a normal menu to choose from. But don't be greedy like I once was and order 4 different dishes, as the portions are large and you will struggle getting through them all.

The chicken was of the breaded kind, which leads me to believe this chicken is used in their other dishes such as lemon chicken too.

Must order rice separately.Encouragingly, their food is served very, very hot, leading me to believe they make everything to order.Enjoy!",

At the end of a recent trip I was hungry and announced to the group....my dinner budget is \u00a34. Seriously.Tuk Tuk was quickly decided as my nose wrinkled at the sound of road side chips. First impressions, I'll be honest, shoddy. I am a snob and had my pals not insisted I'd have spun around and headed to BK or summit.I slumped down, verging on sulking and opened the menu. Prices were ridic!! So cheap. And having decided on the same as Huddy, I had a noodle soup veggie soup thingy and a tap water. \u00a33.90 later I am laughing with joy at how delishously full I am and that I spent less than I would in KFC. Food arrived super fast and was scrummy.Plus sat next to me was Lucy from x-factor 2009 AND Owen from Enders was behind me. Can't be the hole I thought it was!!",

Uh, YES please! Located in the heart of soho, if you can make it here before they close, you will not be disappointed. The special fried rice is pretty darn memorable too.Usually the service is amazingly fast, but this last time it must have been amateur night in the kitchens because there was a period of close to 20 minutes when NO food was being brought out and people were getting annoyed. Otherwise, excellent place to eat on the cheap and people watch drunk crazies. :)",

My dinner guest got the green curry, and it was just average. With the curry, you have to pay for the rice separately but our waiter did not mention this; luckily we saw it on the menu.All in all, it's fairly cheap and faster than the average restaurant, but I will most likely never come here again.",

It's also right across the street from my current favourite bubble tea place so you can have a delicious meal and grab some tea for dessert. For the price you get a nice portion of food. I was actually surprised considering this is right in the heart of Soho but I'm not complaining. Great for an (international) student budget. The noodles here are the best. I've had both the Singaporean style fried vermicelli which is awesome if you like heat. My favourite is the Chicken green curry with egg fried rice; mild and creamy, highly recommend. The chicken was cooked really well and I liked the flavour of the green curry. The fried rice was also nice and moist, just rice and egg so it's very simple. Everything on the menu looks really good, I can't wait to come back and try more!",

    "text": "This place is listed as a Thai restaurant. But it's really not. They have a smattering of Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese and even some Chinese food. The prices are low, 5 pounds or so. But the quality and quantity is also mediocre. I had some Pad Thai. It wasn't really enough so I had another order of soup noodles. \u00a0So my meal ended up being 12 or 13 lbs, vs. the 7 or 8 lbs that I thought I signed up for. \u00a0If you're really not that hungry and just want a light bite in the neighborhood, this place works. If you want a proper meal, probably not. \u00a0By the way the staff is all Chinese.",

Unfortunately it was rather watered down so had lost its 'oomph'. Oh well, next time we'll try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "For about \u00a311 per person you could order the set meal for two: soup, an appetizer platter, steamed rice, green chicken curry, stir fried vegetables, and beef with garlic sauce = quite a bargain! Although it was a bargain and we had variety for our meal, the quality was lower than expected. The appetizer platter included stale/old sides, not fresh at all. The spare ribs were dry, the fish cakes were stale, but the eggrolls were decent. The soup was fulfilling = mushrooms, cilantro, spicy/sour broth. The green chicken curry was decent but the other two plates were way too salty. I had mixed feelings about our meal because we had a chance to try a little bit of everything but the quality was on a seesaw scale. Hate to burst your bubble but this is a Thai restaurant run by Chinese people.",
