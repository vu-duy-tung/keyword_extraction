The twinkly lights there make it feel like it's a special occasion no matter when you go. I love everything there, from the grissini and (real!) butter they place on your table instead of bread to the fried zucchini to their homemade pastas.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE STAFF ATTITUDE - good food Booked by phone, hostess insisted abou 5 times that I give my surname rather then first name. Only when she saw that I might change my mind and take another restaurant, she accepted the booking.Arrived at 8pm on a Saturday evening. Cute restaurant, nice atmosphere though half empty on a Saturday night in the heart of Chelsea, atmosphere looked promising. Been sat on a nice table, not too close to the neighbour, breadbasked on the table already. Bread dry and not definitely not home made, grissini sticks nice touch and the olive butter heavenly. Only when the menus arrived we saw that the breadbasked was \u00a3 1.80 per person. Don't mind paying for it, but in this case I felt cheated.Good menu with promising dishes. Food was excellently prepared. Description of the wine was lousy, did not reach to the expectations.Waiters were something between 30 and 60 yo. Normally you'd expect a great service from people that age (like the guys in La Brasserie in South Ken), but there was no interaction at all, most of them looked horribly grumpy.For main I ordered grilled Sardines and after having had in Italy many times grilled Sardines, I expected small fish with soft bones, where bones were no problem. The waiter took the order without any comment. Fish arrived, 3 big fish, about 15 to 20 cm. Full of bones, very difficult to eat. After giving it a go with the first fish, I gave up and called the waiter. Explained to him that these fish are impossible to eat. In a very friendly tone. He took a snotty look at me, said he will call his colleague. An old gentleman came, asked me what the problem was. I explained, he kept interrupting me, told me that I am wrong, I didn't have Sardines in Italy, their way is the only way to prepare Sardines. He didn't want to have my feedback and I insisted that he takes the fish back as even after filleting it correcly myself it was still inedible. Again a snotty look and he took the plate away without so much as a sorry. The attitude of the hostess, the snotty waiter, the attitude of that old guy who wasn't able at all to handle complaints completely spoiled the dinner for me. We wanted to have desserts and as usual coffees after dinner but after this poor experience we just paid the bill (2 starters, 2 mains, breadbasket, water, half bottle wine \u00a3 67) and left. Of course, they did not remove the fish (\u00a3 10) from the bill.What a shame. Good food, nice decor but we will certainly no go back and this is due to the attitude of the staff. The restaurant is around for already 40 years but it was half empty on a Saturday night.",

The duck flavoured with the delicious sweet sauce for the main was also outstanding. There is generally a good variety of pasta and other meat dishes on offer too. And the tiramisu for desert was truly exceptional, producing sweet overtones at just the right level. And while the general setting is fairly simple, as one would often find in family run Italian restaurants, the quality of the food and the attitude of the very friendly staff generate a very pleasant atmosphere. Overall, this place is probably among the best one can find for high class authentic Italian cuisine.",

We are greeted with a smile, taken to a table even without a booking and from then everything goes well, great service, nice table, nice traditionnal decor with pictures of the Family hung on the white walls all in white and blue tones, and fantastic food. The menu is classic Italian Trattoria (no pizza) with strong influence from Tuscany: great pasta (I recommend the wild boar pappardelle), meat (rabbit is great) and fish (sea bass). This is a wonderful place for a family lunch over the weekend, particularly if you have young children - they will be very welcome and feel at home. In the summer they have a great terrasse at the back which feels like being away in the South. Not exactly cheap but fair for the food and location (lunch for 2 plus 2 children was \u00a3100). Good for a romantic evening or a dinner with another couple of friends too.",

Well that's how I felt going to this place. First WARNING sign: there are no prices on the online menu.

Then he proceeded to undress my friend with his eyes. Seriously.The menu offers you pretty much all of the items you can think of when you close your eyes and think of Italy. The pasta in a 'large' size is not really that large and will set you back around \u00a314-16. It's well cooked and flavoursome but lack some serious colour/herbs/anything green. The risotto was nice. Actually everything was nice. But nice in a cafe on a high street way, not in a fine dining way and you are paying borderline fine dining prices. Meal highlight: we got a whole bowl of cheap packet parmesan to sprinkle as we please over our meals. To be fair, the wine list does offer a lot of wines between \u00a320-25, but they a little on the pub wine style of things. Meanwhile, they have a dessert cart.",

    "text": "La Famiglia strikes me as a place that was once a London hot spot. It has the charm of an authentic / cheesy Italian restaurant, and the servers all have an incredible amount of character and couldn't be nicer!As for the food, we got two dishes, spicy tomato penne and pappardelle with wild boar sauce - both were fine, but not impressive. The black olive spread served with the bread was delicious, but the bread was a bit boring.Another knock was the cover charge that showed up on our bill - I can never understand why I am paying a cover when we are paying for our meal. One other plus in addition to the service was that they do offer a few gluten-free pasta options.",

    "text": "I like La Famiglia far more than I should. They have 2 'rooms'. \u00a0One, a normal if slightly tired front space, and the other, a heated tent. \u00a0The front is reserved for regulars and the ghosts of celebrities who used to frequent many many years ago, but whose legacy is rememberd freshly by the staff (who behave as if it is still a haunt of these long dead, long forgotten celebs).Food is really quite excellent for a neighbourhood Italian, and if the plating and presentation were improved perhaps would be fine enough to be served somewhere 'good'. \u00a0However, the tent room is a dump and the servers are utter assholes. \u00a0It's reasonably cheap, and the food is good.Go, but expect to be treated like shit, and if you're anything like me, be a complete prick back to them, and enjoy the animosity (and the very good food).",

    "text": "I've never ever in all my experiences had a server as accommodating who went above and beyond, and also the food was really very good. I dined with my aunt who is allergic to both Garlic and Onions, which makes it close to impossible to find dishes without either so there's always some sort of negotiating that has to happen. That being said, she's pretty flexible. But I digress, she ordered a salad and didn't like some of the ingredients which came up to about 1/3 of the salad. The waiter came by noticed she hadn't eaten all her salad and offered to bring her more greens and more of what she liked. Then our starters came out. I had the boar pasta which was divine. It tasted like a dish someones grandmother spent all day preparing. I then split the boar meat dish with my hubby. I wasn't wild about it, but it was cooked perfectly and it the accompanying side dish was lovely. By then I was in boar overload and he ate most of it. Also, I did have a glass of the house red and it was pretty good too.",

    "text": "I have very mixed feelings. Positive: - The people are typical (as far as I am concerned) Italians. I quite like that. they were really nice and I think the service is good. They seemed a bit stressed but it was Valentine's Day so I am guessing they had a lot to do.- The restaurant itself is nice. It is not too posh and we felt really comfortable. - Desert (Canoli) was delicious.Negative- Table is really small- Portions were really small- They charge for all the stuff they put on the table (bread, olive paste, and they include a service charge, per person)Just FYI: For two mains a bottle of wine (middle range) one starter and one desert we paid \u00a381. Food was alright but not special. I am not going back there. Too expensive for what it is.",

    "text": "It's been said on the grapevine that this is the best Italian restaurant in London. Since I haven't tried them all, I'm going to withhold judgement. Even so, it's a pity that I don't live in Chelsea so that I can call La Famiglia my second kitchen. It's delightfully Italian, warm and inviting inside. It offers simple and classic dishes but there's not need to embellish a good thing. It definitely gets crowded in the evenings, so booking is advised. La Famiglia is tucked slightly away from the main street so you'll need to keep your eyes open for it. The pastas are good, the red wines are perfect but the best part is the dessert cart Oh my, the sweets! If you're looking for a cosy, charming, and inviting Italian place for a relaxing Sunday dinner with friends full of good friend and drink, come to La Famiglia.",

The menu is fresh, seasonal yet extensive. Everyone will find something that suits their taste, and walk away replete and satisfied. I highly recommend their specials, and dinning in the patio in the summer.",

So when he finally took me I was really impressed with the quality of the food, the friendly service, and atmosphere. On a nice sunny day, its perfect to sit outside underneath the blue/white striped umbrellas. Most of the customers are from the Chelsea neighborhood, so you won't find any tourists here!The service really reminds me of my time in Italy - just very personable and friendly guys who are all related to eachother somehow. Some highlights - lobster pasta, fried battered mozaarella, sea bass (very fresh!!), and pretty much all the dessert. I also like the olive tapenade that they give you in the beginning with your bread and bread sticks. Great place for a nice Sunday lunch in the sun =)",

I am making myself hungry thinking about it now. The portion was gigantic. I was too full to order any dessert. My dining companions also thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I'll be back.Gluten-free notes: From time to time, this place has gluten-free pasta. Maybe call ahead to check, if you're interested. The staff knows all about gluten and are happy to advise you.",

It really does feel like a family run place and everyone makes you feel very welcome.Not too busy on a Tuesday lunchtime, so no need to book (or is this the first sign of the recession biting).The food was a little bit too rich & salty for my liking (melanzane, followed by grilled chicken with mustard sauce), my own fault for not opting for the risotto. The dessert trolley is a killer - I would love to come back for afternoon tea and try some of their cakes.",

The friend I was meeting for dinner, who has lived in Rome and knows all the best places declared this \"better than most of the restaurants you will find in Italy\".2. \u00a0When I gave the cab driver the street address, he knew right away that I was going to La Famiglia \"that's the only reason anyone goes to Langton street - it's the best Italian in the city.\"He could be right. \u00a0We sat outside on the charming back patio and drank a bottle of Tuscan wine, followed by fried zucchini and angel hair pasta with fresh shaved truffles. \u00a0It was melt in your mouth delicious, the kind where it's so good you don't even notice that you've eaten it all until it's gone. \u00a0I had calf's liver in sage sauce while my friend had scallops wrapped in bacon - both were fantastic. After I left I knew this place was a gem because part of me didn't want to Yelp it - too good to share. \u00a0But it would be criminal not to tell other foodies about this place. \u00a0Just save me a seat on the patio.",
