The entire meal was less than stellar to be quite honest, and the service wasn't great either. Plus, two pieces of fish, some fries, and a coke simply don't merit the \u00a331 bill (about $50 USD). The atmosphere was nice, and they seat you fairly quickly if you have a reservation, but overall, not impressed with the food or the price.",

    "text": "Poppies has a very nice vintage interior design that is diner style with nice wall art, which is fun to dine in. The ambiance is casual/semi-formal and the waiters and waitresses wore cute holiday costumes during the holiday season. The waitresses were not the friendliest people, and did forget about my table of 5 people, but all of our fish and chips came out of the kitchen rather quickly and they were all very delicious! I tried both the haddock and the cod with chips and in my opinion the cod had a creamier taste. The haddock was good if you would like your fish to be more fried. The portion size, if the photo is not zoomed in, looks rather small on camera, but was able to fill everyone up at the end of the meal. It's good that Poppies provides salt and pepper for people to individually season their fish because a few of my friends thought Poppies tasted rather bland. No wifi, a little pricy for fish and chips, but overall worth the go because their fish and chips did taste delicious, and the food comes out nice and quick.",

She was also just generally quite grumpy and unhelpful. The meal I just finished was bland beyond words, despite salt and vinegar. It must have been chronically underseasoned. The mouthfeel was OK (sounds weird but important in fish and chips) and the price was OK (\u00a36.50 for plaice and medium chips). But that's about it.",

The option of newspaper with your food may be the closest they \u00a0get. For my \u00a320 plus optional 12.5% service charge I had (sit down) Large Haddock, chips, mushy peas, bread and butter and a cup of tea.Haddock, nice enough \"batter\", but fish overcooked in my opinion, almost to the point of having the same texture as chicken breast. An un-PC as it may sound, not oily enough but obviously \"healthier\". \u00a0Chips, uniformly squared edges, harrumph. \u00a0The cardinal sin when serving fish and chips is NO SCRAPS., the tiny, crispy, bobbles of cooked batter that fall off the fish into the fryer. It was enjoyable, but I left really, really disappointed. \u00a0I expect I really just wanted to be in Bridlington or Filey on the east Yorkshire cost, but that was not their fault. For the price most people might prefer to go elsewhere.PS - What really brought a smile to my face, being British and of a certain age, what the single Fruit Salad and Black Jack chews with the bill.",

    "text": "I have been craving Fish and chips for a long time!!! I live in the Camden area and always thought that the place lacked a true \"British\" fish and chip shop. So when I found out about Poppies I couldn't wait to get in there. The venue looks the part and I like the small attention to detail. Waitresses were very keen to serve, but I couldn't help but think that this was because they must have had twice the amount required! We were attended to by at least 3 different people, all keen to be doing anything other than standing about looking pretty. The fish and chips can't really be faulted; the fish was fresh and the batter light. The chips were chunky and not at all soggy. \u00a0The food was served in a timely manner (as you would expect for fish and chips!). Portions were adequate, but I am used to finding a decent portion of chips a challenge so in truth I would have wanted more on the plate)My main issue with Poppies is the price!!! We ended up with a bill of \u00a330(ish)..... For fish and chips!!! My local chippy in Hampshire has me smiling and content for under a \u00a310 so why I need to pay three times the amount for the pleasure of the same meal in Camden I am unsure. Recommend it if you need your FnC fix, but in honesty as is the current fad in London... traditional foods shouldn't be over priced just because you package the venue a bit nicer.",

It's cheaper and quicker if you go to the takeout section through the side door, and there are seats outside for takeout customers. A lot of the reviews of this place are about the decor and atmosphere, but since I only had takeout this review will be strictly for the food. I had the haddock; my fiancee had the cod. Both were excellently prepared and cooked perfectly. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the chips as I'm more used to crispy french fries, but my fiancee seemed to like them. I also tried the battered sausage...skip that. Stick with fish.

With all the hype and awards, I was totally expecting some spectacular! You know what's coming up next. I arrived and it had barely opened so it was pretty empty. Made my way upstairs and was seated. Essentially it's just fried fish or other fried seafood and chips (fries for us in the States). We asked the waitress for suggestions and portion sizes decided on the larger sizes and different types of fish. We also ordered an assortment of drinks, one of which was really good was the ginger beer. I love ginger beer and this was actually really good and I would order it again.As for the actual fish and chips dishes, the large portion was way larger than the waitress told us. Great that we got more food but we could've done without ordering two orders which meant we were left with a ton of leftover fish and chips. Regardless of which type of fish we chose, the flavor was about the same. I say it was a bit bland and more breaded that I had hoped. The chips were fluffy and decent but way too many spuds for my liking. We also got an order of the Chicken Pie which is pretty much a Chicken Pot Pie with chips on the side as well. A lot smaller than expected and about the same price as the huge plates of fish...I don't know why...The pie was also not hot enough and wasn't very flavorful as well.Coming back to the service. The waitress first told us the portions were a lot smaller than they actually were. Next, they were not very attentive throughout our meal and did not come by to ask how things were. They did clean up the table very quickly but that was it. In terms of the check, they were also quick with that... I wonder why. Service as a whole was mediocre.I was utterly disappointed at Poppies. They are supposed to be award winning but I felt that there must be other places that had better fish and chips and better service. Sadly, we left the restaurant super full, with empty pockets because the plates were relatively expensive, and wishing we had the little stalls of street food nearby instead...",

When we arrived, there was no wait for a table and there was plenty of seating. I ordered the large fish (cod) and chips with a side of mushy peas. I was told that the mushy peas is also a local classic with fish and chips. The fried fish was huge!!! I loved the sauce that came with the fish and the portions were large. Yum...delicious!",

    "text": "The best fish and chips we have had in London -- hands down! The vintage vibe here is cool and fun too.They serve 2 kinds of fish here, haddock and the traditional cod. Both are sourced sustainably, but to my taste the haddock was more flavourful and delicious.Both cod and haddock were fried perfectly in a light crispy batter and served piping hot. Mushy peas were better than most, but we would he likes some mint in them for a bit of zing. We think Poppies compared very favorably to The Golden Hind, but the superior flavour of the haddock at Poppies nipped the old Marylebone High Street institution.",

After bleeding and showing the waiter the bits of glass I couldn't of course eat more, scared that it would happen again so I asked for the bill. To my surprise, we were charged for the whole thing and when I said it didn't seem very fair that I was being charged for that portion of fish & chips, a different waitress said she could give me a discount. Now, explain to me how giving me a discount on a regular fish & chip meal (\u00a312) pays for the damage done to the inside of my mouth. So after saying this they took off one of the meals from the bill but I don't understand how it is possible that a restaurant with such a good rating that claims to be \"the best fish & chip restaurant in the country\" serves chips with glass in them and doesn't take responsibility for it. I can assure you I won't be coming back and I will never recommend this place to anyone.",

In fact, generally when I go to a fish & chip restaurant I go for the seafood platter so that most of the food isn't covered in batter. At Poppies I was concerned because their seafood platter was all in batter - what would I eat? In the end I went for the scampi (which comes in batter rather than the breadcrumbs I am used to) and hoped it would be ok. I was I have to say very pleasantly surprised. The batter on the scampi was light and crispy, reminiscent of tempura batter and the chips were delicious. The only downside is that if you want peas or salad you have to buy those as extras making the already a little pricy cost even higher. All in all though a very enjoyable meal.",

Even at 2pm on a weekday, it was pretty busy but I luckily got a spot because I was by myself.I got the cod and it came with a ton of chips (fries). The cod was nicely fried with a crispy outside and a flaky, tender inside. My only complaint was that there was absolutely no seasoning, not even salt. I guess that's what the condiments were for. The fries were pretty good but they weren't as crispy on the outside as I would hoped, but really fluffy inside. Overall, I had to season everything myself but it was a pretty well made meal and would recommend the fish!",

The location of Poppies may somewhat seem hidden, but the signs that it has put on the streets definitely helped me navigate towards the restaurant. On to the food... Even though I only got the kid's lunch, I still thought the portion of this meal was just right for me. I actually wonder how big the regular sized one is if this one filled me up! The cod fish was nicely cooked with a crunchy coat. This restaurant even served its fries with a homemade ketchup sauce! It is super delicious and definitely worth a try.",

Poppies had come recommend by a local, while we where shopping in Harrods the sales associate mentioned if we'd eaten poppies yet, we said no we'd eaten at another place and we mentioned the name and she seemed to be unimpressed and said try poppies! So we did! We weren't very hungry but our prior experience with London fish and chips left us bitter as a lemon, soooo.... not very hungry but in need of a authentic London bucket list dinner, off we went! We are so glad we did! The service was excellent, great ambience a pub type feel (what I anticipated) food fish and chips we excellent mushy peas we great! Loved the beer as well was a mini mug lager, and you must save room for dessert the sticky toffee pudding is a must have! Fried fish was delicious, hot crispy and the batter was excellent came with French fries( chips) again hot and delicious, we had the cod and tried the haddock, haddock was great as well, mushy peas was delicious, I must admit I didn't know what to expect with the mushy peas however it was delicious and a perfect side for your fish and chips, it was almost like a split pea soup except the thinner consistency. Have a mini lager superb with your meal! Mind you we were NOT very hungry at all when we went, but we could not resist dessert traditional sticky toffee pudding was on our menu! We were so happy we tried it! Delicious. Over all I guess you can tell we loved poppies and the traditional London vibe. Poppies is a must due when in London, and don't worry about the cab cost, cause it is a bit of a distance when your in the typical tourist area, it's totally worth it!",

Although the fish did taste fresh, I thought that it could have used an extra kick in flavor - either with more seasoning or a dip. I'm used to having this dish with a side of tartar sauce, so the lack of it really emphasized the blandness. Meanwhile, the thick-cut chips became soggy from the vinegar that was drizzled on. They didn't have that addicting crunch you get from Mickey D's French fries.ProTip: Order take-out to avoid paying nearly double the price for your meal.",

Second, when we ordered I wanted to try the curry sauce to go with the fish, the lady said they ran out.

The atmosphere is boisterous (loud 50s music) and the employees are friendly. We chose to takeaway our order and sat outside the restaurant on the benches provided. The volume of the music isn't the issue. Even the prices are fair (for London) and the portions are more than adequate. My fish and chips both tasted fresh. So what's the issue? It's the cooking technique. Our fish was so overcooked that it had an almost rubbery texture. It wasn't inedible but it wasn't great (and a fish and chips stand should know the appropriate amount of time to cook their fish). The chips were obviously fresh but they lacked any sort of satisfying crispy crunch. I didn't flat out hate this meal but it certainly isn't something I'd go out of my way to return to or to recommend to anyone else. I think the word that sums this place up best is \"overhyped.\"",
