I think there were two tiny pieces of chicken in there. I had like three bites of it. I also ordered the crispy Peking duck side with wraps, fillings, and plum sauce. The duck was indeed crispy, but pretty dry and flavorless. I managed to eat most of that though... out of not wanting to starve!Here's the kicker, I hated seeing all that Pad Thai go to waste and thought I would at least take it home in case I was in some desperate mood one night and wanted to give it another go... I found out that they charge 50p for boxes! So I left the giant plate sitting there as I was not willing to sink even a penny more into this poor decision. :(",

One of them actually came up to the table before we were done with the bill and took it from us just to tell us that there was not enough, something we obviously knew because we were not done with it. In addition, she would not accept our legal tender just because it was not the newly printed money!!!! It was the worst dinner experience I have EVER had.I am no longer referring this restaurant as well as retracting all referrals I have given to others to ensure that they will never have to go through the horrible upon horrible dining experience I did.The next time I am in the area and I see anyone pondering whether to eat there, I will be sure to share my experience with them.",

    "text": "I would like to preface my review of Tuk Tuk with this statement:Whenever I am in London, I tend to lower my expectations when it comes to my dining experience. \u00a0It is a coping mechanism. \u00a0Everything here is expensive once one factors in the exchange rate, and with my meager budget, I can only really afford to eat at inexpensive places, which tend to serve up some bland and dull food accompanied by horrible service. \u00a0 Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me tell you what I think of Tuk Tuk:Tuk Tuk is cheap, good, and cheerful based on my London standards. The portions they serve up are generous compared to others in London. \u00a0The service, although not overly friendly, was, based on my experience, at least not surly and was even bordering on pleasant. \u00a0 Tuk Tuk IS okay. They market themselves as a Thai restaurant, but their menu consisted of a bunch of dishes that are not quite Thai. \u00a0We ordered three things: Mee Goreng, Sitr-fried vegetables, and Barbecue Spareribs. \u00a0I pondered ordering the Pad Thai, but I saw what it looked like and thought better of it (it was a large portion, but the noodles looked over-cooked, and it looked like it was covered in ketchup-y looking sauce). The mee goreng was not great but was at least edible. The egg noodles were over-cooked, \u00a0and the dish was quite bland. \u00a0The stir-fried vegetables consisted mainly of broccoli and was nothing special, but at least they were crispy. \u00a0It was okay, but I've had better-tasting sir-fried veggies at a \"Chinese\" restaurant at a local sporties club in Tennant Creek, Australia (pop 3500) where there was not one Asian cook in sight. \u00a0The spare ribs - sold as a side dish - consisted of about 3 small portions of ribs and were covered in this sickly sweet sauce, but at least the meat was tender. \u00a0All three dishes came to a total of about GBP 15 so not a bad deal for London standards.I would probably return if I were staying in Bayswater again and did not want to venture out elsewhere, but I would definitely not seek Tuk Tuk out. \u00a0If I were to rate this on Vancouver standards, I would not return. \u00a0London Standards, 3 stars; Vancouver standards: barely 2 stars.",

She does not eat meat due to religious restrictions.The staff were very unhelpful, and seemed reluctant but took it back, laughing amongst themselves and looking back at us.Soup took a long while second time around. We were on our lunch break. After getting the soup my friend could not finish it all as we had very little time left on our hour break. When asked to take it away the woman was short with us, said we had to pay 50 pence for the cup. I politely explained that my colleague could not finish her soup due to the previous error. She insisted that that was not for discussion. It is obvious that this is an establishment with 0 customer service skills and a completely unsympathetic, self righteous attitude. Not returning. Not recommending. Totally disrespectful. Not for Vegetarians.",

This one is located right outside Bayswater tube, so is often filled with people who want something quick to eat and don't bother walking up in both directions for better Chinese and even Malaysian/Singaporean (at Kiasu up the road). A place that serves such a wide variety of cuisines is going to be fairly average, though not a master at any of them so expect it to be a bit hit or miss. Having said that, if you want some quick grub at a cheap price, this is an option though I'd still steer you to the many other asian restaurants along the road.",

Maybe they should just call it \"vegetable spring rolls with some duck\" (maybe they're not generous with duck to cut down on costs???)-sriracha sauce provided on the table was very watery (probably added water to cut down on costs???) -ordered curry but was also very watery (cutting down on costs again???)-servers were literally standing around the kitchen/bar area just chit chatting. Very unprofessional. They're probably not trained in customer service. They just put your food on the table and that's it.

Had 2 rice containers, 2 large bowls of soup, beef dish, vegetable dish, calamari, chicken skewers, curry chicken. All for \u00a326. Maybe it was just take out but most of the food was not very good. The calamari was very chewy, could not finish it. Fried shrimp ball was the same. The only thing j enjoyed was the curry chicken. Everything else is not good and over fried. I would go back again but just for curry chicken.",

I mean it was so long I finished reading the rest of my book and the 4 sets of diners that were eating left prior to my receiving the bag.I got home and opened the bag and immediately my face dropped. When your thai food looks all one, homogenous color, you know there's something wrong. It was all a slightly caramel color as if they only put a splash on of soy just for color. At least they tried to give it some color period.",

The take away was out in minutes which for me showed concerns that the food may have been pre cooked. And well ..... My concerns became reality.Noodles were like rubber tyre tread and there was lucky enough to be 3 pieces of beef amongst the tired looking sprouts. Well at least I hoped it was beef. In a word .... NO !",

Only OK for some tourist that never comes again or someone who only used to eat take aways!!! Place shouldn't serve food, just drinks! I nearly got food poisoning from 1/3 noodles I managed to eat! Next table lady left her noodles untouched after trying one noodle and saying it's really bad! But I guess she was used to better food than the ordinary take away lover they prey for! Even for take away level the food is horrible, it would not survive as take away!Bill is hand written with just the total that just goes to the pocket and never to the taxman I guess, I don't know even what I paid for, just paid. Long time I haven't eat something that horrible, it's my first time to review restaurant, it's is that bad! I mean for 5 - 6 pound this noodle portion looks good deal but it's really horrible I would pay more for another place serving me good one!!! Restaurant looks OK from outside though - it's a bad trick you will regret entering :((I wish I had read reviews left before as many people complain!I had food poisoning in Chinese restaurant 6 years ago while pregnant and I had complications because of food poisoning and I forever regret I never complained and even didn't remember the name as I was tourist in that town!!! I hope this will be warning to others not to be naive like me!",

It was packed when I got there on a Sunday evening, and everytime I have walked past they have been busy. They serve a wide range of South-East asian food, although they seem to specialize in Thai and Malaysian food. Don't expect fine dining here this is a place to go for cheap grub and big plates of rice or noodles. Service is neither rude or friendly, and their only goal is to get you the food you want quickly so that you can vacate the table quickly for the next sitting. I would have given this place 3 stars if not for the fact that upon leaving the restaurant, we double-checked the menu outside and found that we were mysteriously charged an extra 2 quid for our meal! As it was a small amount we didn't bother going back to complain, but it has left a little bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "Horrible Service. Horrible Service. Horrible Service. First of all, the people who run this place are Malaysian and it definitely shows. Their food is spiced incorrectly and their noodles are overcooked. Their duck was bland and stale-tasting. Their soups are not authentic and the meat they use is obviously cheap wholesale stuff.What REALLY makes this place suck is that they have HORRIBLE SERVICE. The people that work in this restaurant were obviously born without smiling muscles as they always look angry or annoyed. I'm especially surprised with the chubby, young female. She doesn't smile at all. With all that youth you'd think she'd know how to smile.The moment I came in, I asked for a table for 1. They didn't say anything to me so I sat down at the nearest empty table, making sure to only occupy a 2-person table. Fifteen seconds later, the main server lady (let's just call her \"Angry Lady\", AL for short) says, \"No you no sit there! Sit in front!\" I say, \"I prefer to sit back here since it's cold up in the front.\" AL says, \"No, please sit in front!\" Because I was hungry and I didn't particularly want any spit in my food, I just moved.After eating my non-imaginative, pseudo-Thai food, I asked for my check and to refill my water glass (after already asking and being ignored 5 times). When I asked for my check I asked for an itemized receipt or at least a piece of paper that has what I ordered written down (for business expense purposes). Upon hearing my request, AL rolls her eyes, sighs, and storms off. She then comes back and gives me something that WASN'T what I requested. Then suddenly, AL's husband/boss/Angry Man (\"AM\") walks up and says something in Malaysian and argues right in front of me all while pointing and looking at me at the same time. AM and AL argue for a bit and finally AL finishes my itemized receipt and literally just throws it at me.I will NEVER eat here again. After this review, I don't even want to utter its name or even look at it when I pass by as looking directly into the eyes of AL and/or AM would completely kill your soul and disqualify you from eternal salvation from the god of your choice.There are better Thai places with real Thai cooks. And even if they aren't real Thai cooks, it'll still be better than this place. If not the food, then definitely the customer service.AVOID AT ALL COSTS! You have been warned.",
