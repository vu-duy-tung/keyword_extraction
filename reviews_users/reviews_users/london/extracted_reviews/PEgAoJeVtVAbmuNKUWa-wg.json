    "text": "Another soho opening, this time from the team of Cameron Emirali, formerly at the restaurant of The Wapping Project, and Luke Wilson formerly of The Ambassador. Housed on Greek Street in Soho it maybe appear from the outside to one more in a string of similar looking places but is soon revealed to have a very strong identity of its own and more of a cozy feel to it than something out of the Soho-chic interior decoration manual. The all black facade opens up on a wood dominated interior with tightly packed tables that still give ample space for dining. Two big blackboards on opposite walls announce the menu and another for the desserts. Overall very inviting and more so by the friendly and helpful staff. Starters are all \u00a35 \u00a0\u00a37 with some available as a main for around \u00a314, and most mains between \u00a315 \u00a0\u00a318. There are some truly excellent dishes to be had at 10 Greek Street like: - Potato Gnocchi, Wild Mushrooms, Parmesan & Truffle Oil (\u00a37) \u00a0a fantastic, soft, chewy gnocchi cooked to perfection mixed with wild mushrooms and then covered in parmesan and truffle oil. - Gloucester Old Spot Pork Loin, Mustard Mash and Savoy Cabbage (\u00a316) \u00a0a fair sized main presented with a quenelle of the mash on a side and a stack of pork towering above it, balanced on the cabbage. - Haunch Of Venison, Red Cabbage, New Potatoes & Quince (\u00a316) \u00a0a true highlight with the richness of the gamey venision against the slight sweetness and crunch of the red cabbage and the sweet quince. All dishes were for me, impeccably seasoned, never anything overshadowing anything else and, in my opinion, not a grain of salt needed to be added. I have enjoyed 10 Greek Street immensely both my visits and could easily see myself frequenting it.",

I am really bad at planning ahead, but I can still eat at a great restaurant last minute. However, other times, I had to give it up because it is hard to chance it here when you have more than 2 people in the group. I managed to eat there a few times and I enjoyed the everything I had. The restaurant changes the menu very frequently, so you can count on they using fresh and in-season ingredients. They usually don't have a huge menu, but there is always a few specials for the night. When everything is good, you don't need that many options, really! This is my go-to if I want to introduce a friend to a cool independent London restaurant. Well, if we managed to grab a table, that is.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. British food focused on seasonal ingredients and a daily changing menu? My cup of tea.Made reservations for a late lunch (2pm) and didn't have to wait at all. They only take bookings for lunch, which is really helpful! I picked the rare Welsh beef as a starter, and the Middlewhite pork with fondant butternut squash and cime di rapa (Italian broccoli) as a main. My friend went for the fried soft-shell crab and the calf's liver with mash as a main.For some reason, I expected my starter of rare beef to be a plate of piping hot, roast beef...what arrived was definitely far from that. It tasted fine, but it was rather underwhelming - two rather small slices of \"rare beef\" with strips of fat running through it...oh, I also had an accompaniment of beetroot and salad with it. Rather disappointing. I had high expectations for my main - Middlewhite pork is supposed to be very juicy and delicious because of the fat content. My plate arrived - looked delicious, an improvement from the previous course. When I dug in, the pork was rather dry around the edge (it was rolled into a roulade) and the spices running through the middle were bitter and a bit strange. The accompaniments were very good, and I couldn't fault the piece of pork crackling. Divine. Thankfully the centre of the \"meat roulade\" was much juicier and very tender. I had a feeling the pork was over-cooked, but I personally hate sending food back. For dessert, I went for the quince and apple crumble that came with custard. The dish itself was very shallow, so the dessert itself ended up as equal portions of crumble with fruit. Personally I prefer a thin layer of crumble with lots of fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed. Not a great meal by any means. But...the perfect crackling is enough reason for me to give 10 Greek Street another try.",

Lately though I'm finding that a lot of my Soho no-booking favs are getting more and more up towards the 2 hours wait time, which even I think is a little ridiculous.Where 10 Greek Street differs to most in the no-reservations crowd, is that you can put your details on a list and someone will phone you when your table is ready. \u00a0The wait will still likely be long, but at least you can go somewhere nearby for a pre-dinner drink while you wait. The restaurant itself is well worth the wait. For me it ticked all the boxes - a lot of atmosphere for a small space (and the fact that you don't have scores of people crowding around the entrance or bar means you don't feel crowded or that there is too much noise to be heard), the food was excellent, and the bill was surprisingly reasonable.My tuna carpaccio entree was tasty however the highlight was the t-bone steak - a massive slab of meat for two people to share. It was tender and tasty, and the accompanying truffle mash was delicious and I want more. \u00a0The bill came to \u00a340 a head (including a very nice bottle of wine!) - leaving me trying to figure out for a short while what they had left off the bill. Nothing as it turns out, it's just very reasonably priced for the quality.",

Mr Hyde just throws out the menu and instead just cooks whatever he feels like. From little things like ingredients being swapped out for different ones or whole items being left of the plate. It's hard to really judge the food when every plate is a disappointing half attempt at cooking whatever was promised when you ordered it. I'm sorry Dr Jekyll, but you need to get Hyde out of the kitchen.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, I would've given 10 Greek four stars, but after one of the most solid and friendly meals we've had in London in a long time this past the weekend, I'm giving it the full monty. Everyone knows what Soho is like on a Saturday night. Now, take that Soho and make the weather beautiful in the month of August. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more frenetic and drunk atmosphere anywhere in the world. We, however, were in search of dinner and not the tiniest bit drunk (yet)... I have a love-hate relationship with the no-bookings policy that has graced London as of late. The 'hate' part being pretty self-explanatory. But we all know how insane it is to try and plan a weekend on less than two weeks notice (and much longer for the newest, hottest spots). Unless, that is, it's a no-bookings dinner place. Then you just rock up and work your own personal fortitude (aka alcohol). A queue two hundred people deep? No worries! Just start in on that bottle you stashed in your handbag.OR, if it's like 10 Greek, they'll just take your info and call you when a table becomes available. Then you can just wander over to Dean Street Townhouse and lubricate yourself with one of their many fine cocktails, while giggling at the uber-fashionable set wobbling drunkenly on their platform pumps. It's a win-win really. Although this fine Saturday evening, we got very lucky and walked in right when tables were beginning to turnover from the early-birds. I gave the waiter our info, and then he thought better of it, and told us to wait in the bar, and a table would open up in twenty minutes or so. If we hadn't been waiting on two more, I would've just settled in to eat in the back. It's a quaint little spot where you can watch the kitchen and bar work simultaneously under the octangular skylight.We had a magnificently well balanced negroni and a seasonally appropriate raspberry bellini--oh yes, did I mention they keep prosecco on tap? And true to his word, the waiter seated us twenty minutes later sans friends, who didn't arrive for another twenty. We told him we could wait in the bar, no trouble, and he wasn't having it. This is the part of the evening I spent being very confused, as to why a waitstaff would be so nice to us. But I got over it, and ordered more booze.Once we were settled, we ordered a variety from the chalkboard of seasonal, daily-changing delights. I started with the mushroom rotolo served with truffle cream. Good god, it was tasty. Earthy and unctuous, the mushrooms countered the sweetness of the cream on all the right levels. The hubs ordered the scallop tartare, which turned out to be more of a ceviche served with wafer-thin crispbread. He reported it divine. Our dining companions both had the heritage tomato salad and cleaned their plates.As a main, I had a butterflied and grilled poussin with borlotti beans and roasted courgettes in a balsamic reduction. It was delicious. My veg friend had the seasonal risotto, which she loved. The boys split the t-bone, and reported it not enough for two. It was served with jersey royals, and became the write-off of the evening. We didn't order dessert, and instead opted to wade through the ever-increasing pub crowds for Gelupo gelato. But we did manage to order a bottle of Australian shiraz I've never seen on a wine list outside of the US. It was a lovely surprise and a great addition to our meal. This is the third time I've been to 10 Greek for dinner, and if they can continue on this upswing, I think I may just become a regular. No-reservation policy and all.",

    "text": "Is it me, or has there been a surge of casual hipster restaurants opening lately? \u00a0Many of them have similar qualities: an unassuming store front, waitresses in retro wear, wood-based interior, and a daily menu. \u00a010 Greek street fits this profile to a point. \u00a0But behind this trendy exterior, there is at heart,a non-pretentious Soho joint with a focus on fresh ingredients & a modern twist on traditional British fare.Service - I really liked the service here - we dropped by on a Friday night, and were told there was a 30 minute wait. \u00a0However, they offered to either take down our number and call us, or seat us in a bar area near the kitchen where we could wait, get a drink,and some bar bites to appease our appetite. \u00a0 I am always impressed when a restaurant in London offers to call you when a table is ready rather than making you queue outside - not enough restaurants do this here.Everyone was very friendly and pleasant the whole evening, and most importantly, they made the effort to make sure we were happy. \u00a0At the end of the evening, I pointed out a mistake on the bill, and the reaction was so apologetic. \u00a0Can't say I've met that kind of attitude frequently in London restaurants. \u00a0Food - When we sat down, the first thing I did was skim the menu (which is written on blackboards around the room). \u00a0I was at a complete loss about what to order because there were at least 3 things that popped out to me. \u00a0I ended up asking the waitress, and decided on a wild rabbit casserole with chorizo & white beans. \u00a0Delish!!!! \u00a0While the menu is short and sweet, 10 Greek does a good job of getting in as much variety as possible - pork, rabbit, fish, beef, duck, veggie all there! \u00a0Dessert was amazing as well - we ended up sharing a chocolate, salted caramel tart & buttermilk ice cream with candied tangerine. \u00a0I really recommend the buttermilk ice cream (if they ever serve it again) - not too sweet, and the buttermilk gives a slightly sour taste to the ice cream that is surprisingly good. \u00a0What really topped the evening though, was when the bill came (har har). \u00a02 beers, wine, an appetizer, 2 mains, 2 desserts --- less than 60 pounds. \u00a0Given the quality of food & service, I'd say 10 Greek is a keeper on my restaurant list!!!",

    "text": "I visited the restaurant last Monday evening with trepidation, but the artfully crafted entrees and charming decor won me over.Firstly, I was anxious about the restaurant's limited menu. The American in me demands a small novel for a menu, filled with a multitude of options, sides, and substitutions. That is not the case at 10 Greek Street. The menus are printed on small rolled parchments, like a message in a bottle. For added whimsy, they are also posted around the restaurant on chalkboards. The second issue that gave me pause is the incredibly small space. I believe that there are about 15 tables. I imagine if you go on a busy night, the wait would be brutal because they do not take dinner reservations. Luckily I dined on a Monday night so it was populated, but not packed. If you cannot secure a proper table, there is also seating at the counter that gives you front row seats to the action in the kitchen.Now onto the most important part: the food! Two friends and I ordered up a storm and shared everything. Here's the break down --1) Pigeon breast, butternut squash & sage. When my friends suggested ordering a plate of \"rat of the sky\", my better judgement told me to suggest an alternative. Losing in a 2-1 vote, I was forced to try this \"delicacy\". Shockingly delicious, I tell you! Pigeon is a little tough, but it tastes like red meat.2) Spiced chickpeas, aubergine & yoghurt. The crispiness of the breaded aubergine complimented the soft chickpeas. I personally didn't find them in the least bit spicy, just well seasoned.3) Bruschetta, fig, burrata & chestnut honey. One of my favorite dishes of the night! This is an excellent fruit & cheese combination that paired nicely with the crisp bruschetta. I'm very pleased that the chefs were able to find ripe figs this late in the season.4) Chermoula, mussels. And this was my absolute favorite dish! Chermoula is my new go-to spice mix. The cumin shined in this mix, adding a sultry flavorful punch. I also detected saffron, which made the dish fragrant and dreamy. Yes, dreamy. I just wish that the dish came with pasta to mix into the broth.5) Chocolate and salted caramel. In a word: DECADENT. Smooth rich chocolate + creamy caramel + sea salt is always a winning combination.6) Lemon sorbet, vodka. Light and refreshing way to end the meal.Overall, I loved the ambience and the food, and was lucky to be in good company :)Oh, one last thing: the bathrooms are spotless! I know that this seems random, but restaurants with gross bathrooms make me wonder if everything else is up to code lol.",

They stay pretty busy throughout the week...but skip the seating area and ask for a seat in the bar area as they're the best seats in the place and overlook the kitchen where you get to watch all the action. The young man who waited on us was excellent and had an in depth knowledge of food and wine pairings. Started with lamb's tongue which was surprisingly tender, very flavorful, and a great value (GBP 7). The waiter paired it with a lovely Trebbiano which went well with the tongue despite being a white wine. Main was cod cheeks wrapped in prosciutto (GBP 15). Not sure I'd wrap a delicate piece of the fish in prosciutto, but it was still very tasty and a great value. Each course I asked for a wine pairing to go with that particular food. Each pairing was awesome and ranged from GBP 4.50 to GBP 6. Didn't want to stop eating and had to order a starter of padron peppers...and, of course, a wine pairing! An amazing experience you'll not want to miss!!!",

    "text": "10 greek street doesn't take reservations at dinner only walk in so go early or be prepared to queue. The decor is pretty basic, or rustic if I was being kind!; no tablecloths, chalk blackboards. It felt like I was eating in a pub rather than a restaurant. I don't mind about the decor if the food is good and luckily this was. I had lamb with sweet potato and broccoli. The portion was a bit on the small side but it is a complete plate of food, my pet peeve is when restaurants give you just a piece of meat or fish thereby forcing you to order sides . This is simple cooking done well. For dessert we split an apple and quince crumble. a chocolate terrine and amaretto ice cream and an almond and rubarb tart. The crumble and chocolate were clear winners with the almon tart a distant third. I can't really put my finger on why this dessert wasn't that good as normally I love that flavour combination. But more hits than misses so I would still go back.",

It is enough to serve 2, but I was still hungry afterwards and I ate the bigger half of the dish lol. And yes, I had an appetizer as well (fried baby squid, which was also a small portion).

The food was decent enough but given the price, I was expecting a bit more. We shared the burrata which was creamy and delicious and came doused in a good glug of olive oil. The fried baby squid was crunchy and not greasy but had too much batter. This felt quite heavy as a consequence so worth sharing. The plaice, although overseasoned, was well cooked and paired well with the courgette. However, I would have preferred it on the bone. Overall a decent meal but I'm not sure I'd come running back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this restaurant and had really high hopes for this place, but was disappointed after waiting an hour for a table. This place is tiny and the service is a bit slow so the tables don't turn-over quickly, so be prepared to wait. We went at 8 pm on a Friday evening (party of 2), and were quoted a 1.5 hr wait, but we were able to get a table in an hour. The place is tiny so don't try to do a walk-in with more than 2 or 4 people, they probably only have capacity for 30-40 people in the whole restaurant.We shared a few small plates, an entree and a dessert, which was enough food. Including a glass of wine for each of us, our dinner for two was ~\u00a372. The menu rotates frequently depending on what is in season, etc. which I always appreciate and like.They bring you complimentary bread, and there's olive oil at the tables for you to start with. Portion size of the bread was a little small, but it was free so I can't complain too much.Pea and Asparagus Soup (\u00a37) - This was nice, warming and comforting for a grey London evening, but I didn't find this to be anything to write home about. I couldn't really taste too many pronounced flavors of the pea or asparagus. There's definitely cream in this soup, so despite it being a green soup, I don't think it's that healthy. Portion size is generous though, and my friend and I were able to share this.N'duja on Bread (\u00a37) - I love n'djua on pizza, but I actually didn't care for this. It was a small/thin piece of bread, with a thick layer of n'duja (a spicy pork sausage) on top. I didn't feel the proportions were right, and it was too spicy to really enjoy this properly. I think n'duja is better consumed in small amounts like on pizza. Also for the price, this was a miss for me.Baby Squid (\u00a38) - I've had better fried squid dishes in my life. Like the name suggests, these are tiny baby squid pieces (not larger calamari or calamari rings). There seemed to be too much batter in proportion to the squid and it was oily. This was a miss for me.Broccolini (\u00a34) - This was one of my favorite dishes - the portion size was decent and the broccolini was chargrilled well and not burnt. I'd recommend this if you're looking for some vegetables.Sea bream, peperonata, spinach, runner beans & brown shrimp (\u00a321) - Thought this was okay - it wasn't bad, but I wasn't savouring every last bite either, or necessarily sad when the dish was finished. The fish was nice quality, but I've had better fish dishes elsewhere, especially for the price.Chocolate Pot de Creme with Amarena Cherries (\u00a38) - This was my favorite dish of the night - but I love anything with chocolate. This was a pot de creme done right - not too sweet, just the right texture. The cherries were a little bit on the sweet side, but paired fine with the chocolate. I'd come back here again at the end of an evening just to get this dessert.I'd eat here again if the wait was 15-30 min, but I wouldn't wait an hour or longer to eat here. Maybe I came on an off-night and I shoud give this place another try, but compared to the other places where I've waited 1 hour for a table, this place just fell short for me. The service was a bit slow; I guess it can be nice when you're having a 3 hour leisurely meal, but we were there for 2.5 hours, more because we were waiting for the service and dishes to be served than us sitting there at the end of our meal just enjoying our drinks & company.",

I brutally forced THREE friends of mine to go to 10 Greek Street for dinner because they wanted to have Greek food, and I might have 'accidentally' omitted that the restaurant takes its name from the street and that there is not one bit of \u00a0Saganaki to be seen here. They didn't hate me for it though, because the food is good. It's pricey, and I don't think it's 'OH GAWD IT WAS SO GOOD I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH I'VE SPENT' good, but still, it's quality. Doesn't deserve less than 4 stars because it's a notch above 'a-okay', so there. My friends ordered a few starters to share, whilst I was busy disappointing myself for ordering the wrong lamb dish (there was an amazing looking tower of lamb chops that some dude was devouring on the table next to ours, and I really really wanted that...alas, I ended up ordering the lamb pie instead, because my brain short-circuited after reading 'lamb' and wasn't able to process the rest of the ingredients. Next time).Everybody liked their food, and my pie was really tasty and super filling. The only two things I didn't really love were the super cramped space (tiny tables, too many for the tiny room, usual stuff) and the fact that they only give you one menu and only if you're sitting in the corner table, 'because it's all up there, on the board'. Definitely going back to get that lamb, and it'd better taste as good as it looked.",

Today, It was quiet and peaceful. I met an old college buddy that recently came back from Russia. He said he missed London restaurants the most. The service we received was so good my ego achieved a new level. I love good treatment and compliments (who doesn't?). Anyway, he ordered the white pork because of my recommendations, but I wanted to try something different this time. I saw there was paccheri in today's lunch menu and this has been probably the best decision I've made today.My meal came rather quickly and I couldn't even finish my conversation. I had never before enjoyed such a delicious bowl of paccheri, with mushrooms and summer truffle, topped with fresh burrata. It wasn't the first time that I tasted this combination of flavors. I'm a little pasta enthusiast and I ensure you it tasted nearly as good as the original (Italian one). A great meal and a good talk always put me in a great mood. Maybe it's true that there is no love sincerer than the love of food.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch, but due to the timing of my arrival, I was only served tapas. \u00a0Lessons learned: Understand the tube better next time!Fried Baby Squid- Crispy, crunchy, fried little critters, without a coating of a thick batter. \u00a0 However, after a few bites, the fried part really starts to settle in, and becomes a bit on the heavy side. \u00a0Although it was served with some sort of in-house aioli, which was rather plain, I would have appreciated a bit more acid in the aioli to make it even a better experience.Quail egg, sobrasada and aioli- OMG YUM! Definitely my favorite dish I tried! The light and delicate quail egg is served as a scotch egg, cradled by ground sobrasada, then fried. \u00a0This is also served on top of a base of the in-house aioli. \u00a0However, this dish would be great without even using the aioli, as the dip didn't do anything for the main ingredients of this dish.Chicken Liver Parfait- I am a fan of chicken liver mousse, and this in-house made chicken displays the wholesome flavors of what it tastes like to make a product from care! \u00a0I was able to taste the sweet, tart, and full bodied flavors the chef was able to infuse into the chicken liver, while spread on a lightly toasted slice of rye and topped with a perfect crunch of gherkins.Padron peppers: Lightly flash-fried, these peppers are kept in their natural state. \u00a0Served in a bowl, filled with probably 20 small peppers, this dish is as simple as it gets. \u00a0The flavors of this pepper had a bitter taste, and the preparation was lackluster. After eating 2 small peppers, I could not handle it anymore. \u00a0However, the staff was lovely enough to acknowledge my lack of interest in this dish, and to take it off my bill.The staff was grand, kind, and welcoming. \u00a0The restaurant is quaint, small, yet inviting. \u00a0The kitchen is open and hides nothing. \u00a0This is a place that I would love to come back to, to try their main plates, and indulge in other dishes created by the chef's passion for wholesome, quality kitchen creations.",

Food was great. We ordered the veal chop and summer squash tartine for main. The dessert we shared, Bake Alaska, was amazing. \u00a0What I like the most, however, is the drink list. A very good selection at very good price. Nyetimber is 6.5 pound a glass! You can also order wine for half bottle. Highly recommend!",

Quince crumble for dessert was also incredible - sort of like an apple/pear crumble but significantly better.",

Well, the guys from 10 Greek Street made it happen, and that already deserves its shares of stars! The restaurant is very well decorated, and stands out by its simplicity. A few things on the menu & the chalkboard that seem like they're being updated everyday. My father in law and I enjoyed the welsh beef for 2! Cooked perfectly (red), and the duck fat fried potatoes were the perfect fit. Wifey had the lamb, here again, still pink and very tasty. Overall a very good & unexpected dinner experience, although the Yelpers did point us in the right direction through the great reviews here...completely in line with our judgement! Lovely spot!",

I do adore gnocchi, so thought it would be fun to try! \u00a0The dish was beautifully presented with amazingly fresh peas, asparagus and mushrooms. Sadly, the gnudi themselves tasted pasty to me and I didn't enjoy the texture, which I found out was ricotta rather than potato based. Still, I was the one that took the risk and the culinary adventure was worth it. \u00a0What I also loved about this place was the bread (4 distinct types) which were brought to me as soon as I arrived. The foccacia was a particular stand-out, but I also enjoyed the corn bread.The pricing and style of this place (too-cool-for-school) were offset by the niceness of the wait staff. I'm not sure I'd return since I think Nopi are similar for the price-point and have nicer loos! Just my tuppence worth ;)",

    "text": "Being an intrepid foodie, I glean tips on new restaurants to visit by reading professional reviews in newspapers and magazines, see what's hot on Yelp and by word of mouth. 10 Greek Street has been wowing the critics since opening, so I decided that I needed to pay a little visitThe restaurant is very unassuming from the outside and the menu, which changes daily, can be found on the window. 10 Greek Street may seem a minimalist name but perhaps it reflects the fact that it's hard to pigeonhole the style of food hereApparently, following discussion amongst the staff, the boss finally settled reluctantly on the term modern European. Despite this restaurant not carrying the longest menu, you'll find a good variety of dishes with trout, hake, goat, rack of lamb and pork all being available as main dishes. The cooking is largely classical with a few influences from the Mediterranean and some from the imagination of the head chef like a date and samphire combo which accompanied the sea trout.The flexibility in having a daily menu is that they can put fresh things on menu as and when they become available. They have a forager delivering ingredients like wild asparagus and the boss has used his time in the industry (he was the head chef at the Wapping Project fo 6 years) to cultivate a band of suppliers to make the restaurant has the freshest ingredients, which is the foundation of the amazing food hereAn amazing bonus when I walked in for lunch was the waitress's offer of a place at the kitchen counter, my favourite spot. I love watching chefs at work and the atmosphere in the internationally staffed (Kiwi, Aussie, Hungarian and Bangladeshi) small kitchen was convivial. Michael looked after me well at the counter and Daniel and Jack cooked perfect looking dishes while having time to answer my foodie questions. A truly interactive mealI opened with the fried baby sand eels, which came from Spain. The vivid yellow of the freshly made mayonnaise which accompanied the crunchy and perfectly seasoned little eels told me immediately that they understand flavour and have rthe confidence to make their dish appear minimal but making sure that every component on that dish sings in harmony. A squeeze of citrus from a lemon wedge added the necessary balance to make this bowl of crunchy morsels a pleasure to eatI followed with the crumbed goat, served on a bed of crushed Jersey royals and peas and finished with a spoonful of caper mayonnaise on top. I liked the idea of goat and Micheal's description of the meat being slowly braised to extract maximum flavour sealed it. I did appreciate the crispy crumbed coating which added texture but the meat was gloriously moist, unctuous and packed a meaty taste, which was too deep to be described as gamey. The tangy caper mayonnaise again added balance and perhaps the only criticism of my whole meal could be that I could done with more of itI couldn't summon enough space for dessert as I had already planned a visit to a newly opened milkshake bar I had spotted on the way over to 10 Greek Street. I did confess and make my apologies to the kitchen staffOne other touch of class of this place was that as soon as I sat down, a bowl of delicious bread arrived and a bottle of tap water was served up. No service charge appeared on the bill and \u00a321 for food of this quality is astoundingI have to give a shout out to one of my fellow diners at the restaurant counter, Caroline, who was very kind to give me a try of the burrata, which she adores and wanted me to experience. This creamy mozzarella style cheese was given punch with salt, pepper and grated lemon rind - a creamy mouthful of heavenThis kitchen knows to deliver on flavour. With those prices and an ever changing menu, I can see myself becoming a regular here for sure",
