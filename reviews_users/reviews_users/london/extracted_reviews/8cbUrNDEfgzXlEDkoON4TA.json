Fortunately, for the large part I was wrong...The dining area is split into two, old-fashioned tables and chairs at the front and for those with a bit of bend still left in their knees, sunken 'shoe-free' bunkers at the back. Call me a hypocrite after what I just said about gimmicks but I liked the novelty factor of sitting on the floor. I also liked our starters- a lot! Soft Shell Crab and Seafood Tempura could have been a rather greasy combination but both dishes had deliciously light batter and were scattered with chilli and lime to add a zesty edge. For mains my friends ordered Thai Basil Prawns and Pumpkin Curry whilst I went for the Squid with Garlic and Peppers. Unfortunately, both of their meals beat mine hands down. The curry was perfect comfort food- wholesomely spicy and filling. The prawns more-ish and hot. My squid, chewy and tasteless. However, I'm not going to hold this against 'Yum, Yum' as we really did have a great night and the service was lovely. So instead I'll say 'Go! Enjoy! Avoid the squid!'.",

The difference between the two premises is probably a few hundred thousand pounds in fit out costs, the newer premises being the more upmarket. I think the owner(s) toured a few Islington restaurants and advised their architect to bring a composite of the restaurant designs of that area to the poor deprived denizens of Stoke Newington, who until this point have made do with some fairly amateur restaurant interiors. So as an ambience and design exercise the place is of note. The food is a bit of a mixed bag, and there in lies the eternal restaurant conundrum, should one value style over substance.

But don't be put off by the ridiculous fountain and kitsch beach huts in the courtyard; once you get inside the restaurant, it is a completely different experience. With its dark teak walls and sunken tables, the restaurant is surprisingly elegant. The owner told me that it is the largest Thai restaurant in Europe, and I believe him- it is huge, with two floors (one is a bar and private dining room downstairs) They run an excellent happy hour, with half price cocktails before 7pm and often run deals with dining websites which makes their already affordable menu even cheaper. I recently signed up for a membership card with the restaurant and I now get special deals and discounts sent through to me by email. The set menus are quite expensive for dinner (over 23 per person) but they give you an incredible amount of food. For real value though, go for their express lunch- 7.95 for a starter, main course and rice or 5.95 for a main course and rice.We go at least once a week and it never disappoints.",

Take the maximum people you can fit in a mini and add the number of people you can get on a double decker, then multiply it by the number of sweaty bodies crushed on a rush-hour Central line tube carriage. This place is BIG - bigger than Tom Hanks in Big combined with a Big Mac to the power of the Notorious B.I.G.. .You get me?On this particular Saturday night it was full of birthday parties that seated about 30 people per table, one of which I was part of. \u00a0There seemed to be a more intimate area at the back of the restaurant where smaller parties sit on cushions on the floor. \u00a0Additionally there's a cocktail lounge area as you walk in with happy hour before 7.30pm (I think) \u00a0- only the place was rammed and I was queuing so long that the hour was up by the time I was served. By the downstairs loos, there also appeared to be a secret drinking lounge area- complete with a man on the door to prevent entry to rampant toilet seekers. I was completely utterly under the grip of an evil deathly cold, and was trying hard to not sneeze on my companions. I shouldn't have been out at all, and perhaps wouldn't have made the effort had I know there would be 29 people at dinner to take my place (gripe over!).So dosed up on three times the legal limit of lemsip, I might not have been in the best frame of mind to judge everything with a clear head. However it seemed to be me that the place was way too large and busy for my liking and the staff were clearly overworked. It was hard to attract their attention. As our party was also large for ease we ordered the set menus. Although we received plenty of food, the assortment of starters in our 'yum yum platter' were all deep fried and pretty homogenous. For mains the vegetarian set menu we ordered came with Thai red curry with vegetables, Saut\u00e9ed aubergines, Mixed vegetables and rice. I did like the fact that the vegetables weren't overcooked and were very crisp. It was nice enough, but all pretty standard. The set menu was definitely overpriced at \u00a322 - \u00a326. If you want to forgo to the funkily lit decor, then you can get a more varied meal at many of the other Thai restaurants across the capital. For instance \u00a312 at the unglamorous Charlie Wrights in Hoxton gets you similar but much better value fayre. yelp.co.uk/biz/charlie-w\u2026In summary - pleasant food but not particularly spectacular.

However there was something about the person on the other end of the phone, that told me this was not completely true. So we jumped in the car and hot footed it down to Yum Yums, and surprise surprise they miraculously had space for us. Before being seated we indulged in some pre dinner cocktails, I had \"Rosy Cheeks\" and the bar man wrote my name in my cocktail and put flowers (made with red sauce) in it. I must admit I was truly impressed! The staff were very friendly they had good knowledge of what the dishes on the menu were, and when we finally placed our order. I suddenly decided I wanted to change the seasoned chicken balls, for a Yum Yum platter. I wasn't overly impressed with the Yum Yum platter it seemed like a bit of a rip off, as there were only a few meaty nibbles in there like the satay chicken, and some other little bits but the majority of it was fried vegetables that we did not eat. However the chicken prawn toast and the vegetable spring rolls were all delicious, and cooked to perfection. For our main course we had fried rice with chicken, and chicken and ginger noodles with chillies. The food was really tasty and well cooked, however for the price we paid the portions could have been a little bit bigger. Also they should warn people about the intensity of the chillies contained in the dishes, as I chewed a chilli and couldn't stop coughing, my eyes were watering and everything, and this is coming from someone who loves to eat scotch bonnet peppers! But overall Yums Yums is a nice restaurant the decor is really nice, it's got a great atmosphere however I think it's a little bit on the pricey side, but I would definitely visit again.",

There's a pretty good selection of meaty and veggie things on the lunch menu but I went straight for the Tom Yum Gai - basically the hot, sour soup but done as a main course with noodles and chicken.

I have been to Yum Yum many times (and even used to go the old building on Church Street) and have never been disappointed with the food. The red thai chicken curry is great if you love your food spicy and the pad thai is also one of my favourite Yum Yum dishes. One of the best things about Yum Yum is the happy hour before 7pm so you can get drink your cocktails for half price. I always try to get there for happy hour so I can enjoy a Mojito \u00a0(or two!) with dinner. Yum Yum is a great venue for any celebration and the staff are always ver attentive and willing to explain anything on the menu. Yum Yum is certainly yummy!",

    "text": "I loved this restaurant when it was located on Stoke Newington Church Street, it was just around the corner from me and very handy for a top-notch takeaway. Now it's moved on to the High Street, it's really not that much further away, but it seems like it. It's in a far more imposing building and very swish indeed. When I did try to get a takeaway from the new premises, I couldn't get through it was so busy, so I had to walk round and order. There then followed a long wait in the bar, where I felt quite out of place. I ordered a cocktail, but still felt like a fish out of water. The prices had shot up too. Probably the most expensive takeaway I've ever ordered. They're really trading on their reputation now. I'll stick to Lemongrass for my thai food now. Nice place for a special occasion though. And I dropped in with a friend for a late night cocktail this summer. We had fun chatting to the barmen who clearly know their stuff when it comes to mixing a drink and are happy to recommend one to suit your taste.",

The new restaurant has a raised shoe-free seating area for a different experience, a cocktail bar and stylish decor. The staff are friendly and the service is good. Just if anyone need it - the new address of yum yum is: 183-187 Stoke Newington High StLondon, N16 0LH Just went again recently and the visit confirmed how good this place is. We were a large group who shared all our dishes and they were all superb. Green curry, pad thai and prawn curry were my favourites. The pre-dinner cocktail was absolutely delicious and I'm thinking I will have to go back for more!! The service of our 15 strong group was good and very consistent!",

My boyfriend often gets upset at me because I compare SE Asian food available in London unfavourabley to that in Australia or indeed from my travels around the place as a young backpacker. Often halfway through a meal I'll go it was better in Brisbane and he'll sigh with frustration. This NEVER happens at Yum Yums! The food here is stunning, from the Pad Thai to the Mussellman curries. The decor is lovely too, a bit flowery and pink for the man in my life, but most people are fine with that kind of thing! The cocktails are delish! The service is wonderful from beginning to end, and we've never had cause to complain. This is a great place to bring a group of friends for a meal, just be sure to book first!",

It appears that Gordon Ramsay concurs!The atmosphere is sexy and exotic, the food delightful and perfectly seasoned, and artfully presented. We choose to sit \u00a0\"Asian style\"on the floor with large cushions and generally order mass quantities of different items to share that are spicy, hot, sweet and salty!.Some of the highlights are the \u00a0Thai green curry cooked with king prawns, coconut milk and fresh Thai herbs, Chicken stir-fried with ginger, onions and black mushrooms,lemon grass chicken fresh black peppercorns, coriander roots, garlic, coconut milk & soya sauce & baked to perfection! The starter spring rolls and soft shell crab are excellent. After several bottles of wine, you tend to forget what you are eating and enjoy the combinations of various flavours and aromas as they hit your palate!",

We had a bit of a mix up with the orders and a lunch forgotten but other than that it was a very nice experience. The wheelchair access is a bit tricky getting into the restaurant but the lift inside to the toilet was very convenient. I would definitely try it for the dinner atmosphere.

We had to ask the poor waiter to go and get them again so we could ask why. \"I'll come talk to you in a minute\" we were told, 15 minutes later and we send the waiter to find the manager again. He reluctantly rolls up to our now starving table and tells us the offer doesn't exist, refuses to answer questions etc. we received no apology and were made to feel like we were ripping the restaurant off!

    "text": "It is rare I am truly captivated by Thai food in a restaurant but Yum Yum has made me rethink how I look at Thai food. I absolutely love food from Thailand but have found a lot of the stuff you get here in the UK is a bit run of the mill. It can sometimes make you feel a bit like once you've had one pad thai you'be had them all...same can be said of green curry et al. But Yum Yum really blew me away. It's in a great location, is absolutely stunning on the inside and there wasn't a lobster tank this time around so I got to have a wonderful meal with my beloved uninterrupted by cannibalistic lobsters. (If you don't get where I am coming from see my review I wrote on here about Pattersons). We had some dim sum to start, then I opted for some beef with long beans which came with lots of chilli. My beloved had scallops with chilli and thai basil and we shared some coconut rice and had a dish of morning glory which was cooked with blackbeans, garlic and chilli. To say it was amazing isn't doing it justice. I want to go back as the food was so good. I also liked that the menu was large, varied and I do believe there is something for everyone on there. They didn't go too crazy with the chilli either so you weren't left with your tonsils on fire or anything like that. The cocktail menu is well worth abusing, I mean, sampling. The delicate balances of slightly unusual ingredients all worked and was at a rather reasonable price too. For dessert we shared a coconut crusted banana fritter which came with coconut ice cream and a palm sugar biscuit. It was divine and well worth ordering. I can't wait to go back and sample more stuff from that menu as it had a lovely balance of everything and was reasonable. Most expensive main was around \u00a314 and they had a good selection of set menus too. I suggest you go there ready for a food marathon as your taste buds will want to do a culinary pentathlon (well mine did anyway)",

Needless to say the other Thai restaurant in the competition beat Yum Yum's ( a tiny little place somewhere out of London, can't remember where) and I was happy with the result.Yum Yums is a bit over rated but it has been in the area for quite some time, so I guess it's a stable, solid & reliable restaurant for the locals.The food is so so, tiny portions, nothing spectacular (pretty westernised Thai food, spices played down etc) and pretty expensive.The building is beautiful, cocktails aren't bad either, which is where it steps up a mark.",

When Lolo suggested we meet up at Yum Yum I was little Ms Smiley Face. Their building is gorgeous and every time I cross the threshold into their mini courtyard, complete with buddha guarding a small fountain, while sandwiched between two grass roofed huts; I feel transported away from everything that lies beyond their walls. Once inside the large welcoming space is punctuated by dark wood furniture, bamboo rolled hanging lights and a nice breakout dinning area that caters for large groups (there is a low level seating area at the back which is fun, but not advisable if you don't like pdos (public displays of shoelessness!).There is also a more general dining space and a kick arse bar.On the food front expect fairly standard Thai dishes,well cooked and well presented. Their spring rolls were excellent, light crispy pastry wrapped around gently blanched vegetables, paired with a sweet chilli sauce.The fish cakes were tasty but a little heavy on the coriander,blunting the usual flavour of the dish. My main chicken pad thai arrived with a side order of crushed peanuts,allowing me to determine just how much I wanted on my dish. What did surprise me was the size of my plate.Clearly portion control has taken a hold at Yum Yum, because the last time I ate there, my serving was so large I had to get a doggy bag !

However there was something about the person on the other end of the phone, that told me this was not completely true.So we jumped in the car and hot footed it down to Yum Yums, and surprise surprise they miraculously had space for us.Before being seated we indulged in some pre dinner cocktails, I had \"Rosy Cheeks\" and the bar man wrote my name in my cocktail and put flowers (made with red sauce) \u00a0in it. I must admit I was truly impressed!The staff were very friendly they had good knowledge of what the dishes on the menu were, and when we finally placed our order. I suddenly decided I wanted to change the seasoned chicken balls, for a Yum Yum platter. I wasn't overly impressed with the Yum Yum platter it seemed like a bit of a rip off, as there were only a few meaty nibbles in there like the satay chicken, and some other little bits but the majority of it was fried vegetables that we did not eat. However the chicken prawn toast and the vegetable spring rolls were all delicious, and cooked to perfection. For our main course we had fried rice with chicken, and chicken and ginger noodles with chillies. The food was really tasty and well cooked, however for the price we paid the portions could have been a little bit bigger. Also they should warn people about the intensity of the chillies contained in the dishes, as I chewed a chilli and couldn't stop coughing, my eyes were watering and everything, and this is coming from someone who loves to eat scotch bonnet peppers!But overall Yums Yums is a nice restaurant the decor is really nice, it's got a great atmosphere however I think it's a little bit on the pricey side, but I would definitely visit again.",

Yum Yum, I have to say, makes one of the best Lamb Massaman curries in London. It is around 10 pounds but definitely worth it.Another really exciting thing is the fact that they deliver to your home.
