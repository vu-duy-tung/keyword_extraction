They brought round after round of fresh tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa whilst we were waiting for our meals - we had to stop them bring more out as we would not have been able to eat our food! :-) Mother chose chicken fajita soft tacos which were excellent. Our steaks with a chipotle sauce and Bacon wrapped Tiger prawns with Monterry Jack cheese was too much seasoned with salt, coupled with the salt from the sauce and bacon. I would recommend that if you have a low salt tolerance like us, or are on a low sodium diet then just let the staff know. The toilets were well designed and in black slate tiling. Great place for crashing out for lunch if around Covent Garden / St Martin's Lane. Good family restaurant. Overall, had a great lunch and we will definitely be going back.",

If i'd paid \u00a31.99 for a ready meal and it tasted like this I would feel ripped off although if you go in with the idea that a ready meal is the standard to expect you might not feel so ripped off. Particularly laughable is their use of the word 'Gourmet', unless they think that Gourmet simply means 'expensive'? This is not authentic Mexican food. This is Mexican food tweaked to appeal to the USA (you'll notice most good reviews around the web are from US travelers finding a taste of home). Fair is fair though and not everything here is abysmal - the service is very good, helpful and friendly \u00a0shame it's not enough to make up for all the other faults.",

    "text": "Mexican food in London?!Right after we order, they bring out two kinds of salsa. The warm tomatillo salsa has to be the best salsa I've ever had! It's got a lil spice to it, but not too much. We also ordered the guacamole appetizer which they made fresh right in front of our table. The guac was a little plain, it needed some garlic and more lime juice in my opinion. So I mixed in the tomatillo salsa with the guac and it was PERFECT! I could eat that for every meal of the day for about 8 days before getting sick of it. (Prop bet me, I dare you!)Main course: I couldn't decide between the chile relleno or the enchiladas, so I got the enchiladas de chile relleno. Bad choice, it sounded like a great idea at the time and looked like it would have tons of flavor, but it failed.Dessert: Mexican Brownie!!!! WOW! Don't you dare even think about not getting dessert or getting something else! It's a chocolate brownie with pecans served on a hot skillet with mexican brandy butter poured onto the plate and Vanilla (sometimes cinnamon) ice cream on top. The smell that comes off the dish is one of the most delectable scents that will grace your nose in your entire life! Like, if I bottled it up and sprayed it on Pee-wee Herman, he would be intensely irresistible to you, that mouthwatering!Even though I didn't like my main course, the salsa and brownie were so damn delicious that I have to go back.anitaeat.com",

We went there on a Saturday evening and the atmosphere was buzzing. Happily, the interior is spacious enough that you can still enjoy your private conversation without raising your voice. The best of both worlds really.We ordered the guacamole for starters, which they mixed at the table. It was outstandingly good. The tacos and enchiladas for our main were also excellent \u00a0stuffed full of fresh ingredients and flavour. The staff are so friendly and helpful. A great place for a group of friends to celebrate a special occasion or for an intimate dinner for two with none of the stuffiness that usually comes with restaurants that are hyped as 'romantic'. I'd advise you book ahead. They have a lot of tables, but the place was almost full when we got there at 6pm. Hope to return again in the future.",

    "text": "It sort of annoyed me when the waiter came to take my order and said that this is an authentic Texas chain from the US. Don't be fooled, no one who is actually from California/Texas (the hub of mexican/\"tex mex\" food that this place is trying to emulate) would actually ever eat here. They do have it in the US, but its average at best. The one really good part is the free table salsas/chips -- the chips come hot sometimes and the salsas are homemade and delicious. However the entrees always leave something to be desired. The meat is not particularly tasty or fresh and the cheese is processed. If you order guacamole, be prepared for a gimmick where they make it fresh at your table and then charge you like \u00a310 for the pleasure (not worth it). On top of that, the margaritas they sell are very pricy as well. I have been twice, and I never leave feeling like I get good value-for-money. I realise that this is London and you can't expect much on the Mexican front, but there are better places. And frankly, I would rather eat at Chipotle up the road and pay \u00a37 versus blowing a \u00a320 at this place. It's also telling that they are always more on the emptier side versus the other covent garden restaurants in the immediate vicinity.",

    "text": "Cantina Laredo promises gourmet Mexican food. I presume they mean gourmet as in Gourmet Burger Kitchen as it really isn't anything special. There is nothing on the menu that you won't \u00a0find at any chain Mexican restaurant and presentation is no better.The big \"feature\" dish is their guacamole, prepared table side. I have nothing against dishes prepared table side, as long as it adds something to the dish. All we got was a waitress mashing some avocado quietly at the end of the table and then adding some pre-chopped ingredients. The fact is, this was some of the blandest guacamole I've \u00a0ever tasted. You can't help but wonder that if it was prepared in a kitchen by a chef they might have seasoned it correctly. At \u00a36.95 for a bowl of dip it's pretty inexcusable.The main courses don't get any better. I went for one of their house specialities, the Enchiladas Veracruz. On first impression, this didn't look too bad but it was by far the most inedible thing I've been served in any restaurant. The chicken was so dry that it felt like cotton wool in my mouth. You could have chewed on it forever and not been able to swallow it as it sucked the moisture from your mouth. Had I not been there as part of someone's birthday meal I would definitely have sent the dish back. As it was I ended up having to scrape all the chicken out and eat around it. This made it pretty evident that there wasn't much flavour going on elsewhere.Finally we arranged to bring a birthday cake for desert. They agreed to bring it to the table but not much else. We were offered a bent steak knife to cut it due to health and safety according to the waitress. (We later joined a party at another restaurant where they had been given a massive totally undangerous pallet knife for their cake). We had to ask \u00a0for plates and got no cutlery. The waiting staff were pretty uninterested and slow.All in all this is a very expensive way to discover the worst imaginable food. There are so many cheaper better Mexican places in London that you would be mad to go here.",

    "text": "Well, I love the food here, and I'm notoriously difficult to please when it comes to Mexican food, because I cook it myself and know how it should taste.I am from California originally, so have missed real Mexi-food on this side of the Atlantic which has lead me to some true disasters, yes, I'm talking about Cafe Pacifico and La Perla, which bear about as much resemblance to true Mexican cuisine as a weiner schnitzel in a Thai joint.If I had done this review after we first ate there this past July, it would have been five stars, because that day all the planets aligned, it was sunny and warm on the outdoor patio, the waiter was attentive and entertaining, and the food was the best Mexican I've ever eaten on ANY side of the ocean, including our local Mexican joint in Santa Monica, Gilbert's El Indio. The food was really well-prepared and to the right recipe Mexican flavours. But then the restaurant had only just opened and the head honcho from Arizona was in the place making sure everything was done right. I said on that day it was the best Mexican restaurant I had eaten in anywhere, including Mexico itself, San Francisco, all up and down the west coast of the USA including Portland and Seattle and Los Angeles.When we ate there two nights ago after an absence of 3 months, the standards had lowered. Maybe it's just me, but I got the distinct impression that the chef in the kitchen was not the same one, and was no longer a true Mexican cook, as I know they did have in the summertime.The table-made guacamole was good, the chips were warm and never-ending and free, the salsas are delicious and I especially appreciate the touch of having the green tomatillo salsa warm in temperature as well as spicy. BUT! I ordered the enchilada espinaca, a spinach and onion-filled corn tortilla with very bland and insipid cream sauce on it, which was a mistake. The spinach was gritty and full of sand and I couldn't eat it and sent it back.This won't discourage me from going back, they took it off the bill and offered me anything else I wanted, and gave us two free coupons for the guacamole, which was generous of them. In fact one of my tablemates went back three nights in a row for dinner, he liked it so much!Next time I'll get the fajitas, those were terrific last time we went. Stick to what you know, I should have remembered that little pearl of wisdom.",

I ended up with chicken mole--it was decent. \u00a0The cache is the guacamole they make tableside. \u00a0A bit gimicky, chainy, and lacking. \u00a0Be prepared to shell out the big bucks for the margaritas!",

I went here with my girls last Wednesday and we each got two margaritas, (the limit) and enjoyed a tasty dinner. Located near Leicester Square tube station, Cantina Laredo serves up contemporary Mexican food. We all enjoyed our entrees and I would go back to this restaurant for their flavorful and creative takes on Mexican classics. It's a little on the pricy side and I don't know if their food is totally worth it, but finding good Mexican food in London is hard so I guess beggars can't be choosers!",

Now being a Brit, with limited access to decent Mexican food and authentic experiences, I thought I was having my leg pulled when people mentioned that guacamole was going to be made, right in front of my face! There was no leg pulling going on here, if fact, not even a tug.Cantina Laredo is a lovely place to eat; it's clean, has huge booths that sit more than 6 people, has an extensive menu with some things that I haven't see anywhere else in London. It's a classy Mexican joint all right.I actually get quite excited about going for Mexican food now. I can act a bit like a dick and say \"well this is more Californian that Mexican, don't ya know\". I hate myself and love myself in that single moment. I feel like I should have given this place 5 stars. It really was fabulous food and right up my street, but the dick in my is not allowing that. I'll come back again though, actually, I might just go ahead and book a table right now.",

We went for juice and a few mixed starters. Unfortunately my friend didn't like spicy food, so I couldn't really try this place as fully as I'd like. But the tortillas were great and the salsa to die for. It had a real kick.We had a mixture of toastados, tacos and tacquitos - all of which were perfectly adequate.I didn't have any of the more impressive dishes (guacamole made at your table etc.) - but I'm not really in a rush to go back.",

    "text": "This place was very busy on a Saturday night at around 6:30. It kind of had a chain feel to it, but I don't think it is a chain. I could be wrong. When I called to make a resi, I was told they were full but that we could book as priority seating (priority over walk ins) we were given a buzzer when we got there and was told we'd have to wait up to 15 mins. I started to doubt my choice of coming here, but after a really good beer at the bar we were taken down to our table which was around the back in a much nicer setting. I think the front area is for families while the back was more couples and older families. Much more preferable for me. It wasn't full, so the whole priority seating and then the buzzer thing seemed a little weird, but whatever. The food though, I loved it. The guac is made table side and by, in our case, a very hot waitress. It was really nice, filled with tomatoes, onion, peppers and more. That was the highlight for me. I only had chicken fajitas and my date had the veggie ones. She's not a vegetarian, I would not be on a date with her if she was... But after a few days with me in London, I think I'd introduced her to way more meat than she could handle, wink wink. The desserts looked brilliant, they came out on a sizzling platter and then the servers pour some kind of creamy looking butter over the top. They looked great, but we declined this time. Overall a good experience, I would and have recommended it to others. Cheers.",

One day my colleagues were very excited to announce the arrival of a new Mexican restaurant in the city centre...and we immediately decided to give it a try...non sooner said than done are we heading to Covent Garden to judge the authenticity of the food at Cantina Laredo. And here's my verdict: It was ok...it wasn't bad , but it didn't knock off my socks either.From the food-point -of-view: the portions were very generous and the taste was quite alright. I especially enjoyed the warm tortilla chips and the different kinds of accompanying warm salsas. I also liked, that our waitress was making the guacamole right in front of us...which was fun to watch and very entertaining - however, it didn't taste so great as the spice-mixture must've contained too much white pepper.From the atmosphere-pont-of-view: immediately when we entered the restaurant I felt transported into an American suburb where this establishment would have fit in perfectly. In fact, the seating arrangements were so generous that it would have fit perfectly that never-walking and SUV-driving-clientele. (Ups, this might be a little harsh.) The waiting staff was equally inspired by the American service industry: attentive but yet somewhat dull and not very caring beyond what is absolutely necessary. What do I mean by that? - Well, I like it when people are kind to me, but I don't want them to be kind only because some kind of service-standard prescribes it - otherwise I feel like I'm handled like the chicken that we've been eating...So, will I come back? Only if my Mexican craving cannot be satisfied otherwise...",

    "text": "Okay so full disclosure, I am a pretty big snob when it comes to Mexican food. I lived in Southern California for a while and maintain that greasy, cheese-covered, no-English-spoken, hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants will always taste so much better than TexMex or \"fancy\" Mexican. After living in DC for five years I resigned myself to the fact that the East Coast of the US has no good authentic Mexican food, so high-end TexMex will have to do. So far I'm feeling that London will be on a similar page.Cantina Laredo has what you'd expect from any other relatively expensive global Mexican chain. The food is tasty, ingredients are fresh, the service is impeccable, and the price tags are hefty. The guacamole is made to order at the table, which is always a plus because I can make sure they leave out the cilantro (coriander for the Brits). We ordered the mixed fajitas, which included a surprisingly small portion of steak and chicken, supplemented with a ton of grilled onions. The mojitos were very tasty, and my colleague loved his Michelada. A pleasant meal overall, but not mind-blowing.",

We had a pre-booked table for 8 people and were seated promptly.Service was brusque, she took our drinks order and then came back to take our starters order. Starters arrived and were eaten (small portions of average food), we sat with the empty plates for a good ten minutes before they were cleared and then a while later our main orders were taken. Odd!I had a shared mixed fajita dish for two to share as it was one of their signature dishes. The mixed meats were ok but nothing special, they were stingy on the guacamole and there were no jalape\u00f1os!! Upon request a plate of them were brought out for the table to share but they were tasteless, not even a kick to them.I had the churros for pudding and the chocolate dipping sauce didn't taste of anything. Oh, it was so disappointing.A 12.5% service charge was whacked on top of our bill - uh-uh, I don't think so!!The thing that baffles me most is that although this is a big restaurant and we were sat far enough away from the kitchen we still came out with our clothes and hair smelling of food. Yuck!Tourist-trap alert!! Eat elsewhere or be dwindled!",

    "text": "I am a big fan of Cantina Laredo. As a global chain restaurant, they do a great job, and I have eaten at their locations around the world. My rating, however, is based on the attitude of their staff on the night of January 22, 2015. While their Google information says that the restaurant is open until 11:30 pm, their web site has an asterisk that indicates they actually close 1.5 hours earlier than the posted time: 10:00 pm. I showed up at 10:01 pm, after a West End show.When I asked to be seated, I was told that the kitchen was already closed. When I pointed out that it was one-minute past 10:00, the hostess asked \"Can you read? The sign on the door says 10:00. It is 10:01.\" Then giggled with the other hostess about my inability to read. I was shocked at this response, and said that with an attitude like hers, I would not be coming back to Cantina Laredo. Her response was, \"Ok. That's fine.\" Then they giggled together again.As I said, the food is great, the atmosphere is great, and every location is always top notch. However, with employees and attitudes like this, I will truly never return. This is a truly shameful way to treat the people who frequent this restaurant. As someone who travels 300+ days per year for work, I expect to be treated with respect in a restaurant . . . not the rudeness of someone who clearly doesn't understand that hospitality jobs require hospitality.",

To start, I love the salsas they bring to your table with chips to start. And it's real salsa!! Such a simple thing to start already makes me so happy -- I've seen some sad substitutes at other places like tabasco sauce of all things. Thankfully they do it right here. \u00a0The menu is filled with interesting combinations, but I like keeping things simple so I usually get chicken soft tacos or fajitas - both are good here. I like putting some of the homemade salsa they bring to the table with the chips on my tacos - Mmmm, delicioso.Also if you go, you absolutely must order the fresh made guacamole at your table to start. You just can't beat the fresh flavor when it's made at your table. I usually bounce back and forth between this place and Caf\u00e9 Pacifico located close by. I prefer the food here at Cantina Laredo, but the bartenders at Pacifico are amazingly friendly and they have a wide selection of tequila - My Solution: Go to Pacifico bar for a drink and to Laredo for dinner and more drinks or vise versa :D",

Suckers for Mexican food, we gave it a try because they had fish tacos on the menu.Sat outside to enjoy the warm October weather (strange!). \u00a0Really enjoyed the guacamole (table side prep was nice but not necessary, just happy it was fresh). \u00a0Unlimited chips, fan of the salsa options they had.Both my girlfriend and I ordered fish tacos. \u00a0Some of the fish in my tacos was overdone and rock solid, but the pieces cooked properly were excellent. \u00a0My girlfriend's were cooked perfectly.Also had the nachos laredo and nachos al carbon. \u00a0Well done!",

    "text": "I don't usually associate 'gourmet' with 'Mexican' because Mexican food to me is homey, it is comfort food, it sticks to your ribs... \u00a0Cantina Laredo is located in a new development between Covent Garden and Leicester Square called St. Martin's Place. \u00a0They have outdoor seating, but they also have a surprisingly large amount of seating inside. \u00a0When we walked in, the host and the manager greeted us and the host asked if either of us would like the vegetarian menu. \u00a0That alone was pretty impressive to me, and while I would've like to look at it, let's be honest, I was going to have some meat.I usually opt for a bottle of Corona with my Mexican food... \u00a0it just seems to go well with it, but because of the atmosphere (and my date) we opted for a bottle of the house white wine. \u00a0Surprisingly, the wine was went very well with our meal. \u00a0Who knew?! \u00a0As I was having trouble deciding on what to have for dinner, I noticed behind us (literally right behind us... one sudden move and there could've been guac everywhere) one of the waitresses making fresh guacamole at the table. \u00a0Nice. \u00a0There were a lot of good dishes on the menu, and I will probably have to go back and try them all out, but I finally settled on the Chile Relleno. \u00a0My date opted for the Oaxaca Camarones Con Tocino... prawns wrapped with bacon. \u00a0The dishes are served with rice and sauteed vegetables, rather than rice and beans. \u00a0On one hand, no refried beans is a bit disappointing, but on the other hand, it was kind of nice to have something a lighter than refried beans. \u00a0I wanted to order some pico de gallo to have with our chips, but I didn't see it on the menu and didn't bother to ask.They brought us chips and two kinds of salsa, one was made with tomatillos and the other was a roasted red peper. \u00a0The tomatillo one comes warm, is a bit more tart, and is spicier than the roasted red pepper. \u00a0They were both nice, but I preferred the tomatillo salsa. \u00a0The chips came out warm and had just the right amount of salt on them! \u00a0Before our food came out, the table behind us had ordered a dessert... the Mexican Brownie, and they prepare this table side as well (again one sudden move and hot brownie and cold ice cream would've been everywhere). \u00a0Of course, we had made a mental note of this for later!Our food came out and it looked wonderful. \u00a0The sauteed veggies were corn with a little bit of carrots and zucchini. \u00a0The look of the rice made me skeptical that it would be flavorless, but it was pretty good, better than a lot of places, but could still use a bit of work. \u00a0The Chile Relleno was absolutely delicious. \u00a0I don't usually like raisins cooked, but they were a good addition to the dish, although I don't remember eating any almonds as the menu says. \u00a0And to those of you who are afraid of it because you think it will be spicy... its not. \u00a0The chile has a very mild, almost sweet flavor to it. \u00a0I did have a taste of the prawns and they were very nice as well... \u00a0I don't think I've ever had crispy bacon since I've been here in the UK, so the crisp bacon with the prawns was a nice surprise. \u00a0It came with some kind of sauce on the side, a green, tart, and spicy sauce. \u00a0I really liked it and kept dipping chips in it.Of course we decided we were going to check this brownie out (I have to go back and try the churros though). \u00a0The waitress brought a tray out with a hot iron plate, a plate with a chocolate brownie, vanilla ice cream (you can have it with cinnamon ice cream), and a small container of Mexican Brandy Butter. \u00a0She put the brownie on the hot iron plate, made a small place for the ice cream on top of the brownie, then she poured the brandy butter all around the plate causing it to sizzle and bubble up and making a wonderfully delicious smell. \u00a0The brownie was absolutely delicious... \u00a0it was moist, the center was warm, it was rich... delicious! \u00a0WARNING: \u00a0the brandy butter is delicious, but it is sticky and lava-like. \u00a0I say this because my date had the misfortune of dropping a bit of this on his arm (we had the plate between us sharing) and when he tried to wipe it off, it stuck to a small bit of hair on his arm... while continuing to burn him. \u00a0Let's just say he now knows what waxing feels like =(.The staff were very attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is great as well. \u00a0I will say that for a Mexican restaurant, I did find some of the dishes to be rather expensive... I mean I know it is supposed to be gourmet, but 13 quid for tamales... that's why it gets 4-stars instead of 5. \u00a0But still a great place for a date or a night out with friends.",

Yet here I sit, tantalised at the scooping and swooping, squishing and mixing my guacamole as I sat drooling into my 2-for-1 margarita (on the ice, no salt, shaken not stirred). Fresher than one fresh prince from the 90's, the guac itself makes this place worth a peek.On the other side of my meal, beef and chicken tacos, with the beef being the agreed upon best. The beef was juicy and cooked with more love than a taco typically gets. Surprise made this good meal great.Though the bill didn't burn a whole in my wallet, I would mark this as dinner for a special occasion, and I would certainly head there when 2-1 margarita deal is on. \u00a0Otherwise, skip the margarita and head to the pub.And get a shot of tequila.",

The inside is all earthy tones, low-hanging lamps and bowls of bright yellow lemons - gives the place a nice warming glow to welcome you in on a rainy winter's eve :)6 of us slid into one of the wooden window booths, with the veggies of the group chuffed to get their own veg menus. I was more interested in the drinks menu at this point and stuck to my personal rule of thumb: if in doubt, get the strangest-sounding thing on the menu. 10 mins later and my tastebuds were being pleasantly confused by an Avocado Passion (in case you were wondering, that's an avocado and passionfruit margarita).The food was also pretty good, and that's from someone who doesn't often find Mexican food in London very interesting. Obv you have to get the fresh guacamole so they can dazzle you with the at-table prep right in front of you. Ok it's basically just a guy mushing a load of stuff together on a tray (and ours could've done with more onion) but still somehow made it taste fresher!Aside from that we went for lots of other things to share, including some veggie tasting platters of which the star was the stuffed jalapenos. Tacos also got a repeat round ordered, and surprise hit from the sides was the sweet potato bake. Obviously we had to get desserts too, and shared an ok apple pie, tried to be authentic with churros (though they were served with chilli chocolate which my tastebuds haven't quite come round to yet), and last but best - a chocolate brownie served sizzling on a hot skillet mmm....Solid choice that I'd revisit if I was in the area - ended up spending a little more than planned with all the re-ordering (oops) but left feeling full and happy!",

However we came here with a huuuuge group for a friend's 30th birthday, and I was impressed with the way that they handled it.Good for Groups:- Our waitress was a complete star! She was friendly and helpful, and good and nudging people into making speedy decisions. - I liked that they made the guacamole in front of us...so it's nice and fresh- The set menu was pretty huge, and I like the way they brought out loooads of different starters and puddings for us all to share.Less good bits:- They were pretty slow to take orders/ bring food...but maybe that was just because there were so many of us?- They were not very flexible with big groups (they said if anyone didn't turn up, we'd have to pay for them anyway...which is a bit weird on a busy Saturday night)- It was quite expensive \u00a332 for the set menu (which we had to order as we were a group) plus drinks were \u00a39-\u00a310 each.",

Service is now comical; margaritas requested frozen were served on the rocks, specific tequila requests were mangled and when I explained wanted to redeem the \"Free Top Shelf Guacamole\" coupon I'd been sent by email it was met with skepticism about whether or not this could be used on a Saturday night.The chile con queso tasted as if double cream had been added to it (I love cream but in this instance it just made this normally bright and spicy dip taste flat and rather bland.)Unlike last time, the fajitas arrived sizzling solidifying them as my go to at Cantina Laredo. The purist's margarita was fairly faultless making it a drink I'd recommend. And the guacamole was as good as I remember it.Given that Hawksmoor, Dishoom and Bill's are all so close to Cantina Laredo in this area of Covent Garden, I'd be hard-pressed to choose this Tex-Mex import again unless they stepped up their game significantly.",

But don't let that put you off...good Mexican food is the draw and this place delivers.The guacamole made at the table is super gimmicky, but luckily was also delicious. I do recommend it. Can't give you a broad overview of the menu as my friend and I ate the same thing but I can say that everything we had was delicious.Chicken fajitas were lovely and the sides (particularly the cheesy potato thing) were especially delicious, if on the small side for the price. The wine was good and the desserts headed to tables around us looked fantastic - unfortunately we were too full to give them a try. The only downside was the price. At \u00a319 the fajitas were on the pricey side and, as mentioned before, you didn't get a lot of your side for a \u00a35+ price tag. Good food and nice service but, for Mexican, definitely not the best value. But then you are in the heart of theatre land and if you're a tourist you probably won't even notice.",

And the food ts good, but not as spectacular as I had once remembered. I had the vera cruz enchiladas and my bf had the chicken fajitas. The portions have gotten smaller and now you have to order side dishes (including rice) for most dishes (i.e. the enchiladas) separately, makes for quite a pricey meal. For my drink, I had a watermelon margarita which was fantastic, perfect balance of sweet and sour. You can see why margaritas are their speciality.If I were in the area and looking for somewhere nice to eat, then I might stop by Cantina Laredo again, but wouldn't make any special plans to go there.",

For the same price, there are a few other places off the top of my head where you can get tastier food and much better value. A few of those are actually walking distance from there!The restaurant was very busy and with no reservations, we waited about half an hour (not too bad!) There were no empty tables in sight and about 20 people waiting for a table at peak time. We were greeted with a smile at the door which made the wait bearable.Margaritas are \u00a39 which can quick increase your bill so I suggest drink wisely if you don't want to spend a lot just on drink. The menu highlights their signature dishes in red and we found ourselves ordering exclusively those items. We declined their freshly made at table guacamole as fro \u00a37-ish, we thought that was not such great value. Also good to note that mains do not come with sides. We enjoyed the food, but nothing really stood out. We spent just over \u00a350 for 2 drinks, 2 mains, a starter and 3 sides keeping in mind the portions are quite small. We were full but didn't think it was great value. The staff were lovely however so the overall experience was favourable.",

Had we had this meal in Texas, I would have rated it a 2.5 (if there were half stars) and we probably would not return to the restaurant, simply because there are so many other better Mexican restaurants in Dallas.We walked into the restaurant, put our name on the list, and went to the bar. Within seconds, complimentary chips and salsa appeared and the salsa was good. I love it when restaurants have warm (temperature) salsa. After waiting about 10 minutes, we were taken to our table. The service was great, especially for England.We started off with chips and queso and table side guacamole. The queso was good but it was of a strange consistency. It was almost like vanilla pudding but slightly thinner. It tasted just fine, however, my husband could not get past the texture and consistency. Our British friend thought the queso was divine as he had never had it before. As for the guacamole, it was a bit chunkier than I like and having perfected my own guacamole recipe, I've become a guacamole snob. I debated smashing it up further but refrained. It would have been great had it had lime juice and a little more salt. No worries though - we devoured the bowl.For the main, I shared chicken and beef fajitas with the Brit and my husband ordered one set of chicken quesadillas and one set of been quesadillas. He said that they were somewhat disappointing - they needed more sour cream (they were dressed with a dollop of sour cream and guacamole on top of each quesadilla slice). I think that he was simply disappointed because he wanted sour cream chicken enchilladas and they didn't offer that. The fajitas were good, however, the beef was chewy and hard to bite. I will get them again, however, will go with chicken only. I ordered a side of cheese and that cost an additional 1.25. Overall, tasty.The dress code is casual, you can easily get away with jeans and nice top or sweater even though the space is modern and a bit more upscale. The British friend who dined with us stated that the place lacked character (I also read this on the Yelp reviews). I personally loved the clean and modern space. It was a nice change from the small crapped restaurants you typically find in London.Keep an eye out for the gratuity that is already included in your tab (12%, if I remember correctly).",

    "text": "More like Can't-ina Laredon't. I feel like a huge joke has been played on me. There are a plethora of decent to good reviews from Americans stating that this place has the best Mexican in London. The only possible way this could be true is if a) they have only eaten at ONE Mexican restaurant in London, b) their idea of good Mexican food is average Mexican food from terrible American chain restaurants and/or food from Taco Bell or c) they've just really forgotten what good Mexican tastes like. After dining here I found out that this is actually one of those terrible American chain restaurants transplanted into London, so it's no surprise that I felt the way I did.We got there a bit early, so a few of us split the table guac and some of the tomatillo salsa. They were both actually tasty, but I'm not sure why the salsa needed to be served hot. The guac seems kind of expensive for about \u00a38 considering you see what they put in it, and it's literally one avocado and a bit of chopped up onion, tomato, chilies and cilantro. I also opted to have a couple of margaritas, and neither of them wowed me. Fairly standard and average margaritas. But wait, the best of the bunch (which still isn't amazing) comes in at a whopping \u00a312! For a fairly average margarita. So not worth the prices for the drinks.Knowing how easy it is to over-order at Mexican restaurants we opted to not get starters. Big mistake. For mains, I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas because I absolutely love mole sauce. I love it so much, I've hunted down good recipes and made it at home and kept it frozen for a rainy day. So when I see mole on the menu, I always get excited. My partner decided to get the steak wrapped around a shrimp stuffed pablano pepper. And we decided to share, because that's what we do. Then we ordered sides for the table, because SUPRISE! Unlike pretty much every other Mexican restaurant you will eat at, the sides are extra. Plus they come in at a value price of \u00a34 per side! We split four for the table as there were five of us eating. The food comes. Now for \u00a311 and no sides, I expected a pretty hefty serving of enchiladas. Nope. Don't expect that at all. I got two slightly larger than average enchiladas. Filled with bland, unseasoned shredded chicken (probably pre-cooked) covered in what turns out not to be a mole sauce but what can only be called a chocolate sauce. Now mole has a little bit of chocolate in it, but it's not a sweet, chocolately sauce. Where is the rich, development of flavors that Mexican cooking is known for? Clearly this chain has no idea what Mexican food is, yet somehow they're a massive American chain that has managed to set up a place in London. The beef was much better, but for \u00a320 and no sides, it's like the owners are just laughing at you while they put your money in the bank. Basically it seems they want to make the meal look cheaper by having the mains include no sides. So if you want one small side with your main, you're looking at an increased price, but given the size, you may have to go for two which is going to put your meal up to a minimum of \u00a320 most likely. For a plate of average Mexican food. Since we clearly didn't order enough food (because when does that happen at a Mexican restaurant? Here obviously), we all opted for dessert. I got the Mexican apple pie. So it comes out. It's presented nicely in a hot dish with a bubbling caramel sauce and ice cream. However, given this is the same dessert that is on the menu in the United States, it's definitely just shipped in and not made in house, and it definitely tasted like it as well. What a disappointment. If you do go here and get dessert, go for the ice cream. My partner had it, and that was actually a really nice trio of Mexican flavored ice creams: Tequila, Guava and Chocolate and Chili. For food like this, it's a solid 3 stars, if the prices were normal. However, they manage to make their mostly pre-cooked and pre-made food pretty and increase the price by making you pay extra for sides, chips and salsa. I really feel like the joke is on me with this place. They obviously know they've got a good thing going by their location, and their lack of caring really shows. Mexican should be about putting your heart and soul and love into your food, and here you just get sterile, nice-looking, bland food. Save your money and go someplace else. It's completely not worth the money you will spend here.",

Also, it has a veggie menu which always makes me feel special :) \u00a0I went two Tuesdays in a row and still feel like I would return next Tues ;) The decor and ambience is right up my alley and you can eat well for a good price if you pick well...The side of beans is a bargain at 75p and the drinks are fresh and flavourful. I really liked the stuffed jalapenos as they are home-made (which is sooo rare in London)... The veggie platter was decent - the cheese sauce made me want to give up giving up dairy - but hey ho!I will deffo return with the hubby and FYI - you get halfprice cocktails with your Yelp app! x",

I would give the rating a total of 5 starts, however, be cautious that while the food is of high quality so is the cost associated with eating here!In terms of atmosphere, I would suggest that you try and make a reservation ahead of time because in the evenings, especially weekends, this place has a history of getting busy. \u00a0Definitely recommend that you order the guacamole, which is made freshly at your table, and made to your liking. (i.e. ingredients, spice, etc.) I must stay that I've had just about everything on the menu and the only item I wasn't too fond of was the tamale plate. The tamale didn't taste have an authentic texture. Otherwise, the tacos, fajitas, stuffed jalape\u00f1os, etc were all good and highly recommend you try. The margaritas are some of the best I've had here in London and can pack a punch if you don't watch out! Highly recommend you try this place and even suggest having a group a friends join you as I did for my birthday!CheersLatino in London!",

    "text": "Another Tequila Tuesday adventure, this time inspired by a recommendation and some positive buzz on Twitter. My co-fonuder and I wandered through the streets of Soho until we found Cantina Laredo, and were seated as soon as we walked in. My first reaction was that this was a very sterilized Mexican place... there are lots of places with a lot more character, a lot more ethnicity, and a lot more reasonable prices.Also, given that I think this is connected to a hotel, it's more of a family establishment than many places I go in London. It felt a bit weird, as usually our TT adventures can be rowdy and I catch up with my friend over a margarita or two.We shared both the chips and salsa and the guacamole (which was too salty!), and I had the tacos for dinner. The portion was really small for the price... having been to lots of places which offer the same thing, I think I paid about twice as much at Cantina Laredo as others. That's painful, especially when the rest of the experience isn't blowing my socks off.Nonetheless, Cantina Laredo isn't bad. The food is good and flavorful, just overpriced. They have a really nice location and the service is excellent. It's just that I've got a list of places with way more \"Mexican\" to them that I can enjoy for a lot less.",

    "text": "A few weeks back, I went to review Cantina Laredo, who pride themselves on being the heart and soul of Mexican food! There is so much variety to chose from and I wanted to get an authentic taste of Mexico.The first dish to try out is was what Cantina is known for- their guacamole! Cantina serves 8 great guacamole, which awakens the taste buds with traditional guacamole and unusual twists of the loved dish. The choices are; Guacamole Cl\u00e1sico, Guacamole con Chile Habanero, Guacamole de Chicharr\u00f3n, Guacamole con Cangrejo, Guacamole con Chapulines, Guacamole de Pi\u00f1a, Guacamole de Poblano y Maiz.I was given the opportunity to make my own guacamole, which I enjoyed doing so. In the end, I and my friend made our own guacamole- Guacamole con Cangrejo. Which has Avocado, chipotle, red onion, jalape\u00f1o, jicama and coriander. Topped with white crab meat and citrus oil. Served with warm corn tortilla chips. However, if you're not daring with your taste buds then stick to the Guacamole Cl\u00e1sico which is made with Avocado, red onions, jalape\u00f1o, coriander, tomatoes and warm corn tortilla chips.Prepared at your table with a selection of salsa molcajetes and is both vegetarian and gluten-free. This is just a classic version of guacamole but is still big on flavour.We moved onto Entradas, which are small dishes to start with and are perfect for sharing. What I love about Cantina Laredo is that the dishes are suitable for different diets, whether you are vegetarian, or cannot eat certain dairy products like myself. My favourite Entradas dishes were the Camarones Rebozados, which are Tiger prawn tempura with chile and lime. The prawns are crunchy and full of flavour and are a great way to start your meal. Brochetas were brought, which are medium-sized dishes, which are also great for sharing. Cantina recommends two dishes per person to share. My favourite Brochetas to share are Mexican soy and chile de \u00e1rbol. Slightly more spicer in taste, but the steak is tender and exuding in flavour.Tacos are also a highlight of Cantina as there is a variety of tacos for both meat and vegetarian lovers. My favourite tacos would have to be Tacos de Pork Belly which is Pork belly, corn tortillas, salsa verde with coriander and onion salsa. I am a big fan of pork belly and Cantina got it completely right! The pork belly is soft and salty, giving the meat a savoury taste. My final taco was something different, Tacos de Pato con Mole which is Duck with Nutella mole, corn tortillas and plums. The combination of the Nutella, plum and duck is quite unusual but seemed to work well together in taste. However, after a few bites, the Nutella was a bit overwhelming and sickly.For mains, Cantina serve PLATOS FUERTES, Which are larger dishes, designed to share or eat individually. These dishes are not served with sides, so you will have to add sides separately, which is a bit inconvenient, however, it does give you the choice to design your main, according to your taste. For myself, I chose the Rib Eye-con Mantequilla de Habanero Which is the 28 days aged ribeye (270g) with yellow habanero butter. I added Arroz Rojo which is Mexican red rice. The steak is well marinated but is very spicy, whilst the Arroz Rojo is very similar in taste to my native country (Nigeria) rice, which made me enjoy the rice even more. Throughout the night, there were many choices of drinks to try from. My favourite drink of the night as to be the Pine for Patr\u00f3n, which is Pineapple infused Patr\u00f3n Silver, ancho chile shrub and lime. The presentation of this cocktail alone is aesthetically pleasing, served in a short glass, with a thick cube and the cocktail in the small silver patron bottle, to be served over the large cube of ice. This cocktail is strong and is definitely a signature cocktail to try out! Price: \u00a3\u00a3(Although the cocktails are quite pricey)",

The service was very friendly throughout if a little slow in parts (massive wait between starters and main, although every table in the place was full so i get that they were really busy). We had the guacamole to start (there are SO many to choose from). I had mine with crab meat which delicious, full of flavour with loads of chunky veg. OH had the blue cheese one which he said was good.The mains came and at this point we were glad we'd overdone the guac, the 'large plates' in particular were smaller than expected at the price of a regular main. The butter prawns were delicious but a lot spicier than expected, the enchiladas disappointingly flavourless.The cocktails were the highlight with loads of interesting flavours to choose from and nicely presented. Overall an enjoyable evening, sadly don't think it quite lives up to the price tag so I won't be rushing back.",

They weren't ready to seat us when we arrived so went to the bar for a drink while we waited. After waiting 15 minutes, our order was finally taken. We had been served one drink by the time our table was ready, so I waited for the remaining drinks to take them over. Another 20 minutes later they finally had them ready! The guy behind the bar had no glasses to serve them in so the process took forever!Once at our table, it took another 20 or more minutes to get anyone to take out order, of which they only took half of for starters. After waiting over 30 minutes, probably longer, they finally brought out our tacos. By this point, they still had not come back to take our main orders. We finally put our mains in and got those another 30+ mins later! It was Friday night, but this place should be able to manage the tables they have in a timely matter!Besides the horrible service, the tacos were good, although overpriced. Wouldn't expect much less in this area. We ordered a few tacos, the shrimp ones were quite good and the shredded beef ones were a bit dry, I didn't get to try the others as they went quick with our famished crowd. Their rice was also notably good, but I'll just end on the chile relleno...if you are expecting traditional cheesy goodness, do not order this! This must be some odd healthy take on a chile relleno stuffed with a quinoa mixture and NO cheese at all! I wouldn't say it was bad, but not my taste nor what I was hoping for.Oh and one more thing...the watermelon margarita is not good, but I'd recommend the avocado passion fruit one!",

    "text": "My husband, friend and I had an overall very pleasant experience here Friday night. First of all, the aroma of delicious Mexican food hits you when you enter which is always a good sign. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but NBD in the end.I got the chile en nogada (vegetarian) which was quite good- a bit of spice was a great addition to the mixed veggies in the creamy sauce. I highly recommend this dish. Also the avocado martini was perfect! My husband love his carne tacos but the patatas side dish it accompanies was terrible. The spice on top is just.... blech. My husband said it tasted fishy. We sent it back and the waitress kindly removed it from the bill. I got the asparagus in its place which was lovely. We shared the chocolate brownie with walnuts but my friend became alarmed when he bit into a shell. This time the manager came over to apologise and again, he removed the item from the bill.The service overall was much better than I typically experience at London establishments. The prices were fair.",

    "text": "Pushy and unhelpful service, overpriced, variable quality food -- some amazing, some underwhelming.Had a strange experience with the service. \u00a0The waiter was pushy in saying that we should order more and more things, without listening to our preferences. \u00a0'Are you sure you don't want a small plate too?' \u00a0'You should also order rice.' \u00a0(We don't want rice.) \u00a0'Here this rice dish is good.' \u00a0'Want a drink?' (No.) 'Our margaritas are made with fresh ingredients.' .... Made the whole experience feel like we were listening to a salesman.Anyways the guacamole small dish (prepared at the table side) was very tasty, as was the vegetarian burrito. \u00a0The veggie fajitas were forgettable, especially as the guacamole offered with that was no good. \u00a0Strange to have such variable quality of the same thing on the table! \u00a0Overall, for the quality of food, it was definitely overpriced. \u00a0They do some margarita specials (2 for 1) on Wednesday and Saturday ... probably best to come just for those and grab some table side guac. \u00a0Leave the rest for one of the other Mexican restaurants around town.",

SUPER COOL...walking in the ambiance was nice. It's on the higher end of the Mexican Food spectrum. This is a pricey place, but the appetizers all looked pretty delicious. I ordered the ceviche, but I was extremely disappointed with the portion sizes. It was tiny! The presentation was beautiful but it was SO SMALL. \u00a0Service was pretty good, but when paying for the bill, the server wanted everyone to pay with card to make it easier. Also, she have me the incorrect change, I didn't want to deal with that fiasco so I didn't complain. I might come here again, but then again, the food didn't blow me away plus price wise, I'm not sure if it is worth it. Especially when I'm from Southern California and the MEXICAN FOOD THERE IS AMAZING!",

    "text": "Hmm, so I have to admit id heard many, many good things about this place and so was super excited to check it out. When I went there, they had no tables and we had to wait for almost half hour which at 7pm in an evening, I can understand. My and my friend rather awkwardly sat at the cramped bar while we waited, drinking a cocktail each. He ordered an avocado one, which he assured me tasted nothing like avocado at all and I ordered a fruity drink, which was nice but didn't blow my socks off.When we finally got a table, we browsed the menu for a while before deciding to order. I opted for the chicken stuffed with prawns and he went for the salad. My chicken was amazing but was just that!! A chicken breast on the plate with no sides. Luckily I had opted for a side of rice, so I meant I wasn't leaving hungry but at almost 15 pounds for this, I thought it was a tad overpriced. The salad was enormous and with chicken came to around 10 pounds and so I thought it was a far better dish for a main course. We did get a side of guacamole, but not the demonstration, as I watched at the table beside me and whilst it was good, I didn't think it warranted double the price to see.All in all, the meal was just ok and came to almost 75 pounds for a main each and a few drinks. If you want Mexican, I think you'd have far better food if you tried chilangos or chipotle and save a hella lotta money.",

The waiters where very nice and friendly and the drinks where made very well.Definitely a place to go in London if your craving some good Mexican food.",

I wasn't sure if it would be the same. It was fantastic and brought back many memories of home. The salsa was authentic and great and the margaritas were equally as impressive. For my main I had Pork Tamales. Absolute fantastic. The flavours were great and very much what I expected as one who grew up on TexMex. If your are a Brit looking for a taste of Texas, this is it. If your are a Texan visiting London, this is a little slice of home.",

Unfortunately much like the interior design the food and the service we had was pretty average. I eat a fair bit of Mexican food and found meals from places such as Poncho 8 and Chilango were superior to the salad and enchilada that we ate. The service was OK but it felt very much like a chain restaurant despite the fact it isn't from what I can see. \u00a0Admittedly we visited on a Monday evening so maybe we caught them on a quiet night as it seems most reviews are positive.",

Cocktails are great: I've been here a few times and have always been pleased with the freshest ingredients mixed to quench your thirst. I highly recommend the guacamole starter -- they make it at the table in front of you. \u00a0The vegetable enchiladas were perfectly done, not too much cheese, and vegetables still holding a bit of firmness. My friend had an enchilada or burrito with a chocolate laced sauce which she said was divine. Desserts ....oh to salivate thinking of them.....I've uploaded a picture of the sizzling brownie & ice cream. \u00a0The only thing that lets this place down are the value of the side dishes, as the price is a bit high (\u00a33.50) for small sides of rice or vegetables. \u00a0However that's a bit of a blip, don't let it stop you from visiting.",
