    "text": "I think the other reviewer encapsulated it perfectly in saying 'a good bar when it's not too busy'. On the plus side, it feels like a traditional pub, with lots of wood and an island counter at ground level. There are plenty of chairs and tables (more on this later) and they serve real ale, which seems well enough kept - I suspect turnover is pretty fast, which helps. Not a bad choice of beers, either. The downside is that it gets horribly busy in the period after work, between 5pm and 7pm. It became a bit of a squash to move about and I found groups of people getting quite territorial 'saving' chairs for friends who didn't turn up for half an hour, that sort of thing: we've all done it, I suspect, but when it's this busy and their friends haven't arrived, I'd be embarrassed to bag the furniture for this long. Service also slowed up somewhat at the bar. My real disappointment was, however, with the food. They didn't have my first two choices, so my third choice was chicken salad with avocado. The chicken was a bit tough, but OK, but worst was the avocado: it was clearly not ripe, and had the texture of hard rubber. You couldn't cut it, never mind eat it. Not good enough for \u00a37. It was also slow arriving, but they warned me about that. I would have complained at the time, but it was so busy that it was not conducive to such a conversation, so I just cut my losses and left. There are several other pubs around, so this wouldn't be my first choice - and I'd eat somewhere else.",

One evening, the Tavern's infectious jovial atmosphere persuaded me to do a series of shots and then throw back two car bombs (a full pint of Guinness with two shots of Bailey's) in quick succession, to the delight of my fellow patrons. I subsequently tripped along some cobbled streets to a bench that afforded a view of St. Paul's and listened to the river lap against the embankment walls for an hour. Then I started whining for a chicken curry, and became inconsolable when I found that the shop near the tube that sold my beloved Cadbury snacks had closed for the evening. Southwark Tavern easily lends itself to a cheap, fun night of boozing, and I wouldn't trade that night for anything.",

The actual building itself is beautiful and has been renovated to create a trendy yet unpretentious feel to the place. As with its neighbour the Market Porter, due to lack of inside seating, everyone tends to pile outside onto the street which is nice in the summer but not so great in the winter. The pub has a good range of beers such as Leffe Belgian beer and the bar staff are young and friendly. As for the food, I wasn't really very impressed as it is expensive for what you get and you tend to wait....and wait....and wait for it to arrive. It is one of the more sociable pubs that I have been to however, and because it gets busy so quickly, you do find yourself chatting to people whilst waiting to get served at the bar.",

Again, not life changing but reliable. Fish isn't overcooked. Chips were a little dry. Sausage and mash hit the spot... the chocolate and salted caramel tart is definitely one of the reasons I keep going back, it's probably not even all that fancy but it's delicious. The only thing it fails at is being standout. Had you put this a mile or so north in the middle of dodgy-Wetherspoons territory there'd be another star here. However set against the backdrop of Borough Market it seems to pale a little. On the doorstep of some fantastic producers and truly unique offerings it just doesn't seem enough for this pub to be plodding along the way it does. Perhaps it just needs to have a little confidence and show off. Put it this way: it's opposite the Brindisa tapas restaurant. It needs to up its game. It's almost there, it's just got to catch up with everything around it.",

    "text": "Located a short walk from the ever-popular Borough Market, The Southwark Tavern attracts a mixed crowd of shoppers, students, professionals and locals. \u00a0On the weekends especially this place will be filled to overflowing so if you're looking for a quiet drinking spot then this probably isn't the place. \u00a0Those who brave the crowds will find themselves in a traditional/trendy bar sporting comfy sofas, lots of original features and a gorgeous square bar. \u00a0Set over two floors the upstairs is a more standard pub environment while the downstairs space provides an intimate nightspot with lots of hidey holes and corners.The atmosphere here is always top-notch and a constant buzz surround the place spurred on in part by the excellent food and drinks available.The menu is packed with a variety of gastropub cuisine with a leaning towards traditional English cooking albeit prepared with some very fine ingredients from the nearby marketplace.Drinks-wise there is a massive range of bottled and draught lager available as well as a good variety of wines and spirits which, like the food, come in at very reasonable prices.A great place to stop in pre or post-shop. \u00a0Not too sure what the evenings are like here but The Southwark Tavern strikes me as a place that caters more to afternoon and early evening drinkers and diners.",

They serve decent beers, including Budvar, Staropramen, and Fr\u00fcli, plus an interesting range of bottled beers. Upstairs can feel a little cramped, as there is not much seating or standing area, and it always seems to be pretty full even early on in the week. It can take a while to get served at the bar. Downstairs there are some larger tables, and also a series of what seems like prison cells! Each one of these cells has a table and seating for about 8 people, which can be a lot of fun if you are able to get one. The food is a little expensive, but pretty good. I've only ordered food once on a Friday lunchtime, and it took over 45 minutes to arrive, although we were warned that this would be the case beforehand. A good bar when it's not too busy.",

They put small bread crumbs on the top of it which mix well with the sauce and the cheese and give it more of a complete taste. It is not too cheesy which is great and the sauce doesn't overmix well with the rest of the dish. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetables but the grilled zucchini and squash were pretty good and even better with the lasagna.",

The salt and pepper squid with lime mayo was thinly battered and had a soft bite to it. My smoked trout-egg salad had a nice ratio of protein and fresh veggies. Bf's beer battered haddock and chips were fairly decent, the fish was a bit bland but the crispiness made up for it, well, that and the malt vinegar we doused it with.
