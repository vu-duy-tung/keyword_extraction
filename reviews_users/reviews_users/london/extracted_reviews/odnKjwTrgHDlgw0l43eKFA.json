    "text": "I have always believed that the U.K. was put on the planet so we'd all know what good fish and chips were supposed to taste like. Over the past few years there has been a great decline of the corner chip shop all over the island. I suspect this is in part to do with the emergence of fast food outlets of a different ilk. McDonald's, KFC, Burger King litter the streets with offerings of cheaper and faster food. It goes like it goes. Having fish & chips in England was the No. 2 item on my list (right behind High Tea) because as a transplanted Scot here in Canada good old fish & chips for me was all about comfort and childhood memories. I searched through the Yelp UK listing hoping to find that 4 - 5 star spot that would sate my lust for this traditional British fare. Let me introduce you to the Golden Hind. For the life of me I cannot figure out where this name came from but what I can tell you is that this is the way fish & chips were meant to be served up. The Golden Hind is located on Marylebone Lane, a back street in a small bistro eating district. Stepping in to this place is like being in a time warp. It is small, seating only about 30, and I'm pretty sure all the fixtures are original. I was home at last! I went straight for the Haddock & Chips with mushy peas, a true, true British tradition and the Golden Hind didn't disappoint. A huge piece of fish, hot & crispy but not \"battery\" but rather almost just flowered and deep fried, covered the better part of half my plate. It was pure fish manna. The chips were large chunks fried to that bright golden yellow. When we were ordering I asked for a glass of wine (the couple next to us had a bottle on their table) and the waiter/owner told me they weren't licensed. I was really surprised when he said to me that it was a BYOB and that there was a nice little shop just a few doors down that had some decent wine if I wanted to nip down and grab a bottle. Corkage was a mere couple of pounds ($5). I was in shock. Toronto restaurants could take a cue from a place like the Golden Hind. From the minute I stepped in, to the minute I stepped out, there was nary an empty table. That is a testament unto itself. In a city that has a reputation for being one of the most expensive cities in the world, that dinner cost us $35.00 Oh Golden Hind....I miss you already.",

This restaurant was recommended to us for fish and chips and while the menu was basic, there are a variety of fish and you can have it steamed or fried. A tip: alcohol is not served here, but you can bring in your own. We didn't know this and our waiter directed us to a liquor store where we bought a bottle of wine. I would come back and bring visitors. Servers were rushed, but also very friendly.",

The first time i went here was on a date in which I had no idea what to expect and was a bit nervous since it was my first dinner date with this fellow. Anyways we arrived at this cute little place that was quite packed. My bf had brought his own wine and they were right on top of it in which they brought out glasses and poured it for us as well. The service was wonderful. I was told by my bf to get the mushy peas... now I'm not a big fan of peas, so i was a bit weirded out when I heard not only are we getting peas but they're gonna be mushy.... wasn't too excited for those, but we'll see what happens. Then the food came out. It was one of the best things I had seen in awhile. The chips were big and perfectly fried, the fish was HUGE and amazingly delicious and I have fallen in Love with mushy peas. I ended up eating almost the whole thing right then and there. The food is great, the atmosphere is great, the service is great and it makes for a wonderful evening. i have been to this place many times now and always bring visitors here as well. It's by far the best fish and chips place in London.",

I have brought wine which they quickly set up glasses and popped the bottle for me. I have brought beer to which they brought pint glasses to pour into. I have brought nothing and they pointed me to the nearest liquor shop across the street upon my query.If you're ever around Oxford St and are feeling peckish, you would be delighted to step in and rediscover fish and chips.",

With all the notions of English food not being tasty and London being expensive, this place did its best to nix these notions. I had a large portion of the fish and chips with mushy peas and and a dessert of treacle tart. The entree food was amazing and probably the best version of fish and chips I had in London and was cheap considering theLarge portion sizes. The dessert was alright but I tend to like sweeter items so itMay have just been me. On top of the great food, the service was also great as we had a very friendly waiter and even took a picture with him to document our first meal in London.

So, the food quality is good, and the service was just fine. A couple of gripes - beer and wine would be a great addition to the menu. \u00a0The lighting in the new annex to the left as you walk in is way too bright. The lack of music makes the ambiance downright awkward - everyone was speaking in hushed tones, you thought you were in a doctor's waiting room. Also, the ice cream was a bit freezer burnt. However, all of these gripes can be overlooked because the place is BYOB (I wish I had known that before) and the fish & chips are legendary.",

    "text": "Summary: GREAT fish n chips, good desserts, mediocre appetizers/starters. One of the better fish n chips in the areaThe Place: The restaurant is larger than you'd expect from the pictures. It has a large main dining area and a basement that serves as a private room for larger parties/events. The dining atmosphere looks nice and is decorated well, but is still a casual atmosphere. The atmosphere isn't the main attraction here, but it is a nice place. The service was great, very attentive, quick, and friendly.The Food: Let's start with the starters...they were somewhat small and we shared most of them to sample as many as possible. The calimari was stringy but tasty, and had a perfectly golden crusted fried coating. The fish cakes were somewhat mushy, but had a good flavor even though not visually stunning. The fried feta looked delicious, but the strong flavor of feta was a bit overwhelming inside the lightly fried crust.The main course, Haddock and chips, was absolutely delicious. It was perfectly cooked, and had a harder fried crust than many fish n chips I've had in the US. The fries were hit or miss, with an occasional soggy few. This is one of the better fish n chips I've had, and the portions were gigantic. Especially after having a starter, it's difficult to finish the fish n chips here.The desserts were all incredible, we again ordered one of each to sample them all. The sponge cakes were delicious, most notably the chocolate sponge cake with ice cream. The bread pudding was soggy and not as flavor packed, but all of the other desserts were delicious. By far, the best one was the chocolate sponge.The Value: The fish and chips came out around 10-13 pounds, and desserts and starters were around 3-5 pounds. The main course is absolutely worth it, and you get large portions and a great value for such a delicious plate. The appetizers were not worth the price for their lower quality and smaller portion sizes. The desserts were all delicious, but somewhat pricey as well, so I'd suggest getting one or two for the table to share.",

    "text": "I fear fish-and-chips is in the category of steak: there's only so good it can be.In its essence, there are very few variables, and while that limits the downside, that also limits the upside.Compare to a sandwich: there are trillions of combinations of all the inputs, so the final output can be quite varied, and you can be delighted or disappointed...dazzled or disgusted. Fish and chips, like steak, has few inputs. Once you're at the level where you're using good quality fish, fresh hot oil, and a consistent batter, then you've sort of hit your ceiling. The food here was quite good, to be sure, but because this is the best reviewed place, and all the Elites are saying 'best i've ever had.' one cannot help but be slightly disappointed at the fact that, at its essence, it's still a deep fried whitefish. And even in it's best form (which this might be), it lacks the complexity and flavor of a panko coated dijon salmon, or a sesame seared ahi.The chips were interesting: crisp on the outside; soft and dense on the inside. But again: lacking the seasoning of steak fries and the crispness of frites.Great, friendly, and efficient service.",

    "text": "I came to London in February hoping to enjoy the Fish and Chips at the Golden Hind. I was sort of disappointed and thought that perhaps I need to re-visit what great Fish and Chips really are. Here are my qualifications:-A CRISPY batter that is golden and will nearly break your teeth upon crunching down on it (of course, I exaggerate, but I want it crispy!). No soggy batter lurking on the inside.-Fresh soft fish.-Golden, fluffy chips that are crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar.Someone mentioned earlier that the Golden Hind's service was joyless. I also found this to be the case. They were certainly not welcoming and although they had many tables without a reserved sign, they questioned everyone who came through the door if they had a reservation and then wandered over to closely placed tables and squished everyone in. I can appreciate that they are busy and have to seat the reservations, but come on-- a reservation for Fish and Chips? I agree as well, with another poster, who said that his local pub has better Fish and Chips. And at the pub, the chips and peas are included in the price.The fish was, indeed, fresh. Honestly though?If I have a great piece of fish, I'm not going to cover it in batter and deep fry it. I'll sautee and roast it with lemon and capers. As long as it's not reeking-- serve it up for fish fry! Overall, I would say the flavour was just okay. My bill, for for a large Cod with Chips and peas was over 15 pounds! The pub is way cheaper and much better.Sorry, Golden Hind, But you're lacking in environment, value and a few other things that might lead me to rave about your place.Next time I'm in London, I'll stick to the pub and a pint.",

Americans love salt, fat and grease, so when you read callous reviews that London food sucks - they mean add salt, fat and grease.Excellent fish. I had the haddock fried with chips, man had the cod fried with chips and we shared a side of mushy peas. The breading wasn't greasy at all. In fact, it was dry, light with just the right crunch. The fish was moist and flaked off easily with the slightest touch of the fork. I recommend a heavy hand with the malt vinegar. Yum. Huge portions for roughly \u00a311 each. The side of mushy peas for under \u00a33 was divine. I could have had another full order on my own.Very sweet staff and mixed clientele of devoted locals and tourists (with European accents). We had a table overlooking a trendy French restaurant across the street and \u00a0laughed at the line that was wrapped around the building and down the street. We checked it out and learned it was voted Trip Advisor's top pick for 2012, however, it's numbered rating was further down the line than The Golden Hind. So, ha! Highly recommend! Great value per London standards. BYOB, which we didn't know beforehand. Again, if you are looking for salt, fat and grease, McDonald's offers a hockey puck (I mean filet o fish) to nosh on.",

I do wish it were slightly less convenient to my office; the temptation has me worried for my figure!",

    "text": "My first review of 2015 goes to The Golden Hind. It was the best fish and chips I have ever tasted. It was a Tuesday night and we were the first to arrive at 7 PM, greeted by the very friendly owner himself. We chatted a bit and as soon as we told him we are Canadian, he stepped into his kitchen and came out with a picture of himself with Stephen Harper. Apparently Harper dined at The Golden Hind just six months ago, and a lot of Air Canada crew members frequently dine here as well. While waiting for our food, we also noticed a lot of locals were popping in and out to order take-out. That's when you know this place is good. We ordered cod and haddock, with salad and a side of gherkin (pickled cucumber). It seems like they used to give the option of a large or small portion for the fish, but now, there's only one size to choose from and the portions are big! The fish was very fresh, tasty, and so crispy... I hope I can eventually find fish and chips in Toronto that is just as good as The Golden Hind.Simply put...friendly staff, filled with locals, simple menu, decent prices, big portions, and very delicious fish and chips. I will definitely be back next time I am in London!",

Family-operated (with a plaque on the wall showing the history going back to 1914!!), the fish was fresh and yummy and flaky and light and delicious! My uncle has a thing about his food and his chips being extra hot, he always asks that the plate be hot (and if he's having chips, that they are extra hot) whenever he dines out. Sadly, this was overlooked by the waiter. A little while later, the owner came by and it was mentioned - he immediately brought us a fresh bowl of insanely hot chips.As mentioned elsewhere, this restaurant does not have a liquor or beer license (too much hassle, I am told), but they have no problem with BYOB and in fact are quite happy to return glasses to the pub on the corner. Bonus!This is a very small restaurant and they tend to not take reservations, so expect a wait. And expect that people may well be standing and waiting right next to your table while you're eating.",

The menu covers the normal array of fish offerings. We opted for one order of cod and one order of halibut (steak). The portions were very generous. More than we could eat. The cod had a good crust on it and was light and flaky. The halibut was a thick cut with a good fishy taste. Perhaps not the fish for everyone. We loved it! The chips were crisp and plentiful. One quick note - the place is BYOB. Don't think I knew that before we arrived.N&joy",

I was able to get a seat quickly and the menu is truly quite simple. I ordered the basic to try (also as a standard, when I try other places): Cod & Chips. (By the way, they no longer have the prawn in garlic sauce in starters section). The servers were friendly, efficient, and the order came quickly. And I have to say, I'm a fan. The fish is done really well and without all the extra oil that can make me sick. The portions are decently large - I can finish it all but I'm stuffed in the end. I'm in no way a fish and chips expert, especially since there are so many fish and chips restaurant in London, but after trying Golden Hind, its a place I would recommend to my friends and a place I would go back again. So I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fish & chip place in London.",

Me and planner foodie bowl in. Packed but there's a table free and we grab it. The place is full of regulars it feels to us. Lots of old kooky looking people who live around the area engaging the owners in bizarre conversation. The surroundings are sparse, a few historical pictures on the wall. It's functional. But that's the beauty. They have a sign on the wall there which informs you who the owners have been since the place started nearly 100 years ago. Three Italian families and two Greek. The place is buzzing. We order 2 cod and chips and I get a cup of tea. Gav orders bread and butter too. Proper.The dish that came out was excellent. Large cod was battered thinly and crisply and was as close to perfect as you could want. Chips were slightly underdone I thought and there were probably a few less than I would have liked but the fish was big and I'm just greedy. Accompanying tartare sauce was excellent and complimentary. The tea was just how I ordered. Strong. Not much milk. Hangover not cured but certainly massaged. This place is a must. The whole area is fascinating and worth a wonder round and this place is full of history, provides a warm welcome and furnishes you with the most excellent fish and chips. Eat in for a tenner. Can't say fairer. The full five stars.",

Sadly, the ladies next to us were infuriated because they weren't served for a half hour after they ordered. Pity. Food-wise, we ordered the fried feta for starters. Heavenly, and should replace mozzerella sticks as a normal appetizer. Then, since I wanted to be slightly healthy, I got steamed cod and garden peas (no worries, I've had normal fish and chips before. Didn't want anymore friendness, though).

And boy did they deliver. Fish was wonderfully fresh, not greasy. Peas were pure comfort. Chips were the only downside but who cares. With all the hustle bustle going on in there staff still had time to joke a bit. All sorts from regulars to tourists to suits like me. and 12 pounds before tip!Perfect. Yummy.",

Still didn't taste of anything. I tried dousing it with vinegar. \u00a0Still didn't taste of anything.I tried eating it with ketchup.It only tasted vaguely of ketchup.How is this possible? \u00a0It defies the laws of physics and chippies. \u00a0Plus, the chips were kind of dry.Take it from me, the Golden Hind is NOT the best fish and chips you'll ever have. \u00a0Hell, it's not even the best fish and chips you'll ever have in London (which is a city not known for having good fish and chips in the first place).",

    "text": "The Golden Hiney. So much has been said about it on Yelp, I felt that I really needed to see what all the fuss was about! And you know what? I still don't know!I guess The Golden Hind must be very highly rated in a lot of American restaurant guides of Foggy London Town... While eating here, it had the same vibe as The House Of Nanking in San Francisco - \"I am here with a load of other people that are eating food that a book/website told them was the best, therefore they CAN NOT disagree\".However: *I do have my own tastebuds, many of them in fact.*I have a watch. I can tell that I waited nigh on an hour for a table. In the rain.*I have eaten fried fish before. I can notice that it was not as chunky and white as many other restaurants.*I found it to be a pain to 'bring my own bottle'. We were in Marylebone not Macclesfield.In the defence of The Golden Hind, I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. However, this must be down to the fact that out of neccessity, they must change the oil frequently, so by extention, great tasting F&C's is helped MASSIVELY by high footfall and fresh ingredients. Well, the two highlights of my time there were - 1) Seeing Bill Nighy in there.2) My friend balancing a full glass of red wine on the back of my hand while I was sending a text. Guess what? It fell off.All in all - great tasting food, but for the money, I have had way better.",

Not too far, and not to expensive. I ordered takeaway and ate it nearby at Cavendish Gardens. I ordered - small battered cod and small chipsIT WAS MASSIVE. It lasted me for two servings. I really enjoyed the tartar sauce, but the fish and chips lacked some seasoning. Thankfully, I sprinkled some pepper before I left and brought some salt packets. YAY! After that, the fish was pretty delish! It was oily (as expected) and very hearty. All in all, solid place. Take this review with a grain of salt (as you will need it with the fish) since I've never had fish and chips elsewhere so I have no comparison. Cheerio!",

Also, this place gets packed - super fast - probably because it's one of the most popular places to eat F&C.

It's not the healthiest place and even though you can get a steamed piece of fish all of the sides are on the 'comfort' food side of things. There is a lot of deep fried. I'm pretty sure everything on the starters list is from the frier. But if that doesn't bother you then get involved. It's a little on the pricey side but being able to byo makes up for that. The mushy peas side was definitely my highlight and the tartare sauce is delicious. Lots of good wine bars and pubs to go to after in the area.",

    "text": "I saw this on a list of best BYOs in London so it was only a matter of time before i came to check it out. I had a bit of trouble finding it, as I walked into the Golden Eagle pub one street down by accident, and my friend had even more trouble because Marylebone Lane has a break in it and is not the easiest road to follow. But we got there in the end, with plenty of tourists did as well, so it must be featured in quite a few travel guides. One fellow diner even opened up his book and pointed to a picture of what he wanted to order!The restaurant lacked character for a place that seems to be a cultural institution, resembling a canteen with very little decoration on the wall and tables of 2 and 4. I think it would be difficult to come here with a large group because the restaurant can only seat 50-60 people. Their opening hours are only for a few hours each day so I wasn't able to call ahead and make a reservation, but I don't think they would be the type to take reservations in any case. We walked in and there were a few empty tables at the time so we were seated right away. As for the food, we ordered calamari to start and I got the fried cod and my friend got the fried haddock. There is an option to get it steamed, but I saw it on someone's plate and it didn't look all that great. There were about 7 options for fish and chips actually had to be ordered as a side, along with a few other items like peas or salad. We just got the chips as a side, and they were solid, good chips. The calamari was in sticks and tasty but nothing special. But I really enjoyed the cod, I would definitely recommend it!The service was great as well. There were at least 4 or 5 servers attending to diners and I never had a problem asking for water or more sauce. When we put our wine bottle on the table, someone came over with a corkscrew right away. And I was expecting there to be a 1 pound corkage fee, but that never showed up on our bill. Cheap night - in all, our meal was less than 25 pounds, which is less than most bottles of wine in a restaurant!",

It could be because we're American, and possibly haven't had proper fish and chips before, but we both absolutely loved it. \u00a0The cod was excellent quality and had great texture (it tasted and looked fresh) and it was perfectly battered. The french fries (or chips) were also very good, they were a good amount of both crispy ( on the outside) and soft (on the inside). Along with loving the taste of the food, I also loved the restaurant as a whole. It was one of the cheapest places to eat at in this area, and you get a good amount of food for the price you're paying. I was also loving the atmosphere of the place. When we first walked in, we were greeted and seated by an older gentleman (possibly the owner or a manager). He was very pleasant and we made small talk when he took our order. My husband and I were watching everyone around us and lots of people seemed to know other people in the restaurant, so it seems like they get a ton of regulars.Anyway, we loved this place and if we were going to be in the area longer, we'd probably eat here again. I definitely recommend eating here.",

    "text": "109 reviews, averaging 4 stars.. the Golden Hind must be doing something right! \u00a0I've eaten here 3 times already (both dine-in and takeaway), and have never been disappointed in the fish. Luckily, when I dined in, I was able to snag a table right away, but I've never been caught waiting in a queue. \u00a0If you get there during prime time and its busy (as usual), expect to wait about an hour to get a table. \u00a0I tried the calamari and prawns + garlic - as Alex mentioned, very disappointing, I'm 99% sure they are pre-bought frozen stuff.. so avoid their appies altogether, don't bother wasting stomach space or money on this! \u00a0Onto to good stuff: the fish! There are a number of different fish offered, either fried or steamed. \u00a0I opted for the cod all 3 times. \u00a0The batter is light and crispy, not too greasy, and the oil didn't taste old. \u00a0Unfortunately, chips are an add on, and you can't eat fish and chips with the chips... can you? \u00a0Yeah, you can.. trust me! \u00a0The chips are nothing to rave about. \u00a0They've always been underseasoned (maybe its a London thing, where they don't salt the chips and leave it up to me.. if this is the case, then fine :) ), or incredibly mushy... a big disappointment there. \u00a0Size doesn't matter... does it?? In this case, not really! \u00a0When you order takeaway, you can choose to have a small or large piece. \u00a0If you're eating in, the fish you get is a very generous portion, so I'm assuming the large is the default when you eat in. \u00a0I usually have a monster appetite, but even I have my limits when it comes to fried food. \u00a0I could hardly finish off the small, so if you were to have a drink and possibly dessert / ice cream afterward, then you're set! \u00a0The difference comes down to pricing: its incredibly cheap to do takeaway here! \u00a0\u00a34.50 for small, \u00a36.50 for large. \u00a0\u00a31.70 if you want chips. \u00a0Otherwise, if you eat in, I believe you will be paying around \u00a39.50 for (large) fish, \u00a32(ish) for chips, and a side of mushy peas. \u00a0Pretty steep! \u00a0I've been doing takeaway - but where to eat? \u00a0Don't be fooled by Manchester Square on Google Maps - its locked up and accessible by those who have keys to it. \u00a0This might not be the classiest move, but if you walk down Thayer Street (at Hind street), there are 2 park benches on the corner. \u00a0I usually plunk myself down there and chow down before the fish gets cold! \u00a0So all in all: grab the fish as a takeaway, and if you really need chips, just go to McD's and pick up fries afterwards. \u00a0Its much more satisfying! Don't miss out!*** Closed on Sundays ****** BYOB !!! ***",

The only downside is that, for fish and chips (even quality fish and chips) the prices are rather steep. I suppose diners pay for the location as much as for the meal, which many seem happy to do. I'm certainly one of those happy to fork a little extra knowing the meal will be wonderful and served in such a unique setting. I mean really, the Golden Hind is an extraordinary little eatery (with a time forgotten quality) and everyone reading this review should definitely sit within the grandeur of its pre-World War One interior. And if you don't like fish (or chips) just get a cup of tea or a satisfying pud.",

The cod was tender on the inside with a crunchy exterior. The chips were similar. It was certainly better than what I've had in Canada.

They manage to emulate that same crispity crunchety flavorful fish without being, you know, gross. \u00a0Ye Olde GH isn't at all what I expected. I imagine tucking into fish and chips at a scarred wooden table, worn brocade seats, tucked in a corner at some pub but this restaurant is bright, open and BYOB. We sat and ordered our haddock, mine a small, his a large. Both of us got chips. Neither of us got peas. I ran to Tesco (just down the street) to get us some beverages. Note: There is a pound charge if you bring your own but it's still much cheaper than actually buying drinks at a bar. \u00a0Two gigantic pieces of Haddock, a pile of chips and some cold beers later, we were stuffed and happy and ready for the next cocktail. Golden Hind is a fantastic fish and chips experience that you owe your fried food loving heart.",

In fact for what I got, they were way too high.Set in the trendy area of Marylebone Lane, The Golden Hind is a kickback to where most cafes and fish and chip shiops in London cosisted of hard chairs and formica topped dining tables.The basic environment actually lent well to the food it serves. I felt sure that my fish and chips would be exceptional - They were not! I ordered a portion of chips with battered Plaice. Th plaice tasted good, but the batter was to thick for me. There just seemed too much batter in relation to the white of the fish itself. The chips were also too dry for my liking, and warm rather than hot. I used a lot more tartar sauce than I would normally, to detract from the dryness of the meal. The cup of tea I had looked like a proper builders strong tea, but rather than coming up in a good builders size cup, it was served in quite a small cup with saucer.At \u00a315 including service, to me it was not good value. In act when we left, we passed the new Ivy Cafe, also on Marylebone Lane. They offer a fish and chip meal including mashed peas for \u00a314.50. I think I might be trying their fish and chips next time.",

So off we went after a full day exploring London and a side trip to Abbey Road to have a picture taken crossing the iconic crosswalk from Beatles' Abbey Road album cover. The place was a bit of a challenge to locate as TA wasn't that accurate, but we managed to find the place.My wife and I had high expectations for this place. It was busy when we got there but we were seated promptly and shown the menu. After briefly consulting the server, we both opted for cod and shared an order of chips with some water. The fish served were in large portions...it had a nice crunchy outside and fresh and flaky inside...if not a bit on the oily side. We were expecting to be \"wowed\" but came away unimpressed. We both thought the fish lacked flavor...maybe because we've grown accustomed to American beer battered fish that is full of flavor...and this fell short of our expectations. Additionally, we felt service at this place seemed detached.We both felt the food was OK...but definitely not something to go out of your way for.",

So much so that i went back twice in 3 days. I have had the haddock with mushy peas and chips (yum) and the cod fish cakes. Both were good. The fish was of \u00a0good quality, and not as oily as in most other fish and chips places i have been to in England. The place is usually very crowded (its really small) and so you can expect a 15 min wait at any point, though you can book for large groups. The staff is friendly and makes every effort to get you in quickly. Once i went alone and there was a guy behind me alone. So they asked whether we would be ok sitting at the same table. He refused.The golden hind also taught me a new virtue of not smoking. We were there in a group and the desserts arrived when half of us were out smoking. They had very little left for themselves by the time they returned :)P.S: It doesn't sell alcohol but allows you to bring your own.",

Based on the raving reviews, I was really expecting to be blown away, and everyone around us chomped down on their fish and mushy peas with a look of pure ecstasy on their face. Perhaps I'm just not a huge fan of fish and chips, but I found the food to be bland, though well-portioned, and no amount of ketchup, tartar sauce or lemon juice could make my taste buds sing with joy. The mushy peas were certainly more appealing than they looked, although I thought they just tasted like beans. However, I do like the BYOB concept and it's one of the better fish and chips I've had in London. I never thought I would utter this sentence, but the spotted dick was tasty!

    "text": "We ate here on what turned out to be a successfully foodie weekend. Didn't know anything about it and stumbled upon it closed, then thought it looked so old fashioned and traditional that we'd come back in the evening. That was a good move even though we were nearly scared off by the crowds and confusion outside. The chips and peas weren't fantastic, but the battered haddock was wonderful, light and fantastic quality. I lived in Yorkshire where we only ate haddock fried in beef dripping and don't normally like southern fish and chips, but this was great. I loved the old friers in the restaurant and the slightly down at heel feel, made it more authentic in my opinion. The prices were great for London - really good value.",

As a tourist, it was important to me to 'check the box' on eating at an authentic fish and chip restaurant since they are a dying breed. However, if you are from the US and have good fried fish near you (e.g. you're from the Gulf Coast) you might skip it and go for something you can't get at home.",

Now it's also packed on weekend evenings and kind of greasy + if you want great take-away fish for roughly the same price you may also go to the fishmonger further up Marylebone High Street. A nice place, but its real perk is that you can bring your own bottle, with no cork charge !",

We were completely underwhelmed by their fish and chips.We ordered the cod and the haddock just to compare (although our waitress told us they taste the same). They were flaky, but neither the cod nor the haddock had much flavor. The batter on the haddock was crispy but the batter on the cod was a bit soggy.Since trying fish and chips in London was on the top of my list, I have to say our experience here was disappointing.******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

    "text": "Fish & Chips are a staple for anyone in London seeking a good meal. Though their prices can be exorbitant given its touristy association, The Golden Hind manages to keep prices reasonable and deliver on its promise of delicious fried fish.We came here after dropping by another establishment for breakfast but left unsatisfied. While we were only the second party after it opened, the restaurant quickly filled with locals and tourists alike. Sounds like this spot may have been featured in a guidebook or two!We started off with their Fried Calamari which ended up being six rings with not much else to rave about. It was simple and good but would pass on the next time. However, moving onto the actual fish and chips, we each got our own critter and decided to split the chips. THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER.Our fish came out shortly after the appetizer and it was massive. For less than \u00a310, you've got yourself a giant plate of food. One order of chips was enough for the two of us so please be aware if you decide to order individually. If you can't decide what fish to order, definitely go for the cod. Despite it looking a bit smaller, it's superior in taste and juiciness than the haddock option. They were both crispy and satisfying.The Golden Hind was \u00a0a great experience. It did end up getting busy so service started lacking and we ended up paying at the front. However, for the price and quality, you can't go wrong with enjoying fish and chips here at their establishment.",

Staff at the register were kind and polite but wait stuff were lackluster and not personable. I would go back for the cod, no doubt!",

He said that The Golden Hind was the place to get the British staple so we, of course, obliged. The place is darling. A little tiny restaurant with white paint and dark brown two-top tables. It feels very nautical when you walk in, which is appropriate. They had the place decked out in mismatched Christmas lights, which was perfect. The menu is small, don't expect to see some kind of Bennigan's sized menu when you sit down. We decided to have the (duh) fish and chips - Bob had the skate and I had the cod and we ordered a side of mushy peas as well. The fish is fantastic. I am not a fan of deep fried food - but this batter was light, very crispy and wonderfully flavorful. Unlike in the US - you can still taste the fish through the batter. The mushy peas were probably one of the best things I have ever had. They had the consistency of mashed potatoes? But they tasted very buttery and pea-ish. The chips (aka: fries) were the only thing that I was not a big fan of. I am not particularly fond of steak fries, I prefer mine smaller and crispier so, I was biased from the start. The overall experience was wonderful though - service and food were top notch. Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on, because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy in London!",

It was crowded and noisy and hot but everything we ordered was so delicious we ended up either eating here or getting takeaway a half dozen times during our two-week visit. We love the fish cakes studded with black pepper and the lightly breaded plaice, haddock, and calamari, and neither the fish nor chips are greasy. Be sure to try the mushy peas! There's no bar but you can bring in beer or wine from one of the nearby shops. Golden Hind definitely is worth a trip from anywhere in the city.",

I read a review in my London Frommer's Travel Guide about The Golden Hind so we thought we would give it a try, and we weren't disappointed. The menu boasts a variety of different fish that one can choose...cod, hake, plaice, haddock. I chose the plaice as my fish,while my husband and daughter chose cod. Our fish was flaky and not greasy, with a good helping of chips and of course, mushy peas, that I have to confess, I didn't try...(I hate peas). My daughter and hubby liked the peas, but said they had a strange consistency, however, I actually thought they looked like mashed potatoes with a dash of neon green food coloring added for effect! Our meal was served quickly considering the amount of people in the tiny restaurant. The wait wasn't that bad either, but it is tight, with very little room to stand while you wait for a table. The place is a little run down, with wooden tables and chairs, old fixtures, and a retro serving buffet near the kitchen, but all in all, the food was good and the staff was friendly, especially the owner! Nice guy! It is BYOB, and that makes people sit just a little too long in a place where people are waiting outside just to get a table!",

Coming to London, i was excited and was expecting awesome fish n chips to be found everywhere, Be it newspaper wrapped or served on a fancy plate. Sadly, it seems that what London has to offer is quite elusive. I was told that to find a good one, it will have to be outside of London.That is until I heard of The Golden Hind which came recommended. That got me quite excited and I happily roped in some friends for dinner there.Watching food passing you with its aroma enticing was too much while we waited for a late party to arrive. We decided to order some starters to tide our tummies over.Feta cheese fritters \u00a33.4Whole tail scampi \u00a33.6Interesting fried little bites. I like the crispy batter and both were tasty without being greasy.Fish and chipsWith some of us trying to be healthy, there were mixed orders of grilled fish and fried fish in the fish and chips order.The fish and chips are decent and of a good standard.

    "text": "Really great pick for my first Yelp review, and our first restaurant stop in London! No muss, no fuss, bring your own wine/beer fish and chips place. Adorable Greek man that runs the house, with multiple fishes and preps to choose from, as well as simple, delicious sides. Try the mushy peas, for a visitor to London as we were, it was essential and delicious, as well as the Greek pickles - homemade and great as well. The fried fish was a huge filet and perfectly prepared. The chips were normal, not anything amazing, but good nonetheless. We were happy to have this within a short walk from our hotel - definitely would recommend if in the area!",

A quick glance at a map and I was able to correct my course and head down Marylebone Lane.I passed 70 Marylebone Lane and became puzzled at the absence of the chip shop I was hunting. But then I remembered that in London, street numbers do not necessarily correspond on both sides of the street (so 73 Marylebone Lane might be several blocks away from 70 Marylebone Lane on the opposite side of the street.)Haddock is definitely the way to do if you like big, flaky white fish. I enjoyed the cod and another type of fish as well but the haddock stole the show.Know this:-Mushy peas are a must.- The desserts are nothing to look at but delightful (warm custard anyone?)- Bring your own alcoholic beverages.",

Many local people were there and all they serve is fish and chips!You can choose Large cod or small cod, and also fried or steamed.We had fried of course because thats the typical way but thats nice that you can choose. I think small was enough for me, and large was enough for a guy. But anyways you get really full! I would go back again to this place if I had a chance.

    "text": "First I'll start with the good. The battered cod was of good quality. It would have been amazing if the batter had some flavor and it wasn't sitting in a puddle of oil on the plate. If the tartar sauce had flavor, it may have made up for the lackluster batter. The other place we had fish and chips had tartar sauce that tasted like nothing more than mayonnaise as well, so that may very well be the norm here. It was busy when we got there and we got the last available table, the place is so drab that you feel like the food must be amazing for it to be this crowded, which would have been fine if it were true. Our service was rude, and was not very helpful when we asked about portion sizes. He stuck his elbow in my face while opening our ginger beer and then shoved the can to me with the back of his hand. When he cleared my plate, he dropped trash he already had in his hand onto my plate before picking it up. I waited tables and tended bar for over a decade in the US where we survive on gratuity, so once again, I realize there is a cultural difference, but I would think people would be thrilled to wait on Americans if it means they will tip more than is the norm simply out of habit. The chips were cold, dry, and had no flavor whatsoever. The mushy peas while colorful, were lacking in the flavor department as well. I saw a lot of others going heavy on the salt shakers as well. For \u00a330 total we have had far better food here with tons of flavor. In the US that entire meal would have cost us about half of what we paid here including a 20%tip, and would have come from a low quality chain restaurant. I would probably put this at the bottom of the list of places we've eaten at while in London.",

If this is what it taste like then I can definitely live without it. You won't hear me saying \"You know what I'm craving? Some Fish and Chips\"Yes there were a lot of selections of fishes, the food was fresh, but like one of the other Yelpers said the place stink of old grease...if you have no idea what I'm talking about, sniff the gunk buildup on your stove's hood filter...multiply that by 10.One thing I've noticed about UK's fish and chips is that they are always one huge fillet of the fish. I'm used to them being about 1/3 smaller and 2-3 piece per plate, the reason I mention this is that my the middle of the meal the bottom batter/shell of the fish got all soggy.It was a good experience, it really was better than the other places I went to in Central London. But like all the food I had there, these people need to season their food, It's like trying to review eating construction paper and premium paper....it's still bland! Food is about taste as well as freshness, presentation, etc. but in the end it needs flavor...or is it flavour?",

They were kind enough to change my order to take out and charge me at take-out rate, which is slightly cheaper than the dine-in rate. They also gave me some of their self-made tartar sauce and some ketchup for my chips.Well, I couldn't eat the cod I had ordered for about an hour and fifteen minutes. I figured by the time I opened it up, the batter was going to be all soggy. But when I did open it, it was not soggy whatsoever. In fact, the only problem was that it was slightly colder (but that's to be expected). The fish was perfect, there's no way around it. The batter was excellent, but never outweighed the flavor of the fish. As well, the tartar sauce was probably the best I've ever had.The fact that I could eat my fish 75 minutes later without it being soggy truly indicates the Hind's quality.",

The cod was giant (about the size of half my arm) and fried to perfection. Though there's not much to complain about, there's also nothing too amazing about it. I guess I just realized from the meal that fried fish, is just fried fish to me.I wanted my fish n' chips experience in London, and I was definitely satisfied with the meal. However, nothing amazing to rave about. I guess a little more flavor in the batter would have been nice. Something like a little salt would have been nice.",

    "text": "My favorite go to fish and chips shop in London. It's ironic that this humble establishment, which serves what many would consider plebeian food, is located just down the street from the celebrated Wigmore Hall and the outstanding Wallace Collection--two of my old haunts in one of the swankiest parts of the city. I've tried quite a few around the city. I was even armed with a top rated list from numerous London food writers and tried them out one by one but gave up after a while for obvious reasons! Time and time again I ended up here because it's so good. The restaurant is plain in decor and unpretentious but with the friendliest service from the owner down to the waitstaff. I love the fried haddock with chips and mushy peas. Cod is my second preference. If you're in London and in the mood for the freshest fried fish this is it! However, don't be deterred by the line waiting to get in. It's totally worth the time and trouble.",

    "text": "The best fish and chips in London? Let me tell you what I think about this restaurant. I ordered large portion of fried cod version of their fish and chips. I'm not crazy about fried stuff, but when it comes to fish and chips, I just had to try it.I was really surprised by the variety of fish they served too. \u00a0You can choose fried or steamed haddock, cod fishcakes, dogfish, skate and halibut. \u00a0Most fish and chips restaurants in North America only have two varieties of fish such as cod or halibut.Initalliy, I wanted to like the cod because there wasn't a big thick layer of batter covering the fish. It was nicely seasoned, but the fish was most likely over fried so it was dry like overcooked French fries which came with my dish. The mushy peas which came with the dish was like eating green peas version of mashed potatoes. I like my fried cod to be a bit juicy with fish oils when sliced with a knife and it just didn't happen at The Golden Hind. Dry tasting fried fish doesn't do it for me.",

    "text": "Not bad fish & chips...minus the hair.The best fish & chips I ever had was from some chippy in Penzance, and I wanted to get some in London before heading home. Based on the Yelp reviews, that took me to The Golden Hind.It's a good walk north on Marylebone Lane from Bond St station. The place had a few customers, and the employees all seemed to be Russian. I ordered haddock & chips for takeaway, and that came to \u00a36. The food was in my hands perhaps 10 minutes later.Obviously it was a mistake to order takeaway. I knew that there was a square nearby, and I hoped to enjoy my meal on a bench there, but, as is remarkably often the case in London, the gate was locked. I walked several blocks and came across three more squares, only to find that they were all locked. Sure that, now 15 minutes later, my meal was going to soon be stone cold and the fish mush, I ate on the pedestal of some fountain.I was pleased to see that they provided malt vinegar in my bag, and it all smelled very good. But then I pulled away the oil-soaked paper to reveal a disgusting, wavy black hair on the edge of my tray, laying right next to my chips. Well, I was hungry and had walked quite far enough, so I bravely tossed it aside and dug in. Of course, had I been eating in, I surely would have complained. The fish was okay, although it needed salt. Sadly, the chips were rather mushy. Certainly nothing like what you can get in the southwest of England, but, if you do go, check for hair before walking out the door!",

The one in US is very thin, so this thick, big and long fish is perfect! Its not salty at all, so you may want to season it yourself if you like strong taste. The garlic butter shrimp is just so so. Met Tony the owner, vey nice gentleman. He said you have to have the perfect batter, good quality fish and good oil to make perfect fish n chips! An older lady said you gotta try this restaurant, its the best and ive eaten here for 30 years. Its super!",
