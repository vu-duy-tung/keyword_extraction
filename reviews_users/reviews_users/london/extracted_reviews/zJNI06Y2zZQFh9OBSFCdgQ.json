The sandwiches were different and the quail egg stood out with its slight mustard twang. The macaroons were faultless and the small delicate lemon \u00e9clairs just exploded in your mouth with so much flavour. I also went for a seasonal cocktail and it was probably one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. (Visit - 29/11/2014 Lunch)",

    "text": "This review only applies to the Parlour. Sketch is one of those places that would almost be most enjoyed if no one had ever told you about the details of it's decorations and you stumble upon it yourself. Although this restaurant has apparently been a London classic for nearly 10 years, I first learned of this restaurant after making a reservation for Pierre Gagnaire's original restaurant in Paris. When I asked around, everyone in London described that it's decoration alone is worth a visit, especially the loos. I jumped on this chance when I had friends in town who wanted to meet for breakfast (reservations taken before noon at the Parlour). \u00a0The Parlour is probably the most tamed/classic of all the rooms. It is a tea room and stays true to that. A walk through the other rooms and the design element didn't disappoint. I'd say imaginative, arty, and eclectic (part Sandusky hotel, part vintage). I wish no one had told me about the loos and left me to discover it myself, so I'll leave out details here. A few other patrons were having afternoon tea and it looked decent. We ordered lunch (burger, tartare and salads) and it was OK. 4 stars for the decor (even with the hype) and 3 stars for the Parlour food. Tea selection was good. \u00a0I think you take Sketch for what it is. Perfect for bringing guests looking for a surprise element but I wouldn't go for those looking for a classic Chez Gagnaire food experience. In fact, I don't even think I'd recommend it if guests were looking for one single London must-try.",

It's not necessarily exceptional (although some members of my party had tea and scones and I was thoroughly jealous). The prices were consistent with other restaurants in Central London. I must reiterate--check out the bathrooms. They were so much fun. The different dining rooms also added a kick of fun to what was an otherwise cold and dreary English day. The cappuccinos were strong--excellent for a mid-day boost after a tiring morning flight. The toast with butter came with a good selection of spreads.",

We sat in the room in the front of the restaurant that was a mixture of strange items and art pieces. As far as I could tell, there are two more rooms in the restaurant. One looked like a forest. The last one was bright pink. The restrooms are an experience too!As far as food, that is why the restaurant gets one star off. It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't great. We started off with a tomato soup and bread brought in a Lego basket. Then, I had both the pate and foie gras burger. Both were fine, but not exceptional. The presentation on both was phenomenal. We had dessert as well which was unremarkable. Overall, just because this restaurant provides such a trippy experience, it's worth going to.",

So you're looking at around \u00a378 for two people. That's about the price of an afternoon tea at any of the nice hotels in the area - so if you're feeling a bit adventurous or forgot to adhere to the dress code, this is the place to go!There is a great selection of \u00a0teas: I got the white tea, and it was the right bit of flavor - and didn't get too concentrated as the water ran low. The assortment of desserts and sandwiches was unique, my favorite dessert being the strawberry cheesecake and my favorite sandwich being the asparagus sandwich. The scone was spot on. We sat in the parlor room, which had a very interesting chandelier and paintings that demand more than a passing glance. The servers were nice and attractive, though slightly slow. The highlight of the afternoon was the egg bathroom and its two French maids. I never thought I would say a bathroom would be the highlight of a dining experience. Definitely worth going back to when friends are in town.",

    "text": "Sketch is a splurge, no doubt about it. Be aware of the price point.I'm glad we booked up in the Lecture Room; when we got a tour of the rest of the premises, the other dining rooms were much louder, much more buzzy, and much less, well, classy. (Also, the pod bathrooms are cute, but they didn't smell or look particularly clean on a Saturday night; I'm glad that the Lecture Room had its own facilities, which were bling-tastic but impeccably clean.)When I visit a new place like this, I generally opt for the tasting menu to get a broad sweep of the chef's style. The food here is very much nouvelle Continental. You won't encounter anything particularly exotic or flamboyant, but you can generally depend on classic flavours done right.I felt that some of the menu items shone, like the venison, whilst others were a touch off base. A couple of the sauces were too bland, and the kamut (or spelt; I can't actually recall) was overly salty. Portions were small, as expected, but very slow to arrive; overall, we were there nearly five hours, including the 20-30min tour of the building, which is quite a long time for a seven-course meal.Service was mostly impeccable. One of the waiters was less than willing to make a substitution for one member of our party, which was a touch off, but the chef came up with a compromise. Likewise, the sommelier butted heads with me on a few of the wine choices, despite my explaining to him that I was choosing them to be in line with the more conservative palates at the table.Dessert was visually pretty but all components were overly sweet and not particularly refined. I would have liked to have seen a greater overarching story to the meal; instead, it felt like individual components cobbled together in only a roughly increasing degree of intensity rather than gastronomic cohesion.Enjoyable, and a good choice for a celebratory dinner, but I can't say that any of the dishes were memorable enough to make me rush back.",

    "text": "I went to the Gallery with a friend for dinner last week. Overall, my experience at Sketch was memorable, but I still wouldn't say it was worth the price tag, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. One thing I must say is the service was top-notch. The staff was attentive and very helpful in their recommendations. They seemed to be genuinely interested in making our dining experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible. The ambiance is absolutely lovely. The pictures don't really do it justice. It is truly a Gallery as the name would suggest - very colorful and beautiful without seeming over-stylized and tacky. Also, check out the bathrooms! One of the coolest bathrooms I have ever been in in my life.Overall, the food was pretty good, not mind-blowing. My friend and I each got a cocktail, a starter, a main, and a dessert. The dishes were inventive on paper, but didn't seem all that different from what you could get at a number of restaurants in London for a much better price tag. Given that the hype and the ambiance was so unique and fresh, I was expecting the food to exhibit the same qualities. This wasn't the case and I paid a premium for it. I would say if you're looking for a great scene with decent food and don't mind the price tag, try Sketch out. I may come back, but it will likely be only for drinks or their afternoon tea. Again, I may have ordered badly, so I'm not ruling this one out entirely. :)",

Be prepared to reenact a scene from the film Cocoon when venturing to the bathrooms. (Anyone growing up in the 80s + visited sketch has done that, right!?) Now on to more important things (just), we visited Sketch for afternoon tea recently. The room is extremely quirky and the 'sketches' on the wall had my 5 year old inner self in stitches. The waiting staff were on the boarder of being rude, nobody was exuding a fluffy pink mood to match the room sadly (I would have happily paid extra if the waitresses were dressed in a pink care bear outfit - imagine that!). The food was good - egg sandwiches are always a winner and nice to have vegetarian options for afternoon tea. Tea was out of a tea bag, not PG tips mind but still out of a bag. I would expect tea leaves for the money you pay and destination. Rose champagne was \u00a317.50 a glass so make sure you start saving up those golden nuggets! I went with my mum and would definitely visit again with friends. More of a girls club than with partners.",

Although the sandwiches and cakes etc are small there is plenty of them and you wont leave hungry, you also have unlimited refills. With regards to the tea, I don't actually drink it. but I was there as part of a girls day out and my 3 other friends said it was ok, nothing amazing but I did notice a lot of different flavors to choose from though.The reason I'm giving it just 2 stars is because of the excessive cost.Our cost was \u00a368 pp, typically it is \u00a345 pp but it was higher than normal because it was Wimbledon week. We were aware of the cost at booking and decided to go ahead as there was a different package on offer reflecting Wimbledon. These \"extras\" was the bathroom attendant was dressed as a ball girl and there was a live feed from the tennis matches coming thru the speakers in said bathrooms......that was it. We each paid \u00a323 EXTRA for that.The real humdinger was when we got our bill an additional \u00a312 pp was already included in our total as a discretionary tip! As I said it is a really nice place, decor, food, staff - no complaints. If we had received something extra reflecting the extra cost incurred I'd be really happy. For now it just feels like a rip off.",

I must be very boring, as the sandwiches and cakes didn't leave me wanting more probably because of their unique combinations.

The toilets are jaw dropping to look at and each 'cubicle' is in the shape of an egg (bit claustrophobic though).The staff were friendly and showed us to our table when we arrived.

The place was decorated in a very unique and oddly cute way. There were multiple rooms but we dined in the pink one. All the dishes and flat ware were equally adorable. We had afternoon tea which was about 59\u00a3 each (minus alcohol). The food was excellent. We didn't know that we could get free refills on sandwiches, pastries or teas, which was a bummer. The tea selection was amazing. We had the mint and the red dragon, both excellent. Although it is a bit pricey, I would recommend and go here again. Experience and food are an A+ in my book! Also, the restroom are super adorable and again, oddly cute. Definitely an experience you'll need to try if you're in London !",

We had to ask multiple times for more water, more tea, etc. and were never offered it, but always had to ask. Finally, the last \"course\" of the tea was a slice of cake, which our waitress first asked if we would like to split one piece -- a strange thing to ask when we are paying so much for the afternoon. Finally, it felt as though we were rushed out of the table. Again, afternoon tea is meant to be drawn out and to not feel rushed in the slightest, but before we were even done with our cake, without asking if we would like anymore tea or anything else, the check was brought. \u00a0We didn't feel as though we ourselves were eating or drinking quickly, and we actually tried to take our time, but they had us in and out in under two hours. At the end of the day, the value was poor and the service not up to the standard one would expect. I would not recommend.",

The servers were very attentive (always ready to refill your tea or bring more food) and friendly. There were so many delicious sandwiches and desserts and teas to choose from!

    "text": "My wife and I were visiting London this week and were advised by a friend that we had to have afternoon tea at Sketch. We made a reservation a few days in advance and were not disappointed when we arrived. We were shown to our seats in the basement gallery room and offered a drink, I enjoyed a Matcha Bellini and it was a wonderful way to start the sketch experience! \u00a0Our first food offering was a small plate with slices of toast, a small serving of caviar and a ceramic egg with some kind of yummy cheese, my wife did not want the caviar and instead was offered a veggie version. \u00a0Next we were brought a 3 tiered tray of yummies, one tier of lovely finger sandwiches and 2 tiers of sweets, they were all quite delicious! They give you the option to order extra helpings of the food but be careful because there is plenty more to come! Next we were offered a choice of scones, with or without raisons, these were accompanied with wonderful clotted cream and 3 choices of jam. After the scones were were offered Victorian Sponge cake and Banana Toffee cake, the sponge cake was the winner as far as I was concerned. \u00a0 \u00a0We enjoyed 4 or 5 pots of different tea and they were all very nice. Overall it was a wonderful experience, the ambiance was very nice, the servers were very friendly and helpful. As wonderful as it was I would say it was a bit of a novelty, something that would be nice to do once a year or so. Be prepared to pay for the experience, this was not an inexpensive meal but to do it every once in a while it is well worth it. After a few pots of tea you will of course have to visit the toilet which are quite memorable at Sketch, they look like giant eggs or pods, I called them Disco Poo Pods for obvious reason, well obvious to me anyway. All I can say is that Mork from Ork would feel at home sitting on one of the poo pod thrones!",

The environment is just delightful - pictures cannot capture how beautiful and weird the dining rooms, bars and bathrooms are. Worth your while to check out in London. I came here for dinner (unfortunately missed the uber Instagram-friendly high tea) and had a lovely time. We had a delicious drink at the bar before moving into the pink dining room, and the service was absolutely fantastic - the bartenders were friendly, accommodating and knowledgable. Dinner was also very nice, though the service was not quite as on point as at the bar (likely because they were very busy). The food is good - not mind blowing - but fun and quirky, like the ambiance. My favourite was the Tchouki dessert, which was fluffy, lemony, marshmallowy, bubble gummy, ice creamy... super hard to describe, but totally one of a kind.",

We were in the cocktail bar. the bar itself was lowered into the floor and the staff had table service. its \u00a313.50 - \u00a315 per cocktail, we stayed for two, they were quite nice. iTs a bit cooky and weird - the toilets are little pods with weird people talking in them - sounds like air traffic control. Now what struck me as particularly bizarre was the fact that if you have a massive section for pod toilets where you can look over to the mens side \u00a0- why bother have mens/women. I was guided to the ladies side by a bizarrely dressed staff member (in a French maids outfit) who looked miserable as she was leaning on a pod. I'd go again - its bizaare but fun.The restaurant seemed to be a place where it booked up in advance, but not the bar. It is certainly a pricey place.",

But geez, the ambiance here is unlike anything I've ever seen.Unique, futuristic, artsy. Each room has a different theme and it's like you step into the wonderland that is Sketch right from the moment you walk through the front door. I made reservations weeks in advance for a Thursday night in The Gallery. We had a bit of time to wander around the venue before being seated so we walked through The Gallery and into the back bar/bathrooms. One word: WOW. Questions like \"Was this the future?\" and \"I am on a spaceship?\" crossed my mind. Really, really, cool. And you get to handle your #1's or #2's in your own personal egg-shaped pod. Nothing beats that. By far, the coolest bathroom I've ever seen.The food was okay. Nothing to brag about. You'll surely leave hungry unless you want to order multiple dishes. My friend and I split the Sea Bass Tartare, which was nice, but had a very light flavor. My friend ordered the Beef & Foie Gras Burger (21.0), which came with a side of fries. It wasn't a very big burger and we ended up splitting it. Juicy, tender, with a very light layer of foie gras. I ordered the Gambas (26.0), and I wish I got something else because it literally came with 3 prawns. Yup. That's right... THREE. 26 Pounds. BOOM. But seriously, such a stunning venue. A MUST DO AT LEAST ONCE!",

The bathrooms look like something out of 2001 Space Odyssey meets Clockwork Orange, meets Eyes Wides Shut (french maids and velvet curtains), with the aesthetic eye of Wes Anderson. There is a nice balance of hard and soft elements, naughty and nice, festive and dim, elegant and dangerous. The service was spectacular, the food was also elegant, delectable, perfectly presented. The ambiance was inviting. The decor perfectly picked out. Overall, there was great attention to detail. From the design of the menus, to the lighting, the color of the booths, the bathrooms! YES the bathrooms....Afternoon Tea at Sketch is not complete unless you include indulging in the trippy pod-bathrooms. Sketch is unlike any other place I've ever been to. There was beautiful live music that showcased both classical and current songs on cellos and violins. The food featured cakes, warm scones, caviar, finger sandwiches (that were made vegetarian upon request). They had many types of teas and you could try them all if you so wished. The servers were highly knowledgable about all of their dishes and made the act of serving tables an art, rather than a job.The overall price per person was not cheap, but considering the service, the quality of the food, the abundance of dishes, the creative ambiance, and the wonderful afternoon, the price is well worth it!I recommend making reservations ahead of time. We were unable to make one and got lucky with a last minute cancellation. I will most definitely be coming back to Sketch, and I hope to bring everyone I know there. I lived in London for 9 years in my childhood, and had never heard of such a place, revisiting London after 20+ years, Sketch will now become a permanent London memory and must-do experience.",

I ordered the afternoon tea option that included the infused tea champagne (\u00a379) and he had the Exotic tea (\u00a378.) The glass of Earl Grey-infused champagne was really good, but sadly no refills -- though the tea and main course offerings are endless.We're served a creamy (comte?) cheese with petite breadsticks to start. The cute dishes have words and phrases on them. I'm taking in the infamous pink room and began to see a pattern of funny characters, from the interesting wall drawings to the rest of the staff themselves. I'm feeling all 'Twin Peaks.' There's this guy, see. Dressed in a ridiculous pink full tweed suit. He's their caviar mascot, it seems, handing you a scoop of their caviar for your plate before happily twirling off. Dr. Jacoby. Yes; he's like a young Dr. Jacoby. Next comes a guy that reminds me of the Giant from Twin Peaks, who would sometimes serve as well. We couldn't understand a thing he said, and you know: I felt like he knew it lol I know the gals next to us couldn't understand him. I'd like to think he was telling us clues 'the owls are not what they seem.' Later, I notice a patron across from me has his head unfortunately placed next to one of the drawings, and I can't help but get a picture of him. And then the main courses arrive! Curry chicken, cucumber, smoked salmon sandwiches at the base of the tiers. Above that, the Battenberg cake, chocolate caramel cake, pistachio Petit Choux, and at the tippy top, homemade marshmallows and rhubarb cheesecakes. It was good; I tasted all the desserts not finishing them. I'll say that I enjoyed the sandwiches more (the curry chicken was my favorite) so I ordered more of them.Next course are the scones, with clotted cream and jam (his favorite thing always.) And last is my favorite dessert, the Victorian Sponge cake. There's a two-hour time limit to afternoon tea noted when you make your reservations, which I recommend doing as far in advance as possible. A notable thing to mention is that my husband loves tea. The variety is excellent here, and he ordered a few pots over the course of the meal. Two of the pots he had are from tea bricks (pu'er tea) and are normally \u00a325 each serving there, but you can have it during afternoon tea. I felt it tasted like dust and prefer the pu'er we have at home.One last thing: I couldn't not talk about the RESTROOMS. It really capped off the experience of Sketch. Through the room's pink door, up the pristine white stairs (a bar is in middle of the floor) you'll find the restroom pods. Men's = left staircase; Women's = right staircase. The pods are placed in no particular order, and sinks are found along the walls -- hiding behind pods. I felt like I was in Labyrinth for a moment, expecting Jared to come around the corner any moment as I searched for a sink. Everybody was taking pictures, which is kinda funny if you think about it.You have to come; just to say that you did!",

And my answer is YES, Absolutely! I loved this place the second I arrived. It's very girly, modern and artsy. Each room has its very own energy and atmosphere. We sat at the pink gallery for dinner. With started with some fresh bread and butter (the bread was not the best, but i'm french si I have very high expectations haha). Then I had the lamb and it was VERY good! We didn't have anything to drink (besides water of course) but the drinks section looks pretty good. And of course, I highly recommend going to the bathrooms for a little surprise ;)! One more thing: their plates, bowls etc are all very fun with quotes in/on it",

From the entrance, the main pink tea room, to the pod bathrooms- you'll be taking pictures of something- guaranteed!!!A bit on the pricier side, but you will get your money's worth.Had the standard afternoon tea. The waitress helped me with the tea selection, which was nice. To start, they give you a piece of bread, caviar and egg. Pretty interesting combo, but good nonetheless. The sandwich selections are nice- not your traditional cucumber and mayonnaise sandwiches. And then the sweets- omg so pretty and yummy!! I was so full I couldn't even touch the top pudding and marshmallow. Don't forget the cake and scone. I will say, I wish the scone was a bit better, it was on the dryer side, but the jam and clotted cream made it.And not to mention the live music performance by a mini orchestra.Make sure to plan ahead with reservations!",

This place books up quickly so I suggest getting an online reservation as soon as they open up the dates which are usually a month out.There is a set menu starting with caviar and champagne (if you choose for additional cost) then moving onto assorted finger sandwiches and pastries served with your choice of tea. You will also receive fresh scones served with cream and jam. These were probably the best scones I have ever had! Lastly they bring you a slice of cake. It was A LOT of food. Make sure you go hungry and give yourself after you finish before your next meal.",

Wine list is extensive but to the point. Very happy with the Malbec we chose. I had the lobster bisque, can only describe it as rich yet sublime with a superb (live) presentation. Rack of lamb was a perfect dish as a whole, all flavors and texture were complimentary to each other. For dessert, I had the panna cotta, which was good but not what I expected in terms of consistency and flavor profile . You would like it if you enjoy sugary sweets -think bubblegum and cotton candy. I highly recommend any of the Sketch establishments, all are a treat in quality.",

    "text": "My friends and I were on a short vacation to London and made sure to add this to our itinerary after doing some research. Overall, we're glad we got to experience Sketch- but will most likely not return. Decor: The restaurant captures your attention as soon as you walk in with hip and modern design. It'll make you want to immediately pull your phone out and start taking pictures. We had the Christmas Afternoon Tea which was held in a beautifully decorated and very pink/purple room. Service: We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. We were all so excited and were busy taking pictures until we realized that 15 minutes had passed by without anyone coming to our table. We finally flagged someone down and they briefly explained their menu. This was a constant struggle- the staff was running around but it was so hard to get consistent service. Maybe they do this on purpose since there is a 2 hour time limit, but we were so confused how such a high rated place could be so slow on service. We passed our two hour time limit and a manager came to tell us we had to leave soon. The funniest part is that we had been waiting for almost 30 minutes for someone to come to our table so we could get a check. However, the waiters and staff that did attend to us were friendly and helpful. Food: The most disappointing part was the food. The display of the food is pretty so you will definitely get an \"insta\" pic, but the taste was subpar. The chicken salad sandwich was our favorite, but even on the second round we weren't impressed. The bread of the sandwiches tasted stale as if they had been out for a long time. They sell the unlimited food idea, but it is so hard to get your money's worth. Toilets: It is odd to say the toilets were a highlight of a restaurant experience, but it was. Special Occasion: We were celebrating our friend's engagement so they did surprise us with a place that said congratulations with a candle. It was just a piece of dessert already on the afternoon tea menu, but the thought was very kind.",

I showed up randomly, so I wasn't aware that the pink room is strictly for afternoon tea or dinner sadly- (which is a splurge if you just want a glass of wine in that room) but you can still admire it. The green room was just as unique, with different drink options and great service. I enjoyed all the different costumes the staff had in each room as well.

We had dinner reservations in the Gallery and got seated right away. The hostesses are so kind and greeted us with a smile. Our waiter also took good care of us and recommended a few of his favorites. For appetizers we ordered the souffl\u00e9 and scallops. The souffl\u00e9 was excellent--very rich, but also refreshing. The scallops were OK. This was probably my least favorite thing we ordered. For our main course we decided with the bone barrow, steak tartare, and sea bass. We loved every single dish. They're all my favorite and I recommend trying all three of them. All I could say was WOW and my stomach was definitely happy! All of our dishes came out fairly quick too. The only downside to our experience, was that, it took forever for our dessert to come out, but they made it up by not charging us for the dessert! It also gets a bit noisy and overwhelming, but our experience was still enjoyable. The restrooms are by far the coolest restrooms I've ever been to! I was amazed by the unique concept. Overall, such a fun experience and the dishes were all memorable and melted in my mouth. I would definitely come back!",

Once people started coming in the service became non existent. Funny, because there are tons of servers. For the price you expect better service. I do not understand how service people can be so snooty. It is always better to treat people kindly, rather than act like you'd rather be elsewhere. It took us 20 minutes to try and get the bill and we were sitting right in front of the bar where ALL the servers walk by. We hailed someone down and she just forgot, even though we are right in front of her.The ambiance is different than the typical high tea. It's more modern and of course looking at the bathroom you can tell. The bathroom is co-ed - I say this because it does not have a wall to divide between male and female and you need to guess which side is which. Let me help you not guess. Follow the pink lights ladies and follow the blue light guys.The food was presented beautifully. Of course you will always have favorites but of the many choices we only really liked two items. The mixed drinks were delicious.",

    "text": "Sketch is an experience from start to finish. All the way down to the bathrooms, this is easily one of the most entertaining places to dine in London. Sketch was designed by a modern artist. Their are several different \"themed rooms\" you can dine in and like all of London, they operate heavily on reservations. I went for afternoon tea and sat in their most popular room...it's a \"whimsical gallery\" with a whole lot of pink. Their is no detail that goes unnoticed. The wall is covered in quirky art, the acoustics are perfect, pink and rose gold everywhere and the waitstaff dress like they're citizens from the hunger games universe. And I almost forgot...The Bathrooms. These are seriously from the future. Left is boys and right is girls but its' all the same room. You basically do your business in a space pod. Also, their are french maids hovering around cleaning up. Pretty immersive if you ask me.Okay, not to the dining. So it's expensive but you go for the whole experience. Afternoon Tea is 58\u00a3 a person. Most other fancy tea places were about 35\u00a3+ so it's really not that crazy of a price but know before you go.What you get: Unlimited tea, sandwiches and sweets. Go hungry but don't eat so much you ruin your day. I was very conscious of doing this since we had sites to see! All of the food is brought out on a beautiful desert tray. Personally, I liked the sandwiches more than the french inspired sweets. The sandwiches are amazing. And of course, the tea is great as well. If you're wanting to add a little extra you can pay a 20\u00a3 (ish) extra per person and get champagne added to the experience. They also have cocktails you can order a la carte. Overall one of the top three things I did on my recent trip across the pond.",

We went for brunch in the Glade room and it felt really whimsical and Alice-in-Wonderland-y. The couches were a little low but otherwise the room felt open and comfortable. I got the 9 Conduit St. black croque which was a croque monsieur on some sort of amazing black bread and the burrata and my boyfriend got the Black Pudding and Pork Belly. All of it was delicious and I thought the prices were reasonable -- but we were cognizant not to order drinks since cocktails were ~\u20ac20. I'd definitely come back to try the afternoon tea, though! Also, yes, the bathrooms are fun. Check them out and really, you can't take a bad photo in there.",

Dining in the Lecture room means you embark on a fascinating culinary journey with creative and original kitchen, innovative and refreshing cuisine that always surprises yet never feels artificial. Gagnaire and his team master the fine art of precisely painting complementary flavors and textures into brilliant culinary masterpieces. Furthermore, the dishes are extremely well presented with great eye for detail.Pair this with an exceptional and impeccable service and you have a winning combination for an extraordinary dining experience. You instantly feel welcomed by the team that visibly enjoy what they are doing and take great pride in offering an exceptional experience.I highly recommend the tasting menu with the wine pairings. \u00a0It is to die for.Of all the London (Michelin star) restaurants, this is without a doubt my absolute favorite. Having moved from London to New York, this is probably one of the place we miss the most. We are still looking for a place to fill the void!",

When I told the waiter, rather nicely to please tell the chef about the eggs, she just walked away. Also I agree with the reviews below, the whole charity on your bill without asking isn't cool.

The two highlights of this place are probably afternoon tea in the upstairs parlour and the lavatory experience (I won't spoil the surprise). The meals are okay, but nothing to cross town for and the service is pretty, but hit and miss. It's definitely not an oil painting, brimming with attention to detail.

Polite as they were, there was really no reason to turn away two obvious tourists looking for a late bite at their establishment. We even asked for nearby recommendations and the ladies looked like deer in headlights and were largely unable to converse with us in a meaningful way.

    "text": "Maybe Sketch is for you but it's not for me. To give you an idea if you might like Sketch, here are some of its most important characteristics: - The dining room is all pink! Everything is pink except for the art on the wall which is black and white- The bathroom is so weird, it gave me nightmares. It's an array of egg-shaped toilet pods that evokes the movie Aliens, except the monster hatching inside is your poo. Inside the egg pod, there are loud rainforest sound effects with a man counting down numbers which made me feel like the egg would hatch open if I didn't hurry. Not the most relaxing toilet experience \u00a0- Food and drinks are mostly tasty but all came out a bit unexpected. My BF had the filet mignon and it was good. For my main dish, I ordered chicken. Except the chicken was diced up in BBQ sauce with popcorn. Straight up microwave popcorn and literally popcorn chicken with BBQ sauce. You should probably avoid that one if you can.It's an eclectic place that's for sure!",

The tea selection isn't vast but still good -- for one, I got white tea, and it was unique and refreshing. The scones were good as well. If you go for champagne & tea set, you would get sandwiches, etc as well! Service was so-so. It started out very good, but then, they took forever to bring us water. It wasn't even busy either, so go figure why that was. Overall, I felt like the staff could have been warmer and friendlier.Finally, great posh but also hipster ambience. Would be good for any event!",

Every item tasted fresh and delicious. My favorite were the scones, these were the best I had ever tasted and I still dream and crave them. The small scone size allows for that perfect ratio of crunchy exterior with fluffy inside, paired with the clotted cream and strawberry jam, it was like heaven melting in my mouth. It isn't just for people who love sweets, my husband found the quail egg sandwich to be savory and divine. It was so tasty, he had 6 of them! You can also have a champagne pairing, and their sommelier is amazing. She offered excellent pairings and even allowed my husband to taste a variety of champagnes so he could choose one he liked.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Service: 5/5The staff is extremely attentive. 5 class service. Atmosphere: 5/5The Gallery is indeed very pink, and the drawings on the walls are a bit trippy. It adds to this weird \"Alice in Wonderland\" feel. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and fun. The toilets look like space pods. Value: 4/5At 38 GBP per person, it is on the expensive end. However, most afternoon teas are around 20 GBP and do not include any refills. At Sketch, you can get refills of anything you want as often as you like. When travelling with a hungry man, this was the best decision.",

Ambience was quaint, more than liked the presentation, was more than willing to pay the prices on the menu, but to say the food was lackluster is a severe understatement. Came here hungry enough. Ordered the fish and chips and beef and foie gras burger. Every item was so tasteless that even though hungry, combined with the texture, we just couldn't stomach the food and preferred to leave hungry. Can't comment on the cakes as we cancelled our order and just wanted to leave and grab some real food. As my BF said, \"I feel cheated.\" Kitchen needs a radical change. Until then, skip this place and just head to Pret A Manger, better use of your time and money.Note: they add a donation onto your check without your consent. It's for a good cause, but their policy is to not ask (I asked them) and to just append it to the bill amongst your food items which is a little strange in my personal experience.",

We wanted to visit sketch because we have been long-time Instagram fans and were super excited to partake in their afternoon tea. Since the reservation maximum was 6 people, we booked separately: one group of three, one group of four. I emailed sketch reservations with our reservation information to see if it was possible for us to be seated together. The Reservations Agent replied and provided the following response: \"In regards to your enquiry, the maximum table size we accommodate for reservations would be for 6 guests, so unfortunately we are unable to accept any larger groups. As we do not honor multiple table reservations for one party and do not accommodate reservations for more than 6 guests, I have cancelled one of the reservations under your name leaving one booking.\"We were left with one reservation for three people. The Agent did not ask whether I wanted to keep my booking, instead he cancelled it automatically. Very poor customer service. The proper way to handle this would have been to let me know we would not be able to be seated together, and then ask if I wanted to keep my reservation. So frustrating and unimpressive.",

I went to the restaurant on Feb 17, we got seated immediately, and the drink and the waitress were lovely. When we were presented with our bill, my friend immediately put in the card without looking at the bill. After all, we only had two drinks, what can be wrong. After she paid, I noticed that the restaurant charged us an extra \u00a31 for a charity that nobody told us about or even told us that it would be automatically added to the bill. Don't get me wrong, \u00a31 is not a lot of money, but I would like to be told if a restaurant wants to charge me for something that I did not in fact consent to. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she rudely sniped at me saying that I should have checked the bill before paying it. I find it to be mind-blowing that restaurants can just do that, which in my mind constitutes as stealing. Charity is a voluntarily thing, regardless of the amount of a donation, and not something to be forced on upon customers. I love the place, it's interior is stunning, drinks are great. But service and the restaurant policy is sometimes just shocking.",

I made a reservation the day-of on a Wednesday, and it was a very easy process online. The only risky part of making a reservation is that if you don't go, you'll be charged the full amount of the tea service per person included in the party. I can understand this, since the turnover time for afternoon tea can be pretty slow. The hype over the interior is not un-founded. Coming here is like walking onto the set of a Wes Anderson movie, and the fact that there are no windows really gives the effect that you've stepped down the rabbit hole into another world. There are differently decorated rooms (and a very interesting bathroom!), which will make for cute Instagram photos if that's what you've come here for. But me, I came here for the tea.Overall, the food was REALLY close to perfect. Everything was so tasty and fresh, and you can really tell that everything was made to order. I believe the price was 30 or 35 pounds per person, or somewhere around that range. It is completely worth it. You may order as many desserts, or sandwiches as your afternoon tea-loving heart wishes, and the waitresses do it speedily with a smile. You can also choose from a wide selection of delicious teas, which I expect nothing less from any place that serves afternoon tea, but nonetheless, the ones our party ordered did not disappoint. If you're coming to London, be sure to stop by, if just for looking around. I compare all the afternoon tea places I have experienced to my time at sketch, and I'm sorry to say it, but they all fall short.",

    "text": "Doing afternoon tea is a must in London, so I decided to check out Sketch with a few of my friends, especially after seeing it all over social media, & not to mention pretty decent reviews. This place is definitely on the pricey side for afternoon tea, but it's worth because of the unlimited tea and bites for two hours. I personally cannot eat a huge amount in one sitting so I don't know if I would pay extra for all you can eat again, but it is good value for money in general. You can also add champagne to the deal for an extra 10 gbp. Definitely suggest to make reservations online a few days before to secure a spot. The ambiance is to DIE for. There are a couple different rooms available for seating but we were placed in the big pink room which basically made all my little girl dreams come true. \u00a0That, along with the cute tea sets and the awesomely designed restroom pods all came together to create a really awesome experience. I am giving four stars because the selection of savory bites were a bit off for me and my friends which disrupted the experience a bit, but the delicious desserts made up for it. If you're looking for a classic and traditional afternoon tea experience, I wouldn't recommend sketch- but if you're looking for a hip, trendy place to hang then this is definitely the place.",

    "text": "The food was phenomenal and the tea was perfect (though I'm a novice when it comes to tea).First off, I walked in without a reservation around 3pm on Sunday and it was a 40min wait. I had also tried the Saturday evening and they weren't taking walk ins. I highly recommend calling to make reservations. You must also wait in the building but it was fine b/c there's a cocktail room you can sit and enjoy the decor while you wait.Once seated, I opted to order off the menu vs the pre-fixed afternoon tea (\u00a345 pp). I was so happy with the food - duck leg and beef roast - it was absolutely incredible. The tea was great as well - I ordered the jasmine. And, finished with chocolate and coffee cake.The entire place is charming and visually intriguing. You must see the pink room and use the bathroom. The staff was really friendly, BTW.I was dressed pretty casually with jeans and heals. I was comfortable though a lot of other patrons wore dresses. I'd wear whatever you'd feel comfortable in but dresses and hats wouldn't be out of the norm for tea.Overall, I highly recommend this place; food, service, and general interior design.",

    "text": "Booked our anniversary dinner here as it is renown as a special occasion type of place. We arrived right on time for our reservation and were shown to the first table in the Gallery - not the best location given the traffic from the main corridor but decent for people watching. Loved the playful decor juxtaposed with elegant dining furnishings. Service was prompt throughout food service - we had water and drink orders put in immediately. He had a glenfeddich neat and I the Chattahoochie mezcal cocktail which was absolutely divine and had me buzzing through the appetizers. He got the chantilly lace lobster bisque which he graciously shared with me since my \u00a324 scallop starter was underwhelming in comparison. His soup was heaven and something I would return for on its own - without a doubt it was creamy without the heaviness you might expect from so much butter. Again, the scallop scored high marks in presentation but was cold, underseasoned and lackluster. As it was the day to commemorate our wedding, we chose the duck to share. This was brought out in a cloche and unveiled for our inspection before being broken down. The plates were modest portions but delicately prepared with cranberry jus, and accompanied by a side dish of israeli couscous and other dark hare meat pieces. We ordered the napoleon dessert and waited nearly 10 mins before someone informed us it was no longer available; this ended up just fine as we were rushed to return to relieve the babysitter however it showed up on our bill. This had to be remedied and all in, we had to chase down someone to pay as this was extending long after we had finished our last course. As a result of this unceremonious ending, I docked a star for service and another for price points on some of the less than outstanding selections.",

    "text": "Definitely the highlight of my London dining experience. It was honestly such an amazing experience to have afternoon tea here. I'd encourage everyone to go at last once. My friend and I decided to do the simple afternoon tea (around 60 euros per person). Immediately upon being seated, you're given a great menu with many teas (I had THREE pots during my time there). After that a waiter comes up with an egg dish and grilled cheese cracker, and of course a spoon of caviar!! I was so shocked and felt like royalty. Of course then we got the platter itself. The food is unlimited but we honestly couldn't even finish what we were given. Everything was DELICIOUS. I especially enjoyed the chicken and salmon finger sandwiches and the scones. There's honestly so much food (and it keeps coming) that I left feeling stuffed. The ambience is also super cool! Everything is pink and there's some real cool artwork all over the walls. And be sure to visit the restroom, you'll be in for a (not so) surprise.HIGHLY recommend going - you'll leave super full and happy :)",

A phenomenal place to people-watch -- to feel like you're breaking the fourth wall in a contemporary rendition of an classic movie, reminiscent of Breakfast at Tiffany's. I was seated early; the staff was not fazed by the fact that I was dining alone (my brief trip to London was a solo endeavor). During the course of my dinner, I was approached by a myriad of waiters, sommeliers, and a gentleman who I took to be the the floor manager. Each member of the staff was courteous, respectful, and helpful. I had the homemade bread, the bone marrow, Sketch's velvety-smooth take on a classically intense penicillin, and for dessert--as per the manager's suggestion--a chocolate creation paired with a cappuccino. A masterpiece the whole way through. Thank you, Sketch, for a beautiful evening!",

    "text": "Four of us had dinner at Sketch a few weeks ago in London. We all had the tasting menu. Two of our party were very sick later that evening and the next day. The two people who were sick had nothing else to eat in common, and had only met that night, so it seems unlikely that anything else would have made them sick, other than the meal at Sketch. We emailed the restaurant to make them aware that two in our party were sick and appear to have had food poisoning. They referred us to an independent consultant. That consultant asked what else we had eaten and if we had been to a doctor. As we noted earlier, both people had eaten other things, but not together, so it is extremely unlikely that it was anything but Sketch that made them sick. We made this point to the consultant. And noted that neither person went to a doctor for treatment. Though one of the people sick is a pharmacist. So she could clearly take care of herself. The independent consultant determined their investigation was inconclusive. Which is a disappointment. A restaurant of Sketch's caliber and reputation should take responsibility for its actions. We have no problem paying for a good meal. And the food was good and experience nice. \u00a0Other than their getting sick. But we don't want to pay to get sick. I'm disappointing in how the Restaurant disclaimed any responsibility. They should at the least have offered to refund the meal.",

The food was mediocre; it's definitely more about ambiance. I ordered a relatively new item on the menu; it was a cereal cake with raspberry and soya milk. The most ridiculous thing to try to eat!

    "text": "Definitely a unique high tea experience to try at least once while in London. Before my trip, I booked a reservation a few weeks in advance for Saturday afternoon tea. I also did some research to confirm the correct room to book since there are several options on the website. The notable pink room is 'the Gallery'.For the classic afternoon tea, it doesn't seem like the food would be very filling, but you can request more of any of the tea sandwiches, cakes, parfaits etc. and the staff makes sure your tea cup or glass is full. My favorite bites of the high tea were the caviar accompanied with bread sticks to dip in an egg-shaped cup with yolk in Hollandaise sauce; the curry chicken sandwiches with colorful garnishes on top and the pistachio and hazelnut mini puffs. The tea pot, cups and sugar bowl are amusing to read with random words or phrases and the pictures in the menu are quite cute.After a filling meal, it is a must to visit the iconic egg-shaped bathroom stalls - just be sure to walk up the correct staircase since there isn't a clear divider between the mens' and womens' stalls.The service was quite slow, but very polite and courteous - a lot of the waitresses were speaking French too. What was also nice was that there was live music playing in the background from a female string trio. A little pricey experience since it is at least \u00a365 per person depending on which high tea option you select. Also as a heads up - they already add around 12% gratuity to the check prior to paying.",

We ordered the ravioli, lobster, and ribeye. The lobster came with an interesting pur\u00e9e that complemented the lobster very well. Other than that, everything else weren't too special, nor good. Afternoon tea here is probably more worth it, but probably won't be coming back for dinner here.",

    "text": "I understand that coming from Seattle, I'm largely a stranger to unique European experiences such as afternoon tea. But this dining experience was literally SO far below our expectations that it was baffling. We only had a few days in London and we searched all over months in advance to make reservations at spots that seemed worthwhile to us. We thought it would be fun to dine in an art gallery after visiting the Tate Modern, and in that regard we were right. The gallery atmosphere of sketch is absolutely mesmerizing, with not a single detail ignored. It features the witty and comical art of David Shrigley on the walls and within the dining fixtures themselves, brightly-colored pink chairs, and the famous toilet pods (which I'm convinced are a large reason for many of their visitors' 5-star reviews). The atmosphere is incredible and warranted at least 2 stars. But unfortunately the rest of our time at sketch fell flat. We did the champagne afternoon tea, which we didn't realize only came with a single glass of champagne. That's fine, but based on the dramatic price increase we didn't realize that. (Maybe because we are heathens who normally drink cheaper champagne, but nonetheless it didn't feel worth the additional \u00a334 or whatever it was.) The three tiers of savories and sweets for the tea *looked* absolutely beautiful, but there were only a couple of items that actually wowed us with their flavor while the others seemed like whimsical placeholders that tasted dull and unimpressive. Service was questionably slow and disjointed, which made no sense because we often saw wait staff just hanging around chatting with one another. We placed our tea order about an hour before we received it...long after our 3-tier snacks were consumed. This was frustrating. Flagging someone down was nearly impossible even though it was a Tuesday and the place was relatively empty. There was a live strings trio playing music that did NOT fit the vibe of the establishment at all. And that kind of helps to sum up our whole experience...I couldn't decide what vibe or what identity sketch was serving up to me, and I think somewhere with such a unique image should have a well-defined concept with background music that matches, service that is at least satisfactory, and food that blows you away. \u00a3300 later we were still hungry and largely unimpressed by the food and tea we had consumed. If you simply have money to blow I guess I can still recommend checking it out for the theatrics, but otherwise I would pick somewhere else.",

Perhaps I can give it another try when I return for dinner on my next visit, but my first experience was not a pleasant one. The staff was exceedingly pretentious and unhelpful when I politely asked for directions, to look at the menus, etc. I had a few drinks and some food with my traveling companion in the bar (which was BEAUTIFUL, and earns the stars I gave!). The service was terrible; in fact, we were too polite to say anything, but the French guests next to our table walked up and demanded that the waiters attend to us, as they noticed how we were being ignored amidst the other guests. It was super bizarre, as we always bend over backwards to be nice to waitstaff, and were excited to be there. It took 2 hours for one drink each as well as a few small foods (nuts, etc.). The only thing that will have me return to this place is for a meal in the main dining room; I hope the second chance eradicates the bitter taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "So the ambiance was nice. The bathroom is very cool. The service was excellent. However, the food was horrid. If you decide to go to Sketch, just know you are going for the decor/experience. Despite that, Sketch is still a restaurant so I would advise them to redo their menu. The chips that came with my fish tasted like they had been forgotten in the back of the freezer for the last decade. The couples on either side of my table were equally displeased. From my perspective Sketch is trying to offer too wide an array of food. They have British, French, and Italian items on their menu. I would suggest they simply pick one type of cuisine and stick with it. The waitress was lovely and I felt bad she had to endure the customers to my right berating her about how bad the food was. So, if you have 40\u00a3 to spend on a subpar meal than you should absolutely go to Sketch and get a picture of yourself with their fabulous decor!",

The whole room is note worthy, I spent the majority of my dinner looking at each drawing and laughing at the funny/sarcastic drawings and pointing them out to my friend. Also, the bathroom is a definite picture worthy place, I spent maybe 20 minutes taking pictures in the bathroom and I wasn't the only guest. The toilets are inside individual egg shaped domes, and the ceiling is covering in these multicolored light panels. If you love art, light pink, good food, and egg shaped toilets, Sketch is the place for you.",

Starting from their pink decorations & their artistic paintings they had on their walls, exactly where the famous Singer Tyler swift had one of her photoshoots for a magazine right behind the painting walls in the pink gallery. & of course their FAMOUS bathroom, that looks out of this world in which you MUST take tons of selfies in there! Their menu was very limited specially with the maincourse yet we got trufilled steaks along with some french fries & onion rings -which were unbelievably tasty- yet I didn't like my steak much & I don't know why, it tasted too meaty , other than that it was really good. & for the dessert we had La Rochelle, which was a very weird looking dessert tbh , it had what looked like 3 icecream cones , only that they weren't icecreams at all , they came in Lemon, Mango & berry flav along with some side marshmallow, so it wasn't that great even though it was highly recommended to us by the waiter. The duck sounded interesting yet overly pricely as it was 32\u00a3 i guess.  The waiter sounded a bit confused & clueless & i told her to bring me some cocktails instead of the diet coke I ordered, at the end she brought me both of them! & her food recommenations were not obviously the best.It was a pricey experience, as we paid 100\u00a3 +for the food & service, i was surprised to see that the olives alone costs 4\u00a3 & the bread & butter costs 4\u00a3 also -in which they recommend at the start- BUT it was all worth it! I fell in love with that place & I don't know why, You must visit the sketch at least once in your life! It would be an unforgettable experience, I guarantee you that! \u00a0Cheers!",

It seems like reservations shouldn't be hard to come by as long as you make them 24 hours in advance. Ironically enough, this place is French.Sketch was everything I expected after reading online reviews and their website. Swanky, futuristic, Sketch is an exciting blend of modern art piece and everything else from a cafe during the day to a dancing club at night. Or so I have heard. Instead of ordering an enormous three-course afternoon tea set, we both went for Cream Tea option. I had scones and White tea with hints of melon and cucumber. This is perfect for someone who's in the mood for a mild yet delighted Sketch experience. Check out the bathroom that look like a collection of giant eggs. The whole area seems to be taken straight out of a futuristic space ship where living specimen are frozen to come back at a later life. I might be taken a little bit away now... In short, I can't recommended Sketch enough. Bring a friend here as it's perfect for tourists and residents alike.",

The room I dined in was furnished with pink everything and clever art. Very well done.The service was adequate, though I often felt rushed, and several junior level staff members could use some polish.Most of the food was a bit bland, and with the exception of dessert, all dishes left something to be desired. All in all, wouldn't pay the ticket again for 'just OK' food and 'good enough' service.",

In fact, I'm always careful about all these trendy places where, sometimes, it's trendy, it could be nice but the food is not good. I wanted to try it, because I knew the restaurant was a two starred Michelin and was directed by Pierre Gagnaire.The place itself is so funny and full of surprise: all the rooms are totally different and funny. The main room for the afternoon tea is pink everywhere! We tried to find a name for that style but we didn't success! No loud music and the atmosphere is pretty calm.The service was great, even if we experienced one bad thing: our waitress was really nice, friendly and always wait to let me the time to translate for my parents who can't speak English. She took our order and a careful notice about my sister's allergy to mustard. But, the issue is, the kitchen staff made a mistake and some of the finger sandwiches contained mustard (fortunately, my sister just had one and it's not a too big allergy...) The waitress came to apologize as well as the manager and they did all their best to make our experience incredible (we almost forgot about this small thing :) )The food was PERFECT! Everything was good, delicious and amazing from the finger sandwiches to the different cakes served. It's expensive but, the food worth the price.I recommended this place for a nice, perfect but not too fancy afternoon tea experience!",

    "text": "It had been two years or so since I visited Sketch and once again it was completely different. This time with dusty pink interior, I got the feeling like I was stuck in the 1960's- all I needed now was big hair and a classic pin-up dress to match.Opening the menu, I was startled to see paper cutlery pop up, which was pretty cool! As a consumer, I felt like I was gaining an experience rather than just having dinner, I like that it has a museum feel rather that a restaurant.To begin, I had thinly sliced tuna with Avocado, which was absolutely divine! By now, you should know that I am in love with Sashimi! This was accompanied by a glass of white wine- Pinot to be precise, although I did move onto cocktails in the latter, which is always a bad idea. (Bouji Tip: Never mix cocktails and fish based dishes!) British designer David Shirley designed the plates and his artwork can be seen throughout the restaurant- classic, monochrome, but childlike which is a great conversation starter.For dessert, I chose Malabar, which has to be the best dessert that I have tried in a long while. I will definitely be back solely to have dessert and cocktails as this was just what my taste buds required; Lemon foam, bubble gum ice-cream, Panna cotta, Orange blossom and strawberry marshmallows. I felt like a little child again Oh and you must visit the toilets, which was the highlight of my night! Although that sounds rather weird, which it was, but the toilets are designed into alien egg spaceship capsules. Once inside, something strange happens, you can hear the sound of birds tweeting as you pee. How thoughtful of Sketch!I never noticed at the beginning but there is actually hopscotch on the floor at the entrance of Sketch. I don't know what possessed me but I actually attempted to hopscotch on the way out! Live a little. Carpe Diem!Price: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3",

Its expensive, but I basically paid to take a cute instagram in their pink room, aka the \"Gallery.\" \u00a0Its a place people go to take an instagram. The service was ill informed about the food, they did not explain anything to us for a 78 per person closed menu. I swear, every dessert was dry, bland or the wrong texture. The sandwiches were just not good, even their chicken salad sandwich had a massive lump of chicken fat. Also I had to pay 4.5 pounds for a bottle of still water BUT they fill your cup up a bit with it and take it back so its more like a third of the bottle, but you still pay.1 star for gorgeous decor .5 star for nice booking people when you call and .5 star violin music",

Our waitress and everyone who worked there were very nice and helpful. Once we stopped gawking at the cuteness of literally everything, we ordered our tea and champagne.

But I think the hype is well-deserved. You walk in and the hostesses at the front (who, by the way, are designated for that area) greet you and walk you to the next point after you give your name on the reservation (MAKE A RESERVATION). The next group of hostesses/host then lead you to your table in this giant pink, modern, artsy, chic room. There are giant pink couches and hilarious white/black prints all over the walls. You get seated and a new set of waiters come to take your order.It's obviously a set menu for high tea, but you can add champagne options (which we did). The food and tea are refillable - we definitely overdid it on the refills, but HEY, it's vacation. Where do I even begin? The sandwiches are delicious and the various different kinds are great for a diverse palette. The desserts are also not too sweet and everything just looks amazing to accompany the great tastes. When you're there, don't be ashamed of taking a million and one pictures of the food, the decor, and the people you're with. Take a selfie in the strange pod-rainbow bathroom - everyone else is doing it, too. Even if nobody else does it, you do you and you take that picture! I loved the attentive, friendly service and the entire experience. Missing it already!",

A chalk-drawn hopscotch at the entrance announces the restaurant's whimsy; you're not only here to eat, you're here to have an eye-gasm. Ascend the white staircase & feast your eyes on egg-shaped pods & colorful ceiling aka their co-ed bathrooms. One dining room -- a forest of teals & greens; another room -- pale pink & gold & ultra femme. Apart from the adornments, Sketch offers very little in the way of an exquisite dinner. His sirloin was tough & flavorless. This isn't the place for a quality steak. As for my cheese plate, there were interesting bits & bobs such as a creamy brie & an accompanying green apple gel, but nothing screamed unique or amazing -- sadly, a stark difference to how Sketch's surroundings made me feel. My advice to those curious & intrigued -- indulge in every online pic you can find of the restaurant, immerse yourself in the fun, artistic details...& then spend your pounds wisely by having dinner elsewhere. Entertaining decor impresses me, but a great meal impresses me much more.",

Went to one of the 3 bars/clubs for drinks. Sat immediately, they were super busy so drinks came a little slow but they were made well and all was good. We were sat for dinner on time. And that was about it for the rest of the night. Our server was not great. We ordered cocktails and they took 30 minutes. I saw them sitting in the counter for quite some time. But our server was nowhere in site. Someone else brought our drinks. 50 minutes into our visit our appetizers finally came. By this time we were perturbed, yet still no server. We ordered a bottle of wine. Sommelier poured for us most of the time. Still no server. I finally had to find someone and complain about the service. Our server checked on us once. Other people brought out our entrees. why have a server when 5 other people pretty much did her job. One person too many on the team that was completely useless if you ask me. This place was a disco, at best, that just so happened to sell decent food. Who was the Michelin critique who judged this place? Because I'd like to know how many drinks they had before having dinner and giving their rating. It's not worthy of the prestige that is awarded a Michelin Star. It was average at best including food and below average in service standards/time. Very disappointed, and even If i were 19-21 looking to go clubbing, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

Came here 2 years ago to what was the best tea experience in London, beyond the ambiance, the food was amazing (we got seconds of everything) and the tea selection was great. This time however we were left feeling scammed.They've changed the menu for the worse. The tea selection seems not as special, just your run of the mill teas you can find anywhere rather than the rare & exotic flavors from our first time. The desserts were inedible, the only one eaten was the blueberry cheesecake, otherwise they were all artificially sweet with ZERO texture to them. Even the macaroon, shabbily stuffed with runny icing was left untouched. Overall everything had either a bland or too sweet taste. Even the poor Victoria sponge was dry, it made me wonder if they've hired a kitchen full of first time chefs. I would suggest saving your money for a nicer (and undoubtably cheaper) experience at literally ANY other tea salon in London.",

She is an awesome friend). Chantilly lace was a bit weird. Beef tartare was quite good but it didn't really need so many things going on with it. Just the raw meat is fine. Slightly raw fondant potato was not so fine. Banana and lime macaroon was so incredibly good, I absolutely loved it. So basically they need a little more consistency and to let the flavours speak for themselves [disclaimer: I have no idea what I am talking about].Their website looks like it was made by a 15 year old internet nerd in 1997. Why do so many restaurant/bar websites make noises of some kind? So much inexplicable animation...The decor...I liked the tree made of toys. And the paintings made of forks and other random items. I can't work out if it's being wanky in a tacky way, or tacky in a wanky way. Either way, it was a pretty fun experience!",

    "text": "Been to Parlour once for drink and really liked the vibe, so I decided to take a friend there for her birthday to check out the mysterious and fancy library. I liked where I had my food, but I didn't enjoy what I had to eat. I was finally allowed behind the velvet rope and led upstairs to the library. I really liked the ambiance with beautiful high ceilings and one side of the dining room with floor to ceiling tainted mirrors. I also like the eclectic furniture style. We had the tasting menu which took almost 3 hours to finish and I wasn't satisfied in the end: - We had quite a strong beginning: a nice spread of tiny and delicate finger food of tart and jelly and cheese puffs. I was immediately full of anticipation of what's to come, only to find the experience to be going downhill. - First off, I had the sea bream and cuttlefish on black olive jelly. Obviously, the jelly was pre-made and put in the fridge and they just put the fish on top when someone orders it. It was quite blend. - Then came the red prawns which was actually quite good. - Foie Gras ravioli came after. I am a big fan of foie gras and I was not very pleased that they actually screw this one up. First off, putting foie gras in ravioli means it is not off the best quality, otherwise, you will never mess with it that way; secondly it was in a curry sauce which overpowered the nature taste of foie gras. I was not a happy camper. - Roasted pollock. It was a nice piece of roasted fish, and there was a bit of a surprise as escargot was used in the sauce. - Veal with sweetbreads wrapped in lettuce. They were served separately and I was wondering what the connection of these two flavors were. -Lastly, we were presented with 6 Pierre Gagnaire's desserts. They all looked very pretty, but there was one problem: except for one or two, they were not made onsite. While it was great to try different types of desserts, I'd rather have one very good one that is made to order. Don't get me wrong, those desserts were nice and I would be perfectly happy if I were in a nice cafe, but for a tasting menu, they didn't cut it for me. They charge 95 pounds for a 6 course tasting menu, but I have tried much tastier and more creative menus at a cheaper price elsewhere.",

    "text": "Came here for afternoon tea and given all the hype came away with the impression that this is exactly the sort of place that makes people hate London. The tea (\u00a339 a head) is in a room that is head-to-toe pink - it feels overwhelmingly like you're sitting in a blancmange prison. Everyone mentions the toilets, which are startling and apparently modelled on a Hollywood version of a celestial waiting room (or an Austin Powers set) with wall-to-wall white, individual egg shaped pods (mine didn't seem to quite seal itself, meaning I had to keep a paranoid grip on the door handle for fear of becoming a victim of latrinus interruptus) and the inexplicable inclusion of loo attendants in full French maid kit. The sandwiches are petite and with the exception of the salmon and caviar offering (whose caviar topping offers a welcome burst of intense flavour), sadly rather tame in the flavour department. The asparagus in the cucumber sandwich lacked any seasoning whatsoever, and the mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur was surprisingly greasy and tasteless.The scones and cream were probably the best thing about the whole meal - the scones are large and came to the table still warm, albeit with not quite enough clotted cream to go round. The fig jam was also delicious (and I say that as someone with a long time antipathy towards jam in general). The cake selection is disappointingly free of British flavours and the cakes themselves are horrifyingly small - the coffee eclair was about the size of my little finger (and I have relatively slim digits) and the raspberry meringue...let's just say I've seen bigger engagement rings. Call me a greedy beggar, but if you can eat it in one mouthful, it's not a cake, it's a petit fours, or in this case, a disappointment. Both the pistachio macaroon and the berry tartlet could have been quite delicious but (like so much else about Sketch) suffered from a wearying overkill with the addition of an unnecessary berry jam/compote in the middle. You do at least get free tea refills, but the staff dropped the ball by bringing my flowering tea out after it had infused, thereby denying me the visual pleasure of watching it bloom (which is pretty much the whole point of ordering a flowering tea).Overall, I might have been reasonably content with the food were it not for the disproportionate price tag which appears to be a function of the achingly pretentious interiors and service. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather have my food served up by polite, friendly professional wait staff without legions of wannabe models floating around purposelessly in utilitarian chic shirt dresses.",

It might be that we booked the last afternoon tea reservation of the day, but we only had 2 hours for our afternoon tea and I felt a bit rushed to consume everything. The servers were nice and told us we could stay as long as needed, but it felt a little awkward when the room started emptying and people started coming in for dinner.

Thoroughly recommended and a real highlight from my visit.",

They were in town for the Titanic 3D premiere I suppose. So now you have an extra endorsement from them to go to Sketch!",

    "text": "This is the most unusual Michelin starred restaurant I have visited in London so far. \u00a0It looks like a trendy nightclub at the entrance (I think there is a bar on the ground floor). \u00a0We were led past the velvet rope, up the stair case and went past a few heavy curtains to arrive at The Lecture Room where our table was waiting.Their surroundings are just what I want to see in this kind of restaurant. \u00a0Rich, colourful carpets and decorations flowing with luxury. \u00a0Comfy seats. \u00a0Dining here is an experience. The service was friendly and efficient, not stuffy. They made some jokes with us, which makes a nice difference. \u00a0We also got a mini menu to take home with us. \u00a0Another nice touch.We opted for the 7 course tasting menu. There was a vegetarian tasting menu and a la carte options available too.Breads. Served in a bowl, warm and crusty, but there was only one type of bread. There were two butters: citrus and a regular one. \u00a0The citrus one didn't quite sit right, it tasted like you were eating a lemon creme biscuit.Amuse bouches. \u00a0A mini macaron with blue cheese cream, a disc of goat cheese and a mini roll which tasted like melon. \u00a0There was also a little bowl of crunchy parmesan bites.Earth and sea 3. Great contrasts of flavours and textures. Looked like a raviolo, but it was a blanket of cuttlefish over the other ingredients (squid, pineapple and crunchy fennel). I liked the look of the mini lettuce filled with crab meat.Crayfish served with onion and turmeric jus. Came with spelt which gave the disk a nice texture. \u00a0The crayfish was obviously the hero of the dish and were tasty morsels.Pascaline. \u00a0I'm not sure what pascaline is (!) but this dish was firmly based around scallops, which I love. \u00a0We had fried scallops and fresh (raw) mushrooms on top of a scallop mousse and a mushroom sauce. \u00a0It tasted just as it sounds. I liked the scallop mousse the most.Hake, Savoy cabbage and razor clams. Nicely cooked fish and cabbage, I liked the clams. They were like prizes. The crumb coating on the fish tasted like lawn, which is not a bad thing.Jellied sardine, fois gras, celeriac, frozen raspberries. This was the most interesting looking dish of the night, with the huge cubes of jelly and the star-shaped dish. \u00a0Unfortunately, it was not entirely my cup of tea, but it had solid flavours. \u00a0It felt like a lot of sardine jelly to get through. \u00a0I would have preferred simply fried sardines, but I could see how this may have been too close in nature to the previous course.Hereford beef fillet, with turnip gratin and crispy aubergine. \u00a0The beef was cooked nicely, but for me the most interesting part was the cripsy vegetable chip on top.Pierre Gagnaire's Grand Dessert. \u00a0This was six desserts which came out on separate plates, 3 at a time. \u00a0They covered a wide range of tastes and textures, with my favourites being the chocolate ones.Petits fours. \u00a0There was a jelly, a mini tart and a chocolate. \u00a0Nice, but not too special.I had been looking forward to our visit here for weeks, but when the date arrived I had been sick for a couple of days and had a sore throat. \u00a0It was a shame because I wouldn't have got the full taste experience. \u00a0It was an expensive meal, but in line with my price expectations.",

    "text": "I'll be upfront, the stars are mostly for the decor and the bathrooms. I love a good bathroom design and these are some crazy ass wonderful ones.The food was surprisely good but way overpriced for the portions size and ingredients. You are paying for the decor and what decor it is. Over the top in all ways both good and bad. I came here for lunch so I can't rate the dinner service. The tea service was also going on while I was there and it looked quite nice if I on the dainty side. I would still like to try it as would I like to try the overpriced dinner service.I ate lunch in the parlour, it's probably the most boring room but still charming, there is the main dining room which was closed for lunch and the garden room which is very charming and of course the toilet which are egg-like free standing pod in a elevated white platform. I got the haddock souffle which was surprisingly good if very overpriced at 14 pounds but compared to the 46 pound dishes on the dinner menu, it's steal.The service was horrible even more so since they automatically add a \"discretionary\" 12 percent service fee which as a North American I would have a hard time asking a server to remove. But seriously the manager had to yell at the server to actually come over and take my order as well as the person next to me. I had to flag them down to get the bill and this was in a room with only four table occupied. It was my first time encountering a discretionary fee being added to the bill without my approval although it appears to be a horrible trend in service lacking London. Again if you are going to charge for service, you need to actually provide it. \u00a0So if you want to check out the decor without spending the big buck eat in the Parlour.The bathrooms are not in any way wheelchair accessible and the whole space is not designed for any kind of accessiblity.",

    "text": "9 Conduit Street in Mayfair, London.If you are into food, art, fashion design, or architecture, then you may be familiar with the address. The opulent townhome has served as the headquarters for the Royal Society of British Architects, the atelier of Christian Dior, and is currently home to the 2 star Michelin-rated French restaurant run by Executive Chef, Pierre Gagnaire.Even if French food isn't your cup of tea, if your pockets are deep enough, I suggest that you at least pay a visit to check out the unique ambiance. The d\u00e9cor is parallel to none; with each room in the space taking you on a journey that is evocative of trippy dream. There are three different dining rooms--each one offering a different menu and price point--as well as two ultra posh cocktail lounges. The whole venue is a riot of color and an onslaught to the senses. But the loud and quirky design makes this Michelin restaurant feel, dare I say, comfortable?!After studying all of the menus, I chose to dine at the Gallery, which is the more informal restaurant space with more reasonably priced menu items. British artist, Martin Creed, has transformed the space into a serviceable museum of modern art with eclectic chairs and one-of-a-kind dinnerware.To start, I ordered the Chestnut Velout\u00e9 with white truffle oil, and pan-fried squid saut\u00e9ed with garlic and cherry tomatoes (\u00a315). It was velvety, rich, and every bit delicious. I cleared the bottom of my bowl with the trio of freshly baked breads that were brought to the table (\u00a34).The second appetizer that I tried was the Dublin bay prawn tempura with haricot beans and aubergine, accompanied by an Osframpi sauce (\u00a325). The prawns were delicious but sadly, there were only three of them--typical French portions! I didn't expect the vegetables would also be deep fried, and I found them a bit bourgeois in contrast to the otherwise haute cuisine. The osframpi sauce was magical, however, due in part to the fact that I've never tasted one before. Essentially, it is a puree of wild berries balanced with some sort of lemon acidity to cut the sweetness. I did not use it for the prawns, but rather as a spread for the breadbasket.For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Cannon of lamb roasted en cr\u00e9pine, Ni\u00e7oise socca, swiss chard pomponette (\u00a328). The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sauce dressing the plate was to die for, but I have had better cuts of meat before. I cleared the plate none-the-less, which easy to do at a French restaurant--oftentimes in just two bites!There was little hesitation when it came to choosing a dessert; naturally, I opted for the chocolate one: Sketch Chocolat, which is a dark chocolate box filled with vanilla cream, nougatine, dried fruits, caramel syrup and coffee genoise. On the side, of the box was a little shooter filled with pistachio ice cream with pineapple and mango coulis (\u00a310). I also got the suggested after-dinner drink, The Whisk Away, made with Laphroaig Whisky and Kalua (\u00a37). The coffee notes in the dessert and cocktail complimented one another beautifully.All in all, Sketch is about the experience: the art, the atmosphere, the service, the exotic bathrooms! Sure, the food is very, very good, but it is the ambiance that is over-the-top. I would certainly return, possibly in some high heels next time, with slightly lower expectations of the food.",

    "text": "Yikes! It is expensive, but you get what you pay for!I was lucky enough to attend a dinner here last night hosted by business contacts. On entering the main hall the general bar is the the right on the grouns floor, a long, open room riotous with colours and quirky artwork. On meeting my group we went down stairs to the rear of the venue to the Glade room for drinks. This bar is a bit quieter and makes talking a lot more simple. Ceilings are equally as high, with reddish-pink walls decorated with crystals and sequins in swirling patterns. Odd squat 70's furniture reminded me a little of my grandad. Don't worry, you're not being targeted by snipers - the circular rotating mirrors in the walls seem to reflect red lasers for some reason. All part of the 'artistic license'. After drinks we moved into the main Gallery restaurant, much more to my liking. The whole space is white with projections beamed onto the upper half of each wall in an ever-changing display. All furniture is white, whether it's high tables with cocktail chairs, low sofas or glossy laminate tables. Just off the restaurant the VIP bar looks like a James Bond-esque snug - all black leather around a circular bar and curved walls. Up the curving staircase are the egg-shaped toilets that everyone raves about.( see pics uloaded). Yes - they're cool, but slightly unnerving to hear applause or Ave Maria sung by choirs on completion of your time 'en oeuf'. Apparently the sound effects differ per pod and the lights strobe through the full rainbow spectrum so you get a different experience at different visits.Now, on to the food. Luckily, with all the pomp and pretention, the food is still excellent. We tried the set menu ( which seemed to have some kind of apricot theme throughout! )I tried baked pollock on a bed of aubergine and a square of apricot jelly-esque side spread. This was followed by the rib-eye steak, done to perfection as a medium-rare, with vegetables and a polenta cake with some whipped, cocunut frothiness on the side. Finally a cake concoction stacked with diced apricots, apricot sauce and a brittle, nutty disc on top. All in all, a great food standard peppered with friendly and prompt service. I think that the main reason this place has stayed 'de rigeur' for more than 6 years is more down to this level of attentive and professional staff and high-quality food than to the 'quirky' or trendy styling.",

    "text": "I drank gallons of tea during my time in England and out of all the tea I had out at restaurants, this place had the best cream tea! I believe it was \u00a310.50 for the cream tea- the tea is endless, so we had a few pots \u00a0between the group I was with. The scones were fresh and the atmosphere is unlike any place you will go in London. I have never seen such unique/odd but cool different types of designs in one place. We came in around 3 pm on a Friday and had no issue getting seated. You have to go have a look around this place. Be sure to walk into the different rooms and to their main restaurant upstairs as well. I am sure this place gets pretty wild at night, as it seems like a bit of night life hot spot, but if you are looking for an affordable afternoon tea in a great area, stop by here!",

    "text": "In additon to my review below I have since had another visit to sketch for a friends birthday. We ate in the bar this time around and I can say without any hesitation that it was really, really poor. The food was trying to be art and flavour was an after thought. Out of 6 or 7 dishes we ordered 1 was ok and that was the peanuts. The sandwiches were black (by design), but all this managed to achieve was to to make it taste like a old sports shoe.. 2/10 for the bar, must try (less) harder! Back to basics... Have haunted the corridors of sketch on more than one occasion and always had a good time albeit expensive. Yes, put your nice clothes on, buff you shoes, clean your teeth, splash of the smelly stuff and hit the ATM hard and in style, ok now your ready for night. Pre dinner cocktails with well healed city girls and boys and then into the restaurant for dinner. Set in visual projected on surroundings the food is well presented, service efficent and wine list good but didnt find any gems. Great place for date, not a first! Great for group of friends who want good drinks, fun bar and good looking people.. A little bit shallow, well maybe a touch but theres a place for everything and Sketch fits theres perfectly. Toilets, well everyones else has said plenty about them but for my two cents, there clever and egg shaped, other than that there toilets and Ive seen better places to spend 5 minutes in several other London bars/ restaurants. Not sure about about one reviewers suggestion to \"forgetting about the credit crunch\" and hit sketch, theres a good possibilty you will still wake up in the morning with a very expensive hang over and not feeling any better about yourself.. But ive been wrong before... Worth a visit, but please no first dates unless your a city boy with little imagination and a large wallet, in which case, have a great time!",

Obviously, don't forget to check out the bathrooms (women are on the right and men are on the left, btw). We came here for afternoon tea and since we were here during the week of the royal wedding, it was a bit of a special edition. We opted for the champagne tea - note, everything (except the caviar and alcohol) are all-you-can-eat so don't be afraid to ask for more. Also, try as many teas as you can while you're there. All the food was fantastic, we were even served a small piece of the same royal wedding cake that Meghan and Harry had at their wedding just a few days prior! The service, however, was a little bit spotty. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come by our table after being initially seated. The waiter never came to check on us, only to serve us our different courses. He also forgot to bring the additional food that I had requested (I ended up being full by the end so gave up on asking for it). It ended up being about 250 pounds for 2 people (quite pricy IMO). The courses were spaced rather far apart and with that, and the waiter hardly ever coming by, we were there for about 3 hours in total (maybe 30-60 minutes longer than I would have liked). There's a couple other places for afternoon tea that I want to try, but I'm just hoping that we had a stroke of bad luck for our service and that wasn't the standard for this place.",

Why? Let me tell you why. It all started from walking through the streets of London, seeing all these name brand stores and finally getting to the cute artistic restaurant \"Sketch\". There were multiple rooms and through each room it was a different theme. All the waitresses and waiter has assigned uniform dresses and informed us that the theme of each room changes as well as their uniforms. Please do not get me started with the restroom, it was the most beautiful restroom I had ever seen, I went in there multiple times just to take more photos. It literally looked like walking into Heaven, which is funny cause it was a restroom. In the restaurant, there were 4 different rooms and each room had a different theme. The room we were in was more edgy, I was say. But, the room that caught my attention was definitely the pink room. The pink room was so cute, everything pink. The couches, the tables, and even the desserts! Not only was the place AMAZING, the people had such great service. If you ask me if i would go back, it would be an absolute YES!",

Visually, the interior (of the \"lecture room & library\", which is the 2 Michelin star restaurant) was surreal with interesting modern touches, while still having substance in the decor. The bars on the lower levels are not up to the same care of decoration. The food was an excellent, a multi-course tasting menu, which was in the modern French style. Some dishes were more experimental in their flavors (eg. saffron ice cream), but there was a cohesive substance within the recipes that made the majority of courses work. My favorites were the salmon and foie gras dishes. The food reminds me of Abac in Barcelona, but not quite executed with the same level of orchestration. It was very good; truly an exceptional experience.In addition, the service was very friendly and hospitable. At the end of the meal, I was given a miniature menu, which included a long list of ingredients used for each course. This was a very nice touch! I highly recommend trying Sketch for dinner.",

    "text": "Afternoon Tea Review:Afternoon Tea at Sketch is certainly an experience. It's an incredibly fun, yet super relaxing way to spend a few hours. My husband and I laughed at the artwork on and off the whole time. It was great to sit in a room that had on and off live music (string trio).The food -- I will say that I was very happy that once our waiter knew I was pregnant, Sketch made adjustments to all of the food items that can be risky to consume (caviar, undercooked egg, smoked salmon, and pate). I didn't ask them to do this; but when they came out with the food they clearly explained the substitute sandwiches and even put cauliflower rice balls on a spoon so I could pretend to eat caviar. Cauliflower is not caviar, but it was a kind gesture! I'm not sure how much you can escalate tea sandwiches, but this level of the 3-tiered serving platter was the most enjoyable for me. The presentation was perfect, yet nothing really blew my mind. I liked that you could get more of the sandwiches that you liked best. The deserts were fabulous -- even if I found some of them too rich/sweet for my taste buds. I should have saved more room for the scones. If you have a sweet tooth, this is a MUST experience. Yes, the bathroom was insane. I will say that I got completely nauseous walking in there after being in the pink room for almost an hour -- the sudden change in lighting and the mirrors over the sinks made me feel incredibly dizzy. It wasn't just me and my pregnancy -- my husband felt the same way. Just a warning!",

I made a reservation during the Mayfair Flower Show, and the exterior along with the characters of the staff gave it a Alice in Wonderland feel. The afternoon tea was 80 GBP, and with the additional glass of champagne, the whole thing came out to 120 GBP per person, which is a bit crazy to be honest, but I figured this is probably going to be my first and last time here. The service was good, and the staff were in character. The afternoon tea was quite standard, but with the added caviar for starter. The toilets was another thing, it was very unexpected. Firstly you can't tell which side is for men and which side is for women when you enter. The toilets are in this egg shaped containers that has jungle music playing inside. It is the strangest experience, and I can't say I enjoyed it. Frankly, I think this place is only good for the instagram pictures, so if you want to pay an arm and a leg for a good gram, this is the place to go!",

The butter was too hard to spread the other fruit jams were okay. + 4th Course: Cakes from the Trolley. They had a chocolate shortbread cookie that I enjoyed. Overall, I wished that had include more variety in their flavors. It seems like there were two different dessert tiers - the other one looked better, to me. They should inform their customers of other options if they do. You have the option of trying as many teas as you like, but as a results the teas are less potent than I would like. SERVICE: Service was alright, not very attentive. As it does take awhile to flag someone down once it gets really busy. But everyone was really polite and friendly. AMBIANCE: Very princess and girly like theme. Everything is pink and white. But the highlight of this location is actually their restroom. The bathroom \"stalls\" are actually individuals pods with spring scent and sounds. The bathroom is spotless since there is a cleaning lady there the whole time cleaning after your ever move. haha. It's not very obvious, but the bathroom is separate by male and females. The blue light leading up to the left side is for males and the pink lights on the right is for the females.",

    "text": "Interesting place. \u00a0Seems so unassuming when you first approach it and then you enter in and it's a whole other world in there! \u00a0I almost don't want to spoil it for people, but there are several options for rooms to lounge in. \u00a0I was in a room at the back left which was themed like a forest as though I was going hunting or something. \u00a0The place is really big.I came for drinks one night while in London and certainly didn't expect this. \u00a0They have coat check, and then you're pretty much free to wander around. \u00a0I have no idea what is up the one staircase as I didn't go there, but when first coming in, there's another room to the right that is a really great lounging area. \u00a0They had a DJ so it was a bit loud in there so we headed to the back. \u00a0Across from the room we were in was a room that looked like a pink 1950's American diner. \u00a0Past the doors through that room on the other side was the most unique bathroom I've ever seen. \u00a0I won't describe it, just go see it for yourself.Fun place to get drinks. \u00a0Maybe I'll try the food on my next visit.",

    "text": "If you're looking for afternoon tea, I'd probably look elsewhere, we had a \"Sketchy\" experience.I was really excited to eat at Sketch. The decor was hip, modern, and cool! \u00a0The bathroom alone made the trip to the restaurant one to remember, but just being a \"cool\" place doesn't excuse numerous transgressions. I waited forty-five (45) minutes just to have a couple extra finger sandwiches delivered. I could have walked to Fortnum & Mason, bought some of their sandwiches, and walked back in the time it took me to get finger sandwiches from Sketch. No less than four times did we ask our server for them and each time both of them said, \"We're sorry, they are on the way.\" \u00a0When I bit into the pistachio cake, the first bite was great! \u00a0The second bite was a painful like biting on a pebble because they failed to remove a cherry seed! \u00a0Yes, I bit down on cherry seed. Have you ever bitten something hard and not expected it? \u00a0Perhaps an olive seed, or maybe a fish bone in your trout? \u00a0At least with olives and fish, I tread carefully. I didn't tread so carefully because I was eating cake. I received an apology from the restaurant and they said it's never happened before. Thanks. I guess that makes my jaw feel better. \u00a0They had an opportunity to provide some extra customer service and fail short. \u00a0The variety of finger foods was mediocre. The food looked great, but the taste wasn't on par with what I'd expect. Even my lunch companion didn't care for several of the selections. \u00a0The visual appeal was there, but the taste fell flat. It was like taking home a girl you'd think was an absolute \"ten\" from the club at night, and then waking up with a \"four!\"I have no problem helping charities, but they automatically added \u00a31 to my bill to their charity of choice. Why don't you have the balls to ask me if I'd like to donate instead of sneakily adding it to my bill? \u00a0Maybe I would have given more, I tend to be pretty generous, but if you try to sneak it in under my nose then you are deceitful and despicable. \u00a0I won't be back; plenty of other, better, places for afternoon tea.The live string-trio was great!",

Definitely the best afternoon tea I've had in London! Savouries were all delicious (normally a let down), with lots of different variants - mini croque Monsieur, egg mayo with quails egg and caviar. Then scones good with good selection of jam. The macaroons were delish along with the pastries.

Not something I'd do every day, but definitely worth popping in for a special occasion.You get a lot of food - unlimited refills of tea, sandwiches, cakes and scones, the latter being the best part of the gluten free menu.Even the bathrooms were outstanding (to the point where I was slightly concerned that they were toilets at all, instead of part of the artwork).We didn't manage to finish our tea completely, but the lovely waitstaff packed the last of our cakes for us, which we got to enjoy later that weekend.",

As I was browsing Instagram a few days later I noticed that a ton of bloggers/YouTubers were coming to Sketch as the notable pink chairs and one-of-a-kind bathrooms were hard to miss. The food was pretty great and unlimited refills was quite great. Just let your server know which ones you like and you can get seconds/thirds of those! There is a huge variety of tea and that was quite nice to choose from. I do wish the pots were a bit smaller so I could have tried a few more - and I'm a bit sad I didn't think to buy some before I left. The decoration here is a lot of what you pay for. From the artwork hanging all over the walls to the ambiance of the lighting and the tiny details down to the furniture and dishes, this is definitely a place to experience.

    "text": "Sketch:With unsurpassed visual aesthetics amidst an eccentric, unconventional atmosphere, I knew I wanted to dine at this outlandish Michelin-awarded venue during my recent trip to London. We dined for afternoon tea in the Gallery in September 2015.I originally intended to have dinner at the Gahban O'Keeffee-designed, two-Michelin-Star rated Lecture Room & Library, menu devised by the renowned Chef Pierre Gagnaire, yet an evening reservation with Dinner by Heston Blumenthal overruled. Nevertheless, I am ecstatic with my decision to have afternoon tea in the ethereal Gallery.The pastel-pink color scheme and eclectic wall art made for great conversation. The prix-fixe afternoon tea menu featured a nice selection of tea choices, along with assorted finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries. This is an ideal venue to relax and catch up with friends over the course of an afternoon. See below for a more complete review.Reservations:Having originally held a booking for dinner in the Lecture Room and Library, we decided an afternoon affair would better suit our schedule; I made a booking for late afternoon tea. D\u00e9cor:Sketch is located on the lovely Conduit Street. Upon noticing the oversized menu and illuminated red Sketch sign, we made our way inside and walked on a hopscotch board outlined on the floor-- I knew the afternoon would be filled with fun and good food. The soign\u00e9 hostesses greeted us with exceedingly pleasant vibes and lead us to the Gallery.Our eyes immediately met the vibrant pastel pink walls and couches. The walls are also covered in art by David Shrigley-- examining each would take quite a while, but I encourage you to look closely and carefully-- some are more interesting and risqu\u00e9 than others. This overall nouveau style created a chic setting for an enjoyable afternoon.Tea Selections:There are opportunities to order and sample a variety of teas. As with most afternoon teas, selections include green, black, white, oolong, herbal, and puerh. The teapots and cups feature intriguing thoughts and words.Finger Sandwiches, Scones, and Pastries:Some of my favorites include the cucumber and ricotta sandwich, sultana scone with traditional clotted cream or strawberry and fig jam, and chocolate mint cake. By the end of the afternoon, you'll hardly be able to finish the selections, even though the staff will continually bring more of whichever item you desire.Service:The staff was pleasant, yet in typical British fashion, maintain an overall hands-off approach, which allowed us to enjoy the afternoon with minimal interruptions.Summary:We had a fantastic time enjoying Afternoon Tea at Sketch. From the splendid, unique d\u00e9cor to the delicious selection of finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, Sketch provides an enjoyable afternoon outing. While most likely no longer a secret, you must visit the bathroom or, as they referred to in the UK, the toilet or water closet-- the egg-shaped pods and psychedelic rainbow roof elevate the overall Sketch experience. My Recommendation:Go. While Afternoon Tea at Claridge's is still the ultimate afternoon tea experience in my opinion (see my review on Claridge's London), Sketch offers a great selection of afternoon treats and teas amidst an intriguing atmosphere. I will certainly return for tea in the Gallery; I also hope to return for dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. 4 StarsMichelin Stars: Two (2015)",

It was just a simple eclair with a vanilla custard filling. I thought it was good. She was obsessing over it for the remainder of our trip, pining for it like a drug addict.It's difficult for me to judge the prices and portion sizes since I'm not a local. \u00a0Being from the States, I'm used to massive portion sizes and have a general feel for what a meal should cost.But yes, if you come here you should really check out the toilets. \u00a0I've never seen such fancy toilets in my life. \u00a0Do people really need that much luxury to poop?(Just adding this down here to the last word in my review won't be \"poop\", but something else)",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for afternoon tea here after reading all the Yelp reviews and doing some research online. My expectations were met in terms of food and ambiance, but the inattentive service was enough to ruin the whole experience. We were seated immediately at our reservation time and promptly instructed on how the afternoon tea would go. The menu looked delicious and there was an abundance of teas to choose from.The bad experience started when a food runner brought over our food on a tray and placed it next to our table for our waiter to then place on our table and explain what each item was. Except, the waiter never came...not for at least 15 minutes. Our food was just sitting less than an arms distance away from us unable to be touched. The waiter finally came and instructed us to eat the warm cheese sandwich first, but of course the sandwich was no longer warm. Other than that, the sandwiches, pastries, and scones were all soooo good. I only wish I had a bigger stomach to eat more of them.Had our service been better I would have given this place five stars. The place is freaking gorgeous and the food is beautiful and delicious as well. Of course, you can't forget about the crazy bathrooms. That was an experience in itself.",

This place is like an Instagram picture: it looks amazing, but when you see it in person you say to yourself, \"That's it?\" Not to mention, the table to my right said \"The Olive Garden is way better\" and the table to my left told the waitress the place is nothing but a show, and she can tell the chef that, and bring him out so they can say it to his face. He never came out, and all they did was take off her entree and free dessert!! Laughable! The only redeemable quality about this place is the decor and cocktails. Next.",

We opted for the tea service, which included an unlimited supply of tea ( there are many different flavors) and little sandwiches. It finished off with an array of dessert.The decor/bathroom is what makes the restaurant interesting and very modern. Service was great and we got treated to a choir singing Christmas songs.The downside of this restaurant is the price. Perhaps because of the holiday, the menu was pricier, but we ended up paying $100 per person ( this didn't include any alcohol). A bit much for tea time but to enjoy it once is a must.",

The room was very pink, feminine, and had a mid-century feel, but lovely nonetheless. Christmas time meant there was a group of carolers for entertainment, which was very nice. My favorite tea was the Christmas chai, spicy and sweet. Their hot chocolate is also incredibly rich and delicious. The best part was of course the tower of sweets and snacks. I particularly loved the brie and black truffle and smoked salmon sandwiches, and all the little pastries towards the top. Its a set price for unlimited food/drinks, so its great to just sit, relax, and eat/drink as much as you fancy. Seems like a tourist hot spot given its prominence on Instagram (especially pictures of the rather psychedelic egg-shaped restroom pods), but we all had a great time.",

The circular room is small with the bar in the middle & seats around. The drinks are as unique as the room itself. The Glade was closed for a private party, but I saw The Gallery & it looked like a great spot for a girls day/night. The Parlour was a 180 degree version of The Gallery with skulls & lounge chairs. The most interesting \"room\" was the restroom. The vibrant restroom had pods that looked like Eve from the movie \"Wall-E.\" A restroom break is necessary here to check it out. There were no men in the men's side so my husband showed me the urinal. It will make you feel fancy as odd as that sounds... \u00a0 I LOVED exploring this place & its a place you won't forget!!

My date ordered the cod, which was simply salty fish. They overcharge for water too and serve it likes it's wine, how pretentious. Furthermore, oh the hidden charges! They include some type of surprise tax, in addition they include an automatic donation to some charity of theirs, oh and of course tack on their own gratuity on top of their already over-inflated prices! They really take advantage because like me, most visiting customers are too proud or shy to speak up, and quietly accept the audacity of their greed.I suppose the tea time experience is why the reviews are high, I'm not sure. But after that dinner experience, I urge you to take your money somewhere else where you can actually get a bang for your buck instead of wasting it on this posh and overly polished giant turd.",

I knew I had to go here. Sketch is one of those restaurants that you CANNOT miss out on. It's definitely not the cheapest place to go. But it is so quirky and unique you have to go see for yourself. It's a mini art museum with high class food combined together. You seriously just have to wonder what state of mind the artists were in when they created their works. They are so random.{DECOR}- The Gallery is the main room for afternoon tea - it's pink. and I mean REALLY PINK. It has chairs that look like they've had eclairs glued onto them and the lovely rainbow bathroom with egg booths. - The walls are lined with 200+ \"sketches\" which you'll have a fun time looking at.{BOOKING} - Reservations can be made up to 2 months in advance.- They do take your CC in case you don't show up (there is a fine) \u00a0{SERVICE}- The service here is THE BEST. Every time I went to pee (which when you're drinking tea non stop for an hour is a lot) they folded up my napkin and helped me out of my chair. - They clear out the table every time they put new food on the table, and they are so so so attentive! You've just got to look over and they will come on right over. - They are so incredibly kind. I commented that the bag to take away food was super cute and the manager offered to give me one as well! - The envelope to get the bill is made out of SANDPAPER. And while my family was oozing over it the manager laughingly also told us we could keep it. \u00a0{AFTERNOON TEA}- At \u00a338/person (59USD), we're on the high end here. If you want champagne it's about \u00a310 extra. But this is 100% worth the price. The service, atmosphere and food just blows my mind. - FREE REFILLS! - Oh yes, eat as many of those little strawberry tarts and drink as much tea as you want. - You can take all your leftover food home! - 2 hour maximum time.- All of the food was so delicious. I was stuffed by the time we left. {RECOMMENDED TEAS}- Jasmine Pearls- Earl Grey Supreme: Can you ever go wrong with this?- Ceylon & Rose- Vanilla Tea",

    "text": "I feel late in jumping on the Sketch bandwagon, because like, everyone I know who does food/restaurants in London has already been here, but I recently came for lunch in the parlour with a friend before he moved. I convinced him to come because \"you can't leave London without eating at Sketch,\" and based on my previous suggestions for our meals out, he was interested.First impressions were good--the host was very nice and realized who I was despite my lost looking-ness, and directed me by name to my friend. That's the kind of thing you want to stick in people's minds.The parlour itself is beautiful, like a funky dream place from Alice and Wonderland. Filled with interesting things to look at, we tucked into a table near the window and enjoyed the sun while we waited for our orders to be taken.Here's the tough part: we waited.At a place like Sketch, especially for lunch on a Thursday where the parlour is maybe 1/3 full, waiting shouldn't be part of the equation. Much less should we have had to flag down service each time we wanted something.We ordered the burger, chips, and the macaroni cheese. I was pleased with my mac-cheese, but my friend was disappointed in the size of his burger. As a guy, I understand, because it was nowhere near enough to fill a person, much less for the prices we were paying. I especially dislike letting down people with my recommendations, which is another strike in my mind.The decoration is of course cool--I had the chance to walk through and look at the other dining rooms on the way to the coolest bathroom in London (though I do have an issue with the idea of having such an obviously hip, gender-neutral bathroom color coded in pink and blue... stereotyping much?? What about individuals who don't identify as \"blue\" or \"pink\"?). It seems like a nice place for a really great experience, at a really high price. I will probably be back to see the dining rooms in action one night... but it's only for the visual experience, not the eating or customer service.",

As mentioned in other reviews, this is a building with several functions. We went to the Lecture Room upstairs. This is an upscale French cuisine, with a special ambience with lots of details to call your attention, starting from the doorman. \u00a0The building is the former Chanel House, we were told, and captures all the glamour of London and the old buildings around the area. \u00a0And more.Service is amazing starting at the front door and as you goes upstair enter it gives you already a sense that it will be a special evening. The menu isn't extensive but it is interesting enough to call your attention. However, when food comes and you taste it you realize that is above all expectations, simply delicious.... I had the duck, which came with the best fois- gras that I had in my life. My husband had the lamb, equally outstanding. We did not asked for starters, but they surprised us with small bites of heaven. \u00a0The experience was repeated for dessert. We should have taken photos of the food, but we missed it. \u00a0It will be one more reason to come back. And we definitively will, whenever we are in London. Hopefully, \u00a0we will come back soon to take our \u00a0daughter there, she will love it as well. \u00a0I guess this will be a enw London favorite!",

Everyone is really great, very attentive, helpful, kind - I cannot fault it anywhere. The only thing I would suggest is perhaps follow the good reviews on here and go for afternoon tea. We went for dinner and left unimpressed, which is a real shame. The starters were good but the main dish (we both got the same - chicken fricassee) was bland and flavorless. It was as if the chicken was boiled. Perhaps the other dishes are better. As for desserts, 1 was really great (praline/hazelnut one) while the Sketch chocolate dessert left much to be desired. Perhaps it comes down to choice -and if you make better choices the experience will be far more enjoyable.",

We asked if we could have dessert in another room as it is a very large, cavernous space, and were told there would be some tables opening up soon next door but we must pay for our meal so far before leaving the table. We attempted to enter the bar next door for dessert but discovered that the menu would not be the same.

What I'd suggest you do is book a table at Bentley's in Piccadilly instead. That is a truly gourmet experience at a decent price",

This place is strange, in a good way. We only paid for one drink the entire night. Free bottles of alcohol plus pod shaped bathroom stalls?? Quite interesting. Sketch lives up to its name. We certainly will never forget this place.",

    "text": "[Non-Photo Review] For full post (with pictures) see: wp.me/pwXBH-qk \u00a0sketch Lecture Room & Library \u00a0Gastronomic Theatre Fit for a King Opening: Be transported into a surreal and magical world that is sealed off from the mundane trappings of the everyday world. You have ascended to the upper echelons of sketch, and you are here to be looked after. Let the food dazzle and delight; permit the grand surroundings mesmerize; allow your whims be catered for; and, most of all, enjoy every minute...because it don't come cheap! No ordinary townhouse Let me preface this review by saying that I have been to sketch once before, so it wasn't a complete shock to me when I walked in this time. One of our friends had somehow managed to secure one of the bars for her birthday drinks and Mrs. LF and I were introduced to the decadent, avant-garde madness that lies beyond this Georgian townhouse's rather ordinary looking white facade. If you've never been and are planning to go, whichever part of sketch you decide to visit, do insist on visiting the bathrooms on the ground floor that lie through The Gallery dining room as they are certainly worth seeing. Yes, sketch. A London institution that has somehow managed to retain its en vogue status since opening its doors six years ago, which is no mean feat given the constantly sprouting up competition. But we were not there to celebrity spot; we were there to eat some good food. And that meant stepping into the upper echelons of this mysterious and quirky little world. We were there for The Lecture Room and Library, the 1-starred Michelin dining room that is run under the close control of Pierre Gagnaire (who is apparently present every 4-6 weeks for a number of days), the acclaimed French chef whose iconoclastic modern fusion style of cooking seems rather well suited toward the raison d'\u00eatre of sketch. No ordinary greeting When we 'checked in' at the little reception desk, David, the tall and charmingly flamboyant Irish man who seemed to be in charge, became very animated when he learned we would be dining upstairs. He offered us a tour of the premises, to be carried out by his rather fetching assistant, but we opted to postpone this until the end of the evening. We also declined the offer of a cocktail in one of the downstairs bars as we had already had that pleasure at our friend's birthday celebration. I should say that the cocktails at sketch are imaginative, fun and excellent \u00a0but they are also probably the most expensive drinks I've ever bought in a London bar. Mrs. LF told our host that we'd rather just go upstairs. He then informed us that, as we were the first guests to arrive, we could have the upstairs parlour to ourselves. Now that sounded like a plan. While attempting to ascertain our knowledge of chef Gagnaire, he opened the roped-off stairs for us and with a grand gesture and bid us to follow him up the stairs. As we ascended, he informed us about all of the chef's restaurants around the globe and gave us a potted biography of Mr. Gagnaire in his very pleasant but thoroughly OTT fashion. We noticed some of the intriguing artwork on the way up to our destination, and were indeed being made to feel like we were quite special guests at this most hoity-toity of establishments. But of course that felt very good. When you reach the top of the stairs, there is a large doorway which remains sealed. Then, in his special way, our leader opened the vault, revealing what is probably the most striking dining room I've ever had the pleasure of stepping foot into. Our photos, most other photos I've seen, and even the professional video cameras from the recent episode of Masterchef: The Professionals simply don't do the place justice. It is something to be seen in person, that's for sure. You really feel like you've entered an extremely exclusive and luxurious place that is sealed off from the rest of the world. While Mrs. LF made her way back downstairs to powder her nose, I had the good fortune to meet the chef, Jean-Denis Le Bras, who recently took over the upstairs kitchen. He was very pleasant and clearly enthusiastic about his food. Upon her return, Mrs. LF and I walked through the main dining room (which I presumed to be the 'Lecture Room'), and the smaller ante-chamber (which I assumed to be the 'Library'), which led into a very beautiful little parlour area, replete with rich reds, fireplace and Moroccan style window hangings and light fixtures. After downing my favorite sketch cocktail, whose name now escapes me but I think has something to do with Barry White, we were offered an array of canap\u00e9s, which we decided to have in the parlour as it was so cosy and we were having such a nice time there. Without going into laborious detail, it is suffice to say that this was a magnificent opening to our meal. Each element on the tray tasted every bit as good as it looked \u00a0which is saying something with the goat's cheese tarts and yogurt with tandoori biscuits being our",

    "text": "I've been to Sketch's restaurant a couple of times for lunch and really enjoyed it - as well as the food, I love the decor and the theatre of it all. I'd highly recommend lunch there on a sunny day - when they whisk you up the stairs and throw open the doors onto the dining room, the light and colour is just spectacular. I think this was also the first place I dined where my handbag was brought it's very own seat at the table, which was a delightful touch, and made it feel so special! I've had afternoon tea in the parlour before too, which is fun, although usually very busy. But it was only recently that I noticed they also do a breakfast/ brunch menu (served until noon), so this review is primarily focusing on that.I went for the Parlour Breakfast scrambled eggs and smoked salmon option, which is not my usual choice, but it was absolutely delicious. Beautifully served, the eggs were the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too firm. The salmon came in a separate side dish and was melt in your mouth delicate, with an accompaniment of lightly cooked tomatoes, and toast. I liked that all the constituent parts were on separate plates enabling you to build your own breakfast as you ate, and it meant that the toast stayed crunchy, the salmon kept cool and the tomatoes didn't leach into the eggs.Other options include their take on a full English or continental breakfast, eggs benedict, pastries, porridge, muesli and fruit, so there's a decent, albeit fairly traditional, selection on offer.And of course given their focus on afternoon tea, they have an extensive range of teas and herbal infusions available, although on this occasion I went for a cafeti\u00e8re of one of the \"rare and exotic\" coffees, which was just right. I will definitely be finding a reason to brunch here again!",

A real-life bizarre dream. Sketch has different rooms with different atmospheres and a restaurant between the bars. The bar which you would first walk in has a calmer ambience with elegant yet crazy furniture. The room on the far end is very small and much darker with a bar in the middle of the room. The bar sits lower than the ground floor so that you are much taller than the barmen. Prices are quite shocking but the cocktails were nice. Definitely not amazing. And it took at least 25 minutes for two cocktails to come. The service was top notch. Great staff, handsome men at the doors and between each bar standing straight and elegantly. Sketch",

We were highly disappointed with our experience. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived on time and were seated right away with barely a greeting or a smile. The waitress hastily dropped our menus and walked away. When she came back to take our drink order she was visibly annoyed when my sister and I (we were with our mother) requested sparkling water and no cocktails (my mom ordered a martini). It was clear that from this point forward we were an afterthought as we were not a high \"money making/bill running\" table (since we were not planning to drink.) As she kindly described the menu and specials to other tables around us as they sipped their cocktails, we were simply asked if we were ready. We ordered at 9:40 after being asking twice and our meal was delivered by 9:50. It was clear our table was being rushed out the door to turn us over quickly. we felt very upset as this was our last night and we wanted an experience and not to be rushed in and out. My mother asked to speak with a manager and he was so arrogant and rude that it was inexplicable. the customer is never right at sketch!!! he gave her a great deal of attitude when she explained she felt upset. The whole staff was pretentious and rude \u00a0and this restaurant is HIGHLY OVERRATED. Not worth it, an awful experience and highly overpriced with a disrespectful staff to match.

Most people come here for the afternoon tea which is stacked full of delicious sweet treats but they also do a great lunch menu with one of the best foie gras burgers I have ever tasted. Came here once for a set menu dinner too which turned out to be too good to be true. Food was strangely just not up to scratch but maybe that was just a one time offence. I forgive you Sketch. Now let's talk about their toilets. Their awesome individual egg shaped toilets with soothing bird chirps to sing you to poops. Let's not forget the cleaner wondering around in a French maid outfit and their colourful stained glass ceiling. Ahh it's all so magical.",

If you think afternoon tea is boring, too frou-frou, for grandmas, or just a waste of money, come to Sketch! You'll definitely see afternoon tea in a new light and lose a few pounds while you're at it. Har, har, har. (I heard the British like puns. Okay, bad joke.)This tea is on the pricey side but worth every pence. It includes unlimited tea and food service within your two hour time frame and you don't have to be embarrassed at all when asking for seconds. As chic and cool the ladies are here, they are very nice and accommodating. They are also very patient. I took pictures of everything and held up service. Yes, I was one of those people but who could blame me? Sketch was meant to be photographed and social media-ed out. Actually, you really have to experience it yourself. Its an amazing place.We really took our time and enjoyed our tea, sandwiches, and sweets. And when we were done, we walked all around the Gallery to giggle at the very witty sketches. As the British would say, \"Absolutely brilliant.\"Also, don't wait too long to use the loo. It's a conversation piece for sure.Hopscotch ya later~",

My memory of sketch were three main themes: artsy interior decoration, egg pods toilets from the future and innovative high tea. Upon our arrival, the receptionist led us to walk through a hall way, passed the giant dinning room then to our tea room. Walking in the tea room,you would feel that you are Alice in wonderland !!! The high tea was lovely with assorted finger sandwiches. The sandwich with quail eggs and caviar was my favorite. I also like the one with sliced asparagus/ cucumber on top. The scones were soft inside and crunchy on the skin. They made a perfect match with jam and clotted cream. The selection of pastries were fantastic. The portion is large enough for your sugar high whole week. Last but not least : egg pods toilet from the future!!! Interesting art pieces and have fun taking pictures with them folks!!!!",

If you've seen a picture, you've had plenty of the experience. The food is subpar and overly sugary. The service is quite slow. Though they say you can order unlimited tea, good luck getting your server's attention when you want more. It's a fascinating gallery, but for high tea in particular, I don't want to pay 70 quid to look at art that a 10 year old could have made while constantly struggling to flag down my server. I would recommend a more classic place for high tea, where you actually get a traditional experience and your money's worth.",

It combines so many things I like, ambiance, cocktails, art, vintage feel, and cake, ooft.It's quirky, like going to drink in an art gallery, which is unsurprisingly what one of the dining rooms is called, and you can tell that Turner prize winners have had a touch on this. Pink velvet chairs, that reminded me of packs of sausages, and so comfortable, it feels kind of like an old fashioned ice cream parlour, the walls lined with artwork. Every room in this place is dramatic. You can sit in the pink sausage chairs feeling all jazz age and have cocktails brought to you by charming waiters and waitresses (there's a cocktail bar tucked below the loos, but the egg shaped loo pods filled with trilling birds is a whole other story).The forest room is beautiful too, and the cocktails are rather lovely.

The place was quite easy to find, especially once you found yourself in the high end retail shopping area. I walked in charmed by the atmosphere, and my door was opened by one of the employees. To my left, I saw the Alice in Wonderland room and to my right, I found the pink room where I would be having afternoon tea. I was underdressed. I'll admit I just landed in Heathrow hours before, and so appearing in jeans and a decent blouse they thought I was a tourist just wondering in. They asked me if I was lost. I was baffled, but found it quite funny. As soon as I relayed that I had a reservation, they brought me to my table of 1. In the background, I heard a duet of violinists playing covers of popular songs. It was beautiful. The food and presentation was also fabulous! You had endless refills of everything except the champagne. Sad, eh?If you are coming to London once and have an extra dime (definitely just a saying in this context), stop at Sketch.

We ended up upgrading to the one that includes a glass of champagne which I can't remember how much it was but about 57 pounds. It's worth every \"pound.\" All the pastieries, scones and sandwiches were amazing but by far my favorite was the grilled cheese. Yummm!!!! On the other hand the bathrooms were unbelievable. It was two stair cases going up on each side of a round roomWith a cocktails bar inside. The toilets upstairs looked like cocoon shaped spaceships . It was so unique!

Things got off to a rocky start when our waitress assumed I was male (spoiler: I'm not!). She profusely apologized which made it more awkward as other tables began to look over. Also, the bathroom situation is more weird and uncomfortable than cool. They are these bizarre white pods. The bathroom attendant tried to usher me over to the men's side, making things again extremely uncomfortable.I guess women can't have short hair in the UK.Anyway, on to food/drinks. I had the invisible cocktail which was delicious. It was more sweet than I usually care for, but delicious none the less. My girlfriend had a carafe of wine, to be honest I don't know which one, but she enjoyed it none the less.For appetizers, we had the white asparagus which was pretty good. The best part was the herb veloute sauce it came in. We also had the Potato and Thyme bread which was yummy as well.For dinner, I had the Aubergine and black garlic tortellini. It was delicious! The baby aubergine and zucchini that accompanied the tortellini were delicious. My girlfriend had the Veal Milanese and a side of mashed potatoes. I tried a bite of the veal which was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were dry and I thought I would choke trying to swallow them. Overall, I'm glad we came here. The decor and vibe is fun and trendy (we sat in The Gallery room) but the food is nothing to rave about. Although I will say it was one of the better meals we had while visiting.",

Definitely make a reservation. I booked my in advance and I also booked the earliest available which was nice to walk around and take pictures easily. The attention to detail is amazing. From the hop scotch entrance, the menu, the bathroom... everything is so thought out and stylized. The bathrooms are so cool, they are a must to go in. The afternoon tea food was small but I was surprisingly very full when I was done. You also get some additional things like a biscuit and egg thing that were good. You technically get unlimited food but what they gave was enough, and I had about 3 pots of tea. The passion fruit one was yummy. If you're visiting it's a great spot to go to that feels very chic!",

While in London, I knew I had to stop here for a tea party, since I first saw the gorgeous interior that resembles a Wes Anderson movie set of the Gallery, and the bathroom of individual giant egg shaped potty's with bird sounds once inside, resembling Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: Space Odyssey from yes, an Instagram post by Kimberly Gordon of Selkie & Wildfox. All about the aesthetically pleasing presentation and tasty. It's not cheap, but it is worth it, particularly for a birthday or date ideal, very charming.I arrived a bit early so I had a cocktail in the lounge, also cute lots of neon as I awaited.I went for afternoon tea, I had the Oriental Beauty Tea, which was subtle and complimented the sweet deserts, pastries and finger food sammiches. speaking of design, the menu was adorable, and tells a story of each course, and item. The plates may seem small but I was full by the time the cake came out I could hardly eat it! favorite sandwhiches were my favorite.I would highly suggest reservations are made ahead of time up to possibly two weeks in advanced, as this place books fast and might not have openings.",

    "text": "When I thought of doing high tea in London, I imagined stuffy atmospheres with a crowd that wasn't my own. When I was told about sketch, though, I knew I found my sweet spot and dream spot to have my first appropriate high tea.Sketch was Alice in Wonderland meets high fashion meets acid trip art...and it all went incredibly well together. We made a reservation for tea (this is a MUST!) and were seated in a corner booth that oversaw their entirely pink tearoom. From the couches to the paint to the waitstaff's outfits/uniforms, there wasn't a surface that wasn't touched with this color. With that and the quirky artwork on the walls, it really set the tone for what would be a unique experience.We did the tea with a glass of ros\u00e9 to add some bubbles to our meal. Admittedly, I was nervous about the menu because there items on it (quail egg and caviar, to name a few) which I never imagined myself eating, and I was so surprised by how every sandwich and dessert I had I liked. And not only did I enjoy every bite, but I left feeling beyond full; like, top button undone full.The most important item to have liked would have been the tea and, needless to say, it was incredible. I had a black tea that had notes of vanilla to it and another tea that was lightly infused with rose buds. The latter was so good I ordered two pots of it. Overall, it was a brilliant high tea and I can't wait to fly back to London and return to Sketch!Oh. And the bathrooms are like an episode of Black Mirror - slightly eerie but very intriguing. Can't say I've ever peed in a giant bird's egg before.",

The drink selection is interesting... but that's about as far as it goes.So if you're coming for the food, do yourself a favor and switch it to just come for drinks or tea, just to experience how incredible the place itself is.",

It was like being in a beautiful painting. It has a forest theme, which can be seen everywhere from the walls and ceiling to the carpet which actually looks like grass, to the food. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the portions are really small and I think it's a little overpriced. However, the ambience makes up for it and the food is tasty. There were 2 of us and we had the 3 course lunch. I had the spaghetti courgette for starters, which was a great combination of flavors. For mains I had the steak which was a little chewy. It could definitely be improved. The dessert was by far my favourite. I ordered the chocolate biscuit which was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend it! My brother had the red fruits with red fruit sorbet which was refreshing and tangy.Do go to the bathroom on your visit- one of the most creative designs I've ever seen! Overall a great place for a Sunday lunch.",

(May be until the bill hits you where it really hurts but it is so worth it if taste matters to you as much as it matters to me). Just get the preset menu, forget about taking notes and trying critique individual courses. Taking notes would be an inappropriate distraction from a sensual taste experience. The drawback: My fellow Yelper cannot get detailed recollections, because describing heavenly taste experiences in words is not so easy - and probably impossible for me to express the wonders in words. Of course I also had wonderful company; friends from Boston whom we seem to run into in different countries. Remarkably, one of these friends has a seafood allergy - what a curse. But Sketch handled it better than any other place. We skipped the wine pairing. I was tempted (as always) but not everyone in our party was enzymatically capable. Hence, we got a Sancerre rose bottle (or two) which worked well through out dinner. WINNER!",

We made reservations 2 weeks in advance.Arrived at the restaurant 10 mins early. The host said that we were early and will not be able to seat us until our reservation time. Our reservation time came and went. They seated everyone else who came after us. Kept apologizing for overbooking. 40 mins into the wait, the host pointed to a small table by the entrance occupied by an old couple. Said as soon as they were done with their meal, they will set it up for 4 people. They did not look like they were closed to finishing. At that point, we gave up and left.",

    "text": "This is one of those bucket list places for me. When I was looking for places to go in London, I found this place because of all the amazing photos of their bathroom, pink tea room and entry way. When I walked in, the tea room and bathroom took my breath away. The service here is next level as they have multiple waiters to assist with setting up the tea. They also have an upgraded tea with caviar and champagne. My brother and I chose the upgraded tea and were promptly given champagne and our caviar. The tea options were great, they had the traditional teas as well as others that were different. The plate of snacks they give you is ample with the coronation chicken salad being my favorite. The waiter also slid us a few more sandwiches at our request. If you are in London, do yourself a favor and give an afternoon to Sketch",

    "text": "I came to Sketch for some drinks with friends while visiting London. \u00a0The bar decor is a bit uber-bizarre, including the quite anatomically correct dog(s) statue in the entrance, the bar that only comes up to your knees, and the very strange pod bathrooms that make you feel like you're in an alien egg. \u00a0I think the fact that we were there on a Wednesday night (making the place almost empty) may have added to the strangeness... It would probably feel a little more \"cool\" and a little less \"creepy\" if there were more people around.Evidently, Sketch has been awarded a Michelin Star, and the quality that suggests shows up even in their cocktails. \u00a0There were three of us there, and we each had two drinks, so I (math whiz) got to try 6 of their drinks. \u00a0Every single one was delicious. \u00a0I especially enjoyed the \"Duvel in Me\" drink, which incorporated one of my favorite beers into a cocktail expertly. \u00a0Yes, it's a bit pricey, but this isn't the type of place that you're going to have 10 drinks at (well I suppose that I shouldn't say that for sure, but definitely not when it's a Wednesday and you're jet-lagged from coming in from Chicago the day before!)I almost forgot to mention... the WC Pods are quite an experience. \u00a0Mine had barn-yard animal noises coming through the speakers. \u00a0I am not kidding.",

    "text": "I had afternoon tea here and I hate to say it, but I wasn't hugely impressed. As many of the reviews here rightly point out, the venue itself is amazing, and there's something extra special about turning off a busy Regent St and ducking into this charming maze of quirky grandiosity. But I digress. The afternoon tea itself was really delicious. I should disclose at this point that \u00a0gluten and I do not get along, so afternoon tea always requires a bit of compromise for me. However in the course of my fledgling love affair with this quintessentially English way to spend the pre-twilight hours, I have learned that the swisher establishments can usually cater accordingly. My lovely wife has no such handicap, so she was able to enjoy the full offering as the chef intended it, and it looked delicious - particularly the sweetish glazed smoked salmon buns. Not that I'm bitter. Really.The first problem was our seating. We were in the parlour, which is where they accommodate the overflow from the front room. It's a nice room in itself - warm pinkish tones and pleasantly spacious, but we were tucked away into a corner behind the door and the effect wasn't so cosy. There were three staff in the area but they seemed to struggle with the demands of the room. The real problem was with the presentation of the food. They brought out each person's entire meal on a lovely looking cake stand. While this looked good, it didn't really work because the scones come out warm, as they should, but they're not the first course so by the time we got to them, they were cold.My sandwiches were nice, but the gluten-free bread was nothing special. But the real disappointment for me was that when I asked for more, I was told that I would have to order off the menu. Now I've only eaten afternoon tea at two other places, but both times the extra sandwiches flowed freely. And at \u00a327 per person, I reckon Sketch can afford to get a little more generous with their precious sarnies. The sweets were delicious, and so too was the tea. But we were hustled out after an hour and a half, when we could have done with an extra 20 minutes or so.Basically it was good, but not great. There are a few too may buts that need to be addressed before they can be considered in the league of places like Claridge's, which definitely served the best afternoon tea that I've ever had. That said, Sketch is still worth a visit, but maybe just for one of their fancy (\u00a315ish) cocktails.",

We were greeted my a number of beautiful people at every door and each one of them was more accommodating than the next. The ambience and decor \u00a0were incredible with the dim colored lighting and white hand-painted \"antique\" furniture. There were images of bubbles projected on the walls creating a fantasy-like atmosphere. And going with the bubble theme the restrooms were these singluar white pods, everything was very pristine and sexy. \u00a0Dinner was lovely, I had the lamb (that was perfectly cooked) which was accompanied my some coco beans, celery slivers and yogurt dollops on what seemed to be a sweet cracker of some sort. \u00a0My dinner guests had the salmon and the ribeye which they polished off as well. \u00a0DInner was followed my this delicious chocolate cake with a lemon/ginger custard. \u00a0Yum!The reason I took off 1 star was due to the fact that out waiter was rude. \u00a0Well, I take that back, he was very rude to my flatmate. \u00a0The 3 of us could not figure out why but it seemed that everything he ordered the waiter judged. \u00a0It was a little comical after a while but at the same time there was no reason for Pierre/Jean-Louis/Francois to be as rude as he was.There are also a few cocktail bars in this venue that you either have to be a member of or have dined there that night to enjoy. \u00a0The 2 that customers can enjoy were both very unique. One was tiny and followed along the bubble theme as it was this round pod with a sunken bar in the middle and the other was more of a lounge with great lighting effects. \u00a0I highly recommend going just for the atmosphere alone.",

Didn't realize all the perks you get if you're a member!The whole place had a artsy/Damien Hirst vibe to it. Like the dog humping statue, alien pod restrooms, and the trendy dining room. The staff was amazing, shook our hands and greeted us by Mr. X and Miss. X. 2 glasses of champagne was at our table. The food was good, nothing too memorable about it. I was just in awe of all the great looking people walking around (both the staff and the customers). Afterwards, we headed to the members only bar which was very cool. Really good cocktails - watermelon martinis are my fave. DJ was playing alot of great music as well, and everyone was up and dancing!I also loved the fact they had a smoking jacket by the door that they offered to guests when you headed outside for a smoke break. Big black fur coats are GREAT to smoke in cold London weather. Anyways, I am definitely coming back again.",

I love offbeat art, and as soon as you walk past the coat check, the statue of dogs having sex kind of sets the tone for what you'll find inside. London is one of those cities where you can get away with dangling dead birds and laser lights over people and still charge them 4.75 for a bottle of Asahi as long as you make them feel like they've done something fabulous to have made it in the door. I think there's two ways you can look at the place, another reviewer mentioned that they don't seem to take themselves too seriously, but I'd argue that they take themselves very seriously. \u00a0There's a lot of work that goes into looking that nonchalant, kind of in that way where the indie crowd spends hours on their hair to make it look like they've just rolled out of bed. Visually, I do love the place, but I think my visits are going to be sparse in the future as it's just not something I could justify the spend for on a regular basis. Certainly worth a stop in if you haven't been. \u00a0You know, when in Rome...",

Although it was said to be quite posh, it wasn't at all as intimidating as I was expecting. The food was good, but portions were a bit small. The best part, though, was checking out the bathroom. We heard a woman at a table near us saying that it was the best bathroom she'd ever seen. My husband went to check it out first and he couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the meal. At the end of the meal I made my way to the bathroom and was amazed! It was truly an odd, wonderful, crazy, little place & would definitely recommend breakfast or tea there.",

While you're there, take a walk around the place. \u00a0The different rooms have different atmospheres. \u00a0As you walk toward the back, the stairs to the left appear as if they are covered with wet blood, although this is only an illusion. \u00a0The stairs to the right lead down to a library-like dining room, as well as a large white dining room, which was not in use when I was there. \u00a0You have to walk through this room to get to the infamous white egg pod bathroom, but it can be a little creepy. \u00a0As I walked through the completely dark and empty room, I could hear the sound of someone chewing/eating, emanating from the speakers.",

    "text": "Here on a honeymoon trip, our last night in London. We were so excited to see Sketch. We had the best time in London at all of the other top restaurants and bars and expected the same here. 2 hours spent here in total, with about an hour and 15 mins of just waiting. We sit down,l and \u00a0no one came or offereds us water for 20 mins. I dont think you realize how long 20 mins is until you just sit there at a restaurant. It also took us 30 mins to get our bill. As in, we looked around for our waitress for a full 30 mins. She could tell we had terrible service our entire meal and did not do anything to try and end our experience on a good note. If you want to eat here, go for it but I'm sure you will not want to come back. Our dinner was at 10:30pm by the way, so not during what would be considered \"dinner rush\" either. If this restaurant wants to keep repeat customers, you need to staff more wait staff to keep the tables turning. They're still basically full with the exception of a couple of tables so you should not have two or three waiters for the whole room. The decor is quite beautiful and you get pretty photos, but we all have Google for that now. Save yourselves $120 (for two people, we skipped apps as we were starving by the time they got us our water and cocktail menus). The quality of your hospitality and service is everything at a restaurant. I'm sure we will be back to London for business and pleasure, and I'm pretty sure we won't be back here.",

    "text": "It's taken me a while to write this review (possibly due to the ensuing sugar coma) but I took my uber cool sister to afternoon tea here for her birthday.I knew from the moment we stepped inside the red-lit entrance hall that I'd picked the perfect place for her - my sis is creative, arty and trendy in that 'I'm-not-even-trying' way, and the woman that greeted us looked like a work of art herself. I actually had to do a double-take as she stood even taller than me, wearing 4-inch platform heels, cropped trousers, statement necklace, bright lips and a completely bald head. I had to stifle an embarrassing gasp as she stepped out of nowhere, almost android-like, and referred to her iPad. I was simultaneously relieved I'd made an effort with my own outfit and excited about seeing the rest of the place after this start.It didn't let me down - we were seated in the outer garden-themed room by the bar, which was open and airy thanks to the skylight and decorated with leafy vines and greenery. It all felt a little Alice in Wonderland (though without a mad hatter in sight) as we sat on cutely mismatched garden furniture; I took my usual spot next to the bookshelf :)Tea was delicious - though be warned it's heavily biased to sweet over savoury versus other teas in London. The sandwiches were fine but over quickly and it's two tiers of sweet tooth heaven from then on. The key component to impress me on is always the scones, which arrived separately and were fabulously soft-not-crumbly here and nicely warmed through, with generous amounts of clotted cream (always a must). After that, the third dessert chapter was also delicious, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - possibly too much?! There's 2 full tiers of little cakes and dessert pots which are all so incredibly sweet that it's difficult for even a seasoned after tea-er like myself to finish everything they offer you, let alone any refills.The service was attentive and friendly throughout, and I was glad we were seated in the light garden room, particularly when I walked through the larger inner room which had a different feel completely - more cave-like and much dimmer. That walk led me to the now-legendary toilets here, which reminded me of that scene in Godzilla when Matthew Broderick finds the eggs in Madison Square Garden. Only with multi-coloured lights on the ceiling and very bright white 'eggs'. In fact each pod is a toilet cubicle complete with its own sound system - mine seemed to be playing an old radio broadcast whilst my sister's played animal noises. It's a little confusing (still not sure whether there's separate guy/girl pods) but makes going to the loo an adventure in itself!It all added to the slightly wacky arty vibe that shows they have a sense of humour behind all the serious art on the walls, and meant we were very happy to while away a few hours sipping tea refills, people-watching the very well put together crowd, and trying to find more dessert stomach space. It's a relatively reasonable price tag of \u00a335 for the full package you get, and my fave for a slightly quirky afternoon tea in London. They rotate the artists and room themes too - yet another reason to go back again :)",

I made a reservation online for afternoon tea in the Gallery Room about two weeks prior and there were a lot of openings. When I first arrived, I was greeted promptly by the friendly host.When you first enter Sketch, you're already in awe because of its decor. Each room has a different set up/theme....even the bathroom! It is gorgeous!When I first entered the Gallery Room, I was simply amazed. The decor totally sets the tone for afternoon tea with a loved one, friends or family.Service was beyond my expectations. Our lovely server was super attentive, friendly and helpful. Other members of the staff came by to help and they were all pleasant as well.The finger sandwiches and desserts that come with afternoon are all delicious! You can get free refills on all of the items, so do ask for more! My favorites were the finger sandwich with quail egg and caviar on top, the strawberry/raspberry cheesecake, early grey macaron, and the chocolate cake. I ordered the Black Currant Hibiscus tea and that was lovely. It was sweet and very flavorful. Overall, my experience at Sketch was beyond my expectation. I would definitely come back here again when I am in London. Tips:--Sketch is walkable distance from Piccadilly Circus Underground Station. It's about a 8-10 minute walk.--Make a reservation. They usually are fully booked o the weekends. --You can get free refills on all the sandwiches and desserts that come with your afternoon tea. --You can try another tea for no additional charge. --There is a 2 hour maximum.",

    "text": "Sketch is quirky, it's imaginative, and it's thoroughly fun - both in terms of food and atmosphere. For example, the food ranges from strange dishes to classics to re-inventions of classic dishes with a cheeky addition of something you would never add but sort of works. My club sandwich had beetroot jelly and crayfish in it. Usually I like a club sandwich with chicken, bacon and mayo in it. My tastebuds were shocked but not in an entirely terrible way.We visited the parlour, which is less formal than the other two eating rooms in Sketch. You can order what you want when you want, unlike the other two rooms which are more suitable for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. As you walk in, you see a bar with lots of delicious looking and colourful cakes stacked high. Try and avoid that temptation. We couldn't! After my club sandwich I had a chocolate and coffee tart, which was heavier on the coffee side than the chocolate. That disappointed me a bit as I don't think you should ever have less chocolate in your life...In the room, I was mesmerised by the different types of people. There was a fabulous old lady near us who had come in alone for a martini and cake and was reading a book. I want to be like that in a few years. There were some bloggers taking pics of their cake and cocktails and there were groups of friends. For some reason, there were very few men in the room. Maybe that's because the portions are on the small side or maybe it's because men don't appreciate \u00a0the quirkiness - they come to eat, then leave.If it were for the toilets alone - individual cubicles shaped like eggs where men and women share the same wash basins it would get five solid stars. Six if I could give it six. The cubicles play bird song music, for goodness sake. But it is expensive for small portion sizes, my desert wasn't chocolatey enough and I'm still not convinced they needed to tamper with a classic club sandwich.",

    "text": "We booked in advance for afternoon tea and I must say I was pretty eager to sit at that beautiful pink room. First time we showed up there hoping for a walk in, \"no could do\": we were offered to take the same tea in another room, but I decided to just place a booking for another time because I needed to inject a good dose of pinkness on my instagram feed. :)The pink room is as beautiful as you can imagine, a bit darker than I expected but it certainly improves the ambience, as bright lights in restaurants just kill the mood. Crank up your camera's ISO and you'll be fine. :D The service is impeccable; smiling and awfully polite staff as it should be. Soon after being seated I was informed that they were having a \"special\" afternoon tea event \u00a0(extra charge). I didn't really understand but didn't complain; I was just looking forward my treat. But I do recommend checking carefully before booking as the surcharge was substantial.Teas were delicious and you can chose from an interesting selection. The crockery fun and it's available to buy, if you can afford it. :) Usually the weakest part of an afternoon tea for me are the sandwiches, the same boring classics your nan would've put on your lunch box, often dried out bread + meagre fillings. Not here: the offerings are interesting, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I was indeed very happy that they give you refills. The scones were nicely done, warm and the perfect texture; the cakes were more like desserts, not the classic slices you'd get at traditional places (and not the best part, in my opinion) but tasty enough and very well presented. thankfully not a tacky cupcake in sight here. In the end we were offered one extra sweet and then finished our teas at leisure. We left satisfied and recommending the experience to our friends. please do pop to the loos at some point, as like everyone here pointed out they're worth having a look.",

    "text": "It seems the main reason to visit sketch is for the ambiance, and I love that each room is a work of art. The 'forest room' is a great spot for an evening drink. The Gallery is lovely although they keep it a bit dark for my liking, and the pink sofas are looking a bit tatty and could probably be reupholstered. The bathrooms are definitely the highlight- they are just so unique and gorgeous!Afternoon tea: \u00a345 per person and the food was delicious- my friend and I especially loved the savory sandwiches and the scones. The tea and food is unlimited, so if you're feeling especially hungry you can ask for more of everything! We definitely requested extras of our favorite sandwiches (grilled cheese, smoked salmon, and coronation chicken) and only felt slightly cheeky doing so. The service at tea was superb. Everyone that works in The Gallery is incredibly nice and helpful and they always made sure we had plenty of food and warm tea. We left feeling very stuffed and content! Drinks: I returned another evening for drinks at sketch and was not as impressed as with the tea. We explored each of the rooms until settling on the forest room for some cocktails, where a waiter showed us to a table but then promptly ignored us for quite a while. When we finally flagged down someone to take our orders, they were friendly enough, but took about 20 minutes to bring over the drinks. The cocktails were fine but nothing special. Given that we had popped in for a quick drink before dinner elsewhere, we ended up only having a few minutes to finish our drinks by the time they finally arrived, so it was disappointing to feel rushed. In conclusion- I'd recommend sketch when you want to treat yourself to a nice afternoon tea, but would probably skip the cocktail rooms.",

We got situated in the first bar though there are three total and a dining room you absolutely need a reservation for. I got the Paloma drink and my boyfriend got the Odyssey. Both drinks were delicious and the pork belly skewers were incredible. The place is super Instagram worthy and the egg pod toilets are cool. All in all, I had a great time until it was time for us to pay. When I gave the waiter my credit card, he looked at the front and back of the card (front and back with my name on it), and he asked my boyfriend to sign the receipt. I'm very disappointed with how sexist that gesture was and won't be returning.",

    "text": "After seeing this restaurant on Instagram, my girlfriend and I decided to make a reservation here a couple of days before our stay in London. Once we read reviews off here, we decided to go with Afternoon Tea at the Gallery. Visually, the space is beautiful. Upon entering, it's dark, quiet, and you'd never guess that the inside of this restaurant has whimsical themed rooms inside of it. Inside the Gallery, the walls are full of art, placed upon pink walls. Pretty much everything in the room was pink, but it wasn't anything overwhelming. The waiters and waitresses were dressed in suits and costumes while a couple of violinists played every few minutes. Of course, you'd have to visit the washroom - it'll likely be the most interesting one you'll ever visit. The ambiance of the restaurant was busy, but enjoyable. In terms of the food, it was pretty decent. We went with the cheapest option possible, giving us endless amounts of tea. We both opted for matcha and chai tea, which you can't go wrong with. What I didn't know is that if you enjoyed any of the cakes or sandwiches, you could ask for more at no cost. I was delighted to find this out because I assumed that I'd only be given the portions given initially! When looking at photos of the food from reviews, I thought I would be hungry leaving, due to the portion sizing. I can tell you that I left full, and satisfied. If you're interested in eating at Sketch, I would definitely recommended having Afternoon Tea at The Gallery. If you end up doing so, make sure you take many photos! I'm sure you'll never see anything like it again.",

We sat in the room with all the pink seats. I ordered ravioli which was lovely. My friend had tofu which was also very good. Our waiter was the quite the wine connoisseur. The restroom are a little confusing, however. Above one of the rooms is an open are for the bathrooms which are just giant pods all over. One half of the area was lit pink and the was lit blue. For some of us, this was not so noticeable. The pods were fun though, inside each pod there was rainforest music playing.A fun and swanky place. Perfect for Instagram.",

Unfortunately the evening was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.We arrived for our reservation at 10:00 p.m. and were promptly sat at our table. The server handed us our menus and said that she would be back.We wanted to start our meal with a bottle of wine which we had to wait for the sommelier to come over to actually order(mind you we already were set with what we wanted) Finally it came time to order our meals. My husband tried to order the steak and was told they were out for the evening; he proceeded to ordered the lamb, and yet again we were told they were out of it! Why was this not told to us prior to placing our order?! We definitely would have left immediately. He ended up having to order the bone marrow(not great and lacked flavor)I ordered the tortellini and was not overly impressed by the preparation of the dish(pretty Bland)The final straw of the experience at Sketch was the fact that my husband had a half glass of wine in front of him and after we were finished paying the bill the bus person took the glass away without even asking if we were finished.Sketch definitely has a lot of work to do before reaching the standards of a high end restaurant.I come to London often and will definitely not be returning to this place.Thanks for a horrible evening.",

Then we happen to be shopping in SoHo on the last day before leaving London, so I decided to try my luck again for any cancelled reservation. The host and hostess there were kind and were accommodating where possible. Second time around we were able to grab a quick bite in the forrest themed side of the cafe and really appreciate it.Sketch has two rooms, one being the renowned pink room, the other being what I call the Alice and Wonderland themed room, both are extraordinary! We visited between 3pm-5pm when they offer afternoon specials. We ordered two sets of combos, one with regular cones and the other with sandwiches. The first came with tea but the second did not. In terms of tea, we had rose and earl grey, both were phenomenal. Rose was lighter than earl grey of course, which was perfect for me since I don't usually drink tea. It was refreshing and we asked for additional hot water to reuse the paddles and tea pouch. Sandwiches were unique as well. The four sandwiches were a mix of devil's egg, smoke salmon, cucumber, and curry. The small plate was filled with delicate creativity and the taste blended well. The cone on the other hand sounded like a standard afternoon tea side but was not nearly as impressive as the sandwich to me. The cone was a bit dry, though they provide a few fruit jams to go with it. Would certainly recommend the former combo than latter here.Atmosphere and service needless to say was impeccable. Really gave us a comfortable while also classy afternoon tea feel. The pricing was also affordable in my opinion for such an experience. We paid around $50 for two people but were able to try a number of delicates while spending quantity and quality time with gourmet decoration in the view.Highly recommend for anyone!",

    "text": "11/5 dining experience. Hands down. Sketch was worth every single penny. During my recent trip to London, me and my girls knew that we had to have high tea. It was almost my birthday and my friend had recently just gotten a promotion, so we were in the mood to spend $$ and celebrate. Enter Sketch. Sketch has 5 different dining rooms, each with their own \"special\" experience and theme. Room 1: The Glade - Enchanted forest themed, specializing in lunch and cocktails. Room 2: The Gallery - Brasserie/All Pink Everything, specializing in afternoon high tea and dinner. Room 3: The Parlour, specializing in all day dining + live music and cocktails, Room 4: The Lecture Room - a Michelin star restaurant, specializing in lunch and dinner menus. Room 5: The East Bar/Pods/Bathrooms - a small modern space themed bar, also the bathrooms. We dined in Room 2: The Gallery for high tea. Immediately upon walking in you're taken aback by the beautiful pink decor and cute watercolour art on the walls. There are servers walking around in different uniforms, each with their own specific duty - \"caviar man\", \"tea expert\", and \"champagne lady\" to name a few. Our tea lady/main server came by and explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our teas to a champagne tasting, and at that point, we said \"sure, why not?\". And so we upgraded. For teas, they had a large selection of delicious teas from around the globe. Along with the champage, we each got our own pot of tea. I sampled two different ones: a Sri Lankan Earl Grey and an Indian Chai. To be honest, I can't pick between the two. Both were the best teas I've ever tried. No joke. Added a little bit of milk and sugar to them and was truly blown away. And to think this was just the teas. On to my favourite part: the food. First, we had an appetizer: sea salt and butter breadsticks with caviar and quail eggs. I have never had caviar before, but I have to say, I was impressed. I see why people eat this stuff all the time. Paired with the creamy quail egg and breadsticks, I was in foodie heaven. Second, the mains: unlimited finger sandwiches, cakes, and treats. I can't even remember everything that was there, but I do know that I love everything that I tried. My two favourites: the curried chicken sandwich and the salmon and cream cheese roll. I had to get more of these because I loved them so much. I have much more of a savoury palette than sweet, so I preferred all the sandwiches to the cakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the cakes. The blueberry cake was my favourite! At this point we were so full and we had completely forgotten that we had a third course: scones and more cakes. We all opted for the plain scones, paired with butter and your choice of strawberry or plum jam. I'm not the biggest fan of jam, so I just stuck to the good ol' butter. I wish I had more room for this because it was SO good. One of my favourite parts about this experience? The bathrooms. You go through a pair of doors and up the stairs. When you look up the ceiling is covered in neon-coloured square lights. The bathrooms itself... are eggs pods. With each egg pod being one bathroom stall. Truly one of the best (and fanciest) peeing experiences I've had to date. All in all, I loved every single minute of dining at Sketch. Everything from the attention to detail to the beautiful decor, to the delicious food and presentation to the classical band playing classic tunes, everything was absolutely perfect and now no other high tea experience will ever compare. PS: Make a reservation because this place books up months in advance!",

A friend who was meeting me there texted to ask if I was in the Alice in Wonderland room; I replied \"Honestly, I have no idea. They all look like they could be!\" The crowd seemed to be mainly art dealers and party planners, from the conversations I overheard. Certainly an interesting place to eavesdrop. I ordered a fresh grapefruit juice while I waited for my friend. The service was fine and the juice was delicious.But I have to believe the main point of Sketch is the design. Definitely worth a visit and my top tip is: find a reason to use the restroom. It might be their best room of all...",

    "text": "I had to come here after seeing gorgeous pictures of the dining hall for dinner. I made reservations online about a week before, and that whole process was super simple.The atmosphere did NOT disappoint. The dining area is every bit as magical and beautiful as social media makes it appear. Normally I wouldn't try to take pictures of a dining area, but I was giddy and I just had to! Luckily, the staff is used to this and other patrons were doing the same thing; I wasn't reprimanded for my actions. So why the three stars? The ambiance gets 5/5 stars. The food and service is three stars at best. I got peppered steak and it was super dry and tough. It did NOT taste that great. It wasn't bad, but \u00a0I was really hoping for something better. I got the mac and cheese as a side, and it wasn't terrible--just different. I liked the creamy texture, but there was some sort of curry powder in it, and it took some time to get used to. My husband got the bone marrow, and he didn't think it was great.Our server was a little odd. She forgot about us, and then she'd remember and hover--AS WE ATE. Awkward!If I could, I'd skip dinner and come here for tea. The tea is in the same area as dinner, and I'd rather have subpar tea than a supbar meal for dinner.",

In the Gallery, we had the Macaroni cheese, onion rings, sea bass, fillet steak, lamb cutlet, paired with a beautiful bottle of white wine (I forget the varietal). Food was excellent and the service was on the same level. If you're still thirsty, I highly recommend heading over to the East Bar inside Sketch. There we were welcomed by Alex who runs an awesome cocktail program. Alex prepared us a wide variety of cocktails that had our taste buds craving more. His knowledge and passion is infectious.",

So on our recently short weekend in London, we made a reservation and came here for dinner and it did not disappoint. It's very modern and lavish with a very trendy twist. When you arrive, the walls are all covered in very modern and beautiful art.If you are looking to come here, I would highly suggest you make a reservation prior to coming. We came over a weekend and reservations are super important as they were people being turned away at the door.We ate in the Gallery Room that night, which has it's high and vast ceilings in a beautiful pink, with matching furniture. The walls are covered with vibrant and witty art work- the whole ambiance is a lot of fun but still very chic. The food we ordered was delicious and there are a lot of healthy options to pick from. The menu is also very cool, it looks like a modern cullinary pop up book. Make sure you remember to order some cocktails as they are very tasty... they have a few bar areas and each room is decorated vibrantly and differently- it's a visual feast and it's no wonder Sketch has some Michelin Stars under its belt. It's a great and beautiful restaurant/ bar/ lounge / club. Before your experience at Sketch is over, be sure to stop by the bathroom- they all look like eggs. If that sounds bizarre to you, just take my word for it and go see for yourself when you have the chance to eat and drink at sketch. Can't wait for my next trip to London, Sketch will for sure be on that list of to do's!Gallery Room- Michelin *Lecture Room- Michelin **",

After one drink we were fetched to the dining room. Ordered the snails/Aubergine and some grains dish with mushrooms. The lamb cutlet and beef tartare as well. the lamb cutlet was fairly rare despite being cooked at medium. The beef tartare was basically completely bloody, but delicious. The serving for the tartare was also quite large. Overall pretty cool experience if you enjoy eating to club music.",

    "text": "1000th Review!!!!When in London we knew we wanted to do an afternoon tea, I did some research and found the cutest place and knew we had to try it! The place I found was Sketch and I couldn't wait to go.At the entrance is a hopscotch so you can hop your way in, me being uncoordinated thought it best I keep both feet on the ground lolWe walked towards the hostess desk for the Gallery to be shown to our seat, and when we walked in the gallery, I knew this was going to be a great experience, beautifully chevron floor, lush velvety pink benches and chairs, white linen tablecloths, soft pink walls, funky hand painted art on the walls, it was everything I expected it to be but so much more, and that's just from walking into the room, the experience just kept getting better.Service was impeccable, everyone looked sharp in their uniforms.We did the afternoon tea for 58 pounds. It came with unlimited choices of teas, I wish I remembered the names of the teas, but I did try a vanilla tea and Darjeeling black tea (one of my favorites). The afternoon tea comes with a lot, we started out with caviar and quail egg and cheese bread, next a beautifully presented tray came decked out with little finger sandwiches and sweets, everything was too pretty to eat, but don't worry, I did eat them. My favorites were the chicken and egg sandwiches. And we learned the sandwiches are unlimited, what? That's crazy! \u00a0Then we were treated to warm scones with fresh clotted cream and fig & strawberry jams. Is there anything better than a warm scone with fresh cream and jam? I think not! \u00a0But wait we are not done yet, but sadly we were full and asked if the dessert from the trolley could be packed up to go.Everything at Sketch exceeded my expectations, I truly was tickled pink by the entire experience. \u00a0Even the egg pod bathroom lived up to the Instagram hype.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time about a month ago.LOCATION: It's in Mayfair, which is a nice area of the city. 4/5ATMOSPHERE: The ambience is amazing. We were in The Gallery (so I can only really speak for that), which is the most famous room of theirs (they have four main rooms). There's pink furniture and decor everywhere, and interesting/cool art on the walls. It's also very clean and pristine. I love it. Also, the iconic bathroom is super cool. So if you don't know about it, check it out if you go because it is an experience -- egg-shaped toilet stalls, colorful lights -- take an iconic mirror picture. So yeah, the atmosphere is definitely supreme. 4/5SELECTION: So we went during dinner time when they serve their \"a la Carte\" menu, and not their famous afternoon tea menu. So the menu is fairly small, but I do appreciate the few labeled vegan options. However, I wish there was more, or at least a better/more unique variety, rather than a salad, a soup-type dish, and a tofu dish. Also, I was going to order the salad, but was told that I couldn't unless at least one other person ordered it too, I guess? That was a bit of a disappointment, but I dealt with the soup-type dish -- more on that below. 3/5WHAT I GOT: I got their \"Green Le Puy lentils, button mushrooms, snow peas\" dish. It was basically like a soup. It comes out as a shallow bowl of lentils, mushrooms, and peas, but then they pour some sort of broth thing over it right in front of you. It was alright overall, but definitely not anything worth raving about. I liked that it wasn't oily or salt. And, the ingredients tasted fresh and good quality. But, it was very small and not filling. They make it seem like a bigger portion by serving it in a larger looking bowl, but it's actually super shallow, so it's literally like half a cup's worth. I know it's a nice, fancy dining establishment, but it's a ripoff to pay \u00a320 for no more than like half of cup of veggies. They should at least put like some grains in it or use a deeper bowl to make it more sustaining. That's my opinion on the dish. 3/5SERVICE: The staff seemed nice, but their service was kind of awkward. First off, when I went to the front desk to say that I had a reservation, the man said to wait five minutes and then come back to ask again. I came back five minutes later and still had to wait a bit, but then we were finally seated a few minutes later. Ok, so that wasn't too bad, but then it's confusing when you're seated because you have a waiter/waitress, and then a drink person to take drink orders. But, they don't really explain that. Anyways, after figuring that out, the waitress we had would either hover around our table or disappear throughout our dinner, which was strange. Or we'd be talking about the menu and she'd keep coming over, like asking if we had questions and whatnot a bunch. On to the drinks guy: one person I was with with ordered a Pimm's. Normally, you'd expect that when you order a Pimm's, you get the drink with the Pimm's, lemonade, and fruits. However, a glass of straight Pimm's, the straight liquor, came out. We tried Googling it, and found that the only thing it could be called was a Pimm's Cup, so we looked for someone who looked like they maybe knew about drinks better, and found a young guy. After explaining the situation and the different names and all that, he seemed to understand what we were expecting because about 5-10 minutes later it finally came out as expected ... I mean, whenever I've been to pubs and whatnot in the city, there were no questions asked, and a Pimm's comes out properly, with the lemonade and fruits mixed in. Maybe we're missing something and at nicer places you have to call them Pimm's Cups? Anyways, that was our experience with the staff/service. I'd still go back for afternoon tea though. 2/5",

However, with the prices as they are that meal could be years away and I felt so strongly about the toilets I had to share this review now. I feel the same as the other reviewer here - go there for the toilets if nothing else! They are one of the most talked about points of Sketch but with good reason. I won't spoil it for you but an incredible, somewhat surreal design justifies the hype. Other quirky design features make Sketch somewhere a little bit special. If you can't quite stretch to the prices a triple michelin starred restaurant demands see if you can just grab a drink in their bar, visit an exhibition there, do something to just see the venue - its a really cool place.",

    "text": "I went here in August on a \u00a350 voucher deal through their Facebook group. The restaurant itself is an absolute experience in and of itself. We had booked our table in The Lecture Room and Library, which is the schmancy Michelin-starred restaurant. The ma\u00eetre d' gave us 'the tour' on the way upstairs \u00a0how it used to be Christian Dior's house, and all the credentials of the chef, blah blah blah. I make fun, but he was very nice, and I liked him a lot. We stop at the top of the stairs in front of two huge intimidating doors until SWOOSH, he opens them dramatically into one of the most beautiful and unique restaurant spaces I've seen. Eating at Sketch is quite the operation. And an expensive operation at that. You're looking at \u00a330 starters and \u00a350 mains. They brought out the nibbles first. There were so many! Who needs a starter anyway when you have this much?Tomato gazpacho with biscuit Little bread biscuity things with a creamy sauce Foie gras goat cheese crackers Grapefruit gummy tarts A fried little ball of somethingOh but wait! There was a proper starter too! Tuna carpaccio with a cauliflower puree and a bit of salmon roe. Yum! Again, I ask: Why would anyone pay another \u00a330 for a menu starter when I had just had enough food to pretty much fill me up for the night (bread included). On to the mains, I had the Dover Sole and Gambas. This also came with a lot of little side dishes, but for this, I have the benefit of a downloadable menu.Pan-fried Fillet of Dover Sole Meunie're Style / Cider / Green Peppercorn Gambas with Colombo Spices / Romaine Salad with Broad Beans / Bacon and Parsley Potato Mousseline / Beurre Noisette / Lemon / CroutonsThe sole was amazing. A perfect combination with the sweetness of the apple and the spice of the pepper. It was light, flavourful and perfect. The giant sectioned-off prawns that dotted the plate with lightly battered and perfectly crisp. Two sides came with \u00a0the romaine salad and potatoes. The salad was a big thumbs down. It was soggy and the lettuce was old (honestly, I saw brown edges). Just absolutely no redeeming qualities. The potatoes were whipped light as air, but the croutons and butter made it a bit too salty for my taste. While I absolutely loved my fish, I just couldn't see why the chef would choose those two side dishes to accompany. It didn't seem to click. So, even though I bulk at the main courses being so expensive, you actually are getting quite a lot of food. Five amuse bouche, a starter, a main and dessert nibbles for 40-ish pounds? Not awful. It's just when you add on the water, the cocktail, the wine, a proper proper starter and dessert that you can easily end up spending 400 quid on dinner. And that's ridiculous. If I'm going to do that, it best be at El Bulli or The Fat Duck where every single course out of, like, 30 is an experience in and of itself. Will I go back? Sure, but definitely to try the Gallery restaurant instead of the Lecture Room and Library. The latter was just way too out of my league.",

The art works dotted around the place are fantastic and you can't miss it from outside with a large white dog appearing to be morphing out of the building above the door! I spent most of my time in the round bar at the back of the venue. It's a wierd intimate space where the guests surround the circular bar. There are strange commissioned art pieces going on everywhere! There's a sound piece that disorientates in the bar and a wierd video piece in the ceiling. Nobody can go to Sketch and ignore their crazy toilets. They're giant white eggs spread out in one large room and when you've finished your business you get a little round of applause! I really enjoyed mt time here, the cocktails were great and one night when i have more time i'd like to explore it a bit more. However, the prices are a little too much but you have to expect that as soon as you walk in and see the decor and effort they've gone into to make this a unique experience. The other thing was that you get some pretentious kids in there who are obviously regulars and i'm a more down to earth pub girl but i'm so glad i've seen it and i will go back. I'd suggest arriving early evening to avoid any queues as well.",

From the decoration to the different atmsopheres it proposes, it seems you have just fallen into the rabbit hole and you'll have lots of fun finding your way out! The parlour is a lovely mix between old english style, French royal furniture and modern extravagant pieces (A painting of Mona Lisa covered with a giant Macdonald's logo, a chandelier made of desk lamps...) and offers superb food and drinks may it be for its famous afternoon tea or at night when the DJ starts to mix.Then as you enter and wonder around, you'll find a fantasist and dark small bar perfect for sharing a cocktail with a date as you watch the different lights and symbols moving on the walls. The vast all white restaurant is also quite an experience with great food and superb decor with pictures projected on the bare walls. But it does not end there! You then encounter an igloo shaped bar with the barman in the middle serving posh mixes to the happy few who got some seats around him.Then on both sides are the stairs to the most surprising toilets I've ever seen : Giant Eggs cubicles where you hear either the sound of airport announcement or birds singing.To sum up, it is hard to describe all that makes Sketch and it is worth going yourself to enjoy this adventure. I would advise arriving quite early or book a table as it becomes \"Members only\" after a certain hour.",

However this time it could not be any worse than it was. We visited on the Saturday the 10th and sat in the parlour. The moment we sat down we knew what it was going to be like...the table was dirty with ketchup stains and crumbs. Had to politely ask a very grumpy looking waitress to clean it but no one did. So i had to get up myself to ask for a tissue and give it a quick clean! Appalling! 2 cocktails took 25mins to arrive, food arrived again 25 mins later however the food itself was not that bad. But the service and atmosphere just ruined it all. No one came to our table to check if everything was ok, we were so embarrassed we decided to pay and leave not finishing our cocktails or food. To make it even worse, we had the manageress come running behind us giving out a card practically forcing us to email in about our wonderful experience she thinks we had (which by the way we noticed her doing to many other tables and constantly mentioning her name) Persuading someone to write a good review is not the way to go sketch!!! I was so ashamed as i was with my parents i just had to leave. Its a shame as our previous experience was the total opposite, i guess it all depends on which room you sit in, which shouldn't be the case.",

    "text": "What hot spot in London would you take your weekend guests fora lasting memory? At Sketch - as one of the rare exceptions inLondon - a club membership is not needed for having a goodnight out. Even first timers can expect to be greeted warmlyseveral times over by the receptionist - the front desk - thewine waiter and the table staff. Sketch is placed in Mayfair atNumber 9 Conduit Street, formerly the house of Dior. For Fridayand Saturday it is highly recommended to reserve a table a weekin advance.The Gallery, a white room with white padded sofas and ornatechairs, is one of various eating-places: there is also thecheaper Glade, the (much) more expensive Lecture Room and Caf\u00e9Parlour. Being ushered into the gallery one is surrounded by amultinational crowd (wearing avant-garde black) dining whilestill art is projected onto the walls above. The new trend ofvisual jockying (VJing) goes beyond just the eating experience.Even though Sketch presents their cuisine as French, it hasmore than a few international influences. Matching Sketch'sconcept, - the food is aesthetically pleasing and the flavoursare exotic. You eat with your eyes and the small dishes arearranged decoratively. But if Chef Pierre Gagnaires's dishesare modest in size they are not in price. \u00a0I take investors here that are thinking about investing in our fund Blue Coast AssetManagment. \u00a0I would like to say it's our distressed asset opportunities alone, but I know the secret sauce is Sketch.Imagine enjoying a fantastic dinner while the DJ puts up hiselectro beats louder, chairs and tables are taken away andfinding yourself in the middle of a dance floor. You would besurprised what interesting conversations and contacts can bemade over a Diamond Martini from the adjacent igloo formed bar.In there you hear the echo of voices and music. If the toiletsget the main part of discussion, there is something wrong withthe restaurant, but an exception has to be made: Have you everstepped into an egg shaped space ship before? They are beyondthis world (literally).The Michelin Star reflects the high concept dining; it goesinto an extravagant overdrive combining art, fashion, style andglamour. The gallery has forthcoming exhibitions. This Novemberthere is a gallery opening showing the exhibition of PatrickJolley and Oswaldo Marcia. For more information see thereferences below. Finally, let me share a secret: on your wayout, draw your attention to a piece of UV light art. Whileshaking the head and looking at it the words love appear - Whatother surprises are waiting tonight?",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this restaurant one afternoon while visiting London a few months back. There was a 30 minute wait for afternoon tea, so we decided to keep moving, and possibly comeback for dinner. We called later that night to make a reservation for dinner, but they were closed for a private event, and we proceeded to make plans for lunch the next day. When we arrived the following day for lunch, we were seated in the Parlour until our table was ready, and the staff was ready to assist. We were greeted by the maitre d' who told us that the chef would be ready shortly, and then gave us a tour of Sketch, and the history of the establishment. He led us upstairs into the Lecture Room and Library where our table awaited with a full-on french staff ready to assist. I was given a stool for my purse, and the napkins were placed in each of our laps. In the background you can hear music playing. Very similar to a finger piano, which has an almost eerie sound. We both went with the fixed lunch menu, which was three courses, plus palette cleansers, and after dinner espresso with chocolates. Overall the presentation was breath taking, and every dish was very creative. \u00a0The service was impeccable! Our pretty french waitress was on point the entire meal. She wiped every crumb from the table, and instructed us on proper consumption of the more bizarre artistic entrees. For example: when I thought I was supposed to eat some sand at the beginning of the meal that was holding thin crackers. She informed me that I should not be eating it, awesome lol... I'd also like to brag about their cheese plate selection, it was the finest I have ever seen at a restaurant. After lunch, we were allowed to explore the art studios in the back where different events are held each night. We then ventured upstairs to some crazy futuristic white bathroom pods that speak to you. This place left a lasting impression on us and what a cool city London is. We highly recommend Sketch to tourists looking for a hip place to eat lunch, dinner and afternoon tea.",

    "text": "This was a really fun and funky Afternoon Tea. \u00a0I had a few surprise visitors from home (NYC) and I wanted to make sure they didn't leave London without having afternoon tea. \u00a0I also didn't want a boring traditional afternoon tea either. \u00a0I've done the traditional swanky afternoon tea at the Ritz and I did enjoy it but its some place I'd take my mom. \u00a0This place was just what the doctor ordered. The main comment I got from my friends is that they felt like they were in Alice In Wonderland (good thing the Mad Hatter's Tea at the Sanderson was booked up). \u00a0As soon as I got there there was a doorman with tophat and I got a little nervous because of my attire (its summer and I had \"stylish\" flipflops on) but I trucked on in anyway. \u00a0My friends were waiting from me and I was immediately pleasantly surprised by my surroundings. \u00a0I passed the cafe - for the sorry sods that weren't smart enough to book - and walked into can only described as a tea room in a red forest. \u00a0the lighting was soft red and I passed some truly artistic trays of edible art. \u00a0Our party each decided to have the Afternoon Tea \u00a325 but I decided on the champagne tea which came with 1 glass of champagne (Pommery Ampanage) along with unlimited tea at \u00a346. \u00a0I don't think that is particularly worth it but the presentation of the glass of champagne was definitely something to see. \u00a0We all chose different teas so we could sample each others. Mine was jasmine, but the ladies ordered berry hibiscus, vanilla, and rose hip tea. \u00a0I liked all but the rose tea. \u00a0Now for the sweet and savoury goodies... WONDERFUL. Anyone who thinks they won't be full is terribly misguided. \u00a0We had servings for 5 people and we left with 2 beautiful takeaway boxes because we couldn't finish it all. \u00a0The Assorted finger sandwiches were smoked salmon and Jacob's cream cucumber, ricotta and asparagus, MY FAVORITE mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur, and egg and mayonnaise, quail egg, caviar were seriously tasty and is NOT your everyday egg salad sandwich. \u00a0It also came with 5 warm and buttery Sultana sconesserved with clotted cream, bitter orange and strawberry jam. All the jams and creams were so fresh I didn't care that I felt the pounds literally developing as I ate. \u00a0And finally, the edible are which were the sweets selection of pistachio macaroons, almond and berry tartlet,coffee \u00e9clair. \u00a0We ate our strawberry cheesecake in a glass because we knew we couldn't take it with us. The only thing I didn't like and its only because I am not a big marshmallow fan was the mousse malabar marshmallows which tasted like spongy chalk but again... I am NOT a fan of marshmallows and other people will probably love them. There were other sweets but honestly I can't remember the names and here's a warning: these pastries are meant to be eaten THE DAY YOU GET THEM. \u00a0Not that you'd be able to resist but as I said we were so full we had to go boxes and after tea went shopping, by the time I got home my macaroons lost their air so they shrunk and of course wasn't as pretty but just as tasty. \u00a0Our waitress was super sweet and I only have to say you have to SEE the restroom in order to believe it. The bathroom mirrors are just a small part (they say: You're beautiful and remember I'm a mirror so I can't tell a lie) of how awesome the bathroom is.I am going back there again and again again and I highly recommend.",

A bit pretentious, but that's part of the thrill, I suppose. It's less of a restaurant and more of an experience. To be honest, I can barely even remember what I had to eat. Oh, and the loo. It's quite surreal. In case you haven't heard yet, there's a large room with a bunch of white pods... women's on one side, men's on the other. After using the appropriate pod, and attendant helps wash and dry your posh pod hands.",

    "text": "Sketch is Famous French chef Pierre Gagnaire's signature restaurant in London. It actually consists for three different restaurants: Gallery, The Lecture Room and Parlour. Parlour is the more relaxed option while The Lecture Room features a tasting menu. I had the chance to eat at Gallery which is their \"middle ground\" option last weekend. Although the food didn't live up to my high expectations, I absolutely loved the experience. I had the \"Pollock\" for starters and then the scallops with truffles. \u00a0Both were good but not that original in my opinion.\"Le Citron\" dessert was excellent. And so was the Bollinger red wine selected by their high-skilled Sommelier.All in all, it was a fantastic experience for the food was good but, most importantly, service was absolutely spectacular which is a rarity when the staff is mostly French. Sketch, indeed, seems to be the exception that proves the rule in that regard. In addition, the decor of this place is just worth going there just to check it out.",

    "text": "What hot spot in London would you take your weekend guests fora lasting memory? At Sketch - as one of the rare exceptions inLondon - a club membership is not needed for having a goodnight out. Even first timers can expect to be greeted warmlyseveral times over by the receptionist - the front desk - thewine waiter and the table staff. Sketch is placed in Mayfair atNumber 9 Conduit Street, formerly the house of Dior. For Fridayand Saturday it is highly recommended to reserve a table a weekin advance.The Gallery, a white room with white padded sofas and ornatechairs, is one of various eating-places: there is also thecheaper Glade, the (much) more expensive Lecture Room and Caf\u00e9Parlour. Being ushered into the gallery one is surrounded by amultinational crowd (wearing avant-garde black) dining whilestill art is projected onto the walls above. The new trend ofvisual jockying (VJing) goes beyond just the eating experience.Even though Sketch presents their cuisine as French, it hasmore than a few international influences. Matching Sketch'sconcept, - the food is aesthetically pleasing and the flavoursare exotic. You eat with your eyes and the small dishes arearranged decoratively. But if Chef Pierre Gagnaires's dishesare modest in size they are not in price.Imagine enjoying a fantastic dinner while the DJ puts up hiselectro beats louder, chairs and tables are taken away andfinding yourself in the middle of a dance floor. You would besurprised what interesting conversations and contacts can bemade over a Diamond Martini from the adjacent igloo formed bar.In there you hear the echo of voices and music. If the toiletsget the main part of discussion, there is something wrong withthe restaurant, but an exception has to be made: Have you everstepped into an egg shaped space ship before? They are beyondthis world (literally).The Michelin Star reflects the high concept dining; it goesinto an extravagant overdrive combining art, fashion, style andglamour. The gallery has forthcoming exhibitions. This Novemberthere is a gallery opening showing the exhibition of PatrickJolley and Oswaldo Marcia. For more information see thereferences below. Finally, let me share a secret: on your wayout, draw your attention to a piece of UV light art. Whileshaking the head and looking at it the words love appear - Whatother surprises are waiting tonight?",

That's what Sketch is like. It's like Alice in Wonderland here, with chipped gold-plated cups, a trail of false blood leading you to the washrooms, and waitresses wearing brocade jackets and converse sneakers. I've had tea and lunch here, and it has been totally lovely. Service is a little uneven, and they get busy on weekends, but it's worth it. Cream tea is only ten quid, and the scones are delish. Oh, and after your meal be sure to make your way down the stairs from the main tea room to the cavernous washrooms with their blindingly white pod-like toilets. A very cool photo op indeed.",

    "text": "As someone who \"wines and dines\" my clients all over the world, I can state, without a doubt and without any bias that Sketch produced for me one of the best culinary and service experiences ... ever! This is not your standard grab a quick dinner establishment, but a highly sophisticated dining enlightenment that was truly savored over the course of almost 3 hours. \u00a0I have to pay a massive compliment to our host Sebastien, who really took us on a journey of some of the finest foods London has to offer. \u00a0Let me offer up an example of Sebastien's amazing attention to the guest as well as details. \u00a0We ordered the cheese course to start the evening (i was treating one of my best friends to a Birthday dinner), and the normal thought process would be that the restaurant brings out a cheese board with a variety of breads and spreadable flavors. \u00a0Sketch takes it to the stratosphere by rolling out 4 separate mobile cutting boards and presenting the diner with a cheese entourage from around the world. \u00a0We probably had over 40 different types of cheese to select from, and Sebastien took his time to review everyone of them. We took his suggestions (all of them) and he cut very generous pieces from each selection, and then suggested the order in which to appreciate them. \u00a0This in itself was over an hour, and the whole process was fascinating. \u00a0I cannot throw out enough positive adjectives regarding the entire dinner experience, as every course, including the artfully crafted desert, was stunning. \u00a0Now, here is where Sebastien and Sketch go over the top to secure themselves in my own personal Restaurant Hall of Fame. \u00a0Sebastien comes over to the table, asks us to put down our napkins, and follow him. \u00a0How do you not comply with this request? Sebastien walks us back to the kitchen to meet the head chef and the brigade... AWESOME! \u00a0I felt like we were walking the Hall of Honors, and the Chef could not have been more gracious to us. \u00a0How was the rest of the service? As outstanding as it could possibly be. \u00a0From the gentleman pouring the water, to the waiter who refilled the bread and to the management that checked on us, as well as gave us a tour of the entire complex, we felt like the red carpet was specially rolled out for a personal experience unlike any other. \u00a0I cannot wait until my next trip to the UK, and the number one stop on my list the next time, and every visit thereafter, will be Sketch London.",

I knew if I wanted the Afternoon Tea on a Saturday I'd have to book, originally I was going to call just to enquire. I called up and the gentleman (because he was ever so polite, so I'm not gonna call him a 'dude') asked me what I was booking for. I mentioned it was a surprise for my friends birthday. So he said rather than just booking for the Parlour he'd reserve me a table at the Glade, which he said would be 'nicer'.On arrival there was quite a queue, but thankfully got to bypass it all to be taken to our table. Coming from a Theatre Design background I was in complete awe of my surroundings. The quirky sculptures we passed on our way to the Glade. Totally geeked out over how visually stimulating it was. If you've visited their website and loved the quirk, the place itself will not disappoint. On to the good stuff. Everything that comes with the afternoon tea looks exquisite and tastes absolutely incredible. THE BEST AFTERNOON TEA EVER. Every single thing that I ate was pretty much orgasmic. YEAP. THAT GOOD. This is fine dining at its best. I can't say any more than it was the best, the best, the best. N.B: I've kept this short (for me) because I cannot recommend it anymore, other than saying if you don't try it I may have to slap you with a giant wet fish!",

A tomato salad with a jelly balsamic, jelly with salad... really? It didn't work and I think the chef was just trying to be too fancy. Why not slosh some good quality balsamic onto those quality tomatoes and let the natural flavour shine through... hmmm.My second course was halibut, delicious cut of fish cooked perfectly- but with potato foam?!? Why foam when you could just have it with some great tasting Charlotte potatoes? An experience but certainly not one I'll be going back for... overpriced, over fancy, not my thang.",

There are three bar areas- one in the front, the pod, space like one in the back and the other one that is hard to explain but that we spent the most time in. The walls are red with laser lights shining on them and crystal sparkles dotting the walls. There is a huge branch like decoration hanging from the ceiling and small tables scattered about. It was almost garish when we walked in but got better when the lights were dimmed a bit.The drinks are not for the \"faint of wallet\". Their speciality cocktail list starts at 13 pounds per drink and have names so odd I cannot remember one but are interesting concoctions. At the end of the day- I still prefer my old stand bys.Service was almost nonexistent for a private club- they easily could have served us three drinks in the span of time that we were there yet we only were able to get one. And all of our glasses were empty for quite some time. The dining room in the back doesn't open until 9 but it's almost impossible to get a reservation there as the members have it all booked up. \u00a0I wish I had made it to the restrooms reading these other reviews (and the manager told us about them the second we walked in) but we were running short on time.Take a gander at some of the wild art that they have around this place. The copulating greyhounds statue (so much detail) and the technology tree (all sorts of gadgets) come to mind as two things you won't miss if you walk in the place. All in all- a bit much for me but given the crowd there on the night we were there . .it seems to have a loyal following.",

Regardless of the strange decor though, I have to give this place at least 4 stars for the cocktails. AMAZING. The rosemary martini was probably the best drink I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of drinks...). They have a pretty extensive list and everything we tried was delicious. The drinks were surprisingly even worth the 13 pounds that they cost.The bathrooms are absolutely bizarre. You walk upstairs to a group of egg-shaped pods. Each \"pod\" played different music and/or sounds. One of my friends said that her bathroom had barn animal noises. Points for originality?",

    "text": "I love writing reviews, but there are times where I really don't want to write the review because I really want things to be better than they were. Sketch is one of those places.Four of us went here to dine in the Lecture Room (Nava, Andrew, me and my other half). I was really excited. Nava had a \u00a350 promotional code! My parents got my other half a \u00a3100 gift voucher! I was ready to have some fun and a good meal.Unfortunately, several things went majorly wrong. It started out okay. We met in the Parlour room for drinks. The drinks were nice, if not a bit strange. They took us upstairs to the lounge in the Lecture room to wait for our drinks. My rosemary martini tasted nothing like rosemary nor a martini. Reading the ingredients, it was expected, but still, rosemary would be nice. The other half wanted another cocktail, so the waiter brought him the cocktail menu (for the Lecture Room). There weren't many and they were way too expensive. It was close to \u00a350 for an old fashioned, and while it was with really rare bourbon, it seemed a bit too expensive. So the other half asked if he could order a drink from downstairs. He was told no. He was told he could go downstairs and get one, but they wouldn't make one upstairs nor bring it up for him. (Annoying). He went downstairs. The maitre d' saw him going downstairs. He was with other people, but eventually caught up and told him that they would take the drink to him upstairs. And they comped him because he should never have been told to go downstairs and get it. The comp was nice, but it was annoying he had to go down and ask for it in the first place.At the table, we were told we couldn't use both the voucher and the promo code. Which made no sense. A voucher is money they already have. It's not like we were trying to use 3 promo codes or anything. Nava agreed that we could use ours. My other half had to talk to them at the end of the meal. The manager agreed that we could use both, obviously, but the fact we had to actually discuss it with them was annoying. (The trend here is annoying, in case you haven't noticed.)The food was actually pretty good. Most of it. However, they left the plastic backing on part of my food, which I had to eat around. Really two-Michelin star restaurant? Plastic? I also had a bone or plastic in my fish as well. Two courses in a row? It's annoying (and puzzling). The chicken curry was fantastic. They really enjoy giving you two or three dishes at once. (Or in the case of dessert, SIX. Yes we had six different tiny plates surrounding each of us. My other half was overwhelmed and felt rushed to eat it because it was all there at once.) And they liked to whisk the plates away at random times. I'm used to dining in the UK where they take plates away all at once, but the constant whisking away of plates was a bit unnerving. The hot chocolate was good, very good. Not the best I've ever had to be honest. Given that good chocolate is fairly new to the UK, I can understand why people would think it's the best. I'd have it again to be sure, but I've had far better in the States. The seaweed butter was to die for though. I've never had it, and I kind of fell in love with it. We ran out early, and had to ask for more. Irritatingly. We were almost out of butter and they kept bringing us bread. It's not hard to notice that more butter was required.The wine. It was really good. So good we do what we often do and see if we can find it to have at home (because wine at home is usually about half the price. There's a markup, I get it, I don't mind paying double for a bottle when you're at a restaurant). We couldn't find it anywhere in the UK, but they were about \u20ac15 a bottle on the mainland. Now I'm pretty good at math, but you don't really need to be great to figure out prices. I know it's more expensive for booze in the UK (thank you taxes), so \u20ac15 a bottle equates to about \u00a325-30 a bottle in shops in the UK. Now double that, it's pretty standard at a restaurant. That's about \u00a350-60 a bottle if you're out. Now these wines were about \u00a375-90 a bottle. That's a triple markup. I shouldn't be surprised since they were selling glasses of Balfour sparkling wine for \u00a330 a glass. I can get it at home for about \u00a340 a bottle. Do the math. Six times \u00a340 is \u00a3240 pounds. That's way more than a triple markup. Triple markups are a bit too much for my liking.The decor is pretty fab though. All the rooms are decorated differently and you can tell they spent a lot of work making it look the way it does. The big cushy seats in the Lecture room were also great for eating dinner in!So overall, I had a good time, the food was good. The service needed a lot of work (so very surprised with the two-Michelin star rating). It seemed the servers needed a lot more training to understand what Michelin star service should entail. I'm probably not going back when there are lots of other places to try and since I wasn't wowed by my experience, I'll be moving on.",

    "text": "I've been dying to go to this place for ages, mainly for the bathrooms that everyone keeps raving about. What finally got me here was it being the 1st stop of the Mayfair chocolate tour as Sketch is reputed to have the best hot chocolate in London.Verdict? Yep definitely some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had, and by far the best in London. It's rich, creamy, full of deep chocolate flavour, but light enough not to weigh you down. It comes in posh porcelain tea cups which is a little odd as I consider hot chocolate best served in a mug with little marshmellows but then again that's usually when made at home or around a fire.The bathrooms are just hilarious, and fittingly odd for the place. To put into context, you first walk up a short flight of stairs and in front of you is a beam of light which changes colour periodically. Cool but nothing special until you turn your head away from it and a word flashes out at you from the corner of your eye. It's almost as if you are seeing things but it is just a strange optical illusion definitely sets the scene. The sculputures around the restaurant, cafe, and club areas are a bit disturbing and what I imagine the artwork of Chucky to be like. My favourity was the slim female figure in an almost Thinker pose with a big afro. Which wouldn't be that unusual until you realise that the \"afro\" is made up of hundreds of syringes stuck needle first into the head of the figure.There is a Michelin starred restaurant above (didn't make it there, but planning on it soon!) and a large open room that you can easily see being a dance floor at night. The room is ringed with projectors that can cover all four walls with pictures and movies although in this dark open space with white couches, the only playing was a indie art flick that I could only describe as the lovechild of the Ring and The Twilight Zone. Needless to say I didn't linger in this room and rushed to the bathrooms just next door. The bathroom area is actually above a sunken spherical bar and boys go left while girls go right but a curving white staircase. In contrast to the room of horrors of a club, this is pure dazzling white. You pick an egg, cocoon yourself in side, and go about your business. Oh and don't be scared if you hear voices...everyone does.Overall, loved the unique atmosphere that Sketch delivers and just walking around is a rush. Tracy L and I have decided it's a must for a night clubbing and then perhaps a posh dinner.",

    "text": "Cathy and I dined here twice, once for afternoon tea and cakes back in September, and once for supper in April. Let me say this much - the place is very large, with different rooms with different themes, and so much to look at that it borders on the distracting (but in a decidedly good way). First, I'll say the one bad spot regarding Sketch ... the service is a little erratic, and sometimes takes a while to get noticed if you're drink is needing replacing or you need extra attention to your meal. \u00a0That being said, let me move onto what I can describe as the magic of Sketch!We got seated proper at 8.30 on a busy Saturday evening in the Gallery Room, and the maitre-d was an incredibly charming French gentleman who said everything with a insouciant flourish of his well-manicured hands and his impeccable smile. A giant lamp made out of children's toys and action-figures and dolls painted entirely white is by the entrance. Near the coat-check is a porcelain statue of two mating greyhounds. In the entrance is a hopscotch painting in the floor, and one of the doors off to the left appears to be melting, cascading thick red resin down a petite flight of stairs. Outside is a merry-go-round of \"out of work\" ashtrays that spins and empties themselves into a urn. Cathy and I were seated next to a softly lit wall set in the centre of the room that was impaled with chairs, pieces of antique tables and chandeliers, and one of the first things we noticed was the projections of the Paris skyline rotating slowly on the upper parts of the walls. A DJ was spinning some wicked house music with a lot of bass, and everybody was beautiful.We ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliqot, which arrived quickly, and received two little shot glasses of a vegetable puree which was then poured over a little shaving of raw tuna with something that resemble lentils. Cathy's entree was a little radicchio salad with slices of Chilean Sea Bass and a balsamic vinaigrette, I went for more of the tuna!Main courses came a bit later. I dropped a knife once and a server caught it as it bounced off the floor, and immediately replaced it. Good reflexes! I had a rib-eye steak bloody with dauphinois potatoes and leeks, whilst Cathy had a fish dish I can't remember.After we had this blowout piece of lovely hot chocolate cake, I took off to the toilets. All I can say is ... WOW. You go through a door in the back and you see in the centre of this massive room a small dugout bar surrounded by two semi-spiraling staircases that envelope the bar as they go to the next level. One is back-lit blue for the boy's toilets, and the other one is pink. You ascend the staircase, and come across these pods that look like escape pods mated with the transportation pods from \"The Fly\" and the eggs from \"Alien\". The door opens with a gentle hiss, and closes behind you. Everything is bathed in a soft blue (or pink if you're a girl) light, and gentle soaring sounds surround you as you complete your business.I recommend saving some space in your evening for a last glass of champagne in the little dugout bar when you've finished with your meal. \u00a0It's rather small, and looks like something out of \"Star Wars\". The gently domed ceiling is covered with little sketches, the bartenders were friendly, and a single portal in the centre gives way to the blue/pink lights from up above near the pod toilets.A very interesting, fun, and fabulous evening, I highly recommend it!",

With projection lights placed strategically across the dinner hall patterns evolve throughout the wall and ceiling space to create texture played with colour. Along with the music this movement is so catchy and surprisingly not distracting.

The service was impeccable, the food is mediocre. we went to a couple of the bars afterwards and we were not dissappointed but the bar tenders were only okay and the drinks were again pricey. I would come again for a treat because its different. Also its a great spot to people watch",

The drinks were pretty delish and very fancy schmancy. In fact the whole flashy moves by the bartenders by the bartenders kinda turned me off. Just fix the drink! But, hey everybody else seemed to like it. So what do I know. The other thing that turned me off and away from drinking more than I would have liked was the price. YEOUCH! Sketch ain't cheap. Most cocktails were well over ten quid. I guess that's to be expected in such a happening Mayfair spot but I had to mention it.",

There is a bit of fusion going on with the food, but it's all worth a try (adds a bit of excitement to your meal).

On the downside, there was a medium sized queue to be seated, but that was cunningly managed by my friends running characteristically late, and myself early. So I got to enjoy the entrance hall for a good 15 minutes on my own. The plus side is that once you're seated, the service is good, the food is cute and light and tasty and you are not remotely rushed to give up your table to the next person who has been stood outside for quarter of an hour. I will return. Too fussy for parents, but perfect for gossiping with girl friends.",

I managed to snag a last minute reservation in the pink room.The decor, in all pink, plush, and gold, made the experience unique and whimsical. The staff were all polite and friendly. Once we were seated, we were greeted by the Champagne Popper [yes a person who's sole role was to pop open bottles of champagne!] who sold us on ordering their Rose. His recommendation was solid and we enjoyed it [despite the price tag on just the one glass]. Then we had the caviar guy come over in his full pink velvet suit with a top hat! And after him, our tea master came over to introduce herself and offer recommendations and answer any tea related questions. Finally our finger sandwiches came out and we put in our orders of teas.I tried several different pots of teas and I became full despite barely touching the sandwiches and cakes. And of course, took several trips to the restroom to experience the pods! Overall, the entire time at the Sketch was an experience from beginning to end. They also had a trio of violinists playing as we had our meal!",

It comes with layers of assortment of goodies from macarons, chocolates, meringues, and finger sandwiches and much more. \u00a0Quail egg finger sandwiches were to die for! Had couple refills, which is complementary along with the tea. \u00a0I ordered the blackberry herb tea and the color and taste was just so me, pink! I adored this place! \u00a0This was my last stop during our 6 hour crammed day trip in London and it was one of the best part of the day! Not to mention that my online reservations weren't showing up in their system... I was literally about to have a fit if we weren't able to experience it. Luckily one of the host sat us, during the reservation chaos while the other host was asking me to scrimmage through my email to find the confirmation on my almost battery drained, dying phone with bad data connection. For this I couldn't give this place 5 stars. \u00a0Some staff were a bit too snobbish for their own good, including our server... \u00a0Lighten up, maybe they need a tea break as well. \u00a0Do visit the bathroom during your visit. \u00a0It's pretty fascinating and bizzard that people are taking pictures in front of the bathroom. \u00a0Guilty of taking pics as well, bathroom is pretty unique with their individual white egg pods that simulate wilderness sounds that reminds you of being in jurassic park museum before things went sour. \u00a0But in the end, it's a fancy porter potty!Oh, and be ready to cough up some $$~Wasn't friendly on your wallet, but will always remember this visit!

We we're seated by the bar, and they didn't care about our dress code that much, of course, try to dress nice to fit in. Plastered in square \"sketches\" all over their pink, very dim room with lounge-esque tables and chairs and a bar (we sat at the bar) It's a lot to take in. We tried to read as much of the sketches/cartoons as possible. People literally come for egg pod toilets. Unisex and elevated on another level by the stair case, this place takes a bathroom experience to a whole new futuristic level. The elevated level felt like a nest for these eggs. I had some risotto that was covered in green sauce and mustard ice cream for dessert. All the flavors are dynamic and interesting. Not something you would find anywhere else. For a trial run, I would highly recommend this place, but honestly, the food palette surprised me so much and I didn't love the food. Maybe come for brunch or cocktails at night to take in this places interior designs.",

    "text": "This review is for the Lecture Room at dinnertime with the tasting menu and vegetarian tasting menu: I recently visited The Lecture Room with my boyfriend for a nice dinner while on holiday. Making a reservation was easy. I did mine online, got an email confirmation, and then also a phone confirmation the day before. Upon arrival, we were greeted outside of Sketch by a very polite gentleman who showed us inside. We asked to have a drink at the bar because we were early for our reservation. I had the Cable Car (I think that's what it was called) and it was delicious. It smelt strange because of the egg, but it was quite tasty and very flavorful. After I finished my drink, we went back out into the main hallway and were escorted through a roped off set of stairs up to the restaurant. The door was opened for us and our chairs pushed in at the table. We were seated in the room closest to the street. The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the ambiance was nice. It was quiet and nobody was ever very loud. I did feel like I had to speak more softly than normal, despite the distance across from my boyfriend being rather wide. I ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, while my boyfriend ordered the regular tasting menu. Both had the same amount of courses and the same timing, although mine was about 20-30 pounds cheaper. We were offered champagne but we declined. This was our first ever Michelin experience and we were very excited to start trying the food. Each course was mostly timed well. It gave us time to digest in between, although toward the end we were so full it became hard to finish the courses. Rather than go through every course we had, I'll just speak in generalities. Before eating, I had expected that this would be one of the most flavorful and best meals of my life. \u00a0While the courses were indeed flavorful, none of them blew my mind. I hardly do fine dining, but I can still recognize amazing flavors and great taste. Most of the courses were good, but again, not life changing. My favorites were the asparagus ice cream/soup dish, goat cheese ravioli, strawberry dessert, and chocolate mousse (not sure what all was in it) dessert. My least favorite was the very dry pancake. All in all, I would rate the food about a 7/10 in taste, 8/10 in unique combinations and flavors, and 9/10 in presentation. Service-wise, everything was great for the first 2.5 hours. Our waters were always filled (not free water btw), napkins folded when we left the table, doors opened for us on the way to the bathroom, courses explained (sometimes hard to understand the thinker French accents), and chairs pushed in for us. Around the 3 hour mark, our service began to decline. Some of the people who arrived after us and were on the same eating pace as us began getting their courses ahead of us. We waited quite a long time between the last course, the desserts, and the petit fours. Also, after we were clearly finished with the final petit fours, we sat around and waited for 30-40 minutes to get our check. That really was the worst part of the evening, as it was nearing midnight and we were ready to leave. It's like everyone just checked out and forgot about us. We were the last to leave in our room, despite having finished our food at the same time as everyone else. \u00a0Service for the first 60% of the dinner: 10/10. Service for the last 40%: 6/10. Should have been amazing the entire time. The food was good, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't go again because nothing was very memorable or mind blowing as I had expected. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Michelin experience, but I just wouldn't spend the money to eat here again. Overall, the experience was great and the food was sufficient.",

    "text": "***FOR AFTERNOON TEA ONLY***I had heard of Sketch many times before, primarily for their different designed rooms. So having scheduled to be in London for only 24-hours on my recent trip, I made the effort to book reservations at Sketch for quintessential afternoon tea. I made reservations online approximately three weeks in advanced and easily booked the designated time I had wanted for the Gallery (the pink room). Afternoon Tea is preset for person at \u00a336. It includes sandwiches, scones, and desserts, at minimum one piece of each item on the menu for the number of people at the table, and a pot tea of your choice. Any additional cocktails or champagne is outside of the set price.Don't under estimate the sandwiches and desserts! It's all very filling! The pesto panini is the only warm sandwich on the menu, so it's suggested that you eat it first. Service is oddly quick. The scones are wonderfully crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The earl grey macarons are great too. My favorite sandwiches were the panini and the salmon with cream. If you happen to like more than the rest, you can ask for more! We sure did with the panini sandwiches. For anyone booking late in the afternoon, tables have to be returned by 18:00. I had reserved a table for 16:30 and the hour and a half was easily enough time. Beware - there is a cancellation fee if you don't show up! Its just as much as afternoon tea per person(\u00a330)!!!",

Also, when they \"offer\" you bread and olives, SAY NO!!!!!! THEY CHARGE YOU NEARLY $7 FOR EACH! Place is quite awful. Would never recommend to anyone, especially for this kind of price. It also attracts an older, not very trendy crowd, so if you're looking for that definitely do not come here. At lease the bathrooms were cool.",

We didn't have the reservation and it was a rather busy day when we walked in since it was a post-Valentine's Day. People who didn't get the reservation on V-day flushed in the day after. But the waitress managed to give us the best seats at the bar which gave us the view of the entire restaurant. The cocktails are great. The bartender definitely knows what he's doing. Even we were sitting at the bar, they still gave us sufficient attention to make our experience wonderful. Also, the bathroom is worth checking out. The entire building has this \"Alice in the Wonderland\" vibe. Each room looks different and very heavily themed. The Sketch is like the tea party and the bar across it is like the tree hole that Alice falls in. Unfortunately, we missed the tea time this time, but I would love to come back and try their afternoon tea.",

But my favorite part was going back to The Glade Room for our afternoon tea. There's a really nice ambiance about that room in particular and the hues of greens and yellows with the bamboo styled furniture are all really nice.The selection of beautifully made cakes and savories were just as good, if not better than the first time I came. They were displayed on a lovely stand with a mousse and macaroons at the top, some more sweets in the middle, and with things like egg, cress and caviar topped sandwiches at the bottom of the stand. The tea and cocktail menu is also really well put together their gin and tonics are really on point too.This is a great treat if you want to surprise a loved one, or are in London and want something a bit traditional, yet wacky to do.",

I give the atmosphere 5 stars and the food alone 4 stars, because it is good but not as amazing as the atmosphere sets you up to expect.

You must walk through the restaurant where you can see great sketch artwork on the walls on your way to the bathrooms which are out of this world. You just have to see it to believe it.

The dinner food was absolutely horrendous (got this weird miso noodle dish), and the waitress got our drink order wrong because she did not speak proper English. The breakfast was good, just got porridge (how can you muck that up?), so I would recommend Sketch only for breakfast.

You would imagine a layered piece of heaven, treating all the ingredients, especially a delicacy like foie gras, with all the necessary respect. Far off! What I got was an undefined roundshaped \"mash\" of pork and foie gras on a bed of blended black pudding (attempt to make a sauce?) that tasted to undefineable that I forgot what it was supposed to be at the time.One word: YUCK! The ingredients were mashed together with disrespect, it tasted like old greasy slime and unfortunately there wasn't even any texture or crunch from the \"suckling pig\".I have never been so disappointed by a dish with some of my favorite ingredients.The final reason why I will definitely never come back to sketch: not only was the dish disgusting, it also gave me food poisoning.",

I had taken my 7.5month old baby along as reviews seemed to indicate the place is surprisingly baby friendly. And I must say, I was pleased with the promptness with which they brought the high chair out... I had a pot of the Puerh tea to start with, as it was a nippy day and I wanted something to warm me...the tea and the presentation were both lovely. I placed an order for their poached eggs, with crab and cereliac remoulade and toasted brioche. The eggs were just right and the remoulade was an unusual take on the traditional breakfast. But, I definitely felt the portion size was a tad on the smaller side, which is why I placed an additional order for wholemeal toast after the eggs arrived. Really liked the spreads to go with the toast. And can't fault the latte afterwards either. However, I feel like this may not be the best fare on offer at sketch.... I looked around and saw a party enjoying their afternoon tea and thought, I must come back to enjoy some of that. Also, I had a peek at their various other rooms including the plush Gallery, I made furious mental notes on where to book for my next meal here... this time, it was an A-OK meal, but next time, I suspect it'll be better!PS - Also, my experience of the place may have been coloured by the company... when you have a group of 6 who have placed more or less similar orders, just split the bill equally. I mean, really. Stop tallying up the individual items you ate...especially if you have so much freaking cash to eat here in the first place. And especially if the final sum you pay is more or less similar to everyone else's...this is a pet peeve, clearly.",

I would say the place is a bit pricey for afternoon tea, but for the experience is definitely worth the money! Forgot to mention, their toilet is so pretty and fancy! \u00a0I LOVE IT! So, overall, Sketch is definitely an experience!",

    "text": "Afternoon tea at Sketch is a sight to behold. The room alone is breathtaking. We were greeted with a saucer of champagne, which was soon followed by the afternoon tea. The sandwiches were unlimited and personally, my favourite part of the meal. The tiers were followed by warm scones and more tea. An amazing experience, by far the best afternoon tea I have had. The service was impeccable. The knowledge provided by the waitress was fantastic. The atmosphere was great and the interior is stunning. The bathroom is out-of-this world- like something from Alien! Each cubicle is an egg.My only criticism would be that they try and convince you to order more champagne again and again, as this is obviously not included in the \u00a365 afternoon tea price.",

Carve out a whole afternoon for this experience! The decor, fashion , dishes, staff, music are all inspiring and creative. Don't miss out on using their restrooms! It was an out of this world experience that I can only liken unto a more sophisticated Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but that totally doesn't do it justice.",

    "text": "Sketch is more of an experience than just food!:) I have been a few times and I love to take visiting friends here because they always enjoy the quirky, fun vibe here. It has a few different rooms to eat in, I have only been to The Parlour (because the others are even more pricy). The Parlour is wonderful, no two sofas match, and everything inside is an eclectic, bohemian collection of furniture. Everything is pretty to look and rather interesting to check out. Everytime I go I'm greeted by a hopscotch game chalked onto the floor, which I always use when I think no one is looking:P I never leave without making sure my visitor has seen the bathrooms here, because they are really fun. One is covered in swarovski crystals (even the flush is a crystal you push), and on the way there you pass a statue of a sitting woman completely made of crystals. The second bathrooms is even more fun. When I walked in, my first impression was of a blindingly white space filled with egg pods and odd noises. It is a bit disorienting to realize that each egg pod is a bathroom. The atmosphere is really different than any other bathroom I've been to, and the first time I went I was greeted by the sight of a girl dressed as a Victorian maid scrubbing the shiny white steps for all she was worth, and I wondered for a mad moment if I had been transported to a Victorian futuristic alternate universe. If I was coming for the first time, I wouldn't leave without going here, and hoping to see the cleaner lol.The decor changes everytime a little, and I'm sure it is different for everybody. My favorite time was the first time because to get to the bathroom i had to pass through a room that was dim and had a video projected on all the walls of someone climbing trees with the loud and creepy sounds of the rustling trees and people. I was expecting lunch, not art, and the surprise was really fun.Speaking of the lunch, the menu changes everytime I go as well. The first time I went I had the high tea, which was wonderful. They had the loveliest, fragrant jasmine green tea served in pretty tea cups, and a hazelnut chocolate cake that my husband and I fought over because it was so good. The next time i went, the cake was gone and the other desserts though decent, were not quite at that level. Another time we tried the lunch and I had tiny black sandwiches which were quite fun although not that yummy. The food there is unpredictable, I have had one or two really yummy things, and otherwise decent if unremarkable food, but never anything terrible. I love the atmosphere and would recommend it to someone who wants something different and fun with a cup of really good tea:)",

It's truly a piece of art.If you ever find yourself in London, I highly recommend a visit! I had a Pureh tea (still not actually sure how to pronounce that) called \"vintage mini cakes\" with two authentic English scones (side note: they're pronounced \"scons\" apparently) with clotted cream and jam. For a couple of hours, I felt like a true Londoner.Service was amazing, as was the tea and the tea room. Come for an hour or 3 for an eclectic twist on a traditional British pastime.",

All good. \u00a0You've also got a variety of cakes they bring out... probably had my week's worth of sugar in that meal but all worth trying out. \u00a0Their finger sandwiches are very unique - for example their egg sandwich had a very small sunny side up egg on each sandwich. Nice attention to detail. \u00a0The scones were available afterwards (not much space on the table as there were 3 of us) and they came out warm with jam and clotted cream. Very tasty and above average for the food tasted.I would expect paying close to 30 quid for tea the service would be exceptional. \u00a0If I compare to other Afternoon Tea establishments for at other luxury hotels for roughly the same price the service is sub-par. \u00a0For example, tea was provided but not poured. We had to ask for sandwich refills rather than just being brought them. \u00a0These are the tiny things I'd expect. The staff, however, was nice friendly and we had a good meal.",

    "text": "What a delightful little surprise with such exquisite, with very well thought out interior decor. FYI I'm only reviewing about the afternoon experience I had here.Mixing heritage with a modern twist, the hip and artistic atmosphere here is great for birthday tea as well as small friends gatherings. Downtown romance with uptown dining experience, the \u00a332 tea set was pleasant, though not a full on 100% of what I expected- a mediocre scone with 2 jams, around 3 slices of finger sandwiches, one tiny macaron, pistachio mousse, a tiny chocolate eclair, two bite size caramel chocolate candy (so DELISH btw), lime and raspberry tarts, and three marshmallows (lemon, lavender and rose). and of course, a pot of tea that comes out to around 2 cups. The tea sets weren't meant to be shared, meaning that's ALL yours. Also ordered an extra earl gray macaron and this raspberry rose macaron base tart (the one with full on rose pedals on top). Do recommend this over that puny droplet of earl gray macaron although the earl gray flavor was a nice touch in variety.Overall, very satisfied with my experience at this posh and chic place, a little pricey, but consider it worth it regarding all other aspects!",

I would recommend doing that if you don't have a reservation, want a cheaper meal but still want to try out sketch, and if you want to see the bathrooms (opens after 12).I had the poached eggs with asparagus cream and the 3 mini desserts with a pot of tea. The eggs were okay...kind of bland. The desserts were very tasty and if I were to do it again, I would come only for desserts and tea (10\u00a3) and eat lunch elsewhere.Service was so attentive, despite the fact that some guests near me were so rude and entitled to the staff. The guest next to me even took off her shoes and stood on the chairs to take a photo...not what I expected in the middle of a nice restaurant.Overall, I really think it is worth trying out but the food is overpriced and not that great.",

The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere -- it sort of feels like you're in some kind of Alice in Wonderland movie with a sort of wild regal air. I ordered the traditional risotto with parmesan, creamed spinach, and a cocktail. Unfortunately I forget the name of the cocktail but it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. However, it was also one of the most expensive ones too, around 20 USD for a single cocktail. The risotto and the creamed spinach were amazing. The risotto's texture was perfect with the rice having just a little bit of bite and the richness was surprising; the dish was rather small but I was completely full afterwards. The creamed spinach was buttery smooth and delicious and lended a really good complement to the risotto.Delicious food with a unique atmosphere but a pretty hefty price.",

    "text": "The atmosphere of Sketch is really breathtaking. My first initial thought when I walked into Sketch was: Wow, this place is huge! There are three rooms from what I saw when I walked into the doors: them being, the Gallery, The Parlour, and The Glade. The Gallery is where you can order \u00e0 la Carte, desserts, and its famous afternoon tea sets. The Parlour and The Glade are where breakfast and brunch are served. Even though Sketch is famous for its afternoon tea, I actually did not reserve seats to try the afternoon tea, but to try their brunch. Surprisingly, it was really tasty. When my friend and I looked at the menu, there were so many options and we wanted to try all of them because they all sound so good; however, of course we did not do so. We ended up ordering two main plates and one dessert: fish pie n\u00eemoise (\u00a317.00), grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce (\u00a321.00), and a victoria sponge cake (\u00a36.00). The fish in the fish pie n\u00eemoise was salmon and I thought the texture was kind of funny and interesting, but the dish was delicious! The salmon of the grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce dish was super juicy and well cooked. The dish I actually loved the most out of the three is actually the victoria sponge cake. It has raspberry jam and a few raspberries on the top of the sponge cake and a vanilla chantilly layer in between the sponge cakes. When I bit into it, I did not know what to expect because I was not too fond of raspberries. However, after trying that dessert, I immediately change my opinion on raspberries and I quite like them now. A downside of this restaurant is the service. Even though there were a lot of servers, we still had a hard time calling for them and had to do it a couple of times before they would come and take our order. However, the food came quickly, which makes the wait more bearable. Some may think that Sketch is too overpriced, but to me, I think these prices are inexpensive for the magnificent quality of food the restaurant serves.",

    "text": "I love this place so much - not because of the food, which is actually quite good, but because the wildly varying degrees of decor in the entire place just tickle my fancy so much. There's the main tea parlor, enrobed in rose petal pink, whose chairs look like ladyfingers and where you feel positively doted upon by all the servers. While you wait for your seat, you might have a drink at the spherical bar in the back, where seating goes around the perimeter and the ceiling is decorated with unconventional drawings. Their cocktails are good and not overly strong. The famous space-age egg bathrooms are above, and when you use one, a recording of a 1940s pilot speaking on the radio crackles through hidden speakers. Then you have the Glade, personally my favorite room, decorated like a woodland fairytale as if straight out of a Lorrain landscape. And upstairs, you find the trippy disco bathrooms that fascinate me even more than the egg bathrooms - a small, dark room filled with flashing, twinkling, revolving lights, accompanied with similarly twinkling music, that make you feel like you just walked into an acid trip. No matter what room you're in, you can be sure it'll be thoroughly decorated and every detail thought of.You might think all the excess in decor is there to mask subpar food, but the thing is, afternoon tea more than holds its own here. For two people, you get a large three-tiered stand filled with delicate tea sandwiches of different flavors and several desserts as well. Is it the best food you've ever had? Resounding no, but it's still much better than you might expect for such an outwardly flashy place. When you finally stagger out, stuffed more than you thought possible from just a couple of tiny sandwiches and and tea, you'll come away with the sense of having had an experience you won't really find anywhere else.",

The bathrooms are extremely unique seeing is believing! Everything is very 60s Barbarella style! I only saw three of the rooms, but it all seems to be in good fun!

Be prepared to run into people having full on photo sessions in the open space pod bathroom. The hosts were beautifully decked out, as if straight from a photo shoot, and our server was so sweet and helpful. Our entire tea time reservation was a well-timed performance, but we were not complaining. Loved the live orchestral quartet playing in the main gallery.While the food and service were hands down a 5 star service, the food itself was merely 4 stars. Our afternoon tea service offered endless variety of teas, scones, sandwiches, and cakes, but we were honestly too stuffed to even order more! It's a ton of food, which is good considering the price point. The desserts were mostly very good, but the sandwiches themselves were a bit bland. I suppose tea sandwiches are not that exceptional to begin with, but we found them to be just okay.A very enjoyable experience nonetheless. I'd advise you to dress to impress as pictures will be taken! Now, if only we had run into Wes Anderson and Bill Murray on the way out ...",

    "text": "Yes!Decadence, thy name is Sketch. This place is pop art, at a Mad Hatter's Tea Party in a wonderland of All The Whimsy. There are servers in silk dresses, maids in French outfits, tea masters, and a caviar man in a pink suit from the set of Great Expectations. Decor: We sat in the gallery; gold, pink, plush everything. The 'great room' of the establishment, with a bar of gilded gold, rose gold copper countertops and backsplash. Pink velour and leather seats. The gallery's perimeter walls are lined with whimsical and random black and white sketches. There is a trio, \u00a0or quintet (who counted?) playing Satie, and vaguely familiar music from car commercials and films. The parlour next door is another room from Alice in Wonderland. The walls are trees papier mach\u00e9d in layers so that you are staring at dimensional paper woodlands.Food: First, who knew tea sommeliers (masters) were a thing? We each selected a tea for our palates. The moods at the table were: Rose, Oolong and Green-all delightful. The dude from Great Expectations gave the condensed biography of our caviar: Russian sturgeon raised in Italy. These were ceremoniously served in mother of pearl spoons before the tea complements arrived in three tiered splendour. Then the tea cakes, scones, and sandwiches came in waves: chicken, salmon, tomato confit, duck eggs, cherry, pistachio and sponge. There was joy and also apricot cheesecake.Tea accoutrements, the honey, sugar and such, came with clever witticisms marked on the pottery. Service: Their attention to detail is demonstrably excellent. The only downside to dining was the 30 minute wait before our orders were taken. And yet. Five stars. We filled the time with ogling the egg pod shaped futuristic toilets. Reading the randomness in the sketches. People watching the cross-section of society that came to experience the glory that is Sketch. This was transformative and immersive dining. Would do again, 11 out of 10.",

There were all these interesting sketches on the wall with plush pink couches for us to sit on. Also, you need to visit the bathroom. We actually didn't know about it prior but definitely a visit is a must. FYI, you have a two hour limit. We were there a bit over an hour. The service was very on par given that it is a Michelin star restaurant. You have unlimited tea - you try everything if you want. Our favorite was the caviar, egg, scones, and mini sandwiches. The dessert was okay. You will be full. It is a bit pricey. It was our second most expensive dining experience of our 8 day London trip.",

One of the hosts had terrible body odor that wafted through the room and did impact the ambience of the afternoon. All in all it's an experience I would definitely recommend - the tea room is gorgeous and the desserts were out of this world.",

As we're both David Shrigley fans, we wanted to visit the place again in the current incarnation.I love The Gallery, I imagine I'm in a Wes Anderson film for 2 hours.We had \u00a0booking for 6.30 and when we arrived 10 minutes before the time, we were told to wait along with another few guests for the evening service, which we were told starts at 6.30 (although there were already people inside). Literary 2 minutes lady a posh looking couple arrived, storming the door and were immediately escorted into the main room. That wasn't nice. I recommend coming at the very beginning of the serving time as the place is mostly empty, so it's nicer and quieter, so you can enjoy the place more for yourself and take photos without \u00a0feeling embarrassed and risking catching come c-celebrity in your selfie.I started with the sashimi, which was meant to be an homage to the artist in residency, but was nothing more than an average and over-salted sashimi at a double price. The started was followed by a prawn dish, that was tasty, but not very big (literary 6 prawns with a spicy sauce) My boyfriend had a fish pie and that was much better and very filling. After two average dishes we found it hard to pick desserts as most of the descriptions weren't convincing. In the end I picked up what was sounding at least half exciting, but turned out to be one of the most fun desserts I've ever had. It was a creamy milky soup with pink bubble gum tasting ice-cream, tiny marshmellows, and pop candies. As a birthday babe I also got two tiny sweets. The wine by glass is well overpriced. Even if good quality, you get a tiny amount in a huge glass that last for about 3 sips and then you have to order again. Bottle is much a better option from the start.",

My partner and I were too full to even bother to ask for more (which you are fully allowed to) whenever prompted.

But I forgot to make a reservation and didn't get in. No big deal. I still got to see it and sat in an equally magical room with a friendly staff and fabulous food. Speaking of staff, they all wear designer outfits which were remarkable and so fashion forward I would have totally bought one. My husband and I hung out for the afternoon there and had a late lunch and lots of wine. I must comment on the restrooms because it is a one of a kind potty experience with portable egg toilets that make you feel like you are somewhere in the future. Sketch is the most spectacular one of a kind place and I highly recommend! It is a must!",

    "text": "INCREDIBLE PLACE. \u00a0Food, wine, service, ambiance, everything was absolutely fantastic. FOOD: We did tasting menu with wine paring. My partner did vegetarian version, and I did non-vegetarian one. \u00a0Every single course was beautiful, interesting and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. There was no dish I liked \"just ok.\" \u00a0My partner also loved every course of vegetarian tasting menu. An interesting thing was that vegetarian menu was 20% cheaper than non-vegetarian one and vegetarian menu has one more course than non-vegetarian one. Paring as well. (Vegetarian tasting menu: \u00a395 for 7 courses, paring: \u00a395 , Non-vegetarian tasting menu: \u00a3120 for 6 courses, paring: \u00a3120)WINE: It was probably the BEST WINE PARING I've ever experienced in my life. I was wonderfully surprised and almost shocked by how perfect it was for every course. SERVICE: It was exquisite. There didn't seem to be assigned or main servers for each table. Instead all servers were working on us and other tables, which I liked a lot. \u00a0For one course, our sommelier couldn't bring paring wine before dishes were placed in front of us. We were going to wait for wine without starting eating the course. But next second, they noticed about that and brought wine for us within 30 seconds instead of keeping us wait for the sommelier. (The sommelier came back to our table to explain the wines while we were enjoying them.)AMBIANCE: Interesting and grand. I love it.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: There was no female service person or sommelier on the floor!!!! \u00a0To make things worse, there was one female outside the floor just standing in a costume of maid!! I didn't ask the reason of all about this crazy situation. So I don't know, but it looked to me that some gender discrimination was going on. This is why I marked four stars instead of five. Since I didn't ask the reason and also I've been seen only one night, I mark four stars instead of less.",

However it took ten minutes for anyone to even stop by our table in the Gallery. Hosts, servers and the proletariat-styled utility servers were all buzzing about but we felt utterly rejected and had to ask just to order. It was very disappointing to say the least since I had been so excited to bring my family here. My martini didn't even have olives after I had requested them in my order and it was brought out twenty minutes after the rest of the drinks at the table. I will go back someday but perhaps to a different salon. The staff in the Gallery were just not up to par with the delicious menu and unforgettable installation.",

    "text": "Sketch London was an absolute disappointment. When we were visiting London in September, my boyfriend and I made reservations and I was so so excited to finally be able to experience this place. His mom and sister were in London as well, so we had all planned to go together for a special night together. Right off the bat they wouldn't let my boyfriend in because of how he looks and they were incredibly insulting. They told him that he looked too \"jarring\" for their establishment, but his mom, sister and I were welcomed inside. His mom explained to them that we had come from California and I had been planning to come here for years, so they reluctantly let us in. Our table wasn't ready yet so they had us go to the bar where there was an apology drink waiting for my boyfriend. He wasn't drinking, but we thought it was at least a nice offer. I was almost in tears at this point because of how belittling they were to us, but I was trying to make the most of it, especially since they apologized and tried to accommodate us. I ordered a mimosa for myself and when I got the receipt the \"complimentary\" apology beer was 15 pounds... I looked at the bartender only to have him give me a snarky look in return, so I didn't bother complaining and just paid for the drinks. We waited 30/40 minutes past our reservation time until they finally seated us after having to remind them multiple times that we were waiting. Our waitress was incredibly rude and treated us like we didn't belong there and didn't have enough money to be in their restaurant. We each ordered what we wanted but when we declined drinks she blatantly scoffed, pursed her lips and rolled her eyes. By the time we finished my boyfriend and I were both incredibly upset and I was in tears. I've never been anywhere, let alone a restaurant, where the staff made me feel so beneath them and belittled. I had hoped that this would be a special place for us to create memories when we visit London and after our experience I will never step foot in here again.",

Sure, they serve meals, but I'm here today to talk to you about that liquor.Firstly, bring yo camera phone, because you will want to take selfies. This space oozes cool, from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy bathrooms, to the English tea time pink dining rooms (the booths look like pink lady fingers) and three (3!!!!) bars inside to choose from. It was my last night in London and I wanted to celebrate. My friend and I eyed the drink list and she mouthed to me \"champagne\". Eff the exchange rate! Sexy people here so don't come in with your leggings and boat shoes. Not that there's a dress code...The rest, kind of a blur. Don't really remember getting home, but aren't all the best nights like that?Great venue for friends, dates, showing off to your country bumpkin friends and showing off to your hard-to-please-American-gals (cough, cough me).",

    "text": "One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. And I dine out several times a week. I rarely leave reviews but it was a negative enough experience to where I have to say something. We visited Sketch during my first visit to London. We booked for brunch in the Glade on a Monday morning. As in, not peak hours. The service was non existent. We waited over 20 minutes just to be greeted and receive a menu but noticed the server attend the table next to us at least 4 times in the same time span. Our order was never taken and finally we moved to the parlor. The server was more affable in that room but the service was still painfully slow. We had to wait another 20 minutes just for our coffees. It seemed they had one server for the entire room when they know the rooms will be full given you have to make a reservation beforehand. We noticed other tables complaining about the service and looking miserable as well. The menu was overpriced and the cheese and crackers was a complete rip off. Three of the thinnest crackers I've ever seen and some small cheese cubes on a plate for 12 pounds. The rest of the food was ok. It seems they prepped the aesthetics of this place for instagram and then forgot to properly train wait staff. Perhaps they do not care. I don't recommend unless you have 2+ hours to spare for overpriced bites. Very disappointing.",

For a Michelin star restaurant I expect more, much more. At Sketch it is condescending, inattentive and impatient. Forget about tea & clotted cream top ups. You'll be lucky to get someone's attention to get your bill.The food. The only sandwich that was worth landing in my memory is cheesy compte one. Nice & crunchy. The rest were...well. Sandwiches.There was a lot of sweet stuff alright. Just because you're pink, Sketch, doesn't mean you need to kill your customers with sugar. Opera cake was nice but the rest of the pastries were just disappointment. And scones? I was given a *choice* of scones. I could only have raisin OR plain, nope, not both. Let alone there were no savoury choices for scones (kudos for Mad Hatter Afternoon tea at Sanderson's - they've got it right).I was hosting guests from abroad here, so at least bathroom impressed them. At least they've got that right... This review would probably not change a thing. The food would still be mediocre, the service still bad and ambiance still not do it. And people would still give it rave reviews. Disappointed.",

By 5pm we were still waiting for our tea to arrive, let alone the scones.
