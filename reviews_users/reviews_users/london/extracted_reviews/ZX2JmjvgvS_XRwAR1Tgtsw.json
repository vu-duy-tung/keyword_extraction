Perhaps it was the time that my friends and I turned up - 2.30am on a weekend night. Now, I would have thought that this was a perfectly acceptable time to pitch up for a reasonably big club like this, but it felt like everyone was closing up and going home! I bet you all know this feeling, when the barmen look like they would rather be tucked up in bed (I can't blame them), and the comfy lounging sofas are doubling up as beds for all the tired customers. The place was also half empty, which didn't help the cause much. Our group decided to see if there was anywhere in the club which had more going on, but were slightly disappointed to find that it was also smaller then we expected. We stayed around on the dance floor for a bit before calling it a night. I think for the sake of fair and even journalism I should come back and give it a shot at a less ungodly hour.",

It's like a maze in here. Lots of small balcony areas with cushions on the floor, big central dancefloor and bar, upstairs club and roof terrace too. The food isn't bad either. The best thing about the big chill house (showing its festival roots) though, is the music. I've been to an all day sunday band session, several great club nights and seen coldcut live - which was one of my best nights out ever! The place is so small that you can chat to the dj's and bands during and after their sets... check out the photos :)",

It is a wide a space with a mezzanine area whichcan be booked for parties. At weekends the rest of the venue opens up with an upstairs bar, a heated outdoor area and some seating sections downstairs in the basement. As the main area is already quite big it means that the place can really attract the crowds and have a good time. The bar area is large, the staff are excellent, as are their range of drinks and cocktails. Service is quite fast and entrance after 9pm at weekends is not too expensive. That the venue is situated right by the tube makes it a great place to have a party or meet a large crowd without worrying about travelling home.",

There was a small queue of about 5 people to get in which didn't take long and your hand is stamped as you go in so you don't have to worry about not being able to get back in. I think it was \u00a35.00 to get in and we got there at about 1 am so it's pretty cheap. Once we got in we only had to wait about 5 mins to get served, not too sure how much the drinks were though - I had gone past caring by that point. As I had never been there before myself and my boyfriend and I decided to go and explore! We walked around the different levels and rooms, unfortunately excluding the terrace as you can't take drinks there! It was a really nice place, we had a few drinks, did a bit of dancing, had a chat and met some great new people. The place genrally has a good atmosphere and I look forward to going there again!",

It has got a bit of a reputation amongst people who like a quieter night as it can get extremely busy and rowdy on a weekend, especially later on, but in general the atmosphere is good. A redeeming feature is the first class music they put on, often for free on a sunday afternoon. Lots of the stars of the modern folk scene play sets, the DJs are fantastic and it can feel like a cool festival once you turn your back on the view of pentonville road! My preference is to check out the music, but if you like your night busy, loud and manic, then friday is for you!",

    "text": "It must be that Londoners have a different understanding of the word \"chill\" because my (American) friends and I found ourselves a bit overstimulated during our time in the Big Chill House. I am giving it three stars because, as far as clubs go (and on the weekends, TBCH is definitely more like a club than anything else), this one is indeed \"A-OK.\" I'll reiterate again that my friends and I were not looking for a club that night, but had heard that the conveniently-located Big Chill House was a good place to drink beer. It's neither chill, nor a good place to drink beer (unless you like drinking \u00a34 Heineken in a club whose clientele is--as I'll later explain--a bit skewed, age-wise). I thought about giving it one or two stars, but then realized that such a low rating would have been more about my (apparently misguided) expectations than about the place itself.As I said, insofar as it is a club, it's really not a bad one. I don't really prefer the dominant club scene here in London, and have been to some awful clubs where I couldn't escape the shitty music or the constant and suffocating presence of sweaty, drunk lads. On the other hand, the Big Chill House seemed different: \u00a0the interior hosts a number of nooks and tucked-away seating, and you can always distance yourself from the bar and the music if you so desire. The different levels are not just like mezzanines that overlook a main space below but instead have a separate, secluded feel. The more modern-aesthetic of second level offers a VIP kind of space for lounging around with I guess whoever you lounge around with in a VIP kind of space. When I went, this section was reserved for a private party. Too bad. Those chair/booth/lounger/bed things looked comfortable. The music the DJ was playing wasn't so bad. It wasn't good either, but plenty of people were dancing. The clientele were what was truly bizarre. Some friends had stopped by a couple weekends ago and mentioned that the crowd seemed a bit older than us: \u00a0late twenties/early thirties. We arrived expecting something similar, but with a twist: \u00a0there were also a strange amount of very young-looking people. Were they really eighteen? Maybe they just looked and acted like eighteen-year-olds? People were clearly enjoying themselves. I think I saw one booth take probably seventy digital pictures in less than three minutes. One drunk thirtysomething guy had a stuffed shark whose hand (er, fin?) he was forcing everyone to high five. Needless to say, as students in our early 20s looking for something truly chill (i.e. a place that was less-crowded with quieter music but still a lively enough for some good beer-drinking and conversation) we felt out of place and left after one pint. The end. They're open from what must be 7 a.m. until 4 a.m. every day, because I always see people in there for breakfast or lunch or evening pints. Maybe I'll go back during one of those times.",

It's got a pleasant atmosphere, laidback but cool. The main area is spacious and open, but there are several other rooms to explore (apparently there is a special Finlandia room somewhere in the basement!). But best of all, there's a really great terrace! According to some dude in Time Out the bar's got a 'cutting-edge selection of spirits', but the selection of what's on tap is pretty meagre: Heineken and Guinness. And cider. It's also pretty expensive. So I guess they're mostly catering for the weekend crowd (there are also lots of DJ events here). Still, though, the fabulous terrace makes it a worthwhile place to go for an after-work drink if you're in the neighbourhood.",

The venue is large and is split over three floors, food is reasonable and d\u00e9cor is original if a little under whelming. The big cachet here is the terrace where you can enjoy your drinks under the sun, despite being in the heart of the Cross it does have a certain Iberian feel which is often aided by the DJs. This place stays open late and they have different events on most nights. I cant imagine coming up here solely for this bar but if you are in the vicinity it is worth a visit. For locals the Sunday Brunch is excellent value for money and exactly what the doctor ordered if you have over done it the night before.",

We got there about 8 ish and were the only people in the place for about 2 hours but the music was still turned up full, so we needed to shout in each others ears even though we were sat next to each other on the sofa. We didn't mind that much though, we sort of enjoyed the surreality of the experience. The place reminds me quite a lot of a student union",

I'm not sure what i imagined but it certainly wasn't this. It's a strange mish-mash of themes - there's a log-cabin-themed area downstairs complete with fake fires on screen, a Love Inn upstairs with leather pods to lounge in, and a roof terrace up top. The latter has a few great areas for groups, but is ruined by some incredibly uncomfortable benches and badly thought-out arrangement.I've been here for a couple of nights out and neither was amazing - the strange mix of styles leaves you feeling a bit lost and uncomfortable, and I wasn't a fan of the music either. If a funk/chill-out is your style though you might be onto a winner.My best visit was during the day, when the downstairs is more like a pub and does much better for it. The food is also terribly over-priced and you don't get much for your money. However, I did order an Irish Coffee here once, and the effort and time that went into it was amazing, and the taste matched, so I'd recommend the place for cocktails.",

I email in and was easily able to reserve an area for 30 people. On arrival we were given the large area with a low ceiling to the right of the bar. It was perfect. The winning points to this place are it's large wrap around bar, huge dance floor, a decent amount of seating across three levels AND a mah-ussive beer garden. The beer garden will be awesome in summer and they do take reservations for it. NOTED.We grabbed a quick bite before everyone arrived. I opted for the \u00a35 hot dog and some fries. For \u00a35 the hot dog was good - a lovely, large bratwurst with plenty of ketchup and mustard and a soft bun. Bingo. The chips were good too - hot and perfectly salted. Quick, easy and cheap. I was happy. Then the night really commenced! Our guests began to arrive and everyone was happy with the area. The music was great, the only downside was that he kept mixing the songs. Sometimes we want to listen to a song all the way through you know. Never cut Bieber short! Lastly, the drink costs. \u00a37.50 for a double absolute vodka and blackcurrent - I won't lie, it hurt every time I pulled our my cash card but that's me being Northern, and I guess these are London prices. We had a great night! We stayed until 3am and even that was too early. One last note, the bouncer on the door was lovely. We had a few really good chats. He was so friendly and chatty which is very rare for a bouncer.",

After coming here for the first time on a Thursday after work I found it to be the perfect sanctuary for meeting up with friends which was what most people seemed to be doing there. I found this place after searching on Google bars with free WiFi. So I called them to to enquire if this was really true and it was. The drinks are fairly cheap (for London), good vibes, decor a bit funky and the staff were quite friendly. I booked a table and turned up a little early but got my table pretty much straight away. Feeling a bit pecking I ordered a burger. It was a blue cheese, caramelised onion and button mushrooms beef burger in a brioche bun. It was alright, not quite a good as it sounded on paper though. Plus it took quite a while to arrive at my table at which point I was getting impatient and wasting away over there. The music was on point, some classic tunes playing that one could sing along to (which I did). This place has a thumbs up from me.",

Also, maybe I'm so used to city types because I work there, this place is not city at all, it's buzzing with media and fashion types which isn't a surprising as its so close to Shoreditch and Islington. I felt a bit out of place in my city girl heels and pencil skirt because everyone is super casual. Anyways, the bar itself on the rooftop is super tiny and seems to run out of supplies pretty fast and only one person is serving so if you can, you should get drinks downstairs first. Downstairs is massive, but I assume it doesn't really get lively til late and we were there for after work rooftop drinks- it's a bit sticky, and it's cheap, and a bit student so go with an open mind. I did walk past their drawing room and that looks super cosy but again, it was pretty empty when we went.You have to try their coconut and lime cider, it's like a lighter Malibu cocktail!The views: uh, not the best views in the city for sure, but you're there for cheap drinks and a makeshift rooftop tiki bar.

It's a roomy place, well-decorated, and a nice place to chat with your friends. The bartender (you have to walk up to the bar to order your food) was very sweet. The food, however, was very...meh. My friend and I shared the crab burger and the broccoli. The presentation of the food was great, and I really liked their fries, but the burger itself was lackluster, and the broccoli was nothing to squack about.

Firstly, it smells like chemicals when you walk up the stairs onto the terrace... not sure what is going on there. Secondly, our server was incredibly rude. She literally made up house rules as she went. She was very unhappy with the fact that some of us wanted to start on drinks but order food later once everyone in our party had arrived, as the \u00a315 bottomless mimosa / bloody marys are only supposed to be if you get food as well. Despite our assurances that we would order food once everyone had arrived, she was not happy. My friend had also asked when he made the booking if everyone at the table had to do the bottomless deal and was told no, but then she clearly thought otherwise and gave us some attitude until conceding that her colleague may have said otherwise because they JUST changed the rules. The mimosas themselves were good, with some legit orange pulp at least, but no one thought their drink was particularly alcoholic. On the flip side, they were reasonably attentive about refilling the drinks, as sometimes these bottomless deals can go terribly awry when they just slow down the service. As for the food, I think it also left a lot to be desired. I had the brunch burger and felt a bit sick afterward. The avocado toast looked awful... they'd done something to make the guacamole very runny. I wouldn't recommend anything we ordered, but I guess they make money because they make you get it with the drinks. The DJ was also playing music far too loudly, so it was difficult to have a conversation. This place has a lot of potential, but there are many better rooftops and beer gardens out there.",

The name, truly a terrible name, and the exterior of the building makes it look like it's a hostel for Australians. But inside it's quite nice, roomy for friends to meet and the very best part is the roof terrace.We popped up to watch a film in their rooftop cinema and stopped off to have a drink at the bar. It's not a huge space but there's plenty of seating and they serve food and drink to your table. Pretty handy if you're kinda lazy, which I'm not, of course. Check out their weekly rooftop screenings of classic movies, it cost \u00a33 and included the movie, a cocktail and some popcorn. They'll also deliver food and drinks to you during the movie.",

    "text": "Drinks date, on a roof top. Lovely. The sun was out on the vertical seedling roof garden and only a smattering of pollution and fags clouding my view between me and the flock of ripe young hot stuff trotting about in canvas espadrilles, I was reassured I'd have a chill time. With benches, drinks served in tin cans, boys with beards, grubby toilets, ironic retro tunes, overpriced drinks... *the sound of the needle slipping off the record*. No wonder it's called the Big Chill. You're gonna need to take a bloody chill-pill after ordering, \u00a34.50 for a bottle of Meantime! Certainly was mean. Now as evening draws in I need something to warm my cockles, it's sunny spring in England and I'm underdressed for the plummet in temperature which the Big Chill has brought about my shoulders. Next time I'll be giving them the chilly cold shoulder darlings and heading to warmer climes.",
