You can buy a loaf of bread here for 7 POUNDS. For 1 loaf. I kid you not Mr Moneybags!Princi simply seems to be about looking good and being expensive. It's the food equivalent to the make-up and perfume stands that clutter the entrance to every department store.",

But inevitably the prices have increased and service has gotten surly. It's quite hard to get a table, and once you're done eating, the staff are quick to usher you out the door. The salads aren't the best and the options are rather limited for the price. 7-8 pounds for a \"big plate\" which barely fits 3 selections! The cakes now are about \u00a34.5 a slice which in my opinion is too steep although the passionfruit cheesecake is still to die for. They stopped making the chocolate eclairs which were my favourite dessert overall which is another thing that I wish they didn't change! All in all, used to be one of my favourite Soho hangouts that got ruined by the surly service, ridiculous price increases, and difficulty in getting a table.",

    "text": "After a long day at work capped by an average dinner, and suffering a bit from jet lag, I set out in search of an establishment that met a few important criteria:1 - that it be open late2 - that it be located within reasonable walking distance3 - that it provide top notch pastries that would be worth eating at midnightPrinci fit the bill. I was surprised to see people waiting behind the velvet rope despite the late hour. Fortunately, given that I was not looking for a table, I was able to get right inside. The place is beautiful, and the pastries and bakery items are nicely arranged, making it somewhat more difficult to make a decision. The question remained: would everything taste as good as it looked?Almost everything rated highly.They were out of one of the items I was looking for. Neither of the two versions of their Mille Foglie listed on the menu was available. Too bad. I'm always on the lookout for \u00a0good interpretation of the classic mille feuilles, whatever language it's said it.Instead, I went for the Selva Nera (black forest). It was near perfect. Perfectly balanced, creamy, not overly sweet, and with just a hint of cherries. I could have eaten a half-dozen without missing a beat.I also got the amaretto and chocolate trancia, which provided quite a contrast to the Selva Nera. Dense, heavy, rich, yet delectable. You'll either need to share it with someone or make it your entire meal.As a big fan of pistachio in general, I couldn't help but also get a slice of the peach and pistachio cake. Nicely flavored, dense, but a bit dry, it was a bit of a let-down after the other two. Maybe it was because of the late hour, or maybe it was because I was on my third cake. I'd like to give it another try, just to make sure.I'll be returning to Princi again and again. Style and substance, all day and evening long.",

    "text": "I wish there was a 2.5 option. This place is ok. Not great but certainly not bad either. It's an updated business model of the traditional Panetteria/focacceria. Unfortunately it's also a paragon of style over substance, which is quite fitting for a chain originating from Milan. I totally agree with the \"eat with your eyes\" comment on one of the reviews - the vast selection from pastries and pizzette to sfogliatell' and cannoli. Almost all the food behind the counter looks awesome, resulting in an overwhelming desire to order one of everything. Taste-wise however, speaking as an italian, it's not all that. particularly re the pizze - there are several genuinely authentic Neapolitan or even Roman pizzerie in London (Donna Margherita; Sartori/Santor\u00e8, Finos to name but a few). Their cannoli are not appreciably better than those you can buy over the counter at bar Italia or Lina's Deli, the price however is appreciably higher. Oh, and the coffee ain't great.That said, it does have a great selection of both savory and sweet food, it's in a great location, and if you can tolerate the bedlam surrounding the seating hunt, then it's a good place to pop into for a quick bite.",

I can see what everyone means about trying to get a seat! It's quite hard. I walked in, and took a look at everything they offered, and you definitely have to just grab a server's attention cause i stood there for ages trying to decide what i wanted and then to actually order it.... There was a whole section of sweets, then pizza, then bread/stuff then some pasta-ish dishes which really probably wasn't pasta but i can't seem to remember what they were...and at the end are the drinks. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, a slice of it for 4.30 pounds which was quite pricy so i picked the biggest piece and pointed it out to him when i finally got his attention. Then i also ordered a small cappuccino for 2.30 pounds. I grabbed a seat at table with these random people and was just listening to what they were talking about, tv shows and how if they were american or british and if they liked it or not. haha, quite amusing while i ate. I guess they are suppose to take your tray away after you get to your table. That's cool. I wouldn't know what to do with it either. And they clean up after you leave. There's only a bathroom for each gender and a disabled you can use as well. The pizza was okay, it wasn't anything extra special, but since it was just outta the oven it was quite hot and yummy, it was very thick which i loveee and i was going to choose another pizza but this was new...and looked mighty appetizing. The cappuccino was okay, nothing special about that either.. It's a bit high of a price for average food, but service was nice and i did sample practically everything while i waited...moving down each counter..lol and the person who made my cappuccino probably noticed i was american and i had only said \"cappuccino\" to him...so he was telling me to try this sample that was offered in italy or something during christmas, and it was good, though i already had a piece when i came in :P I probably would only come back to try the dessert next time, but they are over 3 pound at least... so have to think about that!",

However, It is safe to say my pizza hunting adventures are over now that I have made it to Princi. Having convinced a friend that Princi was a Pizza place, and therefore Italian and probably did risotto (which is what she wanted), off we went to Princi. For the record, the pizzeria is just Pizza (with 2 pasta options).Nonetheless, we got seated rather quickly and were greeted by out waiter with a very Italian \"Yes?\". That must be Italian for may I help you... I ordered the Veriso and a friend the Margarita with various other toppings (they kindly let her pick and choose her selection of toppings as she didn't quite fancy any of the predetermined ones - very accommodating). The food came quickly and we swiftly started our delicious pizzas. The dough was a little more thick than a normal Italian pizza, but absolutely amazing. The toppings were fresh and crust perfectly golden. Verdict? Great location, decent prices, and good service. I will definitely be back!",

I am Italian and I make a point to visit Princi multiple times every time I travel to London (which is at least 3-4 times a year). The food is quite authentic and the presentation is nice, prices are pretty high, but worth it for us, since it is difficult to find good Italian food where we live, unfortunately though the place is always very busy and pickpockets have found their way in this establishment which has ruined the experience entirely for us. I don't think I will ever go back. In our last trip to London we arrived to London late morning, checked into our hotel nearby and walked to Princi for lunch. The food is ordered at a long counter with cashier point at the end of it, drinks are paid for at the same location, however they are collected at a separate bar counter.It was a Saturday at around 2pm, my husband paid for food and drinks while I looked for seating and then he moved towards the bar counter. The thieves must have spotted him putting his wallet away before heading to the other counter and his credit cards where stolen while he was waiting for the beverages. While we were eating the thieves went on a \u00a35,000.00 (five thousand pounds) shopping spree in nearby establishments.How do I know it happened at Princi? Because we did not stop anywhere else. We went straight from the hotel to Princi. My husband's cards were all in his wallet when he paid for food and right after lunch we walked straight back to the hotel which is literally 3 minutes away. It could have not happened anywhere else. I am pretty sure this has happened before and I wonder if management has done anything to prevent it. Shame on them!",

Sono ancora di stucco e anche se la cameriera ci ha dato ragione non e' che serva a molto. Abbiamo dovuto fare un secondo pranzo altrove. La pizza va abbastanza bene ma non eccezzionale.",

    "text": "My first morning in London, found me a bit jet lagged and surprisingly hungry. I noticed next to my little doggy bed a breakfast menu for the hotel, which stated that their breakfast came from Princi Bakery in Soho. Instead of having breakfast in bed, I decided to get myself cleaned up and go to their restaurant. And here is where the review gets tricky.The restaurant is beautifully designed open and inviting. The center of the room holds the wood-fire grill for what is supposed to be their famous pizza's from Milan. Yes, this is a Milanese restaurant. A not so friendly waiter who seemed to be having a bad morning greeted us. After dropping off the menu, he quickly left. We waited, and waited a bit more before he returned to take our order. Once again we waited, and waited, and waited some more. The waiter had simply vanished he was nowhere to be seen. Finally a woman came to our table (after a good 20 minutes) to ask if we were okay, we explained what had happened, she apologized and immediately corrected the situation. Our juice, cappuccinos, and pastries were brought to our table.The pastries were out of the world. Coming from the United States where you're never sure what you'll get when a croissant is ordered, this was truly amazing. Now I know what true French pastries are like. During our meal, we had three other employees of the restaurant checking in with us, including the manager (I believe) and it wasn't until the plates were cleared that our mysterious waiter with the attitude showed up. And once again after passing by our table a half-dozen times I literally had to stop him and ask for our bill.After talking to friends about this experience, I'm told that it's not uncommon to have such dramas unfold at some of the finest Milan restaurants, so if this is true than this place is spot on for bringing the essence of Milan to Soho.If you don't mind a bit of drama and emotional meltdown from your wait staff, then this place is worth the trip.Shatasdogbowl",

But they kind of take reservations, and if you want to have a pizza in a 2 hours timein soho this is one of the few places where you can have something decent. But ridiculously overpaid.This is a difficult-to-be-missed place, right in the center of Soho, with very big windows, and a queue outside. The personnel at the entrance is usually very kind, and as I said before the best part is that they kind of take reservations, in the sense that you ask for a table, they take your reservation and they send you an sms when the table is ready. Something that both Manca and Pilgrims (much better pizza places) don't, and whenever you are a big group this is something you need!But then... I mean pizza is kind of ok, a bit on the too fluffy for my taste but it's still an ok pizza, they have menabrea, a common beer in northern italy which seems a bit difficult to find around here, but the price is something that makes me super angry: a pizza+a beer + some shared olives comes around 30 pounds pp... I mean seriously, more than 40 Euros for a pizza! It's just ridiculous, nobody ever tried to set a price that is so high! damn you Princi, you do not deserve to stay in my pizza list!!",

Also, every server and hostess we interacted with were actually Italian, which was a good sign. We shared the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella appetizers, which was so fresh and delicious, I wouldn't be surprised if they have it flown in directly from Italy every day. We then split a pizza and the carbonara, plus a half bottle of wine. Everything was incredibly fresh and authentic, and reminded me of some of the best food I ate in Italy. Service was good, though the food took a little long to come out, I assume because it was very busy. We were too tired for desert, so instead we took a torte back to our hotel, and it was delicious. Definitely worth checking out next time we are in London.",

You walk in and you basically kind of stand in line~~ Use good judgement if there's someone waiting....the reason for this is that it looks like a cafeteria lunch line...but if you're only getting desserts just walk in and stand by the desserts if you're getting food pass up the dessert people and stand near the food~ Can be kind of annoying and crazy when it's busy~ After paying for the food at the end of the \"lunch line\"...if you've paid for drinks you get them at the \"bar\".. which is at the very back of the entire place. Then you carry your tray and find a seat... Although it's always been busy when i've gone i never waited for a free spot. what i liked: 1. the salad (big plate = pick 4) (small= pick 2)2. the beef lasagna is good/ very cheesy and rich3. cakes were OK~ try the passion fruit cheese cake~ loved the tang of the passion fruit 4. Pizza OKI too~** I don't know what it is about this place~ maybe it's the all italian work crew that makes me feel like it's authentic? the food isn't amazing but i just like going here to people watch and i like the hustle and bustle of it~ This review may sound ambiguous but...i gave it 4 stars because it's just one of those places i like... just because.... and would go back again... just because~",

I didn't know that the place would be so busy - I recommend making a reservation in advance. However, the very nice Ma\u00eetre d brought us menus while we waited in line behind the velvet like ropes at the front of the restaurant. As you are standing on the street in this odd line with the smell of bread and pizza wafting out the door you can't help but get excited for this place. The service was great, everyone was extremely helpful and nice. I asked a lot of questions and all of them were answered and suggestions were offered when I wasn't sure what to order.We got a table in the back corner of the sit down area (not the buffet area). While waiting for our food to arrive I snuck over to the buffet style area to order some extra pastries to take home. From the buffet area, I picked up a loaf of semolina bread, chocolate cookie, passion fruit cheesecake, and the black forest cake (recommended by the server). The passion fruit cheesecake was incredible. The square of punchy goodness was the perfect thing to eat as soon as we got back to our flat.After picking my way through the goodies at the bar, I went back to our table. We ordered the bruschetta (comes with tomato basil, olive tapenade, and aubergine), braesaola, rocket, and parmesan antipasti, and margherita pizza. I loved the pizza. The sauce was perfect, not to sweet not too tomatoey. The cheese on the pizza was very fresh and had a really nice flavor to it. We finished our meal off with three profiteroles. They were TO DIE FOR. YUM.*Edit - I forgot to add we also ordered the spaghetti carbonara which was pretty good as well. (I am really picky when it comes to carbonara and this almost lived up to my insane expectations)",

It is also one of the rare places around Soho that can serve you quality food straight away which is such a rare commodity and much needed when you're in want of a quick dinner before going to the theatre. The Pizza Capricciosa I had was a bit tough but certainly filling with a good sprinkling of olives, ham, mushroom and mozzarella. The Rainbow salad was one of the nicest salads I ever remember having as there was a good range of different vegetables, such that I don't even know what they were, but they were indeed crunchy and appetising. The Pasta salad was very pleasant too with pesto, pine nuts and small bits of tomato in the mix. What looked like a 'scotch egg' was actually an Arancino di Riso (which tastes like lasagne in a breadcrumb fried crispy ball). Finally the chamomile tea was just what you would want; fresh, fragrant and refreshing. The downsides to Primchi is that the food is rather cold, the service a little haphazard as one long counter gives rise to inevitable confusion with where the queue begins and where it ends, and the seating is much like a canteen that is filled to the brim. Nevertheless, Primchi is great to have around; significant effort and attention to detail can be seen in all the food and drink and the infinite display on show is enough to tickle your taste buds at any time.",

Pizzas cost about 2.50 a slice. Lasagnes start from 6 quid.At princi, you order and collect your food from the counter and then try to find somewhere to sit hence the reason for only 4 stars as the only seating available is one long narrow central table which means that at peak hours its quite difficult to find somewhere to sit and enjoy your meal.",

The cannoli (or what I would call a cannoli) are perfect little moments of custard pastry heaven, and at 80p each they are a bargain. Haven't had coffee or any drinks here, I am sure they are all good. One complaint, the water feature makes me feel like I am eating in Hakkasan's or Yauatcha's toilet. Think it detracts from the general Scandinavian womb-like quality of the rest of the place. Go eat!",

Don't mind the crowds and enjoy a quick, fresh, delish lunch at one of the communal tables. Also great for coffee and heavenly desserts with friends in an upbeat environment. Prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "This is a funny place. Imagine the English confronted to a big dilemma: queuing when there's no queue in sight and no system clearly identified. Indeed in this modern Italian bakery there's no other way to order your croissants or lasagna than to grab someone's attention. You'd better bag seats first, then go and order the food. After ordering you're supposed to go to the bar where you pay for everything. Service is quick but not impatient. All the waiters are Italian and this adds to the charm of the place. There are not many seats. People stand and eat at the same time at small tables made of granite and porphyry. There are also seats along the back wall where water is constantly flowing. Along the counter you can choose what you fancy among the varieties of bread, salads, pasta, pizza slices and pastries(I can only talk about pastries. We had a Millefeuille starwberry, a chocolate cake, a glass of red wine and an expresso: all delicious). It's not very expensive and suits perfectly to a late breakfast or a pre-meal. Princi is an Italian that exists already in Milano and has been imported by the Alan Yau, the restaurateur. It's a joint venture, not his own project but this is a refreshing addition to Soho's restaurant scene. It's hip but not pretentious. It's about sharing, sharing food with friends and space with the other customers. It's also an interesting architectural experience.",

    "text": "It's more grapple than Grappa in here!\u00a0Surrounded by the running water feature in Princi, it rather created a calm or in my case counteracted the cacophonous din in this food-hall, sorry fighting arena where diners, usually decent folk- I'm sure, have to tussle for a chance to get a place to sit at a table all-whilst clutching a tray.\u00a0So use the flowing feature to wash your hands, or your mouth out, as getting a table needs fighting talk. It's no good if there's a school of you, you'll never get to eat together. You'll be split into pairs and I warn you, one of you'll have to stand guard of your place whilst the other queues for food and on their return, repeat this process yourself.\u00a0Princi creates the frustrating feeling of what it must be like in a fishtank. Like a fish in a tank in Seaworld. Except this glass tank we were behind; the\u00a0long stretch of window where greasy passing Soho\u00a0noses press up against the cold panes, see a brightly floodlit hectic scrabbling Milanese-like scene, but diners clutch trays, scrumming for tables like sharp nosed sharks at feeding time. Although bright lights bounce off of the glossy coral red Romanesca topped tray bakes, shiny strawberry cheesecakes and gently glinting merengue topped lemon pavlovas it quite highlights what else could be up for grabs in this open area. One cannot deny Pelici is a Soho showpiece; a showstopper of a shopfront, but diners prowling for tables aren't the only ones lurking in the depths of soho. There are thieves stalking their prey, peeping in from the windows of Princi too, waiting for opportunities to squeeze in between the crush.\u00a0On a Friday evening it was impossible. The pool side life guard on the door simply couldn't attend to security and also had to run around the floor as a makeshift waiter. \u00a0Once again, there could be pick-pocketers pouncing whilst you go back up, buffet style to pick your pudding. Also with the doors open to all and sundry, I was cold and so was my dinner. So with chills, multiplying, I'm serious. That entrance, is as much of a security threat as are the cakes are for your health, so watch your bags if you're not watching your waist line.",

    "text": "Summary: + GREAT food AND DESSERT+ Spacious and chic ambience + Order at the counter, which also serves as food display+ Follow the sight of food, follow your heart + But remember, your eyes are bigger than your stomach + It gets very busy. So be ready to elbow your way in to find a spot Overall: Located in the heart of Wardour Street, this gorgeous Italian deli caf\u00e9 is one of my favourite places in SOHO. They have freshly baked breads, steaming hot pizza, salad bar, hot main dishes and great cakes. In other words, they have EVERYTHING. From outside, the place looks like a chic hotel restaurant. The interior does not betray your expectation. The dusky brightness of brass tables somehow matches the white marble walls and dark stone floor. The combination gives this large dining space a tasteful refinement without being glitzy. The place is apparently called Princi. I can never remember what it is called. The place is too stylish to have a big banner of their name at the back of the counter. The only branding they have outside the restaurant is very small and the fancy swirly font makes it impossible to decipher what is written. So when I refer to this place, I am usually forced to use rather unsophisticated descriptions such as \"that big posh Italian place in SOHO\". Hopefully, writing a review will help me remember the name of this charming caf\u00e9. Anyway, the place was as busy as usual when I went in for a dessert break. (I seem to do that a lot these days.) I often see one or two creative types with their laptops (mostly Mac) here but there were none of them that day. God knows what those people do for their lives I joined the group of people who are forming a kind of \"organic\" queue that you see in good old British pub. When I felt I had waited for a sufficient amount of time as a courtesy, I attracted an attention of one of the servers at the cake section and ordered Cremoso alla fragola (layered berry mousse cake). \u00a0Food: This three-layered delight came in the shape of a fluffy strawberry mousse sandwiched by a thin sheet of mixed berry jello on top and moist sponge at the base. The little bits of fresh berries in the top jello layer enhance the airy texture of the cake. I like the way all the elements worked together without one dominating another. \u00a0One other thing to mention is their toilet smells incredible. They have some sort of lemon grass incense that fills the private space with heavenly fragrance. That said, I have only been to male toilet. So I can't speak of female one. I only went there for a tea this time but they also have great food and bakery section. Maybe I will review them next time.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my cousin one night, and it was quite busy. The right side of the restaurant is self serve, and the left side is table service. This restaurant is quite large, but it was pretty crowded. When I first walked in, I was quite distracted from huge display of desserts and pastries they had! They all look decadent. I waited for a table for about 10 minutes. The table space was quite cramped, since I could barely get to my table. We ordered the antipasto to share, and I ordered the spaghetti with pancetta, and my cousin ordered the meat pizza. The appetizer came quickly, and there was a good selection of meats. The entrees took quick awhile to come. The server did tell me that the spaghetti takes a little longer, maybe because they're making it extra fresh for me?! Well, both entrees finally came. The spaghetti was good, but a little on the salty side because of the pancetta. I really enjoyed the sauce, and the pasta was cooked very well.Princi is very affordable, especially if you're coming from the U.S., and you are use to cheap food and big portions. They give a good amount of food without breaking your wallet. The only problem is service. I understand that service may not be a big thing here, but I shouldn't have to ask 5 times to the same person for water! I also took a few desserts home after, and they were delicious! Princi is one of the better meals I've had in London, so far.",

It's still pretty busy last time I went on a Saturday lunch time but we were able to get a table for two quite easily. They have expanded with what looks like a restaurant so perhaps people are booking ahead instead of chancing it. On the more casual side, you get a wonderful selection of Italian food, from pizza and fresh salads to the mouthwateringly enticing pastries and cakes. The staff at the counter is really friendly and bubbly, happy to take time and explain the food in front of you (especially if they have no or unhelpful labels). The staff that mills around the floor are eager to take your empty plates away as soon as you have finished indulging yourself, undoubtedly hinting you ought to move on. It's not somewhere you can stay very long at peak period, otherwise you get hungry diners glaring at you, hoping to get your table. But it is a wonderful place to catch up with a friend over some good food beyond your everyday sandwiches and baguettes.",

It's the kind of the place you don't mind coming to alone as you can sit in the window and people watch while you enjoy a meal. (Simply speaking from my personal experience) The pizza is what you must come for, grab a fork, a knife, and simply go to town. Gave me the feeling of being in Italy while in the UK. Clean the palate with a glass of Pinot Grigo and you will be set to see the sights of Soho. Glad I have a few more days in the UK as I'll be back again for sure!",

I felt the magnetic pull. This time it managed to suck me and my companion in!So really we were looking for some late drinks and snacks, and we were not disappointed. Broccoli, beetroot, ham & cheese and ricotta & spinach pastries, cannolis and a huge slice of cheesecake... all washed down with sambuca! I would rate this place as highly inside as on the outside. A good amount of money and effort has been put into making this place look amazing. Even the toilets were well designed. Staff here were very helpful and eager to help, but I do feel that they are hampered by their awkward till system. It was painful for both them and me to finish the actual transaction.Overall, a decent place. The only reason that it does not rate higher is that the food was pretty poor value for money.NB I was just about to post this as 3 stars.... but I forgot the evening doorman. He earns the place an additional star! Really. He was that good! Polite and respectful at all times - he really brought personality to the place. Give the man a pay rise!",

It's also cool that there is a waiter service section of the restaurant if you want something a bit more formal. I really liked the Princi breakfast - the sausage wasn't that great but the bacon was well cooked, the sourdough toast was a great accompaniment and the cannellini beans in tomato sauce had a rich flavour which enhanced everything else. The scrambled eggs were good too, although I actually ordered fried! Which brings me to the service which was very polite but a bit inattentive at times, although it was nice not to be rushed. Overall though, I think this is a great Soho spot.",

The water feature on the back wall throws calming ripples of light against the wall, which is a hilarious counterpoint to the frenzy of customers and staff you'll encounter at peak times.The similarities with Harrods end there, though. Unlike the famous Food Hall, everything here is actually worth the price of admission. Honestly, choose something at random and you'll have a good time in this place. Everything is prepared in house, with the baked items being cooked in their wood-fired oven and therefore being extra awesomely tasty. Their salads are fantastic and you can mix and match them in a box for a good lunch. Their hot meals look good, but I'll be honest and say I've never tried them - I never get far enough into the shop before something else catches my eye!They've also recently added a small pizzeria section. Their pizzas are again cooked in the wood fired oven and while they're a little bready to be considered 'proper Italian' pizzas, they're very, very good. My personal fave is the D.O.C, loaded with cherry tomato wedges, buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil leaves - basically a margarita turned up to eleven.What's great about this place is that it's open early for breakfast and stays open until late, making it a great venue for a quick bite to eat after a trip to the theatre or concert on a friday night. It does get busy, but this just adds to the mad Italian charm of it all.",

Unpretentious with a laid back atmosphere you'd be forgiven to expect that with no bookings taken and a first come first seated setup that the food would fall short of Soho's many fine eateries. However the food here is second to none. From the salads & pastas to the hot dishes and cakes, everything is wonderfully authentic Italian including the staff and half of the customers. Perfect for a first date over wine and cake this is my favourite place in London.Quick tip: when you arrive send your other half to find the seats whilst you grab the food. You'll thank me!",

First time was a few years ago when I still lived in London. Second visit was on a Wed night last week. Both times it was very crowded but it's definitely worth the wait. Everything from the desserts, bakery items to the pizza served in the main restaurant area was great. So authentically Italian! Even all the staff in here seem to be from Italy. And you hear a lot of Italian (language) spoken amongst the clientele too. I guess it is a good thing this place is far from home as I will be a fat b*tch eating so many good desserts. Yum.",

They have a large selection of baked goods, flat breads and pastas. Their wine list isn't overly priced, and the service is excellent (it also helps that quite a few of their servers are beautiful men and women).Finding a seat can be difficult, but I highly recommend grabbing a perching spot before ordering at the counter.",

Lucky guy.) and was starving, and noticed the line out the door. \u00a0Surprisingly because of the system they have (with pointing to your food and paying at the end of the counter, finding your table and ordering wine in a separate area) works like magic, that you're in and eating this deliciousness within no time.I ordered an antipasto sandwich with fresh arugula and basil, fresh tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella inside a ciabatta bread. \u00a0OMFG. Boyfriend ordered the pizza margherita, which absolutely melted in your mouth. \u00a0Top it off with some Pellegrino water, you're good to go! \u00a0Absolutely a great place to go if you're in the mood for a quick snack, or if you're in with some friends to catch up over wine.",

Once you've ordered, you can see two Italian guys, in the middle of the restaurant, tossing pizza dough in the air and having fun. Loved it! The pizza looked amazing when it arrived. The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. It was thin crust, which is the best for Italian pizza, but the sauce was too saucy and made the crust slightly soggy in the middle. The flavours was good. I just wished the sauce was slightly thicker. They have lots of other options on their menu that I wouldn't mind trying next time.",

We shared two slices, one Tiramisu and one Passion Fruit Cheesecake. The Tiramisu didn't impress me at all because I could only see and taste cream and cocoa but no coffee and amaretto. The other slice was better, although it tasted nothing like your regular cheesecake but rather like Solero Exotic. As that's one of my favourite ice creams, I wasn't complaining. I also ordered a single espresso which was the best I had in a while! Unfortunately I don't know what kind of coffee they use.I'll probably go back to try their savoury offers next time.",

Also the price included a glass of wine.The place is jam-packed, so expect a queue to pay at the buffet line.

Everyone else looked like their service was great, but ours was terrible, so I have to rate them down.The food was good, I had eggs and tomatoes (low carb) and it was basically perfect, the eggs and salmon and the Princi breakfast also looked really good (though they were out of sausages by lunch on a Sunday, so my friend got extra bacon, which would really annoy me...)The atmosphere was good on our side (the more casual side), very relaxed and pleasant, though on our table our \"neighbors\" cycled about 4 times before we left... You could definitely have a kind of \"Sex and the city\" or \"Friends\" style breakfast here.So, why was the service terrible? We turned up, asked for some orange juice whilst waiting for our friend, that took ages to come. Then she arrived and we ordered food and drinks, that didn't come for about 30-45 minutes. Then we chased it, turns out they lost our order completely, it was another 30 minutes before we got fed. They generally didn't know where we were or what we wanted or anything, we felt kind of abandoned.Genuinely, if you're in the area, I would probably recommend going here (we originally planned breakfast club but there were insane queues, and the food isn't that good). I just can't bring myself to 4 star somewhere that I didn't have a great experience.",

Ok, so this review is turning into architecture porn, so let me comment on the food. Portions are filling and look good. Certain options like the very meaty lasagne or cheesy macaroni cheese may not do your heart valves any good but there are also salad options. Breads are fab. Really like their little cakes. If you have the room after your mains by all means try them - otherwise take some away for when the tummy's settled. Does take-aways as well.",

I've tried the thin bread with olives, one salad with roasted pumpkin and another with aubergine (really good), some pizza al taglio, the espresso macchiatto (they don't charge extra for soya!)... Everything was great, but I have to give this place 3 instead of 4 stars for two reasons. First, I find really annoying the no-queue queuing system. You never know who arrived before you or when you're supposed to be served and the result is that when it's very busy, someone will be rude or angry with you with a high probability. Second, it's usually so crowded that eating here becomes a stressful and unpleasant experience. Either you wait ages until you find a table, after fighting with someone for it, or you eat standing anywhere, with your coat on and everything. I know this is not Princi's fault, but still it's something that influences my opinion of the place. Oh, and I've also tried the tiramisu and the passion fruit cheesecake. I didn't like the last one, which was very disappointing given all the rave reviews about it. Tiramisu was fine, but overall I think the desserts are a bit pricey for what they are.",

Everything is golden brown and oh-so-delicious looking. If you manage to walk past the window here without going in then you must be a saint!The eating area consists of high polished limestone tables and seating blocks, the lighting is a soft yellowy glow and uplit water features line the back walls giving a tranquil, shimmering hue to everything. It's very New York and the food is more Italian-American being slightly heavier than traditional Italian baked offerings, add that to the Asian inspired decor and you have a three way that works pretty well together.There are always big chunks of cake to taste on the counter at lunchtime so you can nibble away whilst you wait in the mildly hectic serving system (there's no queuing, just grab someones attention), but when you do manage to, the staff are all friendly and comply with all my irritating questions such as, \"Which is the nicest cake? Should I go for the chocolate brownie or the chocolate and walnut square? Or would you recommend the pear tart?\" even though I've just had ten minutes to decide. The problem here is that there's just too much choice and it all looks amazing!",

    "text": "Okay, so the desserts here aren't incredible for what they cost, but the service is amazing enough to make up for it.My friend and I came to Princi after failing to find the Patisserie Valerie in SoHo. We'd seen it buzzing with customers when we went to Eathai a few weeks ago, so we figured it must be good. The place was once again packed, but we managed to squeeze our way in. The first time we entered we surveyed the options (all of which looked amazing, but a tad bit on the expensive side), surreptitiously grabbed a few pieces of bread, and left quickly so we could find dinner first. When we returned, the people at the door (bouncers? security guards? hosts?) recognised us and waved us inside with a good-natured, \"Back again?\"While we painfully tried to decide what to get, one of the guys behind the counter came up to us and started speaking Italian to me. I was caught off guard, After attempting to respond using my limited Italian (ciao, grazie, and scusi), he switched to English and asked me what I felt like eating, if I needed any help, where I was from, whether I'd been to Italy, etc. He recommended the cake with the peaches and the chunks of cake on top (I don't remember what it was called), which my friend ended up getting. I spent a long time deliberating over my choice, finally choosing the pear chocolate cake. After paying, I wandered back over to my friend, who was chatting with another one of the servers behind the counter. He kept trying to tell her she should have gotten the brownie, but she wouldn't have it and insisted that the pistachio/fruit mousse thing looked way better. He flatly told her he was wrong, and then told us he would prove his point by letting us try the brownie. We figured he would cut out two small sample pieces, but no -- he gave us an entire brownie AND a cannoli (which I'd been eying) that he reluctantly switched for one of the mousse things after my friend said she wanted to try it. As he handed our free baked goods over the counter, he jokingly warned us eating them would make us fat. At this point, we were so thrilled by the fact that we'd received \u00a38 of free food that we giddily thanked him, told him he was amazing and that we'd visit the south of Italy sometime (he scoffed when I told him I'd visited the north), and promised we'd return. On our way out, the bouncers/security guards/hosts/whatever laughed at our flailing and bid us a cheerful goodbye. Needless to say, we'll definitely be back.(Oh, and the food was great. The baked goods were all light, moist, and delicious. Probably not worth \u00a34, but oh well. Also, if they have bread in a basket out on the counter, try some. It's amazing.)",

Food wise, there's plenty of selection and with good quality baked goods and a small number of hot means, is a nice choice yet it's priced somewhere beyond a cafe, but is too frenzied to make it an enjoyable place. I'd rather just take the food to go and sit in a park rather than fight for the tablespace that everyone else seems to want to endure just to eat there.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Princi, though as much for the aesthetics as for the food and drink. It's definitely one of my favorite places to grab a light lunch or a coffee in the West End. I love Princi's concept of a trendy Italian bakery, serving freshly made pastries, antipasti buffet, pizza, coffee and drinks. It's essentially a cafe. You order what you want at the counter, pay and go sit down, no waiter service. As far as I know, the whole concept is a first in London, but I expect it to be mimicked extensively going forward. \u00a0Everything is beautifully presented, as is the whole restaurant itself, with great use of lighting, glass cases and even a water feature (though I think they've taken this out now). The food itself is great though I've tended to stick to the pastries and pizza and can't comment too much on the salads. Other Yelpers have commented on the price, but I was pleasantly surprised. For central London and for such a popular place, I would have expected Princi to charge more. You can get out of here with a coffee and pastry for under 7 pounds, which I think is reasonable.My only complaint are the crowds. Princi seems to be almost permanently packed, making it difficult to just stop by and find a seat. I would go here much more if I could only get a table!",

I've had a spectacular piece of chocolate torte, good millefoglie, really good asparagus pizza, and consistently great cappuccinos. The decor is sleek and fashionable (although a little sparse on seating when it gets busy).",

It's definately worth a visit, but do know in advance; it's a loud, bustling, fast paced quick serve restaurant. You place your order at the counters and then go find a seat. At 3:40 in the afternoon, it was BUSY. I almost forgot I was in London for a moment too - the employees had thick Italian accents (which I suppose is a good sign for an Italian place).There is SO much to choose from on the menu, make sure you come hungry or with friends so you can try a few different things. If you get caught with your mouth open, salivating over all the tasting pastries cakes and sweets, you better be ready when they ask what you want to order.I tried two side salads - the Chicken Garbanzo and Pumpkin Ricotta for just 6 pounds.They were delicious. This is the kind of place you'll have to come visit more than just once so you can try a few different things. I know I'll be back.Tip: They are open late and serve great, coffees and teas!",

She called it the ghostbuster sandwich. I loved it. Princi now make a ghostbuster sandwich filling just like my mum's. They add avocados to the mix too. Tastes great. Go get some with some slices of in house freshly baked bread. Goddamn it's good. The pizza's are also amazing but be careful when choosing your slice as some have no tomato sauce and can be a bit dry. If you really must \u00a0have a sauceless pizza then get some tomato and mozzarella salad as an extra.The portions are ridiculously humungous. The decor is fantastic, exactly the same as the Princi's in Milan darling. Love everything about this place. Go there now! Oh yeah and get the fresh oj mmmm",

This is the major problem with Princi. Lovely restaurant, good food but lack of space. This is why I'm only giving it 4 stars rather than 5 stars.I have been there a few times and I have to say their food is very delicious, unlike many other Italians I've been to. I still have to try their dessert/cakes. I've been told on a numerous occasions how delicious they are but by the time I finished my main dish, I was too full to order any cakes/desserts. Their gnocchi and pizza are my favourites! It is not like any other pizza you get. I've never been a fan of pizza since the day I was born (yes I am odd) but I do admit I love their pizza at Princi. This must being saying something!I think the price is definitely value for money especially witht he size of the portion...! A definitely must try but avoid Saturdays as it gets very busy!",

High noise levels and difficult seating normally cost a place significant stars in my book, but the fact that you know what you're getting into when you walk in the doors means I can't fault Princi for being what it so obviously is - a loud, cafeteria-like restaurant, serving relatively inexpensive Italian fare with a swish streak.Not to mention, I'm still addicted to those green olive breadsticks.",

That was after I perused the salads, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, etc. The whole stretch of the counter is filled with baked goods. The atmosphere is really cool too -- clean, angular layout with wide open spaces, a lot of marble/stone surfaces, and easy lighting. The bathrooms have incense lit around them.

    "text": "I liked Princi when it first opened, but, after the bank holiday weekend, I have now decided it's not a place I'd really recommend, seeing as this place annoys me more than it delights these days. First, there's the whole seating issue. It's hard to get a seat if you're in a group larger than two people. Second, there's the whole lack-of-queueing system, which makes it hard to figure out whether you're being rude when trying to get served, not to mention the propensity of staff to serve anyone speaking Italian first, regardless of where they are in the non-queue. Third, most of the food isn't kept warm. There is the warm counter (so to speak) where the lasagne and pasta is served, but the rest of the food isn't kept warm. It's not a big problem for most of the food, but the pizza was decidedly difficult to eat lukewarm. I'm not sure why it was even shortlisted by Time Out as being one of Central London's best pizzas. Fourth, for an Italian place, the coffee really isn't that good. Maybe I'm more used to Australian Flat Whites and the like, but the coffee here was rather on the milky side. I've had much better coffee in Rome. Yes, the restaurant/cafe's kind of posh - like an upmarket Brek - and the food's affordable, and it's a quick option if you just want a snack or three to grab, but, all in all, the not-great service and the lack of seating means this place just gets three stars from me.",

Stand in one line to point out the pastry you want, then pay, then take your tray to the next counter to get your coffee (which incidentally took a curiously long time), then find a spot among the bank of seating with high stools next to strangers also eating off of trays...While the croissants were some of the best I've had in London, it was challenging to get comfortable here. \u00a0And if I want to eat food served on a tray, I'll go to McDonalds.",

All of the baked goods are neatly arranged and look amazingly appetizing. But unlike cute desserts that don't taste like anything, the pastries at Princi are incredible. There are also pizzas and breads for those not looking for a sweet fix. I'd have to categorize making a final decision on which dessert to order as one of my biggest life decisions to date. I had a ricotta cheese tartlet and it was just so smooth, creamy, and not overbearingly sweet. Paired with an espresso, I was in heaven. The interior is very modern, with stone tabletops and little fountains. It was so nice to sit down at the bar area to relax and enjoy everything. It's definitely the place to go with a friend or two and meet up for dessert and coffee.",

    "text": "Good atmosphere, but somewhat hit or miss on the food... still the only place we went twice while in London.While walking through SoHo on our way back from dinner, Diner in Crime (DINC) spotted this little bakery stuffed full of people, even though it was well past 10pm. Intrigued, we stopped in to see what all the excitement was about. Imagine our surprise to discover a full Italian bakery with every sort of delicious eats you could want.On our first time through we went straight for desserts, which sadly turned out not to be the best choice for me. While DINC was very happy with her chocolate mouse thing, my experimental zabaglione based dessert turned out to be a bit of a bust. But we still loved the experience and the ambiance so much that when presented with an opportunity to return two days later, we jumped at the chance.This time we were there for lunch, and picked up some pizza on focaccia bread. While the toppings were of high quality and quite tasty, my particular piece had low topping \"coverage\" and so turned out to be mostly bread. The bread was good, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't pizza.So, why -- you may be asking -- am I giving four stars to a place that had two disappointing items? Because we finished our second outing with a cherry and ricotta cheese dessert that was simply out of this world. Had it been the only thing I ate there, this would be a solid five star review.Which is all to say, go there, get the cherry and ricotta thingy, and if you are tempted to get the pizza, be sure to ask for the piece with high topping density.",

They have these guys in suits standing outside to greet you but they give me the feeling of Mafioso bouncers or something. Anyhoooo, we came to buy some dessert but honestly the place must be known for their main dishes and not dessert because the dessert was at most 2 to 2.5 stars. The ambiance, decor, and scene was really key and we did not even sit in. I think it is worth at least a visit or two to try the main dishes but I don't think I would give their desserts another chance. They get 3 stars total instead of two because of the decor and ambiance.",

My vongole was good, though I did wish they had bigger portions. The other girls seemed to like their pizzas. They had a reasonable selection of wine as well, ranging affordable to more pricey. Service was overall good. They did get my order wrong initially, but they were nice about it and brought out my correct order in about 15mins time. Things got busy toward the end of the evening, but I felt they were relatively on top of topping up our water, taking our requests, etc. Not a bad service for the price and busy-ness. Ambience was very casual and at times, noisy. But so long as your expectations are set, not a bad place to go for casual food and drinks.",

    "text": "Wardour Street is one of my favourite spots on Londons food map and following last weekend, it just got even better.Looking for a relaxed brunch spot on a rainy day I thought a bakery/pizzeria must be the answer. Upon entering the visitor is welcomed by a long display of baked produce and a smiling member of staff eager to find a seating spot for the guest. And that is not an easy task - the place is usually pretty crowded and no wonder, really, given the quality of food and central location. Wanting to sample the bakery bit first I went for the Pistachio Girella, only to find out that these were sold out and the regular girellas were the only ones left. They were not disappointing but I already had pizza on my mind so having decided on Pizza Vesuvio I took a look around. Princi is has quite a nice vibe to it - the decor is minimal with the colour and material palette resembling mediterranean aesthetic. I was seated against a wall but that was actually nice as there is a water rill running through the entire length of the wall fed by metal taps protruding from the wall. The sound of splashing water creates a nice vibe and softens the large volume of noise. Talking about aesthetics I have to mention the toilets - nice touch, Princi. Right, back to my pizza. Vesuvio arrived beautifully sprinkled with radicchio (italian chicory - looks a bit like red cabbage) giving it a pleasant, gourmet look. The toppings included pieces of beef ragu and also olive, fior di latte and black pepper. I prefer my pizzas low in fat so the choice of beef was not spot on but still not at all disappointing. The flavours played well together, softened nicely by fior di latte.A pleasant accent was provided by the lovely waitress distributing amongst the guests pieces if focaccia (drowned in olive)Princi is altogether a relaxed, contemporary Italian eatery that delivers a proper quality without too much fuss. I liked it!",

We were only craving the pizza so we made a beeline for their selections. There's an open counter where you can order the pizza available, you go pay and choose your seats. Definitely not table service here. What service we did gte was a bit miffed.We chose the four cheese pizza and pepperoni & cheese pizza plus diet coke for beverage. Was a little pricey for such small selections but we were hungry. We found seats by their water feature dining wall area, rather than sit at the share tables with the crowds. Because it was so busy still at lunchtime on a Thursday.The pizza slices were large and yummy but not amazing. My partner loved them more than I did so he ate the rest of mine. I would still much prefer to try this place for breakfast but it'll have to be next time we're in town.",

The Princi in London is exactly like their Milan locations - the goods and the bads. You can choose between self-serve or full serve and I would recommend the latter to access their amazing menu. Just like in the Milan location you'll deal with a slightly strange staff and a weird ordering and seating system. Bare with it because their food is worth the confusion. If you want to do it right, start the meal with zucchini fries & an aperol spritz and then end it off with a tiramisu. Vegetarians - try the spaghetti with burrata - it's really damn good. Come here if you're feeling patient and ready to have some of the best quality Italian products served up in the best way. If they could up their service and organization in the restaurant I would up my review to 5 stars in a heartbeat!",

Well fellow Soho-ians look no further than Princi Princi is yet another cheeky restaurant endorsed by Alan Yau, that nauuuughty chap behind Wagamama, Busaba Eathai and Hakkasan. Princi is opposite Busaba Wardour Street. According to the lady in there, Big Alan has hooked up with Rocco Princi, and is sometimes called 'the Armani of bread'. The result is this sharp Italian bakery. The decor is cool, the prices are too. With a wide variety of breads, pizza slices, pastas, cakes and pastries there is enough choice for \u00a0everyone regardless of hunger level. There's also an abundance of samples lying around, so get your fill before you buy. There's a great atmosphere in there and the staff enjoyed (I think) a good banter about what they can suggest for the late-night patron. I can recommend the ham and cheese ciabatta (\u00a34.00) which is not only delicious but super filling too. If you come away feeling guilty, thatr's probably because you have indulged in one of the incredible looking desserts on display. Go on, why not... You're not driving.  Princi gets devastatingly busy at lunchtime and is equally busy when I wander in there after a few beverages round 9. Having said that though.... where in Soho doesn't? Why are you still reading this? Go fill up on Princi immediately. Sexy Rob - twitter.com/RobOrme",

I bought a slice of pizza (more like melted cheesy goodness on a chunk of focaccia) and a coke, and while the system seems a bit confusing (WHERE IS THE QUEUE?!) the food and environment is quite nice.If you're looking to go somewhere where you can be waited on - do not come here.If you're hoping to go somewhere where you can sit and talk to you friend over a cocktail, glass of wine, juice, pasta, pizza, cake, biscuits or a loaf of delicious freshly baked bread - DO come here.My pizza was room temperature (so, a bit on the chilly side) but I'm assuming this is what's to be expected with this place.If you wanted piping hot food, you'd go somewhere else, eh?It's casual, the food is good, the prices are low - what's not to like?",

    "text": "Are you hungry post the Soho night out? This italian pastry shop in its simple modern design is worth visiting. 5 of us enjoyed standing by the stone-look trash bin while sharing pistachio cakes and espressos. On Sunday mornings, Princi is also a good place to hang out watching people, pastries, wood logs, when it's not that many people, you can actually hear the wall water fall. It's also a cozy place where seats are quite close with each other, good for casual 1st dates :)Most visitors eye on the glowing deserts, although the shop also has a very good selection of breads fresh out of the wood oven. Their hours are quite good, 7am-midnight, Sun is at 9am-10pm, to cater your needs. I feel so hungry now... Thanks to John B.'s initial introduction.",

Part bakery, part cake shop, part salad bar, part hot food bar and part coffee bar. Run by all Italians, recommended by Italians. Part of a chain from Milan. I've come for lunch and snacks. Good coffee - as one would expect from an Italian place. Yummy looking cakes ( a bit expensive I think so I haven't tried any, but I love the little pastry rolls filled with ricotta - kind of like canolli but made from croissant-like pastry, don't remember what it's called but its \u00a30.80). Great salads, great pizza, great bread. Can't go wrong really.",

I had a slice of margarita pizza and thought that it tasted great -- the amount of cheese was perfect and tomato sauce was very bright. The design of the restaurant is very attractive with lights submerged under running water with their beams shining up the walls. The massive display of pizza, salad, and desserts is impressive and makes selecting just one thing nearly impossible. I doubt I will be back due to the effort of jostling for seats and the steep prices.",

I used to work in Soho a few years back and was always seeing new food places open up and close again, for some units, the turn over seemed to be pretty high. However, yesterday on my travels, I found Princi and for some reason I feel that this place isn't going anywhere for a while!I was immediately intrigued by how busy and bustling the place was. People were lured in by the cakes, pastries and biscuits on sale, displayed beautifully may I had.The choice is tremendous but in the end I went for the walnut brownie and took home some tiramisu, both tasty, the tiramisu was gorgeously light and fluffy.This seems like a great place to hang out for a quick shopping break or two convene with friend, it's got a really friendly atmosphere and a brilliant vibrancy to the place.",

Princi serves a range of different Italian goodness, from simple bakery fare including cakes and all the sweet stuff to salads and lasagne and really good coffee. Everything I've had has tasted fantastic and everything I haven't had is on the list - there really isn't much in there that I don't like the look of. The tables are set respectfully back from the busyness around the counters and up against the wall on the far side there are little fountains and a bit of a marble look going on. For a total show off it's got a really good vibe and is definitely worth a trip as it brings something new to Soho and bored taste buds alike.",

The two words that immediately come to mind when I think of Princi are cafeteria and chic. Although the two words are considered antonyms, they perfectly describe this laid back and visually tantalizing Italian bakery, pasta and salad bar... where you can mix and match any combination to your liking. Aside from the sleek design of Princi, which features marble and a melodious fountain trickling alongside the bar stool seating area. The staff is attentive and courteous, often presenting patrons with free offerings of focaccia bread and pizza slices. I recommend trying the white chocolate pistachio mousse, the prices are reasonable at around \u00a32.80 per dessert and the taste is extraordinary! You don't have to travel to Milan to satisfy a craving for the exquisite tastes of Italian cuisine.",

Watching the staff bake the bread in the fire oven is amazing. \u00a0 If you at all love baked goods you are eventually going to have to venture inside.When we went all we had were the desserts and some coffee but they were pretty special desserts, it has to be said. Since there were a few of us on this culinary adventure, we decided to each get a cake and share them. It is safe to say that we were on a sugar high when we left. \u00a0The prices weren't too bad for London and once you figured out the ordering process it was fairly straight forward too. The only real downside I would say is that it was amazingly busy and I have to say that I have never walked by the place when it wasn't heaving. Which meant, that we were never actually able to sit down. We had to stand at a standing table the whole time and frankly were lucky to get that.I would go again but would hope for a time when it was a little less busy.",

When I first walked past this shop, I actually stopped and backtracked to look through the shop window.Look closely though for it is a shop of many layers. What caught my eye initially were the luscious looking desserts and cakes. Then I wandered in to continue my perusal to find that there were also salads and hot items like pizza from a wood fired oven. Finally there's a \u00a0bar area and for me, the wonderful news that they serves watermelon juice, a personal favourite.The food is Italian in origin and style and beautifully presented on the trays behind the glass counters. Everything looks very appetising but so far, I've only eaten their desserts, which have gone down well.The popularity of the place is reflected in lack of seating everytime I've been there but the sweet creations taste just as good eaten while wandering down Wardour Street.If Princi was a woman, she'd be Megan Fox!",

I came here with my husband for a lovely dinner to celebrate my bday, was disappointed as I wanted to eat fondue but it was fully booked, therefore we ended up at Princi, and let me say, this place did everything the right way! We were greeted nicely and we were directed to a waiting area while waiting for our table and was given the wait time will be 10 mins and it took less than that! Which is a +!. So we order our drinks which are one Americano and one Bellini, both got a strong kick but good! So I do recommend it. For food, my husband ordered the calzone and I ordered linguine vongole, everything were fresh and delicious, and oh boyyy they don't lay low on the cheese for the calzone! It was so deliciousssss and cheeses! The pasta? Very garlicky! Lovely! Oh oh oh, and for started we pick the classic bruschetta, yum! We ended the night with a small piece of cake, peach tart! I would definitely recommend this place, not too expensive and very down to earth! Try it!",

Having made crossaints from scratch before, I have a true appreciation for how much work went into making that pastry so incredibly flaky and layered. The service is fast, there were a lot of people standing around but the attendants behind the counter were incredibly attentive and very efficient at serving everyone -- especially since there was no formal line, there were people just standing all up and down the counter. It's a beautiful little spot, tons of seating and the perfect place to start your day with a coffee and breakfast/morning pastry. I can't speak for the atmosphere/food after breakfast time but I will *absolutely* be back next time I'm in town every day for my morning coffee.",

Seriously? After 20 minutes and getting tired of waiting, I decided to just get a table first. I accidentally went to the restaurant side of Princi and so when they gave me the menu, I thought I should just order from here.I waited for the linguine vongole for a while, around 15 minutes, so I was a bit pissed. Luckily, the pasta was incredibly delicious. You can taste the perfect combination of the olive oil, garlic and white wine. It was a feast in my mouth. The clams were also really well-cooked. I loved the food and the waiter was also super friendly, so that's why this place deserves 4 stars. The place looks pretty fancy, even with the takeout express pizzas, pastas, salads and foccacias. Hope they work on their ability to manage the wait. Would definitely come back next time. Hopefully, the ravioli & spinach will be there!",

I rushed to explain to the person at the counter, Caroline, who happens to be the manager. Her first words were \"that's impossible\". She did not apologize until she saw my sister was trying to clean the blood from her foot. There were several tiny shards of glass that were stuck in her foot (see photo). My sister had to remove the glass as it kept breaking up inside the wound herself, with no concern shown from Princi's employees. When we showed the manager where it happened she and her colleague found larger pieces of glass on the floor. She said that a glass was broken on the floor the day prior, which is telling how well the floor had been cleaned, much less \"impossible.\"I was was shocked at the attitude of the manager and also her colleagues who kept saying to wait or speak with someone else when I asked for a plaster/bandage for my sister. It's shockingly bad service that does not seem acceptable for such an establishment. No one seemed to care that my sister had a piece of glass stuck inside her foot and was bleeding, much less provide prompt help. I love the food here but I would avoid this place. I as the client had to tell Caroline that it was dangerous since it's summer and many people wear sandals which she should normally be aware of. Please improve the attitude and service of the people who work here to make sure clients feel safe and reassured when there is an issue. Caroline did state that she did what she could by providing plasters, however with an attitude, disbelief and impoliteness that does not have place in such a restaurant. Please note that she took one of the shards of glass that was inside my sister's foot and then promptly brushed it again on the floor. Not only could someone get hurt again by the glass but since it had blood on it of course it is not hygienic....",

Overall, the place is very nice and the service is good. I would definitely recommend this place for a breakfast or if you're craving pastries and croissants",

All of the pizzas are as is. Literally - what you see is what you get. The slices are not warmed up for you but it seems like the norm here in London. The dough was so fluffy and chewy. We both really enjoyed it and dipped a lot of the crust in olive oil and vinegar. Dessert - there is a good variety. I went with the tiramisu since it is one of my all time favorite desserts and I thought it was average if not below average. It's one of those places you would stop at if you were nearby and wanted a quick bite but nothing you would go out of the way to get to.",

    "text": "Had a very late lunch and needed a quick late night snack/dinner. I saw this place was open until midnight on Google so I went to check it out at around 11:10 pm. Turns out they close at 11:30 so understandably they weren't preparing any more 12\" pizzas. I grabbed a couple from behind the counter along with the large box of salad option. Between the roasted pumpkin with ricotta, tomato pesto, and a prosciutto with mushroom, the roasted pumpkin with ricotta cheese was the favourite but as a cold slice, it wasn't much. As for the salads, I had four (up to four options for a Large box). Wasn't a huge fan of the pesto pasta salad, but the roasted veggies were pretty good. The caprese was okay as well but it was similar to what I could get at my local grocery store back home. I would stick with the roasted vegetables. The fennel salad was disappointing and I thought the flavour was muted down. Service was fine. Quick and relatively friendly. Only thing is that the girl helping me dropped one slice of pizza (in a bag) on the ground behind the counter and then toppled the entire bag of all my pizzas and salads over when trying to hand it to me. Felt a little clumsy and lacking of care. I suppose it was the end of the night and she must've wanted to go home.I may be inclined to come back for some of their desserts. They look divine. I think had I been more impressed with their by the slice pizza, I would've given them a full 3 stars. We have some pretty amazing places for by the slice pizzas back home though and it's much cheaper than $24.xx pounds for the equivalent to what I got. I could only give this place a solid 2-2.5 stars based on what I tried.",

They rotate out the salad selections often, and there is a mix of straight veg (broccoli and green beans, beets, dressed salad greens) to the heartier options like chickpeas and mozzarella cubes, tuna or chicken mixes, salmon and quinoa, etc. The price points are also fair, for a half salad running about \u00a34.50 and the full salad about \u00a38 depending on the lunch or dinner session.They also have a selection of hot foods as well as sandwiches, breads, and pretty pastries. You order at the counter like a true cafeteria, then pay at the end of the row, and pick your seat. There's bar seating and communal tables, making for a very open and friendly atmosphere. There's also a fresh juice bar, cocktails, and your standard espresso-based drinks. Great for a late night bite to eat since they're usually open till around 11-1130 in Soho, and the place is bustling. Just know toward the late evening, they run out of salad options, so you may be stuck with only a few choices to fill that dinner plate. An efficient business model, they keep the place clean and tidy, and feeling very upscale even though it is a cafeteria-like in and out order-eat-and-go process.",

Ordered a slice of pear and chocolate cake, was a nice mixture of pear cubes and ganache. Cheese cake with berry jams tasted a little different from common cheese cakes, the cheese flavor was stronger, but quite nice. Really liked the decorations and the big space.

Baked aubergine can be one of the tastiest dishes in the world, certainly it is not here. Oh and by the way- it is all cold just so you know.The vulture culture of trying to grab a seat can also be a little perturbing, initially in securing a place for yourself and dining companions, and then in maintaining it once the crowds begin to encircle you. At peak hours don't expect to be able to sit and chat once you hav finished up unless you can successfully ignore the glare of those onlooking with food-laden trays cantilevering over your head...",

It has nothing to see with Paul's bread -the french bakery-, very hard to chew. The pasta is nice as well (I tried Boscaiola style, with ham and peas). There are also traditional lasagnas and cannelonni - mozzarella/tomato salad, very fresh. The pastries are square-shaped and good (passion fruit, chocolate-amaretto, tiramisu, pear flan) for only \u00a33.50.

After walking past Princi countless times salivating at their selection of cakes and pastries, I go and choose a cake which is essentially just three inches of cream. Don't get me wrong, I like cream but this had promised to be an Eton mess assembly with tiny layers of meringue and fruit too. Although the central layer remained, the bottom and top were missing (some other lucky customers must have got a bonus sugar rush). How sad. Fortunately, my friends' cakes all fared a little better and they're far too polite to stop me diving in with my fork. I'm not sure any of them tasted quite as good as they looked though and the pretencions surroundings put me off Princi a little. Where's the need for a wall of water? It just made me need the toilet. Still, if you're a fan of freebies, Princi is the place to visit. Baskets of olive bread and foccacia sit along the glass displays welcoming you to dive in. The man in front of me saw this as quite the challenge, and packed his cheeks full like a hamster. Very attractive...",

    "text": "Waaaaooooh, the food is good in here. Damn good. So good it makes me hungry just thinking about it. Popped in here recently after gazing lustfully for weeks, nay months. Finally managed to get some time and eager buddies to come and sample the delights with me. I went for the millefeuille, which was creamy, nutty and fruity and just absolutely delicious. A friend went for the chocolate and pear tart, which was just yummy though his unfortunate luck to get a tiny bit of pear on his portion... Pizza and cheesecake were also on our menu and we were so happy with our food, we grabbed some salad for dinner. Which was just so so nice, the mozzarella had so much flavour and just melted perfectly... Trouble with Princi though is the seating, it would be fantastic if you could actually sit or not have to fight for a seat or indeed a standing pillar to rest your culinary delights on. The olive bread was amazing though and according to my friends, Princi is a chain in Milan, so perhaps more of them may pop up in the future...",

But a few days ago, I finally went there with an Italian friend. She made me try Arancini \u00a0basically fried rice balls with a meat and tomato filling. Delicious! I also tried a pizza slice and was a bit surprised, as it was colder than I expected. But it also tasted good, even sort of cold.I really like the interior of Princi. Some wood, some natural stone, some polished surfaces. Some small water fountains with interesting light effects. All this actually makes me like this place.We were also happy enough to get a place to sit quickly, but it seems that it's often very crowded. Anyway, the food is very tasty. I also bought a bread there. Recommended.",

So, not the ideal place for a cash-strapped student. If you can look past the terrible service and that practically every mouthful costs you \u00a31, then you'll really enjoy the food. My favourite thing to take away are those almond kisses With tea in the morning and slightly warmed up, they're just perfect.",

Also, service is always a bit rough. Three weeks ago I went in for dinner and purchased several items. Of the five items I purchase, I really did not like the taste of one (which cost me about 3 quid). I took my bread up to the counter thinking I could just explain that I did not like it and have them exchange it for something else. WRONG!!!! I woman behind the counter gave me the third-degree (as if I had personally offended her). She questioned and argued with me for 3 minutes before another employee walked over and just exchanged the item for me. Haven't these people ever heard of the saying, \"customer is always right?\" In any case, this...and the other negatives listed above, have diminish my love for this place. Princi is good, but definitely NOT great.PS: \u00a0Burning incense in a restaurant??? \u00a0 Really? \u00a0Taste has as much to do with the nose as it does with the mouth...and smelling incense when I am trying to eat a pizza is the very last thing I want to do! \u00a0YUCK!",

Everything was absolutely delicious. \u00a0The pizzas have a crispy yet soft on the inside crust, the pesto and basil pasta salad was to die for, tossed with a light but tasty pesto sauce and fresh basil leaves, which was a nice twist. Princi is almost always busy, so if dining in, be prepared to wait, as its first come first serve. \u00a0FYI, the restaurant does have a small area with waiter service, but it's cool to experience the cafeteria side. \u00a0Plus you get to sample some of their more popular items as you go through the line! \u00a0Enjoy!",

On your first step inside, you are joyously welcomed by the staff. The food is absolutely delicious, and the servers are all extremely nice. One server complimented me on my outfit -- both hilarious and endearing. My only problem is that the place is really crowded, and due to that -- the lines are long. \u00a0I didn't mind, except for the fact that you sometimes can't find a spot to sit at! I also had an issue with one of my trips there -- there was a homeless man walking around on the cafeteria side and asking for money. None of the patrons said anything when I, a young girl, was being bombarded for money for near five minutes. As a young female, this was a traumatizing experience. Eventually, I was left alone and told a waiter who immediately resolved the situation. Still weird to think that you can be in a packed room and no one will help you....",

On balance, I'd advise you to try to get a table at Pizza Pilgrim, around the corner, before trying here. Difference being that Princi seats probably three times as many, so you're far more likely to actually get in immediately here than at a hipstery shoecloset. It feels like it was a retail unit in a previous life, so it's all a bit light and big. The lack of intimacy is offputting.Four-star pizza, two-star everything else.",

    "text": "The spread is mesmerizing that's for sure. First thing you see from the door is a hypnotizing spread of moist cakes and juicy tarts and piles of cookies. All the way back to the cashier you're met by all sorts of flatbreads and pizzettes, at least 3 cases full of something bready, cheesy, tomato-y with different toppings. (They often put out samples of their pizzettes and flatbreads, the extras from the oven, so you might even get full off of a few samples if you time your arrival just right!) As a concept its very enticing... go down the line, pick up your bready goodness with a few cold sides (beet salad, broccoli rabe, these types of things) or head straight down to the back where they seemed to have hot dishes ready for plating. Cashier is there too, and then you better fight for a table because once you've plunked down there's no one pushing you out the door and you can linger in the smooth space for a good amount of time. For dinner this is a nice balance of casual and still 'swanky' enough to call it a night out.As nice of a place this is to visit, I wasn't blown away by the food itself. The samples I had were pretty good, in that it was cheese and bread, but honestly not that hard to mess that combination up. The pasta I had was way too salty, so much so that I ended up eating the mushrooms and throwing the bulk of the linguine out. And the desserts are beautiful, often interesting combinations, but the flavors don't really come together. Appearances can be deceiving. I would go back... but mostly to gawk.",

    "text": "Alan Yau has created some of my favorite restaurants in London so when Princi happened to be on my nostalgic walking tour of my old town it was the perfect place to stop for lunch. It's nothing like the other restaurants on Wardour street. \"Sleek Milan hotel\" just about describes it. It's very casual communal table seating inside but still very chic and cosmopolitan. There's a seated pizza place on the left and the buffet is on the right. You just go up to the buffet counter and let the staff know what you want. They'll put it together, reheat the food and you just pay at the cashier as you pick up your tray of food. The pizza's are okay (less than \u00a35 a slice). The real stars are the dessert so be sure to save lots of room for them. We got the peach & pistachio cake and zuppa ingress (super rich and filing). Afterwards we were satiated until dinner. Couldn't even consider an afternoon snack even though we ended up walking over 10 miles.Next time I would skip the lunch and just come here for afternoon tea.Approx \u00a320 for lunch included two pizza slices, two desserts and a coffee.",

He shows you were to wait in line to have your name taken for a list for a table. This is a convoluted process, and causes a clump of people to essentially block off part of the restaurant, standing awkwardly against one wall in the hopes that the head waiter (presumably?) will notice them.We waited roughly 40min for a table for three, and ended up with window counter seats, which were fine, except that the counter is polished brass and the pendant lights cause a glare right into your eyes. Seriously ow.Our first round of wine came with bits of cork in it. Not ok. Appetizers were staggered: two of us got food, one of us waited. The same happened with the mains, but to an even worse degree: two of us got our pizzas and the third came out 30min later because of some temperature issue with an oven (which sounds like a convenient excuse for \"we dropped/forgot your order\". That meant two of us sat there letting our pizza get stone cold so the third wasn't staring at us stuffing our faces while her stomach rumbled.The highlight of the meal was the olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with the bread (which you have to order, where most places will give you a bread selection gratis), which were of exceptional quality.Service was spotty and understaffed. And the bungling of the order pacing was just unacceptable at this price point, for which the food didn't make up.Skip.",

Today, I had a chicken and roasted parsnips and sweet potatoes and honestly cannot remember time when I got excited about eating chicken. This plate was full of flavour and juiciness! My girlfriend's plate of four different salads were so delicately different and vibrant - aubergine with tomato kind of salsa, beetroot & goat cheese and some mysterious items.. Ocean of super tasty healthiness in my mouth.Disappointment came with the favourite part of meal - the desserts.. My girlfriend said that my dessert tastes like armpits; Hers was this enormous pile of over sweeten clotted cream in three thin pastry layers. In fact, both of the desserts seemed like they are trying to beat a World record in amount of sugar in a piece of cake.Thing which must be mentioned is the restroom. Large individual room, luxuriously and really clean looking, smelling of incense helped me to get over the dessert disaster rarely fast..So would I recommend this place for a date or weekend relaxed meeting with friends? Probably not. It really doesn't give the chance to relax and slow down properly (AND enjoy the dessert), but it is amazing place to go to for a lunch break or a quick bite.",

Princi is somewhere I've gone past on several occasions but only recently stopped into for a fantastic coffee and canoli.We ate in the food-displaying side (on the right as you go in), which seemed to be the drop-in area. The macchiato was fabulous, with the fruitiness of the coffee coming through (surely the sure sign of a good roaster). The canoli was fab: sweet and creamy, firm yet crumbly.One downside is that ordering is fairly convoluted, in that you have to stand near the thing you want (cake, patisserie, salad, pizza... all amazing) and get the attention of someone serving, and hope that no one butts in in front of you. You have to then go and collect your coffees from the back, which makes coordinating slightly difficult, but not overwhelmingly so. Additionally, the water feature around the edge of the room spits out drops of water over the table area, where your food, drink, book etc is likely to be...goodness knows what's been in contact with that water. This for me is almost a deal-breaker, and I'll make sure to get a seat at the tables in the middle of the room.",

I live next door and wasn't interested in going far for dinner, so we headed to Princi. It was a Monday night of a bank holiday weekend, so they were packed and everyone looked frazzled. We waited for a few minutes in the line to get our names down and asked how long it would be. The woman said they were very busy, (I can see that, which is why we asked) and said, maybe 25-30 minutes. Well, its a busy night in Soho and half an hour isn't terrible so we bobbed and weaved around the people ordering at the counter and got a half bottle of wine and waited. As for the atmosphere, at first it seems nice and open and very modern, but all the tables are high and so close to each other that squeezing into a seat is a pain even without a tray of food. Anyway, we managed to snag some seat at the wall and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. They send you a text when your table is ready, so it was now 50 minutes since we put our names down, so we went back up and asked to make sure we didn't miss a text or something. The same lady then told us it would be another 15 minutes! OYE! I don't mind waiting an hour for a table, if I am told it will be an hour. She just kept saying how busy they were. Yes, I see your are busy and so you should have over estimated my wait time. We now felt like we had committed to this place, so we stayed and got seated about 15 minutes later. So our 30 minute wait was now over an hour. When we finally got seated they told us that the pizzas were backed up so they would take longer than usual too, so we settled for a couple pasta dishes. Oh, and it took us forever to get a waitress, because she was so busy chatting up the customer next to us. Then as a topper on the cake, my boyfriends pasta was undercooked and mine was literally burned - like black and stuck to the bottom of the dish it was served to me on. I was so hungry at this point I just ate what wasn't stuck to the dish. When then manager came by and asked us how things were we did say something and she offered to bring me something else, but I just couldn't be bothered at this point.I think the manager (or who I assume was the manger) stepped up and took the food off our bill, and because of her good will I'll probably be back - on a quieter night. There has to be something redeeming about this place if they have 4 stars on yelp.",
