Seemingly a chain of restaurants popping up throughout London's hottest locations.I visited on a Sunny Sunday afternoon and we walked straight into a table for 3 but I would expect to queue a little at the weekends (especially if the weather is nice).By all accounts an Australian business and the menu reflected this. A good selection of dishes, mostly salad based. Don't come here expecting a dirty burger.We started with the Korean chicken, which was pleasant enough. Certainly not the best I've ever had. That accolade is still held by Yum Jungle. Chicken was followed by more chicken in my case with the Chicken Schnitzel. A very tasty dish and very generously portioned. Presented with creamed corn to die for! A good selection of drinks available (you can never argue with Gamma Ray at lunch time!)Well priced for the quality and the size of the dish, in my opinion.I certainly wouldn't rush back here but if passing and hungry I'd definitely pop in for more of the same.",

    "text": "Walking in to Granger & Co you can feel the warmth of the atmosphere, which is quite a feat considering there's floor to ceiling windows that will 90% of the year serve to expose the grey skies and wind battered commuters passing by, yeah I'd say it's a brave move. Decor is used to enhance the shape, size and the environment of the restaurant, the mirrors above the bar reflect the skyline outside, the huge windows allow the hustle and bustle of Kings Cross in and the use of heavy brass seems to nod to the era where this area was industrial and hardy, used for trade, importing and transporting goods.The natural light provided by the glass exterior is enhanced with warmer lighting and candles when it gets a little later, allowing you to be sheltered from the noise and agitating buzz of the outside pace, yet still be amongst the movement of the city. Though the area has plenty of lush trees to keep it slightly romantic it's still very much a busy place, yet strangely when looking out upon it all from where I sat I felt more grateful for the quiet and calm surrounds. Curious logic... Or it could've been the wine.Anyway enough analysing over the decor! Though - never underestimate its importance. \u00a0Let's move on..I'd come to choose the restaurant, not only because it's new (definitely not 'cause he's an Aussie!) but I was having dinner with a couple of friends, one of whom was coming in on the train to St. Pancras and as my housemate and I live a stone's throw away it seemed silly to go elsewhere! We'd ticked off most of the restaurants in Granary Square and so naturally we moved ourselves on to new options at the newly opened Pancras Square, this was first on my list when I saw their menu!For starters you could look at the delicious calamari and presume to know it was nice, well presented and had a good amount of dressing to go, but honestly, you'd have to try it yourself to really \u00a0know what I'm talking about when I say, melt. in. the. mouth. Delicate seasoning. Two more plates please.This is a perfect example how amazing such simple food can taste when it's treated just the way it should be. Beautiful.Moving on to our mains, there was a whole lot of 'umm'ing and 'ahhh'ing over what dish might be the chosen one - the options are pretty dribble inducing. Thankfully we had the wine to keep any inappropriate behaviour at bay. Both the girls went for the yellow fish curry with spiced butternut squash, roast peanuts and cucumber relish with brown rice.I made the mistake of trying some.. Damn you food envy! This was so exquisite, layers of toasted spices making their way through the creamy coconut in the sauce, paired with the crisp and refreshing cucumber relish, the delicate yet meaty fish and deep textures of the butternut squash.. \u00a0(I might take myself back there for this dish, table for one!)Considering that I'd had Thai for dinner the past two nights I decided the gochujang braised beef shin was for me, served with charred shallots, spring onions and brown rice.Now this was something else completely and it offered up equally as much deep felt satisfaction. A hot brothy bowl of rich, meaty bone juices, which fondly reminded me of my nan giving me hot bovril in a cup with bread when I'd get home from school to warm me in the winter, and trust me when I say that's a huge compliment. This put a genuine smile on my face, it felt so wholesomely virtuous and deeply nourishing to eat.I scooped up mouthfuls at a time on my spoon, tearing bits of bits of shallot, coriander, spring onion and pulling bits of beef shin which was so soft and delicate it almost melted. It all sat beautifully in what was a rather deep spoon, leaving room for a good scoop of that amazing broth on \u00a0top of it all.. \u00a0one healthy, hearty hug of a meal.The service here was absolutely wonderful. At no point did we feel rushed, we were offered advice on wines, in depth descriptions of the dishes and then left to our own devices, during the three hours we sat there chatting our wine and water amazingly seemed topped up at all times with little or no disruption to our conversations.After we'd finished dinner, we were left to enjoy our drinks, so full",

When I asked what was going on she said her manager wouldn't like to see the offensive logo so she wanted to pour it in a paper cup. I wasn't bothered by being told I couldn't bring in coffee.

I'm not sure whether Bill has his exchange rates confused, but the prices are totally disconnected from the small portion sizes and general food quality. \u00a0Thankfully London has enough decent restaurants to allow you to avoid whatever this place has to offer. Two stars because I'm a patriotic Aussie.",

I actually wanted to try their brunch menu but the dinner didn't disappoint.Mains:(1) Soft shell crab, chorizo and kimchi fried rice with poached egg - Absolutely delicious! The rice was risotto like and the flavours made you want to immediately take another bite.\u00a315.5(2) Prawn and chilli linguini with garlic and rocket - A simple but yummy dish. Loved the linguini and light fresh flavours of this dish but the shrimp wasn't extraordinary.\u00a315.5(3) Grass fed beef burger - Was too well done so I would try the other dishes instead.\u00a314Desserts:(1) Salted caramel ice cream sundae with popcorn and roasted peanuts - I was very full at this point but this was still really good that I finished it till the very last drop.\u00a37.5(2) Chocolate ganache, passionfruit and hazelnut praline - Great dessert too. Loved the balance of flavours between the chocolate and the passionfruit, as well as the crunch of the hazelnut.\u00a36.5--voodie rating: 8.5/10\u00a330 per head",

So I travel halfway across the globe and find myself with the same assholes that I wanted to get away from. I guess I should've expected this since the Google headquarters was literally around the corner of this spot.On top of all this, the bartender downstairs forgot our food order. I knew she would forget since it was so busy and she didn't bother to write it down. When we asked about it 25 minutes later, she said she never put the order in. No apology or comp or anything.Needless to say there's little to come here for with the exception of the layout. But if a tech bro atmosphere and lousy service are what you're looking for, then have at it!",

They were so fluffy but also filling and didn't taste heavily of cheese. The butter was a honeycomb butter which I think is a thing now??? It was good all the same. The maple syrup was really nice and not too 'fake sugary' and went well with the hotcakes as well as the bananas!! I wanted to try the passionfruit soda as well, but they ran out. Instead I got the hibiscus + lime which probably ended up being a better choice, since it was such a hot day!! The drink is super refreshing and not too sweet, like hibiscus drinks usually are! The lime adds a nice tartiness to it \u00a0which again is welcome, cause it makes it all the more refreshing. I'd come back for the hotcakes even though they were so filling I couldn't finish them all, but I'd also like to try some of their savoury dishes!",

Service was quick and friendly and I almost felt like I was on holiday sat at the breakfast bar counter! It was a great seat, I could see all around the restaurant and outside. It was a sunny day and with the big windows, it lights up the space. It would have been a nice touch to have some hooks for your handbag under the counter as it was a long way down to the floor when you wanted or your phone or purse! I ordered the avocado on rye with a poached egg. It was amazing! Really tasty, it went really well with the coriander and I don't even usually like coriander! My friend went for the salmon and really enjoyed it, that was a much bigger portion that mine. Do note that if they ask you if you want toast with your meal, it is an extra and not included as part of your meal, I think it was an extra \u00a31.50 for a slice of toast. My friend and I shared a portion of hot cakes which were really tasty, fluffy and just the right thickness. It was nice to have the best of both worlds, sweet and savory without feeling too full. Although on the pricier side for your typical breakfast, I was really impressed and will definitely visit again if I have an early journey from Kings Cross.",

    "text": "Loved the vibe and food of this place. I was a bit skeptical bc it's a chain in kings x/St. Pancras and honestly it could've gone either way, but I have to say it's a decent spot.Got here at 11 or a bit earlier on a Sunday - MASSIVE queue out the door (side note: WTF is going on in this neighbourhood?! Every brunch spot has a queue out the door like they're giving food away - restaurant entrepreneurs open up more cafes in the area it's ripe for the picking!). Despite the scary queue, the nice waitress told us the wait would be about 20 mins - bearable.Not happy with this though bc it was freezing I asked about the bar seating and she said if we didn't mind the draft we could sit down right now. Done! So, because of yelp pics I knew I was getting the hot cakes, but I was trying to eat more veggies so we also got the corn fritters, a couple of coffees and a cheese and spinach scroll while we were waiting for good measure. Yes, I was hungry. Yes, it was too much.So, onto the food. The waiter messed up our hotcakes order but apologised and fixed it in a few minutes. It actually worked out bc we ate the fritters and then had he pancakes for dessert-ish. Both dishes were great and very different. Hot cakes were super fluffy and just what you want pancakes to be. Personally I thought they needed something tart to balance out the honeycomb butter and banana, maybe some berries. And some bacon.The coffee was delicious (allpress) but the milk for my americano was very cold and so my coffee got cold too fast. This happens to me all the time. Must ask for hot milk next time.To top it all off, the venue has a wonderful Art Deco/Wes Anderson vibe to it and free Sunday magazines to peruse while you wait.It's a solid spot for brunch and I'm now looking forward to trying their other meals!",

Despite the dog wearing her vest, which clearly stated she was a service dog, and us explaining that she was a medical assistance dog and allowed in restaurants under the Equality Act of 2010, we were blown off by the employee and manager and told \"pets\" were not allowed. Absolutely unbelievable and illegal! Do not support such discrimination with your patronage. There are many other amazing restaurants in London which deserve your money.

The menu, as with all granger restaurants, is full of fresh, veg filled options and lots of flavours. The food here is seriously good but I've been here a couple of times now and sometimes the menu is slightly different to what happens on the plate. But I've never been disappointed! Lots of avocado, kale, fish and eggs. And seriously good cakes. Five stars for food.Booze list is ok. Wines are Australian focused and well made. Would love to see some craft Aussie beers here as there are some great ones in London. Four pillars gin is a must try.The reason why this doesn't get 4 stars + is because the staff are sooooooo relaxed. There is no sense of urgency and you really do need to flag them down even when it doesn't seem to be that busy. You're next to a train station: people may have a limited time. Right? They also seem to be very disappointed when you break it to them that you haven't booked for your coffee or breakfast. Refills of water jugs are as common as pink zebras. Anyway I'm torn but the food is so good and coffee is excellent so I think that wins.",

The hoisin chilli sauce really brought the dish together, however, I really could've eaten double that amount! At \u00a312.50 with no meat, it was far too pricey! My friends all seemed to have the same experience; Simple, fresh dishes but we're all stingy portioned for the price we were paying.Was really excited to visit this place as I love Bill Granger's recipes and before we ate there, I was hoping there'd be a Granger and Co in Manchester soon but I can't see it catching on.

    "text": "Was this place overpriced? A tad yes. But was the food good? Hell yes! I had the chicken schnitzel and not only was it tasty it was a generous portion that left me feeling very full. I was very surprised by the selection of wine on offer - they had Australian (naturally - it is an Aussie restaurant), but also Italian and French (was also happy to see Picpoul De Pinet - which seems to be harder to come by these days). Upon arrival - it was jam packed - but I cannot express how happy I was with the service! They seated us at the bar and kept us informed about how long the wait would be for a table (which as it turned out, wasn't too long). \u00a0Everyone was so friendly despite being super packed (people were literally queuing around the corner to get in). \u00a0By the time we finished our first drink - boom! A lovely table was available. \u00a0 The waitress we had was really lovely and helpful - she was able to recommend different beers on offer, explain some of the things on the menu and was super nice. My only negative about this restaurant - they don't take reservations. But I'll definitely be back.",

The ricotta pancakes with bananas are literally heavenly, the chorizo that comes with delicious poached eggs was perfectly cooked and flavourful and any place that serves a latte with house made almond milk is something special. The service was friendly and attentive (not overly normal for London) and I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I give this place 3 stars because it's too much of a hit & miss in terms of service. The food is great though. The first time we came here for breakfast it was great, and the second time, getting served at the bar, it was awful. What's awful, you might ask? Awful is when you sit down, order a coffee and breakfast and then wait 20 minutes to get that coffee from the bar staff and your breakfast is obviously nowhere in view. Oh, and after the coffee was set in front of you, you actually wait more before you can finally sip it because they didn't think you might require sugar/sweetener. Not a pleasant service experience. On the food front, this is an Australian business and the menu reflects it with its choice of products. It's more on the healthy side.The ricotta hot cakes are simply a treat, they are perfect and come in a generous serving. Other food items looked very fresh and tasty as well. Eep in mind the prices are relatively high here for what you get, so those looking for better value won't find it here. Would we be back? Not with so many other choices around, but maybe now and again.",
