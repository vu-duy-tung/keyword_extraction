Its probably the place you visit once but if you are really struck you may use it as your local. It was 4 oclock and I was surprised to find the place empty apart from a couple of people at seperate tables. The wait for tea and coffee for 4 was 25 minutes, which I could not understand although it was worth the wait. You do get the free small saucer of Kurdish soup and a coiuple of spoons to sample and I guess if it takes your fancy you go for a full portion. to me it was a minestrone. The 3 stars are because of the toilets, not a pleasant experience, but there is a waiting room. At least I have found out where the traffic wardens hide away till the end of their shift.",

It is a charming place. We whiled away the morning to lunchtime with no pressure to go if anything to stay! It is also a deli and has a superb collection of teas which they can recommend as well as smoothies and juices. I ended up buying four boxes of different teas! I had a Kurdish soup which despite not being a soup fan (find them not filling enough) filled me completely that I regreted asking for a pitta bread. The other brother is a right charmer, giving out soup, juice and hot drink samples. If your in Camden and want to escape the bustle without ending up in a chain. This is the place if you like a middle-eatern, african design slant.",

The place is decked out in some sort of hippy arabic style that is actually quite charming. This is more a simple cafe than a restaurant. It's not a place to go with someone for a serious sit-down meal, and I didn't find the food so amazing that I am likely to cross town to try it again anytime soon, but if you are in the area this is a great place to chill-out and have a simple (but tasty) veggie meal.",

Went for breakfast but all a bit healthy for my liking so had an espresso which was one of the best coffees I have had in London - proper rocket fuel. About to leave when the lovely guy who works there told us he had prepared us a taster dish for free! Walnuts covered in delicious plain yoghurt with date syrup on top. It was like heaven. Also did the trick of keep us there longer and we ended up spending a lot on various things like a really good Egyptian hot sauce and aforementioned date syrup from Basra. He also chucked in a few free chocolates for us. Looking forward to going back and getting a falafel wrap.",

We all got together for a meeting there on a rainy morning in May and my first impression was to be very charmed by the atmosphere and the decor. Tree stump stools to sit on, a woven basket where we put our umbrellas and potted plants and herbs growing by the window. We went up to the counter presenting the food deli-style, and as my friends ordered their usual favourites, to help with my decision the guy at the counted handed over a little dish of soup for me to try, which was really veg-ful and hearty. I went for a plate piled high of salad, roasted aubergine, sprinkled seeds and a whole bunch of stuff. A full meal, just over \u00a35. I hadn't eaten anything that day until then, it was a pretty late breakfast for me, and a very satisfying, fresh and energising one too. I tried some of my friends guava smoothie, just to taste - really sweet and tasty stuff, I recommend it. We actually stayed for hours just chatting about our projects and (perhaps since it wasn't busy at all that day) no one minded at all. I'll return next time I visit the area, particularly for lunch type stuff. Check it out if you want a cute and rustic veggie experience.",

It is a small organic shop with chairs and tables outside it. At the back inside is a beautiful cafe area with tables and seats sliced from huge trees with polished rings and bark. Newspapers and cookery books are available so you can sit and read. It is the sort of place you can sit in for an hour or two undisturbed, or chat to the staff. The owner is very friendly and always offers me dried dates and figs as I leave. The best thing is the incredible hot chocolate, more like hot chocolate soup. Expensive at \u00a32.45 for a large cupful, but so wonderful it's worth it. I find it a soothing, quiet retreat from the crowds of Camden market, and I keep going back for the hot chocolate.",

Lovely on a hot day sitting outside ----- the sun perfectly hits here at lunch. Perfect for after work drinks in a chillest environment or morning coffee and a smoothie to cure a hangover.

My Village Cafe is not just about the great food, going to this cafe is an entire experience for all of the senses.It specialises in organic vegan and vegetarian food, and sells packaged products as well as freshly made hot and cold food to eat in the cafe area at the back. The tables and beams that make up the cafe area are carved from old trees, and there are all sorts of interesting lanterns and other objects hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. The interior walls have been stripped down to reveal the bricks and lovely, dark wooden shelves line the walls to display the food products. The front window has blue fairy lights draped across and fresh fruit and veg tumble down a display making it look like a harvest festival offering.Newspapers are left out for diners to have a read of whilst eating, dates and figs are given as a complement next to the till, and the exotic tea bags can be used over and over again without any extra cost. These sweet touches make you feel really at home. As for the best thing on the menu, you must try the chick pea soup. Warming, wholesome and lightly spiced, last time I was there I even heard several people complementing the chef and asking what ingredients were in it.The owner is incredible; friendly, attentive and creative (he designed the place himself) and always welcomes you with a warm and generous smile.

Salad selections, great juices and cakes to die for. It has cosy sitting area at the back and every time I brought someone in they were impressed. It is unlike any \"trendy - pretencions\" organic cafes in London, this one has a heart to it!",

A helpful patron at the table next to us even helped us map out the next couple of days of our trip! Such an adorable shop I just spent 45 minutes trying to find this place for our trip again next week, can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "LOVEThey always have a variation of what they call Grandmas Soup which is basically their soup of the day. Everything from mango carrot stew to vegan chili. Always warm and filling. I was first introduced to this place by my friend Angel who swears by their spicy mocha, and with good reason! It's the perfect combination of sweet with a kick of spice but not too much.Outdoor tables are great for people watching but not so great if you're not a smoker. The vibe in this place is always so zen. The lighting is dim, the music is relaxed. In fact, I always resent the groups of bargoers who interrupt the chill vibe by coming in and looking over the wine menu only to realize there loud group is better suited elsewhere.They accept credit cards but under \u00a310 costs you 50p. It's technically self service but they'll check on you. Free samples of soup as spicy mocha are always the best. All vegan but you don't sacrifice a thing. A relaxed departure from the bars of the area. I always find myself back here.Quote on the walk says it all.",

The dominant experience I had in My Village Caf\u00e9 was hearing a 'waitress' or 'hostess' complain about how she wasn't paid enough. You'll notie the quotes because the entire hour that I was there, she neither 'waited/served' or 'hosted'. Meanwhile, my food was slowly prepared and I was called to retrieve it from the counter, rather than being brought to me.The quality of the food was simply mediocre. I jumble of vegetarian fare was thrown onto a plate that was too small. One simply could not eat without spilling food over the side. I did not order a salad, yet that's what I received... mostly spinach and rocket, with stale hummus dumped on one side next to falafel.This place would be good near a university for students low on cash, if only the prices were halved. Otherwise, it's a venue for those seeking a bohemian atmosphere and have some extra cash to burn. The two stars are for the potato and spinach bites, which were actually good, and the interesting ambience and decor that transported one out of London. However, I'd prefer to be transported to somewhere with better food and service. I will be going elsewhere next time for a vegetarian lunch.",

It may have something to do with the vibe in that area, a lot of true hippies - people that are opposed to animal cruelty - don't mistake for hipsters, the younger generation that always know the coolest places to be. I truly think this is known to those who go looking for it, as it is away from the Camden market spectacle. Can't rave enough about the fresh juices that they offer, so many different options and then look at my falafel meal, have you ever seen anything that colourful and nutricious! If I had my way I'd lock myself here in the basement and never leave, wonderful people, wonderful food - a must go to for anyone keen on having good vegan food!",

KURDS.Well maybe not, I've never been to the border area of Western Asia and the Middle East so I am not for certain how much cheese exists there. I once I had a dream I was in these parts. I was wearing the wrong traditional hat and clothes; and everyone was laughing at me at border inspection when my little plane landed.Anyway, this Kurdish vegetarian restaurant was perhaps more interesting in an ethnographic sense - the decor was very effectively un-western in a way that appeared actually authentic. I last went here about a year ago and the servers/workers were wearing headscarfs and traditional garb, similar in a way that seemed like something that they'd wear any day of the week.But the food, the food had something left to be desired - it was cheese-filled (not printed on the menu) and jejune, I actually felt like nothing from this village came into existence outside of a plastic container at Sainsbury's. It was very, in American terms, blah.But really, I will keep in mind to ask for a falafel with no cheese if I find myself in Northern Iraq.",
