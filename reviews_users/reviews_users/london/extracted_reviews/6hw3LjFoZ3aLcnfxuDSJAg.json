    "text": "No reason to avoid the place, but don't go out of your way unless you're already at Harrod's and hankering for a pick-me-up.The scones are pretty nice, a little sweet, buttery and soft with a toasty crunch to the outside, and the service is gracious, patient and accommodating. We stayed for something like 3 hours just nibbling and sipping. It's just the atmosphere that needs some oomph. The place has kind of a cafeteria-like feel, a barrenness that is surprising given the amount of detail put into everything else at Harrod's. Its not off-putting exactly, but just not the cute cozy setting you might be hoping for with tea. That being said, on a rainy day after some moseying around the fancy department store, nothing is more appropriate than a break for cream tea!",

These scones are a little crunchy, a little crumbly and a little sweet, just the right combination for a scone. \u00a0Not too dry, but dry enough that you will welcome the Cream and Jam. Really the scone is just a delivery mechanism for the Clotted Cream. The more the better. The tea is lovely. \u00a0Everything is served on a proper china, as it should be. \u00a0You have to \"take tea\" while in London, and this is the perfect place to do it!!!",

    "text": "What a delightful little bucket list item! A friend suggested I do \"tea time\" at Harrods while visiting London and it just so happened that I happened upon the world famous department store as I was walking towards Cromwell Road. Getting to the tea room proved to be something that should be reserved for \"The Amazing race\" show, but that's only because the store is sooo big! It was almost comical how many store employees we had to ask for directions and how many times we got lost, regardless of them. I figured there would be a wait to be seated, but were able to get a 2-person table right away. Thank goodness, because after all that walking, I really needed to rest my heels. Not being tea-drinkers, we asked our server for a suggestion and in her super cool British accent she giddily said \"Oh! Most definitely the french vanilla!! It's delightful!\" She was obviously a fa - which had us sold. We also ordered crumpets, not knowing what they are (think English muffins) and not caring. When in Rome...(buy leather goods. When in England, but tea and crumpets). The restaurant itself was decorated beautifully, like a room that you'd find in Windsor Castle. I felt like royalty (or a distance offspring of it); being served our tea and crumpets on fine china with silver place settings and pot. The fancy, complimentary chocolate mints that came with our bill was a very nice touch. It was all the niceties of the tea room that made our hour long visit so incredibly enjoyable.",

We were going to go to the Georgian which was a more upscale tea room also in Harrod's, but of course it was full without reservations. It all worked out in the end since we ended up in the Tea Room which was just as nice and much cheaper compared to the Georgian.We ordered the Mayfair which was a package with choice of tea and a tower of delicious tea goodies which included scones, biscuits sandwichs and tea cakes. The jasmine tea we ordered was amazing -it had a strong jasmine fragrance and I've grown up drinking jasmine tea. The only downside was there was a bit of a wait time and I don't believe they take reservations as it's a bit more casual. But overall, I would definitely come back and recommend to anyone going to London.",

    "text": "My friends and I wanted to try English afternoon tea for the first time and decided to choose this place because they do not require reservations ever. I went here on a Sunday afternoon around 3:39 PM in a group of 8. We were seated after a 10-15 minute wait which I consider to be very quick for no reservation and a busy time. However, we were seated in the ONE awkward table they had that was a large round circle with a bouquet on top so i couldn't see my friend across from me. Looking around, however, this is the only table in the entire restaurant so it is more bad luck, but really, they should just get rid of this infuriating table.Anyways, our waitress was very kind and friendly. Most of us chose The Mayfair option which was 29 pounds for five half sandwiches, two scones, three tiny desserts of our choice, and one pot of tea from a selection. It was super filling! I would definitely say skip lunch if you get The Mayfair and you'll end up skipping dinner too. The sandwiches are absolutely delicious. The chicken one is currently floating in my dreams. The chef accidentally added roast beef to a salmon sandwich which sounds nice, but my vegetarian friend was not amused. The scones are AMAZING. With the clotted cream and jam, they will fill you right up especially if you drink your entire pot of tea. The tea fancies are actually very very tiny, but by the time you get to the third tier, you'll be so full anyway! The Lime & Pineapple dessert I had was a little too sweet and sour.However, it was still a very rewarding and satisfying experience! If they just get rid of that table, they could easily get five stars in my head.",

Scones are fresh and Large. You could really just have a scone with tea and be set. The Savories that came with the afternoon tea were also quite sweet. After it all it's just another food court.",

Upon arrival, I was informed in the most condescending tone that tea is only served in the main dining room. Not wanting to make a fuss, I don't push \u00a0the issue, but then am asked by every server I encounter whether I'm sure I want the CLASSIC afternoon tea. The waitress who brings out my tea, sandwiches, and scones is very friendly, but once she brings out the last tray of food she disappears. It then takes a full 55 minutes of asking passing servers and eventually walking up to the front desk to get my leftovers wrapped up and my check brought out. The man at the front desk (who has been wordlessly watching all this for at least 45 minutes) eventually saunters over with my check without any sort of apology. Nobody comes to afternoon tea for the overpriced finger sandwiches- at 60 pounds ($90) after \"optional\"/ not-actually-optional service fees, one would expect diners to at least be treated with basic politeness.",

The decor is very much consistent with tea time- tea cups and matching plates everywhere, beautiful soft colors and small seating areas and benches. I was in love at first sight! We went just for afternoon tea, not food, but there is a very good menu if you're looking for that. Each of us ordered a different tea and different dessert. Everything was spectacular! Tea biscuits, scones, crumpets and the chocolate cake were all so delectable, so were the teas! I had the vanilla and I couldn't stop drinking it.

People were dressed extremely casually and the ambiance of the restaurant was surprisingly loud.However, the tea, service, and food are incredible. I decided to get the afternoon tea which came with endless sandwiches, desserts, and tea, and it was definitely worth the price. I was able to get an incredible experience with my family.If a friend were to be looking for a stereotypical tea room experience with the posh vibes, I would be hesitant to recommend Harrods' Tea Room. However, for anyone who is looking for a great meal or a casual date place, I definitely enjoyed Harrods'!",

We tried the Georgian Blend tea that was recommended by our waiter and was an excellent choice that went well with sweet and savory pastries and sandwiches. I am not s butter person but the butter and house made jam with warm scones were amazing. Last year we did not have a reservation so we could not wait for an hour. But this year we had plenty of time to wait and enjoy. Next time i am going to try their lunch or dinner menu items for sure. Highly recommend this place after shopping.

The Orangery at the Kensington Palace was the actual plan but unfortunately it didn't work out due to high demand. But despite that, was determined to make it happened! \u00a0 After a couple hours roaming around Harrods, plugged my mobile into the free wifi and had Yelp guide me through to see who offers tea time with such simplistic with a bang. \u00a0 And guess what came up...Harrods' Tea Room. \u00a0Oh my Lordy, this little spot didn't disappoint at all. Wasted no time and placed my order after I waited for 5 minutes in line to be seated.Rooibos tea was my choice of drinks... has a soft and tangy flavour which combines a dry straw earthiness with a hint of bitter Seville oranges. Tip: adding brown sugar or any sugar looses the appeal of its natural bitterness.English crumpets- toasted and served with preserve ; butter and orange marmalade... delish!English tea cakes- halved and toasted; butter alone was enough to add a hint of sweetness. Fantastic...!Server was quick, attentive, and above all quite lovely, indeed! Fair pricing being at Harrods...who knew?... and yes, all the fancy China was used to truly gives you the feeling of dining with her Majesty. \u00a0Highly recommend it.Fancy a spot o' tea?",

    "text": "I have no idea how this place got the reviews it did, or why it is so popular (the place was very crowded and had long waits, though this is not the point of my review). \u00a0So it was my birthday and we decided that we wanted a special high tea. \u00a0As we always do, we looked up on Yelp a good place for it (our originally desired place, Swan, was sold out for weeks). \u00a0Harrod's came up with good reviews, so we wanted to try it, \u00a0and since it was my birthday we didn't really care about the 4 $ sign; we wanted the best.Harrod's itself was neat to walk around; the jeweler was pretty and it felt very artistic. \u00a0We laughed a little at the high price of the average looking handbags and saw their excellent sweet shop and such. \u00a0So having to wait for a table turned out to actually be pleasurable.Much worse can be said for the high tea experience. \u00a0For reference, we ordered two High Teas; mine vegetarian, my wive's not. \u00a0We paid the 10 extra pounds for the champagne round, making the total cost of the high tea 65 pounds per person (with tip the final bill was $190 after conversion; or 143 pounds).The first thing we noticed was our waitress was quite rude. \u00a0Far from the high-class experience we desired, she was curt and short with us, always hurrying. \u00a0They looked understaffed, so I can understand that to a degree, but if you are looking for a high-class experience you expect much better. \u00a0This alone would have been enough for a poor review; but there was more (and, in fairness, the other waiters and waitresses we flagged down seemed much more helpful; our waitress never returned except to deliver foods otherwise).The sandwiches were, in a word, horrible. \u00a0You get 4 small slivers of sandwich, which I guess for a high tea is \"standard\" (combined they might add up to 2/3rds of a full sandwich). \u00a0So the issue was A) they were stale and B) They were terribly unimaginative. \u00a0I wanted unique chef dishes, what I got were some stale cucumber pieces and such. \u00a0Which was far better than my wife, who found her meat sandwiches completely unpalatable.The tea was OK; my wife said hers tasted like Lipton. \u00a0I love tea, but these were bland; for having a \"special blend hand crafted by a tea master\", they sure tasted like standard green and black teas. \u00a0Nothing unique or particularly impressive here.The deserts were a little better, but not much. \u00a0The scones were actually quite good, and had a very tasty homemade jam that went on them... truly the meal's highlight. \u00a0The rest... each of us had a banana bread that we took 1 bite from... like the sandwiches, they were stale and tasteless. \u00a0The mouse bite was pretty nice, and there was a raspberry jello-Like dessert that was, while not good, at least an attempt at being different. \u00a0A nice \u00a0tarte, a bad lemon mouse, and some other forgettable bites.Overall, our 2nd most expensive meal of our lives turned out to be a forgettable experience worse than our basic $20/person high teas in Atlanta. \u00a0Even the decor is not terribly good; nothing either high class or modern about it. \u00a0We decided to not complain (who wants the drama); and promised ourselves to post a review to warn others away from our mistake. \u00a0Try Swan house if you want a high tea; we got an unforgettably delicious dinner there, and regretted not booking a tea there as well.",

(Tea is not served on the Terrace.) It is a quiet area with a roof-top view of Knightsbridge. The service is super-slow but it is a nice place to have a cocktail and something to eat in peace and away from the chaos of the rest of the store. The class British food is made from British ingredients and served the same menu as The Tea Room, \u00a0is priced on the higher end (which is expected) and it is decent...not outstanding.

My husband and I shared \"The Wedgewood\" option on the menu. It was \u00a332 and it included tea, a selection of finger sandwiches, scones served with clotted cream and assorted jams, and your choice of one sweet delight from their menu. We found it to be a great deal for the price. The finger sandwiches were tasty, my favorite being one that had salmon. But can we talk about the scones with clotted cream?!? Clotted cream FTW! Harrod's is a magical store! I'll definitely be back for tea and for shopping!!!",
