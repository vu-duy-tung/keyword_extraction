    "text": "I spent 10 hours here yesterday for a birthday gathering. We booked a table for 12 people from midday onwards and stayed until 10pm. It was fantastic. We were in the back room downstairs, which has no natural light, but still feels quite spacious and full of character. It did get a little warm during the busiest part of lunch (around 2pm) but the ceiling fans helped. I was worried the place would get ridiculously busy and cramped but it wasn't too bad at all. There was a great atmosphere, and even when rushed off their feet, the staff were very pleasant and friendly. They had some great real ales (although their guest ale had run out), a good wine list and plenty of non-alcoholic options for the drivers among us. (Try the apple and mango juice). The food was pretty damn good too. The Sunday roasts were average but nothing to complain about. But I also had a baked brie with toast soldiers and cranberry jelly (delicious) and a highly recommended chocolate dessert with lovely ice cream. Perfect. I recommend booking a table. We took along some playing cards, trivial pursuit cards and the board game 'Articulate' and had a great time. You don't need to book too far in advance either. I booked on Friday afternoon and there was no problem fitting us in (around a huge oval table).",

It's a kind of country pub in the city, and offers a quiet and pleasant atmosphere just metres away from the main road in Hampstead. Although pricey, this place can get inundated with students from time to time, but generally the mood never gets rowdy. The staff are pleasant and happy, and I've never encountered even a sniff of trouble in here. The large tables in the back are good for meet-ups with friends, but there are more intimate tables in the front dining room, which are quite snug in the winter.",

While the German lager Veltins was solid, and the salad with apples and mackerel was excellent, the fish pie was quite bland. Perhaps this was accurate for a fish pie, but I don't care. I want my food to be tasty. Do something noveau, don't just serve me some 12th century damp island crap. I wanted to get the treacle tart, and they told me they had run out. Well guess what Holly Bush, my review ran out of Yelp stars. I got the sticky toffee pudding instead. It came highly recommended. There was nothing notably good about this sticky toffee pudding at all. In fact, I recommend going to Waitrose, shelling out \u00a31.29 for a Lovetub, and sticking that in the microwave for 30. That will be a sticky toffee pudding to delight you. Not what they have here.",

It has such a wonderfully old English vibe.. log fires, low ceilings, lovely dark wood, nooks and crannies to chill out in, tasty ciders, but most of all incrediblely yummy pies!! It's heaven for a veggie on the pie front you can choose from the onion, leek, wild mushroom, cheddar and breadcrumbs pie mmmm (which comes with mash, broccoli and carrots) and if you're a pescetarian you can opt for the organic salmon and smoked haddock pie mmmmmm (which comes with lovely creamed spinach and other veg). Just superb. This place has something magical about it, tucked away off a little winding path and it would have got 5 stars, but it's cursed somehow because it always seems to be the setting for something drastic happening in people's lives, like breaking up with people mostly! Other than that, it's perfect. Although always very busy so expect a wait for a table (i.e eat before you go so by the time you sit down you're hungry again!)",

    "text": "The Holly Bush is situated within an area of London that looks more like a village than a bustling metropolitan. Having patiently waited for the kitchen to reopen, we strolled the area, really getting a feel for the environment. I think that if the Holly Bush were in Zone 1, their clientele wouldn't put up with the wait involved in receiving a seemingly exclusive VIP menu. When I finally had it in my hand I wasn't blown away, somehow I had expected crazy flavour combinations and words I'd never seen before. The menu was very gastro pub inspired but included goodies like shallot gravy and purple broccoli. I opted for the soup of the day and the meatloaf, both choices I would usually avoid. Having searched out a nook-like room with a skylight, the rain that fell over us was perfectly atmospheric. While the service was bare necessities it remained functional and pleasant. The food, on the other hand, was absolutely lovely. My meatloaf was very meaty, mash was very smooth and the purple broccoli was pristinely steamed. Leon's liver was also gorgeous and was truly the only liver I've ever enjoyed. The Holly Bush was no disappointment, very popular with the locals and has an old fashioned charm. 1 star removal for the lack of happy happy joy joy behind the bar.",

    "text": "There is no place quite like The Holly Bush. \u00a0Although only meters from Hampstead tube station, the pub is tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac at the top of Holly Mount, accessible from Hampstead High Street only by a steep stairway or an uphill climb along a narrow road. \u00a0As a result, it is an urban pub with a country-pub feel.The building is worthy of its location. \u00a0The pub was built in 1643 as the stables of a house later owned by painter George Romney; shortly after Romney's death in 1802, the stables were converted to a tavern, and pints have been pouring here since 1807. Artist John Constable gave an art lecture in these rooms in the early 19th Century; physicist Michael Faraday debated, by gas light, the utility of electricity. It is rumoured that Samuel Johnson and James Boswell drank here, and that the ghost of a long-departed waitress still takes the occasional food order.The Holly Bush is now a Fuller's pub, pouring a range of Fuller's products on five casks, including the ubiquitous London Pride and the richer, more flavorful ESB. The drier Harveys Sussex Bitter also is available, on a sort of permanent guest-beer basis. \u00a0I have been told that The Holly Bush pours the best pint of Sussex in London; I look forward to trying to verify that claim.The food is generally very good gastropub fare, but it can be inconsistent. \u00a0I have tried only one starter, a terrine of foie gras with chutney, that I found very pleasant for the price point. \u00a0 My braised venison shank was excellent--served on the bone, the meat was flavorful and tender, and the sauce thick and rich. \u00a0The steak-and-ale pie is superior, and it looks as good as it tastes. \u00a0The fish pie is smokey and creamy, packed with fresh, firm chunks of salmon and haddock. The sides and desserts have been uniformly good--the roasted vegetables in particular were sweet and cooked to the just the right texture. \u00a0On the other hand, I have had a roasted lamb breast that, although beautifully presented, was very chewy and fatty. Similarly, I found the Sunday roast sirloin tough and under seasoned--although I must disclose that both my wife and daughter disagreed, and happily gobbled up their portions. I have been quite pleased and rather disappointed with the service, sometimes simultaneously. \u00a0For example, on one crowded Friday evening during the Christmas season, we booked ahead through Toptable, but The Holly Bush never received our reservation. Nevertheless, and despite being fully booked, the staff quickly found us a table and seated us for dinner. But then, once our food orders were taken, our server seemed to disappear--I cannot imagine how much money has been lost by The Holly Bush and other gastropubs because servers infrequently (or never) return to take additional drink orders while diners are waiting for their food. If a pub is going to adopt a restaurant table-service model and charge restaurant prices, its diners have every right to expect restaurant-quality service.And one more small complaint, while I'm at it--can someone please turn down the heat?! The place is unbearably hot, in both the front and back rooms, far too often.That said, I have been very pleased with my experiences at The Holly Bush, and it has become our default local option for both a pint and a meal. \u00a0I recommend it highly.",

I searched Lamb and got a few listings. I searched Sunday Roast and found a few more, but then Ebony and Ivory came together and the Holly Bush was born. So many 5 star reviews? Could this be true? We would have to find out.We hopped the tube and about 20 minutes or so later we found ourselves at the Hamstead aka Land of Delicious Pleasures stop. We hiked up the hill and looked for the rumored stairs and there they were, yay, we were on the right track. As we curved through the narrow alleys and climbed the steps we were like two little kids in a candy store. Giddy, excited and so ready for the Sunday roastage. (Yes, I'm aware that isn't a real word... go with it.)There it was The Holly Bush, a welcoming sight in the grumblin' tummy night. We walked in and the place was filled with happy, drinking people. We grabbed a seat downstairs, but my friend took a quick lap to see what other options were available and sure enough there was an upstairs dining hall. And a gorgeous upstairs dining hall at that. Super high ceilings with yummy mint wallpaper and white trim. Mismatched tables and chairs that created a warm and friendly environment. And lighting that would make anyone look good. So key!There were a few parties or varying sizes from 2 to 10 people enjoying the offerings of the Roast and once I saw Lamb Shank on the menu. Oh yes, let's get this party started! We ordered the brie as a starter and I have to say, it was my least favorite dish I've had in London. It just tasted a bit like paste and the toasted soldiers were a bit raw. We went with a nice Southern Rhone blend wine that totally hit the spot and of course there was that lamb shank.It was so moist and delicious that it couldn't wait to fall off the bone and make a mad dash for my mouth. Delicate, full of flavor and really, wow, just amazing. It came with these cheese mashed potatoes and the combination of the elements were like poetry in my mouth. And how often can you say that as a single girl. Wait, what?All in all, the Holly Bush is THE place to go for Sunday Roast. The only thing I don't like about it, is the fact that I am leaving London in a few days to head back to the States and I won't get to again next Sunday. Wah :(",

The second time I decided that while it is nice to be in a traditional pub with character what I don't like about this pub is it has bad lighting and uncomfortable seating. It could use some updating to add some modern comfort. The crowd is a good mix and the bar staff friendly though.",

The Holly Bush is a Perfect Pub. It's exaclty what I expected from a pub when I came to London. Food is good, but let's focus on the drinks and atmosphere. Pretty crowded, I'd request a table as soon as you get here, it's nice to sit and people watch. Crowd is definitely a mixed group of genders and ages. Everyone is laid back and seems to be there to spend time with friends, and it's nice to see everyone talking and laughing with each other. Great selection of beers and ales...but whatever your pleasure, come here, order a pint, and take a load off. You won't regret it.A little hard to find, but that's how all great pubs should be.",

Tough to find, off the beaten path, and full of happy, friendly regulars. We lucked out and scored an outdoor table (with no smokers present nonetheless), and proceeded to drink a few Stella's too many. This was also my introduction to the wonderful girl. In fact, this experience may quite be the reason for my obsession for Stella. Every one brings me back to this wonderful place!Anyway, after camping out for a couple of hours, I realized that we only had 2 hours to get back to John & Gina's flat, catch a cab, drive out to Heathrow, and make our flight. Lets just say we were sprinting down the terminal, screaming at the gate keeper to hold the plane!If you EVER find yourself in London, hop the tube (if necessary) and track down this pub. Its well worth it!",

Plans had been made and plans had been cancelled ... several times ... until i could take it no longer and decided to visit all by myself a couple of weekends back.It wasn't easy getting to the Holly Bush. Its quite some way back from the main road. One has to walk up Holly hill from Hampstead station and then get onto Holly Mount in order to reach the destination :)The food was good ... the drink was good. I enjoyed my visit and it is a solid four stars. But i really wasn't moved to the point of raving about it as many others have. I will probably go back and would have surely visited several times had i lived nearby ... but it will not be a priority visit for me during a future trip to London ... which is my criteria for a 5 star.I started with a deep fried scotch egg accompanied by onion jam. The egg was not overly impressive but the sweetish jam was awesome. For the main course i had beef pie. I had to wait a for a pretty long time for this dish to arrive but the wait was worth it. It was served with a lot of vegetables (including whole beans ... something i don't remember seeing often) and was very big in size. I ate on and on and on and it just wouldn't finish. This was the best pie i had eaten in some time.I was sitting in the front room downstairs but i understand that there are further rooms at the back and upstairs. The decorations (primarily the old pictures on the walls) gave me a feeling of being transported to a pub in the 19th century. I can imagine that it would be pretty relaxing sipping a beer while sitting on one of the few chairs outdoors.For a drink i had one of the ales that the bartender suggested. It wasn't bad ... but i don't really like the dark beers ... i should have mentioned it to him.I ended up paying less than \u00a320 for a two course lunch along with a drink ... which was very cheap given the popularity this place commands. A reasonably positive experience on the whole.",

It offers a great Sunday roasts and ales which is very popular with the punters. I myself am a big fan of their pot pies. They have a certain formula in here that has worked for decades and they shouldn't change it one bit. As London Nightlife said, it's \"everything a pub should be\".",

It looks like a cute neighborhood place, and it was busy on a Saturday night; I learned later that there was a party upstairs. My fiance ordered me a champagne and we got seats at the bar. We were having a nice time, so I ordered a second prosecco. The two bartenders seemed wonderfully attentive, but the bartender who served me poured a glass well short of what I'd gotten before and what the menu listed as a serving. When I pointed this out very politely, he claimed that this was a normal pour for the house--less than half the glass, mind you--and that I'd have to pay for another if I wanted more. I said fine, just give me a proper full glass, and he said that it would take a moment: he'd have to fetch another bottle downtairs. Mystery solved: I'd gotten the last of a bottle! What a drag that he couldn't have just admitted to the obviously light pour and corrected the error; if it weren't for the lovely bubbles, I would have left with an awful taste in my mouth.",

A lot of the once pubs in Hampstead are turning into more upscale, gastropubs now and have restaurants too. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of these gastropubs, the Wells, the Horseshoe, the Old White Bear, I absolutely love them all. But the Holly Bush stays true to the traditional English pub. And it does it well.The decor of the Holly Bush is one of my favourite parts about the pub. It is a true \"old man pub,\" with it's mismatched furniture, old photos on the walls, and dark hard wood flooring, and I love it. It is cozy and perfect to enjoy a quiet one and enjoy a bite as well. There is also a small seating area outside that is lovely enjoying a pint in the summer.As a wino, i must say that I think the wine at this pub is actually quite good, with a fairly good selection. It changes quite often as well, which is good for us regulars. Most true English pubs only have two or three options, but the Holly Bush has more to offer. Also, the wine glasses are glorious, large and perfect for a huge glass of red to warm you up from the crummy London weather.The Holly Bush stays true to English pub culture and is always be a Hampstead favourite.",

It was absolutely bloody impossible to find first time even though it is just a stone throw from Hampstead station - which undoubtedly adds to its charm.Down small streets near Hampstead village and wonderfully secluded even though it is just yards away from a busy high street, it is a haven from the standard gastro pubs that now litter said high streets, the Holly Bush is a classic old London pub.Dark wood abound, funny little rooms and spaces going off in different directions. The big draw for me in Winter though (and I do think this is one of the best winter pubs I know of) is the big open fire in a relatively small room, wonderfully cosy - I could wish for winter for this reason alone.Sunday Roast is wonderful and has a small selection of classic traditional British nosh. Oh, and I have it on good authority that Jamie Oliver used to live next door in the early days of his career so he may have influenced it in some way, but probably not - for you celeb historians among you.",

    "text": "this is a lovely pub in hampstead village, perfect for an afternoon drink after a long walk on the heath. it has lots of hidden nooks and crannies, and is dark and romantic. the guys behind the bar were super nice and friendly - prices for drinks were fairly standard.the food menu was quite posh for pub food, so we opted for some olives and smoked cheese croquettes from the bar menu. the smoked cheese croquettes were SO GOOD...but, there were four of them and it cost \u00a34. wooooah, talk about an insane mark up. Good work Holly Bush!I'll definitely come back here for drinks - or maybe dinner if my parents are visiting and paying! My boyfriend & I have just taken home the sweetest (but most demanding) french bulldog puppy so we are always on the look out for dog friendly places that we can take him - I am happy to report that the Holly Bush is one of those places. Excellent.",

    "text": "The 'what would your last meal on earth be' game is always a fun one to play, no matter who you're talking to. Sometimes you'll find instant affinities with people you thought you didn't have anything in common with and other times you'll be shocked and disgusted by someone you thought you knew very well. I've genuinely known people to say that they would, as their last meal on earth ever, have a Domino's pizza - you have to question someone who's wildest dreams only stretch to the shops on their local high street. \u00a0Personally, my answer is always roast. OK, this might sound a bit safe, a bit mainstream, but if you think about it, it's actually just a reflection of my greedy belly. If I don't specify a particular roast, I can include everything from classic beef and gravy or pork with crackling to spiced roast duck and lamb with anchovies. Hell, I could even go for the curb ball nut roast option. The world is my oyster now had me the gravy.Having heard Laura N harp on about the Holly Bush on at least 3 occasions, I knew it must be something special - she is after all a Yelpasaurous. True to her words, this place didn't disappoint. Beautifully located, the Holly Bush has a slight Lords of the Rings ale house appearance. It's sunken windows and dark interior scream cosy hide away. In fact, Frodo and the gang could have saved themselves a lot of hassle if they had just popped along here.To eat, I had the roast beef and my boyfriend the pork. Not to make ordering too competitive, but I definitely won. Properly aged and full of flavour, the roast beef was of the quality you can only yearn to recreate at home. That's not to say that the pork wasn't delicious but my bonus Yorkshire pudding definitely swung the balance.Although there have been a couple of negative words about the service here, I would completely disagree. Our waiter was lovely, very charming and even though he made a couple of mistakes (mixing up the order with those next to us) he was far to nice about it for me to quibble.And so the point to my ramblings - if like me, you are a true roast fan, scoot your toosh to The Holly Bush - it won't disappoint.",

    "text": "NOTE FOR AMERICANS:It was an absolutely awesome experience. Having been in central London for the last two days it was really cool to see more of a neighborhood area with tons of locals, I think me and my friend were the only Americans in the place. The surrounding area is quite quaint. I don't know about other pubs here but this one seemed totally old school. Just a heads up, there's no system for getting seats, there's no waiting list, and no central place to line up for a table. Lots of the tables have reserved signs on them, but I have no idea how hard it is to get a reservation. So just be a little aggressive and grab a non-reserved table as soon as you see someone putting on their coat and getting ready to leave. The Chicken and Leek pie was awesome, and veggies were perfectly seasoned. The only thing I would have changed was the fact that my roast beef wasn't pink like I'm used to, maybe its just how they serve it there, but it was still really good. If I went back I woud definitely get the Chicken and Leek pie. This was hands down the most English experience I've had here so far.",

    "text": "I feel really bad giving this place only three stars, so I've avoided writing this review for a few days now. Holly Bush was just so cute and charming that I wanted to love it! As soon as I walked in the door, I fully expected to eat a delicious meal in a cozy, friendly environment. But I can't ignore the meal I actually got. \u00a01. The service was weirdly terrible. I got there right when they opened on Sunday, and immediately sat in a room that had a few other people sitting in it. I briefly looked at the menu, decided what I was going to order, and waited.And waited. What makes this weird, though, is that a waitress kept strolling through the room! She made eye contact with me at one point. I purposefully pushed the menu away from myself so that she would see that I wasn't looking at it, but still she didn't come over. It was weird.So I finally grabbed her attention and said, \"Excuse me, am I supposed to order food with you or should I go up to the bar?\" (Apparently I wasn't the only person confused about the server, because a bit later I heard someone at a nearby table call her over to ask the same question.)Once I had her attention, she was very friendly and took my order for the roast chicken meal with an extra side of macaroni and cheese.2. When my food came, it was disappointing from beginning to end. The chicken was pretty dry and unimpressive, and the \"roasted vegetables\" on the side absolutely were not roasted. (I can tell the difference between roasted and steamed vegetables, guys). I completely agree with the reviewer who wrote \"In a word, bland.\"Honestly, I think that Holly Bush would have deserved two stars, but I bumped them up to three for a very important reason: I don't eat beef or pork, and they were so careful to make sure that I didn't actually eat anything with a taboo ingredient that they checked the ingredients of the chicken gravy and ... yep, sure enough, found beef bones. So they gave me my chicken without the gravy, which I very much appreciated. For that gesture of kindness and professionalism alone, they deserve that extra star.",

The Holly Bush is actually an old house that was renovated into a pub, so it has a number of cozy rooms where you can sit. The room we chose boasted a skylight and a stack of British board games. I really liked the atmosphere, which seemed classically English to me.Food was excellent; I chose the cod and lentils after learning my first choice, the meat pie, was not available, and my husband had a sausage roll with jalapeno ketchup. Our pints of beer also satisfied, although I wish there had been a printed beer list vs. having to ask our server to rattle off a list of draughts from memory.I liked this place well enough to go back; my sister, who lives in the neighborhood, is a huge fan, so something tells me we did ourselves a disservice by coming to the Holly Bush during a downtime.",

People have been banging-on about the Sunday Roasts here for years on Yelp but based on the one I had here this year I really don't see why. Sure it's decent enough but not a 4 star meal and certainly not a 5 star delight. Look. A roast should either be a banquet of traditional comfort food perfection, or should be a cheap old faithful like dropping round grans. Too many places in London are doing circa \u00a320 a head roasts that fall badly down the gap between nan's Sunday lunch and a fancy-ass feast at a posh hotel on the Monopoly Board.

The place is dog friendly, but it also smells like dog when you walk in. \u00a0This is coming from a dog lover. The only up sides, are that is is a nice little lively pub, good natural lighting and they could squeeze us in right at opening time without a booking. \u00a0I'd never go back, or recommend it to anyone else though, so for that reason they get a two star rating.",

I'm still new to the whole concept, being a long-time bruncher... but I'm pretty sure I could get used to it. I ordered up the lamb roast (supposedly with capers and mint) and it was virtually indistinguishable from the more traditional Beef Wellington that my cohorts were served up - in fact, the only way we were able to tell them apart was that -theirs- had a pastry on the plate. Oddly, I encountered neither capers nor mint on my dish, but I did uncover a mound of perfectly roasted potatoes, fresh cruciform vegetables, a root vegetable or two, and a sprinkling of beans and peas. If the pristinely clean plate that stared back at me twenty minutes later was any indication, it all went down just fine. I will admit to resorting to some generous additions of salt and pepper, though.The staff is just lovely, being ever-so-patient with our reservation confusion. Fortunately, they take down the phone numbers of everyone who books, so we were sorted after much confusion. And they make a solid bloody mary, though you may need to ask for ice.In the future, be sure to enunciate carefully when calling to put your name down. Otherwise you might end up in a pickle.

They suggested The Holly Bush, a short walk from their home, and in my mind at least, a quintessential British pub. I loved everything about our visit, and It will surely be a highlight of my European tour. Walking up a hill along a curved, narrow street set the tone for entering the quaint, laid back pub. I instantly felt like i was miles and decades away from the rest of my London experience. The staff was friendly as our party walked in and found a table. At first i thought the server was a little standoffish, but...and I'll be honest here...i have a terrible habit or mistaking British accents for condescension (I'm trying to work on this, i swear!). She was actually incredibly friendly and accommodating, and was even making googly faces as my baby nephew. The food was excellent! I had the quail pie, as well as a bite of the boyfriend's baked goat cheese. I was expecting the quail pie to be warm, so the fact that it wasn't was a bit of a surprise. Still good, though. The baked goat cheese was AMAZING. For an entree I had the lamb, and it was quite juicy and flavorful. I really enjoyed the vibe of this pub. My only regret is that instead of sampling more of their local ales, i stuck with Pimms and lemonade (though actually Sprite to us Americans, I've learned) I think sitting on the front patio area and drinking the afternoon away would be one of the best things to do in London. I can't wait to be back in the winter and come back here again. I was thoroughly impressed.",

The Holly Bush is located on Holly Mount near Hampstead Tube Station, accessed via a steep stone stairway just off Heath Street. It was built in 1643 as a stables owned by painter George Romney. Shortly after Romney's death in 1802, the stables were converted into a tavern. Samuel Johnson and James Boswell are rumoured to have drunk here. Now a Fuller's pub, it serves a wide range of beers and real ales on tap and has an extensive food menu (including Quail Pie and Baked Goats Cheese) which is perfect for sharing over a bottle of wine. There are plenty of cosy little corners to snuggle up with a loved one or catching up with friends and there is a small seating area outside that is lovely for enjoying a pint in the sunshine. All in all when you enter The Holly Bush, it is like taking a step back in time and you feel like you have discovered a piece of London's history that was meant just for you. itsnosmallthing.weebly.c\u2026",

    "text": "This is a lovely traditional pub, tucked away in a tiny street, a few minutes' walk up the hill from Hampstead underground station. Cited by some as one of the best pubs in London, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but it is very nice, and the best pub in central Hampstead. The atmosphere is almost Dickensian: wooden floors and wood-panelled rooms sprawl away behind the bar, and it has real fires blazing in the winter. Actually starting life as a stable around 1650, the pub is a Grade-II listed building. With a very good selection of well-kept real ales, the extensive food menu has a good reputation, and it's not too pricey for this neck of the woods. (I much prefer it to the food at the nearby Horseshoe gastro-pub, which I find pretentious). They do a nice pot of olives as a bar snack, too. At week-ends you can book ahead if you want to eat (advisable). It can get rather busy, especially at the slightly cramped bar area. Parking nearby is very limited indeed, and although most of the pub is on the level, there are a few steps to the lavatories, and the doors to them are not wide enough for wheelchairs. The hill up from the station is also rather steep - but that adds to the Dickensian feel...",

    "text": "The Holly Bush is one of my favourite pubs in London. Tucked away on Holly Mount it's a very quaint place. Old oak flooring, etched windows and wood paneled walls give it a quintessentially English feel. It's a real olde worlde drinking hole dating back to the nineteeth-century with lots of original features, but thankfully without any of the tackiness that recreated interiors end up with. You wont find brass horse shoes and tankards lining the frieze here. With it's positioning it has the potential to be a Barbour clad, old boys pub, but thankfully you're always bound to find a mix of interesting characters drinking with you. From thespian types sat on a lone table running through their lines to Heath walkers who pop in post-walk. On a lunch time it's usually full of people with a HB behind their ear and a stack of papers piled up on the table. All come here purely for an honest love of a good pub.I've eaten here many times and sometimes it can be a bit hit and miss which is a shame as I really can't fault the drinking aspect. \u00a0Their pies are delicious though, especially the 'Organic Beef and Harveys Ale with Chedder Mash' that really hits the spot after a chilly autumn walk. It's the sort of place that would be good to be in as snow collects outside on the window paynes whilst you sit by the open fire and drink a glass of mulled wine. It's quite simply, toasty.",

    "text": "Having taken my father here for a surprise birthday meal, we were bitterly disappointed with our visit. Firstly, though very quiet, the service was also very slow. Having worked in restaurant management for 15+ years it was evident that a 30 minute wait between courses meant that the restaurant was understaffed back of house and with only 2 waiters around, it seemed the case in the front of house also. An expensive starter or crab meat and langoustine was so miniscule it was ridiculous. My father and girlfriend ordered dover sole, which, with no pun intended, was literally swimming in oil and butter. Unfortunately due to how long we had to wait previously, she did want to order another meal and it was returned at the end of the meal. Fortunately the Swiss waiter took it off the bill after he saw the state of the oil spill in her bowl! I ordered what was described as 'hot smoked salmon with risotto' at an astronomical \u00a320. What arrived was a bowl or creamy rice pudding esq risotto with a few flakes of smoked salmon. It was outrageous! After all that, I was hoping that at least they would provide a small slice of cake or something to acknowledge the message I had left on my booking, that it was my fathers Birthday. No such luck. In the end I left a good tip for the waiter, as he was trying his best to keep his head above water, with a non responsive fellow member of staff by his side. The lack of \u00a0experience in the kitchen, with poor preparation, presentation and portion size made the whole experience a waste of time and money. I am not one to complain normally, as I know how hard the hospitality industry can be, but I also have many years experience allied a 1st class honours degree in Hotel & Restaurant Management, so I feel I have a good understanding of industry standards. Unfortunately the Holly Bush did not meet any of them.",

    "text": "The Holly Bush is a legendary pub in London - that is much revered by locals and visitors alike.It is admired because it is non-corporate - \u00a0because of its quirky decoration and feel - and because of the people who run it and go there.Possibly our experience was atypical - but our experience was awful.The place is Non-corporate unquestionably - and I hate chain pubs with chain beer just as much as anyone else does.It is a bunch of tiny little rooms cut up in a jigsaw puzzle of different ways with old historic pictures of the neighborhood on the wall.The neighborhood outside is quaint and quirky (and you could never afford to live in those quaint and quirky cottages unless you won the lottery - but that doesnt make it any less picturesque).It was mobbed - with the lovers of the classic establishment etc etc.It was filthy.(Leftover plates and glasses and stuff from previous patrons everywhere most with food scraps, dirty napkins or other detritia).This also applies to the bathrooms.Physical maintenance was also in bad shape, as I leaned on a stair railing while going upstairs to have it come off the wall.On a 9:30 on a Saturday - they only had corporate brewed beers because they were OUT of 7 out of 8 of the non-corporate brews.(How can you be out of beer by 9:30 on a Saturday night?)The one non-corporate beer they did sell us was \"water beer\". I do acknowledge that some older forms of real ale pride themselves on an authentically watery taste - and this was one of those and that some people call that legendary beer.I probably should have just bought one of the other microbrews - if they had any (cough cough).The bartender drew both me and my wife SHORT Pints!!!What kind of serious bar fills the glass 85% full and calls it a pint?????????They also took our money for a scotch egg despite the kitchen having closed an hour before our order.(Someone else notified us of the kitchen closing in a more or less timely way. They did give us our money back - but we had to ask them to.)We left in disgust - our beers barely touched.I am sure that if you live in Hampstead and the best finest decent-est people in the world go to Holly Bush - that you would want to go with them to Holly Bush too.But I would say between not cleaning, not doing basic repairs, not ordering basic supplies and stiffing the customers on the drinks - there is not much to admire here.Maybe they were having a bad day?",

    "text": "The Holly Bush is an adorable, traditional pub worth the uphill walk in Hampstead Village. It is tucked in a bit of a corner away from the main hustle of Hampstead but once you arrive you will realize it is quite a popular place. There are a handful of different rooms, some for pub dining and some for sit down. We decided to stick with pub good and took a seat in the side room off the main bar. Although it was a Saturday it was easy to find a spot for two. We decided to split the fish and chips an order of the fried potatoes and the crab spread on toast (I think it was crab). All were delicious and even though we had two forms of fried potato (whoops) it was well worth it to try the two variations.",

    "text": "Does it get more idyllic for a Sunday afternoon in London? As roast-virgins, we made our snowy way to Holly Bush to pop our...chickens? Yes, pop some chickens. It was a lovely one to kick things off with. Protip: make a reservation. Sundays get quite bustly, and you'll want to sit and enjoy this. One smart gal in our party thought ahead and we arrived at 2pm to a reseved table (with our name on it, to boot!) ready and waiting. Let the inaugural roast commence!OUT OF SCOTCH EGGS. Oh, the humanity. Cannot report on them. We started with the chicory salad (very good!) and the sausage rolls (indulgent), and sped quickly into the main affair: ROAST. I had the chicken and he had the lamb. The chicken was sizably bigger, but I am a good sharer. The roasted potatoes and root veggies were just the trick to soothe on an uncharacteristically wintery day. There was a bit of delay (likely with the crowds) so it wasn't quite as hot as I would've liked, particularly the ares outside of the chicken (veggies, sauce, etc). Minor tweak. The snow is falling. The windows are foggy,. The roast is roasting. It's a pleasant (and very quick) little jaunt up the hill from Hampstead tube station --- you'll feel a bit like you are in a movie once coming upon it. Well, i did anyway. *dog-friendly. there were many! *service is quite alright, no service gratuity added in...so make sure to leave something. *reservations acceptedFirst roast accomplished and with vigor. Will surely return when in the area, the vibe is great for this spot, comfy, cozy and well-priced.",

    "text": "My dad & sister really set the bar high for Sunday roasts, so I knew I probably wasn't going to come away declaring this was the best ever. However, I was excited to have roast beef, as that's my favourite but in my house we normally have lamb (not that I'm bitter about that. Although I am).We got there early and had no problem getting a table, albeit in a somewhat unattractive back room. We ordered a couple of small plates because we were concerned the roast might take a while.As it happened, the roast came out first, which was a bit weird as the server specifically said they would bring the small plates beforehand. Also, they got the lamb and beef mixed up and then couldn't remember which of the beef was rare and which was medium rare (in fact, neither were either of those things). Actually it seems weird that there could be an option, unless they have a \"rare joint\", a \"medium rare\" joint etc. The meat was fine but not particularly good. Roast potatoes also below average. The other vegetables, however, were outstanding - varied, perfectly cooked and tasty. The serving was very generous, which is good because it's pretty expensive.I also loved the scotch egg we had - best I've ever had - so much better fried than eaten straight out of the fridge! (What? I never do that). Sausage roll was also good. Everyone also enjoyed their desserts - I tried the fruit crumble with creme anglaise. The creme anglaise was absolutely delicious, perfectly flavoured and so moreish!With better service and better roast potatoes (and also knowing what is beef, this would be four stars. It's a great place to stuff yourself before walking it off on Hampstead Heath. But dude: know your meat.",

The decor is worn but fitting and makes a change from the plastic wannabe 'traditional' bars that are common. I have never eaten here but am told that the pies are really good. The Hollybush is definately somewhere you could settle in for an evening and enjoy a really good night. Darts and Dominoes would be a great addition",

Tucked away up round the back of chi-chi Hampstead, The Hollybush seems to belong more in Hampstead's artistic past than it's super sleek present. Tiny and cosy and very wood-panelled in the downstairs bar, the upstairs dining room is lighter and airier and serves really delicious, well-made pub grub like pies and a good Sunday roast. Roaring log fires complete the effect, really the cosiest place to come after a winter trudge across Hampstead Heath.",

Located in old converted stables, it has a country feel that goes with its Hampstead location, tucked between homes that verge on castles, and mews straight out of a novel. There are various candlelit nooks and crannies that you can huddle into with friends, and out back there's a larger room with a sturdy wooden table at its centre, perfect for groups. It's dark and atmospheric, the kind of place where you wish someone would sit and tell you a Wuthering Heights type tale. As a student I used to love spending hours here reading and, if around Christmas, sipping mulled wine. I often return for nostalgic reasons and also for the food - the vegetarian sausages are some of the best I've ever had and the mash perfect - it's perfect hearty cuisine to match the fine settings. There is also a more formal dining area upstairs, and some seats outside. This is an ideal place to come to warm up after a jaunt on the nearby heath. It's like a slice of the country up on London's hill - delightful.",

I lived in Hampstead for 22 years and this was always my favourite pub, and the food was of a brilliant standard. In fact, when Jamie Oliver used to live next door, he came in so it can't be bad!! The clientele are smart but friendly and there is never any trouble, at least not that I have witnessed. They have a good choice of drinks, and some interesting changes from the usual generic, predictable brands. Another lovely thing is enjoying a drink outside in the summer as the sun sets, with the cute hanging baskets making you forget the hustle and bustle of city life.",

All wood and old and history and with a very English feel. It's lovely, and is exactly the kind of place you expect to find in wealthy lovely Hampstead. The food is quite pricey and I would actually recommend not having the sunday roast. My boyfriend's one cost well over a tenner and just wasn't that impressive - small portion and over cooked vegetables. My pint of prawns (actually a load of chilled cooked prawns in their shells with a wedge of lemon and a bowl of mayo) was absolutely divine and oddly not very expensive at all - although the prawns were clearly very good quality. The decor could be improved a bit - I realise it all goes in with the comfy and worn look, but chairs and sofas with rips in should really be replaced.",
