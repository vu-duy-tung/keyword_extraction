    "text": "Wish I had known earlier that a lovely lunch place like this existed in Holborn. \u00a0On my last lunch date I went to hummus bros! Anyway I had \"toast and rainbow trout\" (the trout was almost like guacamole but was delicious) and a ceasar salad which to be honest wasn't quite as good (chicken was a bit slimy, for want of a better description). I think both were around \u00a310. My dining companion had a steak melt sandwich which was apparently very tasty but arrived, slightly comically, on a tiny plate with no garnish or accompaniment. This reads like a 3 star \"a-ok\" review rather than 4, but I liked the busy ambience and nice surroundings and if you maybe choose carefully and ask a few questions of the waiter you will be fine.",

    "text": "This recently opened restaurant in the back of the Hoxton hotel has a trendy atmosphere with matching staff outfits and allows a peak at the food being prepared in the open kitchen. The open plan setting means things get a little noisy when it is busy. The food is an amazing twist on classic dishes with fresh ingredients. I would really recommended cured meats and the oxtail toast as starter, the duck (nice and pink) as main and the key lime pie dessert. Cocktails are similar classic twists and the homemade lemonade was a hit too! Highly recommended!",

For those with a sweet tooth, the cakes (try the Apple Strudle Cheescake) from Hubbard & Bell are to die for - so delicious, you'll want to put yourself into a sugar coma trying every single one. The coffee is well served too - being such a coffee snob, this is a real big sell for me.",

    "text": "Came to Hubbard & Bell on a Saturday night around 8pm and (to my surprise) the place was emptier than I thought it'd be... Though the Hoxton itself was packed. Since I had done my Yelp research prior to visiting, I noticed that there weren't many mentions about dinner here... So maybe their strength is brunch and people just go for cocktails at night? Idk. My group had made a reservation anyways and were seated immediately. Anyways, I ordered the following things:- Kale Caesar: I'd kale for this Caesar ;) I was in the mood for something a bit lighter but couldn't decide between this and the linguine, so I ordered a small portion of both. Why not have the best of both worlds, right? The Caesar was probably my favorite dish of the night. Not too overdressed but not underdressed and bland, the kale was prepared properly and wasn't bitter (I'm assuming they massaged it prior to serving too because it wasn't harsh and tough), and the egg on top was cooked a perfect medium rare haha. They also give you a hefty amount of chicken, so you can definitely order a regular sized portion and get full off of it- Linguine: their linguine was fairly unique in my opinion. For starters, it's pretttttty spicy so beware if you've got a low spice tolerance!! The dish had a squid ink linguine base, and was tossed with a decent amount of crab, seaweed, and nduja. There was a decent amount of crab, which made the dish fairly fishy. I personally liked it since it tasted like the sea, but my friend was super turned off by it and didnt finish hers. The seaweed was a creative inclusion as I'd never had a combination like that before, but it added to the \"taste of the sea\" theme the dish had going on, and it made the dish more refreshing (since pasta can get a bit heavy sometimes imo). As for the nduja, I didn't really taste it. It might have been why the dish was so spicy, but I almost forgot it was there until I had reread the menu. My friends also ordered the Pork Belly and Gnudi. I unfortunately can't comment on the taste of either since I didn't try them myself, but based off appearances... The Gnudi seemed to be a fairly small portion, but it looked good! The sauce seemed rich and creamy, and the pasta looked fresh. The pork belly on the other hand is something I'd go back just to try. The skin looked oh so crispy (pork crackling is one of my weaknesses in life) and they give you two sizable pieces! Overall, dinner at H&B was better than I expected, and I'll definitely be back to try their brunch.",

And very friendly staff, always! Normal I always have the avocado on toast with poached egg - always lovely, much better offering than in most places because at least they give you lots of avocado! Crumbled pistachios is a nice touch too. This time though I wanted eggs florentine! The obssession has come back!! Its not on the menu, but as they seemed to have all the elements in different dishes I though id be cheeky and ask! No problem at all! Which is kind of predictable but still nice! They were lovely. One of the eggs wasnt runny though, which obviously is a little dissapointing but overall good dish.Highlight at Hubbard & Bell has to be the juices!!! Awesome offering of really flavoursome cold pressee juices! In a little bottle too, so you can always grab another bottle to go! Had a try at the Red one today which was great. Highly recommend Hard Green too! But i am adament they are all great!",

I also got beef ribs when I ordered pork, but it was actually really good.The venue is very open and has a separate \u00a0bar area that I hear can get busy after work days, especially on Fridays. It has a feeling of a hotel about the place, and I think there are rooms available to stay in.There are loads of staff so getting served isnt a problem and they all seem knowledgable about the menu and friendlyThere is a good selection of coffees also. .",

As soon as I saw steak and eggs on the menu, I couldn't get downstairs fast enough.Being mid week and between Christmas and new year, the restaurant was quiet. Being around 11am I justified having the steak and eggs for brunch. I also ordered some hash browns but they already come with it YES! James ordered the avocado and eggs on toast with a side of bacon. The portions are great! The steak and eggs were not a disappointment. Nice hunk of fillet steak on 2 lovely hash browns topped with poached eggs, spinach and hollandaise YUM! If red meat wasn't so bad for you I would have this everyday for breakfast. I managed to nab a bit of James's breakfast too. The avocado and eggs on toast was delicious and the side of bacon was amazing, thick and perfectly cooked.If I was meeting friends in the area, I would definitely pop back here.",

I started off with a DELICIOUS apple and ginger cocktail that was lovely--though the bartender forgot to make it when he was making drinks ordered by my group and had to be reminded twice before he got around to it. It was quite crowded so I couldn't really fault him but he was rather rude when I finally caught his attention to make the drink I had ordered. Once we sat down for dinner, the waiter was nice but not very attentive (I had to ask for a refill on water 3 times) and the Thanksgiving meal (turkey with cranberry and green beans) was overcooked, over salted and quite tough--in short, not worth the \u00a319 I paid for it. That being said, all of the non-Thanksgiving food I saw at tables around me looked delicious so it could have just been the mistake of ordering off the holiday menu. Also, they were out of pumpkin pie at our 6:30 dinner seating--the main reason for our visit to the restaurant. :'(In the absence of pumpkin pie I had an amaaazing banana split that turned out to be the highlight of my meal. \u00a0All in all, I'd head back for cocktails and dessert but mediocre service and my very salty and rathered shriveled main left a bad taste in my mouth.",

And it does share the tendency of hotel restaurants to ever so slightly overprice the goods on offer.Having said that, the quality of the food was excellent, the waiting staff was nice (although there English wasn't always as good as the food they served) and the overall decor was pleasing in a retro-meets-comfy kind of way.

Becca had the ricotta toast with tomatoes and broccoli...so good! Dessert----key lime pie and a buttered pecan brownie...amazing! Really great vibe overall and many options including a coffee shop. Also recommend staying in the Hoxton Holborn hotel above. We loved having this restaurant on the ground level.",

Super overpriced, terrible service and surreptitiously given and charged for bottled water (my absolute pet peeve). I found the burger to be outrageously priced, so opted for two side dishes instead, and even then found the soup to be tasteless and too small for the cost. I had always thought the menu sounded pretty boring, but held faith as everything else about the Hoxton (where this restaurant resides) is so top notch I gave it chance. Turns out my initial gut feeling was correct. Skip it.",

It was busy and very noisy, annoyingly we were sat right by the DJ, which was really loud. \u00a0On arrival, I was a little earlier than my friend, I was greeted and seated by the hostess who was very friendly and nice. I also was asked if I wanted to make a drink order before my friend arrived and I ordered a cocktail which was very nice. The waitress told me I'd have to start a tab which I thought a little odd. When my friend arrived, we ordered drinks and our meals. The waitress was friendly and sweet but her English wasn't great and she kept asking us to repeat everything and any questions we had, she kept having to go and check so maybe she was new. The food - we both ordered burgers - was nice and plentiful. Our desserts were nice but very sweet and my friend's salted pretzel cheesecake was very rich and she had to leave lots of it. My sundae was lovely but very sickly sweet. Overall it was okay but not amazing and I'm sure the location is better for the bar and drinks. Great location in the heart of Holborn.",

Of course we noticed that everyone who had ordered their dinner after us had already started eating. The manager came to our table to say he was sorry that our food was coming out soon. So he offered us another cocktail which was nice of him. But that took another 20 mins to come out. It just sat on the bar waiting for someone to bring it to us. Not sure this experience was worth the hassle and or the meal. The feeling of the place is like a Starbucks.

Our sides were a mixed bag - the fries were good but the creamed spinach disappointed - soggy, cold in spots, and poor consistency.To accompany our meal we shared a bottle of the Grenache ros\u00e9 - lovely wine, perfect for the sunny weather we are enjoying!For pudding I chose the s'mores sundae. It was fine, but a little dull if anything - it lacked the flair of a good sundae when it came to finish. It was ice cream and stuff in a sundae dish - tasty but not a show stopping sundae by any means! My companion had the cheese plate which was very good; generous wedges of cheese, pleasant accompaniments, and lots of different breads and crackers on the side. The service from our main waitress and the gentleman supervising the room was excellent - that perfect balance where you're attended to beautifully, but can also carry on conversations uninterrupted! Another waitress tried to clear our plates while we were still eating, which was a little odd, but you can't fault the enthusiasm.I enjoyed my meal at Hubbard and Bell - when looking at the menu several other items caught my eye, as did the \u00a325 brunch deal on Sundays and several tempting looking cocktails. A good Holborn spot.",
