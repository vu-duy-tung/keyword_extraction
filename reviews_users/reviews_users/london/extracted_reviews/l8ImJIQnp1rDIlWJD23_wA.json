They give you a complementary fish cake while you wait, and the food is really good. I opted for whole lobster salad as a main and it didn't disappoint. The only things I would change is having proper pepper mills on the table, and not to put the brown edged salad on the plates but other than that, the service was good, and to be offered a free hot chocolate while I waited to pay the bill was a really lovely touch.",

Unfortunately they deep fry all the battered fish, fish cakes and chips in the same oil that they use for meat so I can't eat any of that, so the options are limited, but if you are not bothered by this sort of thing then get your laughing gear round this place and tuck in. Service was lacking this time and there was some confusion between order and table, but this is the first time this has happened in all of my visits. Definitely try the apple pie :)",

There's a separate take away counter on the side with a separate entrance which overlooks the restaurant kitchen so you can see the action. Our fish was freshly fried from what looked like diagonally cut thick sections of cod as we watched them being dipped in batter.The guys working the fryers were clearly at the top of their game and gave us some mini fish cake bites to snack on while we hungrily waited which were much appreciated.On eating: the batter was crisp, tasty and light and the encapsulated cod was perfectly cooked (fresh, snow white, steaming, tender flakes). The chips were great too. Just right.Portion size: generous as it should be.Mushy peas were the proper kind, not the crushed garden peas that some other places are dishing up....and the price was right.",

    "text": "Saturday around 1 pm we had reservations for 4. We definitely did not need reservations for lunch time as there were only a few other tables full. The restaurant is mostly white - white walls, white table clothes, servers dressed in white and has an open feeling. But it's not fancy, it's a bit dated actually. Very simple and could probably use a bit of a modernization.We were seating at a round table next to the window and given very long paper menus. There are tons of fish choices and you can have them prepared however you'd like - deep fried, grilled, or coated in matzo meal. We choice four different fish - Haddock, Halibut, Hake, and the Roasted Cod with Mediterranean vegetables. The Haddock and Roasted Cod were from their daily menu, but the Halibut and hake were specials. Most dishes from their every day menu are served without sides - you must order them in addition. The Roasted Cod came with vegetables and that was clearly stated on the menu. The specials sometimes include sides and sometimes don't. The Halibut was served as is, but the Hake included chips.We ordered all four grilled and I love that they are prepared very simply. No seasonings or spices. Just fish. We also ordered the arugula, tomato, and parmeasan salad as well as the tomato and onion salad. One of the dishes came with chips and another dish came with veggies, so we had four sides in total.The Haddock and the Hake were quite similar to one another. The Hake was a bit more flavorful in my opinion and also softer - almost mushy, but in a good way. It was my favourite. The Haddock was probably my second favorite - it's a very safe fish, not much flavor, so quite a good choice if anyone is skeptical of eating fish. The Halibut was a huge portion (and I say this as someone who thinks portions are always too small). One person would honestly have a difficult time finishing it, but then again it was a pricier dish. We had to fillet it ourselves, but it was really very easy to do. It came out in one piece and there were no strays little pieces. I wasn't crazy about the Halibut and I think that's largely because it was a bit overcooked, which is quite a big faux pas. This is a fish restaurant! You cannot mess up in the cooking of your fish. The texture was quite firm and chewy, but the person who ordered it said it was his favorite of the four, so it worked out well. The Roasted Cod was hard to judge because it was cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and heavily flavored. I didn't love the flavor of the spices, but others did. It actually turned out that The person who ordered the cod liked it the best, the person who ordered the Halibut liked that the best, and I happened to like the Hake more than the Haddock and the Hake recipient liked the Haddock more, so we switched. It was perfect and I would highly highly recommend ordering different fish if you're going with a group of people. One of the best parts is getting to try several different fish all at once so you can really taste the difference in flavor and texture with fish.The sides were nothing to write home about. The tomato and onion salad was a large plate of just tomato and red onion. The arugula salad was just a pile of arugula with tomatoes and parmesan slices on top. The chips were mediocre. But I still love the concept of the restaurant, the variety in both fish choices and preparations, and I would definitely recommend it overall.We were also given complimentary salmon cakes (no one could taste the salmon and we actually had to confirm that we heard correctly that it was a salmon cake). Good, though.Service was very good - everyone was friendly, attentive, and answered questions patiently.",

The decor is plain, simple and clean, and the fish is fresh and wholesome. Definitely stick to the fish dishes if you can as that is what they do best there.  The typical fish and chips option is always a safe bet. A choice of fish (cod, haddock, plaice) can be done deep fried, grilled or as a matzo meal order a side of chips and mushy peas to top it all off.

    "text": "Fish Central lives on the corner of a square near Old Street. At 9PM, it was one of the only places open on that square, and seemed like a magnet for people. Maybe they were drawn to it by the overwhelming smell of fish that you notice ten yards away on the street. The waitors all had senses of humour. When I asked if my Haddock would come with anything, the answer, by the waitor with a thick Italian accent which made it all the more surprising, was a deadpan, 'Yes. With the plate'.And that is where I take a star off (that, and the fear of the stink). It was slightly pricey for the amount of food you get if you are a struggling artist type. The cheapest main course was 7.95, but doesn't come with anything, so of course you have to order sides, which are between \u00a31.50 and \u00a33, which means that without ordering any drinks, the minimum amount you will spend is \u00a310. Not very expensive according to some, a bit pricey for fish and chips. However, very yummy fish (the batter was excellent), pretty good mushy peas, and good chips. You can order all sorts of different kinds of fish, done in many different ways (my friend had black bream, not fried, which was outstanding) but if it's not cod or haddock, the prices for a main go up to \u00a310-\u00a314. The fish is very fresh, and probably worth it if you like fish. Which you would if you went to a place called Fish Central. They had two dishes for non-fish people, but seriously, what would be the point?They offered us a starter on the house, salmon fishcakes, which were delicious. I found a bone in mine. Proof that it is made of an actual fish.",

Felt like eating a ball of pasta with nothing in it.The Lobster Spaghetti was literally a pound office pasta with a few heirloom tomatoes and a few very small pieces of lobster.The Dover Sole was a nice piece of fish, but ultimately lacked flavor. It's like they forgot how to use sauce or seasoning.The Chips were bland as sin, and lacked any quality texture or flavor.Service was also ridiculously slow. After completing our meal and taking our plates, it was a challenge to flag a waiter to actually get us the check.Overall, just a lackluster experience.

They were freshly made, incredibly light and fluffy inside making the thin crispy batter almost collapsing onto itself as soon as you bite into it. The filling was mostly mashed potatoes with bits of salmon but packed full of flavours from the addition of herbs and greens. Served with pickled cucumbers for that nice zest to it.West Mersea oysters Incredibly fresh oysters served with vinegar, Tabasco and lemon slices. The only complaints was that they weren't washed thoroughly so still had sand in some of them. Howeverthey were lovely and plump offering a clean aftertaste.Pan fried scallops Another dish where freshest and quality plays a huge part in making this so delicious. They were incredibly bouncy and sweet even without dipping it into the salsa verda. Although the latter helped add a lovely layer of herby flavour. A very generous portion for \u00a37.45Plain grilled Scottish lobster with chipsA choice of Canadian or Scottish lobster and we chose the latter. Even being plain grilled the freshest of the lobster gave it that intense sweetness. A side of garlic butter and spicy sauce to help add addition flavour. The meat was very springy, coming straight off from its shell. Utensils given to crack open its claw to pick out the rest of the meat.SardinesSimple chargrilled sardines served with tomato and onion salsa. These almost flaked away in my mouth and although an oily fish the fishiness was very mild and more sweet due to the freshness. Chargrilled perfectly so the skin just crisp but the interior remained juicy. A lovely salsa to add a lovely contrast crunch to the textureHot oak smoked salmon saladSo thankful to the waiter who recommended this dish as it was phenomenal, especially for salmon which rarely wows me anymore. The salmon although smoked, remained moist. The strong sweetness from the honey contrasted with the savoury and spicy in the salmon marinate really gets the tastebuds going. Mixed with a lovely contrast of textures from the salad. Deep fried cod fish & rock salmonAs fresh as the fish was I was not a big fan of the hard crusted thick batter which soaked up a lot of oil. However it was crisp rather than dense so was easy to break through. The fish also came unseasoned so constantly needed salt to be added to give flavour throughout. Luckily both the fishes shone on it's own as they were so fresh their natural sweetness prevailed, with cod being more delicate in taste and plumpier in texture and \u00a0rock salmon sweeter in taste and more moist in texture.Rocket and tomato salad (with Parmesan)Something green, simple and light as a palate cleanser before we move onto the next dish. All very fresh with the tomatoes and lovely rich Parmesan there to give the dish umami.Whole grilled dover sole An incredibly meaty fish, meat densely packed but incredibly bouncy and delicately sweet in flavour. Perfectly grilled keeping all the moisture intact and the bone just came off the meat showing how fresh it was too. Probably my favourite fish out the mains.Grilled wing of skateForking through the gaps of the bone to take off the meat off the bone, all done effortlessly. Each strand was incredibly tender and springy, delicate in flavour although could have done with more salt to lift its flavour. The capers help add a contrast of sourness and beurre noisette giving it a nice buttery coating.Chips were the most disappointing part of the meal, very uninspiring, bland and limp. They needed to be fried longer allowing the skin to crisp and seasoned to give flavour to the potato.Creamed potatoes were much more successful, seasoned and with the addition of herbs to give it flavour. Could have been creamed further with the help of water as it was slightly too thick and heavy.I rarely get to eat such fresh seafood in London without paying an extortionate price for it. For freshness along and one was able to cook and retain all the moisture and sweetness in the seafood, I'm so impressed it has even become my favourite seafood restaurant. However their batter used for their fish and chips was disappointing, far to thick and heavy. There's definitely a lot more better for fish and chips like Kerbisher & Malt, offering a lighter crispier batter.But nothing can beat this lively Mediterranean atmosphere, low prices and the fact it is a homely local restaurant running for 48 years.",

Had the fish and chips supper which was 13 pounds for three courses. They give a complimentary fried salmon ball, which was not bad - crispy on the outside, but the filling wasn't very good. The shrimp cocktail appetizer came with the prix fixe, and it wasn't big shrimps with cocktail sauce (which is what I was expecting), it was tiny shrimps covered in a mayo-ketchup sauce - not that appetizing.The portion of fish and chips was huge. I had the cod - crispy on the outside, but kind of mushy texture on the inside.For dessert, I had the special tiramisu - not great and I think it should have been colder.They also gave a free shot at the end (vodka, oj, and blue curacao) - yum!Overall, great, friendly service, but the food left something to be desired.",

The halibut, cod, plaice, skate, are all nicely done. Batter crispy, and at least one of my friends couldn't get enough of it.
