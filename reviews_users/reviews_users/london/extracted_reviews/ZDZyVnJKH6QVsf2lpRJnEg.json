But seriously, I don't like beer. when the weather's nice, it's super chill to drink in the patio area, though i often get suspicious looks from the bouncer for looking underage. the inside is actually pretty confusing, with all the different levels and half-levels, but i think i'm able to find my way to the restroom now without getting lost now..always a fun place to meet the guys and hang out, since boys really do like beer. think we had food here once and it was decent/good. nicer than the walkabout around the corner, but still has the pub-like feeling if you don't want to go to loud-music bars. start your night here! then go to dirty martini ;)",

And when someone suggests The Porter House, you probably crap your pants a little. Yes! It's an entire HOUSE of BEER. International beers that no one has ever heard of! SWEET!However, when you get there, you're probably going to be a bit disappointed. Why?Because it's littered with shouty, suity men with pointy shoes eating over-priced chips with their PAs who are drinking large glasses of ros\u00e9. (Don't get me wrong, I like ros\u00e9, too. But not at THE PORTER HOUSE.) Sure, they sell a lot of beer. Sure, they have Anchor Steam. Sure, they have Casablanca. But they just don't strike me as being an establishment of beer lovers. The staff will let you try out an ale you've never had before, but they don't want to talk to you about it. They're not passionate about beer. If their staff can't even get excited about what they have on tap, why go there? I'm always disappointed by The Porter House. There's never anywhere to sit, despite there being 3 - 4 levels. The staff is never that nice. It's dark, and not in the sexy way... And most of the interesting beers seem to be behind glass on display rather than behind the bar. Get thee to The Rake instead, and don't waste you time with this place!",

The place is huge, with many levels and little areas to hide and drink away in. It had outdoor seating too, though this was impossible to get a seat in due to it being a nice summers evening and rammed with people.The beers menu is huge, offering huge amounts of beer and lagers from around the world. They appeared to be doing a Belgian beer festival (starting the day after) with an even greater number of beers.The service wasn't amazing. There are so many small bars around, and so many beers on offer, that if you order one that isn't on the menu, the barman has to go and find it from the other bars which can hold the queues up. Strawberry flavoured Fruli beer seems to be a big seller here, though this might have just been me noticing it as I was amazed to find it on tap in a pub and not bottled in a supermarket.I can see why some reviewers dislike the service, as the staff seem not to care about the beers. When you have that many on though, and as many customers as they do in a bar this size, you can't expect a personal service every time, particularly when it is very busy.The food looked quite good, though I didn't try it on this occasion as were there for drinks only. It was surprising to see a live band come on which was a nice addition to the venue. I would definitely return next time I'm in the area to this, just to try a few more drinks from the menu.+Loads of places to go when it gets really busy+Live music+Huge beer and drinks choice-Can be too busy-Outdoor seating limited-Sometimes slow service when they're fetching drinks from other bars",

My ex-girlf gave me an unhappy scoff that announced she didn't care. She was still mad from when I bowled in at 3am as hammered as Friar Tuck.But alas, it wasn't a dream! A sober visit to the Porterhouse confirmed my suspicions! This place is huge, twisty, dark and suspicious. It took me at least 10 visits to truly understand this place and if a friend announces 'meet me in Porterhouse', you know it's not going to be an easy task. Buuuuutt.... that's the charm of this place. It's different (yeah ok, it's very similar to Waxy's) and a lot of fun.On Friday night they normally have a covers band playing downstairs to entertain the drunken suits and the tourists alike. Their range of beers is good, if not quirky, and the food isn't bad either. It's a great central London spot to get to early and take over a large table. Cracking for the rugby if you can get there early enough to secure a seat!Don't expect \u00a0any sunlight. Do expect to fall in love with pints of Frulli.",

Didn't try their food, didn't notice if they served any but my guess it would be standard pub fare. \u00a0Either way definitely a place I will go back when I know there will be some live music.

In particular when I went they were out of some of their best beers and I saw no signs of special beers that made the Dublin Porterhouse really special for me.They have a good selection of international beers available though and having not yet found anywhere else in London which has a decent range of good beers I guess I will have to go back, but I won't be going there to eat again.",

I fully expect one day to take the wrong set of stairs and meet a centaur in a snow-filled forest...at least I hope I do! I have been here many times over the years and I'm not the least bit shamed to admit I don't think I've ever left without being at least a little tipsy. It's just not the sort of place you come for a diet coke! They have all manner of beers including some lovely fruity ones that I love. They often have live music and I've always been impressed by their selection of bands playing some cracking well-known folky and rock tunes. I accidentally visited Porterhouse in Dublin last time I was over there. I say accidentally because we arrived after visiting a long line of other pubs and upon commenting 'this place reminds me of Porterhouse on Maiden Lane' my weary-friend rolled her eyes and pointed out we were in a Porterhouse. Well how was I to know there was more than one?",

I was rather uncomfortable with the number of people there, but, for being in London where they aren't used to this heat, I need to be nice. \u00a0I would rather give it 4.5 stars, but I can't.",

There is a downstairs right down bottom that I didnt even know about .. they open it when it gets busy and its a bit like being in a library... well actually only because of all the wood .. the people, noise and boooooooozzeeee make it feel nothing like a library... anyway she babbles .. its great fun, a touch on the pricey side but a great choice of beers and their house champers is a good price! Check it out! If there is a large party of you get there early to find a table .. if you are at the very bottom be sure to text people thats where you are as its easily missed and there is no reception",

I had no idea what to expect, but being faced with several work colleagues standing outside wasn't one of them! As I was technically on holiday, we went elsewhere for some food, but returned later in the evening. What can I say? It's a veritable maze of nooks, crannies and different bars. God help you if you've had a few, because it's wholly likely you'll get lost.The outside patio entrance was rammed when we first arrived, but if you're in a big group of friends, could be quite fun. No sun though, as it's just off a courtyard in a street small enough to be an alleyway ;)Once inside, we guessed that the upstairs bar would be empty (we were right), so went up there to sit and drink. Being in there reminded me of an old pub with a personality disorder - half attempting to hold on to its roots with red patterned carpet and wooden tables, but half try to pimp itself out. Point in case, there was karaoke going on when I eventually found the bathrooms downstairs.Either way, the drinks were reasonably priced (for Covent Garden) and there was no atmosphere that made staying there uncomfortable. This is one of those places where it really matters who you're there with. I was with my best friends, so had a fun night anyway.",

    "text": "Really love the deco here, brass and wood, just reminds me of the Steampunk style. Lots of stairs, mezzanines, a bit hard to navigate and find your friends at first, but you get used to it quickly once you made a round of the place.The selection of beer is indeed bigger than most of the pubs in London, but the staff was not very helpful about them.. barely telling anything (do they actually know what they're selling ?! ). As a Belgian, I love to try out good beers, but here we have little infos about them. So far I have just decided to down the country list (excluding Belgium, obviously), picking one per country.If you want quite a special beer, you HAVE to get the Samichlaus (santa claus beer). It is a brown beer, and has a very particular and strong tastes and smell, not to mention it is a 14%. It is only brewed once a year before Christmas, and worth the try. You may like it or you may not, but try it. A friend told be about it, the staff couldn't give me advice on it when I asked for something truly special.Also, have a peek behind the bar, if they still have a \"Trappe\" (in a thick white ceramic bottle), that one is also good but not on the menu.Have to say another disappointment for the service : for a bar that wants to sell so many different types of beer, not serving them in the right glass is truly a shame =( Drink from the bottle or the right glass, the feeling and experience is not the same (ok, unless you want to get drunk, then we don't care)Not very font of the band's music that you can hear in (almost) the whole place, but that's ok. It is also very crowded, as expected from a popular bar. I am personally not fond of the atmosphere and mood by itself, something about it that doesn't give me a friendly feeling....",

Atmosphere was cozy and low key. I guess it's an Irish bar, but that was not obvious from any d\u00e9cor, menu items or anything else. Was not crowded at lunch time on a Sunday.Beer selection + microbrew status. I love trying local beers while visiting new cities.Cons Again with that picnic table seating (see: Fentiman Arms). Awkward to get in and out of, nothing to hang your purse and coat on and it feels weird to be that close to someone while you're eating. \u00a0There were only a few tables like this though, and there were also booths, high tops and belly-up bar seating. The bill came out before the food. I have never seen this in a restaurant. Maybe this was standard here, I thought, but my BF's father made a joking remark to the waitress about it, and she gave an impatient response that \"It's just our policy.\" No other explanation or reason, just stood there waiting for a card. Ok, so you know it's odd and I'm sure you get a lot of questions about it all day and get sick of explaining it, but deal with it. The whole transaction felt very awkward.Lack of beer description. If you create a menu for or work in a microbrew, you realize that 90 percent of your customers have no idea what the beer on your menu tastes lik, right? As a server, you need to get really good at comparing it to beers they have probably tried or at least heard of. Or at least be able to explain what the difference between ale and lager. Our server couldn't (or wouldn't). All in all, service really sucked.And that's step two: step one needs to be describing the beer on the menu!A Wash The beer. I only tried their Oyster but was massively unimpressed.The food and the prices: I get it. London's expensive. But you can still find pretty good food for a reasonable (relative to London) price. This place wasn't it. My particular meal was sub-par bar food. Granted what can you expect from a really simple dish like fish and chips? I don't know, but I was in the city KNOWN for fish and chips and I wanted it to be amazing! Not comparable to Phoenix's Renaissance Festival food.",

    "text": "I jokingly refer to this place as the Inception bar because there are levels and levels of mazes, and I'm always getting lost inside, and mobile service never works, and occasionally Marion Cotillard wanders out from a hidden doorway and tries to murder everyone.In all seriousness, the Porterhouse is a great spot for drinks after work. It can get crowded, especially on Thursday and Friday, but there are enough bars scattered throughout that you never have to wait too long to get served. Draft ales are quite nice, and at \u00a34-5, about right for central London. They recently had this really good seven-hops IPA on tap -- that was a nice surprise, because I never see truly bitter, soapy-tasting IPAs (that is meant to be a good description!) on tap in this country.The food is all right. It's refreshing to not eat at a Spoon's once in a while. The fries come in generous portions that can easily be shared by three or four people.They turn up the music quite loud on the main floors, but there are quieter nooks hidden throughout. I've been here with one friend and also taken a big group before, and we've never had a problem finding space. All in all, one of my favorite bars in the Covent Garden area.",

    "text": "I can see why the Porterhouse is soo popular with tourists. It's pretty awesome. It's got the wow-factor. Pink neon lights and bottle after bottle decoratively donning the walls. There's a great selection on draft on all bars. It just makes a nice change not to have the choice of C arlsberg or Carling. I had a little dram of them all, as is the custom and settled on a nice Chiller. Yum Yum Yum. On my visit I had a little explore, up and down the stairs I go. The toilets are hilarious. Small doors, and that's coming from a shortie like me.Despite its vast size, its reliably busy most of the time. Even if it doesn't feel crammed due to the spaciousness, good luck getting a table or somewhere to sit. Standing around can be a problem too, not many places to perch you drink on and far too many staff doors appearing from nowhere. As there was no where to sit or comfortably stand, the Mrs and I had a swift pint and left. I think it would be a fun place to go with a small group when some sort of match is on. Of course the Irish heritage is what makes the PorterHouse, and of course even though I've never visited the Dublin pub I know that this little tribute in Covent Garden doesn't hold a candle to it. However it is a lovely lively pub and would definitely recommend having a little \u00a0tipple there if you're about.",

Great selection of drinks and food at reasonable prices and a large outdoor area. The main selling point of this place is its size and layout. Having been there at least a few dozen times I can now tentatively say that I have seen all the differ nooks, crannies and places to sit. In reality, probably not! Staircases seem to go everywhere, balconies overlook mezzanines that themselves are overhanging bars and floors. Different areas for live music, I would suggest meeting any friends outside, you ain't gonna find them otherwise. Bag on team!",

Both were served to American sized portions, which is good because they were Americanized food at London prices, so we actually got our money's worth.For the most part, it's just another place to grab a bite and a pint.

With stairs leading to multiple sections, tons of standing rooms and tables, Porterhouse also offers a huge selection of beer that fills out the offering. They have about 6 house brews, lagers, porters, ales, strong ales, wheat, etc, and also another 10 beers on tap (I recommend their Brain Blaster and their Hop Head house brews if you like ales). They also serve wine (but come on, you don't come to a pub to drink wine!) and a large selection of bottles. It was Belgium beer celebration week so they had tons of Belgium brews in the fridge (not sure if that's normal) including Delirium, Leffe and others. I think beers were about 3.5-4 pounds each.It was absolutely packed on a Saturday night. I was told afterwards that it's mostly tourists here, but that didn't make a difference, it's a great place to go for a few brews!",

The former because I'd been to its sister (mother?) house in Dublin, and the resemblance is uncanny. The latter because I'd entered a place that was not just a bar, but an adventure.The porterhouse is like a large, 3-storey bar that's been folded in on itself like an Escher drawing: between-floor landings here and there with enough room for a few tables; a surprise staircase around a corner that leads you down to a sub basement with still more seating; bars sprinkled liberally throughout. If the nearest bar is too crowded, wander up, down, left or right to the next one.And what bars. A dozen in-house brews on tap running the gamut from the very blonde to the very brunette. Several of them prize winners. Poured by people who are proud of their product, and priced for partaking (rare in their Westminster neighbourhood.)The food is just-pub-food but we got along well for all that; I won't ding them a star for failing to be something no one should expect them to be. The feel of the place is vibrant, packed with that magical number of people that extroverts can turn into their own personal party, and introverts can turn into anonymity and peace.If you like beer and places that do it right, you should come visit.Pro-tip: they have 2 stouts and a porter. The \"world's best stout\" award-winner you're looking for is the porter. So have that one. And then have the stouts.",

Most people were stood 'round the bar having their brews but we grabbed a table as we were also grabbing a bite. The usual thing with similar establishments in England is you order your food & drinks up at the bar and then they will usually bring your food to your table for you.I tried their Porterhouse Red Ale and loved it! Served at room temp from the tap, as most beers in England. Had a twinge of fruit with malt plus it was a pretty bright red - I'm a girl after all and it doesn't hurt for my beer to look pretty. Although, my friend informed me that everyone would think I was a lesbian because ladies in the UK just do not drink beer. I assure you I like the fellas but I also do enjoy the pints.The interior is very cool with hidden seating spots, awesome woodwork abound, just a really nice looking place and super chill. It was a mix of families and drinkers on a Friday afternoon. I'd definitely return to The Porterhouse!",

It's got a fun vibe, isn't overly pricey and it's huge with loads of seating areas so it's good if you're in a big group.Something else I would suggest is buying as many drinks as possible in one round because service is a bit slow...",

Outdoor heaters would be a pleasant addition for the winter!Inside the Irish pub is like a rabbit warren - split over three or four floors, there are multiple bars, ante-rooms, nooks and crannies. It was well set-up for the rugby, with a huge number of screens of all different sizes in various areas. We found a bench tucked into a corner which did us nicely (although we would have struggled for a seat if we'd turned up less than 20 mins before the game).I've walked past the Porterhouse many times and always thought it looked somewhat intimidating. Having actually ventured inside though, I would definitely return, particularly to watch a game.",

    "text": "The Porterhouse had slipped out of my consciousness for several years after a spate of visits. \u00a0I was therefore long overdue another trip. We went on a Friday and was a bit nervous that it would be so packed there would be nowhere to stand/perch//sit or just generally \"be\". However, as the other reviews make clear this place is so big there is always somewhere to stand if you can't get a seat. It generally consists of a basement with a large bar, the ground floor which again has a large bar and the upstairs which has a smaller bar and two or three distinct areas. The upstairs sort of wraps round the pub and there is lots of standing room where you can look down on the other drinkers. The ground floor tends to be very dark whilst the lighting upstairs is a little higher whilst still being subdued.The Porterhouse brews its own beer. I tried the following brews;Red Ale (4.2%) (very bland)The Plain Porter (4.2%) (bland)The Oatmeal Stout (bland)The Pale Ale (can't recall name) This was in my opinion the nicest of the bunch with a good hoppy tang. I'm afraid I wasn't impressed with the beers though it's only my opinion. If I want really excellent craft ales I'll go to a Brewdog bar.That said, I liked the Porterhouse very much. There aren't many places where you can wander round a pub on a voyage of exploration and then get hopelessly lost on your way back from the toilets. I shan't leave it another six years.....",

You end up walking around in circles and ending up in the same place you started... What?!They've got a good selection of drinks on offer, very wide in fact, and they are reasonably priced for a pub located on the outskirts of Covent Garden. My friends used to drink in here every weekend when I lived in London and we really liked the place, it had a cool vibe and nice outside seating area (although getting a seat... good luck!)The foods 'ok', nothing special, and again, it's reasonably priced, not expensive, not cheap.The staff were always busy, and so smiles were in short supply... which is one thing I don't like - I'm really big into my customer service and I like a smile with my order... which I don't think is a big ask really. One other thing is that during the daytime, if you sit upstairs, there;s a few tables that are right out of the way and you can actually relax a little bit and enjoy yourself without all the hustle and bustle of the downstairs action. Overall a nice place, and I recommend it for a quiet drink during the weekday and a hectic evening on a nighttime, don't even get me started on a Friday and Saturday night!",

    "text": "Porterhouse is a complete maze of floors and stairs but once you've worked out how to get from your table to the bar you're fine! A couple of friends were visiting London and staying in Covent Garden a few weekends ago and we met up for Sunday lunch. Whilst deciding where to go I found it really hard to find somewhere that did a good Sunday roast and wasn't ridiculously expensive close to Covent Garden. Until we came across Porterhouse and decided to give it a go. It was really dark inside so we sat outside on the tables in front of the building. It was just about warm enough whilst we ate.The Sunday roast was good and it was great value for money for central London. It wasn't as hot as I would have liked but didn't say anything as I imagine it would have just been blasted in the microwave! It was better than some roasts I've paid double the amount for though. There is a special offer if you order two courses. We failed to order dessert at the same time to get the offer but after a little gentle persuasion they did let us order our desserts at the cheaper price afterwards which was great. I had the sticky toffee pudding and it was fairly moist and wasn't too sweet.We then moved inside as it got colder out and had a drink in the bar. Football was on one screen and gailic football was on another so it's probably a good place to watch sports if you're into that.I'd finally go again. You get a decent meal, good portion size and very reasonably priced, especially for being in Covent Garden.",

So we sat in the garden and started our drinking day. The beer here is really nice. The ales are lovely. But shockingly the lager has a distinct flavour when ususally lager kinda taste the same. I can't remember the name of the lager, but it was on draft. One of the things that bothers me about drinking in pubs in London... is they all sell the SAME beer. Your typical bitter, 2 different types of typical lager and a stout. But here you'll find something other than fosters!After about 3 pints, moved on to cocktails. I wasn't impressed. And it wasn't cheap. no boose in my cocktail and too much sugar! But overall... lovely place. In my top 10 favs!",

They have a huge selection on tap, lots of bottles in the fridges and always something for all tastes. They also have a good cider selection (and probably other tipples) - if that's your thing. If you're going to brave a noisy pub, I'd recommend you come here. The most interesting thing about this place is that it's like a maze, with lots of seating up and downstairs. Have a little explore and you'll find rooms at the back you never knew existed and little nooks and crannies you could have sworn weren't there last time. I simply love the copper pipes running everywhere. In the main bar I feel like I'm in some bustling factory, in the basement like I'm in the belly of a huge machine... I feel like a Victorian adventurer on a beer brewing, steam powered, ship. Do take a peek, the whole place is also lined with glass cabinets filled with beer bottles, you might spy some favourites. On the weekends they have live music. Great if you like live music, not so great if you want a catch up natter.",

I've avoided it whilst there has been sport on, because I can only imagine the crowds then, an it's disorientating enough in it's odd maze like fashion, without hoards of people and a good few drinks in you! It's fairly reasonable price wise, and the many sets of stairs are a great sobriety test. And even with it's size, the walls are still packed with interesting odds and ends. There's a really wide range of drinks, on one occasion I was able to drink solely different flavours of fruit beers, so yeah, there's bound to be something to your taste. There is a small amount of outdoor seating, and compared to the expanse inside, it makes it seem even less! It's definitely worth killing time in here if you're waiting for a covent garden happy hour!",

The Porterhouse is a multi-story, high-capacity Irish pub in a trendy area of London. Curse my American bias, but I'll be damned if this place's labyrinth-like interior didn't remind me of something out of Harry Potter. Although the maze of the place can be a little frustrating at times, it is also really fun. The dimly lit and crowded space supplies the charm and vigor \u00a0someone looking to kick back a pint or two with friends might be looking for. If you manage to find a seat or an area to kick back and relax, you'll find that this place's extensive beer and spirits menu has something for most to enjoy. I'm partial to craft beer and high-end whiskey, so The Porterhouse's menu was right up my alley. I enjoyed a few craft beers and a wonderful, discounted glass of Macallan. What would've been a double-digit price was only 6 pounds when the bartender indicated that they were out of their whiskey of the week. The courtesy was not lost on me. I thoroughly enjoyed the drink and it helped make my afternoon with friends a delight. Overall, The Porterhouse is an energetic and quirky spot that is certainly worth your time and curiosity. Highly recommend.",

Perhaps because I'm not a big beer drinker, I didn't think it had much to offer that you couldn't find elsewhere. A huge sprawling establishment, it's definitely useful if you're in a big group, though be sure to arrange a meeting place as it's a bit of a maze. I think what put me off was the lack of atmosphere. Perhaps it was the clientelle on the day I went, but the rowdy queues at the bar and the big groups of 'lahhhhhds' made me feel more like I was in a local Wetherspoons on a Friday night than a Covent Garden beer haven. There's nothing wrong with that but not what I expected on a Tuesday night when I was out for a (relatively) quiet drink. I'd say this place is better for big nights and loads of laughs than quiet drinks and dates. I'd be interested to see what it's like on a Friday after work - I'd imagine the queues to get to the bar are too big to even bother.",

I've been here before where they've had deals like a bucket of five beers for a tenner, or other offerings depending on what event is going on. In general, there's plenty of space if you want to go out for a drink one on one, or other areas where you can crowd around a larger area. Their front terrace is particularly good if the weather happens to be. Highly recommended!",

Being tucked down Maiden Lane means that the traffic and pedestrian crowds aren't as bad as most places in the area. There's a large patio area in front. Inside is also large, and benefits from having several areas: tables for groups, open spaces, poles with shelves for the standing drinkers, and a raised level with tables suited more to those who are eating. Food is decent here, and more like restaurant fare than just pub food. The big attraction is the selection of beers. There will always be dozens of beers on tap, half of which you'll never had heard of. And they stock bottled beers from all over the world. If you're hankering for a taste of beer from back home, there's a good chance the Porterhouse will have it. Gets very busy on evenings near the end of the week as the work crowds lets off some steam.",

Unfortunately, as its popularity has grown its standards have slipped. The good food of a few years back is now barely passable pub grub, the huge selection of beers (large enough to warrant a menu) are too often unavailable, and the whole feel of the place has changed: instead of somewhere to seek out for quality beer it now feels like a mass-market Friday night boozer, hardly different from the Walkabout across the road, which is a real shame. If you can get it when it's quieter, find a table, and try a range of beers, it's excellent, but hardly worth bothering on a Friday or Saturday night.",

With a small front terrace at the front which is very packed in the warmer months, with a very good vibe about the place. As you enter the front doors you feel instantly welcome as you walk down into a delightful decorated establishment. A pub with an unusual layout over 3 floors, you have the ground floor with a big, shiny bar and nice lighting, plenty of seating. Then down below there is cellar level which has a slightly different vibe to it and is a bit darker, with it's own bar and separated into smaller areas all around, nicely decorated with cabinets full of 'every beer imaginable' from across the globe! Then you have the windy staircase going up to the top floor where you can walk around via a balcony looking over the floor below. I just love this pub, and if you especially a lover of world beers, you will love this place. I highly recommend this place for all type of nights out, whether it's a quite mid-week beer to watching live bands in the basement on a Saturday night.",

The beer selection is wide-ranging. I was impressed with the bar tender who was able to juggle four customer orders at once and considering we'd all ordered about six drinks each it was a good effort. Generally this place gets so packed you can't move an inch so I was expecting the same last night (Wed) especially this close to Christmas but on the lower floor it wasn't so bad. We'd reserved an area as well so that helped. The only problem was the music was very loud but that was probably because we were right under a speaker.",

There are several beers on tap and the usual alcohol behind the bar. There are a number of surfaces to put your drink on or you can head out into the garden. This place was heaving when I wnet and yet service was superfast. There is a large bar area making getting service a breeze. The large inside area means there is a lot of space to find a place to gather together with friends. It is slightly hidden around the corner so don't be put off if you don't spot it. It is recessed from the road so just stick your nose around the corner and enjoy!",

During the big Ireland v England something or other match, we had to stand outside for almost an hour because it was allegedly too busy. Bouncers are complete tools as well. When I asked my friend why in the name of God she had chosen this bar to watch the match, she answered 'oh you have to come here, it's great craic' . So despite the dark gloomy interior, it is actually a great atmosphere for matches. I won't comment on the staircases 'cos if you've been to the Irish Porterhouses, you'll know that this is a standard feature. These bars are just brilliant for chilling with friends and sampling their own brews.",

This place was packed and sprawling! The beer list was impressive, with beers from many countries (except France, hah!). Downstairs there was a live band performing. On the ground floor and above (heck if I know how many floors there are) there are seats and counters all over the place, so you're bound to find somewhere to chill. It can get a little crazy and overly boisterous inside, but I suppose that's all part of the fun. It'd be a great place for groups (assuming you can find a spot).",

That's the Porter House for me. Not only is it huge and confusing with all it's nooks and in-between levels but it's always so busy in here that it's just impossible to find anyone. Don't think you can rely on your phone signal to help you out in here either...reach for your mobile and all you will see is a sad diagonal line across your reception bars indicating that there really is no way out from here. It's kind of like Hotel California.Still, if you're in a big crowd looking to watch the rugby then I would recommend the Porter House. Drink prices are what you would expect for Covent Garden but they do have a good selection of beers. If you're there early enough then you can make it up to the top floor and get a good seat with a view of one of the TV screens. Too late and you'll be stuck behind some corner listening to the cheers but not knowing who scored!",

Sadly, the Covent Garden incarnation is the, \"worst\" seems unfair, let's say: \"least good\" of the Porterhouses I've been to, but maybe that's down to the differing attitudes to drinking in Ireland and London... while the Irish will leisurely appreciate the distinctive beers on offer, with banter and craic aplenty, the London version attracts post-work boozing and shouty crowds. But, if you manage to avoid the crowds, you can still enjoy the 'home brewed' (in Ireland) brews: their stouts and porters are the highlight, but they have a version of nearly all beer types, from weiss to the darkest stouts. Plenty of the better international beers are available too. In fact with their beer menu and tasting notes, it makes for a good place to introduce someone to the wealth and range of beer flavours that are available beyond the standard lagers. Beer-lovers should visit, but leave before the crowds flood in, and go elsewhere to eat.",

There are multiple levels and several bars dotted around. The wine list had some nice wines on it, but what you really go there for is the huge selection of beers on offer. That said, my glass of NZ sauv was great. I think next time I go there I'll go for the beer tasting option, which gives you a selection of beers to try.The outdoor seating area is a bit hit and miss \u00a0I think they need to rethink their chair and table options to make the place look a bit more welcoming, classy and a bit less like the cheap seats you get in a classroom. It's scrappy and could do better with some larger wooden picnic style tables rather than tiny little two seaters.",

    "text": "I guess mostly everyone else has glossed over the fact that this is a microbrewery, first and foremost, started in Dublin, Ireland. In fact, The Porterhouse is the largest Irish-owned brewery in all of Ireland. Guinness is, in fac,t no longer Irish and is part of a giant conglomerate of breweries that primarily sponsor sporting events rather than focus on quality beers.The Porterhouse Covent Garden is an impressive pub with many nooks and crannies to enjoy a nice pint with friends. My favorite is the Wrasslers XXXX Stout followed closely by the Plain Porter. '4X' as it's known, is a lovely Irish stout with a fresh, rich and creamy taste and a nice full head that you would expect from a beer of this style. Wrasslers \u00a0that I'm sure at some point Guinness once resembled. In my opinion, 4X is THE best Irish stout, hands down. I've imbibed a fair bit of Wrasslers in one go and I must say it was the only time I did not get a rotten hangover that is usually associated with a long night with Guinness.If a stout isn't your thing, give the Plain Porter a shot, it's lighter and quicker drinking if you're out for a long session with friends. If THAT'S not your thing, then try Brain Bl\u00e1sta for a lovely blast of 7% ABV to your head in the form of a malty-sweet ale that resembles those made famous by Belgian monks. Further down the line, the Oyster Stout must be tasted to be fully understood (it's made from real oysters) and the Temple Brau lager is the only lager I would dream of drinking in an Irish pub. The Porterhouse Red is a lovely Irish red ale that puts Smithwicks (Diageo/Guinness) to shame. My only gripe is that The Porterhouse beer is not available anywhere else but their pubs. But I guess that's what makes them so much more special...I only gave The Porterhouse Covent Garden 4 stars simply because the best is still the Original in Dublin's famous Temple Bar cultural quarter on Parliament Street.As for the other beers not reviewed: Hersbrucker, TSB, and Chiller, I have not tasted them so I won't review them for now. So it looks like I'm due for another trip to The Porterhouse microbrewery...",

It's a large place with staircases winding up and down to various floors that hold plenty of nooks and crannies to sit in which creates a really great place to enjoy a drink. In the summer they set up a barbeque outside which always attracts a big crowd. \u00a0The beer range is incredible here-there's all kinds of weird and wonderful beers and ales to try and they have a pretty extensive food menu offering oysters, mussels and some fine burgers and pizzas all at prices that won't break the bank. I love Porterhouse because being there becomes an experience rather than just going out for a drink as you become intrigued to try all of their offerings and the building itself is great to be in and explore. It's a perfect place to take a group of friends because there's plenty of large tables and seating areas. Porterhouse is always busy and I can totally understand why-this is one of my top pubs to visit in London.",
