    "text": "We came here to take advantage of the \u00a35 ramen special offer, which they had during their opening month. \u00a0Clearly everyone else was thinking the same thing: the restaurant was packed and it was a lively atmosphere. \u00a0It was possibly too loud for my liking and the service was a bit delayed, but I was pleased with the food.We asked for a pint of Kirin ichiban each and ordered a feast to share for dinner. \u00a0We usually order a lot, but I think we went a bit crazy this time because of the ramen bargain sale.We first had a starter of cold pork slices on a bed of rice with \"bonus prizes\" of pickles and a little heart shaped, light pink, nugget of fish roe. \u00a0We both mistook it for sour plum on sight, but we happily ate it when we knew what it was.Next came more starters of pork gyozas and whitebait karaage. We were a bit confused when the whitebait arrived because they looked very different to what we are used to back in NZ. \u00a0These looked more like fried sardines, yet they weren't sardines. \u00a0They were tasty and went well with my beer. \u00a0The gyoza were passable, but I wouldn't write home to Mum about them. \u00a0My wife commented on the very finely chopped ginger in the dipping sauce.The ramen were the stars of the dinner, as they should be. \u00a0My wife had the Shoryu Ganso, which is their signature ramen. \u00a0This looked great! \u00a0I only got to have a few spoonfuls of the milky broth which was so flavourful. \u00a0I had the Hokkaido curry ramen. \u00a0If you want to combine a ramen with karaage chicken, then I recommend this one. The broth, of course, was curry flavoured and it was not as thick as we thought it may be. \u00a0In each ramen, the half egg was not as good as other places were have visited. \u00a0Each table has a bowl full of whole garlics, which you can peel and crush to add to your ramen.Total price was near \u00a338, but I would expect it to be closer to \u00a350 when ramen prices are back to normal. \u00a0This is typical for London ramen restaurants that we have visited.",

A lot of work needs to be done.",

    "text": "Sorry, Shoryu, you've lost a valued customer. We wanted a table for 9 at lunch, or even a bit after lunch and it's piccadilly so it's not full of suits, so don't tell me I should suck it up and accept that we should split apart to sit. I understand it's busy especially for a 9 man who didn't book. But I asked if I could have the table that looked like they were finished because the bowls were polished off and they would have left in like 5 minutes tops because they were looking around for the bill. I asked nicely if I could wait for that table and I got a 'but I can't push them', I'm not asking you to push, but I would really appreciate it if we could sit together. It was the kerfuffle that pissed me off. read more below.I accepted that this, and then they sat half of us on in the middle of a long table where my guests had to ask the guests at the side of the table to move in to get in, causing more problems and sat three of us at a table where people were still slurping down the last of their ramen? Surely letting us wait 5 minutes for 2 tables together would have been better? Despite that, my guests all enjoyed it, commented on the lovely soup base, which for me, was a little bit too salty. The Hirata Buns have definitely got worse. The pork belly was dry, and the mayo didnt save it. I ordered for my table and they got our orders mixed up with the other half of my party, which just annoyed me because if they sat us together, wouldnt have happened because they obviously put us on the same order, at least brief the staff, the kitchen was right in front of us, so they could have pointed where we were? That's just carelessness. I mean, I didn't mind sharing but seriously?!?",

    "text": "After Bone Daddies last week, I was a little bit underwhelmed by Shoryu. The pluses are for the decor, which is really nice and sit-down versus the tall stools and awkward seating around the wall situation at Bone Daddies. They also seem to have a very good selection of cocktails and sushi, for those who are not there for the ramen. The tables had the same garlic crushers and sesame grinders that Bone Daddies had; this makes me think that ramen is becoming a trendy thing here in London, much like it has in New York. The menu had options for different ways you could have your ramen cooked- just dunked in for a second, a bit firm, medium, well done, etc. I ordered the Origin Tonkotsu, because I think the best way to get a feel for the restaurant is to start with what they do best. The pork was good but not great, and the only other toppings were mushroom and spring onion, which did not add that much to the meal. I thought the broth was average too- decent for a high end ramen place but nothing really made it stand out, which is true of the whole place in general.",

    "text": "On a cold day in London, on New Years Day, my mates and I decided to have some Ramen in SoHo. On our way to the underground while waiting to cross the street, we saw a quaint ramen place and decided to have that for dinner on our way back. After walking for what seemed like miles on end with terrible hangovers, well at least I had one, we finally made it to Shoryu. Luckily there was not a line like what we saw earlier. The atmosphere is quite cozy, and it was communal seating. I don't mind that, it's just something that you don't see a lot of from where I come from. Looking at the menu I wanted every single thing on there, but went with the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. I was not disappointed, and neither will you if you try this signature bowl of ramen. The pork belly and the egg were cooked just right, and the broth was flavorful! I got my noodles med, not too hard or soft, and was suggested by our server. I love how they still keep the Japanese feel by the staff saying \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f while you head out the door feeling full. They also have more locations around the town, so if you ever come to London especially on a cold day, then I recommend Shoryu, you won't regret it!",

The restaurant manager saw us and invited us in but explained that we had to wait a while as they officially open at 5pm for the evening. We did not expect to experience a true Japanese hospitality :)Food arrived a while later and the restaurant started to get packed. We ordered two appetisers; ~Satsuma Age (salted fried fish cake)I was not keen on Satsuma Age, just another fish ball.~Hirata Buns BBQ pork belly (steamed buns filled with shoryu spicy meat or fish, greens & qp mayo)Buns were awesome! I did not know that steamed buns could look very burger-like and tasted so delicious! \u00a36 for 2 buns was definitely worth it! A must try :DFire & Ice Salmon Tsukemen (medium chumen noodles cold ramen with a warm wasabi-tonkotsu dipping sauce, bbq pork, isle of ewe hot smoked salmon and nitamago) at \u00a312.50. This may look a little on the pricey side but trust me, when it arrives in front of you, you will know it's worth! Cold ramen (with real ice below it) comes with BBQ pork and smoked salmon. Dipped the ramen, pork and salmon into the hot sauce. Mouth watering...Something classic: Tori Kara-Age Men (medium chumen noodles (original) gluten free rice noodles, shiitake & konbu soy broth with gluten free aka miso, fried chicken, nitamago, kikurage, nori, kelp, mushrooms, spring onion and fish cake) at \u00a310.90 is a real bargain. Love the fried chicken :)I used to go to Ittenbari for cheap & cheerful meals but now I would definitely recommend Shoryu to ramen lovers :)))",

    "text": "I'm still really unconvinced by Ramen. I'm really not sure what the big deal is. After my first Ramen experience everyone told me that Shoyru was the place to go, but again I was underwhelmed.First. I get why they have communal tables. It feels very Japanese. However, it also feels like you're being squished into a small table with a bunch of strangers. There's just not a lot of room. Second. The service is really poor. They provide wet naps that clearly say to use before eating, but then they just leave them sitting on the table through your meal. The people who were at the table had used all the garlic and left a messy garlic press at the table, but the servers don't feel the need to bring a clean one or replenish the garlic when there is none left.The best thing about the meal were the pork buns. Tasty, but not as good as Yum Bun (yeah I said it). The ramen is quite bland. Maybe that's just how ramen is? Mine was slightly better as I got the piri piri so it was spicier, but the pork belly was a bit tough and the best thing was the egg. It seems like it should just be better when you're paying \u00a311+ for what is basically a bowl of noodle soup. The chicken kara age was alright. The rice balls had a tasty filling, but the rice itself was bland.All in all, I'm not sure what this Ramen trend is about. So far it hasn't really proven to me that I wouldn't just be better off eating sushi and other, more tasty Japanese food. I'm not sure I'll be giving any Ramen places another chance, but you never know.",

One day I had the curry chicken ramen and it was absolutely amazing. The broth was so flavorful and the noodles perfectly cooked. The other time I decided to go for the vegetarian option with a veggie broth, no meat but tofu instead. Thought it was good but definitely less tasty than the chicken one. I guess you ask for it if you want tofu..Appreciate the gluten-free noodles option and the vegetarian broth that some other ramen places do not offer though!The wait (no reservation) can be quite annoying if it is raining/freezing outside - just think about the amazing warm dish you'll soon have to get you through the wait - however there are lots of sitting so it usually is not so bad.One star off because my first time there the waiter brought us the wrong bill and we only noticed we paid double amount after the card had gone through. Always go over the billIn a nutchell: I am a new ramen fan",

    "text": "This place is meh and I write that with great regret as one of my close friends absolutely adores this place.I think the problem begins with my predisposition as a Chinese and Vietnamese noodle lover. I like big flavours, fragrance and spice and I just don't GET ramen. I don't get it. So now you know my shameful secret, you'll understand that my review is probably a little bit biased and I'm sorry about that because I always try to be as objective as possible but this time it's not necessarily all that possible.That is not to say that Shoryu is doing anything wrong because the food here is excellent and I am actually quite a fan of the fire and ice ramen. It's a dish you should probably make sure you have medical coverage for as the hot part really is VERY hot. The cocktails here are delicious and I will admit to spending more on cocktails here than I did I on my food on more than one occasion. However, having said all of that, I just can't call myself a fan of the ramen here. I don't know if ramen is like this everywhere (in my experience in London, it is) but I wish that there were some bigger flavours. I appreciate that Japanese cuisine can be very subdued with an emphasis on natural flavours in synergy but really, I just want something with a little more substance to it and I haven't found it here. It's not from a lack of trying as I've been here at least 5 or 6 times. Perhaps a Japanese curry noodle? I know that exists as I have a Japanese friend who raves about it. So I have to apologise for a mediocre review as the fault probably lies with me entirely but let's try to highlight some of the things I definitely think Shoryu could do better. The main problem I have with this new location is the seating. Dear LORD, the seating. Does it have to be so... efficient? I would like to be able to sit at a table that has chairs, real chairs and is not arranged into a giant communal table that must be shared by 3 separate parties. Literally every single time I walk into the restaurant I pray (I'm an atheist) that they will seat us at a table that's not pushed up against another table. It's an experience reminiscent of the primary school dining hall experience where you are elbow to elbow with your neighbours and there's nothing you can do about it. At least in those days you were likely friends with the kid next to you. \u00a0 This brings me to my very last point. Hirata buns. I have never had the heart to tell my aforementioned close friend that Hirata buns are actually a Chinese food which became extremely popular in Taiwan and received an adopted Japanese name and twist. I'm from Northern China so I know what it tastes like back home and I know that it doesn't have mayonnaise in it and that the meat should be indulgently fatty, juicy and melt in your mouth with hints of spices. I don't feel the Hirata here delivers and have yet to find any place in London where the Hirata buns do. Unfortunately Shoryu's buns have become the standard by which many will set their personal standards and I feel that that's a huge shame. I will try to set aside my memories of an authentic bun and simply say that I don't like the fact that these buns are drenched in mayonnaise, it's pretty gross and I find that the meat lacks flavour. It's also quite inconsistent and will sometimes arrive to the table cold.I want to love this place. I want to love ramen and I want want want to love Hirata buns but I just don't.",

(I had a feeling that the noodle had not been cooked well)Overall, it's not a bad restaurant. It's much better than Wagamama at least. Europeans and British people may love it. Asians will have different opinions. To me, it's NOT BAD. Still, it is not satisfactory enough. Oh, one more thing. NEVER EAT THEIR ONIGIRI. Especially the one with brown rice. It was the worst food made of rice in my life.",

I love the fact that they offer complimentary sesame seeds and garlic. The restaurant is cozy, it looks like a genuine Japanese restaurant, and prices are moderate (not cheap, not expensive). However, the Japanese that the waiters speak is very fake (Japanese with Italian accent?). In addition, there was a waiter hitting a kind of drums that sounds like an African instrument. Please, I recommend the restaurant to stop this very fake things. But definitely I am happy I tried Shoryu!",

The space is nicely laid out with two rooms separated out by a door at the corner. Creative in their ramen with things like wasabi ramen and piri piri tonkotsu. I eventually ended up with the Matcha Ganso Tonkotsu. Miso broth was nice, but nothing very memorable. The noodles weren't very memorable as well. I was underwhelmed.Service was a bit weird as they made awkward conversation and didn't really understand what we were trying to say to them. It was rather annoying the few times the server came by.

    "text": "The tail of two broths.I recently went to House of Ho on Old Compton St and had a bowl of noodle soup.I think the way they made it was like this...Take dried noodles from a packet. Add luke warm tap water, a bit of urine and serve with a sprig of crusty mint, a handful of beansprouts and some raw beef shavings.I made like Gandhi and drank it down. It was so insipid and tepid I instantly removed it from my memory.Then the other day I went to this place and as I made my way through the unctuous broth to the beautifully tender noodles with bite and creaminess I was reminded of the crappiness of the House of Ho version and how good a bowl of soup noodles can actually be.Shoryu Ramen has its faults. Shit service for one. And the layout is higgldy piggldy. Two restaurants knocked into one. It's pretty hard to get the attention of any of the servers, who seem to be made up of those foreign exchange students who were turned away from Pret because they wouldn't smile. But throw something at them or turn the menu into a megaphone and you'll be treated to a mighty delicious bowl of soup noodles. Every ingredient - and there are loads - has its own taste and texture. From the just set egg to the seaweedy bits near the bottom. The pork I had in mine came in delicate fine slivers which tasted beautifully meaty and added to the umaminess of the whole thing. Absolutely delicious. We also had the steamed buns cos it was a Monday two for one offer. And they were delicious too. Light and fluffy with juicy tempura prawns and a tasty mayonnaise. The whole thing was melt in your mouth double niceness. I have heard that this place is a complete mare around lunchtimes with people queueing round the block and service apparently much worse than when we went in late afternoon. I totally believe it but would encourage people not to be put off. Just go when it's not so busy. The place won't provide you with much comfort but the food really does.",

We were seated in half an hour and the service was pretty good. In fact, the vibe here was a bit more relaxed than bone daddies where I felt this pressure to scram as soon as I finished my meal. The space itself also felt a bit more open and though small with the expected communal seating arangement I didn't quite feel like a sardine.For the starter my friend and I immediately honed in on the Hirata Buns - but they had completely run out- understandably as it is one of their most popular starters. We then decided to try the soft shell crab which was OK, a bit of a let down as it was a bit clumpy and not light and crispy as I would have liked. (Bone Daddies definitely rocked the Soft Shell Crab though)The Ramen was absoluteIy a delightful sight. I got the Dracula, which true to its description, was very garlicy. I do like my garlic but even for me the flavour was a tad overwhelming. But other than that, it was delicious. The broth was rich, creamy and extremely satisfying. The waitress also recommended Fire & Ice Salmon Tsukemen which sounded very interessting which I will certainly try on my next visit.I really liked the traditional/industrial vibe of this place a bit more relaxed than your usual no reservation kind of place. Food was good- but not the best Ramen I've had in London.",

When it comes to tonkotsu, the broth has to be spot-on: creamy, milky, lusciously fatty, with a specific textural note that only cooked bone marrow can impart after hours and hours of slow simmering.This place wasn't transcendental but, then again, I didn't expect it to be. Don't expect their tonkotsu selection to blow your mind, but do expect a better-than-average quick bite. Skip the gyoza, do opt for the pork belly buns.The ramen itself was decent, but the broth was a touch salty (too much miso) and lean (not enough pork fat). The ramen noodles, as others have noted, were a touch firm; I think they use a noodle closer to soba than true ramen, because I was getting distinct buckwheat topnotes. The pork was really nice; I wish there'd been more than three slices of it, but that's how these things tend to go.Service was mostly fine, though a bit inattentive when it came time to get the check, and nobody offered us drinks/dessert after our meal.",

I am neither a ramen nor a sake connoiseur, the recommendations of \"sake sommelier Mimi\" were wasted on me, nevertheless, I hope this review will be useful to fellow casual walk in ramen consumers.The chalkboard by the entrance had advertised \"Frozen Beer\" in large letters, which was a cunning move on a hot summer's day. Two half pints were swiftly ordered along with 2 cups of sake while we settled down to decipher an interesting menu.Interestingly, customers can specify how cooked the noodles are, however, having already ordered a cold bowl of noodles (Hakata Chilled Reimen), I thought I should restrict myself to one \"experimental\" feature per meal.The food was served in good time and service was efficient, but always friendly and didn't feel rushed. My noodles were absolutely fine, good even, it was well presented, the texture of the noodles was not mushy, \u00a0the portion size was good, the broth was flavourful and there was enough pork. At \u00a310.90 for what some have described as \"a bowl of noodles\", I suppose this is the least one would expect. On the other hand, it did seem like more had gone into it than in a \u00a35 bowl of roast pork and flat rice noodles from Wong Kei for instance. (Also, just did a price check and a Wagamama Ramen goes for \u00a39.95)All in all, it was a good meal at slightly above average prices, so handy for tourists and anyone who finds themselves on Piccadilly Circus with a craving for noodles and sake, but I wouldn't seek it out especially.Oh, and the frozen beer was not what we imagined, but a glass of not particularly ice cold Kirin with a stiff, almost slushy like head.",

I was a HUGE MJ fan when I was a kid and thought why not..) for a snack and a beer because I was starving!I ordered the 2 buns: chicken and prawn buns, and chikuwa cheese fishcakes for a snack and a 1/2 pint of Kirin. The buns took a while to come out but the fluffiness of the buns was well worth the wait. I preferred the buns at Yum Bun in Shoreditch but seeing that it was late and I didn't have a lot of time left in London, I needed to satiate my bun craving sooner. The ingredients inside the buns need a bit of work as it was very plain. I think the prawn tempura bun was tastier and had a little more flavor than the chicken. The chikuwa cheese fishcakes were a good pairing with the beer but there was no sauce to dip the fishcakes in. Overall, my snack was pretty bland but my beer was cold and people watching from the booth seating was good. Maybe next time I'm in London, I'll try some ramen.",

There's no denying that their soup base is good, it's not ridiculously rich like bone daddies but you get enough to order another portion of noodles when you're feeling hungry. You get the choice of tenacity with noodles, so if it's not to your liking, well, it's your own fault.The starters (I've had the salmon okra, the fried chicken, the Hirata buns), are all okay, but over-priced. If it were just the noodles I would give Shoryu an easy 4 stars. However, some of the flavours are a bit hit and miss. I never understood the yuzu ramen, which is sad, being both yuzu and a ramen lover.All in all though, generally happy with the tonkotsu based ramen, the tonkotsu flavours comes out well in all of them, even the curry ramen.Do visit, everyone I talk to has their Shoryu/Bone Daddies/Tonkotsu/Ittenbaru allegiance.

I came with a party of 4 around 7PM on a Friday, and our wait was only 5 min! We ordered soon after we sat down, and our server was quick to refill our glasses (something that doesn't seem to be the case at many other London restaurants).I ordered their original (11 quid), which came with lots of noodles in a sumptuous shoryu broth accompanied with seaweed, thick juicy slices of pork belly, lots of green onions, and the perfect half-cooked soy sauce egg. You can add spicy chili oil, freshly ground sesame seeds and even crush your own garlic to add into your soup. The ramen was served in a pretty large bowl, and I was stuffed by the end. A friend added extra noodles in his soup, which only cost 1.60 pounds extra, so I'd recommend doing that if you're hungry.They also seemed to have skewered meats and various buns on their menu, but I'll have to come another time to try those out!Tl;dr - convenient, delicious ramen near Picadilly Circus.",

They're super accommodating and patient and carefully note any changes you want to make to the order. I ordered the natural ramen with matcha hosumen (green noodles) and asked for the \"hard\" noodles. I loved the broth, which was light but flavorful and tasted like a mix between mushrooms and miso. However, the noodles were pretty well-cooked and definitely did not have the texture I was expecting. Also, some of the noodles were clumpy and undercooked while some were soft and overcooked.The noodles came with mushroom, shredded ginger, carrot, bean sprouts, spinach and tofu. It was definitely really good ramen, only I wish it had been more consistent throughout! Also, I had a bite of my friend's egg and I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GET ONE if your noodles don't include it! Overall, for 11 pounds (12.50 after service charge) it was a great deal and pretty high quality food. I definitely recommend this place if you're craving ramen!(The normal most popular one comes with pork broth instead and has slices of pork, bean sprouts, some other vegetables and half an egg. This one's 12 pounds, so they're all around the same price!",

    "text": "So the word on the street is that Shoryu has been opened by the Japan Centre, so off I went for lunch with a friend.The place is sleek looking, black design, dual store space, although the tables are slightly cramped together. At lunch time it was super busy, must be a testament to how good its food is.I believe I had the dracula ramen (can't remember - see photo) and I remember the broth was quite mild but I prefer this broth to the broth at Tonkotsu and at Bonedaddies. The egg however, pales in comparison to the runny yolk amazingness that is the egg at Bonedaddies. It is not too thick and creamy, how this compares to authentic Japanese I could not say, but it was nice and gentle to my sensitive stomach.Drinks on the other hand could do with some work. My lunch mate's drink tasted horrible, and mine was just decent. It felt like too much ice went in so it went a bit too watery. Please introduce some nice drinks for people like me, I have a super sweet tooth. I do not really care that much if the drink is super unhealthy :)Overall, I think I would come back here again, maybe to try the hirata bun, but Flesh & Buns come first for that.",

I was by myself in London so they sat me by the window, which was great for people watching in Picadilly Circus. I ordered the hirata bun (chicken) to try and their signature ramen (I forgot the name). I liked that they asked how I wanted my noodles cooked - hard, little hard or standard. The bun didn't impress me, there was too much sauce, super messy and the chicken wasn't that flavorful, it was just fried. The ramen was mediocre, the broth was okay... overall it didn't taste bad but I've had better.",

    "text": "After queuing for a bit outside because they do not take reservations, we were finally sat at a counter in front of a window and were immediately given our menus accompanied by the recommendation of the waitress. After we ordered (both ramen and sides), the ramen arrived about 5 minutes after we had ordered (making me think they have massive pots of that stuff just waiting to be served). The presentation was gorgeous, but I didn't remember to take a picture because I begun wolfing it down as soon as I could. About 10 minutes after that, our sides (a pork bun and a mixed side platter) arrived which allowed for a very welcome, but not necessary change in texture. The ramen had so many bits floating in it (pork, prawn, egg, mushroom etc.) that it didn't feel like just soup. I should mention that the mixed platter that I picked (Soho platter if I recall correctly), whilst incredibly tasty, had a spinach cake of sorts dripping in peanut sauce which was not announced anywhere in the menu. I'm allergic to peanuts, and I'm lucky to have asked before, because I was ready to eat that tasty-looking spinach cake.Towards the end of the meal, it was a bit difficult to get their attention to ask for the bill, as it looks like they were slightly understaffed.Overall, incredible food, very pleasant personnel, quick service (mostly). I just wish they would take reservations so I wouldn't have to queue. Would strongly recommend to anyone.",

There is a more space at this location and the furniture and airiness just feels cozy.The Piri Piri broth was spicy and flavorful but from what I remember, my tasting of this dish at the Regent St location was better. Also, similar to the Regent St. location, I think that the fried chicken could have a crispier crust. Other than that, the dish had nice juicy white tender chunks and came with some spicy powder and Japanese mayo.

    "text": "Most people so far will have tried this place as a result of the superbly generous 50% off ramen deal. As a result will have missed out on some of the starters. This review is partly to tell you don't, as the Hirata buns are unmissable.Service is not normally one of my complaints (food is king amongst all) But when it affects me getting a free starter, it's gonna make it into my review D:Basically we queued for a while then were taken to our seats by a man that reminded me very much of Mr Miyagi from the Karate kid (no offense to anyone intended) with a friendly smile and similar dress. There we were left. Nobody attempted to ask us if we wanted drinks, nor were we given any menu. So we just kind of sat there a while till we decided it was becoming a joke and asked for menus. Once ordering, we looked around and little plates of raw cabbage were being handed to every new group that was being seated around us. Now I didn't remotely want or have a need for cabbage at the time, but if you don't get something everyone else is getting, then it's a matter of principle. This really annoyed our group.Anyway, this poor service is reflected in the 4 stars.The food itself with no feelings to hurt, was a different story. Stunning. The starters, Hirata buns with bbq pork, chicken and salmon were TASTY. Think soft white chinese steam buns flat and folded in half. I ate two by myself and they aren't small. We also got the soft shell tempura crab which was okay. That extra hirata bun and the crab was a small mistake along with ordering 1 ramen and an extra to share with the group. \u00a0After all 50% off means you should eat 50% more right???Well the ramen soon arrived and I was around 40% full but looking forward to the delicious Hokkaido curry ramen that had been smelling so good on the table for a while. The chicken karate well crispy, despite being submerged in hot soup. The pork broth still standing out against what appeared to taste like katsu curry. I was convinced I had ordered the best dish. The noodles were particularly nice. Good texture and firmness without getting soggy throughout the meal. The cold ramen is also good. The chilled spicy mince sauce was different to anything I've tasted as a dipping sauce with flavours hard to identify, but citrus was quite strong. Anyway, I was sad that our group couldn't finish the extra bowl of cole ramen.Anyways, I hope to go back, hopefully before the 50% promotion ends :) We shall not make the same mistakes we did on this visit and over-order with some luck.",

It has a cute and cozy feel to the atmosphere. \u00a0I love that they have baskets underneath the table so you can store your bags and jackets. \u00a0Reminds me of something you'd probably see in Japan. \u00a0There's a huge bowl of whole garlic, chili oil, soy, vinegar and sesame seed grinder. \u00a0The bowls came out real quick! \u00a0I throw in a big of sesame, chili oil and take my first sip of the soup with my spoon that looks like a wooden paddle. \u00a0Heaven. \u00a0Its the kind of flavor that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside and you start to smirk to yourself like a crazy person. \u00a0It takes me back to my trip to Japan. \u00a0Dunno if the place on regent street is this good but this definitely is my favorite ramen spot in London. \u00a0Yes sir, may I have another?",

    "text": "Frozen beer. Frozen beer?! Frozen beer!I was a little worse for wear after a two-day wedding in the countryside, but thought that warm ramen with cool friends would be the perfect tonic (or tonkotsu) to what ailed me. Little did I know there would be a scientifically improbable but utterly delectable frozen beer in the mix. I was in no shape for a drink at the time, but the little taste I got of my buddy's frozen beer was enough for me to make a mental commitment to return for one of my own. I don't usually get excited about mass-produced lager, but I imagine this ice-flecked pint is what Santa orders after a long day in the North Pole.Our pork dumplings came out potsticker-style, and were both extremely tasty and extremely hot. Since they seemed to be bursting with juicy goodness, I popped the first one into my mouth whole. Unfortunately, I housed it before it was cool enough to comfortably chew, and spent about 30 long seconds unable to answer my friend's question while navigating what to do about the tasty and painful predicament on my tongue. Luckily, we ordered two each, so I was able to enjoy the second one after giving it a good seven-minute grace period.My Natural Ramen set-up could have used a few more greens for my taste, but I was glad that the corn kernels were fresh, and the tofu was silken yet solid. Most importantly, the ramen noodles were my ideal consistency--perhaps the best texture I've had in town.I agree with Ada G. that the servers are super nice here--as is typical in English restaurants, we had a slight wait in getting someone to bring the water (which would have been useful during my potsticker predicament), and later, the bill, but they checked my leather duffel and gave me a claim ticket without batting an eye.Summer might be gone in London, but I really hope the frozen beer stays!",

Coming from NYC where ramen shops are popping up every corner and have been to Japan multiple times, I couldn't say Shoryu is in the top tier. But with all fairness, it is above average among ramen shops outside of Japan. I was introduced to the shoryu by a friend when I visited London last week. We went to the one on Denman street on a Friday night. Busy but the wait time wasn't too bad, prob about 20 mins. For comparison, the wait time for Ippudo or other somewhat decent ramen shops are at least 45 mins. I tried the Kimchi Seafood Tonkotsu which, instead of the traditional char siu topping, came with loads of seafood, amago, Kikurage, Nori, Spring Onion, Beansprouts, Sesame & Fried Shallots. The broth was rich and though not as spicy as I would prefer, warming me up tip to toe on this cold winter night in London. We also took the sake flight which was pretty good value - for under 10 pounds you got 4 shorts of sake - junmai and ginjo, I believe. I also tried the White Natural at Regent Street location during lunch the other day. It was vegetarian friendly - ramen in a Shiitake & Konbu Gluten Free Soy Broth. it was light yet packed with flavor; feels very healthy. Perfect for lunch. Best part - quick and no wait. Services at both locations were consistently good. Will definitely come back next time in London.",

I tried the the kotteri hakata tonkatsu ramen....as recommended in the menu, I ordered extra egg topping to fill in my bowl. I also have shoryu bun as my side. I am just like an hungry ghost tonight cannot wait to get feed after a week of hunger. The taste of the ramen broth is super delicious. And the bun with pork belly taste fantastic. The food price is average with a good portion of serving. I love to visit here again to try their summer menu and the cocktails list.",

Upon being seated, it took the wait staff quite some time before even taking our order. It was a simple order for my group of three: a Shoryu steam bun for my sister, Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu for my brother, and a Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu for myself. \u00a0I should note that a table of two sat down about 15 minutes after us. They somehow got their food way before us, and it looked suspiciously like exactly what my group ordered. Even the two people looked confused but ate it anyway. We eventually had to wave down our waiter and ask where our dishes were. Sure enough, they mistakenly gave it to another table. Once we did get our ramen, it was actually quite delicious. A nice smooth creamy broth. They could have turned the ginger down a notch though. I had a hard time shaking off the service (or lack thereof). I mean, not once did anybody check on us to see how everything was. Would I go again? Probably not. While the ramen was good, service makes up a good part of an experience - and they missed the mark there.",

I got their signature ramen, I've never had tasteless tonkatsu broth before but I guess they watered down whatever they had to make this soupy grossness. It was basically noodles with a million bits of chives. The char Sui in the noodle wasn't bad but it didn't compensate for the broth or the noodles. I was thoroughly impressed with how bad it was. Only giving it 2 stars because my male server was so nice, the female server was terrible she literally threw people's dishes down in front of them",

I can never remember what it's called but it truly was full of flavour. I've had prawn tempura and the Pork bun and chicken one (yes I'm a greedy one) I always get the pork ramen noodles. last time however, I tried the Seafood one which was really nice it had like prawns scallops and mussels I think I can't remember haha but yes it was yum. This place never disappoints, it's also great because it's healthy and fresh and if you just want something that's low in calories or not your typical fast food and you don't go overboard it's a nice little something that's easy on the pockets and fills you up, so generally all smiles I can't complain.

The location is a lot more spacious than its other location and not to mention to ramen is stays true to its authenticity in terms of flavour, toppings, and those extra dingalings you get to add on to your bowl for that extra kick.Mushroom with tofu and their fishcake starters are rather oily.. Was rather disappointed with their fishcake when it came in form of those rolled ready made ones you can get in supermarkets. The cheese wasn't particular either. As for the ramen. Oh bless me, I'm already salivating. Dracula Tonkotsu's broth was as described, thick, and bowl full of flavour. The pork based soup tasted a bit fatty.. But in a good and authentic way. The full on toppings also didn't disappoint. I'll give the quality of their thin noodle 4.5 stars. Either way, it tasted heavenly, heavily garlicy, and should never be ordered if you're on a date. Their ramen ranges from \u00a39.50 to \u00a311.50, I'm stuffed, though the price is a little steep for ramen don't you think? But again, this is London. You're eating Japanese in London. Europe. God, how I miss those cheaply billed New York days.. My second visited called for a miso based broth which I had secretly regretted after glazing over my friend's bowl of Char Shui tonkotsu. And hell yea there were so many pieces of char shui my friend literally said-- 'can't deal'. Oh, and sights of some Japanese eating there, so that should be a good confirmation right? Overall, Ichiban Y'ALL!",

I went with the vegetable ramen, so my review might be a bit more skewed, considering that original ramen is made with animal stock. But it was still pretty good, and the portions are generous. Still, I think having gone to quite a few ramen shops I thought this was just your average ramen restaurant that was over-priced. The buns that we got on a deal were a big letdown, unfortunately. Not much flavour and the bun as a bit tougher than I would have preferred.In conclusion, a reliable place that will will satisfy your ramen craving MUCH more than a chain like Wagama, but I wouldn't be raving about it as much.",

It was a cold damp day, classic London weather, and we were hankering for a quick bite before heading out to an Arsenal football game and a big meal later that night. When we tried to open the door, people were spilling out due to the line! But the host managed to seat us all quite quickly as they turn tables over at a rapid pace. We split the spicy miso vegetarian ramen bowl and added seaweed and kimchi. I sipped on a special higher priced green tea and my husband enjoyed a matcha. The choices of ramen range from traditional with pork and a poached egg to vegetarian options. They also have sushi rolls and other Asian specialties. I was blown away by the flavors and that our spicy miso broth was not nearly as salty as I expected. The noodles were yummy and my tea was warm with great depth of flavor. I don't know how this place compares to other local ramen joints but our experience here was really very good and I would certainly come back for more traditional ramen when we are a bit hungrier.",

I think this locatoin tries to be hip and cool...and the strange thing is that I didn't see one single worker of Japanese decent and everyone was repeating the same Japanese phrases (i.e., Irasshaimase, Arigato, Doitashimashite).Shoryu offers two vegan ramen options (hooray)! However, I ordered the vegan spicy ramen and left slightly disappointed. Why you might ask? Well, because the tofu and broccoli were very cold. I suspect they premade these items and neglected to keep them warm / warm them up. This made the dish much less enjoyable, but given that I hadn't had a proper meal in 24 hours, I ate it. However, I probably won't be back when there's tons of other nearby vegan-friendly places.",

    "text": "I have been a loyal Shoryu customer since 2014, when I used to travel to Picadilly Circus from Liverpool Street area, just to eat at their restaurant. I have previously been happy with their expansion, but unfortunately all three times I have eaten at this location, the service has been very poor. The first time was at dinner after work, the server got my table's ramen orders swapped. You can't swap back soup. I took it as a minor error in a restaurant I usually love. Strike two: I ordered ramen at lunch, expressed that I was within time constraints, and didn't manage to get the attention of a server until they came for the bill. This was a problem because my Ramen came room temperature. I had to eat it, because I was short on time, but I asked for a manager and let them know the problem. She wrote a note on the receipt saying next ramen free. I did not use it, but the gesture was appreciated.Final Strike for this location: I went yesterday for lunch with 35 minutes to eat, I communicated to the server before being seated that this was my constraint, and asked if it would be possible to eat and leave within that time. She said that it would, and I ordered a pork bun and a ramen. Bun came, I ate it, twiddled my thumbs, and started watching the clock and the kitchen. I could see that things were slower in the kitchen, the chef had to tell a line cook that the buns needed to be swapped for fresh ones in the steamer, from what I heard, so I believe what the serving staff told me, that they were short staffed in the kitchen. That is fine, but do not communicate to me that you can serve me quickly when I ask, and at least offer to bring my food all at once, instead of coursing it, when I say I am in a hurry. Not only did they add insult to injury by bringing my food in the bowl after I was insisting on paying for the food served and telling them I needed to leave quickly, so I know it was disappointingly wasted, but they did not offer to box it up to take with me as a measure of goodwill. I did not eat anything else for lunch that day. They passed me through management and only the final server did not argue with me. Do not waste a customers time when they have to go. I worked in five extra minutes to my time frame, but you ate into that by arguing with me, I had to jog back to work. My friend suggested this morning that we go to Shoryu Ramen in SoHo for dinner tonight. I say this to give you an idea that I have heretofore gone frequently. I said no, and came to write this review. Awful service at this location. Never again, and I am unsure if I will even bother going to the locations in Shoreditch or Liverpool Street Station again.",

After walking around London all day we were getting a little hangry and chose Shoryu Ramen because it was very busy- go where the crowd is, right? Our waitress gave us a rundown of the menu and we placed our orders. My friends went with the most popular ramen bowl and I chose the spicy veggie ramen bowl. The noodles were absolutely delicious & truly hit the spot! The soup was pretty spicy though- and I consider myself able to handle a good amount of heat. My friends liked their bowls as well- commenting that the egg in the soup was really tasty. For about \u00a312 a bowl, the price was right for us- we left full and no longer hangry. Definitely would recommend to people traveling in the area!",

I was here for the soft launch with 50% off on all ramen and the place was constantly full.Seating is much closer than the other Shoryu locations, which means it get really packed, but I didn't see any deterioration in service standards or serving time.The staff were all really upbeat and did a great job managing the constant crowd.Food is standard Shoryu food. Yummy broth, well cooked noodles, great buns. This outlet has a large wine list and a few extras on the food menu. I don't remember poached eggs as an option at the other Shoryu's or maybe I'm mistaken? Yummy food at the Tottenham Court Road station area. At least now I have a healthier option, if I want to grab a late bite when changing buses at this station.",

We shared the Chicken Karaage and then I ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen. I'm not a fried chicken person, but the Chicken Karaage was nicely flavored and not too oily. My ramen was delicious! The broth was nice and rich, and the pork was amazing. It instantly melts in your mouth. I had my noodles cooked medium, which was perfect for me, but you can tell them how soft you want them. I wish they had a version of this ramen with a light kick to it (seems like the spicy things on the menu were really spicy), but it was delicious. Service was pretty friendly, would definitely come again!",

And this one has pretty good friendly service. I just find it awkward when they change their English accents when speaking to me.. I have perfect English btw. It's my first language.",

One of my pet peeves is being ignored after being seated. 15 is too long to wait to get a drink order or appetizer order in but not even a hello or I will be with you in a few minutes. Then we got 2 of of three mains at once. Before we even got our drinks. We were told they could not get the appetizer out faster than the main course. When they brought the drinks it was wrong. They fixed that the brought the Bun we had ordered . We did not get our 3rd entree for an additional 10 minutes after the first 2.1st time I had a party of 3 and the waitress Imke put a 12.5% service charge on our bill. Never saw an automatic tip for group and or bill so small. (Be aware they could be padding their tickets) I paid it but had she done her job right she could have made so much more. We done out a lot and usually tip 20-30% if the service is good.On a positive note they did let us change tables because of an injured leg in our Party. It's too bad the service was horrible because the food was great. The Summer Salmon Ramen was great. As was the signature Ramen dish we ordered. The Special Pumpkin bun was good but there was no pumpkin flavor and I think they may have brought the wrong one. \u00a0I hope they have better trading of their staff in the future.",

Total overkill on the green onions as well as the pickled ginger--no one needs that much pickled ginger. The broth was incredibly watery (probably why there was so much ginger, to make up for it) and the noodles gummy and limp. The sliced pork topping left much to be desired, flavorless and mostly fat. \u00a311 on average for a bowl of ramen isn't worth it, and in Soho, there are much better options like Bone Daddies, which is right down the street. Also had a side of Shishito Padron Peppers, which sound interesting, but for \u00a37, save your cash as these were quite lifeless and dull. You get 10 or so little green peppers with dipping salt, womp womp. When we went, they were out of fried brussels sprouts. The venue was incredibly stuffy, hot, and uncomfortable, and we had to request glasses of water multiple times. Location is a little hectic as it's right on the edge of Shaftesbury so you're going to have to hack through the crowds of tourists just to get to the little nook where the shop sits on Denman. I wanted to return to try the bao tacos, but after this experience, I'll probably save the hassle and calories for a more interesting place like Bao Soho. I'd even take my chances at Ippudo.",

The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was super tasty, although my ramen were overflowing with garlic (hence the name dracula) it didn't mask the beautiful taste of the broth which I found really good!

    "text": "Ever since I saw their huge bowls of ramen and their Hirata buns through the window of the Carnaby branch I have been dying to go here. A friend and I decided to go for dinner before the cinema so chose a restaurant closer to the Piccadilly Vue. On a Friday at 6pm we hadn't booked but were able to walk straight in and get a table (bewarned the whole table must be present, as I was 15 minutes early but they wouldn't seat me until my friend arrived).The staff are friendly and you receive a warm welcome (including a bang of their gong) on the way in as you pass through their iconic Shoryu curtains which adorn the doors of each restaurant. We chose the hottest day of the year for a massive hot bowl of ramen however the restaurant itself was kept cool with air con and luckily the restaurant had plenty of tables so we weren't crammed in even though we were sat on a sharing table.We had received a flyer while walking down the street for free gyoza each (such luck!) when ordering a bowl of ramen so we decided to take it steady on the buns (needed to save room for cinema snacks!) and just ordered one pork belly bun (\u00a34.50) to share. Most of their ramen dishes are based on their tonkotsu pork broth (Each pan takes over 12 hours cooking and is made of collagen, fat, marrow and calcium and combined with 'motodare', a concentrated base of soy and spices to create the final soup) and then laden with thin noodles, which they ask how you would like them cooked (I went for medium). They all contain char siu barbecue pork belly, nitamago egg, kikurage mushrooms, spring onion, sesame, ginger, nori seaweed. The variants from there allow you to get a slightly spicier broth, a broth with lots of garlic, meatier broth and also a choice with seafood or chicken in. I chose the Dracula, which has the addition of caramelised garlic mayo and garlic chips sprinkled on top and my friend went for the Kotteri which had a much meatier broth. Both were really really good - filling, warm and HUGE. Neither of us could finish them. I thought there was plenty of pork (which was so tender) however my friend thought there could have been more for the price. My one niggle was the cold egg however I just didn't eat it :). On the table you also have a pot of sesame (which I didn't spill - honest) and a bulb of garlic along with a crusher so you are able to add additional sesame/garlic to your taste, which I thought was a nice touch. The pork gyoza are served in a VERY hot skillet but to be honest for me were a little bland and chewy. The only real let down was the pork bun which was cold with a chewy, glaggy bun - I have definitely had better from a few different restaurants in Soho. To drink we both stuck to tap water which made the bill with tip a very reasonable \u00a316 each (with free gyoza as well). Although it is \u00a312 per bowl of ramen, I would definitely come again. They are so filling there is no need for any sides so for a delicious tasty dinner out \u00a312 seems reasonable. I will wait to enjoy on my next ramen on a winters evening though.",
