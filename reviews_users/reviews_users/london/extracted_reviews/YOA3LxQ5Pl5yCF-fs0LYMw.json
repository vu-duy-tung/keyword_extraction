    "text": "Boisdale of Belgravia: not just for foodies and down in the dumps ScotPosted on 18 July 2012Wondering where Andy Murray went to drown his sorrows following his defeat by Federer, in the Wimbledon final? I'm not sure of the specifics, but the Scot - whose startling skill made the Swiss maestro sweat last Sunday - could have and should have made a beeline for the Boisdale of Belgravia.Situated on Eccleston Street, an area that seems to go unappreciated by visitors and residents alike, Boisdale acts as an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Victoria station. Put simply this fabulous Scottish themed restaurant run by Ranald Macdonald, that's often referred to as the unofficial Scottish embassy in London, is a pure pleasure drome and thus the perfect place for Murray to forget his misery.There are six places to eat and drink - the clubby Back bar, richly panelled Jacobite room, Auld restaurant, Cigar Terrace (a top spot for smokers to beat the ban in style), charming courtyard garden with its retractable roof for, weather permitting, al fresco dining and, my favourite, the Macdonald Bar which manages to be large yet intimate, buzzy but private.The look is all deep red and dark green walls, mahogany and mounted stags' heads while sweet staff wearing Macdonald Tartan skirts will cluck and fuss over you. Once seated at your table in a tartan upholstered chair, treats - such as warm buttered roles - begin arriving immediately for you to munch on, while perusing the menu. Food is sophisticated but scrumptious. Expect Scotland at its best: think Loch Ryan oysters, Hebridean crab, haggis, Aberdeen angus aged steaks - \u00a0said by Square Meal to be \"incredible\" - \u00a0and smoked salmon.For a bit of stomach lining, I went for a girlie starter of asparagus that came in a truffle butter and hollandaise sauce so delicious I lapped it up like a kitten. Meanwhile my dining companion purred with pleasure over her Hebridean handpicked crab, accompanied by spiced avocado and melba toast (\u00a312.50). As for mains, we can recommend the Dover sole served with buttered new potatoes (\u00a329.50) and the filo pastry parcel of chestnut & oyster mushrooms, fennel and spinach, poached leeks, black truffle sauce (\u00a314.75) - simply exquisite. \u00a0And sides such as broccoli, ginger, chilli and garlic (\u00a35) made me aware that cooking can be an art form. For dessert, do try the caramelised Bramley apple flan with15 year old Glenfiddich caramel sauce \u00a0and vanilla ice cream - addiction on a plate.While the Boisdale was busy when we arrived at 7.30pm, \u00a0it gets more boisterous later on in the evening when the well heeled customers begin to kick back - helped by the outstanding wine and whisky lists and nightly live jazz that starts at 10pm. Indeed the fantastic musicians whip the wealthy locals into a frenzy well into the wee hours, making the Boisdale one of the hottest places to hangout in Belgravia post midnight.Of course, this Scottish jazz, cigar and supper club does cost but believe me when I say the venue is worth every penny and sets standards few others match: we left a lot happier than when we arrived. All told if Andy Murray doesn't get to dine at the All England club's Champion dinner next year, he could do far worse than head to the Boisdale of Belgravia for a taste of the high life - and the Highlands.Need to knowBoisdale of Belgravia13-15 Eccleston Street, SW1W 9LX020 7730 6922Open 12 noon-1am (Mon-Fri); 6pm-1am (Sat)Transport: Victoria tube/rail",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on Friday; it was my first visit to this old school \"Scottish\" themed classic in over 6 years and not much appeared to have changed other than the introduction of the cigar terrace upstairs. After leaving my coat with the charming lady at the entrance I made my way through to the main room and joined the \"legal eagle\" at the lovely zinc bar where we had a cold glass of Morretti before being shown to our table. There was some confusion as we thought we had reserved a table in the more casual bar out back but we were given a great table for two in the main restaurant. After a bit of debate with our helpful waitress it was agreed that we could keep our table and still order from the bar menu (confusing I know but at the Boisdale they have a different bar and restaurant menu and never the twain will normally meet). Continuing our quest for the best burger in town we both went for the \"dangerously hot\" offering; a medium rare Aberdeen Angus rib steak pattie topped with chipotle chilli ketchup, red onion and jalape\u00f1os. It came in a seeded bun with a bowl of thick cut chips on the side. All in all it was pretty tasty, the burger had nice char and a good meaty flavour. The down side was that it could have been a little more moist and it was certainly not \"dangerously hot\" as advertised. However, I would say that most of the boys, and the smaller number of girls, in the Boisdale this Friday lunchtime did not appear to be the types who would be well acquainted with the delights of the chilli so it may well be that the regular punters would have found this pretty hot. Service was quick and we found our waitress attentive without being overbearing. I was deep in conversation with the \"legal eagle\" during our lunch but this can be a good spot for a bit of people watching if you are in the mood to observe the old school approach to afternoon indulgence. The menu here is big on meat and comfort food with a healthy nod to its \"Scottish\" branding i.e you can get a decent haggis, herring and good smoked salmon. It has a very good wine list and a great selection of whiskey but beware the prices are all a bit eye watering!! This is not a place to come if you are looking to bag a bargain or you want something to write home about in the way of your lunch or dinner. However, if you fancy a bit of a blow out, followed by a nice cigar and a dram or two, this is as good a spot as any in town. I will not be rushing back here in a hurry but I do look forward to a return visit in another 5 years or so. The quest continues!!",

    "text": "Update 27-11-2007: To cope with the smoking ban, the Boisdale has now provided a purpose-built Smoking Terrace for Cigar smokers, so cigar aficionados need not go without. It also solves the problem for those who do not want to experience others' smoke while they are eating. *************************** The Boisdale is a restuarant that arouses extraordinary passions: either you'll love it or you'll hate it. The theme is Scottish and masculine: the decor of the multi-roomed interior is dark, with lots of tartan and dark polished wood - rather like a gentlemen's club. The menu is Scottish and masculine too: lots of game, offal, well-hung Aberdeen Angus steaks, Hebridean shellfish, wild salmon and, of course, haggis. The bar menu is extraordinary by any standards: 200 wines, 200 whiskies (nearly 150 single malts), a huge choice of cocktails and over 100 varieties of Cuban cigar. There's a regular Jazz band too, which has become something of a feature here (see the web-site for listings). All this choice comes at a cost: expect dinner with wine to cost around \u00a350 a head. But start on the cocktails, malt whiskies and cigars and, well, the sky's the limit. 12.5% service charge is added, and a charge for the Jazz (\u00a33.95 if you are already there, \u00a310 if you arrive after 10pm). You can spend \u00a3100 per person without really trying, and an awful lot more if you do. (An article on their web-site suggests that bills of \u00a31,000 per person have been known...) Whether or not all this is up your street is up to you. They have, to be fair, begun including vegetarian items on the menu (not the case when I was first taken there) and you could keep costs down by ordering from the fixed-price menus, or even having a sandwich or burger at the bar. But I'm not a fan of drifting clouds of cigar smoke while I eat, nor of Jazz (which I actually like, but in a jazz club, not in a restaurant). Some of my male dining companions thought all this was fabulous, however, and would doubtless award it five stars - and there seemed to be plenty of other punters who agreed with them. The steaks, whiskies and cigars all came in for huge praise. Finally, a word on the service. I've found it extraordinarily variable: from the cloyingly sycophantic, through the decent and professional to the aggressively rude. And, for the record, I have always been taken there with someone else was paying the bill...",

    "text": "Behold the haggis! Scotland's polarizing dish of sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs) minced with onion, oats, suet, spices and salt, mixed with stock and boiled in a sheep's stomach casing. Finding a good one south of the border can prove tricky, but you can't go wrong with the awfully offal version served up in grand Caledonian style at Boisdale of Belgravia. Yes, if you like your savouries with a side of masculine swank \u00a0Boisdale is not to be missed. With its hunter green interiors and plenty of tartan accents, mounted buck heads, a meat-centric menu and a wonderfully extensive whisky list, this bar, restaurant and jazz club (replete with cigar terrace) is a manly sort of place. Expect to see tables full of be-suited older men intent to impress other be-suited older men. Still, a touch of the feminine blends in well: yellow roses at each table, lovely cutlery and dishware ensure that womenfolk can enjoy quality food and exceptionally polite and quick service as well. The menu is as exquisite as it is Scottish: Aberdeenshire steak, Hebridean salmon, Orkney herring, Ayrshire bacon and, of course, haggis. Boisdale's roast Macsween haggis is gorgeous and robust with a not-so-subtle black pepper bite. It's brilliant as a starter. The mini roast Macsween haggis with mashed and bashed neeps (as part of their two courses for \u00a318.90 Jacobite Menu) is certainly a winner as is the house speciality first course offered with caramelised diver-caught South Uist king scallops, saffron mash, dry cured bacon and minted pea puree for \u00a313.50. But, for heartier appetites, the full-sized roast Macsween haggis with neeps from the Jacobite menu is definitely the way to go. A complimentary starter for this hefty treat is the pickled Orkney herring with dill, new potatoes and hot wasabi dressing \u00a0which may just have my vote for the best pickled herring in London. It cleanses the palatte allowing every bite of the haggis to be savoured. The mashed and bashed neeps blend splendidly with the minced bits of the haggis. For those feeling particularly peckish, consider the 2.5cl noggin of Johnnie Walker Black 12 year for an additional \u00a33.25. Dining at Boisdale is a truly scrumptious experience and is the top way to enjoy haggis this side of Hadrian's Wall.",

For second course I ordered Mini Roast Blackfaced Haggis with Mashed and Bashed Neeps. For my main I ordered Glazerts Goat Cheese and Pumpkin Raviolo and dessert the Madagascar Vanilla Cheesecake. The meal was a bit of an experience - atmosphere of the Restsurant and pleasant servers. Soup was nicely done. Haggis was interesting - not sure I would order it again. The pumpkin raviolo was good as was the cheesecake. Overall the meal felt like a somewhat traditional British meal. Exactly what you might want while visiting London.",

We then both ordered the steak and truffle burger, which was also solid. Whilst it wasn't as greasy as the Five Guys, it clearly was higher quality and nicer. We then moved to the cigar terrace, where we shared a cigar and a glass of hot toddy. The gentleman was very helpful with cigar recommendations, and my hot toddy was perfect for the chilly evening as well. Ambience was very posh and almost exclusive. I really enjoyed the paintings on the walk and the dim lights, typical of a jazz venue. Service was overall great. They could be a bit slow at times, depending on the crowd, but they were generally helpful and prompt. I'd definitely go back -- if I had the money, this would be my new go-to place in the neighbourhood.",

Hope the locals don't get mad at Gloria for telling you about this place but sorry gang \u00a0this was a great find thanks to a dear friend that lives here. Oh and can't forget the nice relaxing live music that can range from jazz to blues. It's another great day in the neighborhood and Gloria is off to keep it genuine and may God bless your day and Eve.

It was okay, but obviously the burger needs a bit extra to really stand out.It's right near Victoria Station, so you really have no excuse to not try this place, especially if you're a burger lover.",

This place is very old school London. Lots of toff types and old men in suits sitting down to dinner and swilling whiskey like it's going out of fashion. It really wasn't my cup of tea in terms of mahogany decor and carpets. But I can imagine if you wanted to take some relatives there and whoo them with fancy, it would work. You can also buy cigars here but by English law have to smoke them outside and not in a room. In winter that just seems like a bad idea. We sat in the back room which seems to be reserved for the young people types. I'm pretty sure if I was looking for a rich old husband who was on the brink of death, I'd find him here. Bad points: Service was brutally slow. Even to pay, it felt like I was ageing as I stood there. Good points: the fries with truffle mayo and the enormous ledger full of whiskey!",

They had a \"special\", which was a porterhouse steak that had been aged 30 days, and weighed about 2 lbs. One of the guys in our group decided to try it. At the other end of the table, I had decided on the strip steak, and the guy next to me the filet. The waiter suggested that we order the porterhouse and split it.....I take the strip side, he take the filet side. Made sense, so we said sure. Guess how much that \"special\" steak was? 100 sterling pounds. Converted, that was about $151 USD. Shame on us for not asking, but OMG. The steak itself was pretty good, but I've had better in good 'ole Richmond VA for 1/5 the price. They like to slice the steak in strips, still connected to the bone, which in my opinion dried it out. The sides were good, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was good. Service was slow, but we did have a large party. All-in-all, I would try somewhere else.",

    "text": "London, England Alright - time to set the record straight.During my recent visist to London, I was invited to this location for dinner by a friend who is a member.Cozy yes, (first floor), live jazz yes (first floor), good food Absolutely! \u00a0First off, met my pal at the cigar terrace - had a drink and went downstairs for dinner. \u00a0Keep in mind this was in early May 2013. \u00a0I opended up with a special for the evening - \u00a0Pigeon Salad, it was Amazing - PERIOD.Entree - I HAD to go with the Haggis - \u00a0Full disclosure, I have never had the opportunity let alone tried Haggis prior to Boisdale's. \u00a0Simply put I am not a Haggis expert - \u00a0buit thier Haggis dish is something I can eat at least once a week until I am no longer on this planet.Service - the folks treat you like Royalty - smiles and amazing service all the way around.If... If I lived in London, I would eat here 2 to 4 times a month.",
