But yes, the interior was cute and small. After we were seated, we ordered our food. I orded the Dol Sot Bibimbop. AMAZING. the egg was actually visible! ahha the rice was really good as well as the vegetables that came along in the stone pot. The seafood bibimbop was also amazing. Their miso soup however does taste like any other miso soup. Their green tea however is a MUST TRY! Comes in a little teapot per order :)",

In 5 minutes they had freed a table for us, it's very causal, kind of fast food style.We took some shared appetizers, you can actually avoid them, not bad but really, nothing interesting.The main dish is of course the bibimap (say it again, bibimap. Lovely word, isn't it!? BI BI MAP!), a bowl of rice, vegetables and meat with a fried egg on top, coming in hot stone bowl (I repeat, HOT stone bowl. Don't try to steal your neighbor's one, I'm still paying the consequences!). Now, it's good. I mean, it's the kind of dish you have and you thing \"well ok, that was solid good dish\", but nothing to scream on the road about it waving a pair of chopsticks, it is just good. stop.And Cheap. Which is good, I would rather pay one pound more and have a bit more rice in my bowl, but that's it.I'd suggest it for tourists or for lunch, but otherwise.. well try it once, I don't think you'll feel like coming back in a short period.",

I came here with Isabel and Jane to get a bite, and I had the spicy pork Bibimbap. I also ordered the Kimchi and some dumplings to start because I was hungry. The kimchi was really nice (but not amazing). The dumpling were probably the best thing I ate there. Really hot, soft and delicious. The bibimbap itself is always a lot of fun (especially if you for the raw egg, which I recommend) as then you stir in the raw egg with your food to cook it in the bowl. Always a good time. And it was nice, not amazing, but good. I did add quite a bit of the miso and the spicy sauce to mine as well to give it a bit more flavor.So yeah, I'd come back if I need something quick and cheap. Although I think if I'm looking for something specifically Korean, I'd probably try another place.",

And maybe it was the fact that it was summer time the next time I ate here but I just didn't like it as much as the first time. I had the spicy pork the first time and bulgogi beef the second, two toppings that I really enjoy outside of bibimbap. Maybe I just have a major preference for spicy pork, but the bulgogi was just okay! I wasn't a big fan of the dumplings either - they tasted okay but I think the dumplings at Seoul Bakery were just as good, and cheaper!The service was fine; you did kinda need to flag them down if you wanted more water or the bill but I feel like that's kind of standard for a lot of restaurants in London.I definitely should go back in the winter time to see if I think any differently about it again, because maybe it was just that a sizzling hot stone bowl in the summer is just not as appetising!",

Don't worry though, as other reviewers mentioned, they turn tables quickly here. You won't have to wait long.The interior of the restaurant isn't going to win any awards, but that doesn't matter much when you're immersed in a piping hot bowl of bibimbap.Expect to spend \u00a38-\u00a312 per main and maybe another \u00a33-\u00a35 for a drink. The star of the menu is, not surprisingly, the bibimbap, but go ahead and treat yourself to some starters too. They're pretty delicious. The bibimbap here comes in the standard nuclear hot stone bowl and is filled with white rice, your choice of vegetables, meat, and that lovely runny egg. It's not the best I've had in the world (my mom's Korean ya'll), but it's a great value for Central London at around \u00a310. The food comes out quickly and the service is, well let's just call it 'attentive'. You get about 5 minutes to look at the menu and decide, and 2-2.5 hours at your table in total. After that, you will kindly be asked to leave, so don't expect to linger here all night.",

    "text": "Dang, that was disappointing. Fairly decent food in a charmingly quirky space, completely ruined by weird customer service.I can give Bi Bim Bap a little benefit of the doubt over the fact that I arrived really late to our small dinner party (was having too much fun at the Yelp Audio Lounge event--stunning sound and free gin, go figure) of five, and it was confusing to have one person order while everyone else was finishing up. What happened next, though, was even more stunning than the Audio Lounge stereos:Server: Are you finished?Friend: *with hands on bowl* I'd quite like to hold on to it, it's so warm!Server: *makes gesture to clear stone bowl*Friend: Oh, but may I keep it a little longer, please? It's just so nice to hold!Server: No. *takes stone bowl*Me: *jaw drops*Okay, so maybe there's a second benefit of the doubt in the fact that my friend has an abnormal fondness for cuddling heated crockery, but she was being charming and smiley about it, and the server was being humorless and rude. The restaurant wasn't even very busy at this time, so the theory that they needed the bowl to serve more bibimbap was out.Or so we thought. Some ten or so minutes later, four steaming bibimbaps appeared for my friends. Who had already eaten their bibimbaps (and had their stone bowls snatched back by force). After a brief moment of confusion, the bowls and servers stole away as quickly as they appeared, with someone muttering at us \"we didn't cross the order off\" by way of reluctant explanation. Mistakes are understandable, but somehow the interaction left us feeling really guilty that four perfectly good bibimbaps were being sent back to the kitchen because of us.Oh yes, and there was also this gem of an interaction:Friend: May we see the dessert menu?Server: No.We then figured out that they don't serve dessert, but what a response! To add insult to injury, there was no toilet paper in the ladies room (or the men's--I checked). There was an apologetic staffer who came back with a roll--but only after I asked for it.And the dol sot bibimbap was fine--but definitely not as memorable as the customer service.",

Make sure you put lots of the red sauce in...soo delicious. My friend had the spicy chicken ramen, not sure if it's the real name, but it tasted legit like it came from a instant noodle pack..so stick with the bi bim baps! BUT it was very good ramen lolThe price is amazing if you compare it to other places, to me anyways because I would think bi bim bap would be more expensive but it's pretty much american pricing which is great! This place is way too cute..I came here tonight at 630pm and within 30 mins the top floor was filled up..the bottom floor wasn't open but that's where the bathrooms/loos are located and they even have posters of 2NE1 and Girl's Generation.

Once there, I fell in love with the food, especially my love of Kimchis. Bi Bim Bap reproduce the food exactly as I remembered it from Seoul and the prices are very reasonable (especially if you purchase their meal deals).The bad thing about them is to do with the limited amount of dining space available. On a busy day, the place can get full very quickly and the tables are on the small side, so even if you manage to get a table, it is difficult to place all plates on them (especially with large orders). Overall, I love this place and recommend it.",

    "text": "Bi Bim Bap is a cute little place in Soho that serves fresh Korean food in a jiffy. \u00a0After a morning of wandering around Mayfair, my boyfriend and I came in here for lunch after reading a review in the Guardian. \u00a0We were seated quickly even at midday lunch - the crowd was mostly tourists - and though the room was pretty full, downstairs where the toilets are they have another dining area so you shouldn't ever be waiting long.I got the mixed seafood bibimbap. \u00a0Bibimbap, for those who don't know, means \"mixed rice\" and is served in a hot (very!!) stone bowl. \u00a0You'll get rice (extra charge for brown), mixed veggies, and marinated meat. \u00a0On the table are hot sauce and miso sauce. \u00a0Often a raw egg is placed on top and gets cooked as your stir the bowl around. \u00a0This is one of the only foods I know of where your dish actually gets hotter as you eat! \u00a0It starts out warm but the bowl heats it throughout, so by your last bite you'll be in danger of scalding your tongue! \u00a0Great on a cold day.The portions here are small, and I think the flavors need to be upped a fair bit. \u00a0The meat has allegedly been marinated but tastes plain, and without tons of added sauce from the table, there's really not much flavor. \u00a0And the rice didn't stick to the bowl (maybe not enough sesame oil?) - eating the crisp rice at the end is supposed to be one of the best parts!It's serviceable and pretty healthy, but I would've liked to see a bit more flavor and a slightly bigger portion! \u00a0(I'm Amurrrrican, sorry.)",

It isn't the most traditional Korean restaurant in London, but your food is ready in 10 minutes and it's reasonably priced. Healthy, fresh and fast.Gamsahabnida, Bi Bim Bap!",

The whole thing was tasty. The Shitake Mushroom was plentiful, the pork was not too much where it overpowered. So tasty that I didn't need to add miso or chili sauce. \u00a0Oulong tea was proper. \u00a0Only issue is the space is tight and they are understaffed. Oh one more thing that is absolutely charming.

We did order kimchee for an extra quid and a half, and the bibimbap is cheap enough so that the whole meal is still relatively inexpensive, but I probably would not come back. It is conveniently located in Soho, so it could be a good choice for a quick bite before a show or after shopping, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. TIPS:- The line can be long, but it doesn't take long to be seated. - Arrive before 7:30 pm to avoid a crazy line.- Share a bibimbap bowl and try appetizers to get more flavor.",

We were in a neighborhood and up for a warm, not too expensive Korean meal. This place ticked all of the boxes. You have some starters to choose from, big range of bibimbap and drinks card. We ordered two different meat dishes - spicy pork and bulgogi with some kimchi on the side. To drink - ice green tea - and beware it is not sweetened.Spicy pork was delicious, flavorsome, however bulgogi lacked a bit in taste and spices used. Adding a bit of chili sauce helped. Kimchi was ok, not great..I had better - they could also serve a bit bigger portion. All in all it was a very tasty dinner and great option for a quick meal..not a romantic place, however good for a nice meal.",

I take friends from out of town (to impress them with my insider knowledge), I take myself on solo lunch dates, I take Londoners for buzzy Friday night dinners (to impress them with my non-insider insider knowledge).It's not an obvious favourite - the service is a little brusque (you'll almost always be given your bill before asking), the ambience is somewhat canteen-esque and the food is churned out suspiciously quickly - but god it tastes good. And it's definitely bright and cheery, K Pop tween stars and love heart shaped Polaroid arrangements line the walls - very cutesy.All in all, you don't come here for marathon dinners over a bottle of red - you come here for good, quick, honest food. Although it should be noted that while Bibimbap doesn't have the cool factor of some of its Soho neighbours, it certainly does have the queues",

    "text": "I am not a Korean food expert. I have only had Bibimbap once before in my hometown that is notoriously nicknamed Johns Korea, so I trust the food I had there to be relatively authentic but most importantly, delicious. Apart from the \"authenticity snobbery\" the food here was equally as delicious. Several coursemates and I had stumbled in here after classes on Friday and our ritual trip to the pub. Already well... erm... socially lubricated we were ravenous and hoping to get some decent food. After stumbling around in the cold in search of this place we came across a small sliver of a restaurant; easily missed if you're not being too careful. The restaurant is small so trying to seat the 8 of us proved to be difficult. We had to wait but it wasn't very long before we were all snug in a booth in the back drinking soju (Korean Rice Liquor) and eating kimchi dumplings.I ordered the bulgolgi bibimbap which may be a bastardization of the actual traditional food but hell... it was damn good. Bulgogi is beef marinated in Korean barbecue sauce and is essentially the food stuffs of gods. I have a serious and unhealthy love affair with Korean barbecue but it's quiet expensive even back in America. Fortunately, I will take bulgolgi in a bibimbap. I got the raw egg on the Bibimbap and let it cook on the hot stones and really amid the dulling soju and real ale the food was incredibly flavorful. The meat was tender and well marinaded with a sweet, yet savory sauce. The bowl came with pickled radishes and bean sprouts that worked beautifully with the sweet and savory flavors of the meat and egg. The best part about this place was the price. \u00a312 will get you a decent meal and in Soho... that's a bargain. It's a casual place and easily missed or forgotten about. If you're looking for a decent and different bite in the Soho area, check out Bibimbap.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times in London as this is probably the best Korean restaurant in London. Korean food is generally pricey but Bibimbap Soho has great inexpensive prices and amazing food which is the big reason why I keep coming back.Service: Is definitely okay, sometimes the waiters are a bit inattentive but most of the times they are on pointe.Food: The appetizers like the spicy rice cakes, kimchee, seafood pancake comes in very small portions but okay for sharing if you are only two. I tried the spicy chicken bibimbap and the beef bulgogi bibimbap, and they both are amazing!! They come with miso and hot sauce so you can mix the flavors how you want.Best Korean food in London!!",

I was on a 'London Day Out' and was craving some substantial carb + veggie so bi bam bap sounded terrific!D\u00e9cor: Small to comfortable sized for what it is, welcoming, with polaroids of customers eating their food on the wall. I felt comfortable even though I was eating by myself!Service: Nice, simple and quick- no complaints!Food: I got the beef bi bim bap and to my surprise it came SIZZLING. Yes, SIZZLING. The table next to me did not have their food yet and looked over several times at my dish as I mixed everything up because it smelled good, sounded good and looked good (3 out of 5 senses satisfied without even having touched it!). And when I mixed it all together with the red sauce and ate it, oh I was so happy. Nice and hot like it's supposed to be. Good balance of vegetables, beef, rice and sauce (of course, it's your personal preference of how much you want in it). I also got the Jap Chae to go. It was a tad on the oily side, but it is just like the ones I get back home in California. And for 4.95, really.. you can't beat it.Bottom Line: If you want Bi Bim Bap in London and you're in this area, I HIGHLY recommend this. The dish is less than 7 pounds and you can do take away and eat it in the nearby Soho Square if you'd like. Yes, please!",

    "text": "Now I must admit that my exposure to Korean food is entirely limited to this restaurant and my actual real-life Korean friend who occasionally whips me up a multicultural storm in her Brixton kitchen. \u00a0One time, having stayed over after a particularly heavy night out, I even managed to catch her parents popping over mid-morning and, due to my enviable ability to loiter, snagged myself an invitation for lunch. \u00a0My, but those noodles were good; and her mum's home-made kimchi cleared up my hangover like a gift from the gods.But beyond that, all I know is Soho's wonderful Bi Bim Bap. \u00a0I should probably try another restaurant but I never really got around to it. \u00a0And I don't honestly see the point because I loooove Bi Bim Bap. \u00a0Looooove it. \u00a0It's worth the extra Os. \u00a0It's my go-to cheapy dinner spot in Soho, and I've dragged many a friend here to show off my international taste in good food. \u00a0It's especially ideal to lure in your pickier dining companions since the brightly-coloured decor and mini-polaroids covering the wall lend it a slightly fast-food-esque, less terrifying aura. \u00a0By the time they realise what's on offer, it's too late.Although to be fair, the food isn't live octopi or skewered snakes or whatever else Korean food has a reputation for being. \u00a0It's kind of like Thai, but you know, not really. \u00a0And it's all cooked really, um, nicely. \u00a0I don't like summing up a nation's cuisine in a few sentences because not only will I inevitably get it wrong, I'll probably insult an entire culture at the same time.I have the eponymous bi bim bap every time. \u00a0It's rice, vegetables and thinly-sliced beef in a sizzlingly hot stone bowl, which you mix around so that it cooks merely by touching the sides. \u00a0I slosh in a healthy dollop of miso sauce from the alarmingly green bottle on every table (if you're averse to heat, avoid the red one; it's not ketchup, it's mega chilli) which gives it the perfect saltiness and depth. \u00a0Much like I ought to try another restaurant, I ought to attempt another dish too, but I probably won't. \u00a0I'm all for variety but I don't really see the point of branching out here when it's Just So Good. \u00a0I have at least tried the different meats on offer (all gorgeous) and both with and without the egg (also both gorgeous) so I see no reason why the rest of it wouldn't be equally excellent. \u00a0So if you want to be the guineapig, go ahead. \u00a0But I figure if it ain't broke, don't fix it.(An aside: service is enormously hit and miss. \u00a0Friendly faces, HUGELY slow. \u00a0Last time I went, the couple next to us got their meals before we'd even had our orders taken, and we arrived first. \u00a0My companion was a lot more hacked off than me, but then I've lived in Asia so I kind of slip back into that mode and just go with the flow. \u00a0Besides, it's worth the wait).",

The spicy rice cakes were delicious and the only dish I enjoyed. \u00a0For entree, I ordered the plain chicken bool-go-gi rice, and thought I could use the kim chi side dish to give it some kick, but the dish turned out to be just average. \u00a0The chicken was very dry. \u00a0And sadly, they do not provide any side dishes at this establishment...I tried to scrape the sauce from the spicy rice cakes from my rice dish, but it didn't provide enough flavor :-(",

Stir it up as soon as possible and keep it moving but allow for some of it to get crusty on the bottom.It's not a huge place but they have both upstairs and downstairs and should be able to accommodate a party of about 8 or so. I'm a Bulgogi fan so that's what I normally go for, but their spicy pork is also good, not tried any of the others so I'll leave that for other people to review.Sadly, I think their sides let them down a little, the seafood pancake seemed expensive for what we got, really light on the seafood compared to other places, and the glass noodles Jap Chae were also more expensive and not as good as elsewhere. Make no mistake, they are good, but I'll get them elsewhere unless somebody else is ordering them.When (that's a when, not an if) I go again, I'll stick to the bibimbaps, but for a relatively quick eat in Soho, I can't really complain.

Though I'm not a huge fan of the music, it works for the space and the service.I ordered the rice cake starter and a bibimbap with tofu strips for lunch. For some reason, this time everything just tasted too sweet. Some bits of rice cake weren't cooked well enough, and the sauce, rather than leaving you with a nice rounded taste in your mouth, was just sticky and sweet. The bibimbap itself had generous toppings, but it basically was all toppings and the flavour of the tofu was overpowering. Maybe I'll order the dish without the tofu strips next time, but it'd be nice to have a little bit more rice to add some more substance to the dish!Good for a quick craving, but I'm still looking for a good bibimbap unfortunately...",

The stone bowl was burning hot as it should be, keeping the dish toasty until the last bite.My issues included the general stickiness of all the restaurant surfaces- table, floor and bathroom handles! Also staff was a bit aloof and seemed all too eager to clear our plates and hustle us out the door.I've had better bibimbap to be honest but for \u00a37 this was a good option for lunch today!",

The sauces on the table (chilli and miso) are a great addition, as is the raw egg which joins everything together as it cooks. This is one of the most delicious dishes you can get for under \u00a37 in London. Get some kimchi on the side and a bottle of Korean beer, you won't be disappointed. Then keep going back! Yum!",

Ain't nobody got time for that), we decided to try out Bibimbap Soho, and it was a good choice!Neither of us had ever had bibimbap but we both understood the concept. We were pleased the see the restaurant was full (an empty restaurant is generally a bad sign!) and we only had to wait a few minutes for a table.I quickly decided on the Beef Bulgogi Bibimbap, and the person with me had the spicy pork. Both were delicious, but I preferred mine. The beef was a touch dry but as I am completely in love with the squirty bottle of miso sauce, there was no trouble. The beef was lovely and lean and sliced thinly. I didn't get an egg but I will next time - a raw egg would really have brought the whole thing together.The bowl kept everything roasting throughout the meal, and even when I'd finished (and I'm not a fast eater) the bowl was too hot to hold. We didn't get any sides but still neither of us were able to finish our meals. So to leave a restaurant full, but not overstuffed and heavy but instead slightly virtuous (I left rice, not veg!) for under \u00a310 a head in Soho is pretty damn good.I'm sure I'll be here all winter!",

I chose the chilli chicken which was tasty and filling, and all the fresh veggies made me feel good. A dash of the chilli sauce on the table went with it nicely - note this isn't ketchup despite the look of the bottle. Also remember not to grab the sizzling hotter-than-the-sun stone bowl with your bare hand in your excitement to get to the bottom (doh)... I was extra glad about my cold bottle of Hite at that point!Service is brusque as you might expect but this place had everything I needed to pick-me-up on a cold, rainy London eve.

The menu has a large choice of reasonably priced korean dishes, I chose a Dol Sot \u00a0and my friend had a \u00a0 (Kim Chi Bibimbap), these were served after a very short wait, which was good since we were hungry, they were served in these Wonderful hot traditional dishes, and tasted well... like if paradise had a taste well that's what it would taste like. So if you want a real rauthentic korean meal, this reasonably priced place is totally the place to go. I strongly recommend it !",

    "text": "Note if there was an option to give 3.5 stars that would be a more accurate reflection of my review. Bimbimbap \"does what it says on the tin\" - it offers bimbimbap that is satisfying, tasty and hot. The pickles are fresh and nicely sour and the starters such as the tofu, kimchi pancake and mixed vegetables are also noticeably fresh and well seasoned. However the shortfalls are the meat is average with not much flavour, the menu is quite limited and the bimbimbap is so hot it leaves you vigorously stirring and blowing on the food to prevent the rice or your mouth getting burnt. The setting, music and service is pleasant so this restaurant is good as an occasional healthy dine out but perhaps not for special occasions and is not for everybody.",

    "text": "Reading the reviews I thought this place is really good and delicious, well I was mislead. Bibimbap is among my top 10 dishes worldwide. Having the original ones in Korea is an experience but you would think this is a simple dish and no one should have a problem making it especially when one knows the techniques and flavors. OK some pluses, the location is easy to find, close to the underground, the service is good, prices are also not high so its an affordable dish plus the menu is promising.I had Beef Bool-Go-Gi wth a side of kimchi. The kimchi was OK whereas the beef was super dry, not sweet at all and quiet tough big chunks. Well I know my bulgogi well, and if proper cuts of beef were used and marinated properly this would be a good dish but this was a letdown! Hence my rating, I definitely had better bulgogi even in London and not even compering to the ones in Korea.Given the good reviews and some options I would like to try I will try to visit this place once more and maybe update my rating but for now IF U EVER HAD TE REAL DEAL or like your beef juicy and tender then avoid Beef Bool-Go-Gi Bibimbap!!!",

Since it's a small restaurant with a lot of tables squeezed into a tiny space and everyone is eating from extremely hot stone bowls, it gets a little bit warm. In the winter this could be an incentive to come and have a hearty meal but on a really hot day, I don't think I'd brave the heat.The food is great, service friendly and fast. The waiter was very attentive and came to refill our teapot before we'd even realised we had emptied it. The sauce (miso and goju) is self serve and although I was generous, I found that the goju sauce didn't have the kick I was expecting. Something to keep in mind if you are into spicy food.There is the choice of white or brown rice, egg or no egg and raw or fried. The menu here is small but I have admit that I didn't even go over most of it as I had decided on a vegetarian bi bim bap before I even sat down.Great place for an inexpensive dinner in an area of town not particularly renowned for its wallet friendly reputation.",

I've recent discovered my obsession with beef bulgogi bowls and so when I coworker recommended this place for dinner I almost jumped with joy. And this place did not disappoint. I was served a massively meaty bowl complete with all the veggies (sans mushrooms) and a beautiful fried egg on top. \u00a0I devoured the whole thing as I knew I would. My only complaint was the service. They struggled to get our orders correct and we had to scoop food off one bowl and put it on another to make it work. If a group of 6 threw them off I can't image how frazzled they might get with larger groups. But once we began digging in we hardly cared about the mix up. They also have a light Korean beer that pairs nicely with the richness of the bowls. I highly recommend this place if you are in the Soho area!",

As far as the fried chicken goes I was expecting for the sauce to come already on the chicken, but it didn't it came as a side that you could dip the chicken in so this was a bit of a disappointment.

The portions were perfect as I find many places serve way too much and I always end up wasting it, but here was just right. The menu had some very interesting choices with a lot of variety from the usual veggie, chicken and seafood ones to ginkoa nutrition bowls and even raw beef! I loved the choice of brown rice and raw egg available, and there was plenty of choice for sides. The location is about a few mins walk from Tottenham station right in Soho. The downside is that it's small and very popular so parties of 2 or more may have to queue a bit. But there's plenty of bar seats for single customers, so I didn't feel guilty of taking up a table. The service was fairly efficient and the prices were reasonable around \u00a38-11. Overall, excellent bibimbap with great variety and good prices.",

Ordered '' Spicy bacon '' They serve it in a heated bowl, and that's precisely why i do Not recommend going there. From the tase and quality of food this is what I think they do, \u00a0they just heat up the bowl and add veggies and meat that are couple of days old at least, which seat somewhere (frozen perhaps or worse) I have to say I feel shitty afterwards.. Tgats how they manage to serve it so fast, and that their whole business model.",

Food was good, not super spicy but then I tolerate a lot of heat so take that with a grain of salt. Very much like the idea of Bibimbap, somewhat healthy option. Always take the egg! Once I didn't and it was a bitter disappointment. Also do try the sauces that come. They might look like ketchup and mustard but they're not! The place itself is cramped a little but still somewhat comfortable. I was seated at a 2 person table at the end of ground floor and was surprised at how far I was from my partner. Not a big deal. Liked the chairs and really liked how the place looked, the graphic design. My companion cared less for it. Look at photos posted, very honest. And be careful of the bowl! Very hot!",

If you need to quickly fill of your tummy before heading to one of the neighbouring clubs/pubs/bars, this is definitely a place you should pop in to.The Bibimbap comes along with Gochujang and Doenjang sauces with the former being made from red chili peppers and the later being white bean. You can make your Bibimbap spicier by adding Gochujang. The Korean Hite beer is also worth trying.

Plum wine is way too expensive (18 \u00a3) , 3 starters - jab chae, tofu and sea food pancake - were in small tiny dishes, not interesting flavor in bibimbaps-nutritious, salmon and beef. No side dishes at all like kimchi and charged for a fried egg. It was a busy day but Service was not fast or nice.Oh my!",

My partner had a Beef Bi Bim Bap with Dumplings which she also found to be excellent.The only issue I would have with the place was the drinks menu, which was a little limited and the atmosphere was slightly quiet, although this could be due to the fact that it was a Wednesday night.Overall a very enjoyable experience and I definitely intend to go back.",

The Polaroids and Kpop add to the atmosphere, and the service was excellent they gave us regular updates while in the queue on how long it would be (wasn't that long and totally worth the wait) and were lovely when we gave very confusing orders. I had a classic beef bool go gi, I must admit this was partly because I liked the name and wanted to say it out loud. I upgraded to having brown rice and a fried egg on top which led to the complicated ordering as we all changed our order after making them to include a few extras - out waitress was lovely about it though and we all still got exactly what we ordered and she had remembered who had ordered what. The food was delicious!! It explains on the menu that the trick is to mix everything up really well and who doesn't love being encouraged to play with their food? This leads to amazing flavour combinations, and each bite being unique. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and it is great to be able to cook anything more on the bowl, if you want to, and it is a bonus that you can eat slowly and still have the food piping hot all the way to the bottom of the bowl. The bill was another pleasant surprise, really good value.I will definitively be back- and if anyone knows how you get a Polaroid on the wall please let me know!",

If you are getting Bibimbap, the beef bulgogi is good along with a fried egg. Not sure why but quite a few people eating in here don't mix the bowl of food together. It's worth a good mix, both to experience the traditional way of eating the hot rice bowl, and to make sure your rice doesn't end up stuck to the bottom of your hot stone. May be worth avoid the soups as they tend to pretty salty.",

Basically what came out was a stone bowl filled with rice and topped with a heap of delicious ingredients including some succulent marinated beef strips. Mix it all together and start eating, unbelievable. \u00a0I saw some people with an egg on top of their order but I wasn't brave enough, maybe next time.

I opted for the classic, which the restaurant's logo is based on. It was certainly pretty, but didn't taste of much. I added quite a lot of the available sauce, and even then the dish felt a little bland. I doubt I'll be returning.",

It's a regular haunt of mine so, I usually take Korean food virgins here, it's a nice way to ease them in, without smelling like a KBBQ house when you walk out the door. ALTHOUGH, that smell is sometimes very delicious. LOLThey offer so many choices. my two favourites are definitely the mixed mushroom with brown rice or the yukwhe dolsot bibimbap. I prefer the former because when they bring it out with the raw egg, raw meat in the bowl. Some people get well freaked out, and it's funny. Well I think it's funny. It's a cute place, it's got polaroids of customers along the walls, and it's playing korean pop in the background. so, the bibimbap's are not the best in the world, for me, but the choice makes up for it.",

On the healthier and cheaper side of eating out in the city, the beef bool-go-gi is a incredible mass of meat over veggies and rice (option of brown rice) that cooks in a hot stone bowl as you eat it! It can come with a fried egg on top as well if you like. \u00a0I can still hear the sizzling deliciousness in my food coma dreams. They serve this all with two sauces: a red chili and a miso. The miso was to die for and I made sure to savor and close my eyes with every bite that touched my tongue.I love Kim Chi so I also decided to try out the pancakes as a previous reviewer had recommended and I was not disappointed with the flavor or taste. However, it was a bit on the richer side food-wise for me so next time I think I would just order the plain Kim Chi. (But really there is more than enough food already in the main course without needing to order any additions.) This place is so tasty that I have now converted my usually very finicky eating boyfriend to the delicious ways of Korean food and I think he very well may become a regular here. I also can not say enough about how lovely and accommodating the people who worked there were. They made sure to open and close the door for us as we came and went and checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Obviously I have nothing bad to say about this establishment so get your butt off the sofa and into Soho and give it a try.",

It smelled delicious from the outside and decided we would return later in the week to try it. We did and what a pleasant surprise! You order your dinner which is placed in incredibly hot stone bowls (the tables bear the marks of the heat which goes through the wooden place settings it is placed on). You are then given two different sauces to add if you want (one is like a Miso and the other like a Sriracha). Spicy even without the add ins, the food is beyond delicious. As you eat the bowls remain hot so you can stir the food up and the cooler food goes to the bottom and side where it warms up again and the warmer food comes to the top. The food never gets cold, Great concept. You can opt out of the egg on top or mix it in. We saw two customers piling on the sauces, and I as a lover of spice, choked just looking at the amount - they had to have lead lined stomachs. talking to our daughter, she was very familiar with this Korean bowl style and has eaten it before and knew the whole process. Why didn't you ever mention it before? So impressed. we are now in the process of looking for similar stone bowls so we can try to recreate a similar dish at home.",

Then, this is the place to go!Most all dishes are less than 10 GBP, which I suppose is pretty cheap and reasonable here in London.**The rice is not crispy, like someone else noted. However, this is not a typical old-fashioned Korean restaurant. It's a more modern-day, \"express\" (if you will), Korean Bi-bim-bap (BBB) restaurant. So, the pot is hot, but the rice is not crispy. So, what does this place do differently? Well, most everything is similar to other places. However, they have TWO sauces: \"chili\" sauce and \"miso\" sauce. The \"chili\" sauce is really a red pepper paste-based sauce, really not very spicy. The miso sauce is like ... miso sauce (or to me, it tasted like doen-jang, which is a korean soy bean paste -- regardless, very similar to miso). I enjoyed the miso and was pleasantly surprised. I used BOTH of them (extra miso, please)! I ordered the FILET BEEF BBB. The filet meat is served raw!!! The server mentioned that this was his favorite. When I got the plate, he was not joking! I looked at the raw strips of meat, and I second guessed whether I should have ordered something that was already cooked. However, he was right. The meat DID in fact cook while I was mixing it. So, that was reassurring.***the ONE thing I wish would have happened differently: I wish they would've told me that they charge extra for a fried egg on top of the BBB. The \"extras\" may have noted it, but I wasn't looking for it. Anyway, other than that, I was pleased.SEATING: One very long bar that seats about 10 (individuals, this is probably where you'll sit, but the gazillion pictures makes it quite exciting!). There were a handful of tables up front that seat 2 and 4, a couple in the back, a booth, and there may have been some seating downstairs -- not sure about the downstairs!",

I have been a lover of Korean food since 2001, when my college roomie first introduced me to it. We spent many a late night eating rice or kimchi instead of the standard college pizza delivery. So, I'm always down for some Bi Bim Bap! When I invited my uncle to meet me there for dinner, he jokingly asked me if I was the Skat Man and I was singing a song. Luckily for him, he was about to get educated in the ways of fast and delicious Korean delights. We were seated immediately at a booth. For appetizers, we started with the spicy rice cakes and the seafood pancakes. (My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it...) I ordered the Beef Bool-Go-Gi Bi Bim Bap. In the U.S., I normally get the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap (served in a hot stone bowl) and that normally comes with beef. But, here, I had to get the beef added on. The quality of the meat was great. It wasn't too thinly sliced and was very well seasoned. Overall, the food was delicious and well priced. Go there, if you are in Bloomsbury and in need of some noms that will leave you with some coinage. With your left over cash money, you can head over to Covenant garden and get some souvenirs.

You can order a fried egg for a pound more to add even more flavor, and you stir and swirl it all for just...amazing heaven.I love the fact that the waitress provided me with two sauces: gochujang (spicy) and soy bean (non-spicy). I believe she told me the soy bean was miso-based.

But it doesn't stop me from returning. I bring new people every time I go and they all fall in love with the food as well. It's great for families, friends, omnivores or vegans; everyone! Try the Korean beer Hite (Save yourself some embarrassment, friends; it's pronounced like \"height\", not hee-tay) or the loose teas are lovely on a cool day.For the starters the dumplings are nice, but nothing fancy. I would go for the steamed tofu or kim chi. Mains are always difficult. I steer newcomers away from the comfort of noodles to their signature dishes of bibimbap. It's their name sake for Pete's sake! What are they thinking!? Now, do I want spicy kimchi? The textural wonderland of the \"Nutritious\" bowl and those lovelt ginko nuts? Mushrooms? Mounds and mounds of mushrooms!? Chewy fried tofu? I'm seriously drooling here. Top it off with some mild chilli sauce and miso sauce, awww, Heaven! Now get your metal spoons ready to stir!!Now, they do not give you a traditional raw egg on top (food laws I think), but you may be able to ask for it if they think you know what you are doing.(After a full belly, we usually pop across the street to Lick for a cheeky sample of gelato.)They used to take your group's photo to put on the wall, does anyone know if they still do?

However I can imagine how busy it would be on a Friday or Sat night. Their Jap Chae was amazing. It was literally the best one we've had and we have all been to several Korean restaurants. Too bad the portion is small, yes I know it is only a starter! We also tried 4 other starters and all ordered the same bibimbap (yummy). What you're paying is pretty good for quality & quantity.I'd highly recommend anyone to go if they have a craving for Korean without forking out a fortune! :)",

    "text": "First time trying bibimbap, and I really enjoyed it! I had the dol sot bibimbap, which is their classic. It comes with cucumber, daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, carrots, mooli, and a fried egg on top. It was tasty, healthy (I got brown rice for a slight extra charge), and cheap. My kind of food! I noticed some complaints in other reviews about small portion size, but I didn't find this was the case. I have a big appetite, and my bowl filled me up just fine.",

    "text": "Two stars lost here but not because the food is mediocre, because some of the rules regarding service defy logic and the staff seem a little manic and insane. Since all the Korean places by Centre Point got ripped down and fucked by central London redevelopment, this probably is the best place to have Koreas best dish that they serve in a sizzling stone pot. I came here in a group of 4 last Friday and tried to get a table. One of our party was outside having an important phone call with his grandad, so we went in to secure a table. The woman on the door told us this wouldn't be possible, despite the restaurant being largely empty. We asked if we could get a drink in the meantime, in which were told yes but would have to stand by the doorway to drink it. Very bizarre, seeing as there was a completely empty sideboard running down the restaurant with approximately 12 empty seats. Maybe we should have said that we would be willing to move should a party of 12 eye contact fearing people, who insist on sitting in a row next to each other arrive during the 5 minutes we had to wait for our friend to finish his phone call, but we were too baffled by the logic at play to ask questions. We went back outside and seriously debated wether to fuck it off and go to Wetherspoons, but in the end we went back fully grouped. Other than the demented work of the staff, I have little else to say except the food was quite good. The Kimchi pancake was light and sponge-like and the egg and beef in my bibimbap was raw like I asked for, served in a sizzling bowl as you would expect. I'm making it sound more functional that it was, but really the rest of the bullshit kind of overshadowed the deliciousness of the food which is a huge shame for everyone involved here. Without wanting to be patronising, I feel like for the bibimbap novices out there I should say NEVER get precooked beef or fried egg on top unless you can eat the whole thing in 2 seconds or like leathery beef and chalky dry egg yolks. And if you do, then I want absolutely nothing to do with you - fuck off!!!!!!",

    "text": "I've wanted to go to this place for ages. We went on a Monday and as is everywhere in Soho it was busy. This unfussy and informal place is great-there's a long bench for single diners (why can't more restaurants stop treating single diners as lepers!). Walls are covered with photos taken of diners and posters of K Pop stars-all very Seoul. The food was fantastic. We had crispy chilli squid, panko breaded prawns and some kimchi to start (I understand it's almost an insult not to have the latter!). All were excellent, the squid was crispy as promised and spicy. For mains we all bowed down to king Bibimbap. This bowl of lovelyness comes in a red hot stone bowl. I've never eaten anything before that remains hot to the last mouthful. And what a mouthful-full of flavour, I could have eaten another straight after. Service was youthful and friendly. We washed it all down with Hite beer. What are you waiting for?",

For those of you who live under a rock, it's basically an assortment of toppings (veg, etc.) on a bed of rice in a hot stone pot. You can order a fried egg for a pound, to which hot sauce is then added, and then everything is mixed together. Looks absolutely revolting... tastes surprisingly good. Coming from someone who has no clue what bi bim bap SHOULD taste like, I thought it was delicious for \u00a38.95. Although, it wasn't amazing.",
