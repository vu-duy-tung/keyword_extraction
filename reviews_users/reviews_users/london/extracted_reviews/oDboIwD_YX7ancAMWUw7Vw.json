I had artichokes and squid for starter (squid for great, artichoke was a bit average) and my main, a prawn casserole was so so good. My friend and the sausage to start and they tasted beautiful! One of the waitresses snatched our bread bowl off the table when we still had bread in it...it was very rude and strange. When we paid our bill we asked to take the 12.5 service charge off and when our server asked why we told her about what happened with the other waitress and she didn't apologise or anything and this makes me not want to go back....we didn't do anything wrong!!! It was a real shame because there was a lot right with this place too.",

    "text": "ou know those days when you wake up craving chickpeas? No, me neither, but the Vole pleaded pulses so I cancelled a planned trip to Hawksmoor (the things we do for love) and we headed to Tas on The Cut. It's one of the first and largest branches of this thriving, good value Turkish chain and our bill came to an end of the month pleasing \u00a342 including a bottle of wine and coffees.If they've skimped on anything, it's not the decor.. Clean light woods, plants and linen tablecloths take this flagship upmarket enough for that snooty auntie, if not a key client. The wipe-clean laminated menu lets the side down a little, but that's a minor whinge... The food is good, simple and authentic (at least to my untutored palate). We go for one of the set meze menus, the Renk, they're all broadly similar combinations of hot and cold small plates but this one includes Borek, \u00a0small filled, fried, filo parcels I'm an absolute sucker for. There's also a two course, more Anglicised menu, ideal for snooty auntie.Standouts include the aforementioned \u00a0Borek, hot but ungreasy, stuffed with soft cheese and spinach, a smoky stewed aubergine number, palate cleansing parsley and mint tabbouleh, fresh and crunchy and some excellent bread. Less of a success were the deep-fried mussels, little chewy sacks of salt in a too thick batter, and a solid falafel, puckish in the wrong way.",

    "text": "My sister and I met a friend for dinner last night and this area seemed to be a ghost town with many of my restaurant choices not open on Sunday evening. By the way, the new iPhone Yelp app is brilliant, fast and responsive in finding nearby restaurants.So we all went to The Cut, which is usually reliable for eating places. The Anchor and Hope was closed, so we settled on Tas on the opposite side of the road.Tas is part of a chain of Turkish restaurants in south London. The menu has many Mediterranean staples but also some more interesting options as well.The service was very efficient with dishes and orders arriving promptly. Tap water was provided without any complaint.We started with deep fried salmon cubes served with sour rose sauce, spinach and feta cheese boreks and fried egg with oak smoked cured beef. The salmon cubes were moist with a good crunch from the batter contrasting with the nice sauce. The boreks were nice. I was intrigued with the egg and cured beef but sadly the beef was far too salty.For main course, I had a mixed grill of chicken, lamb and kofte, which was lovely and moist if a touch over-seasoned. Sis had diced lamb, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers cooked with herbs and our friend had minced beef and couscous balls, organic chickpeas, baby potatoes & dried red basil. Both dishes were pronounced nice by those who ordered them but tasted quite similar.For dessert, we shared a sultac rice pudding made with rice, milk, rose-water, corn flour, orange rind and mazaki. Indulgently creamy, it was a nice end to the meal.A good solid restaurant which stood in well for other better establishments, which were closed",

    "text": "I went to this Turkish restaurant for the first time a year ago and had a great meal so was looking forward to going again recently. I wasn't disappointed, and the special promotions were still on this time too. For a two course meal from the set menu it is \u00a38.95 which is less than the price of a main course in most central London restaurants.To start I ordered Hummus and it came with warm bread which tasted really fresh. For main course I ordered a chicken shish which came with some fried onions and couscous. Although it looked a bit dry, once I started eating the flavours were so great that it really didn't need a sauce. The couple at the table next to us ordered the mezze which has many small dishes to share, like tapas, all of which looked delicious.The service is really good here, the waiters are rushing around and shouting in Greek to one another but are always polite and deliver extra drinks or bread very quickly after you order. It can get very busy during the week with the office crowd at around 6pm so try it at the weekends to avoid the queues.",

The service is good without being in your face, and there is usually a guitarist (classical, spanish) at the restaurant on a Friday or Saturday evening. It's popular with theatregoers as it sits very near the Young Vic, and the Old Vic isn't far away either. I recommend the sardines cooked in foil; really delcious.

The menu is extensive, almost too extensive as its extremely hard to decide exactly what you might like to eat! This conundrum is somewhat solved by the set menus, which offer a good selection of starter (meze) choices, followed by a main course of your choice. Excellent for vegetarians as a large proportion of the food is vegetarian or vegan, and its all freshly cooked on the premises. The aubergine dishes are particularly nicely done, never have I had such nice aubergine. When you arrive at your table you are given complimentary olives and fresh warm bread with a yoghurt and dill dip to whet your appetite. If you can manage dessert there is a good traditional selection, I particularly like the Baklava. Good for families and groups of friends, and its best to book in advance for friday and saturday evenings although there are a lot of tables both upstairs and downstairs.",

We ordered the larger meze and asked for vegetarian only which was easy to do as most of the dishes are vegetarian anyway. The dips and salads were delicious and the lunch was most enjoyable. The bread though nice was served in a very small portion and we had to ask for more. It did seem stingier than in other Turkish restaurants. The service was a little slow especially since there were not many customers - maybe the team members work better when they're busy. They also came to clear the plates when we still had quite a lot of food left to eat and I was too polite to say to my business colleague that I wanted to eat more! So a slightly lower grade experience than I had previously at the Borough High Street Tas but I would recommend if you like Turkish food and don't need a lot of bread.",

I have to say the flavour and the quality of the dish were amazing, very hearty and perfect for those rainy days when you want something warming and homely. Absolutely loved it!As this is a chain all over London I would totally recommend checking it out and trying some of the stews and proper cooked food!",

    "text": "My partner and I are both vegetarians, so I generally love Turkish food, alongside other eastern Mediterranean cuisines, for offering tasty, good value dishes, with lots of possibilities, from the traditional starter-main-dessert approach, to meze, which are the original sampling venues. My partner and I opted for vegetarian meze.On the plus side,the experience delivered good food, a decently priced white wine and reasonably swift service. On the down side, I found it a bit noisy (others describe it as 'buzzing', so it depends what you are after). The tables are also quite close together, so don't come here for a date, unless you wish to entertain your neighbours with your amorous sweet nothings. The worst bit was the service: the surliest of waiters gave us the meze with a meat option instead of the veggie one. We complained and fortunately the item was replaced and we got a different waiter. The rest of the meal went swimmingly - leave room for baklava as dessert - except a slightly overly-long wait for the bill.Better service would have delivered four stars, but I'd be willing to eat here again.Update: 5/10/14 - Another meal, this time trying the \"Renk\" meze menu (the vegetarian option). A meal for three with some baklava shared for dessert, and soft drinks came to \u00a320 each. Much better service this time, so I've upped it to 4 stars.",

We ordered the run of the mills of Humus, a bit more olive old would have been great, the bread was good. \u00a0My dinner companion had a Mixed Grill -- Karisik Izgara : A mix of grilled chicken, lamb & kofte, but the favor was lost in the pool of tomato sauce. \u00a0I had a Asthma Yaprakli Sardalya-Sardines wrapped in vine leaves and ezme salata. \u00a0I thought the mixed grill is very good, the seasoning and taste are authentic, (too bad for the sauce) \u00a0I like my sardines, it was cooked nicely and still juicy. That is why it only gets a 3 stars from me.",

    "text": "There's no food I like better for sharing with friends than a big, fresh mezze feast. That's exactly what we were in the mood for after Matisse-ing at the Tate, so 4 of us wandered to one of a few Tas restaurants in the area.The sound hits you first as you walk in, as the place is always full and conversation lively, with tables crammed close together. We were luckily seated straight away but in the calmer (and ten degrees colder!) downstairs area.Bread arrives straight away - warm, fluffy and very dunkable in everything else we ordered (hurrah for the free refills). I've been disappointed with the meats/grills here before so instead we went to town on a range of hot and cold mezze type dishes, which hit the spot. They do the basics like humus and tabbouleh well, and I tried to throw in as many dishes involving goat's cheese as possible which I love. One of my fave hot dishes were these courgette, goat's cheese and carrot patties which I wouldn't have picked myself but were so tasty.I should say I would totally recommend these dishes by name if I was able to pronounce them - I usually give this a good go so as not to be rude, but hearing me attempt the likes of 'bademli peynir ezmesi' would have had the waiter in stitches. Don't worry, 'the artichoke one' and pointing works just fine too ;)All good stuff then, but no more than 3-stars after being let down by some questionable service - most of the waiting staff were unable to tell us what anything was, whilst the rest pretended they hadn't heard the question. There was a farcical sequence when we asked for the freezing air-con flow to be aimed away from us, only for various waiters to each turn it up or down as they passed. Also the guy pouring our water seemed to get more on the tablecloth/my friend's mobile than into the glasses.So bring some patience (and maybe a cardigan) and you're all set to affordably stuff yourself happy!",

We all ordered different main courses all of which were excellent and quite unique. \u00a0It is great to see them made in the open kitchen.The Turkish house wine is a winner, too. \u00a0A good evening all around.",

To be fair, I found these to be common problems among the mid range to swankier restaurants in London: always gun shy on seasoning, too light a touch on fat and salt, and trying much too hard to be creative (though Taz isn't guilty of the latter).Wayne's fav pick: lamb kofte atop leak bedding or the lamb kebab. Ask for the special chili to pair (it's also been referred to as the 'salsa').",

    "text": "Coming from Metro-Detroit, I didn't have a ton of options where Turkish is concerned, I was excited to one day gorge (rather shamelessly) on Turkish delights of all kinds as soon as I moved to the UK. The Tas restaurant group was on my list.My husband surprised me with a trip there after a rather rough day and it was, to say the least, a welcome escape.The restaurant is crowded. Even on weekdays, so book ahead. You'll find a cozy table awaiting you. Sit, order a bottle of the house red (which we polished off, thank you very much!) and cheese pate and olives. Cheese pate, cheese pate - where have you been my whole life? What I had mistaken for hummus was an aromatic myriad of flavors, slightly strong but appetizing nonetheless. We pleaded for more while awaiting our mains to arrive. Being vegetarians, Tas offers you a large variety of options. Instead of ordering large mains, we ordered about five or six small dishes, cold and hot meze, ranging from the halloumi salad to the borek, everything perfectly portioned for two very hungry (and buzzed from Turkish wine) people. Everything came quickly, making it slightly difficult to find space on the table but no worries - we dug in. The service was friendly, efficient but almost hard to reach - with this many patrons, it's almost hard to get the attention of the staff. Dessert was my favorite - stuffed apricots, a recent obsession of mine.This was my first Tas experience, I will be sure to come back! I'm rating it fairly for a good first experience but don't know too much about Turkish cuisine, this being my second visit in a Turkish establishment. I look forward to many more! Some of the dishes were a bit bland but all were fresh and tasty.",

Lots of people, lots of kids, lots of smiling faces. All good signs.We ordered the meze meals @ 17.95 and wow! what great tastes. Everything had that lovely spicing vs yogurty creaminess, everything was very very good.

    "text": "Really liked this restaurant!My friend and I both got the three-dish menu (two starters and a main each), and even though it was delicious, the loss of a star is mainly because although we asked if it would be too much food for just two people, our server assured us it was our best option. Good god - maybe if you haven't eaten in days, and/or are making an effort to eat as much as you can, it really is the best option, but next time, rest assured- we will be getting the two-dish option (and trust me, that's more than enough for dinner). As for the food itself- as people who aren't exactly Turkish food connoisseurs, we were more than delighted with the quality of our dishes. I think overall, we tried the hummus, falafel, tabouleh, marinated squid, mixed vegetable cous-cous, and stuffed vine leaves. All of them were fantastic- I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favourite! As for desserts, we were too full to try any, but the group next to us had the baklava, and it looked amazing. Definitely a place to revisit, now that I'm more familiar with their portion sizes!",
