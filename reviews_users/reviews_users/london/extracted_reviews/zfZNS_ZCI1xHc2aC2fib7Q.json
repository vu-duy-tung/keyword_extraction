The food from Mangal is worth the drive, the traffic, the wait to get served..it's worth squeezing in wherever they can fit you, hell if the car is out of action, it's worth the bus ride. The food is fantastic. The mixed grill is so so good. It comes with, well..a mixed selection of meat from the grill (duh) but along with that you get some lovely bread & really good salad. Add to this some of the aubergine dip and a few other tasty morsals from the fire, and you can feast on a mountain of food for under a tenner each. Can't recommend this place enough.",

This came out quickly - four slices of incredibly thin, crispy dough topped with a savory mix of minced lamb, onions and peppers. There was a nice bit of spicy kick to this as well and it was really delicious. I'm declaring it the best 2 quid starter I've ever had. Next up was one mixed kebab to share - there were grilled pieces of lamb, lamb chops, some kind of rolled up lamb thing, minced lamb with spices, and chicken wing. This was all accompanied by an incredibly fresh salad with rocket, carrots, red cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions and some vegetable that might have been jicama? Add in BYOB and it's our new favorite in the area!",

This is the best food I had while I was in London by far.I was underwhelmed when I walked in to the restaurant (as a foreigner travelling alone, I had to take a 40 minute train ride and then walk through the ghettoest looking place I had been to in England to get to this restaurant. I had read many great things but the restaurant didn't wow me when I entered - it was small, bare, and there were few if no patrons inside)That all changed after I sat and took notice of the place. All the kababs were on display in a small fridge at the front of the restaurant. Something I've never seen in anywhere else (that may be how they do it in England.. I'm not sure). And the meat? they cook it over a charcoal bbq right in the main room. I have recommended multiple friends here and the two who actually tried it sent me messages raving about it.One friends message\"is this the turkish restaurant you went to in london??I went today and it was the most delicious thing in the worldd...YESSS and also they have a lamb shishkebab in yogurt with soggy bread pieces too. I could eat that for every meal for the rest of my life\"I had the mixed kabab platter which had some of the best kabab I have had in my life. I am Persian and if you know Persian people, this is something we eat at a lot of meals. My family cooks used to cook kababs on a charcoal bbq inside our small apartment in the winters (Yes.. smoke everywhere). The smoky bbq grilled eggplant in yogurt + butter was even better than the kababs. Did I mention that kababs are my favourite dish.. ever?",

Reading Pamuk rarely does anything much for me, to be honest, but I'm always up for a good meal.The proposed venue, after the said friend's diligent research, was to be this Mangal Ocakbasi in this part of town that we Central-London-lovers had never been to. Time to expand our horizons and discover more about the city, we figured and off we went on our mission, which took more time than we anticipated because of the changes and delays on the train. But it was a balmy summer evening and time moved slowly and fluidly. To keep our spirits up (no puns intended) at this BYOB place, we took along some fabulous and crisp French white wine and a Hungarian dessert wine, of the Tokaji variety, from my visit to Budapest earlier in the year.We arrived at the place significantly later than our reservation time but they didn't kick up a fuss over it although it would be completely understandable if they did. The four of us hung about for about five minutes in front of the Ocakbasi, savouring the sights and smells of the various meats on offer and we saw something that we unanimously agreed looked like a top winner - the Adana Kofta, a spicy minced meat kebab on skewers. There is an energy and a frantic pace about the place that I instantly took a liking to. The waiter playfully 'stole' my bouquet of flowers, only to put it away in a vase for me while we had dinner. He also chilled our two bottles of wine while we decided on our orders. Perusing the menu, we soon started getting nervous for our vegetarian friend because the offerings were clearly very meat heavy and whatever veggie options there were, most of them seemed to be heavily dosed with aubergine...did I mention the said veggie friend has a morbid aversion to aubergines? Oh great.Thankfully, the veggie mixed meze platter saved the day; it was so delightful when shared that my vegetarian friend decided to go for it again as the main course for herself and hooray, that was a problem solved. The rest of us decided to make up for the meat deficit by ordering the special mixed kebab platter loaded with a variety of meats including quail, Adana kofte and what not - the salad portions were generous and enough to deflect any guilt from such a shamelessly meat-heavy meal. The meats (of all variety served here) were succulent and delicious and the Adana kofte was indeed deserving of a special mention. The free flow of breads was most welcome, given how fresh and well-made they were but prepare for a big meal unless you have good self control... We washed it all down with our wines and followed it with a delightful and not overly sweet Baklava (or two) each... When the bill arrived, it was with some pleasant shock that we realised that we'd spent only about a tenner each. Yep, definitely going back there again...despite the trek! Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service and all I can say is, beware of the numerous establishments with the same name, head to the real one and enjoy :)",

    "text": "For those that don't know it well, this is the don of kebab shops in the area. North east London is a pretty heavily Turkish place, and this part of the Kingsland Road has Turkish social clubs, hot nut shops, iskender kebab houses and ocakbasi (charcoal grill) restaurants in nearly every other building. I've sampled a decent proportion of them, and Mangal is the only one I go back to.The reason? The atmosphere has to come above the food, even though the seasoned meat served on chargrilled skewers is delicious. Its a small place, narrow, tiled and deep. The charcoal grill is at the front (don't sit too close or you'll get showered with sparks!) where the chef turns and blackens his lamb, beef, fish and chicken kebabs.I almost always get some type of lamb. The whole grilled green peppers are good too - even better with a beer! 'Patlican' is another recommended dish - grilled aubergine which is mashed with herbs and served with delicously fresh Turkish flat bread. I've seen this served unmashed on a skewer with lamb pieces before, but its as good like this.Prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is no secret among locals, so be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes for a table if you arrive at a peak time.",

But this review is for their new pop up Mangal 1.1 in bedroom bar in Shoreditch.Launching new at Bedroom Bar is Dalston Turkish institution Mangal 1.1 so had try a little bite of Charcoal grilled goodness dying their soft launch last week. Lamb shish & Lamb Chops w/ a side of cacik sauce and breads they were both good but I can't help feel the prices of over \u00a310 for each are bit overthetop. Esp as a frequent regular to a lot of Turkish eateries in green lanes and east London. For same price I could normally get a platter feeding you for 3 days!So due to pricing not quality I would say it's good but go to original or one of many on green lanes to get your Turkish fix.",

    "text": "Authentic Turkish Mangal (which means barbecue and explains why there are so many!)The food is cooked on a massive charcoal grill at the from of the main restaurant. If you're sat in this area, beware. You will end up smelling of charcoal by the end of your meal. Larger groups are say in a secondary part of the restaurant. Thankfully far enough away from the grill smoke.The place is super busy and full. There seem to always be people queuing for the tables, so booking is advised for dinner. Prices are quite expensive for Dalston, so there must be something special right?Well, not really. Here is why. The turkish bread served that is complimentary, is served simply plain. No dip or sauces. None that are included anyway. Plus the mains will set you back \u00a310-20. Not cheap for charcoal grill. Best Mangal I, in West Kensington is cheaper than this, even for the mixed grill. Disappointing.Secondly, the meat itself. The meat itself is quite small and stingy. No doubt, you won't leave hungry, given all the bread and free salad, butt the meat is unconvincing in both quality. When you arrive for instance, there are really juicy looking lamb medallions in the display. However with the mixed grill special costing \u00a317.50, you are given a single bony piece of lamb cutlet. However not to be a negative nancy, the meat there did taste great. Nicely charred.The highlights are that the place does BYOB, so you can get cheap drink from the newsagents nearby before arriving. However, remember that this place is popular, so as soon as you finish your dishes, you're kicked out because they need the table for another group.In all honesty, try Best Mangal in West Kensington. Much better bread and meats along with some delicious looking desserts. Plus better value for money.",

    "text": "In Dalston you're spoilt for choice for Turkish restaurants so picking one was tough, although yelp helped and seeing from a few reviews that this place has BYO meant it was a winner!We tried to book a table in advance but you can't do we turned up and luckily there was space. It's a really small area at the back of what may have been just a take away place once upon a time. The tables were crammed in and it was full within 5mins of us being seated. We checked that it was still BYO and luckily it was so we asked for glasses for our bottle of wine. It seems they do sell beer but are still ok with BYO.We weren't hugely hungry and the starters were a little disappointing on the menu so we just went straight for the mains. We ordered the lamb yogurtlu beyti and the tavuksis. They brought out a big basket of bread too. I'm a big fan of Turkish bread and I was so pleased it came out warm. \u00a0It was a bit doughy and undercooked though, but still perfectly edible.The salad that came with the chicken was pretty big and really colourful but I was a little disappointed with the food generally. It was ok but we used to live near Green Lanes in Harringey so we've been spoilt with excellent Turkish food. The food here was lower quality and the portion sizes were much smaller, whilst being more expensive. I also found a bit of blue latex glove in the middle of the lamb in the yogurtlu beyti. It wasn't bad and the fact you can take your own booze is brilliant but I've had much better.",

As usual I had the Adana Kofte and yogurt \u00a0while my husband had the mix grilled meat. I was happy with my Adana as it was tender and tasteful especially being fresh off the grill. The mixed grilled meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. It was neither dry nor undercooked according to my husband's tastebuds. We also had the mix cold meze which was good but slightly underwhelming. It did not come with the rice and meat wrapped in grapes leaves and the portions were smaller including the side salads that came with our main meal. As for service, it was mediocre. No frills, straightforward and nothing else. The restaurant area feels a little claustrophobic, dark and lacking an ambiance. Overall, it was good but there are better ones in the area.",

I spent an afternoon in the londesborough pub and a local recommended Mangal to me. On my first visit I was left gobsmacked at the amazing food and value. \u00a0These days the food is nearly as good but the prices have gone up a bit. The service has also plummeted.We waited 30 minutes for a table. We didn't mind but every table of 4-6 behind us got a table before us. The food at mangal is still very good. \u00a0The patlican salata and bread are a great starter for 2 and I'd recommend the mixed grill to share. \u00a0The waiter urged us to get two but it really isn't necessary. One of the big appeals is their BYO policy and everyone comes armed with bags of booze.What has changed is the atmosphere and the price. \u00a0As we finished the last mouthful of our mains the bill was catapulted at our table as there were people waiting who needed our table. \u00a0At the same time our neighbours (two other guys) were asked to move table mid meal. \u00a0Mangal has morphed from a local, friendly and relaxed restaurant into a mechanical churn of chargrilled meats.

    "text": "Used to come here most Friday nights a few years ago but for some reason haven't been in quite a while. Decided that it was high time I reacquainted myself with a decent bit of charcoal grillingOne thing that hadn't changed since my last visit was the very long queue stretching out of the door of people waiting for tables. Didn't fancy spending 15 to 20? minutes on a lovely Friday evening waiting in a queue so went for the takeaway menu.I admit to being fairly hungry so ordered the 'Mixed Kebab' at \u00a312. Not cheap by any means but past experience made me think it was \u00a312 well spent.Jumped straight to the front of the queue and my order was quickly selected from the front fridge display of meats and placed on the grill. The first disappointment was that the bread wasn't placed on top of the grilling meat to warm it and soak up some of the meat juices. The grilled meat was placed in a container along with the dry room temperature bread and a small container of salad.The first item I tried was the (large) chicken wing. Was O.K but would have liked it to have spent more time on the grill to crisp up the skin. Next was a round piece of lamb. Sorry to say that it was like chewing a piece of rubber. The lamb chop was spot on delicious. The outside crispy and charred yet the meat meltingly tender. 5 or 6 chucks of chicken breast were just plain tasteless. The minced skewer kebab was nice with good but not overpowering seasoning (lots of places over salt) and properly cooked.As I said the bread about the size of a round dinner plate was stone cold and so gave this odd hot cold thing with the meat. Salad was appallingly small and had no seasoning apart from a small and rather 'dry' wedge of lemon. If it had been twice the size and had some dressing it would have been O.K Overall hugely disappointing. I guess they won't be that worried at losing my future \u00a0custom as they seemed to be hugely busy but I can't see that continuing unless they raise there game.",

It is BYO, which is handy. Be warned that they don't take card payments.",
