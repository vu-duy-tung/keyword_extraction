I figured a full English Breakfast would be just what the doctor ordered, along with lots of hydrating beverages, like OJ, sparkling water, and peppermint tea. It was glorious. Friendly and timely service, and a ridiculously large and satisfying meal. Just what I needed.",

The sort of place you come for the atmosphere, homely food and friendly efficient service rather than the decor.Don't get me wrong, the wooden tables rattan chairs and basic decor may have seen better days but this place is spotless and comforting. Like any good Italian cafe they have footie on the TV and it's a warm inviting place to hang out even if you only want coffee and pastries.The menu ranges from salads to meat, fish and pasta with something for everyone. While my spaghetti Bolognese was competent rather than outstanding, it was a good plate of warming, tasty food for very little money and every dish that came out to the tables around me looked and smelled good.I really liked Mimo's, I left feeling comforted and full and am glad it's right next door to my regular London hotel. I will drop by often if I am in the area.",

    "text": "Before I write this review.. I shall mention that this was the place we decided to go to after we had horrible service at Peking Seoul. But Wow. Just.. WOW.. This place is kind of like a hole in the wall. Friggin amazing! Me and my friend was craving italian food, and one of the best places I found was Kitchen Italia in Covent Garden, but we didn't want to go out of our way... so we decided to just walk around the Paddington area and found this place.Food:Upon entering, the place looked like any other typical shop.. or so I thought. I sat down and noticed the decor, and the place had a very homely feel. Instantly, we were greeted by the waitress and the chef. They were all VERY VERY helpful. I was friggin starving and wanted to eat, but everything sounded really good. So I ended up asking the waitress and she had recommended \u00a0me the Tortalini Funghi 5.45 quid (Tortalini filled with cheese, fresh mushrooms in a creamy sauce. \u00a0DELICIOUS. The best I have EVER had. The pasta was fresh as in it was just cooked, and tasted homemade and not straight from the freezer. \u00a0Also as a side, I had garlic bread which was 2.50 quid for 4 thick slices that was melt in your mouth delicious! I would recommend asking for a side of pesto and spreading it on top of the bread.The minced meat pastry I thought was decent.. but it felt very filling.My friend had ordered a salami on ciabatta bread. The salami was SUPER fresh and tasty. Every bite was full of goodness.I was very curious how their portions were at their price... but it turned out that we had alot more than what we asked for. Our bill's total turned out to be 20 quid. 10 quid each? Not bad at all.. and we left STUFFED. I would recommend ordering 2 main dishes, garlic bread, and drinks... your bill will be about 14-16 quid. Not a bad deal at all.Service:Top notch. Anything I asked for, was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I really had appreciated it, because Peking Seoul had me pissed off. They really lightened my mood.There is only one thing I dislike about this place is the restroom accommodation. It's literally in the corner and you have to get past people by asking them to scoot in so you could open the door. I'm sure they could deal with one less table. But that's okay, they still deserve a 5 star rating!",

The food was just food, nothingspecial, nothing creative, no passion, perhaps even a bit bland. And theservice was just average. Not rude but could of been more friendly.

It's not trendy and even looks a bit sketchy with all these scary looking people smoking up front on the street. I only got to check out Mimo's one day because the other Italian restaurant up the street was close and I was craving pasta really bad. The waitress we had was friendly and helpful. The chef was flexible with our choices of side dish. \u00a0The service was a bit slow... I think they start boiling the pasta only when you order. The food was good, really good. I totally recommend this place for anyone who craves pasta out there. I had the one with bacon and cream sauce the first time I was there and went back another time for a smoked salmon lemon pasta with cream sauce. Both were rich and delicious. The second time I went with my parents who had steak and thought it was delicious but very fatty. We also tried the banana split which was a thumb down too. Even with that, I still would give them a 4-star for the pasta that gave me such sensation of satisfaction.",

While you watch a morning show on tv and sip on your coffee the friendly staff will make sure you have all you need.

They do it right, with bechamel sauce, which was absolutely fantastic. I was very pleasantly surprised. If you're in the Paddington area, or if you're craving delicious lasagna, stop by Mimo's!",

Although their food may be good, the service was absolutely horrible. The waitress who helped us was so rude to us and I wasn't sure if it was just how she acted or if it was because I was close to the same age as her and girls can be like that. She never came back to us after she gave us our food and just expected us to know that we had to go up to the till to pay. If you choose to try this place out I would recommend getting it to go so that you don't have to deal with their horrible service.",

It's a small restaurant so it can get fairly packed, but still, no one complains because of the great food and great price plus with its proximity to Paddington Train Station, you can't really go wrong. Will recommend to anyone visiting London UK!",

    "text": "My mother and I ate here during a recent trip to London. We more or less wandered in looking for some food near our hotel to help us recover from the long flight into the city. And I liked what I saw at Mimos Cafe. Located within walking distance of Paddington Station and the hotels associated with it, I remember Mimos as being a nice, little shop that specialized in a variety of affordable meals. I did not come in for brunch, but for dinner, so my menu primarily listed pastas and sandwiches. Not only are the items affordable, but you get your money's worth from your meals here. For example, a single \u00a34 panini was massive - large enough to be cut into three pieces! - and came with a small side salad, too. It was a lot of food, but it was enjoyable and I found it to be quite refreshing after a night of airline snacks.However, Mimos is admittedly a tiny place, so much so that when people began to come in to the cafe near the end of my meal the bathroom doors were blocked by guests, just due to the placement of the tables in the space that's available to them. With that in mind, it's probably not always the most comfortable of places to eat.That said, I will definitely remember this place - if not for the lovely staff, then for the kind locals who chit-chatted with my mother and I and welcomed us on our first day to the city with open arms. People like this make travel so much fun, and it's wonderful to know that a little cafe has that kind of environment to offer to tired (and yes, sometimes silly) tourists.",

I was very hungry so I got the full breakfast and a cappuccino! The cappuccino came out the perfect temperature, and was the perfect little pick me up to start my day! The breakfast was delicious, fresh,and filling. I loved the flavor of everything from the mushrooms, to the slightly salty bacon, and buttery toast! I sat inside but there are also a few tables outside as well. This is a must try for a quick breakfast in Paddington!",
