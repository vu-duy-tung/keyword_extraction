So, I was happy to see (and to taste!) that this more centrally situated venue lives up to the same high standards.",

Good luck getting a seat.It looks like the future of pho is rosy - I mean the eponymous noodle soup, rather than this cafe. Pho has risen from a cult following among ex-pat Vietnamese to the lastest must try meal across the USA. It was only a matter of time before it jumped the pond. And here it is in all its marketable glory... in a hip and sanded-down modern restaurant bustling with interesting people and novel dinnerware.The only thing to try for me was the pho, although other vietnamese and thai dishes are on offer and those wet behind the ears seem to plump for them. I liked the pho but didn't rate it too highly, it was somewhat... different, weaker and a tad tepid.And here's the crux of the problem for what is otherwise a great lunch option - it feels here like a Brit has decided Pho is the next big thing and gone and got some maybe Vietnamese chefs to drum up some recipes with what is buyable in London. It doesn't rate compared to the deep flavours of the established pho houses in the states. It's not on par. But strangely, neither was pho when I had it in Laos, Hanoi or at the much cheaper (and better) Vietnamese places on Kingsland Rd. It seems like the immigrants from Saigon to California are the real experts. If you want to really get your pho up to crack-cocaine addictiveness... hire one of those chefs.Ok, so far I resisted any pho-puns. But I have to do one.# Pho is the PhoTure.You can shoot me now.",

    "text": "Pho Caf\u00e9 - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) After my recent visit to Vietnam, where I consumed copious amounts of Pho and other delicious local dishes, I was thrilled to be invited by the gorgeous Rachelle of Qype to visit Pho Caf\u00e9 in London's Great Titchfield Street. I was also intrigued by this invitation as, in London, I admit never venturing outside Kingsland Road for my regular fix of Vietnam's national dish. Pho Caf\u00e9 is one of those restaurants I was ready to dislike. Owned by an English couple and with three branches in London (Clerkenwell, Oxford Circus and Westfield), the cafes have a trendy decor and cater for a mostly Western clientele \u00a0I feared it would lack authenticity. Having dreamt about opening my own restaurant for the last 20 years, I feel inspired whenever I meet people like Stephen and Juliette Wall. They were clearly passionate about Vietnamese cooking and the quality of the food served at their restaurants. They gave a touching account of their trials and tribulations starting Pho 5 years ago (and getting married in the process). We were then shown how to prepare goi cuon tom (fresh rice paper rolls filled with vermicelli noodles, prawns, salad and herbs) by one of their chefs (all their kitchen staff are Vietnamese). These were fresh and delicious and similar to the ones I'd just eaten in Vietnam. At \u00a33.75, I felt that they were also well priced. This was followed by two other delicious starters/sides \u00a0Cha Gio \u00a0fried pork spring rolls \u00a33.95 and Nem nuong \u00a0grilled pork and lemongrass meatballs \u00a34.50. These are the simplest of starters, but good quality versions are very hard to find, hence I never order them in Vietnamese restaurants in London. Pho's versions were delicious, fresh and obviously made on the premises. We were also served Goi du du \u00a0a salad of shredded green papaya with prawns and herbs topped with peanuts @ \u00a35.95. Again the most popular of Vietnamese salads, this was a perfect example of Goi Du Du - very aromatic and ultra fresh. The Goi ga \u00a0chicken salad with peppers, mixed herbs with chilli and ginger dressing @ \u00a35.45 was also excellent. I loved the combination of shredded chicken, peppers and finely sliced shallots, with the chilli and ginger dressing giving it a zingy lift. Juliette took us to visit the kitchen where we saw their large vat of pho stock simmering away. It looked fantastic, and the kitchen was filled with the most delicious aromas of beef, star anise, cinnamon and other spices. I had a lot of trouble deciding which of their 11 different types of Pho I would have, but opted for Pho bo dac biet \u00a0rice noodle soup with steak, brisket and meatballs served with fresh herbs @ \u00a37.95. This was much anticipated, and I have to admit it was extremely good. The stock was concentrated but still with a sophisticated flavour \u00a0the meats were also delicious, as were the noodles which had been cooked perfectly. For dessert, I had a Chuoi Chien \u00a0banana fritters with honey and ginger ice cream @ \u00a34. I loved the flavours of this dessert \u00a0the deep fried bananas were covered with a deliciously crispy batter and went very well with the honey and ginger ice cream. In Vietnam, beer is traditionally drunk with food at restaurants and on special occasions. Pho serves all major Vietnamese beers like Halida, Hue and Saigon for \u00a33.25 as well as Beer Laos at \u00a33.45. I was also impressed by how well priced their wine list is. Bottles start at \u00a313.95 for a delicious French Viognier (which I tasted) and go up to \u00a316.25 for an Australian Riesling or \u00a317.95 for a Kiwi Sauvignon Blanc. I find that for Oriental food in general, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Viognier and Riesling are nearly always the best matches. Stephen and Juliette have made Vietnamese food accessible to Londoners \u00a0there are no plastic lobsters hanging on the walls, the menus are well explained, and the serving staff are friendly and articulate. In May, they will be opening a branch in Brighton, and another in Soho is also scheduled to open later in 2010. Cost: this was a complementary meal, but I have quoted the prices of all the dishes I tried. I estimate that a meal for one would cost in the region of \u00a315 including a starter, pho and dessert but excluding drinks. Likes: probably the most delicious bowl of pho outside the 'pho mile' (Kingsland Road or thereabouts), excellent value for money and fantastic banana fritter with honey and ginger ice cream. The wine list is also well priced and includes some attractive choices. Dislikes: despite the simple but well thought out menu (40 items only), I missed some old favourites like chargrilled beef and lemongrass wrapped in betel leaves and fried soft shell crab. Verdict: Simple but well executed menu just off Oxford Street at very affordable prices. An excellent choice for Vietnamese food outside Kingsland Road. Recommended.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  The last time I visited South East Asia, I left with a salty mane of plaited hair, a battered back pack and a tan which blended beautifully into my dirt brown bathers (quite a feat considering my natural moon tan). I did not leave with the entrepreneurial inclination to set up my own mini chain of London restaurants replicating my favourite highlights of the local cuisine. Most likely, I was too busy trying to untangle my hair before the cameras came out - complete nightmare. However, that is exactly what husband and wife team, Stephen and Juliette Wall have done. Having travelled around South East Asia and fallen in love the pho soups (pronounced \"feu\"), they ditched their office jobs 5 years ago and set up Pho (pronounced \"fow\", in a kind of oh-for-Goddsakes-I-give-up concession to the locals). The first Pho restaurant opened on St John Street in Clerkenwell in 2005 and since then they have multiplied like cheeky gizmos into branches in Great Titchfield Street and Westfield Shopping Centre. In May, the new Brighton branch is due to open, and a new site in Soho has just been purchased. Coming from Australia, a country abound in fresh, flavourful, colourful Vietnamese fare, TPG and I have found it quite an ordeal to find decent Vietnamese food in London outside of Kingsland Road. Fresh and zesty, Vietnamese food should be packed with the full range of spicy, sour, bitter, salty and sweet flavours. To date, Cay Tre is a favourite. However, it was on our maiden voyage to Westfield last year that we first discovered Pho, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a gorgeous bowl of noodle soup in a shopping centre food court. Since then, our experiences at the Great Titchfield Street restaurant have been more mixed as we found the flavours sometimes lacked the punch of our first experience depending on our order. Therefore, I happily accepted an invitation to visit Pho with some other bloggers last week, to learn more about the business first hand. It's too easy to accuse a chain restaurant, and particularly a Vietnamese chain being run by non-Vietnamese people, of being bland and inauthentic. The husband and wife team at Pho have employed a full team of Vietnamese cooks, have done their utmost to remain true to the fresh Vietnamese flavours of their travels and have kept to simple menu focussed mainly on what they do best - the pho. A pho is a serious business, afteall, and is not to be treated lightly. Taking on the status of a revered national dish in Vietnam, it's basically a noodle soup containing chicken, beef, pork, tofu or prawns, eaten at all times of day in its natural habitat - often on a plastic chair at the side of a street cart. The pho stocks at Pho are prepared from scratch on site, and take up to 12 hours to prepare, simmering away alluringly in large vats in the kitchen. We started with a lesson demonstrating how to make our own goi cuon tom (fresh rice paper rolls filled with prawns, salad and herbs). Some call them \"summer rolls\" but, to the Aussie girl in me, a Summer Roll will always involve chocolate, peanuts, coconut and nougat (highly recommended, by the way). Platters of fried spring rolls followed, filled with pork (a favourite) or veggies, as well as nem nuong (pork and lemongrass meatballs - I somehow missed these) and ginormous bursting platters of goi du du (papaya salads alternatively containing chicken or prawns). Papaya salad or a Vietnamese chicken salad is always an essential when I visit any Vietnamese restaurant, and Pho's versions were lovely, refreshing and tasty, although I prefer slightly more of a chilli hit (I'm sure you could ask for it). Having spied the sensational looking beef stock brewing away in the kitchen, my bowl of the pho bo dac biet did not disappoint (noodle soup with steak, brisket and meatballs - the beefy trifecta - why limit yourself to 1 style of beef?). As always, it was served with a side of herbs, lime and chilli to be added to taste. The flavours were subtle but lovely, and as always, I find pho to leave me feeling healthy and replenished. Serving sizes are satisfyingly generous - particularly given they fall within a \u00a36.95 - \u00a37.95 price range. Hot and spicy soups and noodle dishes are also on offer, but save room for the banana fritter with honey and ginger ice-cream - oh my. I'm sure there was a bit of \"I'll have what she's having\" going on as I enthusiastically enjoyed mine. I rate Pho as a terrific option for a healthy, tasty and fulfilling meal, particularly if you love Vietnamese food as much as I do, and particularly if you find yourself on the other side of town to the strip of Vietnamese places on Kingsland Road. It's definitely the best option I've found around the West End for Vietnamese food. And having met the passionate duo behind the business, Pho now has a face - and I like it even more than",

    "text": "Full disclosure. Miss Rachelle from Qype invited me to this bloggers' event for which I received free food and drink over the course of the evening. Such a get-together is never going to replicate the experience of being a paying customer so please read on with that in mind. Pho has three London branches, Clerkenwell (the original), Westfield Shopping Centre, and Oxford Circus, where this event was held. Further branches in Brighton and Soho will open later this year. I hadn't been here before as I was a bit sceptical about what on the face of it seemed to be a high street chain cashing in on the trend for Vietnamese food. Not for the first time, my preconceptions were a bit off the mark, as Pho isn't run by some faceless corporate behemoth but by a couple. Stephen and Juliette Wall gave up the drudgery of the nine-to-five to follow their dream of opening a caf\u00e9 inspired by their travels in Vietnam. For those of you staring at the elephant in the room, they've hired Vietnamese kitchen crews to do the actual cooking. Truth is, you'd have to be made of stone not to be inspired by their story or to warm to their enthusiasm. The other thing I have to mention is that like me, Stephen is from the North West of England, where we're renowned for our intelligence, keen sense of humour, and generous spirit. Not to mention our modest self-deprecating manner. Now heartwarming tales about living the dream are all well and good but what about the food? A quick look at the menu is encouraging as it's pretty much 100% Vietnamese with no faddy interpretations of classic dishes. We kicked off with starters such as salads (goi), summer rolls (goi cuon), spring rolls (cha gio), and grilled pork & lemongrass meatballs (nem nuong). But before we tucked in, we had a stab at making one of my favourites, summer rolls. Thankfully, my effort tasted better than it looked! I can't get over excited about salad and spring rolls but both were freshly made and clean tasting. However, I did find the nem nuong meatballs incredibly moreish with the lemongrass giving a contrast in both taste and texture to the pork. In between starters and mains, we had a quick tour of the kitchen where the highlight was a giant vat of beef stock. When the lid was lifted, the kitchen was filled with a beefy aroma infused with star anise. As Pho specialises in pho, I had to go for pho noodles with beef stock, steak, brisket and meatballs (pho bo dac biet). Now, I may have had my expectations raised by the giant vat of stock but I thought the soup lacked a bit of oomph. It wasn't quite as beefy as the pho from Song Que (my favourite Vietnamese in London) and I added more chillies than I normally would. Of the three types of beef, the brisket was my favourite with its melt in the mouth texture. I also liked the meatballs and whilst there was nothing wrong with the steak, I'd probably give it a miss if I came here again. I also adore bun dishes so in the interest of research, I sampled some cold rice vermicelli topped with salad, herbs, spring roll, peanuts and lemongrass chicken (bun cha gio ga). This was served with nuoc cham, a spicy fish sauce based dressing and it was a decent bowl of bun. A minor gripe was that there weren't enough noodles but this was a sample bowl and I'm sure you'd get more in a normal sized bowl. By the way, their normal sized bowl is quite large \u00a0perhaps this is Stephen's influence, as Northerners don't really do small portions. After more than my fair share of starters, two bowls of noodles and several beers came dessert. I plumped for a refreshing strawberry and fresh basil sorbet. Others went for banana fritters - which I had nibble on - to round off the meal. I'm not really a dessert man but these were all fine. All in all, it was a top night out and it was good to meet other bloggers, many for the first time. Our hosts were charming and convivial as were the PR peeps. But one question remains \u00a0would I come back here as a paying customer? Well I wouldn't describe Pho as a destination for Vietnamese cuisine as that's obviously the 'Pho Mile', which is located in that part of town where Shoreditch becomes Hoxton. That said if I was out and about around Oxford Circus then I'd happily pop in here for a bowl of noodles. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.\u2026",

The bowls of noodles are huge - and I love the fact you can add your own herbs to your taste. The spicy noodles will leave your mouth tingling for about an hour afterwards. The cold noodles (Bun) are also pretty good if you're like me and tend to throw hot soup all over you as you eat it. They do provide bibs. A must if you're getting a spicy dish as the red sauce will stain like a bugger.

I had lots of time to spare today because class was cancelled so I decided to get a takeaway. The venue is quite small, and gets busy quickly. There was a 15 minute wait which was absolutely fine to me, ran the few errands I had while I waited for some noodly goodness. I bought Bun Chay, which is cold noodles with a warm stir fry of tofu and mushrooms, beansprouts, and other yums. The sauce that they cook it in is lovely! And I consistently bow down to Asian cuisine for making tofu taste amazing the way that no other cuisine I've found has been able to. The portion was quite large and satisfying, for just under a fiver. Great value :) I've actually never had Vietnamese food before so felt apprehensive, but I'm glad I tried it out because it was a nice experience. I look forward to trying actual pho, among the tasties on the menu :)",

I come from Northern California, and we NorCal peeps love our pho. If there isn't a pho restaurant around, you have pho-king crazed people looking for their pho fix. I lived 20 minutes from San Jose, which is PHO central! No really, no joke. It's pho-king amazing. We also have a restaurant called Pho Kim Long. Just wrap your head around that and chuckle for a few minutes.Okay, okay enough with the pho-king jokes, i get it! ;)I have to say that the noodles were mediocre, but the BROTH was good! I loved the abundant garnishes and sauces that made me feel quite homely. Our spring roll was divine. So good! Husband got a fried one while I had a rice wrapped one. Both were absolutely delicious. He had the pho combination while I had mine with perfect beef slices. Just so damned good. We also went right when they opened on a Saturday, so there was no line, no crowd, just a few tables taken. BLISS. Will return!",

I was spoilt for choice. \u00a0For the starter I had the Vietnamese crepe filled with prawns, chicken and beansprouts. \u00a0It was enormous and pretty yummy. \u00a0I would have ended my meal here had I known the portions! Having left my plate half full to leave room for the main, the waitress offered to box up my starter for me to take away. This I found charming. I took her up on her offer of course!Be shocked oh food snobs, I did not go for Pho as my main! Though many around me looked like they were enjoying their slurpy Pho. \u00a0I went for the Bun noodles with the lemongrass chicken, which surprisingly comes with lots of salad mixed in with it and a vegetable spring roll (winner). \u00a0It was not a taste explosion, but the vegetable spring roll was absolutely delish, none of that overfried stuff you get at Thai and Chinese places. \u00a0This one was a delight. \u00a0The main did not otherwise blow me away, but I came away feeling quite virtuous as it was super healthy and tasty enough (and yet another large portion).I was here for dinner and the restaurant was still full (as seems to be the case for the lunchtime crowd) and despite the queues at the door we did not feel rushed with our meal. \u00a0I'm quite sure I will be back as there are tons of things on the menu I still want to try, and the staff were lovely. \u00a0I think Pho could be the new Wagamamas.Enjoy x",

My companions seemed to feel equally satisfied but not overwhelmed by their mains of Beef Bun Noodles (also spicy) and Steak and Brisket Pho. Our waitress was new and quite sweet, if a little keen to take our order (even at lunchtime). I cannot say the same for the guy who appeared to be some kind of supervisor or manager, who on hearing our mention of potentially limited brisket in the Pho marched over to inform us in an unnecessarily authoritatively that we were mistaken, and that what appeared to be steak was actually brisket. This was totally unnecessary as it wasn't a complaint simply an answer to the waitresses innocent question about the brisket.This all makes me wonder how would he have behaved had we actually complained.Company present made this a 3 star but forsaking that I think this would probably have been a 2.",

Unfortunately, both of these were rendered pretty much inedible by the amount of salt added. We ordered them spicy but couldn't feel any heat from the chillies as our mouths were burning from the salt. It's a real shame because the dishes looked great and I bet without all the salt would have tasted great.",

To my surprise, the waitress came back out and asked if we want all our starters to be corriander free as well.

Last year, I was eating Pho off the street in Vietnam, this year to get my noodle kick, I eat it here. It's not exactly authentic, but then, it's not exactly far off either. I think the soup tastes remarkably similar to the ones I was eating my Pho with in Vietnam (it's all about the soup people!) and the garnishes are pretty much accurate too. Though there could be more of them. Note to Pho people... More leaves in the garnishes.I, too usually go for the beef noodles (think it's Pho tai), and the first time I went to a Pho (was admittedly in Westfields) it was amazing (the chefs were Vietnamese for sure) and this one near Oxford Circus is just convenient, really. The bun cha noodles (not sure if that's right) look amazing and it's on my list for next time, but also, the big plus is, there is no fat on my perfect beef slices. In Vietnam, you practically see the cow head bubbling alongside the meat in the soup, at least here, it's less of the visual and more of the slurping. Plus, there's a loyalty card. Gotta love those stamps!",

The prawns were really nice but the broth seemed strange, almost cinnamon-y but not enough flavour which I didn't think went very well with the other ingredients. The noodles were great though.

    "text": "3.5 but am rounding up. To be honest, it's average pho compared to better places like those on Kingsland Road. However, comparing against other Pho chains, it was the best I had. Broth came out hot and flavourful. Everything in general was fresh, though I wish they served more veggies. Service was generally good and prompt. No major hiccups, and they came by to check on me regularly. Ambience was the usual you would expect of any Pho chain. They had a lower ground level, though, so it can be nice if you're looking for a bigger space for a bigger group.",

The noodles was dry while the there were literally 6 small pieces of almost bone dry meat (Brisket) measuring 2x2 inches. What in the world!? Oh did I mention that they gave us very old looking- turning brown 6 mint and basil leaves? What a sad story especially when you are sick and looking forward to a solid Pho. NEVER Again!",

Tastes more like ramen than pho, but I loved the fusion taste because I love ramen too :)Definitely worth a try :)",

Which, amazingly, didn't mean I was going to get super annoyed by people getting in and out of the restaurant as I could barely notice them. But it was a warm day, so maybe I was lucky?This time I ordered a different noodle soup, one with steak and garlic, but odly enough I didn't prefer it over the veggie mushroom ones I had at the Soho branch. It sort of lacked flavour compared to the veggie one, and I had to add loads of chilli and hoi-sin sauce to add some taste. I ordered the flower green tea which was really really nice. The place seemed brighter though, and we were served very very quickly. Our table was a bit wonky but nothing too annoying. All in all another pleasant experience, it's becoming a staple in my diet nights out.",

Since any pho was free, I didn't hesitate when after for their recommendation they pointed to the second most expensive pho (I believe its usually \u00a312 something). It was the house special with beef and egg. My expectations were high. The presentation looked nice and the portion was sizable, but I was not impressed by the taste itself. It lacked that awesome brothy flavour that seeps into the noodles and just want impressive at all. Glad I didn't have to pay for it.",

The quality of the pho was alright here but it was the plate of bits that seemed lacking. You know, all those toppings you can DIY your pho with, coriander and basil and mint and chilies and lime and and and. (this seems to be a trend in the pho places Ive been to though)They had the sides but in a miniscule amount. So sad as it can enhance your pho so much while making you feel like you're getting a great deal for this huge mound of really mostly veg and herbs and sriracha...mmm cock sauce.Not usually in this area but if I come back I'll just remember to ask for two plates of toppings, if they'll allow it.",

    "text": "Having grown up in Southern California, home to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants outside of Viet Nam, I am obviously dubious when it comes to trying pho outside my home state. Pho Cafe has good food - the kitchen really cares about the preparation of the dishes and making them as authentic as possible. It's not the same as you would get from a mom & pop pho shop in SoCal but that's not to say it's not yummy.I come here regularly for lunch. It gets packed very quickly so come before 1:00pm if you want a seat. Takeaway is easy - call in and pick up from the counter on the lower ground floor. If you don't call in, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your food. It gets really busy during peak lunch hour.My favourite dishes include- cha gio (fried spring rolls)- cha nem (fried spring rolls with crab)- goi ga (chicken salad - don't be fooled by the name. This dish is hearty and healthy with fresh mint leaves to bring out the sweet-tangy dressing)- pho Tai Lan (garlic beef Hanoi style pho)- bun bo hue tom (spicy soup with prawns)My boyfriend loves the veggie spring rolls and tofu curry over rice. We've been meaning to come here for dinner to try the veggie pancake (banh xeo) which is only served during dinner time. It's hard to find banh xeo, even harder to find veggie banh xeo, in this city.My advice - if you're looking for Vietnamese food like in Chinatown in Paris or Little Saigon in Southern California - it's not the same. \u00a0Come try it anyway - you might like it as much as me.",

    "text": "I've always been a big fan of Pho, which is one of the few restaurants that always comes to my mind when friends ask me where we should go and eat. They are best, of course, for their pho noodles, which are authentically prepared and taste like the real deal, full of flavour. Among their noodles, go for their traditional beef pho, or their dry bun noodles. While their spicy noodles will thrill those who like a bit of chilli in their food, you will miss out on the clean flavours of the beef stock. For starters, my favourite are the prawn summer rolls, which come with a very addictive dipping sauce. In fact, I have often been tempted during my visits to Pho to just order several portions of the summer rolls and forgo a main course! Dessert-wise, the banana fritters with honey and ginger ice cream are heavenly. While you can get everything slightly cheaper and slightly more authentic in the Vietnamese restaurants on Kingsland Road, Pho is an extremely good choice if you're in central London or Westfield, as Kingsland Road is a bit in the middle of nowhere. Pho also do some excellent fruit juices, which go very well with their food. Reviewed by The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",

On the unfortunate occasion that I am forced to wade through the mobs on Oxford Street, I can now add this one to my list of oases. It even has a to-go option.The interiors are modern and the bright colours give it a trendy look. Split over two levels, I've never had trouble finding a table in this restaurant, during moderately busy hours.The menu is well designed, not unusually creative, but everything tastes good. The noodle soups are bursting with fresh flavours, although they could do with a little more meat in them. :-) The steak, brisket and meatball Pho is a good option if you are always meat starved, one of my favourites.The fact that this is a medium sized chain, also adds to the quality of service, and allows some room for discounts to be passed on to customers. So, a good bargain for the quality and an above average experience, overall.",
