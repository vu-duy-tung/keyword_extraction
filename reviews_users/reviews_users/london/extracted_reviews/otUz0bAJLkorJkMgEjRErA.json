    "text": "A friend and I ended up here on Friday night...wow. We sat at the bar which was great people watching...and celeb watching. My friend and I decided we wanted to try both the lobster and the burger so we ordered both and would share. Brilliantly we were then served with our meal totally halfed and ready for us. You can imagine our delight. The burger was up there with the best...with added bacon and cheese...so good...and the lobster was such a treat...with garlic butter served on the side in a little jug. I even had room for the salad and chips that come with each order. There was no menu, the guy behind the bar just told us what there was and that everything was \u00a320. It's simple but effective idea. We had so much fun and stayed for more drinks after our meal just to enjoy being there and they didn't rush us all...we were one of the last to go. Loved it!",

    "text": "I decided to go here for an impromptu lunch with a friend and ordered the combo meal this time (last time I'd just had a lobster and was a bit disappointed). This time was way better. The lobster was tender and delicious, very fresh. I loved the sauce that came with it, creamy and rich. I particularly enjoyed using the pincers to crack through my lobster tail, picking out the flesh as I drunk pink champagne (I'm a pink kind of guy). The burger was a nice filler, not the greatest burger in the world, but the lobster was really good. I was so full I couldn't fit in a free dessert! Will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "This place is way too over-hyped. Maybe we were unlucky, and our food was offered for free after a number of blunders, but we had a pretty bad experience and I won't be going back. Gourmet fast-food if there was any such thing.We arrived at 18:00 on a Monday, and were told we had to wait 40 minutes. Expected, so we went to a bar for a drink and they called us 40 minutes later. Went back and had to wait another 10-15 minutes, and there was very little space to stand. Once seated, two of us ordered lobster and one ordered the burger. The table was a bit chilly as we were right by the window, and it was very cramped (more like a table for two).The food arrived, and the burger was under-cooked. They took it back to the kitchen and returned a new burger without bacon and still a little under-cooked. They took that back and this time it came back with onion (we asked for no onion). Fourth attempt came out fine. Thankfully the owner came to our table and offered to cover the cost of our food (saving them from one star), which lead me to believe our experience was unusual. Our waitress was getting more and more impatient with us though, even though none of this was our fault.Besides the burger saga, the lobster got cold before we managed to get through the first half, and so did the butter sauce. It wasn't very tasty either, nor did the meat fall out of the shell like some other reviewers have claimed. The burger was alright, but not worth \u00a320. The salad that came with the burger had some onion in it, and the person eating it was allergic so she suffered a bit of a reaction.The macchiata came as an espresso, and when we told the waitress she just brought cold milk. When we asked for toothpicks, they said they didn't have.We weren't the only ones to complain. We overheard a neighbouring table complain about their lobster and get two replacement dishes. Another neighbour said the dessert was pretty average, definitely not made on-site and came served in a paper cup.",

    "text": "London has been cold and dreary lately. With the chilliness in the air, my heart and body started craving for something warm like noodle soup. So it was with anticipation and excitement that I set a date to head to Brixton Village to try Mama Lan with SC. As it turned out, Brixton Village isn't open on a Tuesday night and Khao Sarn was full. I suggested Roti Chai and we ended up back on the tube heading towards central London instead. As we thought about where our hungry tummies were going to eat and where we should come out, we spotted Green Park on the tube line and began to wonder if there was anything around there.I turned to SC and said that I think there is a new place called Burger & Lobster that could be there but I wasn't sure, I only remembered that it was in the west. We looked at each other and thought, should we risk it? or head straight to Roti Chai. We decided to take a risk and hopped off at Green Park. A quick confirmation on google maps revealed that we indeed came out at the right stop and walked that few minutes to our destination. Even for a Tuesday night, the place was packed but we were lucky to get a seat without waiting. Burger & Lobster don't take reservations and do note that if your entire party hasn't arrive, you won't get your table.Burger & Lobster only serves two things, burger and lobster (apologies for the pun!). Have you check out their website? It shows two tables with one having lobster and the other a burger, it was simple yet punchy and hit the mark.SC and I ordered one of each and a bottle of wine.Our order took a while to arrive but our lovely waiter, Rihanna kept us informed of the status which was great. Since it's Christmas time, we were happy to wait while catching up and sipping our wines.Our lovely lobster and burger arrived and we proceeded to wear the bibs provided to us.On the first few bites, the burger stood out more. It was a good piece of meat patty, wonderfully seasoned and delicious. It is after all a Goodman burger as this is their latest opening.We ordered our lobster grilled and it came out with a good bouncy bite to it. As we continued our meal, the freshness of the lobster starts to hit you. I was hoping for the soft sweetness of fresh lobster which was not boldly evident in the first bite, but that might be because I ordered it to be grilled instead of just steamed, I'm not sure.Looks can also be deceiving as we nearly contemplated ordering three dishes instead of two like the table next to us. Thankfully, we did not as there was a whole lot of meat in that one lobster and it took me a good steady concentration of 30 minutes to extract all that juicy meat out.The accompanying garlic butter was fragrant and not overly rich which went well with the lobster. The lobster and burgers are definitely the stars of the dishes with the salad and chips playing a side role.SC and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and the place has a great relaxed and informal atmosphere to it. I also have to make a special mention to our lovely waitress, Rihanna who only made our experience so much better. She checks on us regularly to make sure that we were good and even showed us the tanks where the lobsters were kept. This was a tip that I got from the twitter-verse, thank you!The best part of Burger & Lobster is yet to come, both dishes are priced at \u00a320! Decadence without breaking the bank, I love this place already and I can see myself coming back regularly. We need more places like this in London, places that serve delicious food at great value.Much to my surprise, a chat with Rihanna revealed that Burger & Lobster only opened its doors on Saturday so a random change of events and chance led us to dining here in its very first week. To Rihanna, thanks for taking such good care of us, the next time I am back, I am leaving a bigger tip!",

The lobster was impressive looking when it was served, but I am hesitant to give it a higher rating because the lobster could be a lot fresher. The lack of freshness was compensated by the creamy butter sauce. The burger was mediocre. For 20 pounds per dish, I would recommend trying the two lobster dishes instead. The service was really good. The waitress even offered to cut our burger as we were sharing the dishes. Overall, a good experience and worth trying!",

I like the Mayfair branch because it is not so crowded as the other outlets so getting a place is a lot easier (although still a challenge!). The lobster is cooked well sometimes and other times, depending on your luck, is not cooked enough. I think some consistency would be good! The chairs are a little too high for my liking, feels like an expensive pub. The drinks are expensive but I'm guessing this is how they get their money back. A better selection of wines would be good, to go down well with the lobster.",

    "text": "I am not always a fan of gimmicky restaurants, and while this place is a steal for lobster lovers (20 GBP for a whole one steamed with garlic butter), it's not somewhere likely to become a regular haunt for me. That said, the burger was excellent - one of the best I've had for ages - with tasty moist meat, cooked perfectly, deliciously meting cheese and salty smokey bacon. The little side salad and decent fries were a welcome addition, although I'm still not sure the whole package is worthy of the 20 quid I had to pay. The Mayfair branch's 'put your name down, we'll call you if a table becomes available' system makes for a cold wait in the current weather or a rather frustrating wander around the neighbourhood looking for a place to drink (I've heard the Soho branch offers reservations for groups). We ended up being sent away, only to find ourselves called back just as we were sitting down about to order a drink elsewhere. A few minutes later and we'd have been most annoyed to have missed our slot or had to down our drinks. Still, it all worked out and the four of us were very happy with our dinner, despite the hefty price tag for the burger. Given this is a much better deal for the crustacean lovers out there I would recommend this place if you are all ordering the lobster or the lobster roll, for the meat lovers of London beware.Side note: our Australian waiter made two of our party some of the best coffee (lattes if I recall) they had had in a while, worth asking for instead of their minimal dessert list which we didn't end up needing.",

The toasty bun was surprisingly good and crunchy. All entrees come with chips also. I was surprised by the number of people who ordered both a burger and half a lobster (I guess that's why it's called burger AND lobster - not burger OR lobster).

When you've gone to Burger & Lobster once you don't even need the waiter to tell you the options. They serve a classic grilled lobster, a lobster in a bun / brioche and of course the burger. I had to go for the grilled lobster and I did not regret it. The dish comes with fries and a side salad and it's delish! I do need to go back at least two more times to test out the other options too some day. Also, the are no reservations, so get ready to wait for your table especially if you go on a weekend. But I'd say it's well worth it ;)",

Drinks are reasonably priced. Service is friendly. Menu isn't anything surprising: lobster, burger, lobster roll, or a combo. I got the lobster roll (comes with fries and side salad). My hubs and his friend got the combo: each got 1 burger, half a lobster, side salad, fries, and pudding. Best meal we've had in London so far. Don't be shy with adding the garlic butter. \u00a0Salad isn't anything special. The fries (chips) were pretty amazing, perfectly seasoned with a fresh crispness to them. I wasn't expecting much from the pudding. They have chocolate and berry cheesecake. The chocolate has croutons (?) on top and is a nice dark/semi sweet chocolate pudding. The cheesecake has crushed graham crackers, blueberries then the pudding. Perfect. It has the full cheesecake experience without being overly rich or dense. Cheesecake should always be pudding. I hope we make it back again.",

(Me and \"the dad\" actually did this deal thing which they have when you can share but I'm going to stop confusing you..)\"Kid, a 20ball for a burger you've got to be joking. Value for money simply states this should be the time I splash out on the lobster! Plus I get to use those cracking tools which I actually have no idea how to use properly and I get to wear a little bib thing!\"Well whatever you think of the statement above I tried both so here's my verdict.Burger (Only first in line because I'm going in alphabetical order, no favouratism here!)-Decent, pretty big but it kind of has to be if you're going to charge a 20ball for it. -Good meat, will obviously fill you up.It's good but not 20 quid's worth of good.\"What an amateur this kid is, he didn't even mention the fries which come with the burger\"The fries come with whatever you order but whatever, I'll just review them now.They're very good, exactly what you expect from a good \"junky\" restaurant. Won't be disappointed.Lobster (That's right still in alphabetical order here)-You get a lot for the money which is more of a releif than anything else-Great sauce to dip in.-Cooked really well, can have it cooked grilled or steamed.Seems worth it.Fun, lively atmosphere which is nice. Not overly expensive and you get that feeling that you're having a good quality meal.No reservations, have to go to the door and in the evenings sometimes wait an hour or so.Just missing out on the five due to the fact that the quality could be a bit better (take that with a pinch of salt though, hopefully on the fries). I feel it's great value and a fun little lunch/evening idea.\"I'm a fan\"",

    "text": "Now Burger & Lobster, the name is a give away, you can either order a burger, or yep, you guessed it, a lobster; so no messing around here you go for one or the other.We headed to the Mayfair branch as we thought there would be a better chance of getting a table. we arrived and asked for a table of four; I was expecting a half hour wait at least, but the food Gods were shining down on us, a group of four hadn't turned up and the front of house man said \"I've tried ringing them three times, they have had their chance, it's yours\". Wow, we were seated straight away, bonus, and pretty unheard of at Burger and Lobster.We took our seats and the waitress explained how things worked and the prices, everything is \u00a320, all of which comes with a side order of fries and salad. Whilst we decided which option to go for, we ordered a round of drinks. Now, there is a menu for this as they offer a lot of choice, but I made my mind up quick sharp as I spotted a craft beer that I've been wanting to try for a long time. The beer in question was Flying Dogs Brewery's Snake Dog IPA, and for \u00a35.25 it is a lot of money for a 335ml can of beer, but it's a beauty of a beer and I happily paid for two more after I tasted the first. The perfectly smooth IPA, slithers down the throat (see what I did there) and has a really big hoppy flavour with a hint of citrus and malt, a fantastic beer.After I snapped out of my beer trance, the was the small matter of deciding what food to have, and I nearly ordered the lobster. You may be shocked, but I haven't had any for ages and it looked so tasty. The other three all went for lobster, but after much deliberation, I just couldn't, I HAD to try the burger, with added bacon of course.The food came out and all of our jaws dropped. Wow, the lobsters looked amazing and the burger, well, just looked damn sexy, cheese oozing out and the bacon and pickle poking out the sides, oh yes!The 8oz patty was cooked to perfection; medium rare and seasoned just right. It had a really good meaty flavour, the bacon wasn't too salty and complimented the patty beautifully, the lettuce and the pickle provided the crunch and freshness and the bun held up nicely even after soaking all those lovely juices up. One of the better burgers I have had in London. The fries and side salad were good, but played second fiddle to the main event. Yes the burger is expensive at \u00a320, but I'd say it's worth it, especially with your sides included.As the lobster goes, it got a huge claws up from our table. The steamed option came up trumps, with the grilled, smoke kissed option coming closely up the rear. We all enjoyed the service, so friendly and very professional, and made our Burger & Lobster experience very enjoyable, so if you haven't yet experienced Burger & Lobster yet, you should. We will definitely be heading back, lobster roll, your cards are marked.",

I would have a hard time thinking a standard sized lobster roll would be a good value. The burger was definitely good, but nothing that knocked my socks off. My friend got the lobster, and it was grilled perfectly. Fries were evenly cooked, but nothing special either. I had the Gran Capitan cocktail, and it was really sweet. At 10 quid for about 6oz, it's definitely not worth it. They have two beers on tap, I believe. Both were good and typically priced. Staff is friendly, but otherwise pretty standard. Overall, this is a pretty average place, but with higher than average prices. The menu is really limited. There's not even an option for one person to sample both burger and lobster. This place should be called \"Burger OR Lobster, but don't bother with Burger since it's a ripoff\"",

    "text": "Why waste time printing menus when you only have 3 items right? I wonder why no other places have done this yet?!?For those of you who don't know how this place works, they only offer 3 food items:BurgerSteamed LobsterLobster RollAny of the above for 20GBP. Analysis of the Menu: Burger:I balked at paying 20GPB ($32USD) for a burger especially when there is nothing extraordinary about it (i.e. made with kobe beef or prime rib or garnished with duck confitt, lamb bacon or foie gras or anything insane or posh toppings). So that was an instant scratch in my mind. Lobster(s)The server mentioned that the standard weight for the lobster were about 1-1.5 pound range and would come steamed or chilled with lemon and drawn butter. This selection boasts the best value for money as it's not too uncommon to pay $50+ for a lobster dinner.If you manage to take a look at the tanks in the back, you will see the heavyweight monsters you can select from should you want to upgrade from the standard meal. \u00a0I didn't want to get messy to this was a scratch for me as well. Lobster Roll:This caught my eyes since I am a sucker for an awesome lobster roll. Once again I balked at the price, at first look I was a little discerned as the New England roll was cut into a pouch versus like a hot dog roll like I am used to. This gave the illusion that there was not much inside it. Thankfully looks were deceiving in this case. I kept on picking at the overflow of lobster meat but the sandwich kept on spewing! I swear the managed to stuff a whole lobster in the roll!. The evidence was apparent I saw whole claw meat as well as bits of the rest of the lobster carcass.. \u00a0Needless to say I was impressed... Drinks:The cocktail list is very impressive for those who enjoy fu-fu drinks. I on the other hand prefer beer and was really disappointed at the very limited selection of draft beer. However, I was very surprised to see Asahi on tap here, I think its the only place in Greater London that I've seen to date. \u00a0While impressed at that, it does not take away from the lack of selection here; So for that my friends I'd have to take away a star.All in all I was a great dining experience. This place seems to be a new London hot spot so I would suggest making reservations...Cheers!",

I had the classic and I was blown away. Another time I had the California, which comes inside a lettuce head ( no bun ) which is a nice Lo carb alternative. The best thing about this place and I cannot stress it enough, is the staff. You feel so welcome here. You are treated like a friend. Our host was so nice to us.

    "text": "I knew about Burger and Lobster from a few different sources, as a guy at work raved about it and the missus has really wanted to go for a while. I thought I knew what it was - you know, a choice of a burger or lobster, but when it came down to it I got a little confused. Because well... define \"salad\". What sort of salad? What sort of dressing? Are the fries chunky or thin? Can I choose a sauce? All this and more was what I was expecting on a menu, but alas there is no food menu, just a spiel recited by a waitress. But regardless of that, this surpassed all expectation. Having had lobster before, and not fancy trying to crack into one at the time, I opted for the lobster roll (let's face it, the burger seemed like a cop-out). It was sublime. Tonnes of tasty lobster meat packed into some of the finest brioche I've ever had. The missus somehow knew to order some garlic butter with it and that was just amazing - even the salad was good, dressed in simple oil and vinegar, but was a perfect accompaniment. The only lobster roll I can compare this to is from Bob's Lobsters, but I think this was much better.It would have managed to get five stars, but I didn't like that a party of four was turfed out of a table that they tried to sit at because it was done up for six and the manager wouldn't let them occupy a table \"that large\" because they might have a bigger group come in later that needed it. The table was empty the entire time I was there, and I never expect to see that sort of disrespect to customers, in fact had they been loud mouth city boys who'd spend a load on booze like some of the other tables nearby then I doubt it would have happened. But instead these were Asian tourists and so instead they got the boot. I hope they showed the guy a two finger salute and went somewhere else.",

I had the lobster and he had the burger (he's not a fan of lobster), both were great. I really enjoyed it and couldn't wait to go back. We went again but to a different branch and I must admit I didn't enjoy it as much, perhaps the atmosphere wasn't as good, but it hasn't put me off and next time I think I'll try the lobster roll.",

When we arrived, they said to us that we have to wait about 1 hours due to it was so incredible busy.

For 20 pounds, it was hard to justify eating a burger when the alternative options were lobster, so my girlfriend and I ordered a grilled lobster and a lobster roll. As you can see in many of the pictures, the meal comes with a nice side salad and a ton of fries. Portion-wise, it was enough to fill us both up.The grilled lobster was extremely fresh and delicious. However, the special thing about the lobster is not its freshness but that it is relatively inexpensive for an entire lobster! Another key aspect of the meal is the garlic butter, which really added a nice flavor to the lobster. Even though the lobster is not unique to the area, this was a terrific deal.The lobster roll was also delicious. The buns were nicely buttered up and toasted. There was also a generous amount of lobster in the roll. The roll here was definitely as good as any other I have had.After having tried this place, I can understand why this is such a popular restaurant in London. There is an energetic vibe to the place for the younger crowd and the business crowd.",

    "text": "I love lobster, so going to this place is pretty much a PILGRIMAGE for me. It really is that epic because I keep getting things popping up, and then i have to cancel and them it makes me want it more. So the premise is simple, the place serves whole lobster, lobster roll and a burger. All for the wonderful price of \u00a320. (Although 20 for a burger is pretty extortionate.) Had to wait around 30 minutes for a table, but well worth it, the bar was very good and tbh, for the prices, this is where they get their major profits from. Much to a friend's delight, they serve so many different whiskeys, because when you're living up in burger and lobster, you go the whole lobster hog. I opted for a sloe gin and lemonade. I swear they just sit you there so you can see the amazing massive lobster plates waft past and it's just either genius or just cruel. As my last few reviews have shown, I am pretty much a old chinese lady inside so steamed lobster, it was. with lemon butter. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. The lobster was meaty and so sweet and just gaaahhhh....d. Yeah. Just go. Save up \u00a340, arrive early, get some drinks in, eat, cross off bucket list. Go. Tip: Go with less people: pick people who will appreciate this. who the hell likes going with friends that hate seafood. (i know there is burger but they'll spend the whole night grimacing at the lobsters beautiful face, and its it's ever between lobster and friend. always choose lobster.)",

    "text": "The concept is simple: You are offered a choice of three items. You can get a burger, a lobster roll, or a lobster. They are each \u00a320. (Although there are bigger lobsters you can get for \u00a330, or even bigger lobsters for more if you so choose.) I'd been dying to try this place for awhile. It sounds amazing. So, while trying to figure out where to have dinner the night of our Olympic tickets, I suggested here. It was 6:45, and there was already an hour wait (for two people), so we put our name down (they call you when your table is ready!) and went around the corner (or several corners) to a nearby pub to wait.Anyway, we get a call, we head back, stop at the bar for drinks while they get things ready for us. The wine list is a bit small, but they have a nice selection of things, and we went with a nice Chablis to pair with lobster. They bring us to our table, and our trendy mustachioed server came up to us to offer us our options. I was dying to try the lobster roll (and the burger, just to try it), so I ordered that, and the other half got the lobster. Well our food came. Honestly, I was quite disappointed. The lobster roll was miniscule compared to the lobster that came out. It was incredibly tasty. The flavors were good, but why is the amount of lobster not the same? The chips and salad were amazing. Everything was so tasty. Luckily, my other half took a bit of pity on me and gave me a few bites of his lobster. (Not many, but a few). The lobster was fantastic. He was in love with it, claiming it was the best lobster he'd had. And for \u00a320, that's saying something. I ended up getting dessert. Cheesecake mousse with strawberry jelly and cookie crumbles. Very tasty! The two people at the table next to us got one of each. They didn't finish everything, but the burger looked amazing. I want to try it, but I don't want to be jealous of the lobster, so I think I've managed to convince the other half to go halfsies on the burger and the lobster next time (although he said we may have to order the slightly larger lobster). I did casually mention to the server about the slight disappointment in the amount of lobster meat in the lobster roll, and he said that apparently everything is proportionately made for the best flavor. More lobster meat would ruin the taste. My solution? Make EVERYTHING slightly larger. It probably won't happen.Unless you're really not hungry, and only want a little bit of lobster, don't order the lobster roll here ever. Seriously. The lobster is a way better deal. The lobster roll may be (slightly) tastier, but not for the sheer amount of lobster you get with the lobster! Even with my slight disappointment, I'm still giving this place a full five stars, just for the sheer enjoyment of the place. It was fun, and totally worth the wait!",

    "text": "Burger and Lobster is a current cultural phenomenon in London. Packed on weeknights, weekends, and a place to enjoy a meal with your mates or some dates. It's pricey and affordable at the same time, and fits into that little bit of luxury and fun niche that today's world needs. 3 fantastic menu items, fun drinks, and a great atmosphere.There's only 3 items on the menu. Burger, Lobster, or Lobster Roll? Burger for me! This burger's reputation preceded it so it has a lot to live up to. A 10 ounce patty of premium beef, black + white seed sesame bun, tomato, cheese, bacon, shredded lettuce, and red onion. My first impression upon receiving my burger was that it really looked the part. I was excited to take my first bite, but upon picking it up, I noticed that it was a bit hard to manage. I bit in and had a very satisfying bite of tender + juicy beef and crispy bacon. The shredded lettuce, great grind on the beef, and soft bun did wonders for the texture. The crispy bacon, sliced red onion, and rest of the flavors on the burger were great as well. I had trouble determining if there was a house sauce on top of the burger with all of the other flavors going on. I noticed I was given ketchup and mayo with the burger, however the original flavors of the burgers were enjoyable enough to need no further. My last note on taste is that the pickles were a bit sweet and I think more vinegary pickles usually pair better with beef.While the burger was great, it was too big to make it as enjoyable as it could have been. I'm not sure if Burger and Lobster is trying to offer value against the Lobster options by making the burger as big as possible, but in this case it was too much. I have found the burger sweet spot is between 5-8 ounces of beef. With all of the toppings including the thick slice of tomato (which I'd recommend taking off) the burger was just a bit too big. Size cannot take away from flavor, but if this thing were scaled down it might be that much more enjoyable... and be sitting with the best in London. Last of all, Burger and Lobster's fries might be the best in London and that in its own right is worth a visit.",

    "text": "Besides the wacky reservation policy of showing up 2 hours before your desired dining time on a weeknight and being told that there is no chance, and that we should have come around 4-5pm (sorry, I don't live or work around here so really don't want to hang around for 4 hours) or that we should have called ahead to learn the 'system' (sorry, you don't take reservation so why would I call ahead?) this is a truly great addition to the London restaurant scene, and I wish I thought of it myself! Their explanation for the reservation system was that it was a 'trendy' thing to do, which is also disappointing, seriously? But I guess it makes sense as there is only one course, and when you're selling lobsters at \u00a320 each, you need to rotate tables quickly and don't have the luxury of holding a table for 45 minutes before the reserved party shows up, so I get it.Basically there is no menu, and there are three things on the menu: Burgers (with cheese or bacon, how you like), lobster, and a lobster roll, all at \u00a320, with the addition of catch-of-the-day lobsters that range from 2 - 8 lbs. The most expensive one when we went was \u00a3134.00, and the claws were about the size of a toddler, true incredible specimens. All dishes come with a portion of fries and salad per person (both perfectly executed and delish), and there are two desserts, a cheesecake or chocolate mouse with crumble, in addition to an extensive wine, beer and cocktail menu.Everything was excellent, but the lobster rolls were a tad disappointing as I am used to seeing the huge, over stuffed variety, and these ones at \u00a320 were on the measly side. Tasty, but out of scale compared to the rest of the food. Overall, the place was bumpin', the food was as good as it gets (they better get it right as there is no room for error with the highly limited menu), and it is nice to have this in your back pocket for a nice dinner when you're not prepared weeks in advance for a reservation. Oh, and the bibs are classic. I will definitely be coming back, sooner rather than later.",

However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. The food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well.

She explained the menu and took our drink orders before coming back to take care of our food orders too. All over in a flash, without any unnecessary waiting. Everything arrived quickly.

Not particularly large by any standards but generous enough for London and at \u00a320 each I was silently sending a prayer out to all those who order \u00a320 burgers (I'm not judging you but I'm glad I'm not you.)My only complaint is that the seating isn't very comfortable. High bar stools made it awkward, especially given the hands on nature of almost everything on the menu. Can't comment on the cocktails I'm afraid as I didn't want to bankrupt myself. All in all a great experience but not necessarily one I'd want to repeat. Another one off my London foodie bucket list though!N.B.

    "text": "I've been meaning to try out Burger & Lobster for a while now. I've only been stymied by the price - I know \u00a320 for a whole lobster is a good deal, but I knew I'd not be up for all the work of getting the meat out of the shell, so it seemed a bit steep for a cold lobster roll. But finally I could take it no more and succumbed. We were going to a nearby hotel for a gala movie screening (as you do) so we were quite early - 5.15pm - and got a table right away. When we left an hour later, there was a small queue.I've only had lobster on cruise ships, which is by all accounts, a rubbery affair. Still tasty, but nothing to write home about. I've had a lovely lobster roll from B.O.B.'s Lobster in the past but not a lot of experience with lobster in general. So I wasn't too sure what to expect.I had a bit of a strop when my husband looked puzzled about the lack of a menu. I explained it to him and he was still just, well, puzzled. Finally the much more patient waitress came to help the table next to us and he heard her spiel and the penny dropped. We both ordered lobster rolls with a coke.The food came quickly, with chips, salad, the lobster roll, and (not nearly enough) garlic butter. The garlic butter was really, really nice and both of us were dipping our chips into it. Why have I never put butter on chips before!? Oh yeah, the hope to live to 40.The lobster was so soft, without a strong taste one way or the other. The brioche was the star of the sandwich, buttery and savoury and more like a big slice of Texas toast than a bun (that is, no bun-like crust messing it all up, except at the edges). Neither of us could finish our rolls, and I barely made a dent in the fries either.The not-so-great bits were that the fries were oversalted, and I had shell in my roll and my husband had some cartilage in his. As tasty as it was, I still maintain that it's a bit expensive - our meal with the 2 cokes was over \u00a350, as they do put a 12.5% service charge on. The service was fine and the waitress deserved it but it just makes for a bit of sticker shock. It's not that it's overpriced as such, just that lobster is expensive, so it will have to remain a special treat (and my arteries will thank me!)",

We got to taking about the restaurant and its origins. This is the original location of burger and lobster so if you want to see where it all began, come here. I ordered the steamed (also available in grilled) half lobster and it came with fries and a small salad. The butter sauce was amazing and should be drizzled on everything. Their concept is quite simple which explains their huge success and opening off their New York location. Given its only over the pond, if there isn't demand the brand would fail. Luckily they did things right and I'm looking forward to coming back again to this chain. Don't worry about getting down and dirty. Thats how you should be eating seafood. There's nothing more romantic than cracking the shell off a lobster so man up and dig in. Everyone else is doing it. I left with a lighter wallet (London is a very expensive city) but the food was great and I would so it again. The waiter was kind enough to give me an extra bib and an Oyster card sleeve to take home with me. It was his third day on the job. Highly recommended.",

Calamari came as a smaller dish than I expected but the flavors we're great. Crunchy and seasoned properly, the dish came with a lemon aioli and marinara sauce. The calamari itself had a small kick to it that gave dipping it in the sauces a refreshing taste. Next was the Lobster slider. Fries, a salad, the lobster roll and a sauce container of garlic butter. Fries were seasoned and plentiful. The salad was a spring mix with red onion. The dressing was a balsamic vinegar and oil. It was them sprinkled with parmesan. The lobster roll was served on a butter toasted brioche toll. A moderate amount of lobster salad in it. The roll itself was crunchy and the lobster salad was creamy and delicious. The salad left me wanting more and the fries were more than enough to complete the meal. I dipped the lobster roll in the garlic butter and it was magical. Last as a drink I got a Mandarin, pineapple, and lime drink. A lot of ice and not a lot of juice. For \u00a35 , it should have had less ice and more drink. Aside from that I would recommend this place to others.",

The fries are crispy. \u00a0The meal was very filling, although it doesn't initially look that way.",

We were lucky to be there during the national lobster day, which means that if we buy a whole giant lobster, we get a free bottle of prosecco and unlimited sides of salad and fries.The 1.7kg lobster ran me 85 British pounds. It was indeed huge and the quality was amazing. We got half grilled and half boiled lobster. The lobster comes with unlimited garlic butter sauce. The lobster was fresh and the flesh was very firm and sweet. Between the 2 types of cooking method, I definitely preferred the boiled but both were delicious.The service here is alright. Everyone is super nice but it's extremely busy so it's hard to get somebody's attention at times. I recommend arriving around opening time to minimize the wait time as the wait can get really long.",

We opted to sit at the bar to avoid the 15 minute wait for a table. Our first task was ordering cocktails. I chose the BL Burger Bellini (\u00a39), which had strawberry, hibiscus, lemon, and fizz. A lovely drink even in the dead of early winter. My BF got the B&L does Gin & tonic (\u00a39), a twist on a classic gin and tonic with peach, grapefruit, and cucumber tonic. We decided to get the B&L combo, which is a 1.26 lb lobster and a 5 oz burger for \u00a336. If you're going to come to Burger & Lobster, how can you not order the two quintessential menu items that this restaurant specializes in? We chose the lobster to be grilled. It's also served with a salad and chips (French fries for us Americans). Both the burger and the lobster were phenomenal. Cooked to perfection, oozing with juices and melted butter. It was like a symphony exploded into song in my mouth. So mouth-wateringly delicious. Chatting a bit with our server/bartender, we found out that this is actually a small global chain. There are even a couple of locations in NYC. They get their beef from a farm in Nebraska, and the lobster is sourced from Nova Scotia. Excellent food and great service. We will have to try the ones in NYC next!",

Burger and Lobster is a chain that started in 2011 with 4 schoolmates on a rooftop in London wanted to create a place that specialized in 1-2 main ingredients. In a small Irish Pub in Mayfair is where the first Burger and Lobster was started. Now it has expanded to many locations worldwide. London has 9 locations. The menu is simple: 1. Starter -Croquette, calamari, prawn, or dip. 2. Pick a main course (comes with chips and salad) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lobster (1 lb vs. 1.5 lb vs. Chili)  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Roll - Singapore or Original  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Burger - Original, California, or Lobster  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Combo (5 oz Burger and 1 lb. Lobster ) \u00a03. Dessert- Cheesecake, brownie, or Sundae. *Get a cocktail- they are quiet good. The quality of the food is excellent, especially for a chain restaurant. Simple and delicious. Also, big portions. Ricky had to help me finish my meal. \u00a0Recommend for a solid lunch option.",

Probably not the most touristy thing to do (like, why didn't we try more restaurants?!) but it was SO GOOD we just couldn't help it!We ended up there our first night in London because it had good reviews and was within walking distance of The Ritz, where we stayed. We sat at the bar because it was 5pm & convenient, but then learned that was the easiest place to get in for dinner. (There were lines out the door for tables the other two times we came in. Pro tip: get there before 5 to beat the work crowd; have a drink or two at the bar and then order dinner.)The first time, I ordered a lobster roll; the second time I had a burger (just to try it--DELICIOUS); and then I the last time I had another lobster roll. For me, I would probably go for the lobster roll because that's a little harder to get than a good cheeseburger where I live. BUT, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, really.I wish I remembered our bartender's name from the first night; he made THE BEST old fashioneds and whiskey sours. The other ones we had weren't bad, but the first guy really finessed the drinks, and we could tell.UGH, my mouth is watering just thinking about this place...",

Nothing good nor bad - just a point of information. I'm used to it for crawfish in LA and even GA - they deep but I wonder if they have any complaints about the seasoning or taste of the seafood. Like the Vietnamese on the Westbank of New Orleans cook their shellfish like a true Louisianian - all spicy and muah. This was priced higher than I anticipated and wouldn't pay for what I had if I had to do it again. People please KNOW: I took a train ride from the airport. Black car to Buckingham. Walked from Buckingham to this location all with backpacks on our backs and couldn't be allowed to sit and wait for 20 minutes until they officially opened. Ok whatever, we waited at a coffee shop found two blocks over, tried to get a massage across the street from the restaurant and was told no one was on duty but they could get me tomorrow....Bestie said it was for men not for me. lolzEither way, returned 10 minutes after opening and the place was packed. Take it for what you need it to be. Again, I'm butt hurt the grill was on the fritz and no one seemed bothered by it all.",

It's a chain, I famously rant about chains and try my best to stick to independents when I'm not with people who insist on ruddy Nando's (ugh!) and although the burgers are a little pricier to match the lobster I presume, the lobster is actually pretty cheap by lobster-y standard, and although I have had some amazing lobster in the past, this wasn't half bad at all. I plumped for the lobster burger, because I also love meat, and Brie and truffle, so all of those packed in with some nicely seasoned chips was pretty good.

    "text": "The year was 1992. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) takes Charlie Simms out to dinner to an upscale restaurant in New York (in the movie \"Scent of a woman\"). The burger cost $24. Who pays so much for a burger and where on earth do you get such expensive burgers ?Fast forward twenty years. The answer is \"Burger and Lobster\". This joint has been open for barely a couple of months I hear and is already a rage. I first attempted to visit last Thursday for dinner. My friend advised me to get there by six. What ! Anybody has dinner that early ? Enough people actually. When I reached at 6:15, there was already a two hour wait. Thankfully I slipped into the an extra chair with my friend as we converted a table for two to a three. If its a small group (four or less) and you want o be seated immediately, get here by six. If you are part of a larger group, then get here even earlier. They don't take reservations. The menu was limited. It's either burger, or lobster or lobster roll. They all cost the same ... \u00a320. I went for the burger. It comes with cheese and bacon, if you so wish and one portion of chips and salad. You can ask for as many of the sides as you want for no extra cost. B&L have a very streamlined operational process and the food arrived very quickly (even before I got the drink). The burger was very big. The patty was made of tender, delicious meat and excellently cooked. The bacon was not too crisp and not too soggy, just perfect. It was more than enough to fill one person. The burger was great, but was it worth \u00a320. I still wasn't sure ... and the crowd that we were seeing waiting at the bar ... was the burger the reason for this rage ? Must be the lobster, we decided. So I dropped in for a late lunch (2:15) two days later. It was crowded again, though slightly less so. At lunch they allow smaller groups to sit and order food from the bar, which is what I did ... The full lobster this time ... With molten lemon and garlic butter. The lobster was served steamed and cut open (they do provide a plier for the show). It was just divine. I was able to access parts of the animal which I have never been able to taste before (since its usually so difficult to handle). The meat was easy to scoop out and lobster to me has rarely tasted better. B&L won a promotion to 5 stars from 4 in my eyes. The chips here are not the very best (i.e, not as good as the ones at Hawksmoor), but pretty well done nevertheless. I finished the salad on both occasions ... so there isn't anything left to say about that except that it was good (the dressing was lovely). B&L have their drinks classified as being better with burger or lobster. But i ignored their classification and ordered the Gin fizz on my first visit. It's a cocktail that's not very common even in bar menus, let alone at restaurants. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had made it well. The next time I went for the Clarges Buck, a concoction made of Chivas Regal whiskey and several different kinds of fruit juices and syrups. It was tasty. The cocktails were priced at a reasonable \u00a38-\u00a39 range. For desserts you can get either the chocolate mocha mousse or the lemon mousse. I haven't tried them yet. One drink and food ends up costing around \u00a332 here, which isn't very high. Coming here for a 6pm dinner might be difficult but I can foresee several Saturday lunches (they are closed on Sundays) here for me.",

However the impression that lasts is the service and experience and the manager gave us probably the snootiest and rudest service we have ever experienced. A promise for a table 2 hour later turned out to be 3 hours and \"Actually I have no idea when you will get a table\". At his advice we waited at the bar and ordered our food so we could get started on our dinner so he decided without checking with us that we were no longer waiting for a table. His wait staff spilled hot butter all over our jacket which was fine as she was so apologetic, but he had no apology or offer to clean the jacket; instead told her off for trying to offer us some chips (afterall we had been waiting for 3 hours). \u00a0 It was interesting to try but they better clean up their service else it's going downhill very quickly. \u00a0Wake up call: the no reservations policy doesn't work for a restaurant serving lobsters where people can take a long time to chew through. Burgers not worth having - go to Goodmans instead, nearly half the price and much better chips. How can the sister restaurant of Goodmans get it so wrong? \u00a0So far 8 of our friends have gone on 4 different occasions and we've agreed it's not worth the chaos and rude service.",

Don't let this get you down though. Because they only make 2 things, you better bet those 2 things are cooked to PERFECTION!! I ordered the burger. I have never had a burger that was so juicy and flavorful!! It came on a nice warm bun with delicious grilled onions, lettuce mix, and tomatoes!! Along with that it came with a side of skinny fries (or should I say chips), which were seasoned perfectly! I also believe it came with a small side salad, which amazingly was very delicious as well. My dad ordered the lobster, which was also juicy and melted in your mouth! Not only was the food scrumptious, but the service was pretty fabulous as well. Our server was very attentive and even gave us yanks some suggestions of what to do and see while in London. If you decide to go here I would suggest making a reservation, as this location is small and very popular. If you have to wait it is worth the wait!!",

    "text": "Last night I found myself heading over to the recently opened Burger & Lobster, to see what the hype and queues were all about. From the team behind Goodman's Steakhouse (supposedly one of the best steaks in London), they've certainly stuck by the rules of keeping things simple. There's no food menu as such, except what has been scrawled on the chalk board, Burger or Lobster. Beef burger, whole lobster, or a lobster roll; all served with fries and salad for \u00a320 a pop. For me, there was only one thing to order, and that was the Lobster. Grilled and served with a side of lemon-garlic butter. But for my friend, a self confessed lobster virgin, as he wasn't a fan of crab nor the idea of extracting his supper from the shells, opted for the Beef burger. With our Prosecco and delicious cocktail of Gin, Cucumber and Chamomile syrup in hand, our waiter swiftly brought out our meals on silver trays. My lobster definitely looked impressive. Taste-wise, the meat was sweet and perfectly grilled with a firm chunky texture. However, the accompanying lemon-garlic butter was lacking the lemon tang or the garlic flavour, and it probably could have done with a bit of salt, and a dash of tabasco sauce. My friends burger just looked OK, and probably not worth the money compared with the whole meaty lobster I had in front of me. I'm pretty sure he would have had food envy! Overall, the atmosphere was buzzy, and service was fairly swift once you get through the door, but I'm sitting on the fence with this, and still working out what the hype is about if I'm honest. Yes, it's definitely good value by London standards, especially for a whole lobster, but for the over-priced burger, the lobster roll (which I didn't see anyone eating and understand it's just the claw), and the slight attitude you get from the hostess at the door holding all the power via a clipboard, I'm not sure it's really worth the 1.5 hour wait?!

Ever.The main issue is the wait outside. However, the last time I did go I was seated in less than 1 minute. This really must be a record for the place.If you're going in a small group 3-4 people and everyone shows up on time its great, perfect place for couples but not so for a first date!Absolutely love the place!",

    "text": "Pics@Chopstix2Steakniveschopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 London has been cold and dreary lately. With the chilliness in the air, my heart and body started craving for something warm like noodle soup. So it was with anticipation and excitement that I set a date to head to Brixton Village to try Mama Lan with SC. As it turned out, Brixton Village isn't open on a Tuesday night and Khao Sarn was full. I suggested Roti Chai and we ended up back on the tube heading towards central London instead. As we thought about where our hungry tummies were going to eat and where we should come out, we spotted Green Park on the tube line and began to wonder if there was anything around there. I turned to SC and said that I think there is a new place called Burger & Lobster that could be there but I wasn't sure, I only remembered that it was in the west. We looked at each other and thought, should we risk it? or head straight to Roti Chai. We decided to take a risk and hopped off at Green Park. A quick confirmation on google maps revealed that we indeed came out at the right stop and walked that few minutes to our destination. Even for a Tuesday night, the place was packed but we were lucky to get a seat without waiting. Burger & Lobster don't take reservations and do note that if your entire party hasn't arrive, you won't get your table. Burger & Lobster only serves two things, burger and lobster (apologies for the pun!). Have you check out their website? It shows two tables with one having lobster and the other a burger, it was simple yet punchy and hit the mark. SC and I ordered one of each and a bottle of wine. Our order took a while to arrive but our lovely waiter, Rihanna kept us informed of the status which was great. Since it's Christmas time, we were happy to wait while catching up and sipping our wines. Our lovely lobster and burger arrived and we proceeded to wear the bibs provided to us. On the first few bites, the burger stood out more. It was a good piece of meat patty, wonderfully seasoned and delicious. It is after all a Goodman burger as this is their latest opening. We ordered our lobster grilled and it came out with a good bouncy bite to it. As we continued our meal, the freshness of the lobster starts to hit you. I was hoping for the soft sweetness of fresh lobster which was not boldly evident in the first bite, but that might be because I ordered it to be grilled instead of just steamed, I'm not sure. Looks can also be deceiving as we nearly contemplated ordering three dishes instead of two like the table next to us. Thankfully, we did not as there was a whole lot of meat in that one lobster and it took me a good steady concentration of 30 minutes to extract all that juicy meat out. The accompanying garlic butter was fragrant and not overly rich which went well with the lobster. The lobster and burgers are definitely the stars of the dishes with the salad and chips playing a side role. SC and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and the place has a great relaxed and informal atmosphere to it. I also have to make a special mention to our lovely waitress, Rihanna who only made our experience so much better. She checks on us regularly to make sure that we were good and even showed us the tanks where the lobsters were kept. This was a tip that I got from the twitter-verse, thank you! The best part of Burger & Lobster is yet to come, both dishes are priced at \u00a320! Decadence without breaking the bank, I love this place already and I can see myself coming back regularly. We need more places like this in London, places that serve delicious food at great value. Much to my surprise, a chat with Rihanna revealed that Burger & Lobster only opened its doors on Saturday so a random change of events and chance led us to dining here in its very first week. To Rihanna, thanks for taking such good care of us, the next time I am back, I am leaving a bigger tip!",

    "text": "It would be delightful to start this review saying \"Well, I've eaten a lot of lobster in my time and frankly my dear, this is the best\". \u00a0Sadly I haven't. \u00a0I've eaten it twice. \u00a0The first time was at Cote for my 25th birthday. \u00a0This was the second. \u00a0Unfortunately, both times hammered home the fact that I have expensive tastes. \u00a0If only I hated it. \u00a0If only I hated champagne and caviar. \u00a0I really need to get a new job.But here come Burger & Lobster to the rescue, catering to the unwashed masses by offering an entire lobster for \u00a320. \u00a0They also offer a burger but who'd choose that? \u00a0Quite a few people, apparently, and bizarrely. \u00a0I saw several wafting past, and other reviewers have stated that they're delicious. \u00a0I'm sure they are, but you can get lovely burgers all over town for less than half the price so why on earth you'd queue for three hours and pay \u00a320 for that, I do not know.It isn't actually as straightforward as \"lobster or burger\". \u00a0There's also a lobster roll, which I presume is aimed at prissy people who don't like getting their fingers dirty. \u00a0Foolish, since that's half the fun. If you go for the obvious choice, then you can choose between the 700g lobster for \u00a320, or 900g for \u00a330, or a table-sized beast for \u00a380 that can apparently be shared between four people. We were in fact in a group of four but being possessive types, and knowing it would inspire an out-and-out catfight over the claws, we opted for our own. \u00a0You can then have it either steamed and grilled, or just steamed; and plain clarified butter, or butter with garlic and herbs. \u00a0I can't imagine any combination would disappoint. \u00a0My steamed lobster, with garlic and herb butter, was exquisite, and served with perfectly crunchy fries and a deliciously dressed salad. \u00a0Considering it was the smaller of the two individual sizes, I also felt on the pleasant side of too full afterwards, and I didn't even indulge in a pudding.The service was outstanding, both from our charming, friendly waitress and the very funny waiter on the door who had to contend with legions of hungry Londoners desperate to get a place on the all-important list. \u00a0Yes, you should get there several hours in advance. \u00a0Yes, you will queue regardless. \u00a0Yes, there are plenty of pubs around the corner where you can go for a pint or three to pass the time. \u00a0And yes, you should definitely do that; the drinks here are overpriced to make up for the relatively inexpensive seafood. \u00a0The house wine is \u00a322. \u00a0When the cheapest plonk on the menu costs more than a bloody lobster, you know the world's gone mad.",

    "text": "I finally made it. I have been to exclusive London clubs, I have been to expensive London restaurants, but I have never felt a place to be so close and yet so far away from me. The monstrous waiting times (my first attempt at going was cut short when the lady at the door told us we'd have to go back 3 hours later - and that was at 8pm) and the fact that I have a full-time job meant that I would probably have to wait for weeks, maybe months, until I'd make it.Patience is a great virtue though, and so is willpower. Armed with these, and a good friend, we went, we put our names down, and headed to the pub. We were told we'd have to wait for at least an hour, so after two hours and two glasses of wine had passed without receiving the telephone call we were so desperate to get, we took our chances and headed over. Luckily, our table was just getting prepared for us, so we sat down straight away. There is no food menu; just one for drinks, with a good selection of cocktails, spirits and beers, and a rather limited selection of wines. I was a bit disappointed with the small choice we were given for wine, especially given Goodman's amazing wine list. You can only famously get 3 things once you're in - burger, lobster or lobster roll. We went for a lobster roll and cheeseburger, split in half. They were great. Good food makes me happy. I was happy once I started eating. The food also arrived very quickly, which kind of made up for the two hours wait. The burger was fantastic, although my bun was a little bit crunchy and I would have preferred it softer. The lobster roll was delicious and highly recommended. Looking back, I'd say go for the lobster or lobster roll. They feel a little bit more 'special', plus you can get good burgers in many places around London, with about a quarter of the waiting time.I really, really wish I could have given this place 5 stars. I WANTED to give this place 5 stars. However, despite the food (and atmosphere) being fantastic, waiting for two hours when we were diplomatically told 'at least one' was a bit frustrating. What was more frustrating, however, was that despite the service being excellent and our waitress being very friendly, we got the feeling we had to get the hell out of there as soon as we finished our meals or else we'd be getting kicked out. Pushy yet polite, our waitress gave us the dessert options and when we said we didn't want any she brought us the bill because our table was about to be given away. This meant we spent two hours waiting for one hour of dining, which was not disastrous but it made the experience feel a little bit less special, which is a shame. Was it worth the wait though? Definitely? Would I go again? Of course, but I'd give it another week. I need to hit the gym now.",

We were told it would be a half hour wait for a table. So we said we were willing to sit at the bar. When a table opened up 5 minutes later we asked if we could move to it (there was no one else waiting for a table). After a lot of huffing and eye rolling from the hostess, she finally let us move. We had small children with us, so why she was so shocked we would rather sit at a table rather than the bar was strange. We especially wanted to move from the bar after the staff behind the bar ignored us at first, then got irritated that we asked for a menu (not knowing they didn't have one), only to have them chastise us for our drink order. This place is just not worth the bother.",

    "text": "Nice concept. We arrived before six, so we were seated immediately. But it did start to fill up quite quickly so the no reservations policy might be quite irritating for later diners (especially considering the location i.e. quite dead).My dining partner and i both opted for the lobster roll. The Three dishes (whole lobster, burger or lobster roll) are all accompanied by fries and salad for \u00a320. The cocktail was weak. The fries had a human hair in them (not good). We did not bring this to their attention though.The salad was missing lettuce. I do feel that certain salad leaves are very strong tasting and need the plain crispness of lettuce to mellow.The melted butter boat accompanying the lobster roll was very generous so be careful if pouring! I suggest you dip the roll in it rather than pour- better for the waist line and the heart i imagine!Only two mousses for dessert: the choc coffee and the lime. Both served in a small cardboard container. Both quite lovely.All in all, if its lobster you want, this is the place to go.We have decided to visit again to try the burger. All ten ounces of it! Will add that experience to my reviews.",

    "text": "Burger and Lobster in Mayfair is truly a unique and tasty experience. Opened in the latter half of 2011 by Goodman, this restaurant has already had a big impact in the capital. As the name suggests, there is no menu but the choice of Burger or Lobster. To be more precise you can chose between a whole grilled or steamed Canadian Lobster (I recommend having it grilled), a Lobster Roll or a Burger with all the trimmings, each priced at \u00a320. There are some great sides included, some lovely extra crispy french fries and yummy garlic and herb butter to dip your crustacean in. The side salad was ok, though a little drowned in dressing which made it a little soggy. There are also some impressive cocktails to keep you occupied while you wait for your food to arrive, they are quite pricey at \u00a39 but they are of top quality and go down very well. If you are hoping to have dinner at The Burger and Lobster, I recommend you head down there before 6pm if you can, to guarantee a table. They do not except reservations and I have known of people waiting for over two hours for a table. Having said this, the staff are charming and if you only go once to this unusual place, you will find the food and atmosphere something you may never experience anywhere else in London and all for only \u00a320! itsnosmallthing.weebly.c\u2026",

    "text": "It's hard to express in words my excitement when first hearing about this place. I like burgers. I like lobster. Imagine a place that is a combination of both of these wonderful things and it's by the people behind Goodman, people who really know about burgers. As it happens I was ill on the opening day and had to wait to indulge myself. Luckily with the Monday off from work I set out in the downpour, not letting anything stand in my way of stuffing that lobster down my throat. A short walk from Green Park station the sign is quite low key and could possibly be missed if you were casually passing by. Inside the first thing you see is the lack of the 600 litre tank, the largest lobster tank in Europe apparently. If you're really curious then ask the staff and they will show you the vats which are a lot less impressive than you would imagine and btw, no, you can't point out which lobster you want for your meal. On to the menu. There are two things you can have, burger or lobster. Yes, that's it. But that's plenty. The options are all \u00a320 each and now you might be wondering why a burger here is more than a burger at any of the Goodman branches? The answer is that it is bigger. Then there is the lobster, which comes as a whole lobster \u00a0grilled or steamed \u00a0or as a roll. Having heard good things about the roll and convincing myself that no matter how much I wanted there was no way I could fit both burger and lobster that day I went with the roll. When it arrived I initially regretted my choice. Instead of a massive burger or a whole lobster there was this tiny little roll in front of me \u00a0the looks were deceiving though, I was pretty full afterwards. My first bite into the roll made me wish I could have more than one roll. It was incredibly tasty. The lobster married perfectly with that pillowy, sweet brioche bun. In short, \u00a320 for lobster is a great deal and Burger&Lobster really know how to cook them. Go now before they raise their price.",

    "text": "It's no surprise that everyone in London wants to give this place a try - I don't know of any other restaurant that will serve you a whole lobster of \u00a320! Went on a Monday night at 630pm and had no issues getting a table. They don't seat you until the entire party arrives so it's not exactly group friendly. I liked how the booze menu was separated into burger and lobster - nice touch! Service was a bit spotty I have to say, but mostly fine.Word of advice, it's not a place to go for a first date if you're planning on eating the whole lobster. I asked for mine to be steamed instead of grilled just because I find the lobster tends to be juicier! Once the monster-sized lobster arrived, the bib and handwipes came in handy because I kept getting lobster shells/juice/meat everywhere...not very attractive! It's so much fun to be able to pick the meat yourself - for those who would rather not deal with the mess, go for the lobster roll (marinated with a mayonnaise-ish sauce and served in a hot-dog brioche bun). The table beside us had the burger - looked the same in shape, size as the one at Goodman's (both places are owned by the same people). Just head to Maddox St, not worth paying an extra \u00a37 for the same thing.Although I ate as fast as I could mostly because I felt bad with the number of people waiting at the bar, it was still a 2 hour dinner which could be why it takes so long to get a table. Go early, otherwise the chances of getting a table are slim - unless you don't mind eating at 1030pm just before closing!I would give it 5 stars...but the spotty service + oversalted and nearly inedible chips let the place down. It's worth going, but I definitely wouldn't wait for 3 hours.",

Long queues to get a table can also be frustrating.A good venue for a group but often long waits for table don't make it an ideal place to meet (bookings are only taken for groups of 6-10). I still can't decide where I stand, so you'll just have to go and try it at least the once to make up your own minds.",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place. There can be long queues, especially at popular dinner and lunch times, but totally worth it. I've tried both the burger and lobster roll, and have never been disappointed. The lobster roll is packed with lobster meat and served on a delicious buttered brioche roll (yes, that bun alone might be a heart attack, but lipsmacking good i say!). The burger almost seems expensive at 20 pounds compared to the lobster and lobster roll, which are all offered at the same price, but definitely one of the great burgers of London.This restaurant has been expanding around London, but I've only been to the Mayfair and Soho locations which are very different in terms of ambience (same amazing level of food). The Mayfair location is smaller and feels more intimate while the Soho location has more tables and feels more modern. These locations have different perks but you really can't go wrong when burger or lobster is involved!",

I arrived expecting to wait for an hour, but the wait on a Sunday at around 1230 is closer to thirty minutes. Not too bad. There were bar seats that were immediately available though. We decided to go halves on the burger and the lobster roll. I quenched mine with a gin, Earl Grey, watermelon juice iced tea, which was quite refreshing. Let's start off with the burger:The bun was not of the buttery brioche type variety, but was very clean, and good. The ratio of meat to bun was perfect, well balanced, very much like what you'd get at Patty and Bun or Meat Liquor. We ordered our patties medium rare, and they were delivered perfectly cooked, with a nice amount of pink in the centre of the patty. On a subsequent trip, the patty was over-done, so don't hesitate to send yours back if not cooked to perfection. You are paying 20\u00a3 for the burger, after all.As I took a ginormous bite out of it, the juiciness of the burger exploded in my mouth, and all the ingredients came together. Perfect. The lobster roll for me is the star of the show... it's so hard to find a decent lobster roll in this city, and this one if pretty f-ing decent. Not too much butter, the taste of the lobster comes through, and it's pretty loaded up. I kinda didn't want to share it.All in a all a great place, pricey, but definitely on my 'take people to' list in London.Go there.But bear in mind: the burgers are better in my mind at Patty and Bun or even Meat Liquor. But the lobsters... my goodness!",

But all that really means is that I have very high standards for my lobster and burgers.Went for my first time tonight and I'm hooked. Yes, you will have to queue (I'm trying to use my British as much as possible!) if you are a bigger party, but the best kept secret is the bar seating with a full menu (all 3 options!). There was pretty consistently 2-3 seats together opening up, so if you don't mind sitting with other people that's your free pass on the wait.Had the lobster roll and it was terrific. The bread was well toasted with just the right amount of butter. The lobster was great, simple, light mayonaise only (I always order without onions) and the lobster was fresh with just the right amount of firmness.Add on-top some great chat with the staff behind the bar, this is a winning (but yes, pricey) spot and I fear it may become a regular spot for me.",

The place is cosy, not huge but not claustrophobic and noisy as other central places. The staff is very friendly and nice.They only serve 3 dishes as the name suggests: burger, lobster grilled or steamed and the lobster roll. All is served with french fries and salad. I went for the lobster roll, which was a sort of savoury brioche filled with delicious chopped lobster meat: great. The drinks list is also nice, with a lot of original cocktails designed to be served with each one of the available dishes. I took a beer, but my friends tries some lobster cocktails and they looked very good. The food is good and the price is very cheap (we paid \u00a322.5 each), the only problem with this place is that they don't take reservations and the list for tables is always very long (at 8 there were 2.5 hours waiting time). Also, once you are in, they don't urge you to leave after dinner, so the people in the queue do not really have a sense of when they will be seated.",

It's hard to go wrong with grilled whole lobsters (slight smokey flavour on the outside and perfectly cooked meat with a bit of bite!), with garlic butter and really crispy fries that are soft on the inside. The service is pretty quick, and given the amount of people waiting, they are very patient and don't mind you hanging around a bit after your meal to finish your conversation.

    "text": "I love it when a restaurant lives up to the hype. \u00a0Yes, the wait was a bit longer than we'd like but always a plus if you like to drink and can squat at a pub for a few hours before. \u00a0I went with 3 other Americans and we ended up ordering 6 mains for the 4 of us... so we can each get half of all 3 items. \u00a0If we waited this long, we might as well get the full experience! \u00a0Here's how I'd rate them1) Lobster - Definitely my favorite of the 3. \u00a0It was fresh, perfectly cooked and comes with this amazing garlic butter that's really good dipping your fries in (and a friend slathered a bit on his burger!).2) Lobster roll - Yes, it is small but so tasty! \u00a0If that was the only thing I was having, I wish it was bigger but that night glad it wasn't.3) Burger - It was a really delicious (and HUGE) burger. \u00a0But I think for 20 quid, I'd probably stick to the lobster when I go back. \u00a0Oh and the fries - how do they make it so good?",

It was by far, the absolute best burger I have had in years!! The meat was delicious, but most impressive was how perfectly cooked it was.Recommend 100%....",

    "text": "Good burgersUHMAZING picklesgood saladUHMAZING chips/fries/frittesThe bar is stocked with really top shelf booze. The cocktails are greatBeer selection is teenyI arrived with a fellow Yelper Tirth who's name is too hard to pronounce and began calling him Timbuktu. That's neither here nor here. We were told it would be an hour wait for lunch on a saturday at 1pm, so we headed to the bar only to find a place for us. YAY! There are only 3 items on the menu, and I saw no one with a lobster roll on their table, so I went with the burger like the other 2 blokes I was with. I ordered mine Medium well and it was still really pink in the centre, not quite what I'm used to coming from the states, but it was OK. The burger had as smoky flavour and I'm not a fan of smoke. So it was OK, and I'm sure by gourmet standards it was divine. I am not a fan of making a burger gourmet.... its a BURGER, street food. I think it should be kept that way. \u00a0 The pickles were the best part. Seriously, it was sweet and spicy and vinegary. Great. The fries were equally tasty and free-flowing (FREE REFILLS). Collectively we had about 5 orders of fries. over all.... good. but I would go again for the lobster roll and cocktails.",

Lobsters are from maine. Steamed then finished on the grill giving that extra oomph. Fries stayed crispy throughout. Salad perfectly dressed. Beer is good. Even the cappuccino is wonderful.Service is excellent and staff is very friendly. Strongly recommend.",

    "text": "There's not a lot I can add that hasn't already been said - except perhaps that if long wait times aren't your thing, Monday nights are the way to go. We walked in at 7pm and got a table pretty much straight away. I even overheard the maitre d' comment that on a Monday night, people tend to get in and out with lingering - so even if there is a wait, it doesn't tend to be as long. All that said, I've now been to Burger and Lobster three times and had all three things on the menu. (I've also managed to have the lobster roll at each sitting. It's THAT good). Lobster is definitely the main game here. A whole lobster for \u00a320 is definitely tempting, but can I just mention again the lobster roll.... (can't decide? Get both - I do!)I'm a burger junkie, so I have broken into nervous sweats each time I skip past the burger here. I have now tried it and can confirm the burger is excellent - however it isn't really worth \u00a320 (I wonder if that's what helps keeps the lobster prices so reasonable?). My tip - if it's just the burger you want, go to Goodman's Steak Restaurant (Burger and Lobster is a Goodman's venture). It's practically the same excellent burger at \u00a314. Oh, and they take reservations.",

    "text": "London's hottest restaurant serves just 3 items...lobster, lobster roll, and burger. But oh does it do those 3 things to perfection.The burger (with crispy bacon of course) was exceptional and came with a side of chips and a small mixed salad. A bit pricey at 20 pounds considering that also gets you a whole lobster, but I'd definitely get the burger again. My friend literally was drooling over his lobster roll which comes with it own gravy boat of melted butter. A perfect last meal before starting that low-cholesterol diet!Crowd was upscale though rather intoxicated/rowdy...clearly folks are drinking heavily while they wait 1-2 hours for a table. Which to be honest almost had me mark Burger & Lobster down a star---the adjacent table was too drunk too obnoxious, I felt bad for the waitress. In the end the food wins out.Burger & Lobster takes no reservations so get there early or be prepared to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.",

I have never got the burger and I never will as the Lobster is far to good a deal. The Lobster is just a dream of meal. I actually prefer it to the whole Lobster just cos it's so perfectly formed and less messy.",

Not inexpensive, you don't get much lobster roll for \u00a320 even if it is good!Had one incident with a staff member when they were less than friendly but aside from that all good. The queue is the thing that gets me though. You can't book so you either have to eat super early or wait in the queue for ages. What I have been able to do is hold a place in the queue with the person on the door and go for a drink nearby and they call you when your table is ready!Definitely a place to try, might be a one night only thing but worth a look.",
