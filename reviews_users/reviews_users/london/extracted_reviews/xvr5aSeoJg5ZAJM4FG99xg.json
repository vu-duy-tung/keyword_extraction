    "text": "Let's start by saying the food here is five stars. Really good dishes with tons of flavor. While they are small(ish) plates they are rich and filling. My wife and I ordered:House vermouth- \u00a36 vermouth is now one of my favorite drinks. This one was mixed with soda water which isn't how I like vermouth but when in Rome...good aperitif thoughOlives-\u00a33 generous portion. Although manzanilla olives aren't my fav, still a good nibble to start with. Bread and olive oil- \u00a32 maybe should have gotten pan con tomate but this was excellent. Bread was like the bread in Spain, warm and fresh. We had the above while we waited for the second seating. We arrived just after 5 pm an already the bar was full. But luckily we sat in about 30 minutes. And hey in Spain you never seem to sit. When we sat at the bar we were given specials which were mostly the seafood of the day. Let me tell you, these go quickly so order ASAP if you want one. After perusing the regular menu we settled on:Fried artichokes- \u00a35 this dish was done right mostly the artichoke heart and lots of flavor in even without the excellent dipping sauce. Omelette- \u00a37 when it came it didn't look like much but when we cut into it there waters potatoes and a flavorful rich sauce that tasted a bit like Worcestershire Chicken wings- \u00a3 6 this was our favorite dish. Three full wings with probably the best dipping sauce I've had this year. Smokey tomato with some zing. A little like salsa but not as watery. Would love to return just for this sauce. Quail- \u00a38 two breast and leg combos cooked more in a sweet raisin and but sauce. Also very tasty and much easier to eat than they look. We didn't have room for dessert but finished off with a sweet sherry \u00a37. When we ordered the waiter asked if we had tried Pedro Jimenez before and gave us an eye of wonder when we had. The seating is all around the bar where they prepare the food so you he to watch them and their banter which is great fun.So why isn't this a five star place? Because it's just not Spain. It's new and has a Michelin star and is in the west end , not some hole in the wall in Madrid where all this would cost \u20ac20. So overall great food great drinks. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "It has been several days since I visited Barrafina, but I am still dreaming of their food. This may be due to the after-effects of the two bottles of sherry that we drank between three of us, but I prefer to think that it was the excellence of the fare, and the simple joy of watching all your food being freshly prepared in front of your eyes.We had to wait 40 mins to get a table, which didn't seem totally unreasonable given we arrived at 8pm on Saturday evening. Pleasingly you can get a good selection of food as you wait, so you can be half-full by the time you take your seat at the bar/table - perfect if you are a person like myself who becomes unreasonably grumpy when the blood-sugar levels start to drop!Probably the highlight of the whole meal came as we were waiting for our table - the innocuously named 'banderilla', which included an extraordinarily scrumptious soft-boiled quail's egg wrapped with an anchovy; it sounds so simple, but it was truly marvellous! I'd also recommend the jamon de bellota, crab croquetas, scallop ceviche, and the rhubarb pudding thingamajig, but there are another dozen dishes I'd love to try on another visit.The service was perfectly pitched, and achieved the rare feat of being simultaneously casual and attentive. Apparently several of the waiters were 'gorgeous' - not being that way inclined I didn't really notice, but one of my friends was very taken by a number of them...The only catch? Three of us managed to rack up a bill of \u00a3240 - not ridiculous, but perhaps unexpectedly large. However, if you like to look at hot Spanish men cooking delicious food then this is the place for you!",

Price wise, definitely you get value out of every penny you spend here. \u00a0Their wine list is not extensive but efficient.

    "text": "I went to Barrafina with my company for our annual Christmas party, so I can only speak to the experience of a private party in the downstairs bar area. I don't have any experience with their standard menu or service.The space itself is really nice - there are bathrooms away from the main restaurant, so we weren't likely to bother anyone. It's a nice touch, as private parties can get a little loud. There was also a coat closet, again, nice touch.Our menu was a series of tapas to start with a mix of seafood (which I'm told were fantastic, but I don't eat seafood) and veggie plates. We had bread with olive oil (excellent bread), crab croquettes (highly rated by my colleagues), sweet roasted peppers (good, but underwhelming), fried artichokes with aioli (very yummy), gazpacho (best I've had), and a platter of cured meats that was very nice.Our mains were a choice of pork belly, a vegetarian option (roasted vegetables on toast - much nicer than it sounds), or a fish (highly rated by my colleagues). I had the pork belly, and it was very good. Fell apart on your fork, and seasoned very well. The sides served with it were a hot potato dish (excellent) and a salad of fennel, pear, radish, and dill (also excellent). Dessert was an outrageous chocolate tart with a marscapone ice cream. I absolutely loved it.Overall, the quality of the food was very high. The seafood was raved about around me, and I really enjoyed the meat dishes. The vegetarian plates were a bit hit and miss, though. They were good, but not outstanding and not really anything special. The sauces and gazpacho were fantastic, though. High marks for seasoning and flavour.I would go again, but I reckon if paying myself I might feel a bit frustrated with the dishes that miss their mark.",

These are not the common tapas you can get at the other spanish tapas bars in London... some regional authentic stuff that's hard to find elsewhere. Everything we ate was amazing and beautifully served. We were getting food envy just by looking at our neighbor's orders... and it's hard to figure out when to say stop to tapas.

Everything was delicious and I remember myself fiercely protested when our server attempted to take away an almost empty place - there's still some sauce at the bottom! \u00a0Our server was patient and friendly.

I saw several plates redone to his satisfaction before they were served.It's a lively place with call and response by the staff. Highly recommended.",

My favourite was the Spanish spot prawn which was flown in on the day. The tuna tartare with avocado moose was delicious. The endives with anchovies and bacon was good, as was the Tortas/quiche. Pretty much what ever you order will be served with great talent and effort. Bring your check-book as it is not cheap but worth the price of admission.",

It can be quite tricky to get a seat because the space is small and everything is served at the bar, but the staff made a real effort to make sure our group of three could sit together - even asking other customers to scoot down so that we could get seats together! The tapas are pricey, but the food is very high quality. I especially loved the fried artichoke and the crab croquetas. Sitting at the bar means you can see every other dish being prepared right in front of you, so we definitely ended up ordering some extra food when we saw something fantastic being whipped together!",

It was deep fried with a texture of an oyster, and the chilly tomato sauce on the side really brings a good contrast with the dish. We also ordered the scampi, padron peppers etc. In general they are all finger-lickin' delicious and the atmosphere was ambient and staff were very welcoming. Can't wait to go back again!",

Watching them keep everything straight with so much going on was really impressive to watch!The crab croquettes were a great nibble. We shared the Jamon iberica which paired very well atop the pan con tomate (order a piece per person). But the real show stopper was the pork ribs. Yummm. The meat just fell from the bones in all the right ways. Many others around us got the stuffed courgette flower \u00a0(zucchini for fellow Americans !) which was stunning in its presentation ! We showed up at about 545 on a Sunday night (before a bank holiday) and had about a 50 min wait, although we were quoted an hour 20 so this was quite ok! They fill up immediately when they open and don't take reservations or names. But they have a great system and will set you up with a spot to wait and order nibbles or drinks with complimentary still or sparkling water. The wait went quickly and we were able to watch what others were ordering and it helped us decide what we wanted to get when we were sat. This restaurant is all bar seating along one winding bar top, but it looks like they have a space for entertaining downstairs you can rent out.Highly recommend!",

We then proceeded to order an amazing round of small plates: lightly fried fresh Anchovies (special); Fried Oysters (special); Prawn & Bonito Carpaccio; and Crab on Toast. \u00a0Every dish was an amazing mix of tastes and textures expertly prepared and presented.I already suspected our meal would be amazing due to my previous visits to Barrrafina in Soho and I was not disappointed. \u00a0And my girlfriend, who'd never been, is dying to go back. \u00a0Luckily, we are in London for several more days.",

You will not be disappointed (or hungry)!The next thing I loved about Barrafina was the atmosphere. \u00a0The bar style seating made it easy to interact with our server and order dish after dish with his expert recommendations and we were able to watch the chefs in action! \u00a0Great place for a date or dinner between two friends, but would be difficult to have a conversation with more than 3 people because of the seating. \u00a0It was well lit and had a decent volume level which are both very important to me. Finally, the service was outstanding. \u00a0Our server, Nico, had a contagious smile and attitude that made the experience that much better. \u00a0He is always laughing and you can sense the passion he has for his job. \u00a0It showed in the expertise he offered too. \u00a0If only every restaurant had a Nico!Bottom line - just go here. I can't think of one reason not to. \u00a0But keep in mind it is relatively small so you may have to wait - it will be well worth it!",

The menu has a great variety of different kinds of dishes: meats, fish, seafood, vegetables, rice, pasta, cold, hot, spicy and sweet.... All in small delicious bites. We tried many different tapas, and we liked one more than the other. The flavors are incredibly good and at times the combination of ingredients surprising. Staff was friendly and service good. Drawbacks: very loud and crowded restaurant. They do not take reservations and the line to get seated can be long, any day of the week. Do not go there expecting to have a quiet meal.

Perfectly crunchy, fragrant and fresh.Arroz Negro - cuttlefish and squid ink paella cooked perfectly slightly al dente, with two juicy crispy king prawns on top. The paella was sufficiently moist without being runny or saucy.Cod fritters - how special can fried cod be? They certainly made it yummy by stuffing them full of meat that was juicy somehow with garnished with slivers of peppers for a little kick.Tortilla - perfectly formed, firm on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside with onions, egg and potentially a white white reduction. Delicious.Love this place and will be back regularly.",

    "text": "I was walking around Covent Garden with a friend late Friday evening, intending to just grab another glass of wine somewhere, when we stumbled across Barrafina, which has been at the top of our to-dine lists for ages. Luckily, with the opening of two new locations (including this one), the Michelin starred restaurant has become a lot more accessible, despite its no reservations policy. We were given an estimated wait time of 45 minutes, but you spend all of that at one of their many window ledges, with a menu of \"para picar\" bar snacks and a wine list, so what more do you need? Plus, the para picar is also part of the main menu, so it's like eating your first course while you wait.We got an order of crab croquettes, which was absolutely lush. It was oozing with crab, as opposed to crab cakes that are generally more starchy and solid. We also got a bottle of red wine, the Old Vines 2012 Espelt, that was beautifully smooth and one of the best wines I've had in a long time. (One bottle ended up not being enough). The wait time flew by and before we knew it, we were seated at the bar, surrounded by Spanish people on either side. A lot of the clientele seem to be Spanish... it can be argued that they get somewhat better service. In any case, that's when you know you are at a very authentic restaurant.Since we'd already had a bite to eat earlier, we refrained from ordering the whole menu, but it would have been rude to not get at least a few dishes. We got the Spanish tortilla with prawns, garlic, and mushrooms, though I didn't note any prawns, and it was more of a dark, flavorful, almost soy sauce tasting version of Spanish tortilla. I would definitely recommend it. We also got one of the seafood specials, which was described to me as a fried mini dover sole. That was ok, but difficult to eat because of all the bones. Meanwhile, I had massive food envy at the Spanish girls next to us who ordered chipirones, basically fried calamari - should definitely have gotten that. Lastly, we got the Iberian pork ribs, the star of the show. It was basically like a beef stew type of sauce with braised onions and carrots, and the short rib falling off of the bones. So amazing. And a very generous portion size, much larger than what you would expect for tapas.We sat at the bar for quite a bit, talking with the staff and the fellow diners seated next to us. I think it would be difficult to come with a group larger than 3, simply because it's difficult to make conversation with large groups while seated at a bar. We did not feel any pressure to leave, and there weren't many arrivals after us because the restaurant closes at 11 PM (must be disappointing for diners accustomed to Spanish dinner time). But now that I know how pleasant the wait experience is, I would definitely come again! It was infinitely better than my time at Social Wine & Tapas, where you are crammed in a tight lobby with no food or drink until the very end. Barrafina was amazing, can't rate it highly enough!",

I wanted to marry it)Prawn and bonito ceviche ( I could pickle myself in that sauce too)Chicken wings with some type of well-sexual harissa sauce (Oh, why can't all men be like this in bed)Good:Suckling pig (not crispy or thin skin enough, perhaps it's coz we got the trotter? In any case, not worth the price tag, I mean, this ain't got nothing on a Chinese suckling pig)Chicory in a salmorejo sauce (Perfectly... OK. \u00a0Bit DULL. Again, spend your money elsewhere)Not recommended:Mushroom carpaccio (\u00a37 for 1 poxy sliced mushroom with a bit of garlic and salty oil, SERIOUSLY? \u00a0SERIOUSLY ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LIKE, I CANNOT GET OVER THIS)Alameda sherry- they poured me the wrong one by mistake. \u00a0It was FREE and we couldn't finish it. \u00a0Wayyy too almondy and pungent, I would recommend going the full hog for a PX if you want a dessert sherry. \u00a0It's like having a PX without the sex appeal.We split a house cava (was told an 1 hour wait, ended up being only 30 minutes) and I had a La Gitana as well. \u00a0Perfectly quaffable. \u00a0House cava had the virtue of being organic.For \u00a3100- well some of the dishes were wayyy overpriced (YES, MUSHROOM I AM LOOKING AT YOU). \u00a0I would definitely be back to try the fried food and other numbers on the menu, but will also definitely be getting my 5-a-day elsewhere. Probably won't recommend you to bring your vegetarian friend with you to this one...Also, 5 dishes between 2 would be plenty unless you are feeling particularly greedy.YES. \u00a0THAT FRIGGING MUSHROOM LOST YOU A STAR.",

    "text": "Had a very enjoyable meal at Barrafina late on a Friday evening. Came with a friend who had been before. Was told on arrival 20-40 minute wait, and it was 45. Not too bad as we had a drink and our starter of Cuttlefish Croquetas stood at the window where theres a convenient shelf built exactly for this purpose. All the seating is at the bar with views of the food being cooked. We ordered 4 tapas between 2 of us, being assured by the waiter that this would be sufficient. We ordered John Dory, Octopus, Quail and Suckling Pig. I would say it was all delicious. The Octopus was not really for me though my mate really enjoyed it, for me it was just a bit too chewy. A 12.5% service charge is automatically added to the bill, bringing our total to \u00a3128. The food was great, but for me that was just a bit too expensive for what we had. In summary great food, but star lost for long wait time, high prices and auto service charge.",

I had the stuffed courgette flower and the Tapa de Entrecot Gallego. The sweet honey flavor of the flower played well with the tang of the cream cheese, the steak was well seasoned, and the potatoes perfectly crisp yet tender. I recommend going alone, people think it's lonely but you get sat more quickly, make friends at the bar, and get food faster -- which sounds more lonely now?",

Think about it- that's actually amazing! And it was awesome to come with another couple because we could try more food! We all sat at the bar and the waitstaff was very accommodating- actually they were fantastic. I'm not sure if there is other seating downstairs or if everything is bar seating. Here's what we ate. Crab coquetas- creamy and delicious on the inside, and crunchy on the outside Pan con tomate- nothing like pan con tomate in Spain (I'm such an expert) but still deliciousArroz de Marisco- delicious! I thought it tasted like paella but maybe it's not. Full of flavour and the rice has that nice texture that paella has. Stuffed courgette flower- oooooh yes this was delicious. Super crunchy on the outside and a creamy surprise on the inside!Judion, fennel and smoked salmon- Very lovely flavours. Fresh, crunchy, healthy, deliciousYellow Chicory, Don Bocarte Anchovies and Salmorejo- Another fresh and delicious dish. The price is pretty steep on this one but it was a nice addition.Milhojas- the most delicious dessert!!! layers of fluffy pastry with the creamiest custard in the centre. YUM!This was a fantastic experience with great drinks, delicious food and wonderful people.",

The one on Adelaide street serves the signature lamb's brain, so obviously that's where my coworker and I went. This Michelin-starred tapas restaurant makes it to almost every list of London's must-try food spots. They serve authentic Spanish tapas that are great for sharing. However, because the dining area only has counter seating, it isn't ideal for parties larger than 3. We came for Tuesday dinner at 19:15 and were seated in a little over an hour. The wait is indeed quite daunting, but you will be rewarded with a flurry of small plates that are both delicious and creative. // Classic Tortilla (\u00a38.00) - 3 stars// Milk Fed Lamb's Brain (\u00a310.60) - 4 stars// Stuffed Courgette Flower (\u00a38.50) - 4 stars// Crab Croquetas (\u00a36.80) - 4 stars// Oyster, Lime & Chillies (\u00a33.90 each) - 3 stars// Herb Crusted Rabbit Shoulder (\u00a39.50) - 5 stars// Mackerel Special (\u00a315.80) - 4 stars",

This location is roomier with more seats at the counter. Still not an ideal place for parties larger than 3 for it is counter seating only and first come first serve. Service is prompt and very friendly. While a small thing it may be meaningful for some that the water (still or sparkling) is on the house. The food is as good as the SOHO location. My favorite are always the razor clams and the chicken wings. The wings are baked at high temps so that there is little fat left in the crispy skin. It is served with a bed of tomato based sauce. The Chicharr\u00f3n is not pork rinds instead it is a dish of super tender pork belly slices. The pork literally disintegrated in my mouth. The ox tongue is fanatically tender and the potatoes are pan fried with some Dijon mustard that gave it a little extra flavor. \u00a0The quail is grilled to perfection and accompanied by pickled vegetables. I think there isn't a bad choice on the menu.",

    "text": "What I love about Barrafina is that the tapas menu is really different from most of the tapas restaurant in London!The food is great and the vibe from the open kitchen is so cool!My fave dishes were the seafood ones we had: grilled razor clams and arroz de marisco.We also tried as starters the crab balls (very good, you can really taste the crab) the fuet platter was good but nothing special but the Iberco jamon was really good according to my friends (Im usually not a fan of Iberico ham so Im not a good judge on that)Other dishes were: some pork stew with peas and ham! bicadillo de calamar which I really digged. Fried chipirones (a classic, good but nothing special) and the tortilla with morcilla and piquino peppers.Overall all dishes were solid so you can easily order anything and be happy.Wine selection is also not your classic wines which is good if you re into trying out new things. We had the red wine called El Mago and it was superb went really well with all the tapas even the seafood onesThey have a specials board too!",

If you have to wait a bit for a seat, there's a reason - everything is so good and freshly prepared, the wine and drinks are great, and the chefs and other staff make you feel special and at home at the same time! There are thousands of restaurants in London and I have been here many times, and this is one of the few that I make a point to dine at (maybe more than once per trip). Love it!",

    "text": "Authentic Spanish, and delicious food, with some extra fusion dishes that you wouldn't traditionally find in Spain (like donuts and crab croquettes). This is not a cheap meal, and will probably run you about \u00a345-50 per person, but you'll get a good variety of food. The layout of this place is not conducive to large groups, so don't come here with more than 3 people. 2 is ideal, and you can do 3, but the seating is all along a long bar, so it's difficult to talk to a larger group (and even more difficult to get a seat to accommodate everyone).GET THESE (I listed them from my favorite to least favorite)Crab Croquettes (2 for \u00a36.50) - They will increase your order to 3 and price it accordingly if you need more per order, because sharing 2 croquettes amongst more than 2 people may be challenging. And these are delicious enough that you won't want to share one. It's cheesy, creamy and has crab inside and then deep-fried. I loved these and would recommend it.Iberian Pork Ribs (\u00a313) - This was the best dish of everything we ordered, and my other 2 dining companions agreed. I was skeptical before we ordered, but the meat was flavorful, tender, and just fell off the bone. I'd highly recommend this dish.Tortilla Classica (\u00a37) - Pretty standard tortilla espanola, but served fresh which I always like vs. the cold tortilla. It was really good and worth an order.Artichokes & Aioli (\u00a37.80) - These were deep fried artichoke hearts with an aioli sauce. They were delicious.Arroz de Mariscos (\u00a314.50) - Paella with seafood done right - tasty, not salty, and the rice was not over-cooked or mushy. I'd recommend; the portion size will feed 2-3 people.Jamon Iberico (\u00a315.80) - This was a last minute addition and it was delicious, and some of the best jamon iberico I've had. A bit on the pricey side, but there's a generous amount of meat.SKIP:Crab on Toast (\u00a38) - I found this to be a little weird and mushy in texture. It was crab mixed with tomato on toast -- I'd personally skip this, it's also hard to share.Donuts & Chocolate Sauce (\u00a37) - I typically love all desserts and I love anything with chocolate but this fell short for me. The donuts were dry and they were soft and fluffy. It was almost too dough-like, and the chocolate sauce on it didn't help the dryness. I'd pass and go find dessert elsewhere4.5 stars for this place - it's authentic Spanish tapas, but be prepared for a wait. It's not inexpensive, but for the quality of the food and for the variety that you'll eat, I say it's worth it.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in London, either going by myself on business travel or with a friend. Easiest to find a spot when you're just one or two. Even as a single diner you're made to feel welcome and catered to. The food is delicious and the small plate format is great for tasting several items and for sharing. The wine list is varied and reasonably priced and the waiters are open with advice and providing a taste before you make up your mind. Friendly, service oriented staff makes sure you are satisfied with everything you order. This is a fun place to try items you might never have tasted before because everything is fresh and well prepared. My favorites, after starting with a cava and marcona almonds and olives, include oxtail over whipped potatoes, a roasted Jerusalem artichoke special, fried baby artichokes, mussels, sweetbreads and rabbit. Only seating is an the counter with an open kitchen. So maybe not the best for a large group. I've been to the Barrafina at Drurie Lane and another near Charing Cross Station. The menus were slightly different but both were excellent and you can't go wrong.",
