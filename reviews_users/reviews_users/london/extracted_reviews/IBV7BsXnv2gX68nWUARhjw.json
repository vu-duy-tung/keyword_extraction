    "text": "My first meal in London! I came in after a few days in Ireland, so I really wanted a salad...which they did not have. I guess they're really called Mother Mash for a reason. I ended up getting a mushroom mash with a beef pie. Both were pretty good. and pretty solid food. The sauce thing they used for the mash was SUPER salty. I really loved the ginger beer they serve here, though I suspect ginger beer in London is just really good. The food itself was overly heavy for me. I really wanted some veggies, and I clearly shouldn't have come here. But it was pretty solid food, and if you wanted some mash, this would be good. When we walked in, there was zero space to wait. We didn't really know what to do, and my friend and I wanted to walk a little closer to their register to wait...and immediately got yelled at by their staff. WTF. There's NO SPACE FOR US TO WAIT. In order for people to exit, we (and the two people waiting after us) had to file out of the restaurant. And the waitress didn't acknowledge us when we came in. And she DARED to yell at us!? Hella wrong.",

We arrived at around 5pm and there was one other couple eating outside - we chose to sit inside. The menu is pretty straight-forward as you choose your protein (sausage, veggie pastry), your mash (tons of options for the potatoes), and your sauce. \u00a0I chose to be as healthy as I could and got a veggie pasty with butternut squash, a veggie sauce, and chunky mashed potatoes with cheese and chives. \u00a0Our server was very friendly and the food was out quickly and tasted really delicious. \u00a0The pasty was light and fluffy and full of veggies and the mash was freakin' good. We decided to dessert and split it and had an apple mash of some kind with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0It had the consistency of oatmeal or something but was really good. \u00a0My hubs loved it.I feel like it was a good choice for our first day in London.",

Sorry, but I'm one more of those... warning :)We had dinner at Mother Mash during our first night in London. I loved EVERYTHING about this place! Located in the trendy neighborhood of Soho, in one of those streets with super cool hanging lights/decorations, Mother Mash is a simple place with affordable and delicious food!We tried the chicken, leek and bacon pie, as well as the aberdeen angus steak pie. Both were great! But, the absolute highlights were the mashed potatoes! The cheesy mash and the horseradish mash were both phenomenal! \u00a0I gotta say that I didn't have high expectations for traditional British food, and this place certainly changed my mind :)",

Located in central part of Soho and close by to a lot of other hot restaurants so it can be easy to miss.The three of us got (for ~40\u00a3 overall):- Colcannon + Pork & Leek Sausage + Farmer's Gravy- Colcannon + London Smokey + Farmer's Gravy- Champ + Steak & Ale Pie + Traditional Gravy- Sticky Toffee PuddingThe family consensus was that London Smokey was the best in flavor, the Pork & Leek tasted funny and wasn't quite meaty enough, and the Steak & Ale was a solid dish to order if you've never tried it (albeit a tad salty). The potatoes were easily the best part. The sticky toffee pudding was delish and comes with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream or custard, though we were struggling to finish because of the entree portion size!I usually don't like places that ask you to pick your own combination, but Mother Mash hit the spot.",

Our server was adorable, cutest British accent, and answered all our American questions patiently. The cauliflower with cheese was to die for. The bubble and squeak and the colcannon were delicious! The puddings tempted us to lick our plates! When we didn't understand what was meant by custard, our waitress make sure that we got some to try. \u00a0Only thing that would make this place better would be some draft ciders and beers, everything is in bottles. The location is in an adorably quaint and funky alley in the Carnaby area. Prices are super reasonable and portions are large. It was our favorite meal of our two week trip!",

I've had far better sausage and mash but perhaps I'm just spoiled by the superior selection and quality of sausage and mash a number of quintessentially British pubs in the countryside. Maybe finding decent sausage is difficult in London and I don't understand that? Either way, it's fine and inexpensive, but not great. Ordering is simple. I had three sausages with bubble and squeak. The only sausage I remember was the London smokey one which had a nice sweet smoke flavor, otherwise, the rest was forgettable. Also, not a great beer selection, but the Camden Hells is your best option.I'd recommend sitting at a table near the front with chairs instead of a booth. The booth seating is very uncomfortable and requires one to sit up perfectly straight, stiff as a board, on hard wooden slats. I suppose if someone ate here regularly, though, they'd have excellent posture!",

After a long flight, brothers and I went to venture out in London with 1 thing on our mind: Bangers and Mash. We searched Yelp for the best one around and Mother Mash came up.We walked in and we were immediately seated. It was not busy at all when we arrived, but upon departure more and more people flew in.It took us about 5 minutes for us to decide what to get. For me I got the champ mash, with London smokey sausage, and traditional gravy. It took 7-8 minutes for our food to arrive which was very fast!Before we dug into our food, our waiter mentioned they had mustard (which was very zesty), and a sauce that was still foreign to us called HP sauce which was very sweet and tangy. My brother and I were in disbelief of the taste and flavor coming from our food. The potatoes were soft and had cheddar cheese and the crunch of the green onion, the sausage was unbelievably tender, \u00a0and the sauce was so perfect.We then got our bill, we paid, and left to explore London.Let's just say if I were to have a last meal on earth, I would go to Mother Mash. Service was great, prices were great, and food was delicious!",

The vegetarian pie I had was very small, with not much flavour - a Ginsters has more flavour than the one I was served! My partner's sausages were overcooked, and both dishes were absolutely drowned in gravy - making my pie very mushy. The mustard and cheese mash I had was just so tasteless, it was like they'd forgotten to put any flavour in - I even had to check that they hadn't accidentally served me the plain mash instead. Overpriced,I'd suggest going to Square Pie instead, in outlets such as Selfridges. Much more reasonably priced, plus the mash is incredible, as is the gravy. And, of course, the pies!",

But traditional English food is in reality hearty, delicious, and suited to the terroir; it has no less merit than any other European cuisine, it's just that it's too often executed horribly by Greene King pubs and their ilk. So a thought a few weeks ago, why does this have to be so? Mother Mash, I'm pleased to report, does traditional English food justice. Everything is prepared with care using great ingredients. The dishes are flavorful and the surroundings hip, cozy, and convivial, not kitschy. I had the bubble and squeak, Angus beef pie, and Farmers gravy, washed down with Bulmer's. The prices are very good for what you get. The service left a bit to be desired, although this was in part due to a language barrier with some of the waitstaff. Nonetheless, I'll be visiting Mother Mash again, as I applaud both the concept and the execution thereof.",

It is very close to Oxford Circus, relatively cheap with its location. No so busy on a Saturday night (maybe because of the heavy rain?). There are different combinations and side dishes to order, every of us was happy, we got what we wanted. I had pork and chilli sausages, it was quite hot, I liked it! Mash was smooth and I ordered some garden peas, perfect match.However, the high wooden benches were too high in my opinion, even there was a sort of footrest (single metal pole), couldn't fit 4 of us... and the seat was shallow with a straight 90 degree angle back. Just not comfortable at all... We decided not to give any tips, because the waitress wasn't friendly or attentive. The waiter was good, but he was gone at the end of our meal. I will go again, because of the affordable price range.",

Having a pretty similar taste we all got the mash with the steak pie and the traditional gravy. The pie, mash and gravy were excellent. Gravy nice and not too thick. Pies had a good balance of dough to filling with the filling having an excellent taste. The mash was good and made from real spuds. One disappointment - the horseradish mash was the regular mash with horseradish sauce. Could be better. Overall good food. Service was one of the most friendly ones I ever had. Can't beat a winning combination. Would be back.",

Brits like their food all in one bowl (or one pie) and in my very uneducated and uninformed opinion, this was the real deal. You can either get it as a pure mash, which I think means meat, mashed potatoes and gravy all together or more accurately in a pile. Or you get the meat in a pie with gravy and mash on top. I had the beef pie: it was Very good. The simple menu comes down to this: with pie or just in a pile? \u00a0The gravy is thin and very rich/flavorful. After a bowl of beef and mash there is not much room for anything else. It's difficult not to feel satisfied. It is a little place, and in a kind of winding set of streets in SoHo. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff. I'm not sure locals flock here but I found it to be good, even if it is not authenticity local.",

Finished everything and even added a sausage. Mash with French seeded mustard is a great combination, cannot taste the cheese most likely overpowered by the mustard. Steak & Ale pie crust was full of flavor (buttery) and crumbles in your mouth. Sausage was so-so a bit over burnt. Will go back after I run-off the carbo from this meal.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of mash. And pie. And gravy, so Mother Mash was a place I wanted to try for awhile. I came here for a substantial dinner before going to an event later in the evening. So the premise is simple: Choose a mash, choose a topping and choose a gravy. There's about five different mashes to choose from. I call it a topping, but it's really a pie or sausages. There are several pie and sausage options, so you can come back and try more. There are usually specials for the sausages and mash as well. Then you get to choose a gravy. There are a few types of that as well, so you can find something that tempts your palate. I had champ mash (potatoes, cheese and scallions) with a steak and kidney pie (from the specials) and farmer's gravy. I also got a side of buttered cabbage (for the veg, right?) The food was alright. The mash was well done and creamy. The gravy was packed full of flavor and rich, but there was something slightly off about it. My pie was were I was disappointed though. The crust is pretty terrible. It's hard and not nice or flaky at all. I didn't find any kidney in my steak and kidney pie, so I think it was just a steak pie. You can't really beat the price though. I got it all for slightly over a tenner. And I was really full when leaving. If I'm in the area and looking for a cheap meal, I'd probably come back. There's not much seating though, so I can see how during busy hours this may not be an option. I'd probably also get sausages instead, because the pie crust was just such a disappointment for me.",

It was also really filling. We plumped for a bottle of the Chilean Merlot to share too which went down extremely well!

    "text": "I have loved Mother Mash since it opened and thought it would be just the ticket for a catch up with a friend. Said friend had commented that when he moved back to NZ he would at least be able to get a decent pie, even if the Auckland nightlife doesn't compare to the glitz, glamour, variety and downright bizarreness that have characterised our nights (and early mornings) in Landaaahn. I saw this as a direct challenge and wanted to prove him wrong, as being a native Londoner I am nothing if not competitive.So - Mother Mash - \u00a0sparked my inner map, they do a good pie and a consistent sausage. Nothing to set the world on fire but still good. That's before we think about the mash.. oooh what a balm on a dreary day.Well colour me disappointed. Its been a year since I went there and I was let down sadly in my choices.. The sausages were an excellent new variety, smoky, but overcooked. I opted for the horseradish mash, imagining the wonderful mother mash mash warmed throughout by the heat and bite of \u00a0grated horseradish. Imagine my dismay when the mash arrived with a dollop of runny horseradish sauce on the SIDE. The SIDE. Bucking the trend that is the Mother Mash, with everything expertly blended and presented into the mash experience that I have on many an occasion. Thank the mother then that my friends meal was good - an excellent angus pie, cheesy mustard mash, the usual. This would have tipped my score up a star but the gravy was far more gloopy than I recall and had a whiff of the packet about it. I don't think it is but... not as good as my previous experiences and it was always so solid and consistent. I don't know if I would head back now, given the array of experience that there is on offer around Carnaby Street.",

    "text": "I love bangers and mash, and I was told this is the place for it.It is a small restaurant with friendly servers and a simple menu. First, you choose your mash. We tried the Champ Mash, the Colcannon Mash, and the Bubble and Squeak. My favourite was the Champ Mash -- it was flavourful; I've never thought to put spring onions in my mash! We could hardly finish all the mash because they give such generous portions. Then, you choose your sausage(s) or pie. Out of the sausages we tried (Pork and Chilli, Lincolnshire, Pork and Leek, and Venison which was the special of the day), my favourite was the Pork and Leek. It was a good combination, but the other sausages were nothing special. We also tried the Chicken, Leek and Bacon pie but after I took a bite of it, I wish we had ordered more sausages instead, because it was really dry...Finally, you choose your gravy. Farmer's gravy was the best because I love bacon and mushrooms. The Traditional and Chicken gravies were decent.To be honest, I was expecting extraordinary bangers and mash with all the good reviews and the price we paid. If you're already in the area looking for some comfort food, it's all right, but I would definitely not go out of my way to try Mother Mash.",

I also enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding and the honey cake--both smothered with delicious custard.

I walked out nearly 40 minutes later feeling like a true Londoner having sampled what must be labelled as the best of colloquial British food. The mash was creamy smooth, the pie was perfectly moist and the gravy was served generously. I ended with a treacle and custard dessert that left me feeling happy and indulged. Critiques include a lack of space in the restaurant, obviously the annoying lack of options due to the aforementioned supplier issue and slow, although very kind, service. I will be back again.",

It's not the kind of stuff that appeals to a lot of the \"clean-eating\" (bleh) modern palate. But if you like things that are actually tasty at a really affordable price then this spot is worth a trip. The steak pie was better than the mince beef.The sticky toffee pudding was a little disappointing. It just wasn't sweet enough, which may be due to our sweets-loving American palates. I've had sticky toffee pudding stateside that was one of the best things I've ever eaten so I really had my hopes up for it. The custard in particular was very thin and bland so I'd skip dessert if I went again and I'm still giving the place 5 stars because the pies are worth it.",

    "text": "After visiting the British Museum, we walked down to Mother Mash to try some English pies and sausages. Once arriving we could see the restaurant was small, but luckily we didn't have to wait for an available table. We ordered the chicken pie with leeks and bacon paired with cheesy mash and farmers gravy. Our other main dish was the premium pork and London smokey sausages with classic mash and traditional gravy. It was really cold and snowing that night so eating the dishes felt so comforting. Both dishes were great but I think my favorite was probably the chicken pie. The sausages were great but the pie was slightly better tasting and paired so well with the mash and gravy we chose. Service was average, but that seemed as a result of one person was doing it all so she was really busy.",

    "text": "Food was five stars, service was three, so we meet in the middle.We were looking for a spot with yummy bangers and mash in London, and for that I highly recommend Mother Mash. It's a small storefront, but grab a seat outside to people-watch and enjoy the location. The menu is a three-step, allowing you to choose your mash, main and gravy.I ordered the champ mashed potatoes, Cumberland links and traditional gravy. I also got a side of buttered savoy cabbage because I couldn't decide between champ mash or Colcannon. It was incredibly difficult to decide as everything sounded delicious. I do wish they put a description on their sausages, because I personally don't know the difference between Cumberland, Oxford, Smithfield, etc. until I asked our server. The mash was buttery, smooth and perfect with the crunch of spring onions. The Cumberland links were snappy with a hint of garlic, and paired excellent with the traditional gravy. I even mixed in some of my cabbage with my dish. Yum!My partner ordered the horseradish mash, Aberdeen steak pie (they do have vegetarian options), and Farmer's gravy. There was only a slight hint of horseradish (as big fans, we do wish it was a bit stronger), the pie flaky with tender, but slightly overcooked steak. The gravy though was to die for, with tangy red wine and smoky bacon flavors. Obviously do not come here if you aren't in the mood for something heavy, filling and comforting! I truly don't think you can go wrong with any combination.As far as service, we were sat then checked up upon, but when we weren't yet ready to order, it was about another 15 minutes until we were checked on again. The food came out quickly once we ordered, but the server forgot the side of cabbage I ordered, and didn't come back until we were almost done with our meal, when we had to ask for the side again.All in all, if you're looking for a flavorful and tasty bangers and mash, I do recommend! The ingredients taste high quality and full of flavor versus more traditional bangers and mash. Just know what to expect when it comes to service (as it seems a lot of other reviews comment on this as well). Can't complain about the price either!",

I can't guarantee it'll be a good combo. \u00a0My dish turned out delicious! \u00a0My friend ordered champ mash with angus beef pie, topped with traditional gravy - it was also delicious. \u00a0I didn't know mashed potatoes and meat pies could be so beautifully plated. \u00a0The mashes were extremely tasty and flavorful. \u00a0The pies were flaky; they didn't skimp out on the meat imo. \u00a0The gravy had perfect consistency. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting London. The prices were in a do-able price range if you're trying to eat on a budget (hard to do in London + eating out! lol)",

We had been doing some sightseeing and I was looking for a casual but nice spot with some good pie and sticky toffee pudding for my family to enjoy on our last day in London (it's London-I'm expecting some good stuff).The concept at Mother Mash is great- you pick your mash, pie/sausage, and gravy. The prices are reasonable and it's in a great area. While the food was pretty good, the poor service really let me down. We had arrived an hour before closing and luckily they had a table open. Our waitress promptly took our order and when I asked if we should order our dessert now or later, she quickly said to wait and order it later. We didn't see her again until we left the restaurant (like seriously didn't see her-this spot is small and you can see everyone in the dining area); someone else dropped off our food, and then someone else came by to ask if we wanted to order anymore drinks before the check. When I asked if we could order dessert, the waitress informed me they were no longer taking food orders because the kitchen had closed. As a huge dessert fan, I was irritated to say the least. Considering how small this place is, how did we not see our waitress again and why tell me not to order dessert if you're going to ignore us for the rest of the evening?! She magically appeared as we were walking out and rest assured she got some side eye from me.There were a ton of great looking restaurants in the area so I probably won't be giving Mother Mash another shot.",

After being unsuccessful on the clothes shopping front, we decided to get some food.The restaurant is quite small so you might have to wait a while for a table. Fortunately, the employees there are really nice and willing to do some creative things to get people seated. He noticed one table of folks were lingering after they finished their meal but didn't want to be rude by just kicking them out. So he offered to give them all a free glass of wine if they were willing to sit outside instead! Pretty cool.I got the colcannon mash with the chicken, ham and leek pie and farmer's gravy. So delicious! Usually, I don't expect much of the \"mash\" part of the dish but the colcannon was really good and almost outshined the pie. The pie itself was also very good. The mushy peas were not the most interesting I've ever had but they weren't bad either.They only have bottled beer, which I guess should be expected from a place like this but you don't come here for the beer so that's fine.Prices are very good considering the quality and location of the restaurant -- great casual place to go out with a small group of friends (not good for larger groups).",

    "text": "If you generally enjoy sausage and mash when you go to the pub, then stop reading and just come to Mother Mash. If you are still reading I guess I need to tell you how good the food is at this place. I have been there quite a few times and always try something new....and I'm always very happy with my choice. Portions are just the right size, not too small not to big and a beer compliments the dish very well. \u00a0It goes without saying that you have the widest and tastiest sausages, mash and gravy in London but also the staff are nice and service is quick. On my last visit I took one of my work colleagues from the Luxembourg office and we had very little time before his flight....in and out in25 mins with 2 telephone conversations that interrupted our meal. He obviously loved it and the fact that it looks like diner/caf\u00e9 did not put him off at all. It's a great value for money and price wise not much different than McDonalds...so get in there!",

    "text": "My friend and I were bent on trying bangers and mash before we left London, so we turned to Yelp and found this place. We decided to come here during a late night study break, but contrary to the Yelp description, Mother Mash does not open until midnight (at least not on Sundays). We went back the next day and found it completely empty around lunch time. The menu is fairly simple: for something around \u00a37, depending on whether you take out or eat in, you can choose your mash, gravy, and sausage (or pie for an extra \u00a31). I got the cheesy mash, farmer's gravy, and pork and leek sausage. The portions are generous, and the food is really good. I loved my sausage, but the gravy was a little bit too sweet and not quite suited to my sausage and mash. Something about the consistency of the mashed potatoes was weird, too, but I've noticed it a lot in London, so maybe the Brits just make it differently.Anyway, cute place, pretty good food. Don't think I'll go back, but that's probably more because I'm not really a bangers and mash kind of girl.",

Decided to drop via here to refuel after a busy shopping day & wasn't disappointed - really yummy food, friendly staff, & reasonably priced.Specializing in simple, homely food with a straight forward menu, you have a choice of pie or sausages with mash potato & gravy. I found the ordering system refreshingly to the point: you choose your mash, you choose your meat, & you choose your gravy, and then you get exactly what you ordered!I had the champ mash (butter, cheese & spring onions) with cumberland sausages & traditional gravy, and it was delicious!At \u00a38 pounds for the meal it was reasonably priced, & I felt free to order a glass if plonk with the meal too; as well, that bill didn't come with a service fee attached to it -which I hate- so I didn't mind leaving my change for a tip.Admittedly the seating wasn't the most comfortably inducing to settle in for a prolonged period if time, but over-all I had a great experience dining here, & will definitely keep this litte gem in mind for next time I need an Oxford St recharge.",

The choice of food is simple but very good. They have lots of different sausages and meat pies. They have a special sausage and pie each day that isn't always on the menu. It is pretty simple system. You pick if you want sausages or a pie. You get 2 sausages or 1 pie with your order. You then pick which sausages or pie you want.. Then you pick which mashed potato you want. Followed by which gravy.I am a big fan of the Cumberland, Beef and Guinness, and Beef and Bacon sausages. The Steak and cheddar pie is very tasty as well. The cheesy mash is my personal choice. Nice amount of mature cheddar and mash mixed in there. The traditional gravy is very tasty as well. The food is fresh and hot and if you can get a table outside it is a great spot to people watch since it is in such a busy shopping area. I would recommend trying this place out if you want a good dose of traditional English comfort food.",

And if I was a die-hard vegetarian, I might have cause to complain about the non-meat options as well. But with all that in mind, I still enjoy going to MM. I like the dinky wooden booths you sit in, and the funky artwork on the walls, and the no-fuss menu that gets straight to the point. Pick your mash, pie, gravy, and you're done. The food is always filling and tasty, and virtually guaranteed to give you the warm fuzzies before you leave the premises. Also, the staff are very considerate. Went at lunchtime with friends, but hadn't thought to book beforehand. We had to make do and sit outside in the chilly spring weather, but the waitress was kind enough to move us back inside once a table became available. Now that's the kind of service I like!",

    "text": "A very nice, cosy little place for lunch/dinner. They have a bunch of different types of mash. We tried the Champ, Colcannon and Cheesy mustard. They were all pretty good, though the cheesy mustard is probably an acquired taste. The spring onions in the Champ were a bit undercooked as well for people who dislike raw onions. Our favorite was definitely the Colcannon. For the mains, I would definitely recommend the pies over the sausages. Their pie crusts are delicious. We also tried their ginger beer, which was awesome! (Though the ginger taste is pretty strong, so it may not be everyone's favorite)",

Pie crust was flaky and I could taste the mustard in the mash. Farmers gravy made it a rich and delicious dish. It was finished with London Pride beer and hit the spot on a gray and cold day.

They've got a good selection of fillings (chicken and leek, steak and kidney, lamb - a daily special so not always available, etc) as well as different mashes. I noticed some reviewers complaining about there being too much gravy and since I'm usually not a huge gravy fan, I asked for it on the side which they kindly obliged. However, I really didn't need to have the gravy on the side because I basically used it all up because it was amazing! I mean the whole meal was great (took just a little bit to go because I was stuffed) and definitely a good place to check out if you want some good ole British pies and mash while staying in central London.Also of note, I made a reservation via OpenTable for 5 PM on a Friday night and there wasn't any line but I've heard there can be a queue so to be on the safe side, make a reservation.",

Our orders were taken quickly, and the food was brought out in a short time. I ordered bubble and squeak mash, the cumberland sausage, and onion gravy. My husband ordered the champ mash, cumberland sausage, and traditional gravy. Both plates were brilliant! The mash was flavorful, perfect consistency, and beautiful. The sausages amazing. The gravy was incredible, also perfect in every way. We ordered a fruit pie to share, and that was fantastic as well. If we lived in London, we would definitely return to this place frequently!",

When we arrived, it was still a packed house. Luckily, we didn't have to wait, which was good. On the negative side, our waitress really looked like she would rather be doing anything else in the world than serving us peasants. Despite this, our food and drinks still came out in a timely manner. I ordered the Cheesy Mash with Cumberland sausage. I really couldn't tell if these were good or not due to the gravy it was smothered in. Each of my three friends ordered a different mash/pie, which all came smothered in the same gravy. Maybe this is a British thing, but it made the dish super heavy. Plus, they all ended up tasting the same.Not sure where all of these great reviews are coming from...",

    "text": "While in London, of course you have to try bangers and mash!I loved this little spot tucked away on this small street alongside many other cute restaurants. This restaurant, as the name suggests, specializes in the amazing comfort food of bangers and mash. I could see why the brits love this meal on a cold and wet day.To best explain the menu, its a very \"build your own\" bangers and mash experience. You choose the type of mashed potatoes, your preference of sausage, and from a selection of gravies. This part was really fun because you could customize it exactly as you would like! We were able to all order something a little different and try from each other's plates.The mashed potatoes were thick and creamy and the sausages were really great as well. I particularly liked the apple sausage. We enjoyed how homemade it felt and how the dish warmed you up from being out in the cold.On my way to the bathroom, I peeked into the kitchen where you could see the chefs working away at mixing up the small batches of mashed potatoes, clearly the size of a single order. That impressed me to realize that they were mixing up your mashed potatoes as the orders were being placed. How fabulous!Would definitely come here again and would recommend this location for a traditional bangers and mash experience. Also, to add in, the cost is really worth the value. I believe the entrees were about 10-12 pounds per entree and we left with our bellies full.P.S. It is a bit of a small restaurant so I would not suggest group sizes larger than 2-4 people.",

I have to point out the service. Although I want to be fair - this place did seem understaffed. It was nearly impossible to grab the servers attention. When we finally did, she threw the menu and bill tray on our table. Throughout our stay, the servers didnt check up on us at all. With the gravy being on the salty side, I was dying for a drop of water and of course, I never got a refill. But I gotta say, their sticky toffee pudding was delicious!!

    "text": "Normally when you think of traditional British food, you think of bland potatoes and shepherd's pie (sorry Londoners, no offense - I think you have some of the best food in the world), and unhealthy food. This place definitely does not win any awards for healthy food - in fact, it's mostly carbs and meat. But it's pretty tasty if you want to indulge in some hearty food, want a quick meal, and don't want to have to hours for a table, this is a good bet. I was lucky and came in late around 9 pm on a weeknight and didn't have to wait for a table at all. Once I placed an order for my food 5-10 min later, my food came out in minutes which was great. I was done with the whole experience in 30 min. They also have free WiFi, which is nice if you're dining solo, or a tourist.The menu is pretty standard: you pick mash (basically mashed potatoes with additions inside like horseradish, cheddar, cheddar + mustard, and other options). Then you pick the sausage flavor, or a savory pie, and a gravy flavor. You either get the mash + 2 sausages, or mash + pie. You can also get the mash + pie option and add one sausage (the extra sausage being an incremental \u00a31.50). I was indecisive, and couldn't decide between the sausage or the pie, so I got all 3 which was good since I got to try everything.If you can't decide what to order, ask the servers for recommendations - they are pretty good at giving you suggestions if you tell them what kind of mash or meat you want, and telling you what gravy and other flavors combine well. I was happy with my server's recommendations and she was very patient with my indecisiveness and was very helpful!The mash was delicious with cheddar and mustard - it was flavorful but not overpowering to the other things on my plate. I got it with the Farmer's Gravy which was red wine, onion, smoked bacon, and mushrooms. It was delicious - I thought it was going to be way too much sauce to the rest of the food when it came out but it was perfect and I ate all of it.The London Smokey sausage was also great - a bit on the smaller side but it was fine since I had the Chicken, Bacon, and Leek pie which was delicious. The size wasn't huge but it was fine with all the rest of the heavy meal. I'd say it was the size of smoke alarm detector (or Nest Thermostat if you've seen it). I loved everything about the meal - it was comforting, indulgent, and delicious and had a nice variety of things I could try without it being really expensive. The only downside is that it's not a healthy meal at all, but if you want to splurge or try British food without it being gross, this is a good place to come. They do serve 2 salads, but really, if you want salad- just go to a salad place instead. I'd come back here again!",

My bangers were very spicy and the potatoes, which we both got, \u00a0were made with onions (slightly too much) and cabbage. You order your base of potato style, add your protein and gravy or opt for a pie version. Reasonable London prices. The staff was helpful on an as-needed basis. Odd set up in that the kitchen was downstairs so the staff had to keep running up and down. All drinks in bottles, (very few fountain locations in London) then again most people seem to drink beer with their meals (were we the only ones ever ordering soft drinks?). Good solid choice.",

I'm a small and skinny girl already, I can't imagine how it must feel for others who are not petite. Service was prompt and our dishes came out pretty fast. I had the Champ Mash (Traditional Irish mash with milk, butter, cheddar cheese and spring onions) with Aberdeen Angus Steak pie and Farmer's gravy (Red wine, onion, smoked bacon and mushrooms). The steak pie with the gravy was delicious and the addition of spring onions in mash was something new to me. I didn't think spring onions would work, but it did! My bf had the butternut squash and goats cheese pie and he claims it wasn't bad either. Overall, great quality food and a good place to go for a quite bite that won't hurt your wallet.",

    "text": "If you want to have the best meat pie experience then you must, and I mean must, visit Mother Mash. It is located in a pretty lively area of London surrounded by dozens of shops, bars and restaurants. We arrived at Mother Mash pretty early in the day, a little before noon, and there was no one in the restaurant when we got there. We opted to sit at one of the two outside tables and enjoyed the free wifi so we could check emails and iMessages from back in the states.The menu is a funky version of a create your own kind of thing. You choose the style of potatoes, the meat, and the sauce...YUM ! I stuck with the traditional version and within five minutes of finishing the dish, I was tempted to order one to go; it is a pretty good deal for your money. Compared to being able to grab cheap lunch in the states at plenty of places, grabbing cheap lunch that is good in London is a pretty hard job. And Mother Mash gives you a filling lunch for around 8 pounds.",

    "text": "They don't make any bones about what they serve here. They serve mash pies or sausages with mashed potatoes and gravy--that's basically it. So, if you're looking for variety...look elsewhere. But if you're looking for some good ol' British comfort food, look no further. The ordering process is easy:Step 1: Pick your mash (choose from about a half dozen options)Step 2: Pick your sausage or pie (about 10-12 options, including a special of the day for each)Step 3: Pick your gravy (again choose from about a half dozen options)That's it, and that's all. I've been to Mother Mash a couple times now, and although I was underwhelmed on the first occasion, I gave it another shot and was pleased with my second experience. I think I had high hopes for one of the specials the first time, and instead went with something a bit more classic the second. \u00a0I had the chicken, ham and leek pie with classic mash and traditional gravy. It wasn't bursting with flavor (although that's England for you), but what flavor it had was good. There was about twice as much mash as I needed, and couple of people in my group actually took their leftovers to make a second meal out of them, so all in all a good value for what you get. It's tucked away near Liberty department store (Oxford Circus station is the nearest Tube). Quite a nice little find.",

I ordered the 'beef and Guinness' sausages \u00a0with mash (that was mashed and not bashed as there is this option too - love that!). For pudding (sticking to the typical \"English\" lingo) - apple crumble and custard (sorry there is no photo for this as it was too yummy I forgot). Highly recommend going here, can't believe it's existed so long and I didn't even know it was there (great location in Carnaby Street).",

There were 2 servers who seemed extremely busy, running around this small shop constantly. Still, we were seated, order taken, water glasses filled, without delay.The menu is simple, pick your pie or pick a sausage and a mash. I had the steak and ale pie, my boyfriend had bangers and mash. I also got a heaping side of caramelized onions (my favorite thing ever) SO SO GOOD. Great flavor, the gravy on the mash was amazing. Price was pretty good too.

It was all amazing, the farmer's gravy especially so. I cannot recommend it enough. For dessert I opted for a sticky toffee pudding with custard, also mind-numbingly good. The restaurant itself is cute and casual. At first I was a little unnerved by the high booths, but once I figured out there was a bar underneath to rest your feet on all was right with the world. Service was good, and if you don't go crazy with the ordering like I did (there was some alcohol purchased in addition to the delicious eats) it's very easy to dine for under \u00a310.If I ever have the opportunity to go back to London, Mother Mash will definitely be on my must visit list!",

    "text": "I really wanted a meat pie on this trip to London so I searched and decided to try Mother Mash. Tucked away off a quaint street one street parallel to the busy and bustling Oxford street, I was really excited to try this place.My friend and I walked in for a late lunch, and were seated immediately. It wasn't too busy but the space itself is quite small but not cramped at all. I really loved the way the menu works - it gives a variety of options where you can choose one item each from each of three columns: Mash, Bangers or Meat Pie, and Gravy.I chose Cramp Mash (Irish mash with milk, butter, cheddar cheese, and spring onions), Steak and Ale Pie (the special of the day), and Farmer's Gravy (red wine, onion, smoked bacon, and mushrooms).My friend got the Cheesy Mustard Mash (mash with mature cheddar and whole grain mustard), Cumberland sausage, and Farmer's Gravy.The highlight for this meal was definitely the potatoes. Both our mashes were so delicious but I think we both would agree that the Cheesy Mustard Mash was our favorite because of the sharp flavor and texture the whole grain mustard added to the dish. It tasted like our favorite German potato salad and the sharpness of the mustard and the cheddar made the dish actually feel lighter, which made it easier to continue eating.The meat pie and sausages were good but the mashes were for sure the stars. The gravy as well was delicious and complimented everything well. It made a great sauce for the side vegetables we ordered.We also had the sticky toffee pudding with custard and really enjoyed the gooey warm dessert. I would say that it was on the sweeter end and for this type of dessert, I think if I were to order it again, I would have opted instead to eat the pudding with ice cream to cut the sweetness a bit as the custard didn't do that as much.",

    "text": "I've had bangers and mash in the states, and always wondered how much they actually resemble the real deal in London, well I found out. Of course both the British and American versions have mashed potatoes, sausages and gravy, but that's were the similarities end. The flavor of true bangers and mash can't be had in the State at least not that I have found. Mother Mash is my new home away from home.Picture it. Eight different types of mash, from horseradish, cheesy mustard and of course the classic with milk and butter. Then there are nine different types of bangers you can select from. (Yes this is build your own) from Cumberland sausages, Lincolnshire to lamb and mint, and yes for you vegetarians out there they have a vegetable and herb banger! And it doesn't stop there. Once you select your mash and bangers then you get to choose your gravy, from traditional to veggie and everywhere in between.I selected the horseradish mash with Cumberland sausages and tradition gravy. From the first bite until the very last I was in doggy heaven. Word cannot describe the flavors and textures of this dish. The potatoes are whipped to a fluffy consistency mixed with a fresh horseradish sauce and bits of the horseradish root. The sausages are mild, and tangy and blend perfectly with the traditional gravy. If it hadn't been for a full house, I literally would have licked my plate clean, that's how insanely good this dish was.I don't know how other restaurants prepare their bangers and mash, but at Mother Mash's that all they do, and they have perfected the art, and yes I now know that true bangers and mash is an art form.With love from my dog bowl to yours...Shata",

I got the Irish mash with cheddar and onions, the chicken and leek pie and the traditional sauce. \u00a0It was heavy, so I wish I had tried another sauce and got some sausage instead of the filled pie, but it was still good! \u00a0I got to try the farmer's gravy from my husband's plate, and boy did that have flavor! \u00a0His mash was outstanding too. (It was the fried option).Very small shop, very busy, sometimes crowded. In fact, you may be seated elbow to elbow, but as long as you don't make eye contact, then nobody's really there. ;)",

My first time in London and when I asked my friends in the US what to order here, they said \"not the British food\"!They must not have been going to the right places because based on my meal at Mother Mash, I think it's amazing! I ordered Champ, Pork & Chili, Lamb & Mint, and traditional gravy. They even have choices of mashed or bashed (more texture), which I thought was great for those who might not enjoy the texture of baby food.Outstanding! Prices were reasonable for the experience. When visiting London, I would highly recommend eating like a Brit at the place and washing it down w/ a lager --- you won't regret it!",

I ordered Classic mash (made with milk & butter), Mediterranean Roast Veg pie as my main, with a healthy dose of Farmer's gravy poured on (made with red wine, onion, mushroom, & smoked bacon.) In theory, could be a hearty, comforting meal. In reality, I found fault with all three components, unfortunately. I didn't like the flavor of the gravy I chose and the mash didn't have the buttery flavor & creamy texture I was anticipating. The pie was the best part with the pastry being very tasty, but the veggies inside had no substance; there were no whole chunks of veg (you might be able to see how runny the filling is in my picture.) Around \u00a310 for the meal; a good option if you've spent way too many quid shopping in SOHO. Perhaps the veggie sausage is better than the veggie pie...",

I think they have two salads, but Pie/Sausage and mash is their specialty so if that's not what you are looking for, you should go somewhere else. \u00a0They do their best to cater to those with dietary restrictions, although our vegan was quite limited to the dairy free mash, veg and herb sausages, and onion gravy... and none of the desserts were vegan. \u00a0I have now been twice and I think I prefer their sausages and mash to the pie and mash. \u00a0I had the Wild Boar and Apple sausages and they are delicious... they were a special, but I think they should add them as a permanent option on the menu. \u00a0More recently I had the steak pie... \u00a0it was good, but the pie crust was a bit chewy rather than flaky and buttery. \u00a0I wonder if it just needed a longer bake. \u00a0I am partial to the Colcannon Mash (even as a lactard), but you'll probably need a mint afterward!Another reason to go with the sausages is that they offer a number of fruit pies for dessert... double pie sounds like a recipe for disaster. \u00a0I haven't had the pie, but the students seem to enjoy it. \u00a0I had their sticky toffee pudding and it is delicious and for those worried about the coffee in it (mentioned on the menu), you can't taste it. \u00a0It is simply there to enhance the flavour (I use a bit of coffee when baking chocolate cake because it seems to make it taste more chocolate-y). \u00a0I will say that the Ginger Pudding is almost always out... it is quite popular, so you may want to have a back up option just in case.The staff are always happy to accommodate us, but I will say that if you have a really large group: \u00a01) you need to book ahead and 2) you won't all be able to sit at the same table as most of the tables seat between 2 and 4, with one table for 6 (or 8 really small people). \u00a0We did have an issue with a larger student having trouble sitting in one of the booths... so do be warned. \u00a0There are tables with chairs that pull out at the front of the restaurant, but all the seating at the back is booth style. \u00a0Definitely good value for money.",

    "text": "Really surprised at the good reviews for this place. The best word to describe this place is Overpriced... 10 pounds for pie and mash is easily the most I paid of the several times I had pie/mash on my trip. But the thing is the quality didn't justify the price. The pie was especially average. I think the worst pie of my trip. The meat was on the dry side. The mash was pretty good, but not fantastic. Given the location and price, I think that this place targets tourists (in fact it seemed to be mainly tourists when I visited). Get your pie/mash at a pub... better atmosphere/ better price/ better taste.",

    "text": "I seldom have a craving for such fatty, filling, stodgy English food, but last week was an exception. Mother mash is a small unassuming restaurant which serves traditional English fare with a gastro pub-feel. Conveniently located in Soho, this would be great for an autumnal dinner to recover from Oxford/Regent street shopping. There is ample seating inside and a couple of tables outside. The menu is simple but good. Bangers and mash or pie and mash. Choose your pie or bangers, choose your mash. The cheesy mustard mash looked particularly interesting. I went for the vegetarian butternut squash pie with sweet potato mash and onion gravy. For about a tenner, a filling meal though not too stodgy, the pie was very tasty and service was pretty quick. My friend got a meaty option and also really enjoyed it.Friendly service, quite loud, I would come back.",

    "text": "Popped into Mother Mash for a quick dinner on a Tuesday evening. \u00a0The place was pretty full with a lively atmosphere. \u00a0Such a charming location in Carnaby Market. \u00a0It's pretty small, with about 4-5 booths in the back and a few 2-4 seater tables in front. \u00a0It has about 4-6 tables outside too. \u00a0The menu is very simple and is divided into 4 categories. \u00a0First you pick your style of mash, then your sausage or pie then your gravy. \u00a0Then you add any sides you wish. \u00a0My husband and I weren't that hungry, so we decided to split a meal. \u00a0We went with cheesy mash, steak pie, traditional gravy and a side of baked beans. \u00a0The mash was super creamy with a great hint of cheddar cheese. \u00a0The pie was great, with a warm flaky crust and a savory steak filling. \u00a0Gravy was good - not great. And the beans were good - again, not great, just plain. \u00a0We both thought the meal was great, just heavy on the salt! \u00a0We left very thirsty as everything was very high in sodium. \u00a0Great flavors, I'd just take it back a notch in the salt department. Overall, we were very pleased. \u00a0The best part is the price. \u00a0Our total was \u00a311! \u00a0The portions were very generous and if we weren't splitting, there was no way I could finish a meal on my own. \u00a0It was a fun place to try and is a great affordable option for the area!",

In an effort to embrace the more local cuisine rather than that of east Asia, I decided to find a place that had a predominantly English/British menu, which lead me to Mother Mash. This restaurant is tucked away from the bustling shopping streets on a pedestrian-only street. Its a nice little restaurant with a few tables outside on the street. I came at about 4PM on a weekday so it was practically empty. I sat at the small bar seating facing the window and looked at the menu. It's a formula-style menu- choose one from column A, column B, and column C. The first column being style of mashed potatoes, then your type of sausage or pie, and the type of gravy. I really wanted to try their sweet potato mash but it was unavailable so I went for the cheesy mash with the angus steak pie and farmer's gravy. My food came out quite quickly and the first thing I noticed is that the presentation was quite nice. A nice surprise for such an affordable restaurant! I dug right in.The cheesy potatoes were even cheesier than I expected. They were almost sticky with cheese. The steak pie was nice and meaty, and paired well with the tangy, meaty flavor of the farmer's gravy. Everything went together nicely, and I can imagine that almost every menu combination would come out great. Service was alright- nothing much to say about it either way. The price for the meal is very reasonable and the serving was quite substantial. While I'm sure that even better British fare could be found elsewhere, this is a hearty, tasty meal to have if you're in the area.",

There's not an awful lot of room to go wrong. With bench cubby seating, I can imagine on the weekends this little place gets quite busy but is a lot bigger than you may initially believe when walking past. So I don't think there would be much trouble finding yourself a cosy little spot to fill your belly.The menu has a wide range of different sausages and pies, even enough to keep a keen vegetarian happy - they offer veggie gravy too - along with an inventive selection of mashed potatoes. Just one word of advise, if you're not the kind of person who loves baby paste textured mash, ask for it with a bit more texture. They can do this for you no problem, but it's worth remembering to ask! All in all, it's a great little place for a hearty meal, piping hot and definitely a British home comfort.",

It's a one dish meal consisting of mashed potatoes, sausage or meat pie, and gravy. I got the mashed potatoes with cabbage, lamb stew pie, and onion gravy. We also ordered the steak and Guinness sausage with farmer's gravy, pork and cider pie with farmer's gravy, Angus steak pie with mashed sweet potatoe in a regular gravy. Highly recommend the mashed sweet potato for something different-creamy and lightly sweet but balanced with the savory gravy. The pork and cider pie had very good flavors while my dad said the Guinness steak sausage was a little tough. We also ordered a side of French green beans which were well made but such a small handful. The restaurant itself is small and narrow with a couple of outdoor seating. Inside it's diner car seating style with wooden benches with a marble tabletops. Fun artwork decorate the bright white walls. It can get a little warm in there but rooftop windows are open to let whatever breeze can get in on a warm British summer. All in all, I recommend this place if you want to try some good traditional English food.",

Mother Mash is definitely one of those places that does not necessarily define British food but does graze over a few of their known dishes. I ordered their CHEESY MUSTARD MASH, with a CHICKEN, LEEK, & BACON PIE. The crust was perfectly made, and the inside was just as creamy/ delicious. After our main dishes we could not help ourselves to a bit of something sweet. For dessert we had the APPLE CRUMBLE. Great dessert! A bit on the sweet side from what I like, but still enjoyable. I had to give the restaurant 3 stars, because instead of telling us in the beginning what they were out of, we ordered, and the waitress would come back and say \"Oh, we don't have it.\" There was a lot of back and forth, and we had to ask for water 3 times before we actually got it. Overall, the restaurant was good, and I highly recommend checking this restaurant out. ENJOY!",

There were 2 other people already waiting to place their orders in. We said cool! It has to be good! But nope. We were seated by indifferent manager who later asked if we minded that their staff had a meeting as they rolled in. We didn't, but when we ordered, she didn't even know my pie was unavailable until they were about to serve us. Someone else came to tell me something was not available, so I went for the Mediterranean vegetable pie. 5 mins later my husband got his steak and ale pie plus mash, and I got my pie with mash. Food was tasteless and bland except for the gravy. Pies were obviously leftovers and reheated. Aaaaaand my husband saw one of the waitresses wrapping silverware drop a fork in the floor- and wrap it back into a napkin for service!!I've gone to hole in the wall joints with better food. Avoid this place - there are sooooo many better options in the area.",

It was drowned in gravy which I LOVED and finished all of! It was fun to be able to choose the type of mash, sausage and gravy (build your own mash kind of thing). This was the same for the pies as well. They were really busy on a Sunday evening, but there was a table available so we were seated immediately. We wanted to sit on the patio but they were full so we sat inside. The sausages were flavourful and getting the pork and chilli sausage added that extra kick to it. I can't wait to come back for some mash the next time I'm in London.",

Honestly, we wanted to go to Dishoom down the street, but I am so happy we ended up here!The staff here are extremely efficient and friendly! I believe I saw one guy taking orders and seating people all with a smile. I ordered the champ mash with London smokeys and my boyfriend ordered the cheesy mash with the traditional minced beef pie. Both were so flavorful and seasoned just right. I wish I had gotten a beer or something because this is the perfect food for that! The portions were also perfect for sharing. After, we decided to get the sticky pudding and it did not disappoint! I wasn't expecting too much, but left extremely satisfied and craving more!",

The BF had the cheesy mash with the angus steak pie with traditional gravy. We both really enjoyed our meals and felt that the price was worth the portion of food.

My boyfriend ordered the horseradish mash with onion gravy and pork chili bangers. I also got the red berries cider.If you like very sweet drinks, the cider would be your thing. It was basically juice. The mash portion was huge and each dish came with two sausages.The bangers and mash did not disappoint, although we didn't have any expectations. The cost came out to \u00a314.20 per order (main dish + beer) which seems fair. I can't speak to its authenticity but I would recommend this place!

The mix & match menu makes it fun and easy for people to try all sorts of combinations. I got a Bubbles & Squeak with Aberdeen Angus Steak & Farmers gravy on top, while my dining partner got a Warm Sausage salad. Both were big portions, and overall pretty good. I was definitely surprised by the generous portion of the salad - to the point that we were unable to finish the sausage. The greens were a welcome lightness to go with the heavier mash meal. Service was friendly and attentive. My big complaint with the restaurant was that in the back area the tables and chairs had to be the most uncomfortable set up I have ever encountered in my life - They were just high enough to leave everybody's feet dangling, ramrod straight back wooden bench booths, and the two-top tables were crazy crammed to the point that while sitting there, you would have the table practically jammed into your chest and abdomen. I seriously considered taking another star off for this horrible set up.",

I got the bubble and squeak with lamb and mint sausage and veggie gravy. The bubble and squeak is a must, it's like mashed potatoes but fried on two sides so you get a crispy layer of buttery mash. The sausages were delicious, i got an extra third sausage because they messed up on something and gave me the extra!My friends and I ended on the sticky toffee pudding with custard, and it was the most delightfully rich bite ever.",

I had the Aberdeen steak pie and it was just tender and meaty. \u00a0Usually pies are leaves you empty when you open the pie up, but this one was bursting with meat.All in all, comforting for being our last night in good o' Blighty. Will be back soon for more mash!Service was good and waitress was attentive. \u00a0 My son dropped his lamb and mint sausage under the table and she replaced it for him. \u00a0He was happy he got to eat because he wasn't having any of MINE!Centrally located in Soho (to be precise, within Carnaby Street)",

We originally walked here on our first full day in London, only to find out that they had maintenance issues and were closed. Thus, we walked back on our last night in London and had an early dinner. I wanted the bubble and squeak, but they were actually out. Our server recommended the colcannon as a respectable substitute. So I ordered the colcannon with the premium pork and onion gravy. My goodness was it good. Mash is perfect for a cold winter's day. It's flavorful, hearty, and chock full of all the right ingredients that is a dieter's nightmare. I love that you can mix and match your own mash, sausage, and gravy. Would come back here in a heartbeat. The ultimate feel-good food!",

    "text": "Thanks Yelp for recommending this place! My American boyfriend was visiting and wanted to sample some 'real British' pie, sausage and mash, so we looked up the reviews and picked out this place together, as the glowing comments sounded promising. I was a little apprehensive as my only experience of sausage and mash was watery, pale school dinners, so naturally I didn't quite share his excitement. We arrived at 5pm on a Monday with the place to ourselves and were seated in one of the little cubbyhole booths - I imagine this place would be so cramped when it gets busy, as there isn't that much space! Staff seemed friendly and polite enough and we were served promptly with no issues at all. I did like the 'pick-and-mix' style of the menu, allowing you to pick and choose your mash, main and gravy for a brilliantly custom experience. There are a generous number of vegetarian options, so any non-meat-eater definitely won't feel left out. I decided to go for cheesy mash, Lincolnshire sausage and traditional gravy, whilst my boyfriend opted for the same but with an Aberdeen Angus pie in addition to sausages, with mushy peas on the side (we were so hungry after walking around London all day). The food was everything I could have hoped for and more, a far cry from the grey dinner hall mashed potato and sausage! Mash was creamy and delicious, the sausages and gravy were flavourful, and I could have easily had more (although my portion was just enough for me). My boyfriend is a huge foodie and can be very critical of what he eats (not to mention spoiled for choice at home) - he said it was incredible and his favourite meal of the trip. Saying a lot, as we'd had some truly excellent other food that I assumed couldn't be beat! We decided to skip dessert as it would've been too much, paying less than \u00a330 between us, very reasonable for such a great restaurant meal right in the middle of London.I'd absolutely recommend Mother Mash to anyone else looking for some incredible and very British pie and mash in the middle of London - I promise you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I love this place's food, but it's so hard to give this place 4 stars as so many things went wrong.If you want to try really good food that you can probably get in a pub, come here! And more significantly, if you are a vegetarian and have always wanted to try a savory pie and mash, run here! However, no matter how fast you run, the service might move at a pace slow enough to induce one's hangry alter ego.I had the cheddar mash with a special sausage (lamb and honey mustard) with traditional gravy and my vegetarian girlfriend had traditional mash with the Mediterranean veggie savory pie and the vegetarian gravy. Both were excellent.Now on to the negatives...There were 3 or 4 groups (one was a party of 7) in this fairly small establishment that had 2 servers. all of the groups got there at different times and it should have been manageable. It took more than 10 or 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and greet us... And they kept coming by mouthing \"one second\" and then continuing to provide service to tables that had already been helped. It seemed like a mismanagement of how to engage with customers because tasks like distributing silverware if the meal is not yet ready seem like they should be delayed to greet new customers.Anyhow... We finally got our order in and it took quite a long time to receive drinks. All of this is not enough to warrant 3 stars, as I really do like the food and I think this is forgivable... But the peculiar thing is what unfolded next.As the party of 7 received their food, I said to my girlfriend \"it must be difficult to know what dish belongs to what person since the pies and mash all look the same\" and then 3 people at that table were given the wrong orders! Then my girlfriend was given an incorrect pie in her order... Luckily it was still vegetarian, but they were kind and replaced it... But then the tables in front and behind us both had messed up orders! How does that happen 4 times in a row? Id be careful ordering takeout here... This was our second time coming to mother mash and we loved the food both times. The service the second time made the experience feel like a third, decisive visit is required some time in the future.",

    "text": "On the recommendation of some Local Guides we decided to stop here for a quick bite before going out for the evening. All in all? If you want pie and mash then it's a pretty good place to come. (They also do sausages) I ordered the cheddar mash with the steak pie and the traditional gravy with a side of cauliflower cheese. The pie had quite a lot of filling (always a bonus), the gravy was tasty and the mash was really flavourful too. They do offer the option of 'smooth' or normal mashed potato. I went with smooth and do wish that I had gone with the other option as it was just a little too pureed for my liking. I didn't really rate the cauliflower cheese. In terms of decor and comfort, it is pretty much a fast food place and you're not going to spend a lot of time here but for a quick, filling bite on a cold evening? It's pretty good.",

I'd heard all the rumors about British food being awful. Mother Mash totally broke that stereotype! The restaurant is small, but they were able to host our entire group with two small tables to spare. Our food was brought out promptly. \u00a0They had a vegetarian meat pie for me! Yum! It was the perfect portion. The mash was smooth, comforting and paired well with the flaky \"meat\" pie. The gravy wasn't too salty but more than what I'd usually pour on my mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed my dinner at Mother Mash and I'm happy that our tour group took us to local places instead of the cookie cutter tour restaurants. You know I'll be back when I'm in London!",

The food was really good, nice portion size, not too massive, which was a relief. Pies and Sausages are there in full force and they taste a-ok.Wine was drinkable and ok for the price. Service was speedy and attentive. So no probs there.But alas, the seating was something pulled out of the deck of an Edwardian Steam Liner. Wooden and with only enough space for people of an average waist size. To our fuller friends you may want to give MM a miss to avoid the embarrassment of being unable to squeeze into the booths.

We went early around 12.30, because it gets really busy and managed to bag a tiny little booth, where we all squished in. You can choose what type of mash to have for instance: Classic, Champ, Cheese and what type of sausages (two per serving): Pork & Leek, Beef & Ale, Lincolnshire, Lamb & Mint and what type of gravy: Classic, Onion Gravy, Farmers Gravy. You can also have extra sausages (\u00a31.60 each) or a side of mushy peas, garden peas, caramelised onions for \u00a31.50. Bear in mind, this menu is the condensed version off the top of my head!We all ordered sausages and mash, though we can get it to take-away and you get salads too. And the food was cleaned off our plates within 10 mins. The food was really really good, though service was a bit odd, as we were seated really quickly but then it took a while for someone to come over and take orders for drinks and food, then when Martin asked for the dessert menu but Nico asked for the bill, we got the bill quicker than the dessert menu. But it was the lunch hour so it's forgivable. You should come here when you want a good hearty warm meal to fill you up and if it's raining outside, even better as they have a skylight at the back so you can see the rain but be cosy inside with yummy food in your stomach.",

I have never really been a fan of mash (probably because of the lumpy variety served at school!) but this place has converted me. The relaxed cafe style interior with wooden booth seats is ideal for enjoying classical British mash with either sausage or pies.It is a simple concept Mother Mash serve either mash and sausage for \u00a36.95 or mash and pie for \u00a37.95. There is a wide selection of mash including classic, cheesy and cheesy mustard. If none of those sound tempting you can actually create your own mash from a range of ingredients including olive oil, salad cream and pesto. There is also a good range of sausages, pies and even gravy. They serve alcohol although I've always been too tempted by the traditional lemonade and ginger beer.If you have room for dessert (I doubt it) try one of their old fashioned stodgy treats such as sticky toffee pudding and chocolate pudding. If you steer clear from carbohydrates Mother Mash would be hell but for me it's perfect for comforting carb heaven.",

Thankfully we snagged the last available table. My sister was very excited, because she's a vegetarian and they had many veggie options. The menu is is simple. You choose which mash you'd like, pie or sausage, and finally the gravy that will go with it. There are quite a few options for each category. I chose the traditional Irish mash, with a steak pie, and traditional gravy. My veggie sis got the cheese mash, butternut squash pie, and onion gravy. By the end we both wanted to lick our plates clean! The service was pretty great too, our waitress was very nice and attentive. Prices were also awesome! I had a cider and she had a juice plus our meals, and we spent less than $30 in total. Breakfast was super delicious. I had the traditional English breakfast and my sis had the veggie breakfast. Those mushrooms were the best thing ever! Thankfully my sis doesn't like mushrooms so I got eat hers too, muhaha. The little potato cake is so amazing. Really glad we had our traditional English b-fast experience here!",

It took us couple turns we finally found the restaurant. Well, tell you a easier way to find it, when you pass the alley that which lots of light bulbs between the building then you know you are in the right place.The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but we came for the food anyway. We picked a seat outside, it didn't take long the waitress already with us. I was kind of new to this food. They also got a interesting was for ordering, basically you can DIY want you like to have on your dish, quite a fresh idea. I did ask the waitress she recommend me some stuff. I sort of forgot the name by now. It was something with premium sausages. Well, like I said, it was a DIY set. I really like how it tasted. It was really different and I like it a lot, I also ordered a Ginger beer, nice drink as well. My hubby also enjoyed his ordered as well, which it was good, usually he isn't a fan of British cuisine. The generally cost wasn't so high here as well and we like the location. The stuff were really friendly as well. If you're also looking for something local food to try out, this might be the place for this.",

    "text": "HEADS UP TOURISTS! THIS PLACE IS YOUR JAM!I arrived to London and with anguish saw that most of the top rated restos in the city don't serve up the 'typical British cuisine' one is looking to sample as they're touring about. Thankfully I chanced upon Mother Mash and can now depart London confident that I have had a taste of the local cuisine. I love how the menu is set-up; (1) choose your mash, (2) chose your pie and (3) chose your gravy. There were tons of veggie options at each step which was really fantastic. The waitress was sweet and quick to guide us \"pie & mash rookies\". The food came out quickly and really was fantastic. I got the cheese & mustard mash which had an amazing kick to it! The Mediterranean vegetable pie was flavourful and perfectly cooked (I was worried the insides would be soggy or mushy but they were perfection). It was all topped off with the onion gravy which wasn't too strong and paired well with my pie and mash choices. i ended my meal with ginger bread and custard which could have been a little sweeter. I would recommend going with the ice cream rather than the custard. I was feeling adventurous with the custard but it wasn't particularly to my taste - perhaps a little too authentic for a foreigner. Anyways all of this is to say that if you want to try some proper pie and mash I would seriously recommend this spot! It's not far from Oxford Circus and will really hit the spot!",

    "text": "THIS is the place I take people from out of town. The great thing about Mother Mash is it's soooooo British (isn't it? Or am I confused? To me it is anyways) because it's got all the stuff- mashed potatoes, peas, bubbles and squeak, sausage, pies, beer...etc. and it tastes WONDERFUL. There's those pubs that serve all those things but the food is only sub-par but people go there because it's British. Mother Mash serves excellent food and the menu is really cool because you can customize it the way you like. First you pick your mash- they've got a wide variety between mashed taters with horseradish, mustard, bubbles and squeak (veggies), sweet potato...etc. \u00a0And then you pick your main- a wide selection of sausages and pies (vegetarian options for both), and then your sauce. It's wonderful! The location is equally wonderful- in Carnaby Court right off Regent Street. We've been here a few times and the wait staff is always great.I go vegetarian and I think it's delicious- the bubbles and squeak and horseradish mash is my favorite, and the veggie sausage or goat cheese pie are winners.",

Service is attentive and the food came out pretty fast.I had the sweet potato mash and opted for the angus steak pie with the farmer's gravy. This was my first time having this type of food. It was really filling, especially for a cold night like this. My bf had three different kinds of sausages and they were super tasty. The sweet potato went well with the farmer's gravy. It wasn't too sweet and more savory. The pie crust was crispy on top and then still held up decently as it soaked in the gravy. The steak was okay tasting, it kind of got lost in the gravy and sweet potato though.Portion sizes are decent and I felt good leaving. They do have desserts and sides you can always add as well as the usual tea, OJ and apple available.",

The servers are very nice and the service is quick. You pick your mash, your pie, and then your gravy and you are done! We enjoyed the Angus steak pie with our champ mash along with the green beans wrapped in bacon. All the food was prepared with seasonings and flavor beyond my expectations. The server made a mistake on my type of mash potatoes and promptly fixed it with no issue. We also had their bottled cidar. The berry flavored cidar was amazing! The apple pie was so yummy with the ice cream and was large enough for us to share as it came as a small pie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. This place is not great are large groups as the space is small and seating is tight. Also, they ran out of several desserts on the menu and it was only 830PM. I loved this food at a tourist being able to have traditional food during our stay was important. The Angus was tender, and had a lot of flavor along with sauce in the pie. Be prepared to eat alot of carbs if eating here but it will be well worth the carb overload!!",

We were told they were closed already, I protested and said they listed their hours until 10. \u00a0The waitress said she would check with the kitchen and then returned with menus and said we could order but only if we did it quickly! While the waitress stood at the end of the table and a man, who I assume was cook, glared at us with contempt we scanned the menu, ordered the special of the day, one cheesy mash with with sausages, one with smoked sausages and a lamb pie. We asked that the gravy be put on the side on all orders. Our orders arrived fairly quickly and we noticed right away every order was covered in gravy, when we reminded her we ordered it on the side she just said \"yeah, the cook got it wrong.\" as she put the dishes on the table. We did not see her again until she brought the bill, no water refills, no offer of desert......and it was 10:10 when we paid. Oh yeah, the food, it was good, not great, but the horrible service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. My suggestion, skip this place, there are some really good spots with much better food and service in the area.",

First, I love how the menu was set up, but still needed guidance putting it together (disclaimer number two: I was really, really sick with a cold, which does funny things to your appetite, your taste buds and your ability to read a basic menu).Anyway, at MM it's a three-step process in which you pick your mash, your main (sausage or pie) and your gravy. For me, that was cheesy mash, minced beef pie and traditional gravy (I got a nod of approval from my professional London dining mate, so I think I done good and didn't try to mix up some ridiculous American combo).We placed our order at the hallway-sized restaurant (it's a tight squeeze but done well, a cozy atmosphere and modern), and I headed downstairs to use the bathroom (which felt like navigating around a submarine -- seriously that space it tight). By the time I returned, I was surprised to find the food waiting for me. Wait, what? Did that come frozen and re-heated in a microwave?? I hope not (though for the prices I wouldn't be surprised, this place is rather reasonable for its location).The verdict: it was pretty tasty, but I wasn't in love. My dining mate was unpleasantly surprised as well at their too-quick delivery of our food. It was suspect. But he said it was ok, though like myself, was not overly impressed. The only reason I don't give it another star was because I felt sick to my stomach the rest of the day. In fact, I skipped dinner that night due to the stomach ache. This could be due to my aforementioned cold, but my partner didn't feel so hot and skipped dinner that night as well...so, there you have it. Sorry, Mother Mash, I really wanted to love you.",

We wanted the experience of having sausage, mash, and/or pies and knew it would be hard to find. Luckily I found Mother Mash online before we left for London. We got in exactly at noon when lunch started. The waitress was so friendly and wanted to know a lot about us, our travels, and where we were from.My fiancee ordered the cheesy mustard mash with vegetarian sausage and vegetarian gravy. He says it is the best meal he's ever eaten. The vegetarian sausages are huge and definitely homemade.I ordered the cheesy mustard mash with the vegetarian pie and vegetarian gravy. It was the best meal of my life as well. We dream of the day we can go back to Mother Mash. Definitely my top vegetarian pick for London! I'd recommend it to anyone, vegetarian or not.Also, I must mention, the ambiance of this place is great. People were happy, the cider was flowing. Ahh, memories.",

    "text": "This place isn't gourmet- but if your looking for a hearty, warming, meaty portion of sausage and mash then head here. The idea is simple- choose a mash (from 5 options- some with milk and onion, some with cheese, some with bacon...mmm) then choose two sausages- I always mix and match- it doesn't mention this on the menu but they never mind. Then finally what gravy you want- onion, traditional, bacon bit...again. Who cares, you can never have enough bacon!Alternative you can have a pie- I've never had one here before, but always been tempted. Your meal will come to around \u00a39.00, bargain! AND will leave you feeling happy and full. Another bonus is this place serves food quickly, so if you work around Oxford Cirrus you could technically come for your lunch break. Oh and one last thing- a great place to stop and fuel up when you're shopping- Mother Mash is located just off Carnaby Street.",

Mother Mash is a small but lovely restaurant. The Menu isnt large but the food is pretty darn tasty :) We ordered one order of the veggie bangers and mash and one order of the veggie pie with mash. They offer several different types of mash and topping. I tried the horseradish mash and parsley sauce. The veggie pie and bangers were ok, but the best part of the meal was def. the mash. The mash was light, fluffy and full of taste. For me you could really taste the horseradish, which was great!Mother mash is def, worth a shot, the mash is great and the prices are cheap to London standard.

I was expecting to go in and get that look after asking 'table for one', but just as I was about to ask, I noticed someone coming out with a take-away bag! Yippee! Well that alone earnt itself a star! I was pleasently greeted by a member of staff, who described the slightly complex ordering system (not in the sense that it's difficult, but more along the lines of too much choice for a person), and made my decision.I ordered a sausage meal: Cumberland sausage, mash with cabbage and spring onion & a classic onion gravy. When I opened the box, I was somewhat dissatisfied. I expected a Cumberland ring sausage (or at least that's what I liked the idea of), and another gripe was amount of mash given, for a greedy pig like me I would have liked a little bit more. However, the food tasted great! The sausages could have been cooked a bit more for my liking, but the mash was just right, not crazy creamy, but this wasn't the crown holder, this belonged to the gravy. They got it just right, not too thick, not salty at all, and bits of onion too.All in all I can say that Mother Mash provided more than just a service, this in which made the experience much better, and therefore will most def be back for more, only next time I think I'll have to ask for double portions!!Get yourselves down the for some good ol' British grub!",
