The food is great, and the fact that it is cooked in an open style kitchen gives it a very homely vibe.I went a few months ago, around the time when the conflict broke out in Georgia. Being an authentic Georgian restaurant, the majority of people there, both staff and customers seemed to be quite anxious as a result of the conflict. This did not affect the service however, and it was nice to be in an environment where people were supporting each other, all the while maintaining a hospitable manner towards the customers.The restaurant is not licensed and you are allowed to bring your own drinks. I really recommend going as it is a bona fide Georgian experience.",

I'm not sure they actually knew what they were talking about, but okay. \u00a0One girl was boasting about reading in the shower as a child because she didn't have much time to read (don't know why this was as she seemed to have grown up in an upper middle class Jewish home in New Jersey), and wanted to take every opportunity to read. \u00a0First of all, how does one read in the shower? \u00a0with laminated pages? Secondly, this story was a blatant attempt to appear like a nerd, but sadly for the story teller, had the opposite effect due to the basic chemistry of the situation. \u00a0The best part of this conversation was when her fellow diners (who, being Danish and more direct, did not understand the American mannerism of politely accommodating when a person fishes for compliments) actually probed her on how exactly she was able to accomplish this ---seeing the flaw in her clearly fabricated story, she resorted to a non-answer and silly girly giggling. \u00a0As an American, I found this conversation embarrassing to listen to.Sadly, I don't think I will be coming back.",

Lighting is lovely. There are little tables outside for watching the world go by on summer evenings, and large tables downstairs for party groups. You can bring your own wine which is not subject to a corking fee, plus the bills tend to be ridiculously cheap.Oh yes, and the food is amazing, homey, comforting and different. Try the hachapuri - bread pockets filled with a soft, flavoursome cheese - or the lobiani, or any of the beetroot-flavoured dishes. One slight and very gentle criticism? I tend to stick to sharing a couple of starters or a mezze rather than order the mains as I have never found them particularly inspiring. But apart from that, absolutely nothing.",

You'd swear Shorediytch started at Roman Road or the back of Vicky park now that it is so uber trendy! But I digress; Little Georgia is one of the best places to eat in London. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are FANTASTIC! The menu changes every few weeks and sometimes they run out of things but all of it is handmade. Children are welcome and they have two tables outside. Georgian is not like Russian is it is far healthier with yoghurt instead of sour creams and loads of fresh fruit and veggies. Everything is made to order so be patient and tip well because they work hard. Also one of the best places to get coffee in the East End. (Don't try ordering over the phone unless you want comedy instead of placing an order though.)",

    "text": "Seems most people have gone for dinner here, but yesterday I decided to stray from the standard Saturday fried eggs and bacon and hit up some - at least partly - Caucasus breakfast.Little Georgia is a little like going into an eastern bloc family kitchen - a battered gramophone and cryptic Georgian maps perch on the wall, strains of Central European music drift from the counter - while mother and daughter toil in the back, rustling up traditional dishes for their customers.You are greeted with the same gruff decorum as a member of the family, and the food definitely has a homely feel to it. Spicy, tomatoey scrambled eggs nestle around homemade herb sausages, a heap of rustic, herb-infused beans and bacon in their signature dish 'Chizi Bhizi' (sounds a little like some kind of saucy prohibition-era dance to me). Despite the strange name, this really is a delicious worker's collective combo that knocks the socks off some of the greasier breakfast options available.Coffee comes in viscous and strong, and certainly kick starts your morning, and the only thing that I missed when I was there was a try of the pancakes with yogurt and fruit that the people next to me were having.So, in short it's a quaintly different - and reasonable - place to go and get away from the throng of Broadway Market, have some great food served by suitably abrupt staff and revel in the spartan tweeness that oozes from the well worn interior.",

The atmosphere is charming, like a cozy house, reminding us of Brooklyn in the best way. also, def not expensiveTwo notes: if you're coming from hackney (say, via the 55 bus), note that at the intersection of hackney and goldsmith, the sign for goldsmith's row is erased.

The borscht was divine - I have been dreaming about it for weeks. Definitely get the appetizer sampler - all the dips are unique and delicious. And the cheese bread??? Heaven!!I went for the beef stew entree and it was dreamy. There was something minty going on, which was a nice element to the flavor \u00a0My husband went for the chicken, and it was okay, but not my favorite. We got a cheesecake dessert that was ok but they ruined it a little with some overly sweet raspberry sauce. Would have been better as is. Breakfast pastries are super yummy and they do a nice coffee. Ambience is cozy and homey - very cute. The service is spotty but very sweet, and expect some mild miscommunication. It's byob which is great if you're in to that.

You can definitely recognise some Greek influence (Meze platter was delightful) but in a sense, this is even more...kind of \"comfort food\", more heavy. Those meze are generally eaten with local cheesy breads, very good. Those roasted aubergines in tomato sauce, yummy, and so simple.

There are two tables for outside sitting, that were sadly already taken (to be expected on a sunny day). Inside is not a bad place to be, the large windows let in a lot of light \u00a0and I particularly loved the gramophone displayed above the staircase. The service was friendly and the food was filling. I think the day we went they experiencing some complications in the kitchen and as a result, we received our food at different times, which was the minor disappointment.",

Yeah...and only the Yelp sticker...apparently the business owners have good taste.I've never had Georgian food (and my friend was a Georgian-food virgin as well) and so we were both very excited to find out more about it. We ordered from the small-dishes menu: a meat blini and an order of the Georgian Meze. I have to say, the food was not quite what I expected...but not bad, just different. The taste palette is quite different from the usual Chinese/Indian/French/Italian...but well worth the try.The service was a slow, and the waiter was not really a great sales-person, but he was also all by himself and the restaurant was quite packed. Nevertheless, I would have loved to hear a little bit more about Georgian cuisine in general.Will I come back? Yes, because I have to try the main dishes as well.",

They also have a variety of scrambled eggs, and we had the ham and sausage scrambled egg with a side of the ajika (pepper sauce which you MUST order).You can sit outside or indoors (upstairs and downstairs).

Some of the dishes we had were excellent, particularly the cheese bread, blini and mozzarella/aubergine main dish. The meatballs were fine but nothing to write home about. I loved the Georgian themed decoration of the toilets. The fact it's bring your own is a great money saver; the food is not mega cheap (average of about \u00a312-\u00a314 for a main course, \u00a36.50 ish for a starter).",

Since we did not book ahead we were shown a table downstairs. Frankly, I think I preferred downstairs - the tables are bigger and there was plenty of room to settle in, and no one to stop us chatting away.The blini with ground beef was a standout for me especially with its accompaniments: thick, savory yogurt and chopped beets. The generous Georgian mixed meze comes with six different items and a cheese-filled bread; I liked the carrot salad the best. They've also got a big selection of tea.Know before you go: do not expect attentive service, the mixed meze is bountiful and should be ordered, reserve ahead if you want to sit upstairs.",

    "text": "It's time for \"G\" dining! Yes, the next stop of our Around the World in Alphabetical Order dining tour was upon us and I selected Georgia (the country frequently invaded by Russia, not the peachy US state) for this one. And when you are looking for Georgian food, a place called Little Georgia is a pretty good bet.Tucked away just north of Bethnal Green, this is a proper little caf\u00e9-style restaurant serving a simple menu of Georgian classics. There is a standard starter menu of about 8 or so items that really should be treated the same way you would meze or tapas. Order a variety, and order a lot. In fact, you could easily make a meal of those and I'm sure we would have if the mains didn't smell so appetising. When it comes to mains, there were only four on the day and given that they are scrawled colourfully across a chalkboard, I can only assume they change periodically. \u00a0But more on that in a bit.For our first round or two, we dove straight in with a variety of dishes. I have no idea what the Georgian name is (sadly didn't take a photo of the menu) so I'll refer to them by key characteristics - if you go and describe them, I'm sure the staff will figure out what you want. The meat filled blinis are excellent with flavourful tender minced meat wrapped in a thin stretchy blini. LG does blinis to perfection and manage to avoid any stodginess or chewiness too often associated with such a food. Next up, cheesy bread! It combines melted cheese and soft fluffy warm bread - what's not to like? Well, perhaps not for the lactose-intolerant among us although that didn't stop one of our party. It reminds me of home where I used to stop by a bakery every time we went out to the main cities and grab a labneh cheesy bread - so good! The little extra saltiness in the cheese stops this from being overwhelming as it could easily be a very rich dish. Instead, you find yourself craving more and more so definitely order the large portion!Other dishes picked were a spinach pate and a beetroot pate (both tasty but more like veggie dishes than pate strictly speaking), a stuffed pancake type dish filled with more meat (see a trend here?), and the mixed grill. All were tasty but couldn't top the blinis and cheesy bread for pure enjoyment.Hmm...other important stuff. It's BYO so make sure to grab a bottle or two of your favourite stuff before hand. They don't care what you bring (so wine or hard alcohol is fair game) so extra points on that. Unfortunately, there is no off license nearby with the nearest bet being a wine shop and a Co-Op about 10 minutes away. Definitely book ahead - there are only around 15-20 covers tops in this place and it tends to be fairly popular. And if you need place to meet up beforehand, the Albion across the road is a pretty decent pub.I think G-dining was an epic success and Little Georgia will be a place I go back to when I want something different to eat while I catch up with friends. Food is reasonable \u00a0although slightly pricey for the portion size given it's traditional home cooked food.",

Right up the street from Hackney City Farm, this quaint lil' cafe (i.e. unlicensed) provides hearty fare at a reasonable price. The only gotcha to the place is that it is shut on Mondays but besides that the food is great. Loved the mixed mezze which included assorted spicey salads from red cabbage to spinach and also included hachapuri bread (filled with cheese). The follow up main of bean casserole with smoked sausage was also great and gone in no time at all! If you want to get a table, you have to book, so don't imagine you can turn up and snag a quick meal. Definitely worth the jaunt up from Old Street or elsewhere and feel free to get totally stuffed :)",
