Matcha latte - the first latter was lack of matcha taste, then i asked to put more matcha powder, which was better, but not best. I would suggest to come here only for the dessert, as the green tea desserts are what they're famous for.",

Plum wine made a lovely aperitif.Starters were small so not ideal for sharing, but mains were a good size. Everything tasted fresh with plenty of flavour. Great curry sauce that didn't overpower the prawns.Polite and happy staff - nice styling throughout. Chairs in the window were particularly comfortable which you don't often get in a Japanese restaurant for some reason, they tend to go for simplicity over comfort. Ideal spot if you're in South Kensington as it's just by the station.",

    "text": "The original green tea is good in the aspect of legit flavor. If you go there for food, it is still quite yummy. However, the afternoon tea is not really attractive. I ordered that only for trying out and turned out to be not good at all. You can only have afternoon tea from 3-5pm and they actually decide the food not you. i.e. They may give you tart today or macaroon next time, and you have no choice. From Japanese service, I do no really like this. More, the sushi is not tasty at all. I am sure they did not make rice really traditional,and they should have warmed rice by hands, which obviously they did not do so. I would also use Chinese to comment since many Chinese people go there. \u4e3a\u4e86\u98df\u7269\u800c\u53bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bb6\u5e97\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u62b9\u8336\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u62b9\u8336\u62ff\u94c1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7eaf\u6b63\u7684\u62b9\u8336\u5f88\u6709\u65e5\u672c\u539f\u5473\uff0c\u4f60\u80fd\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u62b9\u8336\u5728\u820c\u5c16\u7684\u505c\u7559\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0b\u5348\u8336\u5e76\u975e\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e00\u4f60\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u5df1\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4eca\u5929\u4ed6\u4eec\u9a6c\u5361\u9f99\u5269\u7684\u591a \u5c31\u7ed9\u4f60\u9a6c\u5361\u9f99\uff0c\u4e8c\u5bff\u53f8\u5e76\u4e0d\u597d\u5403\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7c73\u6ca1\u6709\u7ecf\u8fc7\u624b\u6307\u6309\u538b \u611f\u53d7\u4e0d\u5230\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u624b\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6",

    "text": "Great Japanese Cafe in South Ken, and perfect for escaping the tourist traps of the Le Pain Quotidien and Paul's nearby. Located on Thurloe Street, also home to the nice and cheap Kulu Kulu Sushi, Tombo is a Japanese cafe combined with a deli. Although deli is probably not the word for it - as it serves hot food like bento boxes, dons (rice bowls), and noodles. I fully recommend the matcha latte - which is matcha powder mixed with frothed steamed milk. Absolutely amazing! Their sesame macaroon was perfect - crispy on the outside, fluffy and light middle, and filled with a sticky and not overly sweet sesame paste, which had bags of that burnt sesame flavour. Do try to go for the \u00a34.50 drink + cake offer during tea time (3pm to 5pm) as its superb value for money, especially in South Kensington!

Classic Bento Boxes with choice of main and 3 salads are great as well as \u00a0the best Katsu curry in London.

    "text": "Tombo, Japanese for dragonfly, is a very nice little cafe near South Kensington station. They have a lovely selection of pastries that will make you salivate like Pavlov's dogs at the sight of them, in addition to sushi and some hot food. There is a selection of different Japanese green teas, some Chinese teas, a few English ones and the usual kinds of coffee. More interesting is their other drinks such as hot or cold matcha latte or a matcha frappuccino. If you have tried the matcha frappuccino in other places such as Eat you will find this one much different and much more like what you would expect a Japanese version to be like. The pastries include dorayaki (the little pancakes, filled with green tea paste rather than the usual red bean paste), green tea roll cake filled with different kinds of fruit, green tea ganache cake and many more. Great place to sit down a while and have some very nice pastries and tea. The coffee could be improved upon though.",

    "text": "I adore Tombo a lot! I visited a friend in London and stumbled across this place after we went to the Natural History Museum (it was only a 4-minute walk). It was 6 PM and there was no wait. We were seated immediately and placed our orders. I had the salmon sashimi don and my friend had the teriyaki chicken don. The salmon sashimi don was phenomenal! I occasionally have allergic reactions to raw fish that aren't fresh, but I did not have any this time around. The salmon tasted very fresh and of high quality. The avocado could have been riper but it did not bother me that much. My only gripe about this place is that the green tea desserts were not as great as I thought it would be. The matcha ice cream was too sweet that we could not taste the signature matcha bitter taste. The portions for the dessert was also rather small. It did not match the price they charged us. Overall, fantastic experience, but Tombo probably would not be our go-to place for Japanese food.",

I was expecting a bit more from the entree but the price was reasonable and I would return.

I'm a huge fan of all things Japanese but I wanted to try the salmon and tuna kaisen pok\u00e9, which although it has Japanese influence (it's a raw fish salad), originates in Hawaii I think. It was fun to try something new, but I'm not sure I would get it again as the fish in it was just ok. The black and white rice was interestingly flavoured but next time I would probably go for something more traditionally Japanese.I must confess, I am not the biggest fan of matcha so I wasn't sure how I would manage dessert here. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the marble cheesecake which only had a little matcha on the top and a small layer on the bottom, and it actually went really well with the rich and delicious cheesecake layer. I truly enjoyed my dessert as well as the best-selling Bonsai genmaicha with matcha tea, which was my favourite thing. I also tried the sakura stem tea, but it didn't really taste like cherry blossoms to me and it was just okay. The staff didn't mind us having a leisurely meal on a Saturday afternoon and the atmosphere was really nice just to relax without being rushed. I really enjoyed it!",

The bottom tier holds 4 desserts, and they can also make the whole thing gluten free.My biggest complaint was the service, which was pretty slow in my opinion. Took a while for food to come out and for people to check on us to ask if we needed anything. Additionally, our first server did not know what the gf options were (she incorrectly said that only one of the desserts was gf) and when my friend, who's been to tombo, said that she'd had other gf desserts from tombo our server asked several times if my friend was sure instead of just going to check. She went to check and came back, saying only the brownies were gf to which my friend said she could just replace all the desserts with those then, bc my friend is literally allergic to gluten. Another server inquired in a few mins to confirm whether my friend really wanted 4 gf brownies and said that they had other gf dessert options, so obviously my friend asked for an assortment rather than 4 gf brownies.Food was probably 5 stars and good quality, if not a bit overpriced, but we just had a fairly negative experience with the first server.",

I ate a Matcha Monaka, which looked good but was quite small. The service was okay considering the place was very busy. There are loads of Matcha places popping up all over London now-a-days, but nothing made this one stand out to the others. So I'm just giving it 3/5 stars. Next time I want something Matcha I'll probably choose Tsujiri in Soho. More reviews on my instagram: mattzard",

    "text": "I love Tombo. A friend found it on Instagram and knew that I'd like it. It's a cute, small cafe that serves simple Japanese food that's healthy and quick. It's also a match (green tea) bar as well, with matcha desserts and drinks. London doesn't have a lot of matcha places, so this place is awesome.I've tried the chirashi and salmon sashimi bowls. Both are delicious. They use a mix of multigrain and white sushi rice; so tasty. I've also had the bento box with salmon teriyaki and it's good! My mother tried the chicken teriyaki don buri (rice bowl). She said the chicken was a little dry.Now let's get to the exciting part! Matcha! The matcha sundae is so good! I like the biscuit pieces, but I wish they had Mochi too. Azuki (red) beans are delish. The soft serve matcha is really good too and comes with a cone holder, which is great because if you're lazy, it just sits there and you can lean in your head in for a lick.While the matcha is delicious, I think for desserts, Tsujiri in Soho is better. The soft serve itself is great at both places, but I prefer Tsujiri's sundae (Shirotama).",

I had the Unagi Don (eel) for my main which was delicious and then I got the matcha strawberry cake and shared two of the matcha beverages with my friend (I can't remember their names). I have to say the cake was amazing and I could have loads of it if I could. It's light and fluffy and the tea and strawberry flavours are brought together with the cream. You have to have it! The Sakura macaroons were really nice as well, it's like childhood dreams in food form. I definitely recommend this place and I definitely want to go back for more cakes and drinks. I might be developing a matcha tea dessert obsession but it's too good to resist.",

    "text": "There's always a huge queue to get anywhere for dinner when the Lates are happening around the museums in South Kensington. We walked around a few areas where the wait was ~45 minutes to an hour on a Friday night. With no reservations, Tombo were able to accommodate us after 15 minutes of waiting inside. This place is fairly discrete and you might walk past it a few times without even noticing. However, once you realise that it has just about matcha everything, you can't help but wonder if it knows what to do with all the green tea inside! We ordered a few dishes from a very reasonably priced menu (you'll expect to have a decent sized meal for about ~9-11 GBP, then add drinks and desert, and you'll only be paying less than 20 GBP - in a pretty touristy spot of South Kensington, this one is going to be a hit amongst the students, i'd imagine). The food came quite quickly. The salmon bowl is amazing - it has salmon prepared in three different ways (from tartare to miso cooked) and a bed of rice that is cooked just perfectly. The matcha latte is made just right too - you can't go wrong with this as a drink. Save room for desert because the matcha menu is just as well prepared as the mains and drinks. I would recommend this place if you're after something that's quick, light on the wallet and tastes as if it came straight from the walls of Tokyo.Also, the service is top notch and the interior is designed so you can catch up with friends very easily over a meal or drink, and linger around until late in the evening.",

    "text": "After a long time looking for a place to enjoy a good Japanese dessert in London, I found Tombo.So last Sunday, we \u00a0woke up early to go to the Natural History Museum and took the opportunity to finish the afternoon visiting this matcha bar and cafe.From outside looks very nice, as we walked-in upon a queque, we realized it was full and although was very little, it has different divided environments, even a tiny terrace with a couple of tables.While we're waiting in line for a table (5 minutes), we could delight ourselves watching the variety of desserts on the display and the sushi chef making some dishes as well. The truth is that all looked spectacular, I did not know which to choose, one that most caught my attention was the matcha tiramisu and macaroons, I took note to order them later at the table. It is noteworthy that the atmosphere is very cozy with traditional Japanese simply decorative details and symbols that were combined with London's style. The noise was considerable, although no longer upset you when the desserts arrives to the table.Once we seated, I realized that we arrived late for a desserts tasting, they offered it till 5pm. A pity, but it's an excuse to come back, we should always see the positive side of everything, don't you think?We missed a waiter suggestion, recommendation an a little smile too. They looked like humanoids, but then I though, hold on, we are not in Tokyo. \u00a0So we ordered following our instinct and of course the entrance's display. We went with the intention of eating desserts, not sushi or hot dishes, which impressed me, I thought it was Japanese sweets place, but I was wrong... I'll have to go there again to try their knife's skills.Anyway, we went for the Matcha Sunday, a green tea ice cream with granola, azuki or red bean paste and date syrop with matcha brownie topping, was great, one of the best I've eaten, the touch of matcha powder as topping and its combination with the granola was a totally success, not instead the green tea tiramisu, for me, that dessert is not even close to a real tiramisu at all, it can not be called like that, this GT buttery cream is an offense to traditional Italian dessert, but \u00a0I must say that my daughter liked the Oreo's base. We also enjoyed the Matcha Strawberry short cake, very well done and it has a real good balance, very fresh, lovely spongy and with nice proportion of each element, finally we loved the Matcha frappe iced milk shake, it's good quality matcha presence is questionless.As I said before, the service was very poor, the staff limited only to take the order. Although I have to say that when we were about to leave, the kitchen team thanked us in a very Japanese and pleasantly way.",

I don't know what strange force hit me, but it was one of those ungovernable cravings whose demands you have no other choice but to follow.Tombo offers a traditional matcha tea for \u00a34.95, completed with mochi. I'm not a fan of adzuki-filled mochi, so opted for the matcha latte. They didn't have soya but do have almond milk. It was quite watery, but the taste was overall good. My partner got the matcha latte with regular milk and the matcha cheesecake. He said that both were okay, but still doesn't quite get the matcha latte trend.This is a bit of a novelty spot, prices are a little high which is to be expected in South Kensington, but I will undoubtedly be back to try the veggie bento box with the nasu dengaku (miso aubergine). Good option if you need to refuel near the museums.",

The place is not big with a small open kitchen bar.I ordered the Don rice bowl - miso katsu pork, temari sushi set to start.The sushi was great, the quality was perfect! Miso katsu was a horrible mistake. The pork chop was very dry! \u00a0The miso sweet sauce was not sweet in a good way a bit acidic. In addition they garnish it with raw white cabbage, cut thick and very bitter. Huge turn off.For dessert I had the matcha latte which was great!!!! I also did order the matcha sundae which was good but somehow not too creamy and sweet as I would like it to be.Overall good place for drinks (they serve alkohol and matcha beer!!!!), matcha teas, latte, desserts and cakes. Sushi worth the try too!! Still avoid any sort of meat here its dry, dry, dry..... I think they prep it outside and then microwave it at the cafe. Price wise for the area its just ok.",

It's a small cafe that gets busy with a lot of health conscious ladies out there who just cannot resist sweets. If that sounds like you it's a match made in heaven with light bento box option that even has no carb option. I went for the grilled salmon that comes with three side dishes that really fills you up as its full of healthy veg and soya beans. But the real gem is the list of matcha desserts! The matcha sundae is definitely to be shared and it comes with warm brownies with azuki (red bean) paste. The ice cream is soft and there's no icy flaky bits like you get in some frozen green tea ice cream you get in Asian shops here. Definitely going back for more desserts.",

Sorry snog)Looks like the matcha dessert trend is hitting London. You can find all sort of matcha cakes and drinks in their menu. Infect all of them is matcha flavour. Matcha cake, matcha pancake, matcha brownie, sundae in only matcha flavour, etc. I ordered a matcha sundae and one Sakura ice tea. The Sakura ice tea is rather blend. Prefer it to be stronger. Matcha Sundae was nice. It has good balance of matcha taste and milky creamy taste. People who love stronger matcha green taste will prefer their matcha sundae more compare to Tsujiri.They do serve sushi, noodle and other Japanese meal. I think I will be back to try out their Japanese meal next time when I'm around there.Aug 2016I came back to this place again for dinner this time. We order one udon, unagi don (grill eel rice) and sashimi don. The portion is not too big. Taste not bad. Salmons are fresh. They only do salmon for their sushi and sashimi dishes.",

It wasn't too busy, and unfortunately the service was quite poor and the food was mediocre.I ordered the salmon chirashi bowl, came out really quick and it was OK. My friend ordered the eel don and unfortunately her eel was still cold. They remade it which is fine, but it was clear its not something freshly made, but rather just heated up really quickly to serve over rice.As for the dessert, which was what we were most excited for. We placed our orders and considering how quickly our food came, it was odd how long our dessert was taking. So we inquired, and my friend's dessert finally came and they noted mines will take a little bit longer. Fine, a few more moments past and still nothing. Then they came by for last call, and we reminded them again. Another few moments has past and my friend flagged them with a very annoyed - what's taking so long for matcha ice cream and then they finally put it together and brought it to the table. No apologies. To be honest, when service is poor, I usually give the place another try before leaving a mediocre review. However all things considered, the food and dessert was just meh - I've had better Salmon chirashi bowl and matcha ice cream around London, so I really don't want to come back.",

    "text": "They have a short menu, but quick service with fresh fish. Don't be put off by the apparent lack of space when you first look in, they have more seating at the back.The staff was super nice and very helpful. I heard them patiently & elaborately explain their matcha menu to a couple on the next table who were visiting from Australia. The couple also must have been impressed. They bought lots of tea to carry home with them.For myself, I ordered a salmon maki sushi and and a pork Katy's bento. But my server came back to tell me that the katsu was fried in the same oil as the shrimp (which I had mentioned I was allergic to), so I switched to a healthier miso salmon.The fish was perfectly cooked and I loved all 3 vegetable sides that they served with it. The rice was a whole bowl. The next time I'm here, I'll probably order one plate of sushi and a bento box without the rice. I'm not a big fan of matcha (I don't like its powdery mouth feel), and I told my server that. She recommended that I try their latte and she was right, I loved it! It didn't leave that powdery grainy texture on my tongue. The foam on top had a bit of it, but my latte was perfect! Will definitely go back when I'm in the area. The food was super fresh, healthy and tasty. Service was lovely and fast - a great place to grab a bite before or after a museum visit",

    "text": "Having viewed the menu before arriving, I was really anticipating my meal. However the food taste lacked what I was expecting even though the presentation was done well.Starting with a tempura prawn roll that surprisingly was made with red beans rice, therefore the sweet flavour didn't compliment the prawn. I could not find enough wasabi and soy sauce to temper the flavour.Then came the mains of the kaisen poke bowl and tantanmen ramen. The ramen broth was plain and clear, save for the spice of the minced meat. With just a few pickles mixed in, I was hoping for more in terms of toppings. The poke bowl had a nice ratio of salmon, tuna, edamame and avocado with crunchy onions. Again served on sweet rice it faired better than the prawn roll. However it lacked a real soy sauce or something to give it a flavour boost.The matcha frappe was a refreshing drink. It was not entirely original or presented well, so one could have easily mistaken it for the Starbucks version. However it still went down easy!This is a decent place for lunch and I do want to try their matcha latte. They obviously have a large matcha dessert menu and sell the powder so that may be where their specialty lies. I think my cooking fairs better in terms of oishi Japanese cuisine so don't come here expecting more than what you might find at a chain.",

We were fortunate to just beat the lunch crowd. I ordered the miso salmon bento and she ordered the pork katsu bento. The side dishes with the bento were nicely flavored. The main protein was bit dry though. The salmon doesn't really taste like it had been marinated in miso. Perhaps it was just used as a glaze? The katsu was nicely fried with the panko being crispy but the pork was also a little tough and on the dry side. I also ordered a match latte and it was really nice. I thought the matcha flavor was nicely balanced, much better than what you would get from a coffee chain in the States. Overall, a reasonably priced eatery with decent food.",

I think it's just slightly not worthy for a 4-star review as even though my partner absolutely adored his dish, I thought mine was just OK - decently tasty but nothing out of this world.~ Atmosphere:It's a cute little place, tightly cramped and you might have trouble getting a seat but it's clean and has a very stylish atmosphere.~ Customer Service:I see other people here complaining about the service but I honestly didn't experience anything negative. The food came out at a decent time even though the place was packed and everything was done and dusted quickly.~ Food:We ordered the Temari Sushi Set to start for \u00a39.95 and it didn't entirely feel worth it and the use of non-traditional sushi rice (they use multigrain) did not really work in my honest opinion. That might just be down to personal preference though but I'm a huge fan of sushi and approached it with an open mind. I think the rice just had too much flavour in itself and overwhelmed all of the selection where aside from the unagi, I couldn't taste the seafood at all. The taste of prawn especially disappeared off the face of the Earth compared to the flavoured rice.For my main I got Tan Tan Noodles for \u00a39.85 - this was yummy and had good flavour, but nothing out of this world.---Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back. However, I feel like London has a lot more to offer in terms of delicious Japanese cuisine. Tombo is OK - but that's about it.",

For the price, I expected higher quality fish. The sides it came with were also nothing memorable. 2 - Curry with Pork Katsu - My fiance got this as his entree - the katsu was breaded well and added a thin layer of crunch. The pork itself was a little touch, but the curry sauce was very flavorful. 3- Matcha Frappe - Almost like a milk shake, I liked that it was not too sweet4- Matcha Lemonade - Very refreshing drink that had the perfect balance of matcha and lemonade5 - Some sort of dessert that consisted of matcha ice cream on a wafer with mochi and red bean paste - serving size was way smaller than I imagined / it looked in the picture so that was disappointing. If i ever make it back here, I would probably just get the matcha ice cream cone.",

    "text": "Eh. This is the first review in which I decrease score because of something other than food. I think the place might be a strong 3 or weak 4 stars in normal circumstances.We went there on big recommendation from some Japanese food experts. We arrived early and managed to dodge the queue. Just barely though. 5 Mon after we say there were 8 people waiting. It was Saturday about 5.30-5.40 in October. The place was packed though the atmosphere was unpretentious, our neighbour ate sushi with his hands. Though the worst thing about the place was temperature. They had doors open the whole time on a cold October evening. I heard several other people complain about that among themselves. I don't think anyone complained but isn't it common sense to keep it warm?It is well priced for South Kensington. We ordered our meals, sashimi combo and spicy ramen. Plus for photos of food on the menu. We both enjoyed our meals. Good, not great. Spicy ramen wasn't all that spicy and sashimi I've had better one but it was still ok. I was quite disappointed when I had to ask for a spoon for my ramen. I also had to ask a few times for a refill of my drink. I'm bad at chopsticks so it took me forever to finish my ramen but we had a plan to get the Japanese green tea ice cream. My companion asked for a desert menu fairly quickly though we waited for it like 20-30 minutes. We didn't mind much as I am super slow at eating ramen. We knew immediately what ice cream we wanted and we ordered it. We had to order it several times as different waiters kept forgetting about it. And we waited good 30-40 min for it. If the ice cream wasn't this highly recommended, we'd have left beforehand.After long wait we got our ice creams with apologies and they were good. Apparently tasted straight like the original ice cream in Japan. I thought it was interesting though not sure how big of a fan I am of it. By the time I finished my ice cream, it was 7.40 pm. Considering that main meals came really quickly we thought that was quite a waste of time. We quickly paid and left. Only after paying I noticed 12.5% service charge! I can excuse bad service, I was in the past such waiter and I know it is sometimes hard. But a compulsory hidden service charge after such experience... After we left we talked on the restaurant. We didn't talk much about food. We talked service.Normally it would have been weak 4 stars. But I take away one star for service and one star for open doors. Go for ice cream, skip main course.",
