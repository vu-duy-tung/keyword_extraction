The place is decked out like an American diner, filled with high booths and huge screens showing American sports. The staff are uber friendly and go out there way to accommodate your needs. I think it's the most fun to go here with a few people and order loads of stuff to share ribs, pulled pork, BBQ chicken and sides to include mash, beans, corn on the cob, nachos, quesadilla and much more \u00a0as I said, a real feast! The drinks here are also really nice, they serve American old-school style ginger beer, cream soda and dandelion and burdock. Watch out for the offers as well \u00a0if you visit early evening you pay the price of the time you order eg 5:35pm and you'll pay \u00a35.35. It's good food and a giggle too!",

The burnt ends which are usually tender, were just tough and fatty. The waitress could tell that we were having a bad time and didn't even bother to ask us if there was anything she could do to help, she just dumped the bill and left. They have also recently gotten rid of their sprits and cocktails from all of their restaurants, bar Soho, in order to bring \"parity\" to their restaurants, according to the manager. We were not the only ones to complain and judging by the poor attendance on a Sunday, we were not the only ones to be put off by the new higher prices and worse off menu. Typically they have chosen the lowest common denominator to bring parity with. Such a shame - this place used to be great. We won't be going again.",

It doesn't have the truly authentic American feeling that it used to, which is a shame. Still for a quick, cheap, meat-filled eat, it is worth a look.",

The third? Just arriving back in town ater a blissful holiday and gastro-tour of New York City, I was already missing American-style food, and meat barbecure for that matter. Bodeans it was!Friendly staff who were forthcoming with suggestions (a feature of all Bodeans staff I have come across); and fun booths to sit in; we had delicious buffalo wings and chunky o-so-naughty blue cheese dressing. Triple the price and not quite as good as BWs in NYC, but still amazingly glazed, sauced and moreish. I had a Pulled Pork sandwich upon recommendation, and it was pretty good, but a little dry. Needed some extra mayo and bbq sauce. Ribs are yummy too. \u00a310 Sundays rock - Full rack of ribs, sides and beer. Get some help finishing this! *Highlight: meeting Mr Bodean himself. He was speaking to everyoe at the tables the night I was there last. He was especially keen to know what I thought of his BBQ Mayo special recipe. AMAZING! A full belly, a vow to go back to the gym and a great old messy time is had with each visit.",

The pork itself was pretty tasty, although the bread bun it was served on was a little bit cheap and nasty. The coleslaw was good as were the chips. We ordered bottles of Coors, and they were literally ice cold (all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right) and so refreshing. Bodeans would be amazing with a hangover and is pretty decent anyway, and quite reasonably priced.

Our waitress messed up our order and kept us waiting for a while for our main but they were busy and the food is worth the wait so I wouldnt let it put you off (although a free starter as an apology would have been nice) Go here! You won't regret it!",

It's layout is like a typical diner with comfy seating and, though not the largest venue, it can seat quite a few people and does get very busy. Service is always very attentive. Maybe too attentive as last time my friend were constantly interrupted by someone asking us if we were okay, which annoyed us even more as the only condiment we requested failed to arrive though the checks persisted. Food-wise, it's nothing amazing. I've had better burgers and ribs elsewhere. We got there just after 6 and were eligible for a stop the clock promotion where on certain dishes you pay whatever the time you order is, ie; 6.30pm = \u00c2\u00a36.30, which was quite novel. The food also arrived quite quickly so I can recommend this place for those booked into the nearby cinema.",

    "text": "Following some good reviews I decided to give Bodeans BBQ a try. The restaurant was easy to find: only a few hundred yards from Clapham Common tube station, just head up Clapham High Street away from the common and it is on the right. Starters are \u00a34-7 and include clam chowder, smoked chicken gumbo, ribs and quesadillas. I went for the Nachos Supreme which came with salsa, sour cream and guacamole. Mains range from \u00a36-17 and are very much American Grill style: hot meat sandwiches, salads, burgers, chicken, ribs, pulled pork and steaks. I went for a combo of chicken, pulled pork and smoked sausages served with a baked potato and creamed corn. The food was well prepared and tasty. I will definitely be back. The food was good and the service was friendly and fast. Tuesday's half-price steaks night sounds like a bargain, but I am also intrigued by their 'Burnt Ends' described as slow smoked pieces of beef brisket in a light BBQ sauce which are only available on Wednesdays. All I have to do now is decide if I go back on Tuesday or Wednesday Addendum: I managed to get back there on Tuesday to try the steaks, which are half price on Tuesdays. The restaurant was busy, as you would expect, but they still managed to seat me quite quickly. After that the service fell through a hole in the floor: which was rather disappointing. I had the Clam Chowder, which was nice, and then a rare steak. Unfortunately the steak suffered from two flaws: it was seasoned with something which rather dominated the flavour (I'd prefer my steak to taste of steak!); and the other problem was my rare steak was served on a hot cast-iron plate which meant that my Rare steak started life as a Medium, and by the time I finished the steak was close to well done. Despite the snags I still enjoyed my meal, the general atmosphere was good and the food, despite the flaws, was still OK. If you are a steak purist I suggest you try somewhere else. I prefer rare fillet steaks, and these are simply not on offer here.",

I loveBodeans because it is not upper class pretentious dining - nor is it scraping the barrel. It is damn good hearty food on a rather large plate! In a very pleasant setting :)Obvisouly being a BBQ and rather american stylee there are lots of juicy steaks, chunky chips and naughty sides like garlic bread and onion rings. Everything i have ever eaten here i have enjoyed. My fav however are the HUGE ribs in sticky BBQ sauce. very yummy. The staff are efficient and make for a quick and easy night where you will not get hungry waiting. They do some random offers which i see have already been mentioned above, so look out for those! If you are looking for somewhere not too quite but not too loud, fun and friendly doing great food (in BIG portions) for small prices then this is your place. Enjoy!",

Now I'm not talking about Heinz \"BBQ\" Sauce or heavens forbid \"brown sauce\" but rather the rich tomato-ey slightly acidic full of meaty flavour sauce that explodes in your mouth and is almost better than the actual meat.We went to Bodean's for a house valentines day dinner...and basically because we were craving steak and pulled pork. Bodean's is true to its nature and provides some quality smoked meats with hefty helpings of BBQ sauce.I got the \"Pig Out\" deal (Pulled pork and ribs combo with 'slaw, fries, and a beer for \u00a310) although I wouldn't say I pigged out on what they provided. The pulled pork was about half a handful and the ribs a half rack at best. Still, the meat was tender and juicy and the fries crispy and excellently spiced. The beer was actually a half-pint and I would have felt quite silly if not for the fact one of my housemates donated her half-pint so they brought me a full one (a big boy beer if you will). \u00a0After demolishing the leftovers from two others, I felt that I had reached the \"Pig Out\" point and did what any other foodie would do. I had dessert.Dessert consisted of a slice of pecan pie with ice cream. Delicious. I liked this Bodean's for the comfortable atmosphere, the friendly staff, the tasty food, and the unlimited supply of sauce. I would prefer larger portions (I cut my teeth on the Texas style BBQ restaurants in which they sell the meats by weight not dish) but it's probably better for the waistline that they aren't.",

Oh you know we are in Europe :P \u00a0You don't go to a BBQ place unless you like meat people (and lots of it!).I'm not going to tell you that Bodeans is the best BBQ place ever BUT, if you live in London, are from the US and like BBQ then this is a little slice of red, white and blue. \u00a0They even serve american beer that I am a big fan of including Sam Adams and Bluemoon so that alone gives them the 4th star. ANNND they have a sport schedule of American games (mostly NFL and college football right now), so you can actually go watch the 1pm EST NFL game there on a Sunday night for dinner! (Darn I miss real NYC sports bars where you can't even see the walls because it's all covered with tvs with every single game on).Okay ya, back to food... pulled pork sandwich was good, but I think it would be better if they asked you what sauce you wanted and came out with it prepared that way (they give you a sandwich with pulled pork and then you add the sauce from a choice of 2 at the table). Then if there was too little sauce you could add some more. \u00a0Also had the buffalo wings there, and although not the same by most US standards, they were pretty darn close and the amount of chicken you actually received with your buffalo wings was surprising! Definitely order them at least hot though, hot was at most medium in US terms and I can't imagine them tasting at all like buffalo wings in a mild sauce.I don't have anything negative to say about the waitstaff, they were fine enough and although when it is packed it does seem they could use some help, they get to you in good enough time... i'm learning to let go of my US \"chew and screw\" mentality and start to take a real lunch break so it's nice to not feel rushed out of a place as soon as you take your last bite of food!",

Perhaps best of all, they serve Canadian beer which we really enjoy as my other half is Canadian and we haven't seen it in any other restaurant outside of North America. Like the other reviewers said, there isn't a lot of choice for vegetarians but let me ask you this: if you don't eat meat then why the hell would you go to a place whose main speciality is BBQ meat?! I have pretty harsh feelings on vegetarians dining out anyway, (and vegetarians in general, actually...sorry!) but surely if you know you're not going to be able to eat a single thing on the menu at Bodeans then why go there? I, on the other hand LOVE meat and I think Bodeans does the best BBQ meat around. That's all the positive points about this place and the reason it's got 2 stars. Bodeans in Clapham is missing 3 stars because of it's total lack of service. There seems to be an incredibly high turnover of staff as every time we went there we saw a whole new set of faces serving us. There is a severe lack of staff and at it's busiest times, you're extremely lucky if you get the attention of a server when you need one within half an hour. It got to the point that we used to look up the menu on the web and decide what we were going to order before we even got there so that we could get our order in the second we were seated by a server as we had no idea how long it would be before we saw them again. We also got into the habit of ordering 2 drinks each all at once because we knew we'd be totally out of luck if we needed a refill on our beer halfway through the meal. There was also a time where we were sitting in a booth when it started to get busy and the waitress seated a couple of total strangers next to us at our table - it felt like a really awkward double date. If there's no free tables, I think people should be made to wait for one like at every other restaurant in the world. \u00a0I also don't like that this restaurant only seems to own one CD - the very best of Creedance Clearwater Revival. Great band, but if you come here for a meal, you're going to be sitting there for a looooooooong time and you really don't want to hear the same tracks loop at least 3 times before you leave. If it weren't for the absolutely incredible food, we'd have stopped coming here after our first disastrous visit.",

Plus, they carry ridiculously overpriced American beers, like Sierra Nevada. At nearly \u00a35 a pint, this is a total rip-off, but I still drink them.Not a place to go way out of your way for, but solid. Just remember which type of ribs you're ordering.",

    "text": "The fact that my first visit to a Bodean was in the fifth year of my stay in London speaks volumes about my inertia and oversight. But that's past now and I have made my inaugral visit there this month. My friend and I had already had four drinks (or more) each by the time we reached here for dinner. So I apologise in advance for missing any important piece of information. My friend had probably never had ribs earlier and went for a full rack of baby back ribs (why are they called so btw ?). The ribs were simply outstanding. Soft and succulent, the meat was easy to tear from the bone. I provided him with considerable help in order to finish the plate ;)I went for the meatloaf, one of my favourite American dishes. It was well made, and was accompanied by mashed potatoes (which is common) and some sweet corn. This was new for me. I usually avoid sweet dishes with main courses, but I did eat a considerable part of this preparation. Bodean has a small but sufficient wine list. I had a glass of rose wine which was decent. Our dinner set us back by only \u00a316 per person ... so it's quite affordable. I have tried only two of the several dishes that this barbecue chain is known for, but I already have a good feeling about the rest of the items on the menu. Can't wait to try them :)",

They have great BBQ sauce and a selection of hotter sauces on each table. The fries are great with a very tasty seasoning on it. My partner loves the ribs! Gets them every time! It's has a great atmosphere and I love seeing baseball, ice hockey and even grid iron on the TV - just adds to the feel of the place. The price is pretty decent and they have a club card you can get where you'll get 2-4-1 on Mondays and free stuff throughout the week. We've been to all 4 in London and the service we've received at each has been top notch. I've recommended this place to family and friends and they've enjoyed it too.",

If you LOVE BBQ as much as I do, you need to give this place a try.First the one thing I didn't like. The TVs, I despise going out to eat and having TVs blaring. This restaurant had 3 but at least they were not obnoxiously loud.We got that out of the way, onwards we go.The atmosphere is casual, the decor is mostly wood. \u00a0It's nothing fancy yet it's comfortable and clean.Eunique was our server a lovely young girl that was ever so accommodating. She was sweet and very helpful. I'm not a pork rib fan so I opted for the beef ribs. A little more pricey but well worth it. You get two bones, fries and coleslaw. It was enough for two meals really. \u00a0They were done perfectly, fall off the bone and had a lovely flavour. My eyes could not stop rolling around in my head from delight.I really want to go back. Writing this review is making my mouth water all over again.",

    "text": "So I came here for my birthday and it was happy hour! Amazing! It was quiet as I had to book for 5pm as online, there were no later bookings available which was a bit disappointing, but it meant our night got started earlier (a good thing or not, I'm not sure!) It did start to pick up though, and the food came rather quickly, as did the drinks. They limit the happy hour cocktails to around 8-10 (if I can remember correctly). I had the Alabama Slammer which was delish, and Tokyo ice tea, also very yummy! I also had the passion daisy which I think was my favourite. I wants the negroni as Bombay Sapphire him in my fave, but unfortunately they didn't have all the ingredients necessary. The food came in bigger portions than I imagined! For starters we shared nachos and chicken wings... Deffo more than enough and very tasty! For mains I had a 1/2 chicken and rib combo which came with chips and coleslaw. I asked for chilli chips, however I was not aware that this meant beef chilli (it didn't state on the menu) and I don't eat beef, therefore I had to send it back. I didn't expect them to change the whole meal but at least the plate, as when the plate came back it had the stains of the beef chilli on it! 2 of my friends also ordered it but it didn't arrive on their plates, however when we got the bill, we got charged for it! Deffo wasn't willing to pay, so we sent the bill back. Other than that little mishap, I enjoyed my experience at Bodeans and would return again, but maybe eat a little less!",

    "text": "So this is the second time I've been to Bodeans, the first being the Balham one down the road. I thought that it was...okay. I'm not a massive fan of American style restaurants which serves just meat, and in my opinion, their drinks offer was their saving grace. As we were there from 5pm, we were in time for their Happy Hour which runs from 3pm to 6pm, Monday to Friday and all day Sundays. For my first round I opted for a Bellini and a Passion Daisy. Both were delicious and hit the spot straight away! For my second round (which I had later on), I opted for a Bramble and a Scarlett O'Hara, which again were both delicious and sweet. As we were a group of 6 we ordered 2 portions of nachos to share and one portion of the hot buffalo wings to share. I think that that is my favourite thing on the menu - the buffalo wings. They were great! Meaty and saucy, very tasty. For mains, I think my eyes were bigger than my belly as I ordered the 1/2 Chicken, Pulled Pork and Grilled Smoked Sausage which came with chips and Coleslaw. Also for \u00a316.45, I didn't think that that was a bad price for all of that food. When we ordered, we asked for chilli cheese fries thinking that it would be fries with chilli sauce and cheese on top however when it came it was with chilli con carne. Now myself and one of my dinner companions don't eat beef due to religious reasons so when we explained our misunderstanding to the waitress, she was very accommodating and replaced the chilli cheese fries for normal ones. Two of our other dinner companions HAD ordered the chilli cheese fries however when theirs came, neither of them had the chilli on it. Maybe it was because we had sent ours back - I don't know why but we told them to tell the waiting staff but they couldn't be bothered. The good itself was okay. The chicken, although seasoned well was dry as was the pulled pork. I liked the smoked sausage, that was tasty and the chips and coleslaw were okay, pretty average. Between 4 of us we also ordered the Mac & Cheese to have on the side and that was pretty good. But I think that I was just full up from drinks and generally not having eaten a lot during the day. When the bill came, the waiter had kept the chilli cheese fries on the bill - even though two of us hadn't actually received them however after we told them they took it off. We also were able to take our leftovers away which was good. Overall, Bodeans is okay. Good for people who like their meat and American food. For me, I don't think I will be visiting again in a hurry.",

We ordered chicken wings (bbq and buffalo) and half of a chicken with a side of coleslaw and roasted veggies (cherry tomatoes and sliced up okra). Wings were quite big and generously dressed, chicken was nicely roasted (not brined enough though), veggies were awesome and slaw was meh. Almost comparable with US standards on BBQ (they have sam adams & blue moon to clean up your greasy taste buds) so we will obviously be back.",

The milkshakes are nice too. But I felt I got ripped off when I ordered a milkshake to go one time.... 4.50 plus service charge...and it was so small and lame I felt a bit miffed!",

    "text": "God Bless America I found some BBQ that reminds me of the land of the free and home of the Blue Moon Beer. (yeah, it's a good beer) The barbecue is tasty, tender and choice of sauces quite good. I felt transported back the the states while in Bodean's aside from being surrounded by folks with British accents. LOL, I'm sure that was their intent. :) I believe this was one of the best BBQ experiences to date I've had in London.Bodean's BBQ is pretty damn good y'all and the only thing I was missing was a big ol' glass of sweetened ice tea, but as they say you can't have it all.",
