    "text": "What we ate on a Saturday evening around 6.30pm..6 Rock Oysters - \u00a312.00 (accompanied by brown bread with seaweed butter, shallot vinaigrette, sauce 'am\u00e9ricaine', lemon )The plump juicy oysters were served on ice in a raised platter and shucked well enough to be nearly overflowing with briny juice. The homemade seaweed butter was a thoughtful addition but did not come close to the same from god of butter, Jean-Yves Bordier. Their sauce am\u00e9ricaine had much more bite and spice than any Heinz replica, a meaty substitute for Tabasco.Frenchie Burger - \u00a313.75 (includes chips)This is a burger with confit pork belly, rocket tomato-onion compote and Morbier cheese served on a peppered brioche bun. The bun was delicious and a soft peppery pillow for some serious ingredients. The burger was huge and heavy with meaty flavour thanks to the additional porky belly, the nutty Morbier and jammy compote lifting the meat with some huge hits of flavour. There was some additional french mustard in here somewhere which was not listed in the menu. The chips were good, just good, skinny and lots of them but scoring a 6/10.Piggie Burger - \u00a313.75 (includes chips)This burger is served in a Cheddar bun with bbq pulled pork, Bibb lettuce, green chili mayonnaise and red cabbage slaw. The cheese on the bun was strong and gave a great pungent bite to the beautifully soft pork and then the firm burger. The lettuce, mayo and slaw added softness, heat and crunch so there was lots going on in every mouthful. The pulled pork was so good we would have easily eaten a whole plate of this smothered over the 6/10 chips.Souffl\u00e9 au citron - \u00a39.50A super light lemon souffl\u00e9 was served with a jug of spiced sugar poire william and vanilla coulis. A bit pricey but was nice enough.\u00cele exotique - \u00a38.00This dessert was amazing, the lime floating island was filled with a mango cr\u00e9meux and sat on a coconut anglaise. Dotted around the plate were tiny bites of spiced pineapple, pomegranite and basil leaves and little bit of everything on the spoon was divine, it was a random choice but worth it.Drink1 glass of Nittnaus Pinot Noir 'Kurzberg', Burgenland, Austria (2007) - \u00a38.501 Sierra Nevada pale ale - \u00a34.752 Peppermint teas - \u00a39.00 (they used fresh peppermint but still expensive for water and leaves)AtmosphereWe ate at 6.30pm on a Saturday and there was a great atmosphere with a busy mix of tables, banquets and booths of dates, family meals, groups of friends and single diners. The open kitchen is exciting and honest and adds to the buzz of the diners and staff. Very attentive service keeps you looked after and there is reasonable 2hr 15mins turnaround in place. Plus, as in all good hotels, toilets are clean and attended.OffersThree course set menu meal for \u00a320 served seven days between 12pm-2.30pm and 5.30pm- 7pmVerdictGO! GO! GO!We will definitely go back to Bar Boulud. The burgers were ordered medium-rare but were served medium so in future we'll ask for rare. The set menu looked excellent value and the location is perfect for popping in when shopping around Knightsbridge. Always book, we saw lots of people being turned away.",

    "text": "I was first introduced to this place by my parents friends who have lived in London for about 4 years longer than I have. We came here as a party of 6 on quite a busy Friday evening, but made sure we made it in time for the Prix Fixe menu (before 7pm). The atmosphere was very nice, posh, contemporary with a dash of NY flavor (just like the one in NYC). It was good to be able to share a nice meal with my parents, who only visit London once a year, and who do love a good meal every now and then. We did order from the Prix Fixe menu along with the token burger just to try it out and assess what the fuss about Daniel Boloud's burgers are all about. I still remember starting with the French Onion soup au gratin and the Coq au Vin for the main. The food and service were absolutely delightful and I would have given it 5 stars back when we were Boloud virgins. Since then I've come back here 4-5 times and service and food quality have suffered a little.The last time I came here was a couple of weeks ago when my roommate and I were celebrating this new gig that I got (see my profile for related reviews from getting a new job :P). The Prix Fixe menu was of choice again, since I'd come other times and have already had the wonder of the a la carte stuff. Anyway, I started with an AMAZING terrine a la morocco, which was just delightful, but a less exciting main. It seems like the main choices have become a little dated and tired, less exciting than when I first popped by Boloud cherry back in Nov 2010. I had a grilled chicken breast with creamed polenta, all were very tasty, and the grilled chicken was done almost to perfection... I've never thought I could have had chicken breast that moist. Anyway, I devoured that sucker, but got to the last piece, and with grilled chicken, if you want to get it this moist, it almost has to be just at the right temps. I must have gotten the fleshiest part of the meat on my 3rd slice and it was just a little too underdone for me. So... being the perfectionist that I am, I sent it back (oh for shame!!)... They returned the dish as if I hadn't touched it and it was done just as well as the first time. Lets just say, I still LOVE coming to this place, the service is amazing, and the food is REALLY good. I'd say that the glassed-wine selection needs to be a little improved and that the Prix Fixe menu needs a little defibrillator action, but overall, still a place I would love to come back to and bring people on dates. 4 stars, only because Yelp doesn't do 4.5 stars!!",

    "text": "For full review and pictures seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Finally I have made it to Bar Boulud, next to Knightsbridge tube station located in the ground floor of the exceedingly posh Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Bar Boulud has been written up to death (e.g. MarinaMetro, AA Gil, Jay Rayner, and a myriad of bloggers) so I will keep myself short. The owner and chef, Daniel Boulud, is a successful restaurateur in New York where he doesn't only have a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars ('Daniel') but is also famous for his up-market burgers . For me \u00a0coming from Austria \u00a0burgers did not exist until I moved to England apart from in the form of McDonalds hamburgers. It took me quite a while to get my head around the fact that a burger should be taken seriously and can be truly delicious. So the burger slowly made its way from being my favourite hangover food to actually being eaten for real enjoyment even without prior alcohol exposure. Anyway, what I want to say is that my burger experience is limited and I am far from being a burger expert \u00a0so I approached Bar Boulud and its famous burgers (which I of course had to try) with a relatively unbiased attitude but with high expectations. For Knightsbridge and for being in the Mandarin Oriental I thought the atmosphere at Bar Boulud was rather pleasant and it was frequented by a mixed crowd. It was Wednesday evening and very busy \u00a0we only got a table in the bar area (with stylish but hugely uncomfortable chairs). In fact it was so busy that we were more or less ignored by the waiters for the first part of the evening. Later on service picked up however and the waiters were friendly and seemed to be doing their best. I started with the beetroot salad with goat's cheese and walnut (8). I was not terribly impressed actually. Everything, even though tasty, was slightly underseasoned and especially the salad leaves could have done with some kind of dressing. Then of course the DBGB Yankee burger (12 + 1 for cheese). Maybe I expected something like an orgasmic burger experience (which might be too much to ask from pour Daniel Boulud) but somehow the burger failed to induce any culinary arousal. Don't get me wrong, it was quite nice. The meat was extremely high quality and perfectly medium rare as requested. It was however bordering on cold when served and in the end it was just a not very exciting burger and I was a bit disappointed.",

    "text": "Where: Bar Boulud, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, KnightsbridgeWith whom: The MasticatorHow much?: \u00a3110 for the two of us. That was four courses (Prix Fixe plus an extra charcuterie course) This was the week that we got news of another American import, Keith McNally, bringing a feted and famous New York brasserie to London (Balthazar, in partnership with Richard Caring's Caprice Holdings). Both McNally and Daniel Boulud, at whose new London outpost we were dining, are considered by many to be American chefs, and both made their large reputations there however both were born in Europe, Keith McNally a few miles up the road from his planned new home. I came to praise Daniel Boulud, but instead walk away strangely unsatisfied. As a dining experience overall, it wasn't one that will live long in the memory. It wasn't the staff. They were as well drilled, knowledgable and friendly a brigade as I've seen... It wasn't the decor. The light, well proportioned space is a graceful place for the well heeled to dine... Admittedly I was less sure about the arty splashes on the wall. The blot art of famous red wine vintages intrigued but were only vaguely reminicent of blood stained rorchach drawings. Sadly, and more fundamentally, it was the food. We went for a so-so Corbier, fair enough, but a little too earthy for both of us. It came from a large and excellent winelist priced squarely for the Four Seasons clientele. There are only a handful below \u00a350, the rest quickly hit hedge fund levels. The relatively long and involved menu presented a thrill as it was knowledgeably announced by our gallic host. There were certainly sparks of excellence here. Themes of charcuterie, sausage, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and burger were highlighted and so we decided to go for the Prix Fixe with an additional charcuterie course (supplied by expert Parisian charcuterie supplier Gilles Verot). The small plate was more than ample and made a very good pre-starter paired with a moreish (light in texture but richly flavoured) boudin blanc sausage and its accompanying garlic mash. A very good salami made up for the dry and too subtle ham. P\u00e2t\u00e9s (particularly the tagine dagneau, a heavily spiced Maroc influenced lamb and aubergine mix and a superb p\u00e2t\u00e9 grand-m\u00e8re) really excelled and the portions of the small plate were the ideal way to sample. The chilled pea soup was simple elegance and one dish I'll remember for a long time. Fresh, creamy and with an occasional snap of tiny rosemary flavoured cruton, it hit the spot perfectly. Sadly it went a little down hill from here. The Masticator's burger was initially dry, tasteless, unseasoned and lukewarm with a shredded lettuce, 'special sauce' and thin, limp tomato combination eeriely remenicent of a certain golden arched chain. Only a tasty brioche bun saved it. The team were swift to offer a replacement due to the temperature but this arrived in the same state (albeit warmer). The chips were inedibly saline. My roasted chicken breast had a rich rustic and flavoursome taste of pure perfect poultry and arrived, in comparison, piping hot. Slightly dry too though sadly, it was helped by a rich (if salty) gravy but badly let down by rather floury fingerling potatoes and overcooked artichokes. The Masticator had further problems with his desert (though this time arguably of his own making). A pervading scent of lavender that put him off his two (small) scoops of mint and coconut ices was tracked down to the overpowering handwash in the Mandarin Oriental bathroom. That aside, a powder dry hazelnut cookie didn't add to the experience. My exotic fruit sundae was preceded by a long spoon hightening childish anticipation before it arrived in a Martini glass. A pleasant but not earth-shattering m\u00e9lange of passion fruit pur\u00e9e and cream came with nuggets of an excellent coconut macroon to give some needed bite. Will I come again? Absolutely. It's a great space for a business lunch in the area, a safe menu overall with some excellent notes and very good charcuterie. It isn't somewhere I'll be rushing back to though. For the price, I'd rather take a day trip to Paris and pop by Gilles Verot's shop in person.",

I got engaged at Daniel and my last meal on earth would be at Daniel. (DB's fine dining restaurant on the Upper East Side, NYC.)My husband and I had many excellent apr\u00e8s-theatre dinners at Bar Bouloud in NYC, so visiting Bar Bouloud in London on a similar occasion seemed like an obvious choice. (Besides, we were curious to try one of the latest additions to the DB Empire.)Bar Boulud London is very much like Bar Boulud NYC. On steroids!! They have a capacity to seat AT LEAST 200 ppl. (BB NYC has about 75.) Similar menu (with old time favorites like the \"Frenchie Burger\" and \"Coq au Vin\" and artisan sausages) with very similar decor and similar winelist but that's about it. Granted, we went there on a Friday night, but BB resembled a nightclub where they happen to serve food. (That's a serious mistake as Daniel's food is normally as good as it gets. At least in NYC.)I'm not sure if it is the culprit of the location (BB is very unfortunately nested at the Mandarin Oriental at Knightsbridge) but it is the service (from the hostess all the way to the sommelier) that seriously kills it. Honestly, the service could not be more clueless, rude and snotty even if they tried hard. So un-DB. (Truth must be said, the guy who looked after us seemed quite pleasant and I was just thinking to myself, he doesn't really fits with the rest of them.)It might be London, it might be the Mandarin, it might just be the particular night we were here, I'm not sure. To be honest, I'd never come back to find it out considering how many wonderful choices there are in London. What a disappointment.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Daniel Boulud is pretty much a superstar of the USA dining scene. He can lay claim to being the chef patron of many an acclaimed restaurant and his 3 Michelin starred Daniel in New York (a darling of The New York Times - it has received 4 stars from 3 successive critics no less than 5 times since 1986) was recently ranked 8th in San Pelligrino's World's 50th best restaurants. (The Greedy Diva had a solid but slightly less dazzling experience there in 2008 - which I'm sure has The New York Times thinking twice.) And now Monsieur Boulud has pitched his flag in the heart of London. I had my table booked before you could say \"steak fri...\". While M. Boulud was born in Lyon, which plays a heavy influence on the food at hand, Bar Boulud has a swanky, New York feel (the music on it's website says it all). Sister to New York's Bar Boulud, the London bistro decor is intended to be a modern interpretation of a wine bar. Elegant, sleek and sexy, there's a zinc bar, oak panelling and wooden floors (intended to be reminiscent of wine barrels), chandeliers, and swathes of red leather (intended to \"conjure the warm depths of a delicious Burgundy\" - the hint was lost on me at the time, but I suppose I get it in hindsight). Overall, the decor is fairly understated - it's not going to bowl you over before you taste anything. The classic French bistro menu holds much to allure. We took longer than usual deliberating over so many appealing options - the Boudin Blanc truffled white sausage with mashed potato is calling me, but so is the beetroot with horseradish and hazelnut, the fish soup and the coq au vin. But then what about the signature charcuterie plates from renowned charcutier, Gilles Verot - such as the Lapin de Garrigue - Provencal pulled rabbit, carrot, courgette and herbs terrine? Tempting. In the end, we opt for the \u00a320 menu prix fixe (we'll come back again if we like it), before my deliciously oaky Marsanne steals the last shred of my decision making ability (Andre Perret, Marsanne, Vin De Pays Des Collines Rhodaniennes 2007 - \u00a36.50 - absolutely lovely). I start with the luxurious rabbit terrine with cornichons and cocktail onions, toasted bread and a hearty mustard. Elegant and wantonly good, the 2 Frenchmen on the table next door have a serve each, then order another to share. Oui. The Peanut Gallery starts light, with the Salade de Roquette - rocket salad, garlic confit toast, stewed tomato, tapenade and buffalo mozzarella. Each element is nice enough, although, not surprisingly, there's nothing here to showcase the kitchen's real strengths. TPG is pacing himself. I'm still in some shock over his choice here, but if we're looking for that silver lining, it certainly gives us just one extra excuse to come back for a face to face with the Boudin Blanc. (Can you tell that it's still playing on my mind?). It's hard to go past the chance to devour a New York style burger - it's been a while. We both order the DBGB Yankee Burger - a grilled beef patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, sesame brioche bun, cheese pickle and fries (\u00a313 with cheese on the a la carte menu). In this price bracket, it's got to compete with my beloved burgers at Hawksmoor and Goodman. It does. It might be the messiest thing I've eaten for some time (think shredded lettuce in a train wreck), but this baby is the closest thing I've had to that much sought after, but highly elusive, US style burger in London. It's reminiscent of Shake Shake (and this, for me, is a mighty accomplishment). But it's loftier, even if there's a little too much foliage. The meat is loosely packed, moist and sumptuously flavourful and mine at least was perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. Surprisingly, TPG's patty was a little more well done than mine. (But I still didn't share). The accompanying thin cut fries were are good as they looked. On the a la carte menu, the Frenchie Burger comes with confit pork belly as well as the beef patty and there's a Piggy Burger with a beef patty and BBQ pulled pork. While these other combos sound tempting, the flavour of the beef can really sing in the classic DBGB Yankee burger. Quite satisfied, I could eat no more than 2 scoops of refreshing mint ice-cream and a decadent chocolate sorbet. More could be made of the sugary biscuit in between if they're going to bother at all. TPG finished with the Gateau Basque - custard cake with brandied cherries (\u00a36). The cherries packed a strong punch, but the custard cake itself was boring and dry with a hint of orange that didn't succeed in lifting it out of the doldrums. Disappointing. Next time, I'll be trying the freshly baked madeleines (\u00a34 - if they're the same ones we had at Daniel, they're divine) or the macaroons (\u00a35) - among other things. We finish with a sweet Domain De Trapadis, Rasteau 2007 (\u00a39) (rich, grape juice",

So my friend and i had to settle for a French lunch.The place is classy ... you feel the elegance everywhere. One thing i noticed was the extraordinarily high staff to table ratio. We had a reservation for 12 noon when most of the tables were empty. So we did see dozens of staff members just whiling away with apparently nothing to do.We went for the set menus ... the two course version costs \u00a316 while its \u00a320 for three courses. For the first course both of us had terrine made of leg of lamb. The dish was borderline raw meat, and i am not a big fan of meat that is not well cooked. But this one was great. Minced lamb has always been one of my favourite foods and to have a brilliantly made meat loaf made of it was a great experience.For the main course i had a tagliatelle pasta with lamb bolognese. I was surprised as i was under the impression that bolognese sauce was invariably made from beef. However this variation proved to be a very good choice. The pasta was excellent. My friend had a dish of chicken breast. The chicken looked dry but was actually quite juicy, and it was served with cubical pieces of bacon. Every dish had been interesting so far ... i was beginning to love this place :)I had a glass of Greek white wine (my little contribution towards helping them tide over their debt crisis) while my friend was \"persuaded\" to order an expensive red worth \u00a314 per glass (he asked for suggestions ... he deserved what he got). The red was thick, with a strong odour. The white was milder. For dessert, i had a Muscat de Rivesaltes, which was quite good, while my friend went for the chocolate ice-cream (a safe option ... you can't screw up chocolate, can you ?).Initially i had thought that the portion sizes were small ... but i was wrong, proven by the fact that i was full at the end of the meal.The service was excellent, right from taking my jacket to returning it. We did finish our lunch quickly, in less than one hour and a half, but unlike some of the other reviewers here, i never felt rushed. With drinks and service, we paid about \u00a337 per head. Based on the location and ambience, i am sure they can charge much more. We did save by going for the set menus, but even a-la-carte wouldn't have cost much more as many of the main courses were priced in the teens.Another interesting aspect of Bar Boulud was the many options that i found in chicken and lamb. This is a French restaurant which even my parents would like (they don' t eat pork or beef).I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. Next time i plan to try some of the American dishes (mostly burgers and steaks) on the menu. I have all the excuses i need for returning to the 89th best restaurant in the world :)",

Located in the heart of Knightsbridge with its own private entrance at ground level of the prestigious Mandarin Oriental hotel, it's as one would expect, very classy bar/restaurant. I arrived at about 8pm, and there was a nice atmosphere, not too overly crowded, we all managed to get seats at the bar. Dress-wise, there was a mix of people in suits to those more casually dressed. I came smart/casual - skinny jeans and high heels, but my friends braved the cold in their little black dresses. It's a really nice place to catch up with friends or go out on a date, and conveniently moments from Knightsbridge underground station. Would like to go back and try the food next time...",

    "text": "On my venture to taste London's best burgers, I finally made it to Bar Boulud in Knightsbridge. It's a beautiful simple room with nice warm colours and very friendly and attentive staff. Speaking about staff, the sheer number of staff is almost scary, but as all are very obliging, I did not really mind.I started with a really great Trinity Hill, Viognier, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand 2008, a delicious white wine that reminded me a lot of dry Rieslings. For the food, I chose the Frenchie burger. To be fair, it is not a very large burger. But that's probably a good thing. I agree with many others, this burger deserves a mention in any top list. The taste is rich, the bun doesn't dissolve half way through the burger and I cannot think of much that would make this burger better. The Pommes Frittes, as they call it, are thin and crispy, well seasoned and a good complement to the burger. The strawberry dessert was simply amazing, the pastry \u00a0that was mainly for the eye anyway, but nice and crunchy \u00a0even came with some gold on top! Whether it was gold or not, you clearly pay for it. But I have to say, it's worth every penny! To finish off, I ordered an espresso. I didn't expect too much, and I didn't get too much. It is really a pity, that almost no restaurant offers decent coffee. So unfortunately, the last impression was by far not as positive as the rest. After all, I definitely recommend Bar Boulud. It's a very nice place, the food is great, the wine delicious, the staff friendly, and if you don't order an espresso but go straight for a walk in Hyde Park, you will perhaps have a perfect time there!",

    "text": "Bar Boulud is pushing the bar for burgers in London just for a bit higher with some innovative creations, epic attention to detail that really shines through in the taste and texture of the meat, and a high level of service to back it up.Bar Boulud was the location for the latest Yelp BurgerQuest, picked for its appearance on several top 10 lists on London's burger blogs and the fabled BB burger topped with foie gras and coming in just shy of \u00a320. It's a posh place (located below the Mandarin Oriental Hotel) with a suitably luxurious d\u00e9cor. It's burgers are no less fancy with all four offerings being based on a bespoke beef patty. But is it any good? The short answer is yes, yes it is. From the Yankee to the Frenchie and of course the BB, the burgers are very tasty with one of the best patties in London and a solid set of buns to support them.Two important things we learned are 1) groups of more than 4 need to book several weeks in advance to have a chance of sitting near let along with each other, and 2) NO PICTURES!Anyways, we eventually got seated and the night properly began. Our waiter was pretty cool and, despite being fairly new, really put in a lot of effort to make sure we had everything we needed and also answer all the questions we threw at him. Mr. de Tarso also spent quite a lot of time with us over the course of the night to discuss his vision for Bar Boulud and also a bit of his personal history. He's worked with some of the top names in London and is a fairly impressive chef in his own right. At this point, I need to disclose that we didn't have a completely typical experience as Mr. de Tarso was kind enough to send some free charcuterie plates (as they say, you really know a chef by how he puts together a plate of meat) and some fresh madelines for dessert. Now I'd love to think it's because we demonstrated an obvious passion for food and thus inspired Mr. de Tarso to ensure we tried the best Bar Boulud had to offer. But, the smart money is on the fact that we let slip at the start that we were all Yelpers. If the latter is the cause, I attribute it to Alex S's (Yelp London Community Manager) efforts to really put Yelp out there above its competition. Regardless, there was free food, and it was good.The BB burger is average sized with a fluffy soft white bun, the aforementioned patty, seared foie gras, and red-wine braised short rib. It's a bit tall and may prove a challenge for those who can't unhinge their jaw, but each bite is full of tasty meat and soaked bun. I give extra points as the bun actually holds together for the entire burger despite the copious amount of juice running out with each bite. The foie gras was delicious on its own but was lost in the taste of the combined burger. At best, it added a bit more richness to the whole thing but it was a poor value-add. The braised short rib was likewise a bit lost in the overall combination although it did add more textures to the burger which was sorely needed. I could have eaten it as a side dish alone though, absolutely brilliant flavours and tender shredded meat. Overall, a pretty good burger but not quite worth the nearly \u00a320 price tag. At \u00a312-15, I'd be quite happy and perhaps if they took off the foie gras they could do just that.Finally desserts! We started with the mini-madelines as ordered by Mr. de Tarso which were brilliant. Light and airy with a slight lemony flavour, they are very moreish and incredibly hard to put down. And when you dip them in hot chocolate sauce then you pretty much won't bother stopping until they are all gone (I know that's what I did). The chocolate tart was my next favourite with a \u00a0deep bitter chocolate although the chocolate sauce soaked sponge was a close second (or third rather). Finally, for a bit of freshness, we managed to take down a pineapple souffl\u00e9 and a mango mouse. Both were light and refreshing and a great option if you feel stuffed from your meal but still want dessert.Overall, an excellent experience and a definite burger win. I only wish we could have taken some photos but perhaps Mr. de Tarso will be kind enough to send some professionally taken ones for us to use. Get over to Bar Boulud (make a reservation first), and try the the Piggy or Frenchie burger for a good time. And a special thank you to Mr. de Tarso for being an absolutely brilliant host - he even got a waiter to teach us how to fold a napkin into a bowl for serving madelines!",

    "text": "Went to Bar Boulud to check out the lamb burger specially created for their one year anniversary. I'd been meaning to go to BB for a while, but never quite managed to find the time. This time around, the fact that the lamb burger was only going to be around for a week enticed me to come down, even though I was not able to find a dining companion at such short notice. Despite the fact that I was on my own and a small eater, the service I received was impeccable. Batiste, my waiter, introduced the special (the lamb burger) right after handing me the menu and helped me choose a nice wine to go with it. I also asked whether I needed to order a side to go with my burger order, and he said, no, as he thought the burger was quite 'significant' in size. I'd read a couple of reviews that said the burgers were a little on the small side but as Batiste mentioned that the kitchen could turn out sides in double-quick time if I thought the burger wasn't big enough, decided to just go with the burger. And a good thing I did! I'll just say that the burger didn't look that big, but I had to take a break midway because I was getting really full! The lamb was good, not gamey, while the chickpea fries were a delightful surprise. I really wanted to give the desserts a go, but, as you might have guessed, that simply wasn't possible. Contrary to popular belief, sometimes, there simply isn't space for dessert. I mentioned it earlier but I simply need to mention it again. The service is incredible. The staff checked on me several times during the course of my meal, but not too many times as to make me uncomfortable. My water glass was topped up almost the instant it was emptied, and my dishes were cleared in an efficient manner. Batiste was also friendly and smiley to all of the tables he served at all times. I'll have to come back another time to try out the regular burgers. I strongly suspect I'll enjoy the Piggie Burger given my love of all things pork. But, first, I'll need several weeks of gym visits, and a friend to eat here with so that we can order more food!",

The restaurant just opened a couple of weeks ago, but so far, after dining here 3 times, I'm definitely a fan. The food is solid - excellent charcuterie (my favorite is the Pate Grandpere made with the creamy bits of foie gras), beautifully rich Boudin Blanc, excellent grilled lamb chops, a delightful fresh shellfish platter featuring periwinkles, langoustine, lobster, crab, king prawns, tuna tartare, whelks, clams, and mussels, and a superb wine list. The decor is not my favorite - there is something about the mix of maroon red colors that is a little off-putting, and the artwork on the walls that are supposed to be different types of wine spilled onto white tablecloths and framed, look more like.. well to be perfectly frank... women's used maxi pads hanging on the walls. But the service and food more than make up for the odd decor.The prices are surprisingly reasonable as well considering it is smack dab in the middle of Knightsbridge, AND in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.",

Deliciously fragrant!!All staff were attentive and either authentically french or had excellent french speaking accents :)We left around 11.30pm and people were still arriving for dinner on a Monday night so I'm guessing this place is popular anytime of the day or night.",

    "text": "Wow, what an incredible evening. At the next instalment of our 'Burger Club', we just had to try the legendary BB at Bar Boulud*. With its origins in New York, this is a burger of 18 years fame! Situated in the beautiful Mandarin Oriental Hotel, this is a lovely space and from the second you walk in, you can tell these people know their stuff and service is of paramount importance. We had the pleasure of meeting maitre d' Paulo De Tarso, the main man formally of The Wolesley and Scotts, who set up this entire place. He was truly a delight, highly knowledgable and treated us like family. We discovered Paulo is a more than a bit of a respected \u00a0celebrity in restaurant circles so it was lovely of him to spend so much time with us describing his ethos for the restaurant and how much attention goes into each dish. We started with the charcuterie board and were won over by the flavours of the terrines from lamb terrine to coarse country foie gras. As always cured meats are my favourite, I couldn't get enough of the different flavours and textures of this board. Try them all! As was the theme of the evening, everyone ordered the burgers, 3 BBs and a Piggie. We had to go for all the sides, truffled mash, mushroom fricassee, cauliflower gratin and of course, fries! The burger was a revelation, the most moist, tender patty you could ever bite into. I wasn't relishing enough enjoyment from the foie gras in the burger, so I began spreading it on the bread provided and that was divine! Back to the burger to really taste each part then, the highlight of the BB is the combination of the braised short rib with the foie gras sitting on an unusual black sesame seed bun. \u00a0Sides are almost always my favourite, maybe because I used to be a vegetarian. But I could have eaten that truffled mash all day long. It was decadent! Same for the gratin. Of course, we were a greedy table and ordered a round of desserts. At a place like Boulud, how can you not?! Coconut crusted pineapple souffl\u00e9 with coconut ice cream, this was like eating a fluffy delicious cloud of air. Andrew had the coffee and bittersweet chocolate tart - this was decadent and divine. Maybe too rich to eat a whole one, but I was too taken with my coupe peppermint, a flourless sponge topped with mint chocolate icecream and a chocolate 'lid' that melted when poured over with chocolate sauce. Hello! Paulo then treated us to fresh baked madeleines, straight from the oven. What a delight. Light, airy and with a hint of citrus, I think they may have been the highlight of the meal for me. This was truly a fantastic experience and we were wowed by the charm of Bar Boulud. If you are looking for something special or have someone special to treat, take them here! * Boulud had actually been on my list to try for quite some time.",

The burger was the perfect size. Quality of meat was good. It was cooked evenly, not the half raw, half burnt, interpretations of MED rare I've run across. The bun did not take away from the flavor of the burger and foie gras. I had the roasted veg as a side and downed a Bellenrose to wash it all down. It was a good day.",

On top of all that we were able to get a booking on 20 minutes notice. The prices are reasonable; in theory, you could get in, get a burger, and get out, with change from 20 bucks or the UK equivalent. Of course with all the good stuff available it's likely to go a bit higher, and take a bit longer.",

Pulled Pork, Green Chili Mayo, Bibb Lettuce, Red Cabbage Slaw, and a Cheddar Bun all combined for too many textures and flavors going on. The interesting fact here is that none of them stood out and the burger was lacking any salt/acid to give it that mouth watering effect. The burger was also quite tall and difficult to handle/enjoy while eating. Overall, the Piggie has potential however it seems to be a little confused about what it is trying to do. I'd suggest subbing the lettuce for fried onion strings and topping the burger with a healthy dose of vinegar based BBQ sauce.",

So disappointed that I've lost my last bit of faith in this place. my pork belly was so overcooked that it tasted like leather, fish was way fishy, pate was half frozen, sausage tasted frosty.. and most of all, service was crappy. Mandarin Oriental's are normally great with services. Except for this one.. for some reason I've witnessed more customer dispute and unsatisfactory comment at this particular MO than anywhere else in the world.So yeah, the one star is the one redeeming quality for this restaurant and it all goes to the christmas dinner from last year.

It would have been really great to experience the restaurant without the \"extra attention\" for lack of a better term.Either way, the burgers are quite amazing. The juice and crumble of the patty is outstanding. I do wish that they had less patty and more toppings though! The pork belly was severely skimmpy on the toppings.",

I've been a handful of times and if you don't book, then there will often be a wait. I went on a Monday evening and it was packed. The consolation is having cocktails by the bar whilst waiting for your table.Of course I went for the burgers, which are on most of the top 10 London burger lists. In fact I have never tried anything else off their menu, although the other food looks great too. Burgers are good-patty is well cooked. Perhaps I am fussy, but I think there is too much bun in proportion to the burger, which obscures the taste of the patty a little for me. It's simple enough not to eat both halves of the bun though.Burgers are \u00a311.75/12.75 except for the foie gras burger. Chips are extra. This is great value for a good food eaten in a lovely environment.We returned a burger because it was overcooked. A perfectly cooked replacement was brought without fuss, in super quick time, and with a free side of chips.Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, in the very same hotel, could learn a thing or two from this place- but that is for another review.",

I had a better French food elsewhere especially for the price. I must admit I enjoyed the freshness, quality and the presentation of the food here. In addition, I commend the service here (it better be excellent as it is part of high service charge paid the mister).

The fried calamari rings looked shriveled and sad and the breaded scallops were rubbery, indicative of being over cooked. Loved the cocktails. I tried the Venezuelan old fashioned and give it 2 thumbs up.",

    "text": "Thanks to Andrew M for organising Burger Quest 4.0, which turned out to be one of my oddest dining experiencesBar Boulud is the brainchild of Michelin starred New York legendary chef Daniel Boulud and has been reproduced in London from its original version in New York. Senior maitre d' Paulo de Tarso, which eventually turned our evening into a special one, told us the origins of the London version from its humble basement beginnings at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel in KnightsbridgeTo be honest, the evening didn't start well. The first 4 of our party of 10 Yelpers arrived to find that they had split us up into tables of 4,4 and 2 and that they were unable to sit us close together. Having now spent an evening in the buzzing and impressively full dining rooms, I'm still not sure why our tables couldn't be placed closer togetherThe other unfortunate policy at the restaurant is that no photo taking is allowed, especially of the food. At the end of the evening, we all agreed that it was a real shame that they didn't allow us to take photos of the food, which was beautifully plated and presented. A little bizarrely, they did offer to let us return to photograph the food with professional photographers and they would set up the food professionally, which rather goes against the spontaneous joy of Yelp. I really hope that they re-consider this policy as I, in common with a lot of others I'm sure, have chosen to eat somewhere when we've seen the beautiful photos of the foodHowever, once Mr de Tarso worked out that we were serious foodies, he did put in a lot of time with us to share his obvious passion for the food and to make sure that we had an enjyable evening. He was the perfect hostWe had some nice cocktails to sip on - my non alcoholic 'Exotic Breeze' was a nice combination of lychee juice, fresh berries and tonic - as we perused the menuVery generously, Mr de Tarso sent over some complimentary charcuterie boards as he wanted us to try the terrines, which reflects Daniel Boulud's rustic origin and style of cooking though elevating it to perfect execution and appearance. Despite it having a bistro air in the dining room, they don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients or cookingThe many terrines and hams on the board weren't shy on flavour, which was nice. The mustards served alongside added some lovely bite but the pickled veggies could have had a little more zingBeing Burger Quest, we all went for burgers. I had already decided beforehand on their signature BB burger which is a beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, fris\u00e9e, horseradish mayonnaise and confit tomato all on a sesame black onion seed bun, costing a reasonable \u00a319.50 considering the top class ingredients. Yinnie C bucked the trend on our table by having the Piggie burger, which was personally recommended by Mr de TarsoSo, the BB. It was very good but just a couple of notches from perfection. The beef patty is made in-house with a carefully measured ratio of fat to meat and this results in a wonderfully light patty. The foie gras and short ribs were nice too but as all these main filling ingredients are of the same consistency and flavour, everything just merged into an amorphous mouthful, nice though it tasted. I felt the foie gras was wasted in this mix and extracted it to be eaten separately. Similarly, the truffle was a bit lost in the meat feast. Linzi M had requested no horseradish in her burger and I did wonder if they leff it off mine as well as it did lack a little bit of different texture or a a little kick, which would have elevated it into the great divisionHowever, Yinnie's Piggie burger was a little star. With the addition of barbecued pulled pork and chilli mayo, it had interesting contrasts on the palateHappily, the truffle in the truffle mash was more obvious and was my favourite side. The fries, mushroom fricasee and cauliflower cheese gratin were good fillers but not in the same classSomehow, we found space for a dessert each. These were yummy. We had a nice range with pineapple souffle, chocolate tart, peppermint chocolate sponge and mango with orange mousseMr de Tarso had a last surprise for us with a batch of mini madelaines fresh from the oven. Though we were stuffed by then, these all disappeared and I even spotted some fellow Yelpers pouring chocolate sauce into them!So a big thanks to Mr de Tarso for being a perfect host and making our visit special",

    "text": "This was my best restaurant experience during my recent trip to London. The atmosphere at the restaurant is wonderful: ritzy but comfortable. The decor is an eclectic mix of old and new, antique and industrial. I loved it from the moment I walked in. My party of 3 was seated by 3 waiter--one to pull out each of our chairs. From the point of seating we were perfectly attended to all evening. My water glass was never empty and our bread basket was always full of a delicious mix of fresh, warm, breads. I had the fruit de mer grilles--a mixed grill of scallop, octopus, prawn, heritage tomatoes, lobster croquette, and basil mayonnaise. For dinner I had the volaille rotie-- a chicken breast perfectly prepared with polenta, roasted peppers, feta, charred courgette, and harissa vinaigrette. For dessert (of course I had dessert!) I had souffle baie des ronces--an incredibly light raspberry souffl\u00e9 with thick tangy raspberry jam in the bottom of the ramekin and a side of fresh, nutty pistachio ice cream. Others in my group tried the sole limande--a whole roasted lemon sole with brown butter and lemon and capers (it's typically served on the bone, but she requested it boned and it came completely boneless). And one person had the Prix Fixe 3-course meal and adored every course. Everything was perfect: the atmosphere, the temperature in the restaurant, the staff and service, the timing of the meal, the drinks, the food (OMG the food!), and the desserts. I am dying to go to the Bar Boulud in NYC now and cannot wait to go to London and eat at this Bar Boulud again. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.",

    "text": "Clean and classy with top quality food and a suckerpunch of a 5 star customer service experience is exactly what this restaurant is all about. Ambience/D\u00e9cor:The way in which I can describe the ambience and d\u00e9cor within this restaurant would be of a subtle nature. The restaurant (in my own opinion) is in a league of its own with having the ability to be well lit, calm, peaceful and down to earth, yet also possessing the qualities of having an air of elegance, class and of high quality to it's list of ways to describe the experience and memories it leaves with you.Food/Dessert:Due to having a semi full stomach, I decided to skip the starter and head straight for the main.For the main course, I had one of the notoriously talked about burgers, the \"BB\" burger which consisted of: the beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, fris\u00e9e, horseradish mayonnaise, confit tomatoes and black onion seed bun. I can honestly agree with all past reviewers about why the burger is London's best. The beef patty, foie gras and the ribs all complimented each other. The burger had a unique and overly satisfying taste. It is of decent size, packs in a lot of ingredients, flavours and good quality beef patty with it being filling, yet won't leave your stomach bursting with agony. I would definitely \u00a0recommend this to anyone who knows about good quality burgers.For dessert I had the 'Coulant Au Chocolat' which consisted of a chocolate lava cake, raspberry sorbet and vanilla milk. What a collaboration of flavours and textures. This dessert is just one of those desserts that is better tried than described. The warmth and sponge like texture of the cake with the flow of hot chocolate mixture pouring out of it is to die for. It is sweet well baked and having the raspberry sorbet on the side is definitely a plus. The raspberry gives you a wake up call and definitely shockwaves your tastebuds back into action with it cold temperature and raspberry sour kick flavour. Great portion and really closes the meal in the best way possible. Price:I guess there is not much to say really apart from you get what you pay for. What I can say though is if you want a meal that is like an experience then that is sure what you are paying for. On the plus side, I didn't think the pricing was expensive at all and the food was by far definitely worth it.Customer Service:It is rare to receive such customer service that has you talking about it for days. The waiters & waitresses really show that they care about ensuring you get the best experience possible. The waitress who served on the day I attended was very informative about the menu, very patient and engaged in general conversation. Customer service is just one of those things tjat in order to understand, you have to experience ir yourself, but, being an active restaurant diner, I have seen my fair share of customer service and yet still, when you receive a new moment of excellent customer service it does leave you in awe.***Non-pretentious, chic, elegant and top quality restaurant serving top quality food with the sprinkle of excellent customer service in a modern building in the heart of London is where you need to be. Bar Bould is the restaurant where you need to be.***",

    "text": "Burger Quest 4.0 has descended upon Bar Boulud and have also left with lighter wallet. The minute we walked in, it was clear that these people were serious about their food, and they only seem to serve tables of 4 and under because it means it is more intimate. So as a party of ten, we split into 4,4 and 2! Also no photos of the food please. It is THAT serious and crazy classy. The Maitre d' Paulo de Tarso (who has a 'small' following of 200,000 followers on twitter) was lovely, he talked to us about the beginnings of Bar Boulud and how passionate he was about the place since, he has a major hand in opening and managing the place, starting from it's basement origins. We also had the pleasure of trying the charcuterie board, and I totally agree with Linzi M, the foiegras and lamb terrine STOLE the show on that board. The Jambon Ham was also quite nice. They also had a pork and parsley terrine and a rabbit terrine as well. (Veggies look away!) Then, the burgers came, the beacon of our travels across, uhm, London. 3 BBs and My Piggie Burger. Although I did sample their shortribs and foiegras on top of their patty and it was so rich and so good. I polished off my piggie burger is fast timing too. The Chilli Mayo on top of my pulled pork and beef patty with the sour tang of the red cabbage slaw lifted was was a good burger to a great burger. It had a kick, it was medium rare and it had the extra juicyness of the pulled pork. AND I DIDN'T GET ANY ON MY WHITE TOP. WIN.Since we pretty much shared EVERYTHING on the table, the sides were no different. But,the sides were hit and miss, which is why I had to knock a star off. The fries weren't great, B+L does better chips. The Mushroom fricasee, had great flavour but was really oily at the bottom. The great sides were the truffle mash,and the cauliflower cheese gratin. We went ALL OUT, and ordered desserts. And, the desserts were special, like Linzi's Peppermint chocolate dessert is something I'll order again, it's got a really unique taste, and it worked so well. and it came with hot chocolate sauce. LOVE! Yee Gan's Souffle was super super light and hot pineapple and coconut ice cream ALWAYS works. The chocolate tart that Andrew ordered was decadent and I'm glad we shared! My mango saffron crumble was light but the biscuit at the bottom really changed the dynamics of the dessert. I got dessert envy from Linzi's dish FOR SURE. And the madeleines, how could I forget the ones that were BETTER than paris. These were light, and fluffy and just too cute. AND added bonus to the staff who showed me how to the do the basket. (3 times 1 side and 2 times the other and then pull up from the bottom) Don't judge me, I am an origami freak!I am meated out though. Beef Patty/pulled pork/meat board. I was like, my arteries are clogging up on the train ride home. LOL",

Because they offer the choice of \"petite plates\", we decide to order several small plates to try as many dishes as possible instead of two or three large ones. So we end up ordering eight dishes--two real appetizers and six petite entrees. It turns out, I'd say, the petite ones are actually in good sizes(compared to those entrees served in similar high-end French restaurants) , especially the mussels!!! Among all the plates we order -- scallions, prawns, sausages, pork belly, chicken oysters, mussels and crab rolled in cucumber, I really recommend pork belly, scallions and crab rolled in cucumber, the last one is creative too in the way they make it. So if you ever have he chance to be in London, find a time to try out this nice restaurant in mandarin oriental hotel near Harrods.",

So what better way to do this than with a glass of bubbly or two!In total I and my companion spent about 5 hours drinking, eating, chatting, \u00a0people watching and getting checked out (I'll come back to that - stay tuned.)We opened with glasses of champagne and was convinced by our waiter that our afternoon drinks would be incomplete without some petite madeleine, which are small shell shaped cakes, dusted with icing sugar. They were light fluffy and warm. Mmmm, just delightful!After more hours of more champagne and talking, we thought it would be rude to leave without having dinner, plus I had heard that the burgers were pretty good. I opted for the Piggie - beef burger with a pulled pork crown, but I was a little disappointed as there really wasn't that much piggy in the Piggie and certain not enough to make a difference to the taste. Still, the beef was as I requested it, a gorgeous medium rare, could have perhaps done with a little more seasoning, but overall nice cow.Needing to wash the cow juice from my hands I popped to the ladies and needed to walk through the restaurant, and who was drinking in my form, but a German ginger sports man. Being a married man I think it's only fair that I do not disclose his identity, but I will say I'm just glad I was nowhere near a broom cupboard!",

Each entry stated the case for the burger and was accompanied by a picture to illustrate its worthiness.The Boulud offering jumped out and clearly warranted a visit by me and a fellow burger lover.There are three burger choices at Bar Boulud:YANKEEDespite both of us being Yanks, the iceberg lettuce featured on this hamburgerand the fact that it didn't have any other redeeming or fun toppings summarily reduced its appeal.FRENCHIEWhat's not to love about confit pork belly, rocket and tomato-onion compote on a peppered brioche bun? PIGGIEPulled pork atop a patty just seems like overkill, no?Of course, we went with the Frenchie. In an attempt to tamp down our gluttony we ordered one to share. Along with the fries, it made a nice, not too terribly heavy lunch for two.As we waited for our Frenchie to arrive, we watched the professional kitchen with rapt attention. This operation is firing on all cylinders and frankly reminded me of kitchens I've usually only seen in New York and occasionally, San Francisco. I loved the buzz coming out of there.The restaurant's interior is a little too tricked out for a burger but man, what a burger it was - juicy, true medium rare, umami busting at the seams. The flavours were harmonious and the fries were phenomenal. Not much more you can ask for, really.Knightsbridge may not be the most obvious choice for a burger, but if you find yourself in the area craving one you'd be crazy not to come to Bar Boulud.",

The BB was the best for both of us - A beef patty, with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes and black onion served on a seed bun. You can appreciate the quality of the ingredients used and they are cooked to perfection but both burgers could have done with more flavour and 'wow' factor. Especially for the price!",

The amuse bouche distiller all such flavors into a spirit lifting broth of white bean and white truffle soup. It's steamy heat enlivened me from the outside chill.   For my first course, I had a delectable duck / pistachio \u00a0terrine served with a spoonful of cranberry jam and miniature ginger bread biscuits. I paired this with a dry burgundy. New rule - I serve duck terrine at all my parties. I zeroed in on my second course from the word short-rib without realizing it came with a rib-eye steak as well. These meats were accompanied with a compressed spinach packet and the cutest potato dauphine. We had a glass of a 1995 Bordeaux with this richer course.  For dessert I had buch du Noel for the first time, though I've fantasizes about this holiday treat since my 8th grade introductory French class. Was the stuff of dreams!",

The occasion was my birthday, so we ordered a fairly priced bottle of Ayala champagne. I started with the escargots, cooked simply with butter and garlic - and accompanied with potatoes dauphin, which were like little balls of mash heaven. That was followed by the sirloin steak with lightly creamed spinach and a salade fris\u00e9e. The steak was cooked to perfection and oh-so tasty and juicy. My mum had the boudin noir, with mashed potatoes and sliced apple - and she said it was delectable. But the best part of the meal was the dessert. We were both so full, but our server, the funny and charming Thibault, encouraged me to choose something , as he knew I was celebrating my birthday. So I chose the madeleines - and good lord they were incredible. Thibault told us they're not baked until they're ordered, so they arrived warm and fluffy and amazingly tasty, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Oh my gosh they were just out of this world. Definitely recommend this place, birthday or not. I did like that they didn't sing to me. Thibault quietly but sincerely placed a plate in front of me, garnished with \"Happy Birthday Jennifer\" in chocolate, along with a chocolate cupcake and a small candle. Right up my alley. Bravo!",

I thought it was absolutely delicious.The staff make you feel so comfortable, \u00a0they take your coats, pull out your chairs and are there for your every need. The decor is remarkable and the food is absolutely amazing (in my opinion), I would love to go here again anyway.The reason I have not given this venue a 5 star rating, is due to the area (Knightsbridge) it is very pricey, well for me being a student it is anyway. For two of us, with a starter and a main course it cost us 100 pounds for the meal. However, as it was my friends birthday, he did get a small cake free! With his name on which was really sweet. Would recommend to anyone that likes to try out different cuisines or has a taste for French food. It was a pleasure being there and I would go again if I could afford.",

    "text": "- the Bar Boulud is the sister restaurant to the popular New York outpost- located at Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park- reservation is highly recommended! very busy and popular- the service staff is impeccable, from the front door staff to the barman to our waiter; very very obliging, friendly and alert staff!!- great atmosphere, nice interiors (sleek open kitchen, vaulted ceilings, red-leather banquettes and zinc-topped bar create a comfortable and welcoming surrounding); however, very narrow seating (this is really a minus!)- the seasonal bistro menu includes an impressive selection of house-made terrines and p\u00e2t\u00e9s, as well as a handful of signature sausages and burgers, adding an American touch to this French inflected bistro and wine bar- the wine list focuses on Burgundy and the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, including many fine selections by the glass, as well as a wide array of draught and bottled beers- starter: \"CHARCUTERIE DE GILLES VEROT\": chef's selection of p\u00e2t\u00e9s terrines,sliced meats, hors d'oeuvres, pickles & mustards (small 16.00 GBP | large 32.00 GBP); delicious!

    "text": "Bar Boulud is just one outpost of renowned chef, Daniel Boulud's empire. \u00a0The French chef, who is originally from Lyon in the Rhone River valley, became famous in New York after moving there in the early 80s. \u00a0Boulud's centerpiece - three Michelin star restaurant DANIEL is located in NYC - but his empire spans the globe with locations in Florida, Singapore, Beijing, Montreal, Toronto and London. Bar Boulud sits in the ground floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel, one of the poshest addresses in London's Knightsbridge area.The Boulud American-inspired French bistro concept is a majorly relaxed and welcoming environment. And unlike many other restaurants in this price range, it attracts people who aren't dressed to the nine's and just want a chilled out, but very nice meal. \u00a0The slightly-underground Bar Boulud is designed to feel like a French wine cellar with vaulted ceilings and recessed, red-leather booths. \u00a0It's open kitchen does make things more lively than your average wine cellar.I, of course, had the burger. \u00a0Bar Boulud features four delicious burgers on their regular menu, priced between \u00a317 and \u00a324. Now, this is pricey - it's prohibitively pricey. \u00a0And considering just a few short years back, the Boulud burgers were priced between \u00a313-19, Boulud has realized that there is money to be made in a delicious hamburger. \u00a0However, I do say that these burgers are worth it - considering the Hawksmoor burger for \u00a315 without fries; Bar Boulud includes the pommes frites, and it's on par with Hawksmoor. \u00a0Boulud's beef comes from the Castle of Mey; aged Aberdeen Angus Cross chuck steak (grass and silage fed from the North of Scotland).Their burgers include: the Yankee (\u00a317) - a classic beef burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on the homemade glazed brioche bun. \u00a0The Frenchie (\u00a319) is topped with confit pork belly, tomato, and dijon on a morbier peppered homemade bun. \u00a0The Piggie (\u00a319) piles bbq pork on top of the beef patty and then includes jalapeno mayo and cabbage on a cheddar bun. \u00a0And finally, the pi\u00e9ce de r\u00e9sistance is Boulud's \u00a324 BB: a beef burger with foie gras, short rib meat, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun. \u00a0They also serve up a sampler of three burgers, cut in halves so you and some select friends can divide your attention amongst these four 8oz. burger delights. \u00a0The beef absolutely melts in your mouth and remains the focal point of the experience. \u00a0Even though the house-made buns are exquisite, they are purely a bit-player to the beef. \u00a0Even the toppings, though fresh and wonderful, are purely there for slight variation, not to overpower the burger patty.You can read my full review here: beeffanatic.com/2015/12/\u2026",

I would actually think it's the best overall restaurant in London, because it's so excellent always, and also because it's a great fit for any occasion - from dinner with your mother, to a work beer, to a romantic date or business dinner. It can be a place to splash out for superb French food and expensive wine (they go up to \u00a3400 per bottle) but also to have probably the best value meal in London (the set menu is simply the best deal in London) with extremely good value wine serviced by the glass. So it's just perfect for any occasion. The French food is superb. Everything is great, from the fine dining cuisine to their burgers, and if you like a bit more rustic country food I can really recommend their sausages.And the service is just always flawless and genuinely friendly and caring. I had a person in my party spill red wine on their expensive cashmere sweater, and one of the waiters solved it with some soda water - it was gone!",

But being a lady of high standards, I want a burger that has real beef inside and I want to eat it in a nice restaurant on a plate. I can't stand plastic wrapping, or themed restaurants that try to pretend they're in America, when you can quite clearly see London buses going past the window.Anyway, rant over, I was so happy with my burger at Bar Boulud. The texture was divine and there was just the right amount of lettuce and tomato with a delicious burger sauce. There are some more adventurous burgers on the menu, including one with foie gras inside, but I stuck to a Yankee burger with cheese and salad. Not that three bits of lettuce can be included as part of your five a day, but it probably saves some calories.Saving calories on the main course is important as you'll want to indulge in a dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake, and held my breath to see if molten chocolate would oooze out as I've had some disappointing experiences with chocolate desserts recently. Thankfully, a river of chocolate flowed over the plate and I spooned up every last drop. A raspberry sorbet cleansed the palate so I could keep going back to the chocolate.Not only was the food divine, but the location was a plus. As it is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, which is just down the road from Harrods and Harvey Nichols, I expected it to be much more expensive than what it was. My Yankee Burger was just \u00a318 though so it was cheaper than Burger and Lobster and some gastropubs. Service was excellent and the clientele were cool and civilised. Next time I'll go back a bit further after Christmas, so my stomach can handle a foie gras burger. It's the poshest setting for a burger I've found in London so far.",

    "text": "This is a very hip, semi-casual place, for young attractive professionals, to come grab drinks and plates to share. The ambiance is lively and happening, in a classy environment. The bartenders behind the large bar, are ready to mix you a drink in a calm and engaging manner. Martinis are stirred, not shaken, and filled all the way up in a large chilled martini glass. I like when my bartender take his job seriously! All about first impression of the establishment. It's packed in here on a Wednesday night, and our large table is ready at 7pm sharp (19:00 Hours). Our French waitress is attentive, and so is the rest of the large wait-staffs. Four appetizers are ordered for the table: The Calamar is good but forgettable. The Petite Friture (Crispy White Baits W/Aioli dressing ) are tasty and a great table conversational piece. The Rillons Croustillants (Crispy Pork Belly on a stick) is a clear winner! The Boudin Noir has a surprising preparation and presentation, as its flat and seared? Innovative, but not rocking my boat... \u00a0Wife and I ordered the Piggie and \"BB\" burgers, to share and taste. Oh boy, they did not disappoint! Juicy and full of flavor of the different ingredients really came through! You know, this BB burger, with a 8oz beef patty, foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes, with black onion seed bun, \u00a0truly is a piece of art! Surprisingly, the food menu is quite extensive, with many proteins and veggies option, with a twist, for entr\u00e9es. The wait staffs pacing furiously the floor back and forth, are visibly stressed. Not sure who's running the front of the house, but this tension should not be shown. It was never brought to our table during the entire meal, as the staff displays warm professionalism and attention, but just pointing my observation...",

When I appartitioned in London last year during Christmas my phantom date and I spent a lot of time in and around Hyde Park. When we walked passed the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, we popped in to take a look around and we happened to notice the adjoined bistro Bar Boulud and their spectacular menu. It wasn't even a question of whether or not we were going to eat there, we immediately manifested ourselves inside. The Phantom is always searching the world for tasty burgers and found absolute perfection Bar Boulud's BB Burger. The BB Burger consisted of 100% UK beef that is ground daily in-house, with foie gras, short ribs, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun; it was worth every bit of \u00a324! My phantom date and I also shared the truffle risotto with delicious foam, our meal was so amazing that we went back in the next day or two for a second round of the same meal. Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere and decoration are extremely sophisticated and modern with a classic touch, it is a very romantic, non-pretentious, classy experience. The waitstaff were all extremely attentive and super friendly. The Phantom is honored to write the 100th review of Bar Boulud!Five Stars for Bar Boulud!barboulud.com/london",

The homemade seaweed butter was a thoughtful addition but did not come close to the same from god of butter, Jean-Yves Bordier. Their sauce am\u00e9ricaine had much more bite and spice than any Heinz replica, a meaty substitute for Tabasco. Frenchie Burger \u00a0\u00a313.75 (includes chips)This is a burger with confit pork belly, rocket tomato-onion compote and Morbier cheese served on a peppered brioche bun. The bun was delicious and a soft peppery pillow for some serious ingredients. The burger was huge and heavy with meaty flavour thanks to the additional porky belly, the nutty Morbier and jammy compote lifting the meat with some huge hits of flavour. There was some additional french mustard in here somewhere which was not listed in the menu. The chips were good, just good, skinny and lots of them but scoring a 6/10. Piggie Burger \u00a0\u00a313.75 (includes chips)This burger is served in a Cheddar bun with bbq pulled pork, Bibb lettuce, green chili mayonnaise and red cabbage slaw. The cheese on the bun was strong and gave a great pungent bite to the beautifully soft pork and then the firm burger. The lettuce, mayo and slaw added softness, heat and crunch so there was lots going on in every mouthful. The pulled pork was so good we would have easily eaten a whole plate of this smothered over the 6/10 chips. Souffl\u00e9 au citron \u00a0\u00a39.50A super light lemon souffl\u00e9 was served with a jug of spiced sugar poire william and vanilla coulis. A bit pricey but was nice enough. \u00cele exotique \u00a0\u00a38.00This dessert was amazing, the lime floating island was filled with a mango cr\u00e9meux and sat on a coconut anglaise. Dotted around the plate were tiny bites of spiced pineapple, pomegranite and basil leaves and little bit of everything on the spoon was divine, it was a random choice but worth the it. Drink1 glass of Nittnaus Pinot Noir 'Kurzberg', Burgenland, Austria (2007) \u00a0\u00a38.501 Sierra Nevada pale ale \u00a0\u00a34.752 Peppermint teas \u00a0\u00a39.00 (they used fresh peppermint but still expensive for water and leaves) AtmosphereWe ate at 6.30pm on a Saturday and there was a great atmosphere with a busy mix of tables, banquets and booths of dates, family meals, groups of friends and single diners. The open kitchen is exciting and honest and adds to the buzz of the diners and staff. Very attentive service keeps you looked after and there is reasonable 2hr 15mins turnaround in place. Plus, as in all good hotels, toilets are clean and attended. OffersThree course set menu meal for \u00a320 served seven days between 12pm-2.30pm and 5.30pm- 7pm VerdictWe will definitely go back to Bar Boulud. The burgers were ordered medium-rare but were served medium so in future we'll ask for rare. The set menu looked excellent value and the location is perfect for popping in when shopping around Knightsbridge. Always book, we saw lots of people being turned away.",

Reviews upon its opening came in thick and fast. Most of the sentiment was positive, though some commented that its interior was devoid of personality. For my part, seated in the bar area on a weekday evening, the place seemed quite lively (this was probably enhanced by the animated and captivating sommelier, who was our unofficial host for the evening) and had a nice buzz to it. The food was generally very good (though desserts were somewhat of a disappointment), the charcuterie was nothing short of spectacular, and the restaurant is not as expensive as you might think. It's a good addition to the neighbourhood and is a clever move from the prolific and successful Franco-American restaurateur...especially given that Heston will be serving 'Dinner' very soon in the same building. BAR FOOD AT BAR BOULUD Food blogging is a peculiar pursuit. You often get invited to events, you sometimes go, and once in a while they are really great. This was one such occasion. I met Heather Cowper at a rather random event hosted by lastminute.com a few months back. This was interesting because she is not a food blogger, but a travel blogger \u00a0another obscure species \u00a0and I had never met one before (I had seen them in cages, though). We had a nice chat and, somehow, I must have not come off as a complete bore and/or tosser. How do I know this? Because when she organized a meal at Bar Boulud (BB) at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park (MO) for a table of bloggers (Krista and Gourmet Chick were also in attendance), she for some inexplicable reason decided to invite yours truly. Laissez fare enough. Pardon the appalling pun-itive damage (gag), but I am stuck in an airport and my plane is more than three hours delayed and ain't leaving until midnight at the earliest. So there. Anyway, back to the task at hand. The big DB and his BB (there are, as of yet, no plans for a BB's Little Brother). From my experiences of his establishments in New York over the years, I like the guy, his food and the way he has his restaurants run. His flagship restaurant has always served excellent food, if a bit safe, and his less formal offshoots are generally very solid as well (check out a great review from Ulterior Epicure of a recent meal at Caf\u00e9 Boulud). For New Yorkers in particular, and to some degree throughout the US, DB has a big profile \u00a0\u00e1 la GR (apt acronym?) in the UK. Along with Danny Meyer, Keith McNally and a few others, he's definitely one of the big players on the Manhattan restaurant scene. So it's interesting that he's decided to give London a shot, especially when so many NY transplants have bombed so quickly. BB has its own entrance on the left side of the MO, if you're facing the building. It's fairly nondescript, so if you didn't know about it and weren't a hotel guest, you'd probably just keep walking, despite the doorman decked out in a black suit. I managed to find it easily enough and, as usual, arrived a bit early, so took a stroll through Harvey Nichol's fifth floor of food and drink (well, I just hung out in the wine department and contemplated their exceedingly good range of Champagne). I just barely managed to get out of there without purchasing anything. Upon entering BB, I wasn't exactly sure who else I'd be dining with, but was lead to a rectangular raised table in the bar area, which afforded me a good view of the front dining room. There were two other bloggers already there who I didn't know (Anthony, who runs the very cool Mr & Mrs Smith travel blog and Eva), making me fashionably not first one to arrive. Before moving on, I would like to clear up one inaccuracy that I've noticed in reports about the restaurant. There are windows, and they do provide some natural light \u00a0granted this is only in the front of the dining room, but they are there. So there. Before I knew what had hit me, David Vareille, the restaurant's sommelier had taken the stage at the head of our table and began regaling us with entertaining tales about the fermented grape juice he was bursting to tell us about. This guy is a treasure. He is outspoken, very knowledgeable and definitely beats to the tune of his own drum. There are some real gems within his cellar's booty, and we were lucky enough to taste a few of them, many of which won't set you back all that much. Another great feature of BB is that they feature a large bottle of the day, every day. David picks a magnum (or other large format bottle) that he thinks is interesting for whatever reason and then comes up with a very reasonable price per glass, so that customers can experience a wine they may not otherwise be able to try. For example, if he opened up a Mouton or a Lafite, you might be able to sample a glass for around \u00a345-55 (depending on the vintage), which although still ridiculously",
