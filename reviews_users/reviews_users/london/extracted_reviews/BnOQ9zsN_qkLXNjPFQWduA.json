    "text": "A busy Korean restaurant in Soho, I've been here a few times and although the food is authentic, it is not a regular haunt of mine. Although the staff is friendly, the menu is extensive and the food is fresh (or well-fermented, depending on what you order), and fairly good (save for a disappointing Yook Hwe, Asadal does a much better version) I've failed to really warm to this place. It could be the large windows I've been sat next to on every visit; I generally do not like it when people walking past can eyeball my plate, or it could be that the state of the loos grossed me out - IMHO if you have a restaurant where the plumbing is about to kick its clogs, you should waste no time getting it fixed. But for anyone who can look beyond such issues, you will be in for a fairly good meal and as Myungga can get busy in the evening, it is recommended that you either book a table or be prepared to wait.",

Initially they refused to remove the over-charge (which we proved we were correct about by consulting the menu), so we said we'd just not-pay the service charge (optional by law anyway). I can't stress enough how measured, sober and polite we are, this was not a 'lads night out' rowdy group by a long shot. But anyway, the manager exploded at this point (not literally unfortunately) and ran screaming and shouting to pick up the phone and dialled 999 to summon the police, actual police, blue lights, nee-naw, 'now then now then' POLICE. (They never turned up obviously as they have genuine police work to do and don't need time wasters like Myung Ga management stopping them from doing their work).Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",

    "text": "I've been to dozens of Korean restaurants around New York, London, San Francisco, and Seoul - and by far, this one is the worst.First, let's start with the attitude of the staff. My buddy and I walked into the restaurant on a Friday evening at 9:45pm, and the hostess immediately notified us that they were closing soon (which, we found out later was actually 11pm) and that we'd have to hurry up. We were promptly seated, given the menu, and asked if we knew what we wanted. We hadn't even seen the menu yet, so we asked for a few minutes. Finally, my friend ordered the Bulgogi and I the Kalbi. The waitress kindly brought over our meats and grilled it there. After a few minutes we realized that we literally had just ordered meat. Now, anyone who's ever been to almost any Korean restaurant anywhere in the world knows that normally, you order your meat, and you are given rice, broth, lettuce (for wrapping), as well as pickled vegetables, kimchee, and salted fish or fish skins. We received none of this. Not even water. Just meat. We asked the waiter if it came with anything, and he began yelling at us that we didn't order anything else, we just ordered the meat. Our hostess then came to join the waiter in making us look a fool saying, very curtly, \"Sir! You did not order anything else. If you want something else, why you don't order it then?\" I did not even know how to respond, so we quickly ate our meager portion of meat, paid our 30 quid (with 14.5% service charge included) and left, with the bitter taste of hunger, dissatisfaction, and the feeling of being thoroughly mistreated left in our mouths.",

Luck would have it i found this place wandering around, and now that I'm back in my hotel connected to the tripple w's, it happend to be this exact place! Anyway, not a great experience for me. As I walked in, i was greeted and seated, when the younger gentleman came and I placed my order, he didnt say a word and stared at me as if i owed him money.... then didnt say and word and took the menu and left... alright. I ordered a spicy fish jigae (8.80 GBP) and a beef bulgogi (7 GBP). The food was decent, but i guess i was too accustomed to eating korean in Vancouver and north america with loads of complimentary side dishes. You'll get non of that here, and i'm pretty sure they charged for the 2 bowls of rice. My bill came to 24 GBP, so i assume each bowl of rice was 3 GBP? I didnt even get a smile or thank you from the waitress with the bill. I guess that's what happens when they automatically include a 12% tip (the menu had 10% printed but crossed out and penned in 12% haha) in the bill. Who knows, maybe it was my damn sexy face that all the staff there were jealous and hated me entitling such horrible service. =P",

Not familiar with Korean food and always keen to try something new, we had an early dinner at Myung Ga. The first thing that impressed me was that the restaurant was filled with Koreans who spoke animatedly with staff in their language. I always see this as a good sign of the food's authenticity. My parents are both from the Caribbean and I would be slightly disappointed if I went to a West Indian restaurant and none of the diners were West Indian.The staff were attentive and took time to explain the dishes on the menu. We ordered Kimchi (Korea's national dish), there are many varieties but we went for the cabbage rolls with shrimp, ginger and various other seasoning. Myung Ga specialises in barbeque dishes and each table has its own barbeque in the centre where the waitress cooks your meat. We enjoyed the barbequed chicken with spicy noodles.With so many restaurant chains In the West End it is refreshing to discover an authentic restaurant with great food, reasonable prices and good service.\"",

At night the east end of Soho can get particular crowded and unpleasant. On \u00a0Kingly Street, a side street to Regent Street a Korean Restaurant is hidden away. The windows are dimmed and it is not over stylish decorated.We were in for treat that night discovering this Korean, which turned out to be an excellent choice. It was the first time I was introduced to Korean. This place is specialising in BBQ on your table and other dishes such as Kimchi, Bulgogi and Bibimbap. Korean is well known for its grill, which is placed in the middle of the table, where the beef is cooked in front of you. Lots of different sauces are served with it and instead of ordering a big main course we stuck to different starters and mains to share. The grilled meat was tenderer then anything I had before, as the slices were very slim but only cooked for a couple of minutes.If I can choose from my favourite Asian food I have to say Korean and Vietnamese! If you pass this place do not hesitate and go in!",

    "text": "Having been spoiled by Los Angeles Korean food (a tiny step down from Seoul, in my opinion) and a Korean grandmother, I recognize the high standards I set when searching for Korean food.I read the mixed reviews and hoped to be proven wrong by Myung Ga ... sadly, it lived up to its mediocrity. The pan chan was flavorless and lacked freshness (particularly the kimchi). The kalbi was disappointing ... very thin but equally flavorless. Even the sam jan was a miss ... I found myself adding salt to nearly everything just for some flavor.The service was fine .. though I never expect much from Korean service. Food was prompt to arrive despite being a fairly busy Sunday evening.I doubt I will return as it really was a letdown ... if you are searching for great Korean food in London, I recommend Kaya (Mayfair). The food is excellent and they only use fresh, top quality ingredients. Though a bit more expensive, I assure you it is worth it",

A large pot of cold sake made it all the more appetising - this is a good combination for anyone trying out the place for the first time. Our main course consisted of thin slices of tasty marinated meat: pork, chicken, and beef - all cooked by the waiting staff on the hot plate built into the middle of our table. Lots of fun and a very enjoyable evening.",

    "text": "We didn't make a reservation, but we were willing to wait for 45 min to get a table for three. After 45 min we were still waiting so we asked when the table will be free since we saw several table weres free. Apparently they forgot about us and asked us to wait for another while. After 10 min more we finally got seated. No sweat we thought, we could finally order our dishes. The seafood pancake was a bit off than the usual ones, but it still tasted good, only we couldn't find any seafood in it despite it was supposed to a seafood pancake. I kept wondering whether they didn't make a mistake. Since another dish wasn't also wrong. We ordered thinly sliced beef for the BBQ, but instead we received the thick beef slices.But we didn't want to ruin our dinner so we kept quite about it and decided just to enjoy our meal. The other meats for the BBQ have also arrived so the waiter started to BBQ these for us. We have already noticed from the previous sliced beef that just a split second they would turn the meat over, since it was only beef than it was still okay. But the other meats as pork and chicken they would do the same. Even though everyone knows that these have to be well done. After seeing that these meat are not well done. The chicken was still raw and the pork was still bloody. We turned on the heater again to grill them a bit longer. Not a minute longer, even though seeing us grilling them again, the waiter came back and turn off the heater again.It was like they couldn't care less that the meat weren't well done, whether it was pork of chicken. It felt like they were rushing us to finish all the dishes as we set down, because more people came in to wait for a table.Overall the service was very poor and the service fee was standard in the charging bill. The prices are also higher compared to other Korean restaurants.Disappointing was also the absence of small dishes which were usually provided at the beginning, like little bowl of kimchi, sour cucumber, etc.Even though the restaurant survived since 1990, it would properly be, because it was better located than the other Korean restaurants. If you really want to eat good Korean food, you can do much better at Arang (9 Golden Square, not much further away than Myung Ga) and the prices are much more faire.And if you want to eat just Bibimbap then you can go to Bi Bim Bap (Soho) at Greek street.",

We were starving so we decided to go to the only place we could find that didn't have a wait, which was Myung Ga (usually a bad idea if a place is the only one without a wait in a busy area like soho on a Saturday night).If you have ever tried real Korean food in the US, especially LA, stay away from here!! The Korean BBQ does not taste like any type of Korean BBQ I've ever had, and I don't mean that in the good way. We also had a dolsot bibimbap, japchae and soondubu, all of which were subpar. The servers were not very friendly, and the \"discretionary\" tip charge was included in our bill, so not actually discretionary. All the sides are charged separately per dish, and it's soho so prices are going to be steep. Overall, I would not recommend this place if you've already had good Korean food elsewhere before.",

The squid was good. I think this restaurant makes vegetables better than meat.For meat, we ordered: Bulgogi (I thought it could have been marinated more), Hue gui (ox tongue in lemon juice, which I did not touch lol), and Jumul luk.And then we got three Dolsol Bibimbap. I got mine with beef and NO korean spice sauce. This was my favorite.My friends weren't satisfed with the food here, but was satisfed by the cute Korean-Chinese waiter named An.",

With a good arrangements of tables and not feeling to close to the table next door.I had the beef dumpling soup which was really nice, and kind of made me expect something good of the Ganjang beef dish i ordered. However that was kind of a let down, the beef was overcooked and the sauce lacked the spiciness that I was expecting. I guess it will be a tough deal trying to find a Korean joint that meets the high standards I am used to so fingers crossed, there are loads more choices in London.",

    "text": "I am quite disappointed to find that the most of reviews about this place, Myung ga (, meaning, a popular venue) are posted by others who have not acquird the expert taste in Korean Cuisine yet. \u00a0And, their food or the service \u00a0don't live up to their name.Although it is conveniently located, I would advise you to pass this place \u00a0if your priority is the genuine Korean taste, but if you are into the restaurant-style dining, this would fit your bill as a beginner. I advise you to try other places in Soho area, if you don't mind walking further to the East.I have had Korean foods in Korea, USA, all over Europe, and London, or New Malden in UK. But, this place is not really for the Korean foodies. I would say they add sugar and other artificial flavoring in most of their foods. Although I address the questionable taste to the owner, she flatly refused to listen, insisting that it is her mother's recipe, although she admit putting such stuff. Although I reminded her that we are talking about the restaurant business where the genuine flavor is the top priority. She disagreed. Furthermore, she commented that even the commercial marinate sauce jars one could find in an oriental grocery store has sugars and other stuff and why not in their kitchen, she asked back. I ask you to be the judge, if you could say 5 stars in the candied meat-serving restaurant and if the ingredients are revealed for a candid judgment. I cannot give any number but zero.The waiting was also rushed, \u00a0amateurish, the table was not attended by one, but more than 3-4 servers at random, there was no attention but rushing to remove each plate away. That appeared vulgar. And, when I asked one server not to remove the plates as one of us is still eating, and, he removed the plate anyway, only to upset us more. When I mentioned the poor service, the waiter followed me to listen to my complaint to the boss at the counter. And the boss would not let him go away either. I can tell you this. Among Koreans, this is not the favorite place by Koreans really, in London, and you can tell from the clients sitting in the room that it was for other Asian tourists and young couples. I heard Singaporeans next to our table majorly complain about their food experience then. I felt we were being \"duped.\" and \"humiliating\" would be the next word.The price is high for the quality and the quantity is almost half of what you expect. So, although it appeared $$ priced, you will end up spending 50% more money than you would expect to spend in any other Korean restaurant in W1 area.I would suggest you walk up toward toward Tottenham Court Road or Charing Cross road area to find a far better Korean restaurant than this, if you don't mind the humble setting. Or, simply try Bibigo a few blocks away for a nicer restaurant setting.This place really upset me and my partner. The worst was, our constructive complaint and suggestion was flatly dismissed by the boss lady. Good luck to them and thanks for making our dinner experience quite humiliating and unforgivable.",

    "text": "Go to Assa...With the amount of choice these days of Asian restaurants, there are so many better places to go then Myung Ga. I'd go as far as to say to avoid this place, it was one of the worst experiences I've had at a London restaurant.First of all the staff. Rude and slow from the get go. There was no 'welcome' or 'hello', just a little bit of a grunt and we were led to our table (after a 15 minute wait)... The menus were plopped in front of us and after that we're paid no attention. Several times we asked for our order to be taken, but the waiters either ignored us completely or were about to take our order and then mid-sentence walk off to say hi to a friend. Ridiculous. On top of that once we had finished the first dishes we ordered, our barbecue was closed as if they wanted us to leave. We were ready to order more as the dishes are small but then decided against giving the place any more money. They really didn't deserve it.The food is also mediocre. While the taste is ok, everything is heavily overpriced for the size and quality of the dishes. You have to pay \u00a32.90 for lettuce to go alongside your BBQ, something which should be a natural part of the dish. We ordered two appetizers, a sharing platter of meat, ribs (which they forgot about) and a bowl of rice, and were left quite hungry at the end.Once we finally got the bill ordered we told the manager we wouldn't pay service charge (a massive 12.5% for such a place) he literally laughed at us and looked at us like we were idiots. After some arguing back and forth we didn't pay for it, but with a \"warning\" that next time he would make us pay. Like there will ever be a next time...Honestly, go somewhere else.",
