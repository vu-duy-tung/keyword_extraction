    "text": "I find myself a little shocked to award the place only 3 stars but the cost of the dinner bore no relation to the quality of the dining when we went there. Agreed, the ambience is great, the service is good (though they stopped me taking any photos), and there is no question about the great quality of the ingredients. The problem is, it didn't work out on the night. We went for the full menu and found that a couple of dishes had way too much salt applied. A little too much drama was injected into serving the (somewhat uninspired) sauces on a couple of the dishes. As a result, I would be hard-pushed to say that this place delivers better value or provides better dining than several other establishments in London for the \u00a3350 spent for 2. Maybe, ultimately, it can also be my high expectations of the place and perhaps I would try the restaurant again another night to have another opinion. If it does improve, I will amend this review for sure.",

Unfortunately, the experience was nowhere near the first.Again we went for the tasting menu. This time coupled with the sommeliers pairings of wine. BIG mistake. The sommelier was the worst sommelier we have ever had the unfortunate luck to depend on! In fact we had to ask for substitutions to his choice quite a few times. Terrible.His attitude also left alot to be desired.Two of the dishes we were served were literally inedible! They were substituted for better options. Still this is not what i expected considering my wonderful first experience.We were taken into the kitchen ( as all diners are). However, we were not offered the lovely chocolate truffles on our way out. ( we put that down to our bluntness about our experience!).For the ridiculous prices here, this experience shattered the illusion. I will not be wasting another penny here. Very unfortunate.",

The service here is intense. Once during dinner my friend got up to use the restroom and while she was gone they took away her dirty silverware and replaced it with new ones. And every time one of us left the table they wouldn't just fold our napkins, they would bring out a fresh one!Got there early so had drinks at The Blue Bar first: I forgot the name, but it was basically a lychee martiniAmuse Bouche - mushroom soup in a shot glass. Best mushroom soup I've ever had. I could have pounded down 10 of those.Lobster with squash - It was good, nothing amazingly special about it.Foie Gras with prunes and walnuts - Great variation, especially if you are new to it and need to be weened onto that foie gras taste. Personally I thought the walnut overpowered it and wasn't able to taste the foie gras.Crab with Heirloom tomatoes, some razor clams, and crunchy potato bread in an herb sauce - RefreshingQuail with corn and onion rings - The onion rings were the best and the quail wasn't bad either.Seabass with 7 textures of cauliflower - It was interesting to see different ways cauliflower could be prepared. The skin on the seabass was perfectly crisp.Suckling pig with barbecue and ranch dressing - Best dish of the night! I was so full (like food baby twins) by the time this came out and I still finished it.Cheese - biggest portion of cheeses I've ever been offered.Pre dessert - couldn't understand what it was when they brought it out and couldn't figure it out by taste. It was okay.Basil parfait, lemon caramel, sherbet - such a different taste! It was a nice change from the super sweet deserts I've been eating.Out of all the tasting menu's I've done, this place has the largest portions. Everything was good, but there were only a few items that I really enjoyed here. anitaeat.com",

The food was tasty, sure, but nothing spectacular. \u00a0The egg custard tart for which Marcus Wareing is famous for was quite good, and one of our appetizers was particularly tasty, but other than that, the food did not stand out at all, especially for the price and the fact that the restaurant has two Michelin stars. \u00a0I did like the concept of the bon bon trolley, which was fun, but nothing compared to the dessert carts at Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon.It may be that we were there for the lunch menu, which might be less quality, or it may just be that my expectations were too high, but all in all the restaurant was overly pretentious and overly expensive for good but not phenomenal food. \u00a0If you want a better priced, more down-to-earth, friendlier, and tastier Michelin 2 star meal in London (with a great lunch menu to boot), check out The Capital.",

Perhaps Ramsay was a good influence on his partner, given that he often champions locally-sourced, good honest food... Whereas Wareing left to his own devices offers frappery and fussiness. To be fair, there were two very good courses on the tasting menu - the Quail and the beef. But the foie gras was smothered in sickly sweet cherry sauce (nauseating) and the dorset crab was interrupted by fishy mackerel (repulsive). Even worse, I had the premium fine wine pairings which were truly awful. The finest of the lot was a Lynch-Bages - nothing to sniff at to be sure - but a 2001, which was barely out of diapers. There was a decent Montrachet at one point, which was very welcome, but the goodwill was expended on a mediocre Cote de Rotie, a pedestrian Austrian White, a so-so Lugano White, a nasty New Zealander and a very strange Greek cough syrup that - when paired with the cherry foie GRAS - made everything taste maraschino. At 220 pounds a head I expected more. Sadly, I will not be returning. Because of the dishes that I did like I will give two stars but choose your own wine and be prepared for some posturing",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full article, please see: wp.me/pwXBH-19r \u00a0PETRUSALVATION Summary:I was pleasantly surprised by the generally wonderful food I ate during a recent lunch at Marcus Wareing's plush premises, which still retain the refrain of red Bordeaux from their previous proprietor's rein. Nearly every dish was unabashedly redolent with robust & clearly delineated flavors that sang on the palate, while service was professional & well-meaning. Sure, the backdrop may be a bit dated & smack of economic excesses; and yes, the clientele seems to fit a particular stereotype, but the food certainly makes the attractively priced prix-fixe lunch tempting. And once you've had that, you might be tempted to explore further should your purse strings be flexible enough to cope. It's not the most exciting or trendy restaurant in London right now, but the cooking certainly sets the bar high. Curing my curiosity I had been in London for a week, mostly for what turned out to be an exceedingly stressful and long week of work. However, after visiting Mrs. LF's family in France on our second weekend in Europe, and returning to London with two days off before heading back to the US, I was looking forward to some relaxation, and hopefully a good mealor two. The day after our arrival the weekend prior, we had the good fortune to dine at the chef's table of Heston Blumenthal's new restaurant, and his first in London. I hope to post about that meal next, as we had a great time \u00a0Baby LF included \u00a0and generally enjoyed the food. My only other fancy meal for the trip was originally supposed to be at Pied \u00e0 Terre, the dual Michelin star stalwart on Charlotte Street, at which I enjoyed a meal with my parents a number of years ago. However, with news that its head chef Shane Osbourne was to be departing rather soon, my dining colleague and I decided it might be more fun to try somewhere else. In fact, in planning my London trip, I had originally thought about trying the seemingly good value prix-fixe lunch menu at Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, despite the fact that I have never been a great fan of the current name adorning the restaurant's masthead. Having never met the man in person or tasted his food, 'who am I to judge anyway' is a fair enough question. I guess I have just never liked the way he comes off on camera, or in press comments/interviews, or through accounts of him from people I know. However, I was informed by my partner in crime that the kitchen's current sous-chef was definitely a talent (formerly holding the same position at Noma in Copenhagen) and, as I had always wanted to see what all the fuss was about anyway, it seemed like a grand idea \u00a0or at least a grand setting. If you enter the hotel from Wilton Place, just off Knightsbridge, you head straight to your right, through an open and pleasant informal dining space. Once through this area, two doors stand before you, they are opened (of course you would not open them yourself at a 5-star hotel), and you enter a fairly intimate rectangular dining room. As I was the first one to arrive, I was seated on a cushioned bench at one of the three squat tables that serve as the waiting area, and I must admit I felt rather awkward on my own seated next to two smartly dressed older couples who were enjoying aperitifs and some nibbles before taking their proper seats. After fiddling with my phone for a bit, I was about to order some Champagne as this seemed to be what one should do (and I never say no to some good Champagne), but my partner in crime arrived just in time to prevent a minor fleecing of funds from my wallet. As you would expect, the dining room tables were traditionally and faultlessly appointed, with perfectly ironed linen, fancy napery and so on and so forth. As many UK readers will know, this restaurant was formerly called Petrus, and was run by Gordon Ramsay Holdings before Marcus and Gordon went their separate ways in not such an amicable fashion. Ramsay recently, and rather ridiculously if you ask me, opened a new restaurant of the same name not that far away from the original one. Old habbits, and aging egos, die hard it would seem. In any case, the dining room that David Collins designed in 2003 for the original Petrus remains largely the same so far as I could tell, with rich claret being the color of concentration. The metal gridding adorning the windows is reminiscent of a wine rack, reinforcing the theme. Tables are very well spaced, and parties of two are seated at four and eight o'clock. It is a formal room and most of the guests on the day we dined were probably over 50 and all very well turned out. I wondered if the food would be as traditional as the setting. Tour de flavor We were presented with a number of menu options, but in the end decided to go with the prix-fixe menu, which gives you two options for starters and mains and three choices for desserts, plus the amuse bouche(s), pre-dessert and petit fours that you expect at a",

As we arrived, the waiters took our coats and showed us to our table, before bringing round a champagne trolley (without wanting to seem stingy, I asked for a wine list, not wanting to spend my entire month's wage on one glass of alcohol.) We had opted for the lunch menu, which was around \u00a345 each - still expensive, but definitely the cheap option in this restaurant, where I could see groups of businessment swilling champagne like lemonade!What I loved about Petrus was that the waiters weren't snooty and didn't make us feel out of place even though we were obviously not accustomed to that type of dining. Instead, they seemed really pleased that we'd visited, and tried their best to make it a lovely afternoon. The food was, of course, absolutely amazing. With the lunch menu, you choose your starter, main and pudding, and they also bring you little dishes in between - for example, freshly baked bread to begin with and, later, a trolley of chocolate truffles from which we could each choose 3. The courses we chose were delicious (my favourite dish being the poussin) but it was these extra touches which made it really special. Whilst eating, we noticed groups of people being led into the kitchens, so when we finished, my friend asked if there was any chance we could look round. The head waiter was delighted to give us a tour of the kitchens and introduce the chef which really made our afternoon. This is not just a meal - it's an experience!",

    "text": "What can anyone say about this place that hasn't already been said? Gerry and I went here on Thursday night for her Birthday, and it was everything you would expect it to be. We went for the 8-course 'Tasting Menu', which started with an astonishing Jerusalem Artichoke soup and then took us through Foie Gras, Turbot with Liquorice, Saddle of Venison and many more. The food was just beautiful, however the most amazing thing about the restaurant wasn't the food - it was the service! It seemed that there were individual waiters not for each table, but for each activity - so one waiter would remove our plates, another our glasses, a third would bring the fresh wine glasses, the sommelier bring the next glass of wine, then a runner would appear with your dish on a tray, and he would wait for the Head Waiter, who would then place your plate in front of you with a theatrical flourish. It made for great entertainment. One word of warning - normally when you have a tasting menu, there are 'matched wines' and you get a small amount of the Sommelier's recommended wine with each course. While this isn't something that is specifically offered at Petrus, they will happily match wines for you - however they give a full, large glass of each wine with each course, which meant that by dessert our tastebuds were more than a little blunted by the quantity of alcohol! As we were Petrus virgins, we were thoughtfully given a copy of the Menu, signed by Marcus Wareing himself, which is a lovely touch and will no doubt bring back memories in the future. All told, then, an absolutely stunning meal and experience - but equally stunning was the final bill, which came to a heart-stopping (if not sobering) \u00a3396 including service! My bank account will be feeling dinner at Petrus long after my stomach has forgotten it So - a beautiful place, wonderful food, fantastic service.

The service was also exceptional. Formal but not stuffy. Attentive but not overbearing. The wine recommendations are also spot on. Definitely very recommended.",

Excellent wines and you can find an affordable one.Inventive food, beautifully cooked & presented.Staggered out to a room full of people enjoying a champagne high tea...should have had a walk round the block and gone back!Will go again soon.",

    "text": "We had been meaning to try Marcus Wareing for a while and finally ticked it off just before Christmas. It was a very polished experience, the food was immaculate, and the setting was smart - it was probably the definition of 'fine dining'. That said, despite it being faultless, I didn't walk away thinking 'wow' as I have at some other places. Whilst the quality of the food was amazing, I didn't find that the personality of the chef shone through and it meant that the menu was a bit boring; and despite the quality of the interior, I felt it was a bit cold for my tastes and could do with a bit of modernising. Both of these things could be said to be personal tastes so if you're just after exceptional quality food then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place. However if you want something a bit more modern and interesting then maybe try somewhere else first.We had the tasting menu which consisted of: mackerel, foie gras, mushroom & teal (second best), scallop, lamb (best), stilton, apple & chestnut, lemon (3rd best). It all came to 380 including wine, coffees and service.Update - they must have listened to my feedback because they're closing to refurbish and reopen as the more modern and accessible Marcus.",

The decor and ambiance of the dining room is warm, welcoming but not intimidating.We had the 'Taste of Summer' fixed menu, the canap\u00e9 of baked cheese was excellent; the amuse bouche was a soft poached hens egg with broccoli spears in a creamy white truffle sauce. The egg was tepid/cold which really took away from the dish.The sea bream fish course was excellent, perfectly cooked and great flavor. My main (lamb neck) was slightly cold and had a rubbery texture, the beans and pea pur\u00e9e were amazing! I could have had those without the lamb to be honest.The cheese plate was a single hard cheese, I would have liked a smaller portion of a couple of cheeses.The desert was a frozen cream and freeze dried berry dish, too much frozen/dry, would have preferred a more fresh fruit infusion with the frozen cream.Overall I enjoyed the meal but at that price I would have expected a little more on the food front, especially considering the 2 star rating.",

We had some canap\u00e9s to start, then a very extensive wine list to follow. From \u00a350 to \u00a35,900 a bottle, it was impressive. The menu options are either a huge tasting menu for \u00a3120, or 3 courses at \u00a385 / 4 at \u00a3105. We were given some really crusty, home made bread to start while we chose our wine. With a little help from the very skilled Sommelier, we chose a nice Cabernet. I had the wood pigeon, which was blue.. I hadn't had it like that before, but I wouldn't have it any other way again. It was lovely.Marcus' menu is full of baby animals. I loved it. I had suckling pig, which came with belly, chops and the tenderloin. My date had the milk fed lamb. She doesn't eat loads, so I tucked away most of that as well. It was very salty, but most high class restaurants I've been to have been the same. Maybe it's a posh person thing. Anyway, long story short, this meal was to congratulate me on a new job, which I ended up not starting. This came up in conversation with one of the servers, and before I knew it, I was bought out a little moussey/cake with a candle on and 'congratulations' written in the most beautiful chocolate writing. It was that personal touch that you just wouldn't get in most other places. I was honoured. I was so stuffed after all this, we did have pudding bought over after this as we'd gone for the three courses. I'm not even going to describe the puds for you, it was so good I want to keep that one to myself. The Berkeley is a great place to stay and eat, and is a real treat if you're looking for a special time to remember. I definitely got my leg over way more than I deserved that night. Cheers.",

The one small negative is at the restaurant has no affiliation with the hotel's Blue Bar so drinks cannot be ordered from the bar menu and the cocktails on offer at the restaurant are fairly limited.",

Perhaps we had set expectations that were too high, but we were left quite underwhelmed at the end of the experience. The starters were a great way to kick off our 4 course meal. My wife went for the scallop whilst I had the wood pigeon -- both delicious. Things unfortunately didn't continue at that level for us. The temperature on our middle course of fish wasn't great and we were left with rather cold fish. The mains didn't set themselves apart in any way and were average at best. Dessert was fairly average to continue the theme. I am a massive fan of the restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one is quite low on my list of ones to re-visit.",

It is fun to watch other diners making their selections although not as much as making your choices yourself.The only negative for me is the price - it is very expensive to eat off either the a la carte or the tasting menu. \u00a0The lunch menu is a good value alternative but does not have the same razzle-dazzle as the real deal.",

    "text": "After the very public parting of ways between Gordon Ramsay and his protege Marcus Wareing last year, Marcus Wareing kept the space of the old Petrus restaurant at The Berkeley Hotel while Ramsay kept the Petrus name and will be reopening it at another venue.Since then, Marcus Wareing has been working hard to put his stamp on the new restaurant that bears his name and all his hard work has led to him retaining his 2 Michelin stars in this year's guide, an honour he held for many years with Petrus.The dining room retains its dark colour scheme with a whole wall dominated by an impressive wine cellar. The service remains efficient and faultless though it was nice to see a smile and acknowledgement from the front of house team when we made a quip or gave a word of praise or had a question.I can sense a change in the menu since Marcus Wareing took over running of the kitchen completely with a little more daring and slight light-heartedness coming through the dishes. However, the word to encapsulate the experience of dining here is precision. The dishes and courses are executed and presented perfectly. In fact, it's the only restaurant I've been to where they serve you replacement napkins with a spoon and fork, like silver service.My sister and I opted for the tasting menu and were pleasantly surprised to find out that we could substitute dishes from the a la carte menu for any of the courses. A very generous and welcome idea.1. 3 pre-amuse canapes. A light mousse with crouton-like small bits of brioche. A fantastic triangle of foie gras with crispy shell. Yummy mini meatball, which was light but deliciously seasoned and savoury.2. Amuse bouche of what looked like a tall shot glass of coffee with espresso-like foam. It turned out to be warm tomato soup topped with basil foam. Brought a smile to my face and reflecting a little more playfulness in the food. Lovely flavour but perhaps the soup could have been served just a couple of degrees cooler as the heat initially stopped me tasting the fully wonder of the tomato flavour.3. Generous slab of seared foie gras, rhubarb and candied hazelnuts. The foie gras was cooked to perfection - unctuously rich on the inside with a crispy seared shell. Nicely offset by the accompaniments.4. Sweet large Scottish scallop with roasted coral with a sauce poured at the table. It's so nice to see posh restaurants serve coral as I adore its wonderful deep flavour.5. Tender moist roasted quail served with cabbage \u00a0and baked potato foam. Nice depth of flavour came through with this dish.6. Sis and I substituted turbot for monkfish as recommended by our waiter, which was a great move. It's hard to find turbot as a home cook and the fish had a lovely robust flavour, ably enhanced by a chanterelle mushroom sauce.7. I substituted one of my favourite dishes for main course - 24 hour cooked suckling pig. The dish was served up with 3 cuts - loin, rib and pork belly, all delicious with the sweet flavour of high quality pork. Of course suckling pig wouldn't be complete without crunchy crackling and this version didn't disappoint with a strip of top class crackling. The dish was garnished with braised chicory, meat jus and a small pot of light pommes mouselline. My sis pronounced herself very pleased with her pigeon.8. Pre-dessert of small slab of light chocolate cake and a small glassful of passionfruit gelee topped with lychee and vodka ice.9. We shared and exchanged our desserts. One was a warm chocolate moelleux, banana jelly and ice cream and the other was an orange creme, spiced brioche crisps and chocolate sorbet. Not a smidgen was left of either dish.10. Lovely selection of chocolate truffles. Our favourite was probably one with a crunchy outside with peanut butter interior and white chocolate outside with blueberry filling.What made the visit extra special was the tour of the kitchen, which was offered when I asked whether chef was in that evening. It was a most comprehensive tour with Louise taking time to explain all the different stations and the processes happening at each station. The highlight was to be able to have a few words with the great man himself, who was very generous in taking a little time for a very quick chat despite working very hard at the pass in the middle of a busy service. It was the highlight of a very enjoyable meal at this restaurant.I wish Marcus Wareing every success and hope that his passion and food will eventually win him that coveted third Michelin star. If and when he does achieve that, this diner will send a cheer and raise a glass to him and say,\"Well deserved!\"",

    "text": "Agree somewhat with bbd's comments on this. I have no issue with spending \u00a3350 on a meal for two, but it has to be top-notch for that price. This will pain Marcus Wareing to hear, given his falling-out with Gordon Ramsay, but his restaurant doesn't quite match up to Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's (GRaC). It's not that Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley is bad; it just isn't perfect. To put into the proper perspective that a 5-star system can't offer, if Claridge's is 100%, The Berkeley is 98%. The extra 2%? Well, first off, the food: at GRaC, I've had several 'that's the best x I've ever had moments'; nothing came close here. At GRaC, the combination of ingredients in every dish was perfectly balanced, and came together very much as a whole dish. With a couple of dishes here, the combination sounded great on paper but didn't quite form a cohesive dish. Presentation was also ever-so-slightly sloppy with a couple of sauces smearing the edge of the plate. Secondly, the service was just the wrong side of formal for me. Efficient and mostly impeccable (aside from the 30 minute wait at the end for our bill), it just lacked warmth. Whereas at GRaC, the staff discreetly found out we were there for our anniversary and then laid on a couple of special treats for us, there was no such extra special service here at Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. If I'd never been to Claridge's before coming here, it's probable I'd have given a 5-star review. Unfortunately for Marcus Wareing, his old mentor's restaurant at Claridge's sets a standard that he fails to meet here.",

    "text": "Oh my God! I had lunch there with my gay husband today and I didn't want it to end. His fantastic company of course was the main attraction but our lunch was one that can only be dreamed about. This has got to go down as the best way to spend a Bank Holiday Monday ever! When we were seated, we were given a snack of Foie Gras with mini crostini type things and houmous. It was smooth and clean. Then came the Amuse Bouche, it was a sweetcorn soup in a shotglass served with some caraway seeded breadsticks. To follow we had more bread and then as a starter I had quail ravioli. This came with a reduced potato soup - very intense flavours but they all balanced out. It was just the right size too. Everything was well rounded in taste and texture. For my main I had some seabass which came with dauphinois pureed potato. Genius. The potatoes had the texture of velvet and the seasonings complimented the bass perfectly. We then had some cheese from the trolley and as a pre-dessert a little glass filled with passion fruit jelly, lemon cream and a lychee and vodka sorbet. This was the best take on jelly and ice cream I have ever experienced. Then for dessert I had the baked custard tart. I felt it would be rude not to, especially given that Marcus made something similar as a dessert for the Queen's 80th Birthday celebration. I figured that if it was good enough for her then another queen like myself might enjoy it too, and boy did I like it. The base was made out of gingerbread, then there was sort creamy baked custard and a little quinelle of strawberry mivvi ice cream and little strawberry jelly squares topped with basil. We then had some of the homemade truffles and they were amazing. The salted caramel was my personal favorite. The best thing about this lunch menu was the price. It wasn't cheap but we had amazing food. Also the extras made it feel as if we were getting better value for money. The portions of food were spot on too. They didn't leave us feeling bloated or like we had become impregnated with a food baby. When we left we walked through Green Park which proved a useful pit stop for walking off a lovely dinner. Marcus doesn't come cheap but it is so worth getting your house remortgaged for. In these times of the credit crunch comes a place full of decadent distraction.",

I ordered the tasting menu but actually the best item that came was the palate cleanser in between courses, which was some sort of honey yoghurt concoction. I wish I knew what was in it. My entire table considered it the highlight of the meal, which is a bit sad for the rest of the menu.My burrata appetiser with kale, confit lemon and caramelised shallot was alright and my main of roasted cod with laverbread Welsh seaweed, oat, and Monk's beard vegetable was ok as well, but neither was particularly good. My husband had the partridge, sweetcorn and turmeric appetiser and the venison haunch, with parsnip, pickled grape and sorrel, which were better, although nothing memorable. My dessert of 70% chocolate with raspberry and buttermilk, I did not even like and I am a chocoholic. I think the emphasis at this restaurant is on artistic presentation rather than actual taste, but for me if it doesn't taste good, it doesn't matter how pretty it looks. The amuse bouches they served us were also not very good, I think one was a rather unpleasant popcorn soup and although the marshmallow dessert they gave us was beautiful, it was not really worth eating. The restaurant itself is quite glamorous and the atmosphere does make for a lovely evening. Even though I did not like my food at all, I did at least enjoy being there. I would not recommend this place though. I have been to other restaurants which may not have earned a Michelin star, but have certainly earned my heart with their culinary offerings, and this one simply did not.",

The food beautiful to look at, which you would expect as a Michelin two star winner. I had scallops with a beef gel- I thought this was really weird combination..couldn't taste the scallops at all only beef. For the main I had the turbot which had a heavy creamy sauce and was over salted, plus one of the fillets was not cooked through...kinda shocked by that one. Dessert was great with cherry Marsala and almond cake. My husband had the short ribs as an appetizer and lamb- he loved both.",

I guess expectations were high given my great experience with other similarly ranked Michelin restaurants and what London has to offer in terms of restaurants. \u00a0As I try writing down what I enjoyed the most a few days after, I am blanking out which maybe highlights what my experience here was. \u00a0It was ok. I knew I had a good meal but it wasnt that memorable. \u00a0When I looked at my pictures, I did remember that the tandoori flavored ribs was actually interesting. \u00a0It was a clever dish that highlighted the flavors if the spice and was pretty tender. \u00a0 There was a dish that had truffles but I felt it was more of a show because the truffle didn't really add anything for me to that specific flavor palate. \u00a0The dish was fine even without it and it really didn't elevate it or needed it.",

Have long been a fan of Marcus Wareing and seeing him on the TV enhanced our decision to visit his restaurant. The restaurant itself is set in a fantastic location that is the Berkeley Hotel so you get warm & very friendly greeting on arrival you are then escorted through to the restaurant which at first glimpse is stunning and as you looked around all the tables were nicely situated. We were sat in this delightful little booth that form the outer part of the restaurant. You are then greeted by the head of Front of House and his manner really does set the tone for all members of staff who were all warm , friendly & very professional providing excellent service throughout the evening. Well I better move onto the food which was as fantastic as I thought it would be a truly outstanding 8 Course Tasting Menu that started with a stunning Mackerel dish and definitely the best I've ever tasted to be followed by the Orkney Scallop with a Roast Beef dressing. The next course was also amazing Sharpe's Express 1900 potatoes with girolles , Tunworth Cheese & Truffle just magical our next course was a fabulous Octopus served with a Beef Tea to be followed by the Short Rib with Vindaloo Spices. So now we reach the Main Course and yes it was the highlight Herdwick Lamb , hispi cabbage & mustard simply stunning. Now on to desserts which started with a light Smoked Milk & Mandarin to be followed by a absolutely exquisite Toffee , Peanut , Milk Chocolate & Nougat literally heaven on a plate . A word now for the Sommelier who was very charming and certainly produced some amazing wine that matched each course perfectly and with a fantastic brandy to finish . This ended a stunning & memorable evening to which I will definitely look forward to experiencing again",

Marcus Wareing, the man looks like he knows what he's talking about.Fun fact, Gordon Ramsay used to be a co-owner of this restaurant (under the name Petrus). It's located in the elegant yet trendy Berkeley hotel, not far from the Knightsbridge station but most other guests seem to prefer arriving in Aston Martins.I opted for the tasting menu, and it was very well prepared. I'm sure other yelpers have written more details about each dish here, plus the menu changes constantly, so I won't review every course.The reason it's 4 star not 5 is because of two things:- The lighting: it was REALLY dark! Yes I know fine dining places are normally very dim but this was still a bit unexpected. It makes the atmosphere not as lively as it could be.- Time between dishes: There was a long pause between the appetizers and main dishes that made us wonder if anything went wrong in the kitchen. Not sure if it was a one time thing or it typically took this long. Other than that we had a great meal.",

You'll notice a bar in the right and you pretty much have to walk through that to get to the shaded glass door which is the entrance to the Marcus Wareing. If you're not sure, just ask one of the employees there, and they will gladly walk you to the restaurant.The ambiance is nice and intimate. Even with big groups that were eating by me, it wasn't at all loud or anything. No great views from the windows, but who cares since you're about to enjoy some very nice fine dining here.Service was impeccable here. There were no fewer than 5 or 6 people throughout the evening handing me plates of food with a British-French accent. \u00a0The maitre'd even gave me a tour of the kitchen. Now that was the highlight of my evening. I also loved the cheese cart too. They get their cheeses from La Fromagerie and there were at least 30 or so unpasterized cheeses to choose from. Too bad I can't bring these unpasterized cheeses to the states because the cheeses stood out during my visit here.Michelin 2 stars in 2012",

He didn't do a great job recommending wines for us. He just pointed to a bunch of wines seemingly randomly. I kept asking for something with cabernet franc, and he pointed to wine after wine with no cabernet franc. Peculiar. Otherwise though, everyone else was amazing. The highlight though was when our head waiter went way over the top for us. After ordering, my wife changed her mind, and wanted to change one of her courses from the scallops to the pigeon. The waiter said he'd just bring her both, so she could try both. Meanwhile, when my wife ordered a dessert, and I didn't, he brought me my own dessert anyway. Amazing!Both my wife and I both basically got 5 courses for the price of 4. The only reason why I didn't give Marcus 5 stars, is because it's a 2-Michelin restaurant, and while the food was really good, it didn't stand out any more than many of the 1-Michelin star restaurants I've been too. So, on the food front, it disappointed just a little. My wife and I each ordered the 4-course a la carte. Here's what we ate:1) Amuse bouche 1: tomato, polenta, and black olive2) Amuse bouche 2: buttered shrimp cracker 3) Potato fennel bread. I LOVED this bread. It was so savory with the fennel4) Scallops - delicious! My wife said these were the best scallops she's ever had5) Halibut - the puree was a bit bitter, but the fish was poached perfectly. Super tender 6) Pigeon - really good. Not gamy at all. The fried crispy pork was amazing. The aroma lingered in my nose long after the last bite7) Turbot and short rib - good, but not amazing. The turbot fish had a clean taste but nothing to write home about8) Cod9) Suckling pig - the skin was amazingly crispy. But after this dish, I had reached my daily quota of fat intake10) Duck - the hazelnut crust and pickled radish were amazing. The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare11) Lemon meringue with an ice tea sorbet - tasted almost like a decadent creme brulee12) Warm chocolate fondant13) Coconut bite14) Orange chocolate biteFinal dessertWine: Australian cabernet. Yum!",

It may not appeal to a more fussy eater, but I'm not really sure that this is the sort of place to go if you are fussy.We had the tasting menu, which was superb, a real journey especially when taken with the tasting wine selection. Waiting staff were also superb, service level was excellent with constant attention throughout the evening.",
