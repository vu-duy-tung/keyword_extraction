It has a very earthy feel to it also, with plants hanging all over the ceiling. HOWEVER, be prepared to wait during peak hours. I went at 3pm once--it was half full. 7pm--COMPLETELY PACKED. I asked how long it would be before I would get a table for two: 3 hours. There are two separate parts of the pub though. One for drinks and one for sitting down and eating. (Although you can eat at the bar also.) It just depends on what you're looking for. I guess while you're waiting you can go have a couple of drinks? Go for the food though! The pad thai and drunken noodle we had were both delish. (:",

So just keep that in mind when you plan your visit, OK!",

It was so cold we nearly gave up but suddenly we saw a burst of flowers (seriously the whole building is covered in potted plants).It was packed, it took about 35 mins to get a table but we were quite happy to have a drink and wait. We weren't disappointed - I had the spicy pad thai and it was amazing! So many flavours, the portion was huge but i somehow managed to finish it - although this meant waddling to the tube later on full to bursting.The thing that made it for me was the decor - there were plants hanging from the ceiling and even the loo was full of pretty potted flowers. Kinda like a pretty english flower jungle. Def recommend it for great food and strange surroundings.",

The pub itself is a reason to visit, the cozy atmosphere enhanced by greenery everywhere. And I mean everywhere. How the heck do they water all those plants? And the icing on the cake is that you get a large portion of food for a reasonable price. There were 3 of us eating dinner and we all ordered different dishes. I sampled them all and would have a hard time ordering next time because everything was so good. My stepmom is Thai and I know what good Thai food tastes like. Of course you can find better Thai food in Thailand or in fancier restaurants but I think you won't find better in a pub. Run, do not walk, and get you some crazy good Thai food!",

As most of the reviews mention, the outside is bedecked by flowers. The inside is equally cluttered with tankards, flags, chamber pots, Winston Churchill paraphernalia and Irish souvenirs. It all adds up to a very quirky environment.Essentially though, it is a London pub and a fine one at that. It carries the Fullers range of beers plus a fully stocked bar. Many people gravitate here for the Thai food but as I've not eaten here, I can't comment on that.Gerry is a big character landlord who is happy to chat to the customers.

The outside is incredibly picturesque -- bursting at the seams with flowers and flags galore. You walk inside and are greeted by a traditional British pub, but it won't be long before you start smelling the incredibly curries and other Thai flavors. Wander to the right of the bar and you'll find yourself in a beautiful oasis full of flowers upon flowers and a sit down Thai restaurant. (Don't worry, you can still order drinks from the pub -- we took advantage of that!) The spring rolls, pad see ew, and red curry were phenomenal. The perfect of amount of spice and the rice was cooked just perfectly! This is definitely a spot I will be making sure to visit every time I find myself in London!TIP: Avoid the need to make a reservation and grab lunch instead! We had no wait and the food was on our table within 10 minutes of ordering!",

There is absolutely no way of knowing there is even a restaurant in there.Initially we were turned away for dinner as the restaurant out the back of the bar was full, however we insisted we had to eat here, so they reluctantly accommodated us in the bar.I'm so pleased they did. It is seriously the best Thai I have had outside of Thailand. The duck curry is absolutely out of this world and the pad thai is perfection! Not only that it's really cheap too. Nothing like great food that is easy on the wallet.The service however, is absolutely shocking! The owner/manager is rude and abrasive, but it's worth putting up with for the amazing food.We will definitely be dining there again.",

    "text": "You have to come here with the right expectations. Most of the bad reviews are not about the food, but about the service. And most of the service reviews are about being told, often more than once, that you have ONE HOUR to eat. So, if that already bothers you, or if getting the bill placed on the table without asking (normal in the U.S., rare in the U.K.) don't go, you won't enjoy it.The restaurant is decent looking. Not a particularly romantic spot, but a fun friends spot. The pub is bustling, and the flowers everywhere is a sight to behold.My G/f got the Pad Thai with shrimp. Tasty, not outstanding, but much better once she asked for some chili oil. I got the Pad Kee Mao noodle dish with the three heat symbols, with the mix of meats. The heat was fairly intense, and this coming from someone who always gets Madras hot, and sometimes Vindaloo at the Indian. I'd put the heat up there near Vindaloo, but, for me at least, absolutely perfect, with a little burn, but not unpleasant. And most importantly, it didn't overpower the flavours of the dish, which were outstanding. I think the chef knows a thing or two. One of the best plates of food I've ever eaten. Yes, that good. And a bargain at \u00a38.50 for a big plate of food.The service was fast, fairly friendly, and the food came quickly. If we'd had appetizers (really limited choice, one being six very tasty looking fried egg rolls for \u00a34.50 I think, but we weren't hungry enough) then we would have been pushing close to that one hour limit, but with just the main we were done with no rush. I don't think they will bother you unless you are done, and then sit with your drinks, then they'll want you to give someone else a chance at this amazing food.Book ahead and prepare for tasty.",

It's an Irish/English pub as you walk in where you can enjoy a nice Guinness and await a table for the restaurant in the back that serves Thai food. As we walked in the back towards the restaurant we were greeted by several very friendly women servers; one in which immediately stretched out her arms for my 16 month old son to come to her. My son must have sensed her warm personality and went straight to her. She took him to the flower garden and showed him the fish and flowers as my husband and I got situated in at a table. We ordered spring rolls to start which were amazing. Very light and not oily at all. We then each ordered a Thai dish that had red and green peppers, onions, spring onions, as well as a choice of chicken, pork, or prawns. I opted for cashews in addition and spicy. Both came with white rice and were a perfect portion. It was extremely tasty, as well as, making me feel at home as it made me feel like excellent Chinese take out from home (NY). I would definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be coming back.",

For \u00a38.50 I got a large portion of rice with some vegetarian jungle curry. There was no tofu, which was a bit of a let down, but the food was okay. It was far from being the best Thai food in London, but really you are paying for the beautiful location.I would happily come back for a drink, or just to stare at the building from outside.",

Thai Restaurant, 3 stars but would return for sure... \u00a0 We have been a few times for the pub side of The Churchill Arms but this visit was our first Thai Restaurant visit. The Pub is just fanatic, quirky, British, fun, a good selection of Ales. Service quick and pleasant, as it has been on previous visits. 5 stars for the pub side... we love it....The Thai Restaurant part I knew of its reputation and its didn't disappoint. Running late with our table, and at the end of our meal being chased off it sharpish. Food is very good, and there is a good selection to choose from, maybe a little research beforehand as the staff are not too helpful with explaining about certain dishes as one of our guests found out. The wine took a while, and we should have grabbed a bottle from the pub side beforehand, as we had got well into our starters before it came. It's a 3 star, but I would eat there again as it is an experience and with the right group of friends can be very amusing as we found it. The Thai staff there are sharp, not rude but they will do their thing - their way.... maybe that's why people return to the scene of the crime.... we would, and it's NON-halal according to James who works there, so a plus for us.",

Run for many years by a friendly and gregarious Irish landlord it has all that you could want from a traditional pub: good beer, excellent food (Thai), and a marvellous atmosphere at any time of the day or night. Pubs where you can walk in and feel immediately comfortable and at home are quite rare but that is the case with the Churchill, whether you are a tourist or a local. I am lucky enough to be the latter and whilst not a frequent pubgoer I am a regular visitor here. Outside in the Spring and Summer, the floral display is worth the visit alone and the greenhouse restaurant inside serves extremely tasty and amazingly good value Thai food. The bar staff are friendly and efficient and one end of the bar is dedicated to sports on the TV and this is a fun place to watch a major event. Only downside - it is usually crowded because many obviously feel as I do. Hats off the landlord - his infectious sociability sets the mood. If only all pubs were like this.",

Inside, the environment is special and different from the rest of the pubs I have ever visited in the city. Very nice and high class looking people, no lousy drunks, no music, but still very funny. All the way down you get the restaurant section with a spillover of flowers and green, which is a nice touch. And a very very good thai food for a really good price (mains for less than 7 pounds). I don't give the place 5 stars just because of the service in the restaurant which can be very much improved.",

So I think that statement may be a bit too extreme for those who live in London, but this is coming from an American where the concept of an original English pub that serves good Thai food is totally out of the question. This venue is half English pub, half Thai food restaurant with a clean restroom to boot. While I was here, I had the most spicy pad kree mao with a pint of beer \u00a0- several different kinds in fact that went very well with my food. And when it says very spicy on the menu, they really mean it. I am pretty good with spicy food and favor it, but I had to take a pause after maybe 5-6 bites so that my ears would stop burning. All this while at the same time every time I glanced up, my eyes would meet Winston Churchill's. It was strange at first, but then he started to resemble someone who would actually listen to my problems and have some sort of solution to it. I was probably drinking a bit too much at this point. Well, I'd love to go back to this place again and again, but sadly I'm just a piddly little foreigner here. However, while I was here, I had a great time speaking meaningful conversation with my husband, eating good spicy Thai food and downing pint after pint of beer. Cheers!!!",

    "text": "I used to love going to the Churchill Arms for a nice Thai but after my recent experience will not return. I recommended the restaurant to a friend organising her birthday meal in London. Our table of 14 was booked for 7.30pm on a Saturday. The group took its time to arrive as the Central Line was down, but everyone was ready to order by 7.55. Throughout the meal our food was almost thrown at us, whilst drinks orders took 40 minutes to appear (not great if you're eating a spicy curry!) Our plates were cleared whilst others had only just got their food. Our bill was brought (without being asked for it) whilst some of our party were still eating - I take it they don't offer desserts/coffee?! Then as soon as our credit cards had been charged they literally evicted us - moving chairs away whilst some of the party were still finishing their drinks! Appalling service. We ended up stood in the bar, catching our breath and finishing our drinks at 9.10pm. I understand that some restaurants in London 'turn tables', but even so - allowing only 1h40 for a group of 14 to have a 'celebratory' meal seems ridiculous. I was so embarrassed to have recommended the pub in the first place - in the end the birthday girl took it well and we ended up laughing at the Fawlty Towers approach...A nice atmospheric pub, with good value but 'nothing special' food and terrible service - you can do better.",

At the second visit the hostesses recognized me, and by the third they were willing to accommodate us even though they were fully booked (I think they were also on to us that, as Americans, we wouldn't linger all night long over our meal). Regardless of the fact that it was within walking distance of my hotel, it has absolutely the best Thai food in the world. IN THE WORLD. A lot of American restaurants have a serious issue serving truly spicy and authentic Thai food. Not this place. Our eyes and noses watered and we loved it. \u00a0I couldn't tell you exactly what we ordered, but I'm confident that all of their dishes are delicious. As for the actual pub . . . what a gem this place is. \u00a0Always crowded but always welcoming. \u00a0My friend only drinks cider beer, and she was not disappointed. \u00a0And the florals outside--oh my. \u00a0A sight to behold. This is a bright light tucked back in the sweetest little neighborhood. I want to be back in London for many reasons, but most of all to eat and drink at The Churchill Arms again. \u00a0Thank you for bring such a memorable part of my trip. Please visit if you have the opportunity!",

You are surrounding with Churchill memorabilia that evokes a wonderful sense of yesteryear. The crowd is a full spectrum of young and not so young which makes it a good place to bring your friends (or your mom if so inclined.)There is an adjoining Thai restaurant with a friendly staff which you can order from and they deliver it right to your seat in the pub. As a lover of alcohol and Asian cuisine this place speaks to me on an existential level. Definitely check out their website; their email sign up includes a free drink.",

    "text": "Thai Restaurant Review!Well this was certainly an interesting experience. I read the reviews for this place extensively and despite the negative tones for the Thai restaurant, we decided to check it out simply because the exterior and interior of the bar is super cool.First off, you cannot make reservations online if you live outside the UK/EU. I tried and they sent me a denial email saying I had to call. Being that the restaurant highly suggests making reservations, I called England from the US on my dime. It was for my husband's birthday and I wanted to make sure we were guaranteed a spot. I called and the lady told me we'd only have the table for an hour and I agreed.When we arrived, the outside was really cool and the inside of the bar area was packed. We went to the back of the building to access the restaurant. HOLY HUMIDITY! In none of the reviews did I read how horribly miserable the atmosphere was in there. It was stifling. We were in and out within 30 minutes--between the temperature, humidity, hot food (review on that in a bit), it was totally unbearable. We were wiping sweat with our napkins. Now, we're from California and have spent summers on the east coast, so we're used to uncomfortably warm weather, but this was totally unacceptable for an eating establishment.As for the food, it was mediocre. It was NOT spicy (and I even ordered the supposedly 'spiciest' option). I think most of the reviewers who claim it's so wonderful must live in places that serve dreadful Thai food.So yeah, spending less than an hour here should be no problem because the service is quick and they basically hot-box you out with the temperature. As for the bar, even though the air was more tolerable, we bounced as fast as we could. Oh well :-/ Gave 2 stars only because of the aesthetics of the building.",

Table was ample and menu items sounded good. Ordered 2 different curry dishes. Both were good. Wine was a \"light\" pour. Rather than being rushed had to summon waiter for water than for check. Maybe because it was a Wednesday night. Upon leaving, noticed people eating in pub. Pub seating far superior to the atmosphere in back as the hanging plants on ceiling were yellow and looked as if they were suffering. Would have preferred comfortable pub seat and a view of the bar. Overall, food ok to good but atmosphere lacking. Unless you are hankering for Thai food and nothing else will do, maybe stand outside under the beautiful foliage and have a pint instead.",

During the after-work rush it took about 15 minutes to get a beer at the bar (we went for the Staropramen - a nice, middle of the road Czech beer). Without a reservation we only waited 30 minutes for a table in the attached Thai restaurant. The Thai food is awesome! The prawn crackers are a must, and it seems that you would enjoy any dish you order! Definitely check it out.",

I had a vegan rice and rice dish (the server understood this meant no fish or oyster sauce), which I'd requested mildly spicy. Now, I enjoy spicy food but I couldn't even finish my dish. So be warned! Afterwards, we moved into the pub for drinks. Nice, relaxed ambiance. Definitely recommended.",

Food is ok compared to all the Thai food I've ever had, but it's a nice spot for a meal. Staff were very friendly and courteous. You could get some nice pictures here as well. Just don't stand in the middle of the street like some one did. Go across the street.",

You could say this place is \"Instagram famous.\" I've seen countless of Instagram pics of this beautiful pub in London that is covered in flowers. The Churchill Arms didn't even seem real to me. How can a place so beautiful actually exist? Knowing that I was finally going to visit London, the Churchill Arms was on the top of my list of places to visit. When I actually arrived, luckily, it did not disappoint.This place is just as \u00a0beautiful as in the pictures. When I saw it for the first time, I thought maybe I had stepped into a Jane Austen novel. Flowers covered the entire building and it was like looking at a dream. Inside, the walls and ceiling at covered with knick knacks and artifacts. Most would think this clutters the pub, but I think it gives it certain character and adds to the whimsical setting. While at the pub my sister and I decided to have lunch. In the back of this out of world pub, is a Thai restaurant. I got my usual Pad Thai, and I can't remember what my sister got, but there were no complaints, so I think she liked it. The food was nothing special, but it was still tasty. I think the ambiance is what really makes this place memorable.I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to visit the Churchill Arms just for Thai food, but I would \u00a0say if you want to drink in a beautiful bar, this is the place to go.",

I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and my husband ordered the chicken pad see ew. Both dishes was delicious. We had another couple with us that really enjoyed their dishes as well.

The bar area is pretty small, but in the summertime it's actually quite nice just to stand outside.

Ok, so drinking options are about as standard as you are going to find, but the interior entirely mitigates this. It's like wandering into a witchdoctor's bar with low end of the spectrum lighting and strange voodoo like watering cans and rugby balls hanging off the ceiling, even a (quite useful) signpost. As mentioned by other qypers, the Thai section is a brighter palm leafed little oasis to the side of the bar. It's a wonderful symbiosis which results in an inviting and charactered spot to socialise in, ably assisted by lovely staff.",

As well as being a great pub to go for a drink, I think it serves great Thai food which is not only tasty but also great value for money. The only downside of going to eat here is that if you enter the 'restaurant section' of the pub at the back then the table is normally turned around in about an hour. So if you fancy going there one evening and are planning to stay a while, I would suggest securing a table in the bar area first so that you can eat and then sit and chat over a beer or three.

There's loads of other interesting collections on the walls an, of course, tons of Churchill stuff. After you're good and drunk, had the spilt drink trick played on you by Gerry and watched the sport, you should move to the courtyard at the back and have one of the best Thai meals in London.

The food is good not great, but it gets packed and it's always really uncomfortable. For my money I would go to a Thai Restuarant and eat in less cramped conditions and then go to a pub after.",

The interior is completely mad; all kinds of junk hanging from the ceilings and walls, WW2 propoganda posters everywhere, and a restaurant cum greenhouse selling Thai food out the back. If you can get here early, and grab a table, then I can highly recommend it, otherwise I'd give it a miss for somewhere less crowded.",

Dining without a reservation, we had about a 40 minute wait--not bad and the Notting Hill neighborhood is one to walk around in the meantime. Once seated, the food was solid, but the atmosphere itself was awesome. The pub is decked out with plants and flowers and while a bit claustrophobic at times, was beautiful. The Thai menu is not very expansive, but that's ok given the entire experience. The Thai egg rolls were a winner, fresh and crisp, and the cashew chicken had the spice done right--not overwhelming, but a lingering kick. The lack of Thai iced coffee or tea was a bit of a disappointment, but the pints more than made up for it. The restaurant and bar seemed to be independent operations, but that didn't distract. As an annoying American, I could do without dogs in bars (there were at least 2), but overall, the experience was pretty solid and worth a try.",

Omnipresent in this is the endless queue of pubs, most helping to further prove my favorite quote about london \"You know- fish, chips, cup o' tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary f*cking Poppins...London\"Here's the most normal looking pub you could find, then add a thai place around the corner of the bar. You know, the random bits and bobs, dark wood, 8 taps of fullers on cask, small woden tables, couples and their kids and dogs sitting around reading the paper, but then getting some pad thai and a curry. Its a concept i quite likeThe invisible que for tables in the pub part can be long and in the restaurnt peice it can be even harder at times but the food's quite solidIt may not be the best thai i've had, even in london, but the plates are generous and reasonably priced, spiced a little more to my mates tastes than mine (read: milder than you'd get in ny), the appetizers are quite small in comparison to the mains, but nice enough for them the main dishes come with rice without needed to order on the side (which seems to get more and more common each year)For a pint or three its nice to be able to get some craveworthy food right at the bar, likely worth 3.5 stars",

You will find all sorts of ages in this pub but thankfully without any noisy big parties or teenagers. The look of the place is incredible. The outside is beautiful with all the flowers all over the building. The inside is like gymnastics for the eyes - there are so many things to see and you bounce from one artifact to the other. There are pots and pans hanging from the low ceiling as well as rugby balls now because it is the season. The owner of the pub is always around and he is such a laugh. He clears the glasses of the table with his hooked cane so beware if it comes swooshing close to you! The back of the pub has a conservatory/ butterfly exhibition room which serves thai food. The thai food is very yummy and a good price. Unfortunately to eat in the actual restaurant you almos always need a reservation but the good news is that you can actually eat the thai food anywhere in the pub! So no need to reserve! I would definitely say this pub is worth a visit if you are in the area, beware though on Sundays it gets very busy.",

First, the staff member that accepted my reservation took down my name wrong. Second, when we asked why our food was delayed behind those that ordered after us, we got very uninterested and curt response. Overall, a lot of room for improvement in terms of service. Ambience was unique and interesting for sure. Both the exterior and the interior were a sight to behold.",

There is a lot of Churchill memorabilia there. Apparently he spent a lot of time at this pub, writing and sometimes delivering speeches during his time in Parliament as Prime Minister. I loved the atmosphere! The pub seems to serve mostly Fuller's brand, which was great (my favorite beer is the Fullers ESB :D). I had lunch at the restaurant (which is just behind the pub). They server Thai food, which was delicious. I am not a fan of Asian food, but I made an exception here. The food had the right amount of spice and paired great with the beer I was having. One complaint! The person who seated me told me that 'we need the table in one hour.' I was a bit upset because I was willing to spend more money, but I didn't let it tarnish the whole experience. Will come back.",

Its overgrown plant collection, large ale collection, and Churchill memorabilia make this small watering hole a must-stop destination for locals and tourists alike.Being the first pub to offer Thai food in London, Churchill Arms serves no-doubt authentic dishes, getting their spices just right. If it were not for the elbow-to-elbow atmosphere, this place would have gotten a 5-star from me. But I guess it's just all part of the Churchill Arms experience.Oh and if you sign up on their emailing list on the website, you get a free pint when you visit!",

    "text": "The 2 stars are for the exterior of the building. We decided to visit, expecting a really quaint traditional English pub and I'm presuming that's exactly what you would get unless of course you want food. In which case you are told they are serving food 'out the back'. It's only when you get out the back you realise - hang on, this is a Thai restaurant. My wife loves Thai food so even though this was not what we were expecting (who expects a Thai restaurant out the back of a British pub?) we decided to try it.The experience was horrible. Before we even sat down we were told we had 1 hour to vacate the table. The tables are heaped on top of each other, clearly trying to cram as many customers as they can into a very limited space. We could hear every word of the couple's conversation next to us (they were on date #3 and she really wants to try snowboarding in case you're interested). The servers just dumped the food in front of us, adding to the feel of being on the clock - no time to chew, the food will digest in your stomach. The food itself - not being an expert in Thai food, I defer to my wife who said it was just ok. It was not exactly cheap for pretty average fare.Now, the piece de resistance, my wife's digestive system has been suffering considerably since we've eaten there. In this day and age, it really is unacceptable to suffer stomach and digestive complaints from a restaurant in a recognised establishment that charges a tidy sum.Thanks Churchill Arms, for turning the last 36 hours of our honeymoon into a 100m dash for the nearest latrine competition. Great job on the exterior of the building. Could you now turn your attention to the interior of the building? Specifically the area 'out the back' that passes itself off as a restaurant.",

The interior is just as charming, although the hundreds of chamber pots hanging from the ceiling is a tad unnerving! Out the back there's a restaurant which serves Thai food. I've never eaten there but the restaurant area is wonderfully quirky, and feels like an indoor garden with water features and shrubbery wherever you turn. I'll report back once I've sampled some of the cuisine.",

Hey, go big or go home, right? It's pretty cool looking, actually. We shared a gin and tonic and left, but it's worth a look if you're in the neighborhood.They also run a Thai restaurant in back, which sadly we did not try due to their being completely reserved a few days in advance.

We (my guy and me) have Thai food quite often in the States, at least once every two weeks. We both got different spice levels of Pad Thai, and I wouldn't recommend the very mild one - it is pretty plain. But, my partner in food had the mild level of spicy and it was very flavorful and tasty! The waiters aren't super friendly and the beer was warm, but I'd still recommend checking this place out (it is cooollll) even if it's just to have a beer.

I ate in the front pub area. You go back to the restaurant area, about midway back, and order from a woman who serves as order-taker and cashier. Her demeanor is a cross between sadness, anger, and resignation. You indicate in the general area where you're sitting, and hope the server finds you. They do. I started with the fried spring rolls, six of them, accompanied by that pink-orange sweet-hot dipping sauce. The spring rolls are small and quite ordinary; even the sauce wasn't up to the task of saving them. My stir-fry (#11, with chicken) was hot in both temperature and spice. But it had a vague fish flavor to it, so much so that I reviewed the menu again to see if that was among the ingredients. No. I wistfully looked at the dishes being served to the neighboring tables; they all looked good. I'll try this place again (I enjoy pub interiors and the people who frequent them) but I'll try something else. The brewer's (Fuller) lager, Frontier, was a perfect accompaniment. I gave an extra star for the motley collection of toys and memorabilia on the ceiling, including a Focke Wulf fw190 chasing a Spitfire.",

Look, I know Asian culture, I get the language barrier, BUT the hostess was RUDE and she knew she was being rude. Server was slightly better. Food came out quick. I ordered pad Thai and pad kee Mo, with an order of spring rolls. Food was average. They didn't have Tom Kha soup and the server was extremely rude when I asked for Siracha. To summarize:Food: averageService: below averageAlso, they had 32 people crammed in one back room. That's just the one room in the back, the other rooms were even worse (didn't get a total count) There are better Thai restaurants in the area.",

I was really only expecting to snap a quick picture outside and leave, but when my friends and I were in the area, needed a dinner place, and saw it had 4 stars, we decided to give this place a try. Plus, we were pretty sick of English pub food at this point, so Thai food was a welcome change. Speaking of Thai food, from the outside looking in, you would never guess it was Thai food. It was only through research that I learned this. I also learned that it can get pretty packed. So when we showed up on Friday night at about 8 pm, we thought that grabbing a table for three would be a feat. Luckily, the place is pretty big, they told us to look around, and we eventually found a table not too long after.I ordered the pad kee mao, which came out really quickly. It was SUPER spicy. TOO spicy for me, but this isn't the fault of Churchill Arms, as the dish is meant to be spicy. But, I couldn't eat the dish because my mouth was on fire and I got filled up on the water that was putting out the fire on my tongue. Could have used some Snow (Hey Yo). I got the rest to go and ate the rest later that night. I picked out all of the RHCP and it was great. The noodles were palatable again.Bottom line, you should definitely go to at least check out all of the flowers. But if you want to get a seat for some Thai food, don't go at prime dinner time.",

But the thai restaurant, it wasn't that good, actually it wasn't good at all. The place made me claustrophobic, the plants were too much, and then food in there with so many people sitting so close, the humidity , o am sorry but I didn't have a great experience. They tried to create it pretty and may be it is for some people. I personally didn't like it .Again, the bar was great and so was it's historic significance.",

    "text": "I've been here twice already as a tourist that a local friend of mine recommended to me. You'll first notice the grandiose display of flowers out front which is certainly an eye catcher, but incredibly beautiful in my opinion! You'd never guess there's a Thai restaurant in the back of the pub and alas! There is. The first time I went, it was a group of 8 of us. A reservation was made and we had to wait about 35 minutes, but got seated. I know that the restaurant is small and I sensed that such a big group was a \"burden\" of sorts but we were taken care of. Albeit, quickly so they could open the table again , but it didn't matter to my friends as we were enjoying the company. I fell in LOVE with their sweet and sour chicken dish which was delightful yet affordable and a combination hard to find in my native Los Angeles. Because it was the end of the day, my group and I corralled at the front pub after we paid our bill. Some had pints they enjoyed, I did not. We had to split the group as there weren't tables big enough to accommodate, but we made most of the situation as people filtered out the later it got (it was a Monday night). The second time I went, it was a group of three on a Sunday during the Notting Hill Carnival so doubly packed in the pub, spilling out into the street. and we were served almost immediately with no problem as my friend made a reservation. I also have to give the 'Arms \"props\" for a lovely, clean washroom with a flower theme (as you can imagine). Delightful albeit crowded and loud, Churchill Arms is my recurring London spot to pop in to!",

The interior is actually bigger than it looks, but made to feel cozy with walls that a filled to the brim with various pictures, knickknacks and greenery throughout. A warning though, this place is very popular and wait times should be expected, but between the bar and nearby shopping, the wait time doesn't seem too long. The restaurant has a great selection of beers and wines that pair well with the Thai menu. The portions here are huge, so you could easily share a dish between two people. Everything is made to order and the degree of spiciness for each dish is listed on the menu.",

The show-winning flowers that spill overtop of Kensington Church Street and the hanging tropical conservatory inside create a display to admire. And as if the atmosphere weren't enough, it's backed up by some great Thai food in the city. Offering decent flavors at an affordable price, it's a win-win all around. \u00a0(Note: Judging from the mixed reviews, you either love or hate this place, but it's worth finding out.)",

Kind of funny since its both a Thai restaurant and an English Pub but I really like it. They have tons of plants inside the restaurant part which I thought was really cute and made for a kind of rain-forest atmosphere. You can walk through the pub and sit in the back at a restaurant or you can sit in the pub and order from the bar. I rather liked the restaurant more because I got to sit there and have a proper catch up session with my parents. You order beers from the bar when you sit down in the resturant so you get the best of both worlds.We got the Pad Thai, the Duck Curry, and this really yummy rice dish \u00a0with pork and onions and bell peppers. All were really good at the bill for the food only came about \u00a319 \u00a0which was really good for all of us.The only reason they did get a 4 star was because There was a hair on the edge of one of the plates which is ughhhh.... not COOL.

My first impressions were extremely positive. Arriving a little after 4pm on a Sunday, I expected the place to be empty. Boy was I wrong! I barely was able to get a table and the bar was two deep. Going in the back, there's a beautiful seating area filled with live plants.I ordered a glass of Merlot (okay) and spring rolls to start. The spring rolls were decent and plentiful (6 total). The service was good, as far as Thai restaurants go. Fairly quick, which wasn't surprising since there's an hour max on the tables (that's what she told me). However, right after I ordered that, I proceeded to wait for over 30 minutes for my pad thai. Which, unfortunately, was very mild when I asked for hot and spicy. Also, funny how a couple sat down next to me, ordered, and got their food in 15 minutes.OverallGood: atmosphere, the bar, wine selectionBad: very average food, unpredictable wait times",

I walked with an umbrella (which in fact I always carry with me) down Kensington Church Street to a pub. \u00a0In summer the pub is buried beneath an abundance of flowers and has won an award 'Boozer In Bloom' at Chelsea Flower Show! Finally arriving at the destination I was soaked in rain and couldn't wait to order a red wine.I entered a pub, which could not been more English. It was cluttered up with memorials and you wont be disappointed, there is also a picture of Winston Churchill accompanied by a selection of other gentlemen such as of American Presidents, British Premiers and a good number of British Royals. A varied group of clientele queued up at the bar to order a pint or two or three. At the Churchill Arms you order the drinks from the bar while as you order the food from the Thai restaurant, which is placed at the back of the restaurant- Apparently, it is a converted garage. There you find yourself in middle of a tropical garden, flowers have been planted and butterfly images hang on the wall.Be aware not to be given a table unless your whole group of friends have arrived. Due to its popularity the tables take turn every hour. The Thai restaurant reasonably priced food, I believe, is its major attraction. Pad Thai with prawns is my recommendation to start a night out.",

The Thai restaurant in the back does better take-away (in my opinion) - you'll avoid the painful wait... portions are American-sized and tasty.Churchill Arms does this neighborhood proud",

    "text": "This isn't any ordinary pub as it's been drawing foodies craving a Thai fix from all over town. The pub area alone is quite nice with a fully stocked bar, a wide range of beers and ales on tap and bottle, and plenty of seating around including a fairly large outdoor terrace when the weather is favourable. But the Thai food is really what draws the crowds because, quite simply, the staff and kitchen look like they've been taken straight from Thailand. These guys and gals are no-nonsense and all about the food. It does feel a bit like you've stepped into the streets of Bangkok as they quickly usher you to a table, push you for an order, and then within minutes your food has arrived. Add that to the slightly hot and humid setting with the smell of fresh flowers in the air and you can close your eyes and escape the City for a little while.The Pad Thai was delicious with supple noodles in the classic lime and peanut sauce bursting with fresh clean flavours. It had the taste of a dish made to order rather than en masse and spooned out as needed. I'd easily rate it as one of the best Pad Thai's in London if not in my experience to date. On the spicy dishes, each was well executed with tender meats, crunchy veggies, and a boatload of chilli flavour (despite there being relatively few chillies in the dish). Even the most leather tongued veteran at our table had to admit the heat was there in spades and more than a few of us broke out in hiccups. Yet it wasn't all fire with a solid depth of flavours shining through so that the heat enhanced rather than overwhelmed the food.With main dishes being around \u00a37-9 and each one a pretty hefty portion, it's brilliant value. Hell, a meal here costs less than the average cocktail at the bars/clubs just down the street.",

    "text": "I came for the beer, \u00a0stayed for the food, and left cos of the service. As advertised, quirky Thai restaurant in an old Fuller's pub. You get the usual range of Fuller's beer on cask - ordered a London Pride and ESB without even referring to the bar. The food is more than decent - possibly as authentic as you can get in London. Flavours are very, very close to authentic, although a touch sweeter and possibly a little less spicy than what you get in Thailand (I've not really had a lot of very spicy food in Thailand - that said I have quite a high tolerance for spice, higher than some Thais even). I had the green curry, missus had basil pork. Meat was a bit overcooked, and I missed having Thai fig in my curry. Still, convincing enough for me. The service though, is quite appalling. I've been to Thailand, and they don't call it the land of a thousand smiles for nothing. Nary a smile from the Thai wait staff from the moment I entered, til I left. Was brusquely informed that we had one hour to eat. Thankfully we knew what we wanted, and ordered quickly. Being relatively hungry and spice-resistsnt, we polished off our meals in short order, and settled down to make the best of our measly hour. Throughout my meal, the staff were gesticulating at us and plotting table arrangements, ostensibly conducting an academic exercise on how to accomodate more imaginary guests. At the 45th minute, we were served our bill without word. And at the 60th minute, we were perfunctorily requested to move to the bar area if we wished to continue drinking - I still had half a pint of ESB. This was despite the house being less than half full in my estimation. Look, I've been to Thailand. I know that the Thai people are capable of embarrassing levels of hospitality and politeness. I've experienced it many times. This was really a very poor reflection of the establishment, and of the Thai people. The beer is good, the food is great but the service is just a mess. I'm not coming back here again.",

    "text": "Came in for a quick dinner and pint before meeting some friends in Notting Hill. Overall, they serve pretty good but highly westernized Thai food in a cool pub setting. Other reviewers have already given a good overview of the atmosphere, so I'll skip right to the food. My husband and I shared three dishes: pad gra pao with beef, pad kee mao (often translated as drunken noodles, but not here) with prawns, and jungle curry with beef. We requested our dishes - especially the gra pao, Thai spicy. The server insisted, \"It's already Thai spicy.\" I asked if the kitchen could make it spicier than they usually did, and he insisted again, \"Already very, very spicy! We do not change the taste at all from the way they do it in Thailand.\"OK. It is what it is. I crossed my fingers. I am an unabashed chile head. When I eat most Thai food, I want to sweat and sneeze, I want to wish for cucumbers and vanilla ice cream to make it all cool down, I want to burn baby burn. But most Londoners don't want that, so I was skeptical of the server's claims. The dishes arrived, and I was crestfallen to find that they barely had any heat. To be fair, all three got the non-fiery flavor components basically correct: the curry especially had beautiful complex layers of flavor. My one complaint about the gra pao was they majorly skimped on the basil - that's one of the things that annoys me the most about Thai food in the U.S. and Europe - they often skimp on herbs. We asked the server for more chilies for our dishes. At first, he was reluctant, but finally brought us some. Finally, satisfaction! And the dishes paired well with the Fullers real ale they had on cask.When we went to pay, the server told us, \"Next time, tell us you've been here before, and we will give you properly spicy food. We've had issues in the past with customers requesting Thai spicy, and then sending back the dishes because they were too spicy.\" Lovely. Typical culinary bravado. I've seen it with meat too - people requesting steaks \"blue\" and then expecting them cooked to a level I'd consider medium rare or even medium. People, it is OK to want mild Thai food or a medium rare steak (though if you go more than that, you're dead to me - the cow has already been killed - no need to add the insult of mediumness or well-doneness to the injury of slaughter). It is fine not to want to cry from the capsaicin burns while eating curry, people! However, if you don't want that, do not request Thai spicy! And if you do order it that way, and it's too spicy, tough. Suffer through it. Because if you whine or send it back, you are ruining things for the rest of us. Restaurants are refusing to give us our heat because of chickenhawks like you. So man up or shut up. Rant over. In sum, this place definitely worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood. Not worth a trek all the way across London, but definitely worth it if nearby. Can't beat the prices - can have dinner for under a \u00a310 without alcohol. They keep you moving, too - we were in and out in under an hour, which was good as we were running late to meet our friends. But until they know you, they will withhold the good stuff, or at least the hot stuff!",

You'll most likely be choosing from the usual Fuller's choices. Still, it has to be better than Greene King!As far as the food goes, you probably know not to expect your general pub grub since it serves Thai. It's not very upscale food, to be honest, but it's pretty good value for money (and quick!). So if you're ever fancying a quick, budget Thai, this is a great choice.You'll probably want to make reservations for food, or go extremely early and try to eat fast so they can fit in those who have made reservations. I have had the Pad Thai and the Pad Kee Mau. The former has pretty good flavour for the cost, and the latter nearly brought me to tears. That's a great thing when you're looking for spicy food!The other thing I like about this place is the atmosphere and the interior. It's kinda crazy with all the hanging plants and the collection of figurines spread out all over the pub. But it's entertaining and not at all boring to look around in.So do try The Churchill Arms out, not for high-end pub grub, but for a casual outing that just needs good, comfort Thai food and pints of beer.",

I love the zany appearance of this pub, which apparently has earned it many a title from the London in Bloom competition. I also salute it continuing inside, with a veritable hanging garden of Babylon suspended above diners' heads in the incorporated Thai restaurant. And the food is certainly good value at \u00a37.50 plus rice etc.However, the 1 hour maximum table policy grates, as does - as with Steve B's experience - the pointed slamming down of the bill while we were still half-way through our mains. Plus the Fullers beer, though dependable, is slightly behind the craft beer times that we live in when it comes to quality.Still, definitely worth visiting for its highly unusual appearance alone.",

    "text": "I came upon this restaurant by sheer luck and fortune, and boy am I glad I can add this place to my box of memories!As a hobbyist being a Thai food critic, it must have been fate that my gang and I stepped into the Arms. Outside, the building is anything but unassuming. It is layered with natural greenery, and sticks out from the other buildings like nothing you have ever seen in the heart of London. But, it is hardly what one would expect to see as a Thai restaurant, since the facade is entirely modeled like a pub. And upon entering, the pub scene is only intensified. The lighting is so low, that it makes following the hostess to the table a chore in itself, but that only adds to the charm. As you walk through the seating areas, you will be visually bombarded with so many decorations that hang both from the walls and ceilings; do not be surprised if a plant vine, or old fishing net gets tangled in your hair as you proceed. Once seated, I remember our waiter being very patient and attentive, despite the tightly packed and busy evening he was encumbered with. When our dishes arrived, we all gladly devoured our plates within a few minutes. Stopping only to sip and talk over our drinks. After a 12+ hour day exploring London with my backpacker pals, this was just the place we needed to stop. The piping hot, delicious food and added environment made this restaurant a perfect end to a perfect day. The only issue I had (which is entirely subjective), is that I ordered my dish Hot, and it ended up being quite mild, so I asked for extra chilli and hot sauce, which the waiter promptly brought out. I would highly recommend this place to any of my acquaintances.",

The waitress said the table was reserved for someone else but we waited to see if the table was taken after the restaurant closed and it never had people arrive. We also watched another couple be seated by a restaurant employee only to see the same women turn them away. I have a feeling that they chose to tell us that so the kitchen could close on time. I am ok with that, but the waitress who told us was extremely rude and I had to ask her to quiet her voice.  \u00a0 \u00a0The exterior is beautiful and the ambiance is an incredible location for dinner. Book a reservation to help avoid this issue.",

You can have the Thai food on the pub area tables if you go to the food area order and pay, they'll find you after that.The Thai food area was very interesting and another masterpiece of plants and flowers. As for the Thai food its self I really dont know what everyone is raving about. Maybe i jsut ordered a bad dish, Pad thai and to be honest it didn't taste like anything and the Noodles were mushy.The experience and the service earned them my 3 stars",

The place is in a killer quaint area in west London, and has all the typical features of a traditional British pub, including the guinness flowing. You make your way through a dim lit bar/lounge area and head to the back. There is a gracious sweet Thai lady there to seat you.They have this super small intimate area in the back where they serve up delicious authentic Thai dishes, at a very fair price. Lanterns and ferns hanging across the entire ceiling make you feel like you are in a wonderland.My wife and I always share pad Thai and a curry of some sort, so here was no different. She got the pad Thai and I ordered the red curry with roasted duck, yes, roasted duck. It was amazing.If you are in London, this is an absolute MUST dining destination.",

Or you can finagle your way to a table in the bar, and place an order with the restaurant host who will deliver the food to your table.Restaurant: Not too large but they push the tables to get the people in and it seats maybe more than the bar itself. Standard thai menu. Food is a 4/5. I will say, one of our dishes was labeled spicy and it was hot as heck. I can handle spice but this was so hot, each bite burned my mouth and I couldn't take more than 4 bites. My dining companion managed to eat more of it but was sweating the entire meal.We ordered a bottle of wine and around the one hour mark, was brought our check and told we had to finish up. Listen, in America we understand not taking a table for multiple hours but if we have half a bottle of wine left that we purchased at your establishment and we were never told our booking was strictly one hour, that's just rude. We pushed off the 'you must go' for 15 minutes, drank what I could stomach (on a burned mouth) and left some vino at the table.As for the bar, always pretty packed. Low tables and stools. Must order at the bar. Great that one can get thai food while enjoying some brews.I know my review probably sounds more like a 2 star, but really, i do like this place. Just be ready for some spicy food and potentially not nice service in the restaurant. The food and joint is good enough to stand up to it.",

It was so fresh and clean and filled with amazing Thai flavors. Both the dishes were winners, and we're planning a return trip before our departure home.The two dishes we ordered were a level one and level two in heat. We will go with level three and four when we go back. The heat level was alright, yet we love our food really hot, so are more than happy to amp it up a notch or two.If you're seeking genuine, clean, Thai food, then The Churchill Arms is your place.

You walk in and it's just like any other pub, but very homey. It was packed in the drinking area, and it seemed like the place that always was packed. That's understandable, considering its location right by the Kensington Gardens.You walk through the actual pub area, and it's almost like you're transported to a different world with palm trees and patio furniture. Originally, didn't know what to expect because when you think of a traditional British pub, a Thai food place run by Thai people doesn't exactly come to mind. We both ordered some food so that I could try it out, and I was impressed with the offerings (though I don't remember the actual dishes). I had something they labeled as very spicy, but I don't feel it was a spicy as they said it would be. The waiter recommended a good Czech beer that went along with food, and I was glad to find a random European beer that went along with the Asian food.Ultimately, I had a really good time at Churchill Arms. I could look at the contrast between a traditional pub and a Thai restaurant as a plus or negative, but I just enjoyed it for what it was. I didn't to get to sit in the pub area in front (and the Thai food isn't allowed in that area), but that also looked like a fun spot.",

    "text": "Cue Natalie Imbruglia: NOTHING'S RIGHT, I'M TORN!So: top marks for kitsch and environment. \u00a0I have always admired The Churchill Arms from the outside - flowers galore! \u00a0Prime Kensington Church Street corner location! - but had never ventured in. \u00a0Tonight...we went! \u00a0The pub has a lot of weird stuff (I know, I know, that's a general term, but still: applicable) hanging from the ceiling, and through to the back is a Thai restaurant. \u00a0Thai you say? \u00a0Yes! \u00a0Even better, though: an amazing display of hanging plants, flower pots and lit candles all around the dining room. \u00a0It's like a magical conservatory with SE Asian flair!Marks knocked because: the Thai food was fine (hot fried vegetarian spring rolls were crispy, the veggie 'sweet and sour' stir fry was a little \"gloopy\" but totally fine, and my favourite part of the pad thai were the plump prawns that were part of the \"mixed\" option including shellfish, chicken and pork). \u00a0BUT, that said: the service was extremely rushed. \u00a0We felt forced into our choices, forced to finish, and then were told (though this was never indicated when we sat down) that we had to \"finish up\" because they \"needed the table\". \u00a0My *major* pet peeve was in the case of the bill / tip, though: because there were two of us paying (both cash) and we only had big bills, we put in over 50% of the final bill. \u00a0The server took our money tray away and...never returned. \u00a0When we caught him (long wait), he said he assumed that was our gratuity. \u00a0An assumed 50% tip? \u00a0Especially given the totally rushed nature of the meal and how we felt like we were being moved along at every course...that bold assumption just rubbed us both the wrong way, and I ended up feeling like a schmuck asking for some of the change back. \u00a0Meh meh. \u00a0Yelp note: come for the beer and the flowers, maybe pass on the full meal? \u00a0Just a thought.",

    "text": "Really cool concept. The Penang curry was delicious. Pad Thai was okay---would order something different next time (and all other dishes around us looked great as well). Generous portions. We watched the euros here and had a good experience--- plenty of screens. Good service. Would come back!",

And their Guinness is always fresh.Overly crowded and boozy most of the times, which is part of experience.Enjoyable local crowd and quite many tourists at all time.And they have a lovely Thai restaurant in the extension on the right hand side, which is both cheap and tasty.",

    "text": "A waitress came and interrupted our conversation with her presence, pointed twice to her \"not there watch\" and left without saying a word. I was a bit shocked, to be honest, I have never seen anything like this before. Apparently you are only allowed to have the table for one hour and we were taking a bit longer... shame on us! Enjoying our diner!Apart from that, the food is great and (most of) the waitresses are nice. The decoration is great: pub and thai part! I did not know it was really common to have Asiatic restaurants in the pubs and I loved the idea.I must confess I am thinking in the panang curry I had and I would love to be there right now!",
