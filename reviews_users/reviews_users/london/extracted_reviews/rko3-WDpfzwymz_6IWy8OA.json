    "text": "Probably the best dumplings served in London? In the cramped streets of Chinatown, it's easy to feel spoilt for choice in rush lunch hours. There are competing aromas in the air, the spectacles of hanging meat and chefs preparing to serve up specialties. If you steer away from humble sandwiches, you'd be richly rewarded by the wide range of offerings in Soho. So what drew me to Beijing Dumpling? Yes, there's the element of homesickness (I'm from Taiwan) and the real people wrapping up my beloved snack behind the shop window was just to tempting to resist. I entered the premise, however, with a healthy dose of apprehension: This is a first visit, and I've never heard of the restaurant before. It's half pass three on a Friday afternoon, well off peak. Bar me and my companion, there's only one table of a young family who looked to have consumed all in front of them. Encouraged, I ordered mixed mushrooms, shallow fried dumplings, crab meat (steamed) dumplings, Singaporean rice noodles, and pork dumplings in soup. The lady at the front window had stopped working and dropped back to have a chat with colleagues. She spoke with a Beijing accent (sounded Beijing to me!) and smiled broadly. As can be expected from many Chinese restaurants, the order in which the dishes arrived at the table cannot be predicted, but the arrival of the mixed mushrooms really did me proud. It's a lovely lot of shiitake, golden needle and chestnut mushrooms with a bedding of mustard greens. The taste of it quickly dispelled any lingering doubts and we settled to sample the beautifully constructed dumplings. OK, let's be frank, for xiao long bao (the steamed ones mentioned above), the best offerings this part of the world do not come close to the likes of Dintaifung (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di\u2026) , but we are in London. The trophy Beijing Dumpling deserves really rests on its handmade pork dumplings. The contents, consist mainly of Chinese chives and pork mince, packed a punch. Too often the Chinese restaurants in the UK tread on the safe side of Chinese takeaways and run a mile from distinctiveness. Pork dumplings, being an everyday item, should have long been recognised as a favourable alternative to sandwiches...Well, the jury is out, but we certainly can do with more dumpling eateries in any case. Areas for improvement? Dessert, dessert, dessert!",

    "text": "Beijing dumpling is a fairly new restaurant on Lisle St. Looks enticing from the street with dark wood, cool, dimly lit interior. You can see dumplings being freshly made right inside the window - must be a good sign! Inside wood tables complement the dark wood panelled interior. I ordered the pork dumplings (xiao long bao). These are the ones that come with some soup inside and vinegar dipping sauce. \u00a0You can take a tiny bite to burst the skin and suck out the delicious soup lurking inside.I'd experienced this type of dumpling before on a trip to Shanghai at a hugely bustling place that only served pork + crab soup dumplings. Those dumplings were so good that the punters, including me, were going just crazy ordering basket after basket (each giant bamboo steamer holding 17). The xiao long bao at Beijing noodle were a little more modest but still tasted good although a little smaller and less soupy. Probably unfair to compare to a venerated institution in Shanghai that but that was my previous reference point.My second dish of Szechuan chicken was a bit less successful as it was coated in that gloopy bright red sauce with a few pepper chunks and chilli slices thrown in. \u00a0This was more like your standard high street 'sweet and sour' kind of sauce but spiced up a bit so wasn't too impressed.My partner's Malaysian noodles was definitely better having pieces of squid that were notable for being tender vs. those rolls of white rubber squid that some places serve up.My thinking here is that choosing the right dishes is probably key so would probably need to try a few different things. Beer served in a smallish glass, not from the bottle and not cold.Overall 3 stars, maybe 3.5 based on overall experience.",

    "text": "To be fair, I think this place is more 3 and 1/2 stars. We got the chicken xiao long bao, pork xiao long bao and the Aubergine plate (yu xiang qie zi). 1. quality of the xiao long bao was so-so. it could use more soup, and the skin could be less dry around the top. the sauce they provided was good, but i never think it's too much to add a little scallion or extra drop of sesame oil or something that really would make the dipping sauce. 2. aubergine/eggplant dish - granted it was a decent dish, it's no where close to the authentic taste of Yu-Xiang. But then again, what do I expect? This isn't China. I've had some amazing Yu-Xiang eggplant in Maryland (U.S.A. and never found again elsewhere in the States).The window with the people ,making the dumplings is a nice touch, but makes me feel a bit like a touristy sucker who fell for it. Also, the name \"Beijing Dumpling\" was the line, hook and sinker for me. I grew up in Beijing as a kid! Spent half the time ogling the couple close to the door way because they got the peking duck wraps. But somehow I get a sneaky feeling that it probably just looked good, and I'd be disappointed again. I think you'd like this place if you have no expectations. Mine were set too high =(Bonus point for the waitress who replaced our 7-up that came out flat, and brought out a new one with the can to make sure we got a fresh can. The space itself was very nice! So definitely a pleasant place to eat in.Does London not have any dirty hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants where they seat you next to random strangers at a round table, and can donate your leftovers to an old granny more than happy to take it home?",

We had a variety of dishes but the stand out ones were the chicken dumplings and salt and pepper prawns - both were absolutely gorgeous, so impressed! Also had a lovely bottle of prossecco for only \u00a319 which is remarkably cheap for central London. The place itself is very cute, very buzzy with lots of Chinese people eating there which is always a good sign. The food and drink are very reasonably priced and good portions. The seating is benches so might not be the sort of place you go to and stop all night but fine for popping in on a night out. So impressed with this place - will definitely be back.",

The frontage is very alluring with two chefs busy making dumplings and the interior is busy and cosy with dark wood surrounds. The menu is surprisingly sparse of dumpling options given the restaurant's name and you choose much like at many other dumpling places such as Ping Pong. New to Beijing Dumplings I chose three options at random - chicken fried rice, pan fried pork dumplings and pork bao. First to arrive was the rice. It was very disappointing as the chicken looked more boiled; very anaemic and fatty and there was almost no taste to the entire dish. Next was the pork bao, this was much nicer with 8 dumplings in all. It was flavourful and filling. Last, the pan-fried, had a lovely texture but sadly very little taste to it. Also worth noting, the staff are efficient but a little impersonal. Lots of potential seen as restaurants like Ping Pong are almost twice as expensive, but I wouldn't return in a hurry.",

One of them was shaped like a perfect little fish complete with little orange eyes. In the hustle and bustle of Chinatown it would be all too easy to overlook this little gem, but to my mind they make some of the best dumplings in London. Give them a go you wont be disappointed. UPDATE Sadly I came back to Beijing Dumpling for a repeat of my previously good experience. Unfortunately I was faced with bland dumplings that all tasted the same. The salt and pepper squid was not bad but not good enough for me to justify the 5star rating, unfortunately I feel Beijing Dumpling is now a 3 star establishment.",

Although its name suggests food from Beijing, the decor, ambiance and some crossover food items on the menu like xiao long bao show a lot of similarity to Leong's Legends a few doors down, which serves Taiwanese food.The similarity comes down to being able to watch the chefs make dumplings in the shop window. Making xiao long bao is a real art to make a thin enough skin to make it tasty and now over-chewy but strong enough to hold the soup inside the dumpling without tearing.The seating inside is on wooden benches and tables reminiscent of Hong Kong kung fu movies, a strend started by the original Leong's Legends restaurant on Macclesfield StreetI ordered zha jiang noodles from the street food section part of the menu and some spicy pork xiao long bao. The zha jiang noodles came with thick udon sized noodles and a thick sweet and spicy sauce. It filled a spot but I think I prefer dan dan noodles.The xiao long bao were really good - better than the ones at Leong's Legends, which are rather thick-skinned. The only slight reservation is that the spicy pork ones tasted just like regular pork xiao long bao.Although the dishes at this restaurant are also available at other eateries in Chiantown, this is a good addition to Lisle Street",

    "text": "Oh, I love this place. Thanks YELP London for introducing this place to me! I had time today for a sit down lunch, so I went to Beijing Dumpling, plus I was craving chinese fooddd soo much, and xiao long baos? OH YES! This place is so close to the tube, I only stopped because I saw people making the xiao long baos in the window and I looked up and was interested only to realize it's where my destination is! I came at 2, there was only one other person there at the time...and like 3 servers and 2 xiao long bao makers... You can watch them make it if you stand outside the window, a little weird, but hey, if you interested...They seated me, and I asked if I can switch to a bigger table, since yenno, there was no one there and i wanted to put my bag and coat next to me, but I didn't realize they had hooks on the wall, but nonetheless, i like big tables. So they gave me a table that can sit 4..LOL, usually parties of 2 get these. The servers are very polite, can be more cheery though, some of them... I ordered the \"spicy sichuan dandan noodles\" and the pork xiao long baos. Each was 5 pounds.My noodles came pretty quick, and my oh my, were they delicious in their own little way, and the fact that I was starving!! It's not regular dan dan noodles I was used to, and I've been to china and all that jazz, so I know how it goes! But these seem legit, though very very thick, kinda like udon, except better? The soup was not too spicy, it was perfect, and I cannot handle much spicy, so I guess it's definitely toned down a notch.The xiao long baos came slightly afterwards, and it comes in 8 of them. They are mini xiao long baos...I was worried it would be too much, cause really, me and noodles and 8 gigantic xiao long baos?!?! After getting over the shock at their size, i took my chopstick, grabbed one, dipped it into the vinegar, and with my spoon, pinched a little hole, sucked up the soup...mmMMMMMMmmmm. SO GOOD. I love the fact that it didn't rip when i picked it up, NONE OF THEM DID!! The skin was soo soft, so fresh, so moist, but not too moist/soggy, and it wasn't hard, it was just..perfection. It tasted so good too. It's almost as good as shanghai ones. I would come back just for the xiao long baos... wow London, you keep on impressing me! Oh, this place is mighty big too, downstairs wasn't opened, but there are more tables there...and the top floor is quite large too if you keep walking. Bathrooms are downstairs! Oh, and everyone that came pretty much ordered the same thing, xiao long baos...and maybe dan dan noodles.",

Uh... want!Friend: So... would you rather eat here than cook at home?Me: I mean... it looks pretty good...Friend: Then let's do it!I can't complain when life's tough decisions are handed to me on a silver platter. Or, in this case, a bamboo steaming tray...... because -of course- we scored some xiao long bao. I mean... I don't remember the last time I had some. And especially ones that made me go 'Nom!'Meanwhile, the dan dan noodles were savoury and spicy, but not of the Szechuan peppercorn variety. Same situation on the mapo tofu. It's unclear whether or not these dishes have been toned down for the British palate, but they differed from the numbing delightfulness I'm used to. No matter - we thoroughly enjoyed each dish, regardless.Combined with the pleasant, legit Mandarin-speaking service and a comfortable interior featuring lots of dark wood, Beijing Dumpling offers plenty of reasons to return. I'm especially curious to learn more about their hand-pulled noodles and their zha jiang mian!",

    "text": "This is a review on BD's hot pot / steam boat, not their XLB. This is only time I've had hotpot in London, and it was some time last year so my memory is a bit foggy! \u00a0for those unfamiliar with hot pot, it's a communal pot of soup where you cook your food in the soup at your table! \u00a0You get a range of veggies, Chinese greens and mushrooms, fish and beef balls, tofu, assorted meats, noodles, dumplings, etc and while there are different soups, the common standard is a split pot with spicy Szechuan soup, and a simple stock. Perfect for cold winter days where you feel like you're just wrapped in a warm blanket the entire evening. For \u00a322ish/person, you get unlimited hot pot with 1.5-2 hours of eating time. \u00a0I think the soup is around \u00a310 for the pot. I think 6-7 people per pot is the max to share one pot, with more people you might want 2 pots. The variety of food is alright. I can't compare it to any other place (for now), but I think this is decent value for Chinese food. On the plus side, they have a very good selection of sauces and toppings that you can mix together (satay sauce, chili oil, peanut sauce, garlic, coriander etc). Restaurants *usually* charge for anything other than soy sauce. The sauces and toppings are listed on the menu so be sure to specify what you want. They tried to just give soy, but I'm like no ma'am, I want it all!!Service was ok, but my biggest gripe is that you can take home any wasted food but you will be charged \u00a39/box. Understood - but we were unfairly being given insane amounts of food when we were being careful to order adequate amounts. \u00a0I love my veg, I really do. But they gave us a huge mountain of veg/tofu along with a decent plate of meat, and certain things we didn't even order. We had a second round and asked for 1 order of a couple of items (1 order is usually 2-3 pieces) for the 3 of us to share. They brought over what seemed like 4 orders of everything. Massive plate of meat. 15 dumplings. 8 pieces of tofu. A big pile of squid. Surely this isn't 1 order.. But I think we were being stuffed to the max in hopes we'd not finish and have to pay for the excess in the end. Not a good way to do business. I would go back bc I like the food and variety in sauces. But if they try to give me excessive food, I'm gonna have something to say about that.",

    "text": "We came here on the assumptions that they would do a huge selection of dumplings as its in the restaurant name. When we looked at the menu we were surprised to only find a few dumpling dishes. It didn't put us off that much and we ended up getting one pork dumpling dish, dry beef noodles, garlic chicken and prawn toast. The prawn toast arrived as a starter and we were very underwhelmed. For a \u00a36 starter you would expect something special but it was 4 tiny soggy pieces that you would expect to receive from a bad takeaway. The two mains arrived shortly after and we were very happy again. The noodle dish was incredible and the portion sizes were huge. The dumplings arrived last as they are cooked fresh to order, again this was absolutely amazing. It's very confusing how some dishes can be so poor but others be great. (Visit - 12/05/2015 Dinner)",

There were maybe three other people in the restaurant and the host/waiter told us it would be 30 minutes to an hour to get food. We decided against it, turned around and walked out. I think one of our party said \"Nah, screw it. Let's go somewhere else\". The host then followed us out onto the street and shouted at us to \"Go home and f*** your mothers!\" before storming back into the restaurant. Needless to say, we were pretty shocked at that.He was incredibly lucky in a city like London that we weren't the type of people to kick his head in. Because there definitely are people out there who would have and he's playing a dangerous game flying off the handle like that at a group of (mostly) men late on a Friday night. I certainly won't be going back after that. No food is worth someone treating you like dirt because you don't want to wait up to an hour to order food in a nearly empty restaurant.",

    "text": "I knew this place was going to be a firm favourite, but it's not fair to say that after just one visit, right? Right.Since our first visit was at a slow time of day, I figured we'd hit BD's (can I give them a nickname? is it too soon?) on a Sunday night. Sure enough, it was buzzing. The dining room was divided nearly in half, with white folks seated up at the front and all the Chinese diners clustered around the cosier space in the back, near the bar. We ended up getting tucked into the back area, which was perfect--my darker-haired half got to see just how much of her Mandarin language classes she'd retained, and the atmosphere was more convivial than intimate.So how was BD on a busier night? Food came out just as fast, and everything was just as good, so they clearly run a tight ship.Spicy pork xiao long bao do not disappoint--the spice is pleasant and a little on the mild side, so make sure you ask for the chilli oil if they don't offer it first. If you aren't familiar with 'soup dumplings', you will inevitably burn yourself with the first one, no matter how many people warn you. Consider it a rite of passage.We opted for enoki and wild mushrooms, as well as chicken fried in garlic. Both dishes were perfect, not greasy, and neither was overwhelmed with sauce. Portions are generous.The classic cold cucumber salad is, and always will be, one of those things we just 'have' to have. Sesame oil, salt, soy, garlic, chillies, cucumbers? Perfection. Also good for soothing your scalded tongue when you bite into a xiao long bao too soon.Share a pot of Chinese tea (usually jasmine) and you'll come out under \u00a330.",

So I get in, they hand me over the menu and my eyes are delighted to see the different choices of xiao long bao on it. Unfortunately the waitress is telling me that all the dumplings have been sold out, and there's only the spicy pork xiao long bao left. I must admit that made me pretty sad :(The xiao long bao were quite good, not great for home made, but more than decent. I mean you can't be too difficult on xiao long bao when you come from Paris (we have like near to zero choice here) I also order a crab and chicken soup, which i usually LOVE, but this one was strange. It tasted more like water then soup, plus the quantity is small and quality average.What I would recommend though is the Singapore style noodles and the fried pork cooked in salt/pepper style. The noodle portion was big enough for two and really tasting. The fried Pork was perfect. If you like food with stronge taste and spice, go for the salt and pepper pork! It was tender, tasty, just perfect.The area is very touristic so you won't find the cheapest food here, but Beijing Dumpling has some pretty decent pricing though.",

    "text": "There's one main reason to come here - warm, wet balls. I'm talking about xiao long bao of course (or XLB simplicity). Beijing Dumpling is one of a few dumpling specialists that have recently arisen in Chinatown and have added the much-sought after soup-filled dumpings known as XLB to London's must-eat list. I think they could be the best.The first thing you'll notice is the XLB being made as Beijing have cleverly put their dumpling-making kitchen right at the front window on Lisle St. This means you can see your lunch being expertly crafted and smell the pastry, soup and meet even before you open the door to the stylish wood-interior dining room. It also means that sometimes you can't see anything due to a crowd of euro food tourists with giant digital SLRS taking photos.There are 6 or so different variants of XLB or soup broth with dumplings in and apart from that the menu is quite yawn. The XLB are decent, if small (they come in eights) and have a nice consistency which means they don't break but don't taste just like pastry. Good job BD! Definitely worth a try, and if you have the chutzpah too, it's definitely worth asking them why they're called 'Beijing Dumpling' when XLB is actually from Shanghai.",

Ordered xiao long bao, hot and sour soup, and a cup of fresh soya bean drink. \u00a0The soya bean drink was probably the best thing we ordered. \u00a0I don't know if its because we have been spoiled in California and had better XLB - I don't even know if we should consider this XLB considering there was no juice in each one at all. \u00a0The dough was sticky and pretty thick. \u00a0I have to say its one of the worst ones we had.Hot and Sour soup -hmmm.... this is different. \u00a0Its very dark...like soy sauce dark. \u00a0I could taste that they put alot of soy sauce and vinegar in there. \u00a0Didn't taste like any of the ones I have before. \u00a0This place didn't meet expectation considering all the good reviews I've read on yelp. \u00a0Maybe we just went on an off day.",

    "text": "I hit this place at least once each time when I am in London. It is not famous like Din Tai Fung nor is it fancy but their dumplings are comforting when I am in a land of fish and chips. Plus, I like watching the lady in the window make them all from scratch which you can do from the outside if you are too cheap to go in and purchase any. Their wait staff is friendly and always invite me to sit at an open table while awaiting my take away order (exactly 9 minutes will elapse to steam some dumplings to go). Having done this before, I find that when I am traveling solo on business, taking an order of steamed zhao long bao to go back to my hotel serves my jet lag and confused body well when I wake up at 2am hungry. Even cold, they are delicious. Be sure to get some black vinegar and chili to go and they are perfect as a midnight snack...kind of like the cheap and portable version of cold pizza when I was in college but better! The location of this place is easy since it is about 1 block up the street from the Leicester Square underground stop. I have tried other soup dumplings around Chinatown but this place keeps bringing me back because of its consistent quality and taste. Like most thrifty Chinese, they won't charge your card for anything under $10 GBP so come prepared and bring cash unless you are placing a large order.",

A bit greasy and overpriced for the tiny 3 piece order), the chicken curry (decent curry, large portion, lacking flavor), the fried seaweed (eh not my thing), and the spicy xlb (good texture, good amount of soup, lacking some flavor...could have benefited from some ginger). Overall the food was decent, but nothing special.",

If you've never had a hot pot before its pretty rad and easy and yes you will get filled up. Trust. \u00a0Its essentially all you can eat meats and veggies for \u00a320 and your food is cooked in a double sided pot with two types of soup atop of a skillet thing in the middle of your table. There was lamb, and beef, and mushrooms of different types, and meat balls of different types (i don't know what they are i just ate them. Don't ask questions.. just eat) and beautiful shrimps and noodles and spinach and and and and... so much!Our technique was to just dump a ton of food in there and then scoop out what you wanted to eat in \u00a0few minutes and voila you eat the said meats and things with delicious dipping sauces. nom nom nom",

The non-spicy chicken and pork xia long bau (dumplings)was sold out by 6:30 pm so I took the spicy pork XLB. I know I'm comparing to the venerable Din Tai Fung.... But the dumplings are basically dry with just a hint of soup in them. The noodles are pretty good with the sauce showing less peanut flavor that I'm used to- but still tasty. Portion sizes are good. I just don't understand why a basic signature dish should be sold out so early on a Tuesday night- they must make all the dumplings at one time early in the day and not continuously like busier restaurants like DTF. \u00a0If they had kept a full menu by 6:30 PM when I showed up, I might have given four stars for the quality of the food.",

Perfect skins, rich soup, creative meat choices, and every one hand rolled and steamed to order by the wonderful ladies in front. If you love XLB and you're in London, don't waste your time at other joints (especially not Dumplings Legend).",

The restaurant was still packed despite it being so late and we were warned that they were out of the classic soup dumplings but other options were still available. This place had great authentic Chinese food and you'll understand why it's Zagat rated as soon as you take a bite of just about anything. We got array of items and everything was up to par or exceeded expectations. I will definitely be returning here next time I'm in London!",

I definitely ordered too much food for one person but I wanted to try different items and get a feel of the restaurant overall. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant although it was a little awkward when I'm facing the front of the restaurant and then a gentleman was seated at the table in front of me facing the back of the restaurant. The staff were welcoming but not overly friendly. I ordered the honey garlic ribs, pickled cucumbers, and the pork xiao long bao (also known as soup dumplings). I've ordered these exact items from a couple of different menus over the last year (I may be predictable lol) but the ribs and pickled cucumbers were the best I've tried. The ribs had a good amount of meat on them and we well balanced between sweet and savory. The cucumbers were refreshing and were not overpowered by garlic as I've had in the past. The xiao long bao's were good but I still prefer the ones from Gourmet Dumpling House in Boston.",

I could eat the tofu for days on end, so much flavor, you wouldn't know that it was a vegetarian dish. The xiao long bao was beautifully steamed. Only complaint is that they're rather smaller than what we usually get in L.A. The pan-seared dumplings had a crispy, chewy outside and flavor-blasted filling.Would definitely return to try other things on the menu! \u00a0BTW, the price for an almost Michelin rated restaurant is cheaper that what we pay for a Chinese seafood restaurant bill in Los Angeles. \u00a0Totally worth it!",

And I feel like I'm qualified to say that they are some of the best Soup Dumplings in the world, as I've eating them in Shanghai, where they originated, and at Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, which is Michelin starred. The meat filling is succulent, the broth is the perfect amount of salty and the doughy wrapper nice and thin. Both the Hot and Sour and Seafood Tofu Soups were excellent. And my father said that the Beef Hor Fun was wok-fried to perfection and one of the best he's ever had. The food here was so good, we dined here a few times (ordering pretty much the same items) during our short visit in London.",

I do have to say the taste of these handmade tiny dumplings is very homey - priced at 8 for \u00a36, it is also a cheap find in London. Larger size soup dumplings tho, are not as homey. And an interesting thing I've noticed as I was having the dumplings: they give vinegar to Chinese customers to dip the small dumplings but soy sauce to foreigners to dip the same dumplings \u00a0- just have to say here: with vinegar is the proper way! Their stir fry and other dishes are just average tho, but definitely worth going back just for the dumplings!!",

The flavors in the soup dumpling soup are great; watching the people make them up front really adds to the experience. They also are generous with their all you can eat hot pot, putting no restrictions on what you can get. London seems to do dan dan noodles in a soup, which is weird for me (used to dry), but they were still pretty flavorful. The potstickers are also yummy, greasy, meaty goodness. As with most Asian restaurants, you'll benefit most if you don't have any food allergies, but they seem to be a place that would be pretty accommodating about that based on a nicely labeled menu.",

It's not as great as Din Tai Fung (only in California). A bit salty, but then again I am sensitive to salt. The service is quick and typical asian service meaning none of the fluff of checking in on you. Waive anyone down for what you want.Also, why go to a dumpling house and order... other menu items?

The soup dumplings came 8 to an order and are a little smaller than what I'm used to in New York. The soup dumplings were juicy and flavorful. The pork chops were good and came with onion and peppers stir fried. Overall I would suggest the mushrooms with bean curd and soup dumplings both were flavorful.",

Just about any small joint there offers dumplings, but most of them use frozen ones - you can tell! Here, you can actually see how the dim sum are being made. Make sure you're not in a hurry when the restaurant is busy. I heartily recommend the soup dumplings in particular - they're delicious, and great value! (8 pieces at UKP 6). Do yourself a favor and order cheap Chinese tea, you can always get much better beer from the pubs around Leicester Square later. Stools are as uncomfortable as ever (Message: Order, eat, pay, go!), service is quick and efficient, if always rushed and pushy (same message there). But the dark wood d\u00e9cor appeals overall, the food is good to excellent (the dim sum better than the other \u00e0 la carte stuff!). No place to linger though, as I said earlier.If you ever go to Soho, go to Beijing Dumpling!",
