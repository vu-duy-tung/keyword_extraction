    "text": "After a shortish walk in London's latest attempt at warm weather, we find ourselves at the Chop House, a rather posh looking thames-side eaterie that does a sneaky lunch offer (\u00a322 for 2 courses, \u00a326 for 3). Originally I was quite dubious - happily the food made up for any feelings of being underdressed for the occasion. This is lunch done properly, with a great view of Tower Bridge if you get the outside tables. Both my courses were delicious, and the staff kindly accomodated my sauce/dressing on the side requests (I ate Poached Pear and Rocket salad, followed by trout and purple sprouting broccoli). The portion sizes are decent enough, thank goodness, for me to feel full up after clearing my plate two courses in a row - none of that big plate / tiny morsel rubbish here. For occasional dining, or a discreet treat, I would be happy to return. Note: there's a 12.5% service charge automatically added to the bill (cheeky!), bear that in mind when you look at the prices.",

Tower Bridge lit up at night, right outside your table, is magical, and it was a great place to bring a friend visiting from out of town. Service was pleasant, if not speedy, and we were at a table tucked around the corner from the rest of the dining room so it wasn't as loud as being in the main area. Would definitely come back in the summer to snag an outdoor table. Favorite dish of the night (and I'm someone who doesn't usually like desserts): sticky toffee pudding.",

Difficult to spread on the toast, and that cold, difficult to taste. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he kind of grunted and carried on. The main of roast beef and yorkshire pudding was lacking as well. Great gravy, but the beef was fatty. The yorkshire pud was so hard that you could have rowed across to the Tower of London in it.

If you are tight for cash they often have a set menu for a set price, but if you're not worried about money then just dive in! With all your favourite homely dishes like lamb, steak and fish and chips, you will feel like you're at home (probably a more posh version though). As I'm pretty picky with wine, a wine specialist was able to find a perfect bottle that fitted by specification completely! You will need side's as well if you like you're grub, as it's a bit on the small side. Overall I enjoyed my dining experience - simple food cooked well, garnished with a lovely service.",

Booked through lastminute.com so was a bit worried about if the booking had gone through and it was a first dat so didn't really need any more stress but Ph'd them the day before and after getting through on the 3rd try was greeted with a friendly voice who confirmed the booking and upgraded us to a booth.Rocked up on the night and was imediatelly impressed by the quick and efficient greeting by the waiter in the bar who instead of just pointing us in the direction of the resturant showed us personally and took our coats to the free coat check as well.The view out over tower bridge was magic and waitress was quickly with us to offer a choice of free breads to snack on while we looked over the set menu to make our choice of some mouth watering dishes (I had had a light lunch so was quite hungry). Wine selection was good but remember to look in the back for wine by the glass as everything else is by the bottle.Staters came out and instead of looking like something just warmed up they looked and tasted great. empty plates where wisked away and after a short and enjoyable break to let the starters settle the mains came out and were fantastic.We both had the slow roasted pork on mash and while it would have been a bit small if we didn't have starters it was enough to fill us up. Pudding was tasty and well presented and once again the service was attentive without being over the top. They sent us on our way with a cheery wave and helped with the coats. Would definitely go back over summer and make the most of the outside terrace and great service.",

Then sat in front of our empty dinner plates for at least 15 mins. I finally bussed them myself. 2. Scotch Rump Steak - fat and gristle, but prepared medium rare and mustard butter; best mushy peas with fresh, meaty, lightly fried fish. Chips were think and mostly crispy.3.

Next to the \"chops\" there are usually some good fish dishes. Everything is slick. Staff is friendly and efficient. All is fine. Fine, not exceptional and for prices charged at Chop House one may expect something else. Neighbouring restaurants like La Pont De La Tour (belonging to the same group) offer an altogether different experience. Yet that's doesn't keep me from coming to Chop House. For a nice casual dining experience it is good and reliable. Ideal to have a quick bite after a long week at work. I've also taken large groups to Chop House a few times to wide acclaim.One tip, try to get a table in the bar area.

Location is everything when it comes to eating out, and this place probably has one of the best in town. The menu is fairly middle-range price wise for London and the food is pretty good. They do a decent range of shellfish and i went for some Oysters to start - very nice, but couldn't do more than 6. For those that want the ambience without the budget, they do a set menu for around \u00a320-\u00a330. If you want the a la carte the whole affair with wine is probably going to be anywhere from \u00a360-\u00a380 a head. However they have a VERY large wine list so you can really splash out here if you're so inclined. There are two dining areas - the restaurant or the bar. From what I could see the restaurant had tablecloths, but the menu is pretty much the same and the bar has outside seating with the same view. If you're after some food without the fuss, go to the bar. If you want to spend a whole evening book into the restaurant. I was told it wasn't possible to book the outside seating, so I guess this is an incentive to arrive early and nab a good seat. The clientele (from what I could see) was mainly bankers with their doll-like estuary girlfriends, but don't let that put you off as they're not total horays. Nice staff though, who were pretty slick once we were sat down.",

Unfortunately I tripped back there again a couple of weeks ago and felt that the service wasn't so good. There was a little confusion as to whether we were booked or not and ended up sitting at the bar for a while which I suppose wasn't too bad considering we had champagne cocktails. We ended up eating in the bar side of the restaurant so that we could secure a table outside and when the food came it couldn't be faulted. The service may I add was also faultless from this point onwardsWe had oysters, salmon, steak, all presented well and full of flavour. Its not the cheapest place to eat, but I guess that the type of food I like will never be that cheap in London...... Around about \u00a350-\u00a360 per head and wine generally starts at about \u00a325 for the cheaper range (Large wine list) This is my sort of place to eat in London and with it's positioning, who could ask for more!",

We walked in, had a drink and planned to come back in a few days.Unfortunately, our plans of dining outside were disappointed as the hostess informed us the patio was closed due to cold weather even though the tables were set and the heaters were running. Instead of cancelling our reservation we decided to stay for dinner and happy we did. Our meals alone, stood on it's own merit and while we still had views of the Tower it didn't ruin the evening. The dry aged rib-eye with peppercorn sauce was delicious and the wife had the halibut, equally astounding. Service was stellar, staff was courteous, attentive and prices matched the quality of the dishes. Cheers to the staff for making my birthday one that I won't forget.",

Waiter acted as if we were the ones had got it wrong and made no apologies. Pea & mint soup (hot) was barely warm. Dinners were all just ok (steaks, cod, veg curry).

The food was okay, pretty standard British cuisine. We decided to opt for the set menu with 2 courses coming in at \u00a323.50 per person. To start with I had the pea and mint soup with smoked ham and then the fish and chips. The fish and chips were good, fairly standard, there was nothing to distinguish them from any other fish and chips I'd had in another restaurant. I've probably had better in a pub to be quite honest. I liked the soup and the ham was smoked and chunky and just delicious. We also had 3 bottles of wine (between 4 of us) and the waiters were very attentive when it came to filling our glasses up which was good. They also swapped the cutlery around according to what each person had ordered and remembered everyone's dishes when it came to serving which I thought was impressive. Overall a pleasant dining experience. Food was a bit generic though!",

The view of the Thames river, well, not so much. It's quite polluted from my point of view.I came for the pre-fixe lunch menu, 3 courses for \u00a322. I started off with the salmon. Nice, fresh, very vibrant color. It came with half a lemon to give it a great tangy flavor. It also came with some potato salad. I wasn't a fan of it. It really didn't compliment the salmon.For the main course, I ordered the pork chops. I figured that since this place is a chop house that the most logical sense was to get the pork chops. Not in this case. Very hard, and dry. And not at all tasteful. The applesauce was decent though.And for dessert, I went with their sticky toffee cake. Nice, warm and sticky. The cake was a bit dry, but my views of the Tower Bridge and the walkers and runners right next to me kept me entertained enough to get through this dry cake.I also enjoyed my views with a nice cold Cotswold premium lager.",

Probably my most memorable meal on my entire Europe trip.Set on the Thames right by London Tower Bridge, BWCH has got a great view for sure. In fact, I absolutely LOVE the wharf area (was staying at the Guoman Hotel across the river) for its industrial feel. The interior is decked with wood, and I love the airiness and it gives to the space. Had a late dinner with the family, starting about 830ish. We sat outside on the patio area, and it was just amazing. Our servers were courteous and helped us through the menu, which was nice especially since we were being touristy. The sister and I both opted for the Best of British menu (a great value at ~25 pound for 3 courses). We went for sweetbreads, fish & chips, pork chop, strawberries & cream, and grapefruit jelly with elderflower sorbet. Amazing. The pork had a perfect crackling \u00a0as well. Mmm. Parents went for a steak and a salad, both pretty good, nothing ridiculously exceptional. Really, the standouts were the sweetbreads and the elderflower dessert. The sweetbreads were nicely fried up and creamy on the inside - just seasoned enough as well. The elderflower sorbet was so fragrant, and everyone enjoyed that one.BWCH is definitely a bit pricier as a dinner option, so it's good for special occasions or for a truly nice night out. I'd highly encourage outdoor seating along the river if it's a great summer night, and go for a time that'll get you ending around 930-10. That's when the view of the river and London Tower Bridge from the restaurant is really spectacular.Will be back here on my next visit.",

    "text": "The view of the Tower Bridge is great but otherwise nothing to shout about. The oysters were nice and briny but poorly-shucked; there were pieces of broken shell in the oysters. The temperature of the steaks seemed off. Or maybe it's just different standards in different countries. In any case I ordered a medium sirloin but it came well-done. The sides - roasted potatoes and buttered carrots - were rather bland. Oh, and the service was at best gruff.",

What a shame.The place itself is looking a bit shabby, the food was pretty good but nothing special, the drinks were over-priced and the service.......oh dear...it was a shambles. They need to sort this out - there are way more excellent restaurants in London than when they first opened - so why would you go here any more when it's like this?",

    "text": "The restaurant is beautiful and has a great view of the bridge. The food was beyond delicious. But...The service was sadly lacking. Some members of the staff were very rude and off putting and treated us like dumb tourists. Mind you we ordered a bottle of wine, 3 apps and 4 steak entr\u00e9es. The attention to detail was very poor and our poor server had 9 tables all to herself with little help from her peers. The Sommelier was extremely bored and not attentive at all. We aren't just some tourists who don't know anything, our entire group works in the tourism industry for a very large company so we know customer service and there was no customer service. Raquel, our server, was the wonderful.",

It was just as good as I remember - lovely service, fantastic \u00a0view and wonderful food. At the moment they are doing a really good festive deal - three courses from a set menu for 27.50. I had the game terrine, the roast turkey and then the plum pudding with brandy custard. The game terrine was ok, a little dry and I could have done with some chutney, but very pleasant. The turkey itself was a reformed slice that was a bit odd, but the rest of the plate was divine. The bacon wrapped sausage was outstanding and the brussels were luuuuuverly! But, and here the best was definitely saved until last... the plum pudding in brandy custard was probably the most outstanding dessert that I have ever had. Ever! Wow, that was good - hot, warming, alcoholic, just perfection!",
