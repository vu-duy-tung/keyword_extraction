On my recent trip to Fire & Stone with colleagues, I had high hopes of crazy pizza toppings and fun salads. But I just walked away feeling let down with my over-dressed salad. I also never thought it was possible to put too many toppings on a pizza, but Fire & Stone took the cake my coating a colleague's pizza with what looked to be a pound of diced potatoes. The only saving grace was the 4.95 set menu price. Work lunch-0, wallet +1.",

    "text": "This two-level restaurant serves stone-baked pizza made in what is supposedly the largest wood-fired oven in the Northern hemisphere. They draw their inspiration from a wide variety of international cuisines, although I'm not sure how the \"Casablanca,\" with wild mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in garlic butter, blue cheese, mozzarella, and toasted walnuts on mascarpone cheese sauce, relates to Morocco, since I don't recall ever eating any of those ingredients there. And who ever went to New York City and ordered pizza with smoked bacon, rosemary roast potatoes, caramelized onions, and sour cream?What counts is that all the ingredients are fresh and you could eat here numerous times without eating the same thing twice. Other options include two antipasti platters, one vegetarian and the other with assorted meats, both served with bread sticks; duck spring rolls served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce; and a seared fresh tuna salad with chilli-lime-soy dressing. It's not inexpensive, but at least you leave satisfied and feeling you got your money's worth.",

And I would probably freak out too, but I had to let go of the notion that I was going to eat a typical pizza, and actually I was going to just eat a meal that came on a doughy base.There were a LOT of selections, and I had a bit of difficulty picking. and I think that BOTH Raul and I were really excited by our final decisions, but the flavours were a bit underwhelming when the pizza's actually arrived.I had some thai chicken pizza thingy, where there wasn't any cheese, and it was sprinkled with peanuts. Sounds amazing right? well it was dissappointing as a thai dish AND as a pizza.But the deal was SO great that I guess you get what you pay for. The deal being that they offer 2 pizzas for \u00a310. And it defo is a lot of food. so you will leave there satisfied, but it did leave something to be desired. And I would only give it 2 stars, but the decor was neat, and the staff was friendly and efficient so they get an extra star.",

    "text": "I always wanted to go to Fire and Stone. It shows up on Top Table a lot, and as a huge pizza fan, I was impressed by its extensive and innovative menu, but the right time never seemed to come until a couple of months ago when a friend decided to have his birthday there on a Sunday. When we arrived I was a little disappointed to be seated on the raised level rather than at the massive bench down the middle with the pizza oven at its head, which had become iconic in my mind, after seeing the photos online. The menu soothed my disappointment - each pizza is linked to a different continent and there is enough to satisfy any vegetarian or meat eater. I went for the Casablanca (rosemary infused mascarpone cheese sauce, wild mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in garlic butter, Roquefort blue cheese, grated mozzarella topped with toasted walnuts and parsley). Once it arrived the toppings didn't disappoint, but the bread was different to what you normally get from a wood-fired oven. i am not sure what they do to the dough but it is less floury than you'd expect.I went again a couple of weeks later and this time went for the Cairo (roasted red and yellow peppers, courgettes, aubergines, balsamic roasted red onions, mozzarella and tomato sauce topped with crumbled goats cheese and pine nuts), which was again delicious.The price each time was impressive too - on Sunday you can get a pizza and a drink for \u00a36, which nobody can complain about, and on weekday evenings its possible to order half \u00a0a bottle of wine and a pizza for \u00a310.So on price and food, Fire and Stone was a winner, but the problem each time was the service. One time the waiter got my friends order wrong, then told her there wasn't enough time to make another so she'd have to make do, despite the fact she didn't like the one she had. They did give her a refund, but rightly so for a pizza she neither wanted nor ate. Another time they forgot the garlic bread and the fire alarm kept going off, and overall the staff were less than polite.So, if you're looking for a good pizza at a cheap price and don't care about service then Fire and Stone is a great option, but if you're trying to impress someone then definitely steer clear.",

The menu is set out in different world zones, its like chosing a curry, chinese or roast dinner, except it is served on a pizza. The imagintive toppings make this place interesting - my favourite is the New Yorker, with bacon, mini roast potatoes, caramilised jam and a big dollop of sour cream with paprika on top! Oh and the Strawberry & Pear Brothers Cider always goes down well too! The most amazing part about the restaurant is the deals. If you head to this place at lunchtimes, or sunday lunch you can get a pizza or salad with drink (wine/beer or soft drink) for \u00a36. There are not many places in central London that you can manage this for these days! Tucked away from Covent Garden it is nice to escape the hustle bustle, however this place does get busy! Now they have just opened in Westfield, im sure we can expect more openings, i just hope the quality and value for money remains intact.",

Fire & Stone have somehow found different concoctions to put on a pizza base and created a unique pizza offering. The room is large, with little natural light - the booking system is good although the confirmation that comes back via email has more rules & regulations regarding cancellations and surcharges then an airline ticket. I'd recommend phoning rather then using the website as there are always more spaces free when you phone. The pizzas are great. Clearly they use the very best ingredients and they are prepared very well. Service (12.5% added to your bill) is good. Pricewise - well some would say \u00a39.00 for a pizza is a lot, but the do start cheaper then that & as said the quality is great. We'd definitely go again and if you like pizza then this is a great place to go!",

But don't bother to go here if you like a traditional minimalist Italian pizza with only a few toppings (the theory is, the fewer the toppings, keep the flavours pure and not confuse your tastebuds). At Fire and Stone, there are lots and lots of pizzas on the menu and the toppings are varied. There are even are few extreme pizzas with outrageous toppings. (I love how the only pizzas with sweet potato / pumpkin are the Aussie ones. It's a very Aussie thing.) Actually, I think there is something on the menu to suit everyone's tastes. Service wasn't anything spectacular but I don't think it's that kind of restaurant. It reminded me a little bit of an upper-market fast food restaurant. The only thing that was disappointing was the pre-theatre dinner deal. We got a pizza and a glass of wine for 10 pounds. Unfortunately, the white wine was undrinkable. Considering that most of the pizzas are between 7 and 9 pounds, I felt a bit miffed. Usually I expect to get the glass of wine almost for free on one of these deals. We'll be back, but just for the pizza.",

The interiors are modern and open, and from the entrance you can see pizzas baking in the stone oven downstairs. The welcoming staff sat us immediately and patiently waited until we were ready to give our orders. Now to the menu The crazy pizza concoctions seem intimidating, but nothing can be more delicious! I ordered the cairo and didn't have to wait long to begin enjoying my meal. The wine list looked pretty good as well, though to be fair I had a glass of rose (which is pretty hard to botch up). The desserts are amazing, too. I had the chocolate pots filled with chocolate mousse and a pile of strawberries - for less than \u00a32! This brings me to my next point: the price. Fire & Stone offers a 2-for-\u00a310 deal on all pizzas during the week once you register with them online. I still can't believe my luck.",

We had a two pizzas for \u00a310 offer, which was a great deal considering several of the pizzas were \u00a38/9 each. As plenty of people have said, Fire and Stone specialise in pizzas with weird and wonderful topping combinations. I went for an Acapulco pizza, which had chilli beef, green chillis, mozzarella and sour cream and guacamole. It wasn't bad (and was served promptly) but would have been loads better if there had been tomato sauce as described on the menu - there was a little bit round the edges but that was all. The pizzas all look suspiciously uniform, so I was left wondering if the bases were actually fresh or pre-made. My friend and I also shared a chocolate brownie with ice cream, which was lovely.We had a bit of a problem with getting the bill and then the till ran out of change, which almost made us late for the show we were going to see. I would recommend Fire and Stone as a cheap place to pop into if you have a special offer and fancy trying pizza with a twist, but don't expect anything amazing or you might be disappointed.",

They take a tired classic and give it a gourmet twist, whacking all kinds of unusual international toppings onto a pizza base. I've been a few times because of its proximity to work, and even veggie friends and fussy eaters managed to find something to suit. From an Aussie pizza with sour cream, sweet chilli sauce, roast potato and chicken to a goats cheese and caramelised onion offering, there's something for everyone. The restaurant decor is nothing to complain about, though it's a bit cramped and plasticy. Prices are fair with some good lunchtime offers and specials. However, as with all Covent Garden restaurants, it gets super busy and this is where things get interesting Service seems to be a constant problem at this place judging by other reviews. When I've been with just one or two friends it's been slow but tolerable. In big groups, it's barely worth bothering. On a birthday night out we booked in advance for about 9 people. We were given a 'time slot' during which to eat our meal and got some VERY dirty looks when we continued to sit there past our kicking out time. We were only there because they'd not come to sort out the bill and process our card. Looking back I wish we'd just walked out. Service charge is added to the bill by default, but of course you don't have to pay it if you don't want to. This particular night, we chose not to. The food may be good for the price but it's not outstanding - it's only pizza after all - and service with a smile costs nothing.",

Why? The toppings are too spartan. So the Thin and crispy base looks positively thick when such a thin topping is applied. IMHO a pizza is best when there is still a bit of moisture from tomatoes on the topping, but these pizzas just come out bone dry. I, and others at the table (there were 10 of us), were aching for dominos when we left. And I'm not a fan of dominos. As an aside it's a bit funky, and there's good people watching. It seems that everyone is on a date there, and it's interesting to see the interactions. Maybe go if that's your thing, but don't get your hopes up about the pizza.

Sorry .. this placed SUCKED !!!!!! \u00a0Their service was polite but SUCKED too.",

Nonetheless it was an above average pizza. the decor was great, literally we were commenting on the grand scale of everything in here, made you feel as \u00a0small as an Ant! chomping on a big cheesy leaf and the long runway from the seating area like leaving a burrow! lolthe ceiling was akin to a multi-storey car park, you know the type that look like wash basins hanging upside down.",

Ok, so at times the menu does seem like it's been concocted by someone who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic, but you can't fault it's ambiance and prices. Another thing that Fire and Stone has going for it is that it somehow manages to deter the young mums and family crowd (thank-god!). This may be something to do with the fact that the seating is not suited to any form of family-dining. Score. Leave Pizza Express to the screaming kids. I'll take Fire and Stone any day for my quick pizza stop. On my last visit I tried the Bavarian Pizza, German sausage with mustard, cabbage, sour cream and other weird things. It was tasty but there was way to much mustard. The Argentinian wine I had on the other hand (the cheapest on the menu) was actually bloody good. A very nice surprise indeed. Fire and Stone, Pizza Express etc are never going to be 'must-go' destinations, but they do what they say on the tin. Therefore this Fire and Stone nestled in the heart of Covent Garden gets 3 stars from me. Bang.",

You really can't go wrong with this place, the childrens meun was \u00a35.95 for Pizza, drink and most important dessert. There was other dishes on offer but the pizza got a thumbs up from my niece!

The pizza base is one of the best ones I have tasted, thin and cripsy, just about perfect!The staff were friendly and helpful and very apologetic over the delay with the food.I would highly recommend this places for a quick pizza for lunch or even a more relaxed meal with wine and the lot, if only it was in Ireland!",

    "text": "Last night I dined here for the first time. I had the party menu, which gives you the choice of drink, veggie or meat starter, pizza or pasta, and dessert. I had no issues at all with the staff or atmosphere it was standard for a busy central London chain.However, for a place that boasts unique and curiously flavoured pizzas as its specialty, the pizza I had was, I kid you not, the worst pizza I have ever had. This may sound like an exaggeration, but it's true (the honour previously belonged to a pizza takeway I once ordered from in Bruges). To put it in perspective: a Sainsbury's Basics \u00a31 pizza is much tastier than Fire and Stone's offerings.I was with 10 friends and between us we tried about five different varieties of pizza. Despite everyone proclaiming at the beginning of the meal how hungry they were, only 2 of us finished the entire pizza (and it wasn't humongous or anything), with the rest of us averaging only about half. I noticed that most of us generously poured salt, pepper, hot sauce and even oil over our pizza to make it taste like something.I ordered the New York, which supposedly has roast potatoes, crispy bacon, sour cream, smoked paprika and caramelised onion jam. The toppings looked very nondescript, and I could not at all taste either the bacon, potatoes or paprika. The caramelised onion jam overpowered everything (and let's face it, it comes from a jar), while the base had absolutely no flavour: it was clearly cooked without any salt.I also tried my friend's Canberra pizza, which supposedly has roast chicken, garlic potatoes, marinated mushrooms, tomato sauce and chives. It mainly tasted like mozzarella and unsalted tomato sauce; the only topping I could really discern was chicken chunks that were not spiced with anything and did not taste freshly roasted.I'm all for unconventional pizza toppings, but please, presentation and flavour count. These pizzas looked like wilted flowers, and lacked any flavour or freshness. It was very disappointing. If you go to the Fire and Stone website, it gives the impression that the pizzas will knock you off your feet. I will give the place 2 out of 5 stars instead of just one because the starters (either a platter of delicious coldcuts and breadsticks with vinagrette sauce, or a platter of hummus, artichokes, sundried tomatoes and dolmayas) were pretty good, as was the dessert (a soft, warm brownie with vanilla ice cream).",

We had booked a few hours early just to warn that there'd be around 9 or 10 of us. When we arrived they had given us two back-to-back booths which meant that members of the party had to keep switching seats to ensure everyone had the opportunity to talk to each other. It seemed simply to be poor organisation on their part. The food was interesting; every pizza is named after a different city or location and the topping dictated by the stereotypical foods and flavours of that culture. The concept was a little gimicky and as someone of another culture the menu was a little offensive in its generalisations and quite frankly bastardisations of culture. That said I did manage to find a choice that was delicious when served. Another downside was that I requested extra sour cream due to the meagre quantity that was served with my order - and was charged extra.The restaurant was redeemed by their excellent polenta chips, if you go you must try them, but their poor service let them down.",

So the schtick at Fire and Stone seems to be Pizzas with unusual toppings. \u00a0They break their menu up in to Continents where they have 5 or 6 different pizzas named after cities. \u00a0Each one is basically a classic meal from that part of the world - but on a pizza. \u00a0I suppose I can see what they are trying to do - reinvent the pizza - but I don't think it really works. \u00a0Pizza is Italian and should stay that way.To give you some examples there is a \"London\" that basically is a Full English breakfast on a pizza (minus the beans thankfully). \u00a0There's one that is the extras you get with Nachos on a pizza and one that is basically a Tandoori chicken curry. \u00a0Also you know that amazing Chinese Aromatic Crispy Duck you get in a Chinese restaurant with Hoi-Sin, spring onions and cucumber? They do that on a Pizza too.Now I suppose some people might see this as fun or quirky. \u00a0I don't. \u00a0If I want pizza, I want good Italian pizza, not an unholy mix of a curry and a pizza.But judging by the reviews here maybe that's just me. \u00a0I wont be hurrying back.Oh if you do find yourself here and want a pizza that tastes like a pizza go for the Florence.",

    "text": "For my last night in London, I wanted to go to a place where my girfriends and I could chat over wine and have a great dinner, so when my friend suggested Fire and Stone I was like, 'eeeh, pizza?!' but I'm glad I surrendered.The space is sleek and modern. Spotlighting is complexion friendly and wood accents are soothing. It's good we made a reservation because the place was packed with young 20 year olds getting off work.The variety of pizzas are crazy! I had to get the London pizza - bacon, mozzarella, tomatoes, and black pudding! My girlfriends were a little grossed out I'd willingly put black pudding on my pizza but hey, if I'm not going to go extreme, I might as well get out. Delicious.We talked for hours and luckily our waitress didn't kick us out (wasn't chipper we were there for so long either). A group of about 20 sat down next to us. I was watching them, trying to see how their awkward, don't really know each other vibe would evolve after a few drinks. By the end, one of the guys came out of the bathroom in his socks and shorts, holding his pants in his hand. And then his friends proceeded to wax his legs tableside. Uhm.. whaa..?!?! Waiters were laughing along too so it was all cool, though kind of unsanitary... A perfect spot for my farewell to the UK and my 100th review!",

I went on a date here and totally enjoyed the relaxed vibe, the tasty brothers cider and the fun of choosing from their extensive menu.

He said he had delayed putting the pizza orders in because he saw several people still eating the appetizers. \u00a0WHAAAAT?!!! Well, they were still eating the appetizers because they were hungry, waiting on the main course to arrive.After we completed the pizza, it was about 15-20 minutes later before the desserts we had ordered with our main course appeared. On the way out, I talked to another staff member to ask her how long does it typically take for a party of 20. \u00a0She said usually two hours. \u00a0We were leaving at 10:00 p.m., nearly three hours later!The waiter was not apologetic, nor was anyone else for the what I feel was not very special service, particularly since we paid a hefty sum. \u00a0We may as well could have been any other table there. \u00a0I really was looking for a much different experience. I will not nor will I recommend any small or large group for this restaurant again.",

Having been there before on a theatre and dinner deal, I had fond memories of the peking duck pizza.The restaurant itself was great, with plenty of menu choice, friendly staff and fast service. The meal was pretty good too. The deep fried mozzarella balls were a little too juicy for my liking, but my pizza was lovely. Everyone struggled to eat both their starters and pizzas, so it might be worth sticking to just a main meal unless you're really hungry.A nice alternative to all the Pizza Express and Pizza Hut chains.",

Their pizzas are pretty amazing, they have a great selection of pizzas from around the globe, I chose the Cairo African pizza which comprised of roasted red and yellow peppers, balsamic roasted red onions, Mozzarella, tomatoes sauce, crumbled goats cheese and pine nuts which was really delicious and my date got the Byron Bay Australia pizza which was made of basil pesto, mixed marinated mushrooms, mozzarella, garlic and rosemary roasted potatoes, sour cream, smoked paprika and caramelised onion jam which was pretty awesome too!We got a bottle of Argentinian wine for \u00a316 which was lovely.",

Not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed one of their wide range of pizzas from a rather exotic menu, but I have to admit I prefer a more traditional Italian pizza.For starters I opted for the Aegean board, which was a large pile of grilled flatbreads served with huge dollops of black olive tapenade, red pepper & feta dip and tzatziki, all of which were really tasty. My friends opted for the crispy wonton king prawns which went down very well, and the bruschetta topped with parma ham and plenty of melted brie which was one of the highlights of the meal I think!!For main course I ordered the spaghetti primavera with chicken, it came with loads of chicken, lovely crispy green veg (sugar snaps, broccoli, peas, courgettes and broad beans) and the parmesan and double cream sauce wasn't too heavy or sickly either. Our party also ordered the smoked bacon and mushroom penne which was tasty but slightly lacking in bacon.I'll definitely be visiting again \u00a0I want more of their delicious spaghetti primavera!!",

But not in a 'oh that makes sense' kind of way. Because I don't think many African pizzas would have feta on them. I've been here twice, once for a work party and then with a friend and both times it has underwhelmed me. I don't know, it is just lacking that exciting element.I agree with Tom E. the only benefit is it is big enough to host large groups but only because the place is huge. Good for birthday parties I guess.My friend once saw a mouse run across the floor here... just saying. I'm giving it three stars because they have a good cocktail menu and the food is decent.",

I found the staff very helpful in securing me a table for 4 on little or no notice at a very very busy time \u00f2f year. \u00a0Now I will say they did inform me that the tables are only slotted for two hours which might put some people off but not me. It's a pizza place . Anyway the staff at the resturant were friendly and efficient although I did feel a little rushed to place my order but that is probably just the time of year. The menu offered lots if very interesting choices of pizzas both Vegitarian and non. I had two vegetarians in my party as usual. I chose the Peking duck pizza with cucumber and hoisin sauce. I have to say I was \u00a0a little worried at how it might taste. It was yummy and just the right size to satisfy my big appetite . The only criticism my party had was with the salad which she said was disappointing . I would defiantly go back again when it's not so busy. Give it a try if you like pizza that's just a little different .",

    "text": "Wow! What an ingenious idea, taking inspiration from cities and countries to create pizza toppings. You'd never think that the 'Peking' - essentially crispy duck and all of the trimmings on a pizza - would work, but for some strange reason it does. All of the toppings are, for want of a better word, weird. The 'London' - a full English breakfast on a pizza, the 'Acapulco' - nachos, but on a pizza. The main problem with all of the pizzas on their menu (or at least the ones that I have tried) is that they work. And they taste fantastic. Once you get over the fact that your meal is a pizza with a curry on top and just taste how good it is, you realise how clever these Fire & Stone chappies are. If you are looking for an authentic Italian pizza, you probably won't like this place. However, if you're looking for fun and good tasting grub, in a slightly quirky restaurant then you'll love it. The service is pretty good, it can be a bit slow but once they get to you they'll make sure you're happy. They make great cocktails, and their wine selection has a good price range to it. Overall a good meal out with friends or family and definitely one to try at least once. If you're not too sure which pizza you fancy, why not order a different one each and share them round. Best of every world, and a fun quirky world it is!",

Secondly, the service was atrocious, with the waitress not even making eye contact with our table for almost twenty minutes. Once she did, ordering was awkward and drinks and food were brought out with strange timing and spacing. The food was good, but not good enough to deal with the service a second time.",

I went here with an old work friend in a deal that gave us a meal and theatre ticket for \u00a330 each. We did arrive early (6pm for pre-theatre) but were seated quickly with good service, we each had starter bread and olives, a main course each and dessert. All were satisfactory as courses, nothing to write home about but nicely washed down with a bottle of wine.One thing I will say in favour of this place is that it's a great size and I really like the decor \u00a0there's something fresh, vibrant and cool about it.

I am thinking my pizza was a little overcooked, and then sat around and got cold, so perhaps it was an off day to go. \u00a0 I think you can get much better pizza elsewhere in London but it's great if you want to mix things up a bit.",

Neither of us had ever been there before but heard mixed reviews and I had suggested it as a dining place. Boy, do I regret that decision. Hope that she doesn't hold my restaurant choice against me. Can we still be friends?Fire & Stone is a standard pizza and pasta place. It was packed, so I thought it'd be great. If you're a vegetarian - we both were - there are enough choices for you to choose from. Are they good? Meh.We both shared the zucchini fries. They came QUICKLY. Service here is fast. I drank a raspberry bellini, my pregnant dining companion opted for a sparkling water. We both also happened to want macaroni and cheese. Both of us being American, I think the bar is set pretty high for a good bowl of mac' and cheese. WOW - we were NOT pleased. Extremely plain, lacking any and all flavour. Nice crunch from the breadcrumbs and a good portion size but what a disappointment. Dessert was worse - we shared a waffle with ice cream but it arrived soggy as if it wasn't cooked completely. We grumbled through the ice cream but left most of it on the plate.46 pounds for two people eating a crap meal? No, thanks! I'll save my pounds and pence for something better. Good thing Covent Garden has a lot to choose from if we're in the area looking for a bite to eat. Won't be back.",

Not bad for central London. However as exciting as the pizzas sound (unusual more American style toppings such as Jerk chicken, jalapenos, BBQ sauce and mango) the actual taste is lacking. Unfortunately they sound a lot more flavorsome than they taste. Having said that a pizzas a pizza and these aren't bad especially of the price. Cocktails are pretty much the same story. great exciting sounding selection but taste wise not amazing. Overall though I would recommend you give it a try its a nice place with good food and cocktails at a great price for central. Go and see what you think for yourself :-)",

I have to say it was very tasty but too sweet with the balsamic onions and sweet potato. The space is quiet large, with all the concrete and the pizza oven flume sticky out from the lower floor it was very impressive. Sadly really bad service. We were seated quiet fast which we were not expecting with how busy it was. Once we were seated felt forgotten. Long wait before the waitress took our order. Then our drinks were forgotten and had to ask for them again after our food was delivered. And when it was delivered one item was missing. Again, loved the theme and there are other pizzas I would like to try but I think I will go back.",

It's rare to find decent food in Covent Garden without having to wait.3) Tasty, unique pizzas.At the same time, I wouldn't necessarily come here if they didn't have a special offer. \u00a0I don't really think the pizzas are worth \u00a310-12 especially because you can go next door to Franco Manca for something more affordable. \u00a0The pizzas are good, but not particularly special. \u00a0I also thought the service was just OK. \u00a0Come here if you're looking for a no-fuss meal out in Covent Garden, and check online before you head there to see what promotions they have!",

In the top was a red chilli which I made the mistake of biting into. I love chillis, even hot ones, but this showed its strength and, the next morning, my lower extremities reminded me lol.Two fantastic pizzas followed, delicious, as our empty plates demonstrated.

Where else can you get duck and hoisin sauce or chilli, sour cream and guacamole on a pizza?It's always busy so I'd recommend booking ahead. Also allow plenty of time they're as it'll take an age to decide which of the 22 pizzas to order, and that's if you've ruled out the pasta! Three of us visited this time and as we couldn't choose we went for three pizzas we all liked the sound of and shared them between us. This worked so well. The Peking one was my favourite, followed by the Boston. We had two with classic bases and one on the thin and crispy. I usually prefer thin and crispy but the classic here is pretty good and not at all stodgy or heavy. I didn't give a full five stars only because the pizzas are a bit too salty (I'm on my way home desperate to drink four pints of water) and they could be a little more generous with the toppings but that's being a little fussy.I have been three or four times now and will definitely be back (with a bottle of water in tow).",

I'm not quite sure how they've achieved this, but there you are.Got a good deal via Tastecard, plus on their website they have some offers like 2 for 1 at some points, so it's potentially reasonable.",

I came to the restaurant with a large group of about 100 people and we dined downstairs. I left with the hunger of 100 people burning within me. The service was slow, and despite repeated requests from me and the few other vegetarians at my table, we couldn't seem to get ahold of a plain cheese pizza. We were instead presented with a steady stream of strange \"vegetable\" pizzas with unseemly sauces and strange amalgamations of meat. My friend has diabetes.",

    "text": "One thing I do like about this place is the concept. They offer pizzas that you can no longer associate with being Italian. Toppings you never expect to find on a pizza such as the London variety which consists of cumberland sausage, streaky bacon, chunks of roast potato with roasted cherry tomatoes and roasted field mushrooms = items of an English breakfast. The concept sounds good but sadly like most big chains, quality is missing.The branch in Covent Garden was huge and completely filled on midweek evening around 7pm. Staff were efficient and friendly which was nice but sadly the food let us down.We decided to start on drinks and a Tropical smoothie and Real choc chip smoothie was ordered. I really didn't feel this awesome choice could have let us know but it really did. The Tropical smoothie was so sour we had to ask the barman to add a couple spoonfuls of syrup in there to make it drinkable whilst my shake was so powdery I kept getting bits stuck in my teeth. Not a great start. For the pizzas we decided to go deluxe and chose to have both pizzas on the thin & Crispy Base. It was \u00a31.25 extra and was described to be larger, thinner and crispier base. Being new to this place we decided to stick with the customer favourites so we couldn't go wrong and with that in mind we ordered the New York and the Texas.As cool as the New York pizza was described, toppings including streaky bacon, garlic and rosemary roast potatoes, caramelised onions, smoked paprika, sour cream and chives, it was bland. In fact there were like five of each item on that pizza and sparsely scattered. It looked like they had a large budget cut looking at previous pictures of the same pizza. Quantity wouldn't have been a problem if it didn't taste so dry. It was baked too long that the bacon harden, \u00a0the cheese was completely glued to the pizza and became translucent and the tomato sauce was no longer apparent. We couldn't taste any garlic in there or any of the ingredients to be honest. Somehow all the flavours got lost somewhere. Better was the Texas pizza which was thankfully flavoured and sweetened by the Barbecued rump steak and caramelised onions. It was also added moisture to the pizza itself with the steak being surprisingly tender and succulent and the onions nice and softened. This one was worth getting for the steak pieces as I was still very disappointed the base, tasteless and overdone. They could have been more generous with the cheese too. We shared a side of polenta chips but sadly this was bland as well and had no essence of the rosemary or black pepper as described. We also thought it was wrongly paired with tomato salsa as it was impossible to dip the polenta in being watery and lumpy. If anything it needed something more thick, smooth and creamy, something that clings on to add taste. The whole food experience was a let down with only the Texas pizza worth mentioning but purely for the steak itself rather than the pizza. The base itself was nothing special, crispy as described but bland and cannot compare to all those new pizza joints out there. The pizza don't come cheap either, over \u00a310 for most pizzas and with that price you can get a much better quality elsewhere, two awesome Bianca pizzettes from Da Polpo.Sadly it's not a place I will be returning any time soon. In the area it's in it just feels like another tourist trap.",

What I witnessed was probably one of the most unhygienic scenes i ever seen in my own life.. A few examples were: using topping that fell on the floor, eating toppings/licking fingers and then touching the ingredients, flipping the burned dough and covering it with tomato sauce, and more...That said there were 3 chefs which were very good and attentive and followed a very rigid procedure. But that was the minority, the rest of the staff was untrained individuals with no previous experience or hygienic certificatesI don't know about any food poisoning incidents but i do know that not a single person from the staff was taking anything to eat at home from there which is always a bad sign. So all I can say is approach at you own caution.",

    "text": "My colleague had booked using a TasteCard which gave us 50% off food so we went for two courses; a starter and a main. As it was lunchtime I just had a soft drink but the cocktails here look delicious too.I can't resist anything with Parma ham so had the Brie & Parma Ham Bruschetta to start. Melted brie, Parma ham with onion jam, pesto & rocket on crusty bread. Mmmm... it's quite a big portion but every bite was delicious. I especially loved whatever dressing was drizzled over the salad which is saying something as I usually hate dressing.For main I had to have one of their weird and wonderful pizzas. No pepperoni or Hawaiian pizzas here oh no. Each of these bad boys represents the signature dish of a different city with toppings as varied as roast potatoes, chilli & lime prawns and avocado. I'm a sucker for avocado on pretty much everything so chose the Lisbon as my main dish.So, so good. This was one of the best pizzas I think I've ever had in London. The chicken had a kick to it without being too spicy and the avocado helped cool things down but it was very filling and I couldn't finish it, leaving two slices on the plate.With discount it cost us \u00a312.66 each which was amazing value. I've checked their website and they have amazing deals on a daily basis even if you don't have a TasteCard including their \u00a36.95 lunch deal, their pre-theatre menu and two pizzas for just \u00a312! Definitely somewhere to check out.",

Pizza at Fire and Stone it is.We were seated in the large downstairs area by a pleasant staff member, walking past and warming my hands on the hugest stone pizza oven I've ever seen.The menu is really fun - the pizzas are themed by country with ingredients matching what you'd expect from that country e.g The Boston = pulled pork, BBQ sauce and coleslaw on a pizza! After struggling to choose between the delicious options we ordered three pizzas and shared them so we could try the different flavours. They were presented nicely on slate, but it meant that we had to ask for separate mini plates to make it easier to share, and the pizzas went cold quite quickly.Each pizza was really tasty, and we were pleased with our choices and the size of them! We were stuffed by the end of our meal.The only downside was the slow service. Whilst the staff were nice, they weren't particularly attentive and we had to wait quite a while to catch anyone's attention to order more drinks or pay for the bill, despite tue restaurant being quite empty by the time we were ready to leave. I was also freezing by the time we left and sat wrapped up in my coat.The food was tasty though, and for \u00a36 each (Tastecard 50% off) I'd go back again.",

It looks elite even from the outside and as we enter a waitress kindly asks us to wait a couple of minutes for her to check if there are any available tables. The restaurant has two floors -there's plenty of room so we are shown to a table on the upper floor. Everything seems to be exquisite -the decor, the layout, the menu, the waiter, perfect compliment for a night out at a theatre or the opera. I'm not feeling out of the place with my elegant little black dress. The delicious, stone-baked pizzas are sorted -in continents -love the idea! You can find sortiments of Pizza Deluxe (Paris, Brittany, Queenstown), then there they come -Africa, Asia, Americas, Australia, Europe -with different cities included. Ingredients are well listed so you can make a decision where you want to taste-travel. I experimented with Casablanca and I was enjoying every bit of it. Impressive bar, they serve cocktails as well. Not the cheapest place to go to but once in a while each of us deserves a treat. Not to forget, they offer theatre deals -which inlcudes dinner & tickets to top West End Shows. Culture and cuisine -good match at any time!",

    "text": "I've been to this place 3 times now and have been more disappointed each time. The first time I went was ok, staff were a little disinterested but everything came and was nice. The second time I went we were waiting for a little while even though we'd booked a table, but were seated and everything seemed to be fine. However my companion's pizza arrived along with another one which wasn't the one I ordered, turned out the chef had read the ticket wrong, so it took about 20 mins for the correct one to be cooked. Fine, mistakes happen, however I was sitting with an empty glass and wasn't offered a drink or anything to be going on with. The main thing we noticed was that they don't push drink on you, so if you have an empty glass they won't ask if you'd like another drink or some water, and it's quite hard to catch the attention of waiting staff. So they took 10% off the final bill, however forgot to take the voucher we had off the bill so it took them a while to sort that out. The third time I went was a disaster, we arrived in time for our booking, we were told to wait up by the bar, so we did. While we were standing at the bar we were not offered a drink or even acknowledged by the plenty of bar staff who all seemed to be standing around not doing much. After a few minutes, a massive hoard of people descended on us so there were far too many people standing at the bar and it was starting to irritate some of the diners whose tables were close to the bar. We were approached by one of the hosts who asked us if we had a booking, so we said yes, in this name for this time, she looked as if she didn't believe us and said that she would have to go and check. So off she went. By this time it had got well past the time that we should have been seated so we stopped a waitress who was imensely rude, who said I'm not a host, I just work on the floor, I can't help you. We then asked if she could find someone who could and she didn't even respond to that, she just walked off. So we went and found one of the hosts who eventually seated us, we were left with a waiter who just wasn't interested, clearly didn't want to be there and wasn't bothered whether we enjoyed our meal or not. We finally got our meal a long time after we were seated, it had got so late and we'd been there for so long that I got half-way through my pizza and decided that I just couldn't be bothered any more. As per usual we weren't asked if we would like any more drinks. Nearby tables were not cleared and left with dirty crockery all over them. So we didn't leave a tip (even though they add an OPTIONAL 12.5% on before they total up the bill, WATCH OUT FOR THAT) and a waitress who hadn't dealt with us asked us why, and we told her. Hopefully our comments will be passed on Also they had a large party coming in so were moving tables with the maximum amount of fuss and noise and even asking diners if they would move It's a shame because the food is good, however the disinterested and frankly rude and disorganised waiting staff offer very poor value for money, in my opinion. I won't be going back unless I'm told by someone I trust that the staff have improved.",

Just around the corner from Covent Garden, it's a great way to eat close to the market without the spine chilling prices of those eateries.

However it was very hot and had a little too much chilli on it for my taste. Our waitress was very helpful and brought us tap water without a grimace ( unusual for London). The restaurant itself has quite a buzz, its light and clean, but a little noisy.All in all very good value ( even with the deal) as you can eat an main course with a glass of wine for just over \u00a310.

Great value for the covent garden area - they more often than not have discounted offers being diplayed outside or online. Large restaurant with an upstairs & downstairs dining areas. The queues to get in at night on weekends can be long & slow - even with a reservation! A number of times we've had to wait for our table to be available - despite arriving on time for the reservation. The pizza menu is large with a lot of choices on offer. Once seated have always found the waiting staff to be polite & attentive despite being so busy. Thumbs up - it's not fancy by any means but good value food in a nice enough environment all the same!",

The pizza I ordered had way too much sweet chilli sauce on it though which was disappointing. The service was ok - we didn't book and got a table quickly, but the room was incredibly noisy and we were unable to hear each other without yelling. Ok for a quick meal but I can make better pizza myself.",

We had a three course set menu for \u00a314.95 which I thought was fantastic value for money. Starter was breadsticks with dips and olives. I had the Canberra pizza which I thoroughly enjoyed. Dessert was ice-cream which was rich and refreshing. We had a fab night and I would definitely go back again when next in the area.",

I chose this one and I wasn't transported to North Africa - far too greasy and rich. The bases though are pretty good. However they must be doing something right as it was packed when we arrived.

They sometimes have other offers though the prices are still fairly reasonable even if you're paying full price. I like to think that their pizza is much better than those served at many of the chains, although they do have some unusual combinations named after large cities around the world. The restaurant looks very impressive because their extra tall ceilings make the dining room feel extremely large and open. Unfortunately the only downside is that sometimes a few of the tables are too close together and you end up overhearing other people's conversations.",

I've eaten here a few times - on a date, with a few friends and with a big group of people. Each time I've had nothing bad to say about the service. I wouldn't rave about it (they don't make any special effort to be friendly) but I haven't had a bad experience yet. The decor is hard to describe. Efficient maybe? It's modern, with lots of steel, but the soft lighting makes it quite comfortable and mellow somehow. Upstairs is definitely better than downstairs as the ceiling is a lot higher. and there seems to be more space between tables. And the pizzas are amazing. They range from quite simple through to basically a meal complete with potatoes on a pizza base. Every one I've tasted I have liked so far. And the two hour time slot? Who takes that long to eat a pizza?",

The service may be a little slow on occassion but hopefully this is a sign of the rapid success of the restaurant and they will get to grips with the huge demand soon, ideally by opening many more branches, with one next to my house preferably!",

    "text": "I would definitely not recommend this place for birthday parties. After my experience here, I would not recommend this place at all. The Covent Garden Fire and Stone has a decent menu, and is in a good location. However, the prices are not that cheap. You are essentially paying more for weird toppings, some of which sound good but don't taste good. Then everything you ask for is extra. Parmesan on your pizza? \u00a31 extra. Want to exchange a topping on a pizza for something else? You have to pay for the extra topping even if you are swapping say, duck for tomatoes. After a few of these issue came up, we starting to feel ripped off. The waiters constantly pushing for us to buy extras, or buy a more expensive wine, or bottled water instead of tap did not help at all. Then came the 'icing on the cake'. We had brought a birthday cake for our friend, and asked if they could light the candles and bring it out etc. They told us this was no problem, however there would be a \u00a33 charge per head to do this!! For our large group, this would have added about \u00a345 onto the bill. A restaurant more interested in getting maximum money out of tourists than keeping their customers happy. For the same money, you can do a lot better than this in Covent Garden. Avoid!",

The food was hot and served in a timely fashion, and it wasn't horrible - but not as good as expected, and not what I had hoped for. the service was a little brisk, although it was very busy with passing trade and pre-booked theatre offers.

Some of the toppings seem a bit out there for the less adventurous, but trust me, just dive in! The wine list is not extensive, but there's a decent enough choice. The ambiance is great here too - the place looks like the set of Sex and the City (try to go with 4/5 people as you can get a great booth!!) and there's a giant pizza oven at the front of the shop. Service is a little hit-and-miss, but everything else outweighs that. Do expect, however to be politely asked to finish up if you exceed the 2 hour limit - but hey, it keeps the cost down! Pricing is equivalent to another, more generic, pizza place on the high street - but that's where the comparison ends...",

It's usually pretty busy, and the ad-hoc booking arrangement when you get there is a little confusing (and has lost many customers to the adjacent GBK). Once you're in though, you'll learn the art of originality in the pizza medium. Whilst pizza joints using high-quality fresh ingredients aren't exactly hard to come by in London nowadays, few exhibit the raw creativity that Fire & Stone demonstrate. There's a real joy in ordering something which you don't normally find on a pizza, and is exactly why the Bombay (tandoori marinated chicken, yoghurt, broccoli, red onion, mango chutney, and so on), the Peking (hoi sin duck, cucumber, spring onions), Jakarta (satay chicken, aubergine, red chilli, tomato chutney) and Melbourne (brie, butternut, red onion, pumpkin seeds) are such amazing taste experiences. Personally I'd advise against the more traditional-looking pizzas, because you'll just find yourself silently cursing that you hadn't asked for the duck one after all. And also \u00a0buy the grilled bruschetta. Not negotiable.",

As with most restaurants, the markup on drinks is a little eye-watering, but the food is extremely competitively priced. The one unfortunate drawback is that it's regularly offered on the theatre and dinner deals favoured by websites such as lastminute.com, so getting a table without a reservation can be next to impossible at peak times. When the restaurant gets busy it's also pretty loud (although nothing compared to the cacophony of a Pizza Express).",

The best bit is that they have a permanent 'two pizzas for \u00a310' offer on; to get it you have to book in advance via the special offer section of its website.
