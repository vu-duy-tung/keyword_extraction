    "text": "This review is not for the main restaurant but for the little deli on the side that is known as The Counter at The Delaunay.The Counter at The Delaunay reminds me of an old 1920's style American cafe and serves take-out (or eat-in) \"simple\" foods where orders can cover hot bacon sandwiches, homemade granola, pretzels, and soup.Although I will say The Counter was very stylish with great attention to detail, \u00a0the hot dogs were severely overpriced and lacked any real flavour, the cheesecake (although very light and fluffy) was overly sweetened and they took my very simple order wrong. A great place to sit with a cup of tea, but as someone who loves sweets it is really saying something that I found it a bit much. And this is coming from someone who likes tea with their sugar. Should I come back, it will not be for the food. It will be simply to sit and read a book amongst a beautiful space.",

    "text": "Iwas lucky enough to have a friend take me to The Delaunay last Sunday.Aftera leisurely stroll from my home to the restaurant to clear our heads from arather late night the previous evening, we arrived invigorated and in the moodfor a good hearty brunch.I'dheard mixed reviews about this place but was confident that as it's from the samethoroughbred stable as The Wolseley we were in safe hands. Iwas right! From the off the charming oldgentlemen dressed in his smart green uniform hurried to open the large glassdoors and get us in from the cold. To your left was an attentive cloak room attendantand in front of you \u00a0a smiling and efficient front desk who quickly checkedour booking and whisked us off through this wonderful building to our table.Theroom was beautifully dramatic \u00a0reminiscent of a bygone age. I felt like I hadstepped into an exquisite silent film set on location in 1930's Paris!Thedark wood panelling, two tone tiled floor, table filled with glass cased cakesand mouth wateringly tempting treats echoed of a lost age of decadence and the crispwhite table clothes set with heavy silver cutlery and art deco sugar completedthe scene, even the napkins were made with an attention to detail not usually botheredwith by most. Wewere seated at a spacious table in a room that can perfectly place all so as toto enjoy the chatter and animation of others in the room \u00a0adding to the Frenchfeel of the place.This large open room is as much a visual feast as the menu is tothe taste buds, with choices to suit everyone from its comprehensive brunchmenu from Kedgeree, Black and White Pudding with duck Eggs ,Waffles with mapleSyrup or Bacon, Grilled Kippers and Mustard Butter, Salmon and Cream Cheese Bagel,There was an amazing array of choice of how to have eggs done as well as fishchoices and straight back to Paris with Croque Monsieur and Madame. There wasalso a very New York sounding section with Hot Dogs and Pretzels or you couldcarry on to dishes like the Panino of Grilled Chicken? I could go on and on the menu was really impressive, if you took someone along that could not findsomething they wanted \u00a0well I'd say give up \u00a0if they can't be pleased here thenthey are a lost cause! The promise to ourselves to not spoil our appetite with bread wasbroken immediately by the smell of the (I'd say rolls but they were shaped morelike strange cactus!) and we dug in and piled on the butter while we waited formy kippers with a side of grilled tomatoes and my friends waffles with maplesyrup to arrive along with a double shot espresso and juices. Delicious, delicious, delicious \u00a0the bread did not spoil our appetiteas the moment your food arrives your taste buds scream out for more! I loved it all, from the presentation of the heartshaped swirl in the coffee and the little glass of cold water to cool down yourhot drink if you wished to the cloudy apple juice and freshly squeezed orangeright through to the perfectly cooked kippers with the mustard butter thatbrought together flavours into one of my most delicious brunches ever! As we did not drink alcohol it was extremely reasonably priced \u00a0Thequick glimpse I took of the bill before it was sweetly taken from my hand was -Ithink \u00a347 which included service (which of course was discretionary) but I can'timagine anyone ever questioning the service as it was so attentive and charmingwithout being in the slightest bit intrusive. If you want to see pictures andon the spot quick reviews then do go to my twitter accounts @soraya72 or @FoodLovesLondonas their website dos not seem to have a gallery which is a great shame as you don'tget a sense of how beautiful the place is from it. Definitely a place to go for winter lunches and Brunches withclose friends",

Prices vary wildly. The sausages with accompaniments are very good value at about \u00a38. The Wiener schnitzel pricey at \u00a320 before adding the required side dishes. Desserts vary from patisserie items to wonderful ice-cream sundaes. A great place to slide in and enjoy a dish of something before heading out for the evening or perhaps a casual lunch. Not a great place for a three course traditional meal as the menu is rather disjointed.",

You can dress up in the evening with friends or go casual for lunch or a have a posh work breakfast (if expenses stretch). If you like the Wolseley, you will like this joint.

There was apparently a fire nearby, and it knocked out power to the restaurant. Disappointing, for sure, but we could have dealt with it fairly easily, if informed. However, The Delaunay didn't contact us to tell us of the closure, not a call (we have a European phone number), text or email. We found out by walking up to an obviously closed restaurant with a printed and laminated sign telling us that they were closed. There wasn't even someone from the restaurant there to tell us or direct us to other places to eat. I've worked at restaurants that had to close unexpectedly for the day, and I was there to man the phones and greet people and inform them of the closure. Really, you could even do that?

I like the space better than the Wolseley; it feels like it was born to be a restaurant whereas I sort of think the Wolseley feels a little like a repurposed bank. The menu is perfect for breakfast or lunch - I haven't been there for dinner but for me it's more of a fun, daylight kind of place. It's similar to Bob Bob Ricard but better because it's more lively. I loved the look and the menu at BBR, but it never seemed to have quite enough people. The Delaunay seems to be successfully full but not crowded, and it feels interesting without being pretentious. The whole sausage / hot dog section of the menu is cool. And I really like it that they give you a newspaper to read while you wait for the rest of your party to arrive. If you like the idea of taking a stroll into 1930s London definitely give it a whirl.",

Had the food been excellent, I would have swallowed the prices (\u00a37 for the salads I think, and about \u00a34 for the puddings) happily, but given the miserable offerings I was quite upset about the total bill of \u00a325.I won't be returning which is a real shame given the location and ambiance.",

We were also going to see Beautiful: The Carol King Musical that night so the location was perfect. When I made the reservation on line I had made a not that we were celebrating my mother's birthday hoping they might do something special, which they did, in the form of a cake for dessert that included a plaque saying \"happy birthday.But first, when we arrived I noticed the door man standing near the door. It was only after I opened the door for myself that he came over and held the door for the res of my party. We were seated promptly but waited maybe a good ten minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order. But once the server arrived we informed him we were ready to order everything he sent over his \"associate\" to take our order. The food was AMAZING! I had the sea bass which was excellent, perfectly cooked and a side of summer vegetable. My mother ordered the stroganoff which was to die for. She couldn't eat it all so I helped and it was by far the best beef stroganoff I've ever eaten. Our friend had the ribeye which she said was also very good. I ordered the truffles for dessert because we were all so full, and I thought maybe that would be served with a happy birthday message. But no, they gave my mom a complimentary piece of decadent chocolate cake. The truffles were sinfully good. It took about 5 minutes and 3 bites to get through one! That intense! The moment that really nailed it for us was when our friend spilled some b\u00e9arnaise sauce down the front of her shirt. The waiter noticed and without saying anything brought over an extra napkin and club soda in a bottle. A female server saw this and came over with a glass for the club soda and made a joke about men not knowing how to handle stains. It was a wonderful experience. Yes, it is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Excellent food and excellent service.",

After being seated, I ended up ordering the cream tea (I tried the Delaunay blend for my tea, and I'd recommend it as a pretty safe option), while my brother got a bagel with smoked salmon and an Americano (can you tell we're from New York?) and my mother had the Welsh rarebit. Everyone really enjoyed their choices; my mom the coffee-hater even had positive things to say when she tried my brother's Americano.Aside from the food, we enjoyed the general ambiance, and the service would have been wonderful if it had been just a bit less slow. It was also quite reasonably priced for the quality of the food and experience, and it's seemingly much easier to get a reservation here than at other places of similar caliber. Would recommend.",

There was definitely a case of the giggles when we reviewed the various menus - Crustacea, Shcnitzels, Weiners - thought the stunning ambiance, somewhat of a mix between an old worldly brasserie and a romanticised trans-Siberian train, made the whole experience feel very proper, though a somewhat unusual choice for such seemingly unrefined food.All the food was excellent, as were the drinks, and I would definitely be going back after an evening matin\u00e9e, or some musical in the area that I never end up seeing. If the restaurant was more in the likes of Mayfair, or Knightsbridge, I would much more likely frequent it regularly, as I don't find myself on the Stand too often, unfortunately I don't think I'll find myself back here anytime soon.",

The staff are all in crisp uniforms and the service is well-honed. \u00a0It looks like a good place to bring young children: we saw a few tables where the whole family had come out for Sunday brunch. It's a kind of high dining restaurant for the family.We were sitting at our table before our meals arrived and I thought to myself how relaxed and comfortable I was in that setting. \u00a0It would have been nice to have a slow coffee and chill out. \u00a0However, we were here for brunch. \u00a0We were told that our reservation gave us a two hour slot and I found this to be more than enough. \u00a0(Although, I usually don't really like it when you are given a time limit with your reservation.)We each got a marrochino which was a shot of espresso with a wafer of dark chocolate. \u00a0You drop the chocolate into the coffee, then stir to create a mini mocha of sorts. \u00a0At least, I hope that's what your supposed to do. \u00a0It was nice, but pretty small.I was in brunch mode, so I got the pancakes with bacon. My wife got the Arlington: a toasted English muffin with poached egg, salmon and hollandaise sauce. It looked very nice, and the muffin was toasted enough such that the toppings didn't make it soggy. \u00a0We shared a one of the cakes from the display near the entrance to finish. \u00a0My wife was raving about it. \u00a0Well done!They made a mistake with the bill, including something that we hadn't ordered. \u00a0But this was quickly cleared up without fuss. \u00a0They also have a cover charge of \u00a32 per person (I think to cover the free bread which they give you at the start). \u00a0I also usually don't like this, but I won't let it dampen my review of an otherwise good experience.",

True enough, this place is indeed classy - loved the interior, and the atmosphere was was lovely. We went on a weekday morning so most people there were people doing srs bizness - it was amusing cos for a period of time we were the youngest people in the restaurant and it was rather awkward because it made us seem either we were a) unemployed or b) rich kids with a lot of daddy's money to spend.The breakfast is definitely on the pricey side - we ordered an All English breakfast to share with a mini-pastry basket. I ordered a regular macchiato (that came in a super-tiny cup - the waitress did warn me but i didn't know it was THAT small ) and my friend ordered her usual mocha. The food met expectations - nothing really spectacular on that side. I felt that my money mostly went into the interior, the cutlery, the service and the experience. If I had more moolah I'd definitely go back again but this time to their pastry section because the pastry looked amaaaazing - so sad I didn't get to try them all. \u00a0One day. When I have more money. Till then, Delaunay!",

Anyway, there were hardly any other people there at around 9 pm so there were plenty of seats available. I ended up ordering a pot of green tea, which came out within 5 minutes in a cool-looking teapot. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the actual tea. It just tasted bitter, without much of the flavor that green tea is supposed to give. Even though the price was relatively low - 2.15 pounds - I probably wouldn't get the tea here a second time.",

The restaurant is lovely, as is the service and presentation. I expected more from the food. The cordon bleu (I thought it was odd that it was listed with the schnitzel, but I guess it is breaded meat) was good. All of the flavors were there and the sauce did not cover everything up, nor did it need to. The choucroute a l'Alsaciene (german sausage, french title) is a variety of the sausage (a huge portion of sausage) with a large portion of sauerkraut (too much) and a couple of potatoes thrown in. This is enough for at least a couple of people who are really into their meat, but not so much the potatoes. The sausage was good, and it was very rich, It was more of a standard good, not outstanding good. The beef stroganoff was better, the sauce had a good flavor.",

The torte of the day was simply amazing. Unfortunately, I dug into it before I could get a picture. It was a heavy cream cake with perfect pie crust and a small bit of (real?) gold leaf on top. It was the best pastry of our trip. Service was a bit on the slow side, considering that they weren't busy.",

We booked with top table for us and 2 friend who were local. They had never been to the Delaunay.  \u00a0 Even with the reservation they struggled to find a place for us. Finally, we were given a tiny table that half jutted in the foyer and half into the dining room. The table was so small we struggled to find places for our tea and coffee. I eagerly order the pasty basket 8.50 which was a hit on the last visit. Well, this year it was so small, not even two of us were able to share it.  \u00a0 We sat for a long time, finally hailing down passing servers to place our order, get water. Every need was a begging request. We were never greeted, I am not sure we had the same person twice.  \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, the entrees were just as good as last year but the experience was terrible and embarrassing. We conveyed our disappointment to the host on the way out were told \"Oh really, so sorry... bye.\"  \u00a0 I think they Delaunay is unfortunately becoming a victim of it's own success.",

I ordered:Rib-eye Steak and fries - the steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare. it was juicy and delicious. the fries were also good but nothing out of this world.But the best thing I got to taste was a bite of the Fillet of Sea Bass. It was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and fresh. Soft while not mushy. It was unreal. So, my recommendation is if your in London and fancy an upscale meal....head to Delaunay and order the sea bass. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My second time here was slightly disappointing -- not on the food end, but more on efficient service! I had a flat white and a cheese/tomato croissant in-restaurant (highly recommend the croissant -- I had it toasted and can't talk about it enough! Reasonably priced for something of that quality in prime real estate in an expensive city). However, I came in and was told I could sit anywhere to be served -- perfectly fine. I wanted to sit outside and knew that there was a risk I'd be overlooked or ignored (they do have busy outside seating but I'd come a bit earlier than the outdoorsy rush typically sat outside). It took me a rather long time of staring intently over my shoulder through the cafe window to flag down a waiter to take my order (which I'd made up the instant I walked in). Then, a different waiter brought out my flat white at last, but had a moment of carelessness in which my drink was roughly plopped on the table (I acknowledge it may have been an accident, but that's still not good for business) and the flat white spilled, with some liquid seeping into my textbook....After a brief moment of awkwardness, the waiter realized the proper thing to do was to remake the flat white -- in the same soiled cup. I don't normally care, but I'd expected more from such a fancy and well-known establishment, I guess! Still, the waiters were relatively friendly and attentive after that -- so same rating! But perhaps a word to the wise: sit inside or explicitly tell the staff you'll be outside.",

    "text": "I was told by good friends who used to live in London to try breakfast at the Wolseley \u00a0--it is a must! \u00a0I was swayed by a foodie relative to instead try their new sister restaurant which had just opened to rave reviews, the Delaunay. \u00a0The space is uber fancy, beautiful, in the style of an old European cafe with well-turned out waitstaff throughout the restaurant, white table clothes, old world dark woods, white tile floors, white tablecloths, elaborate place settings, and a beautiful oak bar. \u00a0There is a cafe with buffet style foods next to a formal restaurant. \u00a0We ate in the restaurant.We walked in for an 11:30 breakfast without a reservation on a Thursday, and were promptly seated in a half-empty dining room. \u00a0The dining room was stylish and traditional: it was gorgeous in an old-school (but modern) London way.To be honest, it was a shocking poor service experience. \u00a0There were almost 20 waitstaff, and they all looked exceedingly dapper, but we were surprised to find they paid more attention to promptly decorating empty tables in elaborate settings than servicing the very few (time of day) customers in their establishment. \u00a0We had multiple servers, but never the same person, so they seemed to forget who we were and what we needed. For instance, our crumpets arrived without butter or jam, and as they cooled on the table we tried to flag someone, anyone down. \u00a0 By the time they cooled, the butter had finally arrived and then we asked for jam, and were told it was not included: they would have to charge extra. \u00a0Did we still want it? \u00a0 Um, yes! \u00a0All I could think is why were we finding this out now: why had no one thought to ask if we wanted butter and jam when we ordered crumpets 15 minutes before?We ordered tap water later to find out later, when we asked, that it was filtered and we'd be charged 1.5 pounds for it, but (lucky us!) it'd be refilled for free throughout the meal. \u00a0Gosh, not that that's a big deal really, but being charged extra for things like water and jam, and well, you start to feel like the hospitality factor is somewhat lacking.The lattes and coffee we ordered were strong, tasty, and served beautifully. \u00a0There is even a tiny cup of water (to wash your spoon in? Fancy!) and a chocolate to enjoy with it. \u00a0Here, things were generous (as long as we weren't charged extra for that lovely chocolate, because I'm starting to wonder...)The meals our party had were all good: waffles with bacon, kedgeree (my first time, but the curry was NOT subtle making it hard to taste the smoked fish), and an order of pancakes. \u00a0All were solid offerings.There seems to be a market in London for a place that does a good breakfast, but even more of a market here for an overly fancy place. \u00a0By the feel of the place, should be five stars. \u00a0But its not: you don't ever feel comfortable here or well looked after. \u00a0I think if they can figure out a way to not charge \"convenience fees\" for things like jam or water, and just roll it into the price, we'd have felt like we were having a better experience, overall.(I must give credit that by end of the meal we did have a full apology from the captain of the dining room, along with a break on the bill. \u00a0This was a nice gesture and certainly appreciated.)",

    "text": "This place didn't blow me away but served its purpose - which was to go for a nice Friday brunch with the girls on the morning of our best friend's wedding reception (helpfully leaving said friend by herself to do any final prep - woops). As sister to The Wolseley, it has that same 1930s-Europe-inspired grand brasserie feel - think marble flooring, white linen tablecloths and smartly aproned waiters. You definitely feel like you're somewhere a bit swish, so it was nice to find that the breakfast prices are still pretty reasonable for such a setting.We arrived deliberately just in time to order from the breakfast menu (served til 11.30am on weekdays btw, so max out that lie-in!) feeling like we were bunking off school as we'd all taken the day off work. There's a good amount of choice and my Potato Rosti with Fried Egg for \u00a35 was really filling (you get 2 eggs). Think I was happier than my friend who chose Eggs Florentine and got half the food for twice the price. We always do the 'double brunch' as standard though, following everyone's first round with 2 orders of pancakes to share between 5 of us (defo go for the blueberries and cr\u00e8me fraiche stack). The Tropical Fruit smoothie also gets my recommendation, and if anyone else out there has a strange love of unusual kitchenware (err yep, that would be me) you'll enjoy using the tea strainers ;)The service could've been a bit warmer; the woman on the door looked quite unimpressed but then we did load her up with a lot of dress bags to put in the cloakroom. Otherwise the service was civil if a little slow given we'd hit the late morning lull between peak breakfast time and lunch. This also meant we were making most of the noise in the place for a good part of the meal (not surprising for us) so wonder if there's more of a buzz at busier times.The food didn't stand out enough to rush back, but for a weekday girly brunch it did just fine.",

The service was very hospitable, and we liked the atmosphere, despite the oppressive heat of another mid-80s day.We had Stiegl beers, which were cold, and the fondue to start. The fondue was delicious, with cauliflower and toasted bread bits. The cheese was gruyere, but lacked brandy, and had a ring of butter around the edge signaling that it could have been hotter. Still tasty.Wife and I each had the schnitzel and potato salad. She is German, and we've eaten a lot of this stuff, in Germany, Leavenworth WA, Austria, and at home. We agreed that this schnitzel was just okay. The meat was nicely cooked, the perfect thickness, and had no gristle. The breading, however, reminded us of cheap fish and chips. It lacked dimension in both flavor and feel. It was simply breadcrumbs--bland. But the potato salad is where they really dropped the ball. It was nice small potatoes, cut in half, and covered in--special sauce! It was the french fry sauce served in countless small town burger joints throughout North America! So, if you expect the cucumbery vinegar and onion tang of what we call \"German potato salad\" you will be out of luck.Still, for fair prices and great service, you could do worse.",

    "text": "We were visiting London to see my brother who was studying abroad there. Since he had not done the \"Afternoon Tea\" experience, my research took me here to the Delaunay.Yes, this place is certainly upscale. It is \"pink up\" fancy. I almost felt a bit out of place but I knew what to expect as I have done other afternoon tea type experiences. For 20 or so pounds, I think you get a pretty good tea experience. What it includes is a tea selection/tea pot for each individual as well as a selection of sweet and savories such as little canapes, scones, etc. I thought I would love the savories a bit more but they left something to be desired. The sweets were quite good and came with whipped cream. The scones came warm came with a clotted cream and jelly which were quite good. Waiters were attentive and brought refills of hot water for the tea pots.There were two nut allergies that we advised the waiters on. They sent a manager to personally speak with us about the accommodations they were making to prevent giving us anything with nuts. While this was a great experience, there was some confusion when the sweet and savories came to the table, the waiter mentioned pistachios on some of the desserts to which I had again reminded his that pistachios were nuts...The waiter left to go get the manager leaving us with the food that we were afraid to start on until we had more clarification. There was quite an awkward lull/wait until the manage came to explain that the \"pistachio\" items were actually \"mint cream\" but did not outwardly recognize that he had misspoken or made a mistake when explaining what was on the trays. This was a small hiccup but it did make my brother a bit nervous as he was the one with the severe nut allergy. Everything was fine though as he tried every item and did not have any reactions to the selections. A few others around us were having afternoon teas as well as others were having either late lunch or early dinners. It was a fun and different kind of experience but I think I would try another spot next time I am in London.",

We got the Salzburg souffl\u00e9, impressive and an experience, but it does just taste like apricot egg air. We also got the banana split. Which was disappointing. The chocolate sauce was super rich and over powered everything. You go for the experience more than anything.",

I ordered the Fried Duck Egg (8/10, tasty and on the slightly above average heavy side) and a Green Smoothie (Didn't taste good but did the job of \"refreshing\" me haha). My friends ordered Eggs Florentine, Eggs Benedict and Steak Tartare (They liked their dishes). The ambiance of this place is conducive to a casual conversation, even while the place is large and usually decently packed. Great solid brunch place. Definitely would return!",

As with its sister restaurant the Wolseley the highlight of the delaunay is the atmosphere. You do feel transported to a bustling day in Vienna. It is such a great mix of high quality yet relaxed. The food and the service are both fantastic. I enjoyed the pancakes for brunch and had an excellent flat white - a 7 out of 10 on the coffee front. This really is a restaurant for every meal. And the location is also great - we did brunch here before heading over to Somerset house.",

I had such wonderful Irish oysters as a starter that I ordered a second round . My main was the veal schnitzel and was perfectly crisp with lemon on side and a darker sauce on the side that was subtle but delicious . And then banana split to share for dessert . Our waiter Michele from Italy was attentive and a pleasure to interact with. I will be sure to visit again on any subsequent trips to London .",

I liked several items on the menu and couldn't decide so I asked the waiter for suggestions and he mentioned that the Stroganoff was one of their specialties. (and it was one of the things I was considering) It was wonderful! So tasty! The service was also very pleasant. I also liked the dark wood cozy atmosphere and I felt the prices were reasonable. Very convenient if you're going to the theater, too.",

This takes you back to a warm traditional interior. The food is good and the fresh juice of the day was excellent. Ordered the Arnold omelet. It was unique bc never had it before, but it was a bit mushy and wet in the inside for me. I poured a lot of tabasco bc there wasn't much of a flavor and taste to it. But it was still lovely! Would recommend this place. You are given a specific amount of time to dine, but after eating, I suggest to go to the cafe connected next door for some coffee and or dessert.",

    "text": "Ever walked in to a restaurant and felt totally under dressed? Well, I'm not I'll ever feel properly dressed for The Delaunay!Situated close to Temple station, the grand entrance of The Delaunay will make anyone feel like a superstar. Our bags were swiftly taken by someone in exchange for a small numbered token, and we were taken to our table. We had reserved as we were a table of six, but there were plenty of other large tables around, so they were very accommodating. Service is done in a very traditional manner, with an individual of the team taking each section of the order and then delivering it. Our drinks order was taken quickly, then presented a little while later - a slight delay, but probably due to the cappuccinos taking longer to make, and their desire to ensure everything arrives at the same time.I had a pot of breakfast tea, served with a small tea strainer; the novelty of having 'proper tea' was initially slightly lost on me, though I enjoyed the theatrical nature of having a little implement to strain the tea leaves. The menu is larger than expected, though we were focused purely on the breakfast/brunch section. They appear to be known for their eggs benedict, which many of our party went for, but I opted for the pancakes with blueberries and creme fraiche. They were served in a perfect stack, with a layer of blueberry compote between each individual pancake; pancakes come in many forms, and these were some of the best I have had. The aforementioned layer of compote meant I didn't have to experience that slightly dry final few mouthfuls of many previous meals elsewhere, and there was enough creme fraiche to last for the whole stack. I was also presented with my own little jug of maple syrup.As a final flourish, my ever adorable parents (yes, that's you mum!) had mentioned my upcoming birthday, so I was delivered a little plate of lovely morsels upon the bill arriving. Strawberry and lemon homemade marshmallows were zingy and fluffy, and turkish delight - mum's favourite! - went down with a smile.A real treat for when you're looking for something really special.",
