    "text": "I had the pancake with caramelized bananas and bacon a few weeks ago. The pancake was fantastically fluffy (nothing earth shattering, however), the bananas were spectacular, but the bacon left much to be desired. It should be an international crime to mess up bacon. They advertised it as \"crispy,\" and it very much met that description... so much that it was overcooked and ended up overpowering the rest of the dish! GET IT TOGETHER, THE TABLE, BECAUSE BACON IS IMPORTANT.Bacon philosophy aside, let's move on. Ambiance was nice. Well lit space with bench-style seating, which made for an enjoyably communal experience. Service was just OK. Smoothies were about 8-10oz... a waste of money @ \u00a35 (this seems to be the status quo in London, unfortunately). All in all I love brunch and mostly enjoyed my meal, so I will definitely return the next time I visit.",

It's a very inviting atmosphere- so clean and simple!Service: Veryy nice people yayy!Food:- Eggs Florentine: If you've read my reviews before, I'm a picky Eggs Florentine eater because I like/hope/strive for that PERFECTLY poached egg. Well, both of mine were a tad overcooked (yolk was runny, but not explosively runny), but the dish was simple and fresh.- My friend got the Eggs Royale and her eggs were actually done quite nicely!! So I guess i was a hit or miss.- Another friend got the toast with eggs. Biggest portion of all three dishes!The tea also comes in a giant teapot thing that was really cool.I don't remember how much I paid exactly, but I do remember that it was an amount that I didn't think was of the greatest value. I wished there was a side or maybe something extra? But I guess you pay extra for the different decorBottom Line: Just a teensy less than for the value of what you pay, but it is definitely a very comfortable place to have some breakfast!",

No. \u00a0Not particularly.I got a smoked salmon bagel, and I was expecting it to arrive warm. \u00a0I was wrong. \u00a0It arrived cold. \u00a0I ate it all. \u00a0And it was pretty tasty, all things considered. \u00a0But it just didn't excite me. \u00a0I also got an americano, which was made with Monmouth espresso blend beans, and it was a perfectly serviceable cup of coffee but nothing that blew me away.I looked around me at my fellow diners' plates and got a bit of plate envy. \u00a0Maybe I should have just got the \u00a34 scrambled eggs on toast. \u00a0Maybe I should have got the eggs benedict. \u00a0Maybe I should have just got the muesli buffet. \u00a0I know I shouldn't have got the buttermilk pancakes, though, because what arrived at the table was a big flat pancake looking very sad with bacon nestled on top of it on a plate. \u00a0My American mind thinks \"FLUFFY PANCAKES YUM!\" when it reads \"buttermilk pancakes\", and perhaps that's my own fault. \u00a0At least there's that. \u00a0I enjoyed my slightly sweet, albeit cold, bagel with cream cheese and chilled smoked salmon more than I would have the pancakes.All this being said, if one of my friends said to me, \"Larissa, let's meet at the Table for brunch this weekend\", I'd say, \"Okay!\"So, yeah. I liked it enough.And all the baked goods on display looked divine. \u00a0I didn't realise that everything served at the Table is made in house, so I assumed (wrongly) that they were bought in from local bakeries, which is why I didn't gluttonously order one after I finished my breakfast. \u00a0Perhaps on my next visit I'll just eat pastries and drink coffee. \u00a0Because I prefer cake to real food.As any normal person does, obviously.",

    "text": "Oh sweet pretension. We had breakfast here on a Friday morning before hitting a market. \u00a0We made a reservation, though it wasn't necessary. \u00a0A bit oddly, although there were only two other people eating in the restaurant, they sat us right next to them, as opposed to a table for four. \u00a0Is this part of the 'experience' of the namesake? \u00a0I don't know, but it was a little weird.We ordered a Full English, the breakfast brushetta and french toast.The Full English was average- nothing really special, nothing disappointing. They were out of the french toast so we had blueberry waffles instead- which was just a waffle with a cup of blueberries on the side and pre-poured syrup. \u00a0Kind of dry and plain.The breakfast brushetta came with (flaccid, undercooked) bacon I hadn't ordered (it's an optional add-on) and it took an extremely long time to be remade considering we were the only ones eating in the joint. The finished product was pretty tasty, though, if extremely simple (avocado and tomato slices on toast with two poached eggs). Waitress left in the middle of our meal without telling us, or apparently, anyone else. \u00a0We wanted take-away coffees, but by the time we got someone'e attention, we were just ready for the bill. \u00a0They charged me for the bacon I didn't order, but at that point I was just ready to get out and didn't bother correcting it. The opening comment is a result of the stereo system that have installed by the wall and the fact that they were playing Abercrombie & Fitch-style shit-tastic techno, extremely loudly, at 9:30 in the morning. \u00a0WTF? \u00a0We asked if they could turn it down a bit (only people in the restaurant) and they pretended to and went on with their business. \u00a0I know, I get it--- one of my least favorite things as a waitress is when one customer in the whole damned restaurant tells me I need to adjust the temperature or the music volume. \u00a0But seriously- 9:30? Techno? Empty restaurant? \u00a0Gross.Overall, a bit awkward and disappointing, and I was more than a little bit embarrassed to have recommended this place to my visitors.",

Or maybe yes, so it's not crowded when I have to go! ;)DISHESI'm probably addicted to their \"Table Stack\", a great mix with beans, chorizo, ham on bagel and two poached eggs. It's a great mix and probably will also give you enough energy for the whole weekend.The coffee, and particularly the cappuccino, is not a good italian one, but it's quite good nonetheless.AMBIENT AND SERVICEThe ambient is excellent, with a very bright room and wooden tables, overall a very well crafted room. Most of the tables have a bench, no chairs, so mind that if you think you'll be uncomfortable.The service is excellent, very careful but also very quiet and not intrusive at all. They have also some tables outside in the rear of the place, it's on a road but it's a closed one, so you don't have any trouble caused by the traffic.I always tried this place for brunch, but given the quality of it it's probably also a great choice for lunch and dinner as well.",

    "text": "Brunch. That perfect meal after a lie-in on the weekend when you wake ravenous for breakfast foods but realise it's time for lunch. (Or in my case this past Saturday, the well earned reward for 3 hours of cycling and fitness training...I think the lazy way is preferable though...). The Table Caf\u00e9 puts on a good spread at reasonable prices and doesn't fill up until mid afternoon.Based off the Telegraph's list of top picks for brunch in London, Tracy L and I decided to work our way down the list with The Table Caf\u00e9 in Southwark being our first stop. \u00a0The recommended dishes were the Table Stack (a toasted bagel with chorizo and poached eggs absolutely smothered in baked beans and a bit of hollandaise on the top) and the Sweetcorn Fritters with tomato compote. I'll give it to the Telegraph reviewers, both dishes were tasty and on the unique side of the menu. You can also get your usual range of pancakes and waffles with a wide variety of toppings as well as the Eggs series but that's standard for pretty much any brunch spot.The Table stack was fairly easy to eat with fork and knife (my biggest concern) largely due to the choice of bagel as the bread rather than a more standard bit of toast or English muffin. The elastic nature of the bagel allowed it to hold together and absorb considerably more sauce than it's carb counterparts. I have to note that the chorizo failed to make an appearance unless it was somehow blended into the beans. I would have like the spicy counter note to the rich creaminess of the eggs, sauce, and beans. Still, all in all, a good dish.The sweetcorn fritters were delicious. I'm a sucker for sweetcorn (and probably slightly biased) and these fritters were packed with juicy kernels exploding with sweet flavours. The fitter was golden brown and fried to a crispiness on the outside while maintaining a fluffy light texture on the inside. The tomato compote was full of umami and provided a great degree of acidity to enhance the sweetness of the corn.Dessert was had in the form of the Chockywockydoodah waffle which comes drenched in syrup, chocolate sauce, and marshmellows. All that needs to be said is that for two die hard deserters such as me and Tracy L, the waffle satisfied our sweet teeth without a problem and was decadent to the point where we couldn't finish. That never happens. Ever.Overall, a good experience despite a bit of a mix up on my smoothie (I order a mango and pineapple smoothie and it came out green as someone had added spinach) the customer service was spot on. Pricewise, our meal ran around \u00a350-60 for the two of us including a drink but dishes are prices around \u00a310-15 each so by all means an affordable option.",

We found this restaurant close to our hotel (near Blackfriars) thanks to Yelp and boy am I glad that we did, because it turned into a morning ritual for us.It's a very nice and clean restaurant with a very friendly staff. \u00a0That right there was good enough in my books for three to four stars, but then add the quality of the breakfast food, BAM! Up to five, with one exception.I can't say it enough, the eggs benedict, along with a shared side of either one of their delicious pancakes or waffles were just simply, AMAZING. \u00a0Add their freshly brewed coffee to that, and it's game over. \u00a0It's not to often than I am completely satisfied in all aspects at a restaurant, but The Table is honestly just that damn good. \u00a0The only negative aspect in my opinion is the table layouts when the place is busy (which is often). \u00a0In retrospect, we should've just made reservations each morning but didn't. \u00a0The tables are all connected horizontally with benches on each side that sit two people. \u00a0I wasn't a fan of sharing a bench with a stranger, but oh well.Next time we return to London, we will definitely be coming here.",

With a one-day stopover in London and a plan to mosey from Westminster to the Tate we ended up starving on Southwark and turned to Yelp for help, which led us here, and it was just what we needed.

Overall: I don't know what else I can possibly add to the super concise summary above not to mention milliards of reviews from dedicated and well-informed yelpers on this page. Oh, did I say this place is great? I probably have...The food at The Table Caf\u00e9 is without a doubt of top quality among restaurants that serve brunch/ breakfast. It is also a very stylish caf\u00e9 with modern wooden furniture and bare concrete that make this place look like a gallery of a modern artist. The large windows bring in a lot of natural light into the large open space. The caf\u00e9 serves famous brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. There is usually a queue outside but I have never waited for more than 5 minutes. Sometimes you have to share a long table with other people. (Majority of tables are long ones.) I have tried eggs dishes, pancakes and waffles so far and I can tell you they are all good. Oh, the eggs. So soft and tender. Before the perfect hollandaise sauce I surrender. Wait, I just rhymed there! It's so good that it makes me want to pull of some haiku although I have no idea how. My only trouble is that the portion is not so big here. And I eat a lot. So sometimes I have to get an egg dish AND a pancake (or a waffle) to fill me up. I have also been here for a party of a friend (the caf\u00e9 also does event hire) and the food there was lovely too. I haven't had lunch or dinner but I'm sure they are good too.",

However, other items on the menu were thoroughly disappointing. \u00a0I had their burger and french toast and I would give both 2 stars. \u00a0Burger - It was completely overcooked and bone dry. \u00a0At midpoint it was just grey grey grey. \u00a0I don't know what percent mince they use but they may need to up the fat content because even towards the end I was experiencing zero drippage. \u00a0Fail. \u00a0Their brioche was stale, dry, and rough with no bite at all. \u00a0It tasted like they were feeding me gluten free bread but without the benefits of it actually being gluten free. \u00a0The pickled onions completely overpowered my palate and I couldn't taste my meager ration of sauce or cheese. \u00a0Bacon was pretty good though. \u00a0The flavors may have blended better had the meat been more juicy, but at this execution nothing came together. \u00a0Granted I came in at a later time so it may have been an off cook, but at 18 pounds for a coffee and burger I find this inexcusable. French toast - I'm not sure but I think they use the same rough brioche that they use in their burgers (?) They make a good attempt at flavor with a healthy dose of cinnamon and tart yogurt, but because of their low ball brioche game the texture is all wrong. \u00a0Manages to be rough and dry yet soggy at the same time with none of the custardy yumness of a good french toast. This place is a one trick pony that does awesome pancakes but the off item are bad enough I don't have the courage to order anything else.... A very volatile 3 star average.",

Prices were very reasonable for food, slightly pricey for coffee and drinks.What was amazing value were the extra off menu side dishes. We ordered extra mushrooms and scrambled eggs.

And not just during traditional breakfast/brunch hours either since they offer an all day every day breakfast menu. Legit breakfast for dinner? Score! Before you get too excited, you can only take advantage of breakfast for dinner on weekdays since they're only open for brunch on weekends (til 4:30pm). Came here for Sunday brunch at 1pm. Sunny and inviting space a few blocks from Southwark tube station. Didn't have to wait for a table, which was good because they don't have a bar area you can wait at.They know how to do pancakes - massive, fluffy, fresh, warm, moist and decadent. I had the buttermilk pancake topped with crispy bacon, caramelised banana and Canadian maple syrup. Crispy bacon is hard to find round these parts so that sealed the deal for me. Haven't found better pancakes or bacon yet in London (granted, I've only been here a month)A downside to this spot is that they run out of certain items on the menu (both of our first choice options were no longer available) so you may be disappointed if you had your heart set on something specific.",

The reason I am giving a 1 star review is because I have recently moved here from New York and one thing that I don't appreciate is restaurants advertising that they are open until a certain time (in this case 22:30) and being close much earlier then that. We waked a fair amount to get here and it just seems that this might be the norm but I want to let others know that they do not stay open until their advertised times. For this I doubt I will try the food as I don't want to waste my time for a place that might not be open when we get there.",

There was a long wait to get a table and for service, not because there were alot of people, but because the servers were just inattentive, slow and rude. Im surprised by the high ratings. The food was just okay. Find somewhere else if you can. Oh and we saw the busyboy argue with guests at three different tables while we were there. Not very professional.

Good work, Jamie, because this turned out to be a rather smashing place to get a hearty breakfast full of fresh local ingredients. Despite the mostly communal-table set-up, we managed a space for ourselves which probably gave us subconscious self-approval to order more food than we deserved. But hey, we were on vacation, and the only thing we planned that entire day was riding the London Eye. After all, it takes a lot of energy standing in those bubble cars for a half-hour while it rotates.So many temptations. Jamie went for the \u00a3 12.00 Borough Full English Breakfast, a hearty new-jack take on the traditional plate with two fried eggs on toast, bacon, pork-and-leek sausage, slow-cooked baked beans, grilled tomato, and herb mushrooms (photo: bit.ly/1l0nZbf). Quite a smorgasbord with each item quite delicious. As a chaser, he also went for the steamy-good \u00a3 3.90 Hot-Toasted Croissant with Gruyere and Sliced Tomato (photo: bit.ly/1hGy8Mj). What's not to like about butter, cheese and tomato banding together for the sole purpose of edible enthrallment? I ordered the \u00a3 9.00 Breakfast Bruschetta (photo: bit.ly/1nnGp7i).Sliced plum tomatoes, avocado, two poached eggs, some chopped basil with olive oil, and \"grilled streaky bacon\" were piled precariously on a grilled wedge of sourdough. It really hit the spot, and it could have been enough on a more less belly-inflated day. But no, I was lured by the sight of the \u00a3 7.00 Hot-Iron Waffle with Blueberries and Cream (photo: bit.ly/1iQXpPc). That was for me. Believe it or not, it was incredibly light like it was flash-fried in the iron and dolloped with the cream to cool it down. What a satisfying meal to start a spontaneous day traipsing London. If we were full-time Brits, we would surely be back because Bob's your uncle, mate.FOOD - 4 stars...first-rate breakfast fare really hits the spotAMBIANCE - 4 stars...clean, modern space befitting the trendy neighborhoodSERVICE - 3.5 stars...effective though a tad coolish, a bit clippedTOTAL - 4 stars...probably one of the better bets for breakfast in London",

Brunch is my favourite genre of food, and I can confidently say that The Table wins best eggs benedict that I've had in the UK, AND best coffee I've had since moving to London from NZ. The eggs, perfectly caramel in texture. The hollandaise moist and zingy. The bacon lay across the tender muffins like the goddess it is, all crispy and nonchalant. My partner's corn fitters were little parcels of joy, collaborated with a bunch of deliciousness. Service was quick, fast and efficient, and as busy as it was we were well looked after so don't be put off by the thought of having to wait - these guys know exactly what they're doing!",

I was not disappointed. Food presentation was very nice for a casual restaurant. Though the sausage and eggs were nothing extraordinary, the beans in tomato sauce were the best beans I've ever had!! The dish also came with the best mushroom I've ever had; it was big and juicy (sorry no elegant way of putting that). The tea was also impressive. It's actually because of this experience that I now prefer Earl Grey and ordered it wherever I went for the rest of my trip. I also loved the clean, modern, and slightly hipster decor of the place. Service was great, and they took our American credit card without any problems. Though we weren't the only Americans dining there, this place is not really touristy. And you can definitely find cheaper breakfast elsewhere, but they're often cash only.",

    "text": "Really well done breakfast at The Table. I ordered the Full English and enjoyed their upscale interpretation of the original. All components of the dish were well conceived and well executed. I particularly liked the garlicky sausage (huge, the size of a bratwurst), the portobello with pesto, and the chipotle beans. Don't let the unique-sounding combination scare you off, it all worked wonderfully and I'd order it again. Also very well done was the cappuccino.The rest of the breakfast menu looked great. I admired the plates of all of my neighbors especially the avocado toast and eggs Benedict. The atmosphere at The Table has a neighborhood feel. There were a mix of families, business folks, friends, and a sprinkling of tourist such as myself.I'd like to give the Table 5 stars but there were two imperfections that must be taken into account. I think that my Full English breakfast was supposed to come with bacon, it did not. To be fair, due to the large portion of food, I didn't need any more and didn't ask about it. So, there wasn't a chance for them to clarify or fix it. Also, the service was a little on the cold side, not particularly welcoming. With that said, I will return the next time I'm in London.",

The banana,walnut pancake was just ok - nothing special. What was a little annoying was that the manager refused to give us cappuccino's instead of the espresso shot on yelp checkin. The espresso was \u00a32.70 and the cappuccino was \u00a33. We told her to charge us the difference and give us a cappuccino to which she said no. I thought it was a small adjustment to ask for especially when we offered to pay the difference!",

    "text": "I've wanted to try brunch at The Table for a LONG time, so when the opportunity presented itself I was up and out with a spring in my step! We arrived just before 10.30, and only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table. It didn't take long for a queue to start forming behind us though, so I would suggest getting there before 10.30 if you can.We were greeted by a hip young man with a ridiculous moustache, who was only averagely polite. Once we were seated we had a great waitress who was fast and efficient, and we found the service to be like this throughout our visit. They certainly seemed to know what they were doing! The interior is very simple, nothing to write home about, and it was quite busy/noisy but that was to be expected. They draw a crowd for a reason. The coffees were good, but not quite as strong as I would have liked. However, my friend's tea came in an ENORMOUS tall pot, and seemed almost endless! She was very happy indeed. The food itself was pretty much flawless. I went for The Stack, the Jason Statham of brunches. How could I not? Beans mixed with chorizo and ham hock, layered between two halves of a muffin and topped with two velvety, perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It was amazing. Super delicious, well considered and only a tiny bit too big so I didn't feel too stuffed all day... The beans could have done with being just a touch saucier, and there could have been a slightly more generous dollop of hollandaise, but those little niggles aside, it was perfection. My friends had the full English and eggs florentine, and were both very pleased. The prices were fair. My stack was \u00a311, the eggs were around \u00a38-\u00a39, which is all very standard for good brunch spots in London, and this is one of the tastiest. My only negative comment would be to suggest that if a table is going to be placed right in front of the drinks fridges then they should have doors on and not be open, it was just a little bit chilly in our seats! Overall, I left very content, as did my friends, and I would certainly go back if I had cause to be in the area again. If I'm staying North though, I'll stick to the Shoe Shop...",

    "text": "My 100th review!!! \u00a0I had to think long and hard on what to review to mark this occasion. It had to be pretty damn special, and The Table wins the spotlight for a number of reasons. 1. In July 2013, Yelp hosted an epic event: Yelp's Key to the Bankside, where 13 keys were hidden around southbank, with a chance to win a trip to Amsterdam. \u00a0I found a key there, and won a generous champagne brunch for 4 at The Table (along with a tour of the garden where their fresh herbs and vegetables are sourced from). \u00a0This was also home of the key that won me my trip to the 'Dam!2. \u00a0The servers at The Table are lovely. \u00a0When I arrived at the Table to hunt for the key, I think only 1-2 workers knew of the contest that was going on. \u00a0I was asking the servers if they've seen anything hidden around (they actually had no clue). \u00a0But they were very accommodating in letting me lurk around the restaurant (I did order a tea and snack), and I was trying my best not to weird out their customers by trying to look under the tables / benches, etc. \u00a0They even suggested for places for me to look that I might have missed. \u00a0Low and behold, I eventually found the key, the servers were ecstatic, I was happy :) 3. Food is amazingly good, and the lunch/dinner menu changes often based on the fresh ingredients available. The brunch items are amazing, and luckily we sampled several things off the menu with the Yelp prize. \u00a0We tried the corn fritters with poached egg, the table stack, a few bennies, and some waffles (chockywockydoodah and banoffee). \u00a0We really wanted to try the mixed grill, but it was so popular that it was sold out by the time we ordered (around 11:45am!). \u00a0Everything was delicious, and I really enjoyed the ham hock baked beans. \u00a0The brindisa hot chocolate is pretty good too. Their waffles - oh good God, their waffles are amazing. \u00a0My favorite is the banoffee, but I'd have an affair with the waffles alone and eat them bare naked. \u00a0Crispy on the outside, oh-so-fluffy on the inside. We ended up buying a waffle iron, and after trying numerous recipes, it still doesn't come anywhere close to the one at The Table. WHATS THE SECRET, DAMMIT?! 4. On my 3rd trip to The Table, I had breakfast with my cousin from Oz, whom I finally met after 23 years. Food is still great. We had a grand time, and he said it was one of the better meals he's had in London.5. The Table Cafe believes in using sustainable resources where they can, and they do their part in several ways when it comes to sourcing ingredients, and using enviro-friendly products. \u00a0However, one thing that REALLY sticks is that they actively support the local community by having fresh herbs and vegetables sourced from a community garden down the street, which is run by a charity that focuses on helping the homeless. \u00a0St Mungo's focuses on doing what they can to help the homeless and those who are at risk, by housing them, helping and caring for them, and have preventative measures to keep these people off the street. \u00a0Putting Down Roots is a gardening project aimed at supporting their clients, by providing the opportunity for them to gain skills, qualifications, and voluntary work through therapeutic gardening. The fresh vegetables were being given away to the public, but I believe The Table was the first company to step up and make a deal with them to be their regular supplier. \u00a0Its a win-win situation: The Table supports the community; local fresh veggies are being used; the charity makes some revenue, which goes back to funding more community food growing spaces through London - and creates further opportunities to keep the homeless more engaged and off the street.Amazing.Thanks to The Table for having great food, and being such a strong supporter to the local community. You win. More info here on The Table's values on sustainability and suppliers: thetablecafe.com/supplie\u2026More info here on St Mungo's Putting Down Roots initiative: mungos.org/pdr",

There are large windows looking onto the road outside which keep it light and airy as well. The seats aren't that comfortable for a long sit-down, which is a slight downside.",

    "text": "Hooray for yet another solid brunch spot close to our flat! The Table was a lovely and welcoming spot on a cold winter Sunday. Normally, I'm not crazy about shared tables while dining, but chairs felt spaced out enough so there was plenty of room, and we didn't feel like we were joining the diners next to us! Despite a crowded dining area, we seated straight away.Staff were friendly, without being too invasive, and I really liked being seated adjacent to the open kitchen - as a foodie I love watching the chefs work the line! The menu was simple, with classic brunch staples like the full English (and the veggie version), and a few Table twists - The Stack and some tantalizing waffle creations. My Veggie Full English was absolutely delicious! Perfectly poached eggs, rich and flavourful beans, buttery spinach and herby, meaty portobello mushroom. Yum! The only slight let down was the halloumi cheese. When I grill this at home, I like a bit more golden brown colour to give it a little more texture. Also, my plate could have been a bit warmer, my food seemed to go cold rather quickly. Lovely hot coffee and warm atmosphere made for a great choice for breakfast today. Our neighbours ordered a rather delicious looking waffle coated in chocolate - definitely will try on our next visit!",

    "text": "Can someone please just start up a charity for me to have breakfast/brunch here every morning? It would be ever so greatly appreciated. For real though- this place does an incredible breakfast/brunch, and somehow, although I hear horror stories galore about having to wait ages for a table (at The Table, ha! aren't they so witty!), every time I've come, the wait has been either non-existent or minimal. Which thank god, because I don't know how long I could wait to get my hands on their insane poached eggs and waffles! Although I've never tried their meat-based breakfast options, many brunching companions have, and all can testify to their goodness (honestly, seeing their Full Borough breakfast, I have, on occasion doubted my choice of vegetarian-ness). In addition, they do great lunch burgers and their fixed lunch is fabulous (although, with the fixed menu, it can be a little hit-and-miss if they happen to be serving something you don't particularly like). A particularly positive point of The Table's, is that when you order tea, instead of just bringing you a cup of tea, as most places tend to do, they bring you an entire pot of it (it helps that their pot is nice as well... what doesn't this place get right?)! But, if you're not a tea fan, don't worry- everything else is good too!",

The communal seating was fun and the coffee was the perfect hangover antidote. As for food, I was able to eat about half of the chocolate, yogurt, and berries pancakes. They were kind of crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Not totally the same as American pancakes but still delicious nonetheless! They were also HUGE so I couldn't eat the whole thing, sadly. My date had the Sweetcorn fritter and poached eggs dish. I snagged a bite (or two). I loved the savory flavors all together. Overall, this place is worth visiting again when I'm back in London! Highly recommended for brunch in Southwark!",

    "text": "FINALLY. Ok, so I have been reading review after review about The Table and today I gave in and headed there to try it out and see what all the wonderful Yelpers were talking about and no surprise - they were right! We'd booked a table for 3 and were seated straight away on arrival. The place was PACKED and this was at 2pm on a Saturday. The rest of the area was basically empty so it was really cool actually to be a part of this buzzing and hustling atmosphere within The Table. I ordered The Stack for 3 reasons: 1. Ham hock and chorizo beans (say what?!) 2. Poached eggs 3. Hollandaise sauce! All piled on top of a bagel - I mean this is basically my breakfast dream and then it arrived... Mmmmm. It was fantastic - such an inventive collection of flavours! The beans I LOVED, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce was creamy perfection without being over heavy. My only negative and this is tiny is that the chorizo was plentiful and in some places slightly over powering BUT if you like chorizo you're in heaven and I still really enjoyed the dish overall. I also had a side of halloumi. The halloumi pieces were HUGE chunks - it seemed slightly burned for me but this was only in places and it was still very enjoyable. I must say my whole experience at The Table was a pleasure from start to finish and I would definitely recommend it.",

Some firm favourites as well as more unusual combinations. There's things on toast, pancakes, waffles and more so I found it hard to choose. I decided to go for something a little different as I like to try new things.I went for the bacon, banana and maple syrup pancakes and I wasn't disappointed, although a little bit of me wished I'd gone for the full english pancakes as in hindsight I think I wanted savoury! It was delicious and the food all looked really good. 6 of us had breakfast and the food all arrived together and although it was reasonably busy in there, it didn't take too long (but long enough for it not to be suspicious that it's been sat there for ages or put in a microwave!).My colleague is a vegan and there wasn't anything on the menu that catered for her but she asked for the avocado, bacon and egg on toast without the bacon and egg and with lots of avocado. They put a whole avocado on her toast instead of half and charged \u00a32.50 less so that was really good.It's a little on the pricey side but nice for a treat and I'd go again for sure. There's more on the menu I want to try out!",

We had to plead for tap water. You have to wait to be seated and sometimes the servers are so busy that people just end up sitting, creating a big ol' mess!!! They offer boozey drinks, juices, smoothies, and coffees for beverages. We tried a smoothie and a latte. Latte was strong, smoothie was good. For our meals we ordered the classic English breakfast which came with sausage, beans, a mushroom, bacon, two fried eggs, and toast. Our second meal was the peanut butter, cox out, chocolate, marshmallow waffle.We were extremely full after our meal. I wish I had tried more plates like the bacon banana pancakes. From what we saw, the pancakes were small.The place has an open kitchen and the chefs all look very serious. If you are on this side of the river, make sure you give them a try!

I ordered the veggie option which came fabulously presented (they're big on presentation it's the cafe for an architecture firm and design matters!) A huge platter of asparagus, artichoke, corgette and a duck egg everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The only slightly duff note was my strawberry and coconut cheesecake which was more like a mousse. My brother got the chocolate marquis and definately won the dessert round. Short menu which changes regularly (don't set your heart on the lobster with jerusalm artichokes advertised on the website as I did you will be left hearbroken!)The benches you sit on are heavy (be prepared for an upper body workout when you pull them out) but I think it's more glam than its cafe name would suggest and it has a lovely courtyard if the weather gets warm again.

They have freshly baked bread, soup and favorites such as risotto, pasta, chilly con carne, shepherds pie or quiche type as options. There really is something for everyone.I have been there for brunch and very much enjoyed their eggs benedict and American style pancakes.Very good taste, perfect for a quick lunch catch up with a friend, or even eat alone as I did.

It really is a first-class lunch destination and I would imagine that it more than holds its own in the evenings as well. The dining area consists of a self-service counter and three or four rows of canteen-syle long tables and chairs. It's not a big space, but the design works very well, which is testament to the firm of architects who are responsible and who happen to have their offices above the restaurant. The menu is inventive, with a mix of cold and hot options and there is an emphasis on great ingredients (to be expected perhaps, with Borough Market just down the road). The staff are very professional yet still very friendly, and they seem to be enjoying what they do, which adds something to the vibe. Go take a look.",

That said, the few cafes, bars and restaurants which have sprung up along Southwark St and Bankside seem to have slipped under the radar of the tourist crowd which has got to be a plus! The Table has delicious food at excellent value, the atmosphere is relaxed and feels almost like an extension of nearby Borough Market but without the huge crowds. I've become a regular there for Saturday brunch and would gladly go on Sundays as well except they aren't open on Sundaysyet! Let's start a petition, who's with me!?",

    "text": "Thank u v much twitter 4 ur gr8 recm'dation! A few months ago, when I first began my journey into the world of twitter, I saw that one of my twitter foodie 'friends' was following a place called The Table Cafe (TTC) near Southwark Bridge on the South side of the Thames. I read some of their tweets and was impressed with their daily changing menu. I vaguely remember looking at their website too and noting their seemingly meticulous selection of suppliers, which ticked a lot of boxes (local, organic, etc.). Plus, they listed Monmouth as their coffee supplier, which is a good thing in my book. I kept telling myself the next time I was in that neighborhood (which is very rare), I must drop by and see what it was all about. Welcome to Sweden, can I take your order Walking into TTC, I felt as if I was entering someplace very familiar, but not exactly British. As far as I understand, TTC functions as the canteen for the firm of architects whose ground floor it inhabits (as well as the nearby office buildings). The exterior of the building is mostly glass, accented with angular flashes of bright yellow. Once inside, the clean modern lines and the use of simple and warm wood tables and benches immediately made both of us think of Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular for me. In fact, quite disturbingly, it reminds me of a particular haunt of mine in Stockholm. The fairly modest square room is replete with red rectangular sheets of metal on the ceiling, a long and narrow kitchen, a stock room that is half on display, a stainless steel espresso machine, and a wooden table on top of which some assorted juices, cereals, milks and fruits lay ready and waiting. As you can see from the photos below, cutlery and napkins are provided on the tables and the place settings are the paper menus. You order at the counter. The credit crunch brunch I would hazard to guess that TTC's main business is the weekday lunch crowd, and for that they have a daily changing menu which sounds pretty good and is amazing value with dishes from \u00a32.85 (for a Spanish Tortilla made with free range eggs, heritage potatoes and saut\u00e9ed white onion) upward. I say 'amazing' value because even the most expensive dishes (just under \u00a38) are made from very high quality ingredients and seem very hearty. One of the staff members said they've only started opening on the weekends in the last few months and are still not set on exactly what times they should open for and what menu they should use (i.e. should it just be brunch all day, or brunch then lunch, etc.?). On our visit, the weekend brunch menu was available. It sounded very appetizing and, if any good, would be much better value than most places offering similar brunch menus in the West End. We made our decisions and sat back and waited for the food to arrive over a cup of tea. It was a Twinning's tea bag of Earl Grey by the way, which was surprising as all of their other suppliers seem to be so carefully chosen. But I like their Earl Grey the best of the major brands, so no complaints. After a good ten minutes, one of the chefs brought out the still hot plates to our table. We were a bit giddy as it looked like American sized portions, and visually both plates held a lot of promise. Mrs LF said the following about her breakfast stack: The toasted bagel was an original alternative to muffins, which are usually associated with poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. In this dish, the eggs were perfectly poached with a beautiful orangey yellow yolk as it was split open. The homemade baked beans were yummy, perfectly done and very special; how many places bother making their own baked beans these days? When it comes to baked beans, I tend to like Heinz, actually! But these were as much more delicious and satisfying. The hollandaise sauce was excellent in terms of taste (creamy and with the right amount of tang) and consistency. The chorizo sausage, however, didn't stand out (maybe they forgot to put it in?) as I don't actually remember eating it. Overall, it was very different compared to the breakfast we usually have at our favorite brunch places, which all tend to have the same items on the menu: English Breakfast, Eggs Benedict and so on. 8/10. My pancake looked and smelled beautiful. And I certainly wasn't let down by the taste either. The large and very thin pancake had been cooked through exactly right: the edges were slightly crispy and the middle was soft and fluffy but not at all doughy. The sweetness of the maple syrup and caramelized bananas contrasted well with the saltiness of the extremely crisp and thin streaky bacon. I know this is a very American flavor combination, and I personally love it, although I can understand how some people are not the greatest fans of the extreme sweet and salty combination for breakfast food. For me it all worked together perfectly, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. 8/10. Well worth the detour We thoroughly enjoyed our",

The menu was filled with many brunch options, many of which sounded delicious. This is what we ordered: two mochas and the brunch burger to share. (Disclaimer: we were still quite full from our dinner the night before so we decided to share the burger). The mochas were delicious but the star of the meal was the brunch burger. It was massive: It had fried egg, grilled pineapple, sausage, and veggies. Also came with a side of sweet potato fries. It was very filling and delicious. Just what we needed to start our day of exploring in London. The staff was friendly and the vibe was relaxed. The design is modern with an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs work. Definitely a great find.",

I arrived around 11:40 and was greeted by a friendly girl who notified me that the kitchen was closed until 12. No big deal, this would be my time to enjoy a proper cup of English tea. At 12, she came back and took my order. Eggs Benedict. What a lovely interpretation of a very famous dish. The bacon was succulent, the eggs perfectly poached (and not watery), and the tea strong with flavor. I will definitely be returning with my future visits to London.",

We enjoyed the nice summer breeze and watched the happy brunch goers- everyone seemed to be really pleased with the food and the service. When we finally sat down, we ordered an apple juice and lady grey tea, 2 Forest Benedicts (poached eggs piled on avocado and bacon slices over an English muffin), and some lemon water. My boyfriend absolutely LOVED the fact that they didn't add unnecessary sides or \"filler\" to the meal like potatoes or anything (American style). You just get two eggs Benedict on the plate and we loved that. The service was amicable and quick and the food tasted absolutely delicious. I only didn't award 5 stars because I've been to my fair share of brunch places and it didn't WOW! me, but it really was very good. I'd recommend if you are in the area!",

My luck has been spotty so far with breakfast. \u00a0I actually had to return some eggs that over easy because the yolk was hard.But let's focus on the restaurant at hand. \u00a0The Table, while a bit off the beaten path, it's well worth the effort. \u00a0I chose to come here based on some fellow Yelpians giving it good reviews.A train ride and nice walk later, I end up at The Table.The Entrance is very open, modern, bright, and has a nice continental feel to it. \u00a0Once you come in, the sun pours into the space which is helped by an open kitchen. \u00a0I am a big fan of open kitchens. \u00a0They really give you a bird's eye view of how your meal is made.I sat at the back close to the doors to the patio. \u00a0(Picture Added) \u00a0Unfortunately, it was full. \u00a0The music is a great downtempo electronica that keeps the freshness of the space going throughout the meal.The menu is simple and to the point which helps the customer decide what to get with some confidence. \u00a0It's been a while since I've been there (sorry, I've been really busy and didn't have the time to do it right away), but it was the bagel with beans and chorizo with hollandaise sauce. (Picture included), coffee, and Orange juice.OJ -- freshly squeezed (or extremely fresh form a container)Coffee -- The best cup of Latte I have had in England. \u00a0A perfect balance of flavor and bitterness. \u00a0I didn't even have to add any sugar. (Picture Added)Double bean bagel delight. -- I got this with the Hollandaise sauce on the side since I usually think it's too much for the dish. \u00a0I get the dish and am amazed at the presentation and overall appeal of the dish. \u00a0I make the first cut into it and it's really rather bland. \u00a0I immediately get upset because so far this place rocks! I sit there and take a couple of more bites and then DING, it hits me! \u00a0You big Dummy, try the sauce on it. \u00a0So I take a dollop of Hollandaise and smack it on top of the bagel. \u00a0Once I take a bite, I fully understand the value of Hollandaise. \u00a0It added the tanginess that the dish was missing. \u00a0The creaminess the bagel was interfering with that the beans usually give. \u00a0The best breakfast I have had in England.I spoke with one of the employees and I told him to suggest to customers that they at least get the Hollandaise sauce on the side as the dish in incomplete without it. \u00a0In the US, we love the extremes of everything so Hollandaise is usually too much for my taste.I can't wait to go back in a couple of weekends.",

It starts off with: \"Mainly we specialise in deliciousness...\" which couldn't be closer to the truth. Gotta love a place that calls it like it is. And calls it correctly. Let's review:1. They are located in a veritable culinary no-mans-land2. They make everything they serve in house 3. They source all of their ingredients locally But don't take our word for it, trust your mouth! The moment you bite into whatever deliciousness you finally decide on (I managed to try the eggs benny, smoked salmon, sausage, bagel, pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, yogurt, granola, and even a cheeky sip of a smoothie before people started giving me strange looks. Ok, so I like to sample...)And I must say, I was not disappointed. With lovely strolling locations so nearby, I'll certainly be bringing every incoming set of summer visitors here, with a walk along Southbank or through the Tate planned afterward. In fact, I'm greatly looking forward to it!",

Decor wise it is sleek and contemporary but also warm, friendly and chilled out due to the 'canteen' feel to the place. It is located in the headquarters of renowned architects Allies and Morrison so it comes as no surprise that significant but subtle attention has been paid to the interior.The service is really very good here and the staff are friendly and relaxed. The choice of food is also fantastic with a good variety of both meat and fish dishes. The presentation is lovely and the prices are actually quite reasonable for the quality. It isn't quite in the hub of SE1 so does tend to attract the local workers as opposed to a mixed crowd but it is definitely worth a visit.",

After all, I'd heard good things about their breakfast stack (which comes with their homemade baked beans), and, while tempted, I had just come from the gym after all, and opted for the unusual-but-seemingly-healthier combination of pancakes, maple syrup, caramelised banana and streaky bacon. and a flat white. The pancakes were really nice. The outer parts of the pancake were very crispy, much the way I like my food, but I suspect there are others who may not like that. While the pancakes were soaked in syrup, this was nicely set off by the saltiness of the crispy bacon. Sadly, the flat white was not as good as the pancakes. It was watery and weak, and, honestly, I was very tempted to leave the whole cup virtually untouched. Because I place such a great importance on coffee, I would ordinarily only have given The Table three stars. However, they've been incredibly responsive on Twitter (@thetablecafe), so I'm giving them an extra star for getting back to people so quickly when they're giving feedback. Anyway, after I finished my food, I realised there was a line of about seven people waiting for places. I must have been incredibly lucky, as I just walked in and got a place almost immediately about 45 minutes before that!",

    "text": "The Table is a nice modern breakfast place just 2 minutes from Tate Modern. I visited one saturday with a few friends. The place reminded me of the Ottolenghi on Upper Street. White walls, with long communal tables and bottles of wine on the shelves (but without the dazzling dessert display). The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. I had the scrambled eggs on toast. I got much more of the egg than i expected (it costs only \u00a34). Even the others were happy with their orders ... ranging from simple eggs to smoked salmon.The only problem is that their billing system is a bit disorganized. Some people were asked to pay while ordering, some later. For those paying later, they frequently mixed up the orders. So you would do well to remember what you have eaten.To conclude, its a very useful place to go to for refreshments once in a while if you are living nearby or visiting Tate.",

    "text": "Update I promised I'd give these guys another try and I'm so pleased I did this morning. At OH MY GOD WHAT TIME in the morning (actually, 9am, but I'm a lazy freelancer), I found myself back here again. Surprisingly quiet for a rainy morning, I opted for poached eggs on toast with portobello mushrooms and was treated to excellent, nay, perfect eggs with runny yolks. I was happy as a clam and yummy noises and happy smiles were made about the bacon sandwich my companion was eating (he has in fact told me to mention how nice it was). The staff are friendly as ever (not least when I changed my mind at the counter three times because I hadn't had any caffeine) and I'm more than happy to bump them up to four stars. The final star is reserved for when they get free wifi. I might have got off to a rocky start with Table Cafe, but I really like it here. Update I wanted to really really really love this cafe. There isn't much in this area, and as I'm a south east London girl, I'm also on the hunt for cafes this side of the river so I can go to meetings without trekking all the way into Soho. I can reach London Bridge in 20 minutes, it's twice that to get into central. I had a chat with Table Cafe on Twitter and they were lovely. I really liked their approach, and their service. But my eggs ben wasn't up to scratch. The eggs weren't runny (which too me is the key part of the dish) and the hollandaise was just too sharp for my tastes. I reckon I'd give Mr. Hinchcliffe a run for his money as 'King of Egg Benedict in London' and this just didn't stand up for me. I like the setting, I loved the freshly squeezed fruit juice (although it's unclear if it's bottomless, we doubted it was, but the 'pour your own' could get confusing and we didn't want to get told off). I really enjoyed my morning here. I will come back, I think my eggs were a disappointing one off, but unless they get better next time, they're staying on three stars. Always happy to give places another shot, especially when I like everything else, so I'll keep you posted.",

    "text": "Well, I had one of those rare, disappointing experiences where Yelp led me in a bad direction. There was absolutely nothing I liked about my experience at The Table Cafe.First, the food was bland, greasy, and gross. I ordered the farmer's market breakfast, which is normally two fried eggs, potatoes lyonnaise, and sausage, but I substituted the sausage for smoked salmon instead.The eggs were totally fine, but the potatoes were flavorless and greasy and the salmon was incredibly dry and had so much gross fat and connective tissue that I could only eat about 50 percent of it. After my meal, I felt kind of sick.My experience at Table Cafe wasn't made any better by the service. There was a sign by the door that said I should wait to be seated, but no one welcomed me when I went in so I had no idea where I should go. Eventually I just wandered up to the front counter to order, where they told me to find a table. After I finished eating, no one brought me the bill so I went back up to the front counter to pay. I usually trust Yelp, and this place does have a lot of great reviews, but in my experience Table Cafe was gross and incredibly expensive.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely terrific! My wife and I arrived in London for our trip on the red-eye, and after a sleepless (and very quick) night on the plane and a morning spent at customs and trying to get to our hotel in rush hour (which we finally did), we were starving, exhausted, and in need of coffee. A quick Yelp search revealed that there was a bistro just a 2-minute walk from our hotel. I made a quick reservation for lunch and we strolled down the street moments later.Upon arriving, I noticed how clean and open the space looked, complete with indoor seating and outdoor seating (perfect for a beautiful summer day like the one we experienced, although we chose to dine inside). A few moments after being seated, our waiter came by with some water and took our drink orders. My wife and I both ordered coffee. After perusing the menu, we then decided on our entrees. My wife ordered the full English breakfast while I ordered the all-day breakfast pancake.After maybe 20 minutes, our food arrived, and the presentation alone was wonderful. We took a few \"insta-worthy\" (and Yelp-worthy) photos and then took our first few bites. Man was that pancake delicious! It had a slightly crispy exterior and soft interior that was just cooked too perfectly, and the scrambled eggs, bacon and leek sausage on top provided the perfect complimentary flavor. Meanwhile, my wife really enjoyed the Full English breakfast, complete with scrambled eggs (substituted for fried eggs), bacon, leek sausage, homemade baked beans, a roasted tomato and roasted mushroom. Everything was superb!I have to admit, the food was so good that we went back the next day as well. This time, I opted for the Spring chicken (with grilled English sweet corn and bacon mash in a garlic butter sauce) and my wife ordered the all-day pancake. Everything was out of this world!So why only the 4 stars? The service was not quite a 5-star establishment. There were times we felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. That being said, if we asked for something (water, the check, etc.), we eventually got it. Nevertheless, I wouldn't let the service spoil the culinary experience. The food is terrific and worth the trip!",

    "text": "Waiting in the cold and damp for 45 minutes staring at eight free tables the entire time I had convinced myself was all going to be worth it if the food lived up to the hype. Sadly, it didn't. Not even close.I had the Full Borough English with black pudding, eggs over easy, bacon extra crispy, and a Fellini Bellini. Let's start with the good. The Bellini was great, the fizz to pur\u00e9e ratio was spot on and I loved the strawberry flavour. The sausage was well seasoned, great texture, the tomato was juicy and sweet, and the sourdough was tasty. Now let's talk about the, um, beans. One clue is that if you're looking at baked beans and they're bright white, you know your tomato sauce is not rich or plentiful enough to cover them. They were also tiny, like the Tesco Value ones, and mixed with an anemic pulled pork. Pork and beans are usually as perfect together as karaoke, soju and 80s rock ballads, but The Table fumbled both dishes and then hoping no one would notice, shoved them together. Did anyone in the kitchen even taste what they made? Poorly seasoned, poorly executed. I could tell you the black pudding was cereal heavy and therefore very dry, or the eggs tiny and fried so impatiently the white was crispy and the yolk more 'kinda stressed out' than 'easy like Sunday morning'. But you're skim reading at this point...As a Brit living in NYC, I have become used to a level of service that still, you know, tries. Despite a coven of waitresses standing around gossiping and side-eyeing patrons, there was no silverware on the table and the turnover of tables seemed glacial. Speaking of which, we were seated by the door despite open tables elsewhere (and knowing we were chilled to the core because of the long wait) which is just careless at best, or kinda mean. When your waitress asks 'How was everything?' you say 'Sadly average' and she ignores you, you know that they have enough people queuing not to care that they could have done so, so much better. Except if this level of cost-cutting on the food and overstaffing on bored, passive aggressive servers continues, you'll find the queues dry up just like the black pudding.",

Fluffy eggs, bacon a little to crispy for my taste and gorgeous sausages. My friend ordered blueberry with waffles again the same excellent quality of waffles the blueberries brought a loveley sour twist to her rendition of waffles and little one ordered plain pancakes and for plain they were pretty good. Perfectly crisp on the outside and wonderfully fluffy on the inside. Generous portions hot chocolate was OK. Will defiantly be going back again to try the other amazing goodies on the menu. Seating area outside looked nice but unfortunately it was chucking down with rain. My only real complaint is they close by 4pm over the weekend.",

I also asked for scrambled eggs instead of fried and they made it using a lot of cream which I liked. Didn't really like the spinach or tomato but they went well with the halloumi, which I didn't like at first but definitely started to towards the end of the meal. The best part of the meal was easily the mushroom. They were extremely thick, juicy and the green sauce on top of it was extremely tasty and went really well with the mushroom. I would've been fine with just the mushrooms as a meal. I also got the free Fried Chips, but thought they were a little too overfryed and too hard to eat. Overall, definitely lives up to the hype and hopefully can come back to try some more of the dishes.",

People kept coming in and there were many reservations (marked on the tables). The outdoor are looked nice but we were sat inside. I overheard the entire outside area was reserved. So if you want to sit out there, make a reservation. The food portions were huge! My all day breakfast came with a massive pancake, 3 pieces of bacon, a full sausage link and I'm guessing 2-3 scrambled eggs. I ended up eating about a third of what I ordered. Again it was so much good! Everything was delicious but the pancake was the star of my meal. It was buttery, fluffy and just all around delicious. Meal for 2 (with one glass of OJ) was 27\u00a3",

It was pretty basic. Maybe even less than basic. It seems like they just threw it together. They took a hard piece of toast, added some chewy bacon, layered it with some sliced tomatoes, placed two small halves of avocado, and then topped it with two poached eggs. I would hardly call this a bruschetta. \"Things on toast\" would be a more accurate description. It was very difficult to eat. You definitely need a fork and knife for this situation. Not sure where all if the great reviews are coming from.",

When we arrived I asked for a table and straight away there was an attitude from the manager, however I ignored it and as we were told there would be at least a 30 minute wait for a table, he took my name and we popped for a coffee at the Black Sheep Coffee place next door. We went back within 15 minutes. When I returned I asked where we were in the queue and the manager laughed in my face and said he already said my name out so had given my table to someone else. He then ignored us and started sitting other parties including people who had just arrived. I then asked if we were going to be able to get a table and in a very patronising and smug tone he started to re explain to me what had happened. So rather than put up with anymore rudeness we left and we found somewhere else. It's a shame because the food looked good.",

The menu has the usual range of breakfast fare, like eggs, pancakes, and bagels. There are shishi touches like \"ham hock baked beans\". For my money, there's already enough pork in a full English. My full English was a large as it was delightful. For me, sausages make or break an English breakfast, and The Table excelled in this department. The bacon was also deliciously crispy - none of that colorless and insipid leather. \u00a0Sadly the ensemble wasn't piping hot, forcing me to rush. However, when I pointed this out, the waiter listened patiently, and offered us free drinks. The staff were friendly and efficient. I was initially sceptical about paying \u00a310-12 for a breakfast dish, but on reflection prices were justified given the quality of the ingredients. Postamble (should be a word, I feel): The Table faces North, so it doesn't get any morning sun. I have a long-held fantasy of enjoying a divine breakfast while bathed in sunshine, so please let me know if you know such a place, so I can be complete.",

    "text": "Today was my second outing to The Table in as many weeks. Last week I went for brunch and had the sweetcorn fritters with tomato compote, spinach and poached eggs. And today I went for lunch and had the ranch burger with fries. The restaurant itself is pleasant and simply decorated. There is an open kitchen and the majority of the seating is on shared benches (a bit annoying if there you are sandwiched between two other parties all trying to have different conversations). My brunch experience was satisfactory, both my cousin and I felt that the sweetcorn fritters were not \"sweetcorny\" enough although the eggs, hollandaise and spinach were nothing special to write home about but still nice enough for me to want to return to sample some other things on the menu. Which brings me to today's lunch. The ranch burger is served with the obligatory brioche bun (perhaps a bit too browned in the oven), the patty itself (I was pleased to note that this is one of the dwindling number of places that will still serve a burger medium rare), their \"secret sauce\" (a dill, mayonnaisey/hollandaisey concoction with a hint of horseradish), generous chunks of gherkin (served outside the burger so that if, like me, gherkins are your arch enemy, they can be easily avoided) and a nice portion of fries. Now I have to get a bit negative :( In contrast to my companions' fries mine seemed to have an inordinate amount of salt. I tasted them and sure enough they were so salty my tongue was crying. Annoying when the other fries on the table had no such problem. Of course there will always be wall inconsistencies between dishes but to dump an ocean of salt onto one plate and not realise is just ridiculous. To give credit where credit is due I attracted the attention of our waitress (nb this took a while despite the restaurant not being that busy), and she was very apologetic and helpful. She immediately took my plate over to the kitchen and showed the chef. I saw him taste some of the fries, pull a little face and then quickly turned to the cooker to make me some more (oh the joys of an open kitchen, nothing can be hidden!) Within 5 minutes I had a bowl of fresh and appropriately seasoned fries which were delicious. I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 because of the fries incident and the difficulty I had in attracting the attention of the waitress, a problem which arose again when we wanted to pay. But don't let this deter you, both times I enjoyed the food and would go again. A hint for anyone thinking of going, book in advance as it does get rather busy around lunchtimes and if you'd like a bit more space and privacy request one of the stand alone tables at the side of the restaurant.",

    "text": "I was staying in the fabulous CitizenM hotel around the corner and needed brunch pretty desperately, so decided to give The Table another shot. This time it was much better.Food:- I went for the eggs benedict this time around, and was really happy with it. The eggs were perfectly poached, the bacon plentiful and crispy, and the hollandaise was just right. Tangy and flavourful without overpowering the eggs and bacon. Yum. It was about \u00a38, and very good. - Husband had the Full English, and made quick work of it. He said it was one of the nicest posh English breakfasts he's had, and ranked it on par with the one at Ziloufs (our favourite restaurant in London). It was \u00a312, so on the higher end of pricing for them, but he said it was very good. - Coffee was okay. I am a firm believer that good coffee doesn't need sugar. If prepared properly, a latte should already be sweet enough (lactose, yo). However, I needed two spoonfuls of sugar in my coffee. I suspect it was too hot or possibly the beans overroasted, Starbucks style. Not sure why, but it was more bitter than my ex. I will opt for a juice blend in future.Service:- Much better than last time. Quicker, friendlier, and with a sense of humour. Good stuff.Layout:- Still nowhere to put your coat (there's a rack in the back of the restaurant by the loos, but space is limited and I wouldn't use it unless I was sitting near it).- The tall table is preferable in my opinion - individual stools and ample space behind you to tuck a small suitcase out of the way.- Pairs will likely have to share their table with random strangers. Great if you're extroverted and like meeting new people. Bit awkward if you're hungover or trying to have a personal conversation.If you're going to need a table for 4 or more, book it ahead. We got there on a Saturday morning around 11:00 and didn't have to wait for a table for 2. We did have to share our 4-top with a random dude by the end, though. Little bit awkward.I think I would go back again if I were in the area. I wouldn't trek out to SE1 for it, though. I stand by my earlier assessment that it is a little over-priced. It's nice food, but some of the menu items are \u00a31-2 more than I think they should be. That's not a dealbreaker for me, though, and it definitely beats a Pret bacon buttie.",

    "text": "You know you're going to be in for a good experience when the people that work in a venue are obviously proud of the fact. I think this can certainly be said of The Table after seeing how much care goes into everything they do.I went for dinner after seeing an amazing offer on Yelp of 60% off the bill in acknowledgement of a new menu. \u00a0I wasn't really sure what we were in for as the restaurant is located in an area not known for quality.We started with some expertly made cocktails. They haven't got a complicated cocktail menu but have some delicious classics. This are expertly created at a low bar along one side of the room and delivered by the barman. After recently having cocktails at several other restaurants I can certainly say that these were more than worth the \u00a37.50 they charge. The glass isn't \u00a0filled with crushed ice with only a dribble of cocktail. No, these are proper sized drinks that will last you.The food was all fairly classic, including a green bean salad, smoke eel pat\u00e9 and smoked haddock fish pie. It was probably some of the most flavour packed food I've ever had. Portions were also well judged, thankfully leaving just enough room to have a delicious dessert.This place isn't just about the bacon sarnies. This is quality food and drink all day every day. Why not 5 stars? It had nothing to do with the service or the food. There was just something about the ambience that didn't grab me. Maybe it's because my seat was facing a wall. I'm definitely going back to see if I can give them the fifth star.",

The table has a good brunch menu, served in nice surroundings, in a sort of unexpected location, by nice people. We did have to wait 20 minutes but once seated, weren't hurried. To the food - most thngs come with hollandaise and a poahced egg, which is all good by me. I had the sweetcorn fritters, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise, and served with a really good tomato chutney. The fritters themselves were just ok - if I went back I'd have benedict instead - but the hollandaise was indeed excellent. Also noteworthy good coffee. To end we shared a pancake (notice - singular), which was delciious with yoghurt and berries and syrup, but I was very glad I hadn;t ordered it as the main event - I'd have been hungry and a pancake is a pancake is a pancake. The pancake felt sort of expensive but the prices were just the right side of reasonable. A long way for me to go for brunch but I'd make the trip again, and I'd like to try it for dinner.",

Highlights:-- Bacon baguettes are legendary-- Recently got into their English muffins with bacon and egg-- Flat whites are brilliant, made using Monmouth coffee-- Their cafe made cookies and cakes are first class!Unfortunately it's considerably better during the week than it is at weekends, it's \u00a0bit of shambles service wise then. \u00a0They change the payment system and it just doesn't work. \u00a0If you get a chance to visit try 12 - 1.30 during the week.

Very quick out, but I would happily have waited if it meant I had freshly cooked bacon.I had the Eggs Benedict. It looked promising, arriving on a massive plate and with a pleasing amount of hollandaise. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but that was it. Served on two cold muffins, that were more like stale scones and ate like stale bread. I would have liked something crunchier. Fresher. Toasted at the very least. The bacon was frazzled to within an inch of its life, rubbery and pre-cooked. The hollandaise was utterly forgettable, if a bit too lemony, not a good balance of favours all round. I will definitely come back, if only to sample something else. Service and the coffee both excellent.",

The little outdoor space by the side is an added bonus.The scrambled eggs with salmon served on sourdough bread is divine. The Borough Full Breakfast (2 x fried eggs, bacon, pork and leek sausage, smoked baked beans, grilled tomato, Portobello mushroom and sourdough toast) is very filling; not a good idea if you're looking for something light.For what it is meant to be, I would have gladly given a 5 star rating except that what seemed like a delicious pancake, had an uncooked core. I mistook it for a custard stuffing of sorts until I tasted it and was put off. I'm going to give the Table Cafe the benefit of the doubt and deduct one star only.",

    "text": "Right now this must be the best brunch place in London in terms of the quality of the food. The food is just amazing. The full veggie breakfast is probably the best vegetarian \"full English\" I have ever had. You won't miss the meat, as the grilled haloumi and the really meaty mushrooms give a lot of texture. Even the grilled tomatoes are \"just right\", firm and great tasting, not the runny mess you sometimes get, so the quality of the ingredients is superb. Big portion too. I could eat this every day.I also can recommend their waffles - to die for. I had the blueberry waffle, which is packed with blueberries on top, great maple syrup and indulgent sweet cream as well, making it just heavenly good. No skimping on the ingredients, it's a heavenly mess. And even the waffle is crispy soft like it should be (but where few succeed).On the negative side the room is very tightly packed with people - the guy sitting next to me last time I was here was shouting so hard to to his girlfriend across the table my ear hurt. No manners. The environment is nothing special, just a room with tables. Service is good too overall, fast and attentive, but if you come on your own they try and stuff you away at a sort of bar by the door (meaning you'll be cold and have the door slam next to you!). And when you ask not to sit there they look really bothered and not welcoming - always. That's not a great way to treat customers! But considering the extremely great food, the behaviour was worth it.Overall, this would probably be a not so great place considering the above, but whoever the chefs are, and whoever sources their ingredients, make this a five star place as the food is just that awesome.",

I did a quick google search for brunch just in london, haha we live fairly spread out, so are willing to travel up to 40mins. The Table popped up, and we decided to meet there at 12pm on a Sunday. I had expected to wait in line to be seated, as with most places that don't take bookings, you generally have to wait. My friends arrived early and managed to be seated right away, WINNING!!! Once i arrived, I was overwhelmed by the delicious looking food, and the amount of food on the menu. There was so much choice. I settled on the breakfast bruschetta, the other ordered the corn fittas, and the pancake with meats. The food came out fairly quickly, and the serving sizes are quite generous for the prices. Everything tasted amazing. I had food envy of the pancakes, and will definitely be back to order those. The only negative was when we wanted to leave and pay the bill, it took quite a lot of time. However the staff did applogise, so I wasn't too put off by it.",

    "text": "I have had the Table on my list of places to go for brunch a long time and since it is the final weeks of living within easy walking distance I decided to go for it. Actually even reserved seats to be sure to get a spot. Was definitely a good idea as the place was packed already around 10 on a Saturday. It does not look like much when entering, I do more get a feel of chain such as Vapiano or Sig and Lettuce as the decor is very uninspiring. We were promptly seated, fairly uncomfortable high tables with nowhere to hang coats but fortunately we did not come here for the decor or seats. We quickly glanced at the menu and since I was really starving I went for the Full English. The pork and leek sausages were really great and the same for the tomatoes that were grilled but yet firm and flavorful (maybe it is just me but i struggle to appreciated most cooked vegetables as I often dislike the texture), the rest (mushrooms, beans, eggs and toast) were standard and the bacon was a bit disappointing as it was rather dry (not crisp). My better half went for the blueberry cream waffles and those were standard, nothing special at all.Did not even try to order the coffee as I had a look at the beans and quickly gathered that no amount of skill can produce good coffee from that type charcoal beans so ordered tea instead. The tea was ok but in general I expect a decent restaurant to serve loose leaf teas instead using tea bags.Update after the owner's little comment - I guess people's opinion of coffee may differ but that it is Allpress they are serving is at least no in my view a sign of quality (see my review of Allpress, yelp.com/biz/allpress-es\u2026) but I am sure there are people who like it (I prefer other London roasters like Workshop, Tap or Notes every day of the week). As for the tea - still not impressed, if it was loose leaf tea inside the tea bags it surely did not result in a great cup of tea. That said will perhaps give the place another chance.So the food is perhaps slightly better than average but the prices are also a bit higher than average so in this area on Saturday \u00a0I would rather walk over to the Maltby street market for Breakfast waffles or a stop at Bea's.",

When I went back again a couple of weeks ago, it managed to totally outdo itself and firmly place itself in my top 3 brunch places in London list. My friend & I shared the Brioche French Toast (AMAZING!) and the Belle Helene Waffles. Both were so tasty that we were seriously considering ordering another plate (even though we were totally stuffed already). Can't wait to go back there again.",

    "text": "Brunch Brunch Brunch. My new weekend routine brought me to The Table last week. The restaurant isn't very big, but it's filled with large communal tables and an open kitchen. Our group of 4 girls terrorized the menu and ordered a dish for ourselves and two to share. We started with the Banoffee Waffles & the Blueberry banana bread. Both were winners! A little too much sweet for one person but great as a starter to share around the table! Our own individual dishes started to arrive around the table, a range from chorizo, beans to eggs benedict and florentine, to sweet corn fritters. It may not be the best place for brunch in London, but it definitely isn't a bad choice. Get there early, because when we left there was a queue out the door.",

You can tell the care and love of food here. No question about that. Tonight though, the service was what let it down ultimately. Servers outside having smoke breaks throughout service. Okay, the place wasn't mobbed, but still, it's mid service and doesn't give a good impression when no one is around. What annoys me more at restaurants, is adding in a 12.5% service charge to a table of two. Automatically taken off your card when you pay. Firstly, you hardly earned it and secondly, it should apply to tables over six. I would have left a tip anyway, I always do. That should be determined by me though, not you.The stars are for the food. Zero for service and care and attention. It's no wonder the place is empty on the evening...You Don't Gotta Eat Here...",

    "text": "First thing I will say about The Table Cafe is that it is busy. If you can make a reservation then please do but if not the staff are super friendly and will do their utmost to squeeze you in. I mean that literally. While there are a few tables set for four the place is mainly made up of long sharing tables so unless you're a larger group it's very likely you'll end up sharing with strangers which can make things a bit difficult when it comes to who ordered what but more on that later.We were very lucky in that they were able to seat us right away but it did mean sharing a table of four with another twosome of diners. Our drinks order was taken very quickly and we were soon presented with a milkshake for my friend and my own glass of prosecco.A few minutes later we were also given a bottle of water which I thought was great given that we hadn't asked for it but I was quite thirsty so poured a glass only to realise after taking a sip that it was sparkling. It was at this point that the men we were sharing the table with mentioned to their server (who was different from our server!) that they hadn't been given their sparkling water that we put two and two together and figured out that the water we'd just been given was not in fact complimentary but was meant for them. Oops! Luckily the server understood and everything was quickly sorted. I can imagine that this happens quite a bit when they have different groups end up sharing as we were.To eat my friend went for the pancakes with crispy bacon, caramelised banana and Canadian maple syrup which she had been craving that morning and was the reason I stumbled upon this place on Zomato.For myself, while I wanted to be a bit more adventurous and try The Stack I really hate beans and didn't think it would be quite the same without them so ended up having the salmon and scrambled eggs. While not as good as my mums scrambled eggs (I've yet to come across any that are) these are definitely the closest I've found in London. They were light and creamy and just melted in your mouth. Every last morsel was cleared from both plates and if that doesn't convince you how good it was nothing will!It took a while for us to get the bill (the till ran out of paper just as they were trying to get some of them) and then even longer to pay but given how busy this place is it's not surprising that the service can slip a little at times. Overall though it was a great meal and I would definitely like to return.",

The service was really fast on a busy Saturday and you get a free espresso shot with your first check-in - amazing. I knocked one star off because I sat at the bar table facing the hallway outside and literally had the people standing in line watching me eat. Maybe a window shade is required when the lineup is long. You must come here.",
