My favorite mezzes are the calamari - really crispy and with a few whitebait and prawns thrown in! and of course the falafel and hummus. Delicious!",

    "text": "Beirut Street Food? What? I randomly walked by this place recently when it was closed on a bank holiday and had to go back to check out the food. I'm happy to report that this tiny hidden gem on Green's Court in Soho is fantastic! It's a small sit down cafe with cute wooden tables and pillows made out of middle eastern scarves turned hipster fashion signature turned cafe decoration. They've got a counter filled with seriously droolworthy snacks and desserts, from multiple kinds of baklava to a selection of meat, spinach, or cheese pastries, to some incredible looking tarts like fig, apple cinnamon, and rosemary. \u00a0Then they've got a kitchen hidden somewhere that turns out fabulous hot dishes at great prices. We sat right next to the counter, where the smell of the desserts was overwhelmingly delicious. I think i basically stuck my face in them to inhale the scent, so my apologies if you get a nose print in your pastry next time. We ordered a bunch of different things whose names I can't remember - a really fresh, lemony, zesty salad of greens and crunchy pita chips , a spinach pastry, a kibbe appetizer of small chunks of lamb, and a fantastic slow cooked lamb casserole with rice where you could cut the meat with a fork. Yum. I also had a big pot of mint tea and they brought ample warmed pitas to dip in the olive oil they have bottled on every table. We chatted with the owners, who let me try a baklava for free. They just opened and will hopefully soon have a liquor license as well as tables outside. They're super nice and the food is fantastic. I will definitely be going back soon to try everything else on the menu. Best of all, we were stuffed with the four dishes and the grand total was under 20 pounds. You can pop in for a sit-down meal or grab a tasty snack to go. Beirut street food...who knew?",

    "text": "I was expecting a lot from Yalla Yalla given the write-ups here but left slightly disappointed. The thing that struck me most about their Soho branch was its small size. This meant that every available counter space was occupied with food or utensils and forced the staff to make their way around the branch in a strange balletic routine requiring them to interact in some way with whatever they were moving past at that moment e.g. squeezing round the counter, moving something out the way, taking something further along in its preparation, take order etc. I ordered a Lamb Shawarma and a freshly squeezed orange juice for takeaway. The orange juice was pretty decent, but the Shawarma seemed rather ordinary. Then there was the price - I didn't get much change from a tenner, which surprised me somewhat for takeaway food (while accepting that freshly squeezed orange juice is pretty pricey whenever you get it).However, the customers eating in seemed content and the food they had looked pretty appetising. So I'll definitely be back to try the eat-in experience and may revise my rating then.",

    "text": "Maybe in the two years since I've last been to Yalla Yalla I'm really no longer concerned with emerging as a Greasy McFatterson after eating its meze. Because my most recent visit was a revelation of everything oily and delicious. The baba ganoush was simply the most fabulous taste explosion of culinary prowess that ever was or ever will be. In London or in Beirut. Usually, I don't like baba ganoush. In fact, I've never eaten baba ganoush anywhere and thought, 'Hot damn, that is some fine baba ganoush.'But I ate the baba ganoush at Yalla Yalla and thought, 'Hot damn, that is some fine baba ganoush. Bring on the pomegranate seeds!' And I proceeded to eat it all so quickly that my dining companion didn't even have a chance. Not. a. chance.So I'm jumping on this Yummy Yummy bandwagon. Yalla Yalla is the place to be, especially for a late-night, post-bar, Soho meze dinner. Sure, there are loads of places for you to eat in Soho, but don't be a sucker. Everyone needs a bit more pomegranate in her life.",

Unfortunately, they don't take bookings, which means you inevitably have to wait. On our most recent visit, the food was very good- the hummus and baba ganoush were especially tasty, as was the moussaka. I was sort of disappointed by the tabbouleh, which was light on the bulgar wheat and heavy on the vinegar. Our server was super friendly and attentive despite the place being crammed as it always is.

We loved the sharing menu and we went with a suggested larger group set menu. This had meant that we'd tried a variety of the dishes and also we didn't spend umming and aaring about what to order. Great value for money. I would definitely recommend if you're after something fresh and something a little different.",

Yalla Yalla is a cozy small restaurant located in an alley (small street) right off of lively Brewer Street in the SOHO area of the City of Westminster in London. \u00a0It sort of reminded me of the cozy neighborhood family owned restaurants I used to frequent in my hometown of San Francisco.The Baba Ghannouj was wonderful, nicely done with the right amount of smokiness \u00a0and creamy. \u00a0The Soujoc (spicy Lebanese sausages) was my favorite, although not a fan of liver I really liked the Sawda Djej it was tasty, very good, flavorful, \u00a0I would order it again. Hommus was perfect, I found the Batata Harra (spicy sauteed potatoes) to be good but not spicy enough they were more like breakfast potatoes, they were good but needed a little more kick to be described as \"spicy\". \u00a0 Mixed Grill was another great dish, meat was perfect, juicy, nicely flavored. I definitely will return, the place is great for dine in or take out.",

I came in pretty late - around midnight after catching a flick - the place was still pretty busy. It's a tiny joint that has perhaps 10 tables. Service is very polite and prompt and I ordered some baba ganoush, hummus and lam kofta kebab. I usually judge a middle eastern food place by the hummus (smooth, lots of tahini, little garlic bite) and this was was very good. The bread was fluffy and warm - overall comfort food.Prices are very reasonable - this is not a fancy restaurant - but clean, comfy and most importantly delicious.It's a bit hard to find being hidden in a dodgy alley in Soho and across from sticky sex shop - but don't let that be a deterrent - the food makes up for it ;)",

The restaurant itself is not very large and the space was packed for 3pm, so I chose take-away. This was my first time sampling Baba Ghannouj, and it was delicious! The dish was rich and creamy, yet balanced by the drizzle of lemon juice. The pomegranate seeds and chopped mint were a nice addition, and really brought out the roasted flavors of the aubergine. This came accompanied by 3 medium-pieces of pita bread. Served warm, this mezze was more than a meal! Fairly-priced as well, Yalla Yalla is a great choice for Middle Eastern food.",

As soon as you walk into the modern yellow and wooden establishment your intuition tells you, your about to engage in an outer body food experience!Greeted by friendly staff, you are sat down with a mixed olive and pickles plate. Yum!!! Once you've had a few nibbles, you are given the menu, which might I say, is very very good! Lots of choice to tantalise the palette! Lamb, chicken, vegetables seasoned with excellent spices. I recommend the lamb Shawarma, which is succulent tender pieces of seasoned lamb, with rice, pitta, salad and garnish (the definition of heaven! Jheeze)! Compliment this with a fruity cocktail or simply a glass of still water to really appreciate all flavours. The portions sizes are big and you will most probably take a doggy bag, well, unless you suffer from tasty food glutton!

I think we slightly annoyed the staff as we were chatting so much and each time they came to take our order, we hadn't had the chance to look at the menu, maybe not but that's the impression I got. The food was very tasty and we chose and shared the right amount - 5 mezzo dishes - Lebanese sausages, houmous, baba ganoush, calamari, fried shrimp and whitebait (least favourite dish), halloumi and filo parcels of feta cheese (amazing!) We had a berry Martini and Turkish Delight cocktail which were delicious especially the former which you could taste the alcohol in whereas you couldn't in the latter. I was quite surprised when the bill came at the price as it seemed quite pricey and was nearly \u00a360. Friendly and quick service. Handy location, just offer Brewer Street and close to Old Compton St in the heart of Soho.",

We ordered a whole range of dishes but what really stood out for me were the pastries and halloumi.

    "text": "I had this review drafted as 3 stars after our first visit, but I'm now content to bump it up to 4. Yalla Yalla is a tiny little nook that serves a limited range of tasty Lebanese treats. I get my Lebanese street food kicks from Tasty Lebanon on the other end of Soho (do check out my review for them for more deets) but sometimes you want a little more variety (read: not kebab), and that's where Yalla Yalla steps in.First things first: is it as good? Eh. Item per item, I think the tabbouleh, hummus, and falafel are better at TL. However, Yalla Yalla offers some 'real food' options that will knock your socks off. Lamb anything? Stellar. Do make sure you give their specials a go: their lamb chops with pomegranate molasses and aubergine salad was the best meal I've had in months, with the lamb slightly pink, ridiculously rich, beautifully seasoned, and offset by smoky, tangy aubergine dip studded with pomegranate seeds and the tang of pomegranate molasses. Y u m.Other things are a bit of a disappointment. None of the starters really stood out; the platters (we opted for veggie) are the best value to share and come with a range of mezze. The chicken livers, much touted by some reviewers, failed to shine for me: they were soupy, lacked any redeeming browned bits, and were frankly a little stale. Speaking of stale, the baklava certainly is, or at least it was the one time we tried it.Also, without any bearing on the review, their seats are hella uncomfortable, and you're either sitting a little too low or way too high. Awkward. I get that they want to cram in as many seats as possible into a tiny footprint but that doesn't really make things right.Final point: portions feel a little skimpy for the money compared to similar offerings, especially in the starters.",

I popped to Yalla Yalla for lunch last Thursday: the room is extremely small and it's more of \u00a0take-out place I'd say, even though they managed to squeeze in a handful of tables. Ours was right in front of the door, which was for some reason kept open with a stool. We sat down and I had no space whatsoever where to put my coat and handbag (I don't mind leaving my stuff on the floor but...there's no space on the floor. And it being a stool I couldn't hang anything on the back of a chair either). Particularly peeved at how uncomfortable it was. That said, the food was really nice. My friend ordered a wrap and I had lamb cutlets with an aubergine and pomegranate sort of salsa. I couldn't spot any aubergine in there, but the lamb was very very nice nonetheless. I could have eaten double that. It was also a bit difficult to get the staff's attention, which is weird considering how small the place is, and our table was nearly in front of the counter where people queue to order/pay. I think one of the tables against the wall would have made for a better experience, but alas we didn't get one. So I'll have to leave it at that.",

What I've resorted doing is to take said items to go and sit down at the nearby Soho Square instead.There's one pet-peeve I have with this place: their staff rarely smiles and seems always stressed and overworked...if it weren't for the delicious treats I get here, I wouldn't have the urge to come back here that often.",

I have enjoyed rainy afternoons in here and no matter how crowded it gets and how difficult to squeeze between the tables, the atmosphere is always friendly and the decor is cute. There have been times so busy that newcomers just make the rounds and hover near crowded tables in the hopes that you and your coat and bag will evacuate the tiny table and give them somewhere to sit and I don't blame them, the place really is great. The food is inexpensive and delicious!! It's the perfect place to order lots of small dishes to share with a friend and just have a good time.I like to get a lot of little dishes to share and one main. There are lots of great small dishes on the menu, from the standard hummus, which is decent, to my favourites the yummy kibbe lahme (minced lamb and wheat) and the delicious arayes (pita bread with minced lamb). The tabbouleh is not to my taste because it has more onions than I like but others might not mind.They also serve soujoc, a lebanese sausage that I like and don't find everywhere, but this one is just passable and I wasn't a big fan. The rest of the food more than makes up for it though. \u00a0My favorite mains are \u00a0the classic chicken shawarma and the slow cooked lamb casserole is very tender and fantastic too and I recommend it wholeheartedly.A trip here for me is never complete without a pot of perfect mint tea to share and chat over. This place is a gem and I never mind the crush in here because I'm so happy with everything that is on my tiny table:) Get here early if you can though!",

    "text": "Yalla Yalla has had raving reviews, and the consistent line outside the door of their tiny shop is testament to how popular it is. My family and I waited an hour and a half, so I highly recommend you make reservations or come at non-peak hours!For starters, we had the baba ghanouj, spicy potatoes, and the deep fried seafood plate. The baba ghanouj had an amazing charcoal flavor, which was elevated by the pomegranate seeds, lemon, and mint leaves. We sopped up every last bit of the dip with the warm pita bread, and was still craving more! The spicy potatoes reminded me of breakfast potatoes in the US, but I did like how crispy they were without being greasy. They also had a delicious spicy seasoning that made it unique. The seafood plate is also a great deal, with calamari, shrimp, smelt, and eggplant that had a light fry on it. I loved that it was paired with a yogurt dip that cut the grease and heaviness of a deep-fried dish.Next, I had the chicken shawarma, which was a little disappointing. The chicken was a little dry and salty enough to keep me chugging water for hours after the meal. I loved the basmati rice though, which was fragrant and fluffy. My brother had the shish taouk, which was marinated chicken breast cubes on a skewer. His meat looked much more tender and well-cooked than mine, so if you're looking for a chicken dish I recommend this one instead! My parents both had the sea bass, but were doubtful about whether the fish really was sea bass. It was lightly pan-fried, then covered with a delicious tomato sauce. I really appreciated the freshness of the ingredients, but the food had a few missteps along the way that took away from the meal as a whole.",

    "text": "Of all the foods across the globe, Lebanese is by far my favourite cuisine. I love the fact that you can order lots of different plates of food which can be shared amongst friends, allowing you to nibble a bit of this and that - and importantly allowing you not to get food envy across the table!I headed down to Yalla Yalla, located just behind Oxford Street on Monday evening for a catch up with an old work colleague. I arrived a little earlier, and as guests aren't seated until the whole party arrives, sat down to wait for my companion at the bar whilst enjoying a glass of apple, mint and ginger lemonade and taking in my surroundings.The vibe of the restaurant is very noisy and lively, owing to the fact that you sit on long communal tables (think Wagamamas/Flesh & buns) so it makes it a great place to socialise in big groups. Once we were seated, we got ahead with ordering a selection of dishes to share, which arrive as they are cooked rather all at the same time - for this reason I didn't get a snap of some of the dishes as I was too busy scoffing to remember!'Tabboule' \u00a0- my go-to Lebanese dish a salad comprised of chopped parsley, mint, spring onion, tomato, olive oil, lemon juice and cracked wheat. A little lacking in in lemon juice- the best tabuloueh, for me, packs a real zing!'Halloum meshoue' - chunks of grilled halloumi cheese served with with tomato, black olives, fresh mint dressed in olive oil.Hommos - deliciously creamy and very moreish!The Chicken Rakakat (delicious fragrant fried pastry filled with marinated chicken, garlic and harrisa) were the star of the show and the Falafel served with tahini and garlic youghurt sauce were moist and delicious. \u00a0Sadly these were devoured before I got the chance to photograph them - but I can vouch for how delicious they are! All the above, plus two drinks came to \u00a315 each which I think is great value - highly recommend if you're looking for an informal lunch or dinner venue!",

A friend and I booked at table on a weekday for 6pm - \u00a0a very small restaurant (a bit cramped feeling) there didn't seem any need to book however by 6.30 it was pretty full! Although the main dishes look amazing (particularly interested in trying LAMB SHAWARMA - Grilled thin slices of marinated lamb, grilled tomato, sumac and parsley onion salad with basmati vermicelli rice & KASTALETA - Charcoal grilled marinated lamb cutlets with grilled \u00a0baby aubergine, spring onion and red pepper puree) we opted for the mezze to share so we could try plenty of dishes! We went for 5 dishes; baba ghannouj, ,mince lamb parcels, feta and halloumi parcels, sauteed potatoes and chicken parcels along with a bottle of Lebanon white. EVERYTHING was delicious. Impressed with baba ghannouj and the white. I can't remember the cost however not unreasonable but not great value. Service was good. I will definitely be back!",

Someone had told me about this place before and I really wanted to like it.I do like the decor, and I like that they have some sandwiches on display. But I don't like much else.We made our order and were waiting for it to come out. The sandwich was on display and just needed to be heated. It took a good 15 minutes for them to heat and wrap 4 sandwiches. They also rudely asked us to wait outside as we were crowding them. The staff was generally rude, as when I asked about other items they had, they were rude and told me that what's on display was all they had left. I understand that it was late and might be the end of their work day, but it wouldn't kill them to be nicer.Then the sandwich: dry meat, very underwhelming. Maybe they are better as table service? I don't know.",

The salad is refreshing and light, featuring mint and cucumbers and a light balsamic. It's a great way to start off the meal.We ordered a fish, a lamb, and a chicken plate. Each came with rice, bread, and pickled vegetables. Everything was delicious! The chicken was definitely my favorite. You can tell how freshly made everything is and how good the produce they use is.

For this price point you get a lot of atmosphere. Super cute cafe with real decor and nice staff.Hubby and I grabbed a mana'eesh lamb which was tasty - 4 slices of bread with a thin spread of lamb on top, covered with slices of red onion, pomegranates and pomegranate molasses. But it was definitely more of snack than a meal. It came with some pita bread which was not that good. We also got some arabica coffee - a turkish style coffee - which was really nice and strong. *** pro tip: though there are menus on the table they have a huge chalkboard wall of take-away wraps. Sadly we didn't notice this in time.If you're looking for a place in Soho to chill out it's pretty good. There was someone working on their laptop the entire time.",

Luckily they have a few stools and tables outside.However I ordered a sojcou wrap which was Lebanese spicy sausage with tzatiki and salad. However this place lost a star because I thought the wrap would be made after the sausages was heated. Then salad and tzatiki would be added before rolling. No it wasn't! I hate warmed yoghurt with cooked salad.... I don't make it at home like that. Anyway I will order something else next time as the mezzes looked so tasty! Just do it properly next time! \u00a0The menu is based upon Lebanese cuisine and ideal for sharing.",

She was very knowledgeable and gave a very good decription of the mezze suggestions that she made, including what goes into it and how they were cooked. I was brought some lovely pickled green chilies and radish, along with juicy olives and fresh pitta bread to began with. Baba gannouj and the tabboul\u00e9 arrived not long after. With a garnish of little pomegranate seed jewels and slivers of fresh mint, the baba gannouj are a pretty thing to look at. It is lightly tangy, smoky and have the creamiest texture and yet hidden within are surprising tiny bites of soft aubergines, the textures is just sensational and utterly addictive. The tabboul\u00e9 is vividly flavoured and so fresh. All the green-tasting herbs are just beautifully balanced, crisp, crunchy and are just a joy to eat. The sawda djal arrived just as I was still savouring with a mouthful of the herby greens. This is definitely without a doubt, the best chicken liver dish I have ever tasted. It was rich, gutsy, and well flavoured. The sweet-sour balance from the homemade pomegranate molasses were simply tantalising. It was so good that I had to mop up every single drop of the remaining sauce with the pitta bread. The samboussek lahm\u00e9 that looked like small versions of Cornish pasty arrived piping hot. A quick bite revealed a richly spiced minced lamb in a crispy pastry. The sweet and sharp once again were well balanced and make this a truly deletable and moreish treat. All these were nicely washed down with some superb Lebanese beer. The whole meal came to about \u00a320, including a bottle of beer. A bargain for this amount of food. I was stuffed by the end of it with some leftover. Everything were sincerely and freshly prepared. The venue may be small \u00a0my table were nearly knocked over by a diner on his way to the restroom, but the flavours of the food were big and punchy. The Lebanese music in the background also added to the charm of this place \u00a0although there was a Lebanese version of Summertime playing on the soundtrack while dining. Well at least it was in Lebanese. If you want to experience true Lebanese food in London, this is definitely the place to go to and with their current plan to open a third venue in King's Cross soon. I am pretty sure that they will soon be on every true foodie's must go list. Yalla! Yalla!",

I found myself dousing everything with Harissa. \u00a0What I thought would be a pastry stuffed with lamb was a kind of bread topped with crumbles of lamb.

We order just 5 mezze and it was really more than enough food. The halloum is great! Very tender and not as salty as the ones you get from grocery stores. The kibbe Lahme which is minced lamb with cracked wheat is trying as well. Oh and they also have fresh watermelon juice!

Onion side salad with shawarma was too basic pH - wise and stung. Service was sporadic near closing time and the grill ran out of charcoal. Would go back.",

    "text": "Truly tasty food at very reasonable prices. From other reviews I gather my statement above is par for the course. What seems to let Yalla Yalla down (according to those lucky enough to have eaten here) has usually been the service; with servers even being described as rude. We decided to take our chances earlyish on Saturday evening. Being earlyish there were two vacant tables plus quite a few diners coming to the end of their meals and therefore the opportunity to move to a better table. The young waiter who served us was just perfect. However, when 3 tables magically vacated at the same time just as our mains were coming out we decided to 'upgrade' to one of the better tables. Female waitress was having none of this and informed us that all 3 tables were reserved for a big party. Stupidly we did not ask what time the reservation was for. Imagine our chagrin, therefore, as another table of three walk- INS were allowed to use the one table as long as they finished up by seven, yet another walk-in of two people were allowed to occupy the third table (also being informed of the 7 o'clock time limit). Finally another couple entered and were offered a choice of the third table ( if vacated by 7) or another. By now we had finished our mains and were onto deserts and coffees . . . so could easily, easily have occupied anyone of the three better tables. We left before the reservation arrived, much miffed, but still tipped our waiter very well. Hope he doesn't have to share his tips with the inflexible female waitress as that would seem unfair. The other female waitress had little to do with us but I did see her flick her wrist in a very rude way to other customers. She didn't seem to have customer service top of mind. Will we rush back? Sadly, I doubt this will become a favorite haunt because of the bad taste left in our mouths. There are many good restaurants in London where our Pounds can be spent more deservedly. With hindsight we should have asked when the reservation was for and then either sttod our ground or left without finishing our mains.",

Actually all of the dishes Larissa and I ordered were pretty yummy. A little greasy (but what do you expect from street food) yet yummy.We decided to go here as it was rated so highly on Yelp, and yes I agree with the others but I'm a harsh marker. It's also hidden between the not so secret sex shops of Soho, making it a somewhat intimidating search for non locals, this actually plays to it's advantage, making it a hidden hot pot for a great lunch out. We had the tapas style dishes but I have to say, there was a tasty looking selection of wraps and juices up for grabs too.",

    "text": "Down Green Ct, one of Soho's attractive sex streets, there's a beacon of shining... yellow and orange and red. In this place is Yalla Yalla, which means \"fast fast\".The food is simple Lebanese street food, and done fairly well. There's a whole array of takeaway as well as a few tables.The GoodThe food is simple and, actually, top quality. The baba ghannoush was silky, buttery, flavourful, and loaded. The hummous, while I prefer it thick, was creamy and delicious. Kibbeh was spiced enough to bring out the lamb, not the spice. Prawns were cooked the right amount- and the shell came away cleanly. Fattoush was not overwhelming, crisp, fresh vegetables and not too acidic.The bright, clean decor was a pleasure to eat and drink in. The tables were really cool looking, if perhaps the stools were a bit short, and the curious arrangement of logs as legs meant that you had a really awkward leg positioning to get in and out, and you couldn't shuffle around on those too-short stools. My bum was aching, even the next day.I would recommend the lebanese wine. The most expensive one, at \u00a323, was eminently drinkable with hints of subtle flavours, though not overpowering the food in the least- pleasurable, fruit-forward flavours without being jammy, with a hint of old-world spice hovering underneath.The BadThe aforementioned tables and stools were rather uncomfortable- especially if you were lingering over a last few glasses of wine on a date. The service, while competent, was to be honest, just barely so, considering our meal, no pudding, with wine was about \u00a360- although we did probably overdo it a bit.The biggest problem, however, was the takeaway counter- it's not really separate, in fact, it's just the counter where the local punters used to buy their porn over, and it sits right by about 1/3 of the diner's heads. Combine this with the fact that it's creakingly overloaded with Lavash wrapped around succulent food, right at my head height, and it felt like I was being watched during my whole meal by Falafel-in-lavash and filo dough. The counter is, unfortunately, just too narrow for these trays filled with their takeaway, and I was afraid that I was going to rub the side of my head on them.So?I'd go back, though. The food was really rather special. I'd be more likely to stumble in after a few pints than to take a date, however- unless it was my new date from the few pints.Ultimately, I think Yalla Yalla can't decide if it's upscale or downscale- Yes, YY, there is profit in downscale, but you could raise the prices by 50p and have a proper lovely hole in the wall special place for those \"in the know\"...",

While the side street is located in a 'colourful' area of Soho, Yalla Yalla is pleasantly decorated and warm inside.The menu is typically Middle Eastern. I didn't spot anything advertised as being specifically from Beirut.However, the zingy salads and meat stews are packed with flavour. If your have a sweet tooth, the baklava looked moreish.Worth a look but don't let Google Streetcar catch you heading down a small side alley in Soho!",

All of the meze we ordered to share (and we ordered A LOT) was fantastic! Nothing was overly greasy. The only item we didn't devour was the batata harra - it was nothing to write home about. Favorite dish was the 'samboussek lahme'. This is a great place to go for a casual late dinner and night out in Soho.",

But it just gave us more time to savor the lamb kaftas - soft pita with lots of tender lamb - and halloum. \u00a0The spicy sauce made the meal. \u00a0I have no idea what's in it but it was like ordering a side of complimentary crack - the stuff was highly addictive, so much so that my friend asked to buy some. \u00a0Not for sale unfortunately but they gave her a takeout container of it free of charge (I suspect she may have eaten it with a spoon as soon as she got home). \u00a0Definitely worth checking out.",

Some of the best of this kind of food I have had. Service was slow and when we got the bill the woman who served us, she \u00a0would not take American Express even though it said so on the door they accepted it. Not a big deal but just be aware. There is no reservation system as the place is small and always busy. So in summary, excellent food which was worth the wait and go in a couple, our you will be waiting a long time unless you go after 8pm or so.",

I was impressed by the simple decor, straightforward menu and well executed dishes.I would recommend the fattoush salad to start which flows nicely into the lamb casserole. I certainly wouldn't have ordered a dish listed as a casserole (I like my Lebanese schwarma), but I'm happy that I split it with my dining companion. The meat was wonderful and well complimented by the pistachios.I'll be back, soon...I hope that I'll see some Yelpers there!",
