The place looks great too with an original choice of green for the chairs, and a nice collection of venitian mirrors that makes the who restaurant stand out as somewhere funky and elegant. A great place for a London dinner, be it with friends, your loved one or for business. Note that it is open till late, unfortunately on the expensive side.",

It's a place where one can run into 'heavies' - and not just one account of the size of their wallets. But go for some sublime dishes - the tagliolini verdi gratinati comes immediately to mind - and superlative Italian wines - like the Sforza I had last time. You will leave much poorer than when you came in - but it's worth it",

I've never had a bad experience here and have been going for years. Great breakfast menu, and perfect for business meetings in the area throughout the day as it's very discreet. One of my favourite places is by the bar though, wonderful atmosphere and great reasonably priced drinks and I'd recommend a bellini, and all the drinks come with nuts and a large dish of olives. Its iconic plus green interior is very comfortable and it has an area of banquettes that are perfect for more intimates dinner. A wonderful all-rounder that has stood the test of time. I would however recommend booking in advance, especially for main meals.",

With J in tow, I dashed down the street and through its doors. Suffice it to say, I needed a dirty martini. Bad.After we checked our coats with the friendly hostess, we perched ourselves at the marble bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender who asked us what we'd like to wet our whistle. In addition to placing our drink orders, we also picked a few snacks from their menu: meatballs and the platter of Italian cured meats. Why, yes, we were hungry. Why do you ask?But back to Cecconi's, it definitely has an ambiance from another era: the waiters are wearing white coats and black ties, little round cafe tables spot the restaurant inside and out and there's a quiet hum of chatter and silverware. Definitely a great spot for a drink after work or a spot of shopping given Regents Street is one block away. And to us, a very welcome find on a cold, rainy evening.",

    "text": "I'm a pretty big fan of Cecconis. \u00a0First decided to go a while back because I walk by it almost every day, and it seems to be packed 24/7 - even at nontraditional meal times like between 3 and 5pm mid week, with lots of people standing around the bar but also sitting down and eating. I know that busy does not always mean good, but I just don't see how \u00a0a place can be so consistently rammed and not be at least above average! Plus the crowd looked pretty good - well dressed women of all ages (25 to 80 years old, not kidding) then sophisticated looking men. Went in with my parents for dinner and sat at the bar and asked for their most popular dishes which were the lobster spaghetti and the veal canelloni. Both did not disappoint. \u00a0Another feature I enjoyed is that you can order most of the pastas in small or large sizes, for instance, the small canelloni has two pasta strips, while the larger has 3. \u00a0Have now been in multiple times with my parents and boyfriend. \u00a0I usually stick with the lobster spaghetti or the veal. \u00a0Definitely prefer it for lunch and dinner over brunch. \u00a0The brunch food is nothing special. \u00a0For instance, the Eggs Benedicts don't come with sides, and the pancake is literally just 1 small-ish pancake on a plate all on its own! Can be pretty busy in the after works drinks time slot so if you want to get a seat at the bar (which is quite nice for two people) I'd recommend not going between 5 and 7pm. \u00a0Thursday seems to be the busiest night.",

I can always recommend a few other Italian restuarants in London alone and this restaurant will not be on my list.Soft shell crab - badly presented (I seriously thought it was moving) and it was pretty hard (was it sitting out in the cold for a while or did they reheated it?). I didn't enjoy this dish at all.Selection of crostinia and bruschetta - some of them were too oily but others were good.Royal sea bream, spinach - This was value for money as it was a whole sea bream, pretty good size. Make sure you ask them to debone the fish, although there were still some bones left in the fish. This is quite a messy dish once the waiter deboned the fish but at least it's fresh.Tiramisu - highly recommended. Out of this world.If you want to go for the experience, then give it a go. Otherwise try somewhere else.",

    "text": "This appears to be one of the places to be seen in Mayfair and it's usually necessary to make a reservation but if like me you can get there early on a Saturday or Sunday, and I mean about 8.00, you can usually get a table while the place fills with London's beautiful people. Real leaf tea served by starched Italian waiters and a really fantastic Eggs Benedict make it one of my favourite places to eat breakfast in London. If, like me, you like a cigar, there are tables outside so you can enjoy a stogie after your breakfast as you watch the world go by and popping in later in the day to sit at one of the green leather bar stools for a reviving prosecco will make you feel like a reel high roller.",

I've been wanting to go here for a long time so being treated twice in a week was double whammy of brilliance for me- or so I thought!The food was... disappointing. I had the oxtail papardelle on my first visit- with a side dish of fried zuccini. Both of these dishes were good, but the papardelle was a little on the cold side and I would have preferred a little more ragu! On my second visit- I started with a crab ravioli- alarmingly for such a smart restaurant 2 out of 3 of my raviolis had crab shell in them. My main course was a butternut squash risotto. I love risotto- but this one was lumpy, slightly overdone and lacked punch in terms of flavour. So far, not so good. I finished with a chocolate pudding, as my spoon entered its side it erupted with chocolate, oozing over my plate- much like the pudding in the m&S advert- it was accompanied by pistachio ice cream- which sadly didn't taste very much of pistachio. Highs and lows, but the highs just weren't good enough considering the setting, ambiance and high esteem the restaurant is given. Sad to say it, but Cecconi's did not live up to my expectations.",

Service is prompt, reserved and no fuss - and let's face it, you're faking it to be there, so the less questions asked the better. Unavoidably, you will have to navigate the incessant queue and questioning from Abercrombie & Fitch groupies who loiter and snake around the corner like a seeping sore in Mayfair.

It is a good restaurant, but there is a bit of the \"trying too hard\" element at work. We had just arrived in London from several days on the coast in Cornwall and were tired and in need of good food. We couldn't get anyone to answer the phone to make a reservation so we walked over and asked if they could fit us in. \u00a0She said she could, but it would be more than 2 hours (it was early around 7:30) and there were numerous tables empty. We saw seats at the bar and found out they served dinner there. Perfect! \u00a0We love eating at the bar. And it was, for the most part, great. \u00a0But many of those empty tables were still empty when we left, nearly 2 hours later. It reeks of the kind of place that would rather turn you away than admit they were taking walk-ins on a Saturday night. \u00a0Fortunately Francesco, bartender/waiter saved the day. He was attentive, helpful and good at what he does. We ordered starters. Husband had meatballs which he labeled bland and not interesting. I had the chicken liver pate crostini which was good. \u00a0The liver could have had more seasoning, but the carmelized onions on top made up for the shortcomings of the pate. They were outstanding. For mains I had the organic salmon with salad. It was well cooked. The salad was a wee overdressed. My husband had Tagliatelle with clams and botargo which he declared excellent. \u00a0Definitely would order it again. \u00a0Dessert, I had the Tiramisu which was good but nothing to write home to mother about. \u00a0My husband had pistachio ice cream but a single serve was about the size of the sorbet palette cleanser they used to serve between courses. \u00a0Price. \u00a0Hmmmm. \u00a0It was overpriced. \u00a0I was having a vodka tonics, which were 10.50 in pounds equalling $19.50 US. \u00a0A bit much. \u00a0It isn't a bad place. \u00a0There are just a lot of places who do that kind of thing much better.Would I go back? \u00a0Probably not. \u00a0But I might just to sit at the bar and enjoy a grossly overpriced drink at the bar with Francesco -- and to watch the people watching each other.",

We did not have a reservation and they did not seat us at one of the many empty tables. I enjoy sitting at the bar usually but this bar was crowded and tough to eat at. The tables surrounding us remained empty the entire evening for which I removed one star from an otherwise three star review. Okay meal but not worth returning.",

    "text": "OK. Two words to describe my early supper at Cecconi's. LOVED IT! I've always walked past this curious place and wondered what the food was like, as it was always packed with an odd crowd of young and old. But hey it's Italian, so a no brainer for me!So finally I decided to book an early dins with a friend as we had to go off to 'Gin and Jazz' at the Intercontinental later and weren't sure if there were eats there (there was as it happens but it was very 'meaty' and 'sushiesque'!). Online booking was a bust with no availability, but the website says if you call them they set aside a few tables for last minute people. Ha...I dialled thinking a) I'd never get through b) it was an urban myth. They answered the phone promptly and saved me an excellent table by the window. BIG tick of approval there!My friend Apes was pleased I booked there as she often gets taken for power breakfast briefings there but had never been for an evening meal. And boy did they deliver. They brought over an excellent range of complimentary breads and olive oil to nibble on. Like Bocca Di Lupo the all day menu format can be traditional starter, main and dessert. But I recommend small sharing plates (Cichetti). We went for quail eggs, mushroom aracini, breaded mozzarella (sounds a bit 'Iceland' tacky - but tasted ace) and a main it had to be risotto - squash and castelmagno, a Piedmont cheese. Portion was massive and I couldn't finish it. Friend had the ravioli which were tasty. Knocked back a couple of glasses of Prosecco and the bill was under a \u00a3100 including service. Service was phenomenal IMHO - you go to the bathroom (Cowshed soap and moisturiser, natch - as Cecconi's is part of the Soho House group) and return to find your napkin neatly folded by the waitress. Additional bread and water brought without fuss and efficiently. Room was busy but had just the right 'vibe' of bustle but liveliness that makes a restaurant in to destination dining.Yup I think I've found my regular haunt in the heart of the West End...And now I understand why it's always busy night and day.",

It took nearly 30 minutes to get our bottle of prosecco. We were through our first glass before our server took our dinner order, which surprisingly we weren't eleven asked if we would like a starter or salad. Maybe that's just the American expectation in me. Appetizer of beef carpaccio came out quickly. It was not sliced as thin as a typical carpaccio and the olive oil added nothing to it. Loaded with pepper it was bearable.Dinner - sea bass and asparagus. The asparagus was huge which means woody. They didn't shave it, so it was tough to get down. Sea bass - much to be desired. Dessert - score! Blood orange panacotta. Out of this world. Very firm texture, incredible vanilla flavor, top sprinkled with vanilla bean. The service was so impersonal. I would return for drinks at the bar, but not for dinner.",

It felt like somewhere straight out of Sex And The City - a classy and lively crowd, with green leather banquettes and smartly dressed waiters.After a while though, the bustle soon became a bit too much - we realised that for all the serving staff rushing backwards and forwards it was very difficult to get anyone's attention to order. The tables are all crammed a little too close together, making it difficult for the waiters to reach everyone, and combined with the number of people waiting for a table by the door (and hence near our table) it all got a bit claustrophobic.The food is well-executed at least and tasted very fresh and flavourful, though you'd hope so for \u00a315 a pasta dish. 2-stars is on the harsh side but I think it was all just a little lost on me - I'm sure Carrie and the girls would've been impressed with a swish meal here on a visit from NYC but there's just too many other options in this price bracket for me to come back.",

The sausage appetizer was tasty but notez bien que the side sausages on the other hand are bland and overlooked. The few who ordered from the lunch menu (sea bass and a pasta dish) were pleased. The desserts saved the day as well. Vanilla cheesecake, creme caramel and chocolat fondant were all divine. Americano coffee was too bitter but the cappuccino was nice.SERVICEFew gripes with service as well:Staff was very friendly but...Our party was seated at the wrong table and had to be moved.I ordered a mimosa and never got it.

    "text": "Seriously good pappardelle pasta with lamb and artichoke ragu. I was expecting more pretentiousness, smaller portions, and higher prices but was pleasantly surprised on all fronts. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and I found the service to be very friendly and professional. On a last minute whim (9:20 PM), I made a reservation here on recommendation from the concierge at The Stafford - it started as a table for 2 at 10 PM and soon changed to a table for 4, and by the time we arrived there were 5 us. The hostess didn't bat an eyelash and we were easily accommodated.The pasta and the dessert were the standouts for the evening. The only slight service downside was the fact that everyone kept reminding us how late it was and that the kitchen was closing / running out of items. But I still don't care - great, great food!",

It sounds plain yet it was bursting with flavor. My daughter had truffle targliete which you had to ask for. \u00a0Definitely a big portion for lunch and plenty of people watching going on. \u00a0Manager checked on us during lunch and as we were leaving. \u00a0We were extremely pleased with our choice.",
