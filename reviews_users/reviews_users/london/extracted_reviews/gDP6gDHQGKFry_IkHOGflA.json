    "text": "Me and my friends, partially drunk, were staggering around Russell Square hungry as hell. A friend of my friend worked at a pub (in fact, his dad owned it) So we went there to try and find some grub. \u00c2\u00a310.00 for some fish and chips? Nowhere to sit? Packed pub? No thanks. Had a pint but we kindly made our excuses and tottered off and found this place. The Hare and Tortoise? I thought that it must have been a pub food type of place. How wrong I was.A queue? For a restaurant? Welcome to London. It is the first time I have ever had to do this.. normally I turn up and there are seats available. But not here! The wait was only ten minutes though and alcohol had smoothed over any friction I might have felt otherwise. We even let an older pair of couples go before us to be seated because we were feeling so amiable. Finally though, we got to our seats. The fun started here! The food was excellently affordable and before my food came (stir fried beef in black bean sauce) I was skeptical about my portion size but I was delighted with what I got. A large bowl equally distributed between delicious rice and delicious stir fry. The service for me was enjoyable (some Japanese waitress kept coming over to speak to us... probably my good looks) and they were very helpful, despite the business. I would advocate this place to all, even if you aren't necessarily in the area. There are other branches at other parts of London though so look out for them if you don't live near EC1!",

Being in school just two minutes away meant I could beat the rush and enjoy their food in peace. I've had almost everything vegetarian on their menu, and believe it is scrumptious and so reasonably priced. Why then am I not giving it a 5 star? The service!!! Sometimes rude, often times inadequate and more often than not indifferent. Their management of queues and people waiting is terrible. Hence, if you can make it on a weekday before 6.30 or after 8.30 or for lunch after 1.30. That's when the place is empty and the service is tolerable. I would still say it is a must go, I've been in Boston for almost a year now, and can still remember the \u00a0taste of their sushi :)",

The decor is plain and lingering doesn't really seem to be encouraged, but this is the kind of place you have a good chat with a colleague or acquaintance and then get up, out, and on to the next square of a busy day (now fortified with delicious noodles or rice in your belly!).",

This put me off coming here for a long time even though the Bloomsbury branch is close to my office. Of their offerings, I prefer their soup noodles to their stir-fried noodles. In particular, I like the curry laksa (\u00a36.25), which is generously topped with chicken, fried tofu, prawn, squid, and fish cake. Although this was a different variant to one I had at Kiasu, I thought the laksa here was superior. In contrast, my take-away yaki udon (\u00a36) was a bit lacklustre. Whilst it was good value and chock full of roast pork, squid, prawn, and crabstick, it lacked quality. The presence of crabstick was puzzling but I was more disappointed by the lack of garnish, such as pickled ginger and spicy fish powder that normally accompany Japanese fried noodles. Whilst Hare & Tortoise may lack a bit of quality, it's much better (and cheaper) than Wagamama. Overall a decent good value option for noodles, if you find yourself in the vicinity of one. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.\u2026",

    "text": "This place serves a variety of Asian food. The quality is decent, but not great. The dishes have a very standard presentation, as if they came off a conveyor belt. The main drawback, however, is that this place is always overcrowded and noisy, being filled with students from nearby universities. This is bound to happen, given that it's one of the few full scale restaurants in the area. The impression you get from the staff is that they want you to finish your meal as soon as possible and leave to make room for more people. It's generally ok for lunch if you are in that area, but certainly isn't worth queuing outside for half an hour in the evening or deliberately traveling here from somewhere else. People say it's value for money and they're probably right, but, in my opinion, I would rather spend much more and get the food and the service of excellent standard that I deserve.",

    "text": "The Hare & Tortoise predates the Brunswick centre's gentrification, previously being on the opposite side of the Renoir cinema, always popular with Asian students in London. With the general makeover the Hare & Tortoise has changed too, and now has more seats than before. They have also added sushi to the menu which whilst decent enough I generally avoid for the more comforting main dishes. I usually go for the Tori Katsu curry with Chinese greens, which particularly seems to do the trick when hungover. Although, it's important to mention that the gyoza are also really tasty.As was mentioned the queues can get pretty crazy and the service can be a little moody. Still it's great value and really fulfilling food.",

Portions are big (maybe even huge), especially its noodles (though it might be the huge bowls giving me an illusion of extra size). And they go for about 5 to 7 pounds only. My favourite dish here is definitely the curry mee, which is very rich (the soup) and they don't skimp on the garnishings. It can get very full in the evenings after 6 or 6.30pm, so make sure you get there early or be ready to queue for a while. It's generally a short wait if you're a pair or at most 4 people. Any more than that will take forever if you attempt to try your luck.",

Waitstaff needs significant amount of training in customer service -- they especially need to learn to wait until their customers finish eating before taking the plate / bowl away. \u00a0I understand it's a small restaurant and it's crowded and they just want to clear the tables to get new customers in, but they also need to remember that their tips are dependent on their level of service. \u00a0I typically give 15% tips at most sit-down restaurants in London, but at this place, I usually give less than 10% if at all.*** TIP: \u00a0They charge for tea, so just order hot water. \u00a0It's ridiculous that they even charge for tea. There are better places out there, but if you're stuck in Bloomsbury and need a fix to your pan-Asian cuisine cravings, the Hare & Tortoise at this location will do.",

    "text": "4 stars solely based on value rather than merely on food quality.An absolute institution for students (particularly Asian ones), I used to frequent H&T when at UCL. During peak meal times you can expect to queue for at least 20 minutes before getting a seat. Fortunately they do take-out, so if you're in a hurry you can just head inside and order at the cashier.Food:It's all pretty reliable. The sort of thing I'd score at a 3-3.5. Their katsu curry is solid, likewise for their laksa. The char kuay teow deserves special mention imo because it's actually objectively good rather than just good for London.Their sushi/sashimi is all decent. Similar price to atari-ya but marginally worse in quality. Basically don't come here just for that (go to atari-ya instead)What makes H&T stand out is the value. Mains are around 6-8 pounds each and the portions are obscenely large. I think the best representation of this is the fact that the tempura udon (~7 pounds) is quite a decent portion on its own at the price. But because it's comparatively smaller than the other dishes, for that price point you get some sushi on the side as well.Bottom line - far from the best asian food you'll have but a combination of decent qualify, decent pricing, and massive portions make this incredibly good value for money.",

Sushi is not only gross, but grossly overpriced.Hare & Tortoise, however, does sushi better (and at vastly better prices) than lots of big sushi chains. The queue out the door is always miles long but the service is so fast you don't ever end up waiting that long. The other thing I love about this place is that although the service is quick, you never feel as though you're being rushed. The staff are super-friendly and attentive but not pushy.Aside from sushi, they do some very nice asian dishes (and the complaints in other reviews about the food not being spicy enough doesn't bother me, not being a big fan of 'spicy').

And I'm a big fan of the green gook, but this was way too much. I felt like a west hollywood adult movie star on a coke binge the stuff was so strong. So have them take the white stuff out of the salad before they serve you (consider yourself warned).The spicy tuna maki was meh... have had so much better... so maybe I'm spoiled. I dunno'. It wasn't spicy enough (I know, the irony.... it's killing me). Go figure.The south african white they have by the glass (4.50 for a large one), is pretty decent btw.Atmosphere is meh... the food is meh... the staff are inattentive. Not really my favorite place.

For me, I prefer better quality, and so won't be returning.",

So you you can go and dine blindly at any time lunch/dinner until 11 pm. For dinner, you might notice the long lining up outside H&T, but that does not mean you are gonna Wait that long. The only meaning is that there is a great food waiting for you inside. So don't get scared of the long lining up. All there food is great, I love prawns spring rolls, King Prawns fried rice (massive portion, comes with miso \u00a0soup), Carry Laksa (cool), Been and black beans (awesome). They also serve nice fresh apple etc juices too, which is not very normal in busy restaurants. Sushi, did I say the word sushi, because I'm a Sushi-hater :S the whole concept is not for me. But believe it or not, This place made me re-think sushi again :D I'm starting to love it , esp the Dragon Rolls (Cool). The service there is not bad at all, bearing in mind the big crowd they got all day long. And to be honest H&T is not a place to relax in at all, it is rather a battle with good food full stop! So, if you have not tried this place yet, you should",

Little did we know that the table would take over 1 hour! On a Tuesday night, for 5 people! Everytime I asked the host how long, he said \"5\" minutes, This was the longest 5 minutes I've ever wait for poorly done meal and underwhelming sushi.I will agree with the past reviewers that the meal is quite a value, but not considering what is available elsewhere in the city. The noodles here were poorly seasoned and the best part of my meals here were the appetizers. This is never a good sign. The sushi was over-dressed and lacked any fresh or zestful taste. There are better places for noodle bowls, but if you're craving just a vegetable tempura platter then head here. The wait will make you hungry enough that any food the present to you will seem delicious at the time. Unless you order the sushi that is ;)",

It is better to nip in either a little early or very late. The food is great, really filling. My personal favorite is Curry Laksa, a huge bowl of thick spicy soup and various meat and vegetables. Though, apart from the Ramen, which having lived in Japan for three years and slurped my way through the real deal on a regular basis, I found a bit tasteless, everything I have tried there has been fantastic. The one weakness is the indifferent service, and saying indifferent is being complimentary. The problem with popularity is that the staff are trying to churn through as many customers as possible. The good thing about this is that they are fast and efficient, the bad thing is that you feel obliged to run out the door as soon as you have finished.",

I must ocnfess i have only strayed from that offering once ro twice, always to return.

What thoroughly detracts from the experience, on a regular basis, is not only the queue outside the restaurant - this is seen by some to be proof of the goodness of the food served - but the sheer indifference of some staff members. As previously suggested in several reviews, if you can time your visit right, this place would rate more like a \u00a04-star experience. I highly recommend the Curry Laksa and Prawn Mee - both made for those with a good tolerance for spices. The large portions mean that you get to savour the dishes all the way through to your satiety. Their Beef Chill & Black Bean Lo Mein is wicked and designed to please. There are several items on the menu I have tried and liked and I'm quite sure that I'll keep going back there, despite the service, for the food!",

    "text": "We stumbled across this restaurant during the Christmas holiday period several years ago, when most other businesses were closed. We haven't looked back since. The restaurant is situated in the thriving Brunswick Centre which is host to a plethora of eateries and retail shops. Due to the popularity of this restaurant (especially at lunch time) you are often greeted with a line of eager customers queuing outside for a table. Parking can be expensive and problematic in terms of finding spaces. There is an underground station only 2 minutes away (Russell Square) and Holborn station is around a 20 minute walk. The interior and decor is a little tired-looking and the tables are very closely situated next to each other which can prove a little intrusive on your personal space while eating. The toilets are situated in the basement and require a fair walk down a grimy metal staircase, you could be forgiven for thinking you are going down into part of the London Dungeons expecting to find a torture chamber for non-paying customers :)(Most) of the staff are very friendly, welcoming and tentative, they are very efficient at their jobs and your food arrives freshly cooked in what seems like minutes. My only criticism, would be that you do feel rather rushed to finish, especially at busy times when the queue is going half-way round the block. The eagle-eyed staff will swoop down and collect your empty bottle or bowl/plate, even if others on the table are still eating. You are then asked if you would like anything else in a - 'could you please hurry up as we need the table' - kind of a way. Ah...the food, yes. Although primarily with the title of a 'Noodle Bar' restaurant, The Hare and Tortoise has an excellent range of freshly-made Sushi. The quality is excellent and is on par, if not better than the likes of Yo! Sushi. The menu is not vast in its food choices, but every single item on that menu has been carefully chosen for its uniqueness and flavour. All the starters are mouthwatering and moorish. Try the prawn dumplings!I would highly recommend the 'Curry Laksa' it is to-die-for. I cannot put into words the explosion of flavours and variety of content within the dish to give it justice. It's like a party in your mouth. :)My family and I frequent this restaurant monthly and although we have tried other dishes on the menu, (all of which have been fantastic) we always seem to go for the Curry Laksa - It almost doesn't 'feel' right visiting the Hare and Tortoise and NOT having the Laksa, which we have named as their signature dish. It's quite amusing actually, on our way there, we all agree to try something different from the menu and we have all the good will in the world to try something new, but when we are sat down and the waiter(tress) comes over its Curry Laksa all round! \u00a0Well, It's a bit like going to a swimming pool and not getting wet! You just can't do it!!The chicken Katsu Curry is worth a mention too, it's panko-covered chicken in a thick curry sauce on a bed of boiled rice, a hearty and warming dish if you are feeling cold and hungry. Anyway, I digress, enough with the analogies, just have the Curry Laksa, OK?Just one more thing to note, the size of the dishes are 'one (Big) meal' size, therefore, you pick one main dish as a meal, don't get carried away ordering several dishes thinking its like a standard Chinese restaurant, as you WILL be eating for hours and taking home several 'doggie-bags'. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough, (for its food) and if we lived more locally to its address, we would probably eat there 3-4 times a week.",

Verdict? This was just okay. Nothing special. My friend and I ordered some sort of salad and pork dumplings beforehand which were really nice, but overall it is not the kind of place I would go to again in a hurry.",

    "text": "This location of the Japanese food chain in nestled in the corner of Brunswick Square, a fairly busy shopping plaza with no shortage of shops and restaurants. The interior is clean cut and well lit, with smooth wooden tables and comfortable seating.The Hare and Tortoise's menu is extensive and comes in several parts: noodles, rice, nigiri, maki, sushi boxes, sashimi, donburi, drinks, and dessert, as well as being very reasonably priced (a noodle or rice dish could set you back 6 to 12 quid, depending on what you choose to get). You'd find your standard chicken teriyaki boxes and your unagi boxes, but you' also find other Asian dishes, such as char kway teow and fried rice. Overall, it's a pretty standard pan-Asian menu leaning more towards the Japanese.The sushi box that my three friends shared came speedily, along with our beverages. With 12 pieces and was about 14 pounds--it is sushi, so of course it was a little on the pricey side, but it was fresh and pleasant, However, nothing to write home about.My roast duck came with two or three pieces of boy choy and was served over a bed of white rice. The \u00a0duck was crispy and tender, but again, it was nondescript and predictable,as well as my companion's chicken teriyaki and my other friend's tonkatsu ramen.The service was great-I barely felt that the servers were there, yet they managed to answer our every need in an efficient manner. I would have given this place 4 stars, but I felt the food could have used a little more \"oomph,\" which I understand is difficult when you decide to do a pan-Asian restaurant of any sort. It's difficult to stand out from the crowd.3.5 stars.",

I suppose now I will just have to look out for the tortoise.Oh did I mention paying \u00a31 extra for potatoes and finding None at all when I opened up my meal back home? Oh and not to mention, I walked all the way back to the restaurant to complain and they basically called me a liar and refused to give me the \u00a31 extra I had paid for.So if you like being ripped off and eating hair definitely go to hair and tortoise, a well deserved name.",

The staff were extremely attentive and friendly and we were seated quickly, even on a busy Saturday night. Pluses? Portion sizes are huge and the price is affordable. Negatives? Unfortunately the food was pretty mediocre IMO. If you're not snobby about Japanese food then you'll be fine... but I'm pretty fussy about getting it right.Lesson learnt: I should just listen to Yelp. It was, as described, pretty bland.",

    "text": "I grew up in Hawaii and one of my favorites to eat was Japanese Ramen soup. I researched London restaurants looking for a variety of foods to eat. I was quite happy to have found Hare & Tortoise (H&T), which was located just a 5-minute walk from my hotel (George Hotel B&B). The restaurant serves a nice variety of salads and sides, tempuras, sushi, sashimi, a variety of sushi \"lunch boxes\", noodle dishes, rice dishes, and Ramen soups. Six of us had dinner (29 Oct 2011) after a long day of sightseeing in London. We didn't have reservations and we waited 15 minutes. That gave us time to go through their menu, which was filled with lots of photos that whet our appetites. We were all hungry.  The restaurant was full and with good reason. The food was excellent! Tony and I started with the Unagi and avocado maki (eight pieces for \u00a37.70) - grilled eel with avocado, omelet and rolled inside out. For my entr\u00e9e, I had the seafood Ramen soup, which consisted of shrimp, grilled salmon, fish cakes, mussel, and scallops, along with bamboo shoots, seaweed, and scallions. Tony had the Miso Ramen soup (char-sui pork, boiled egg, bean sprouts, seaweed and scallions. Mark ordered the Curry Laksa, which was a spicy curry coconut flavor with chicken, prawns, squid, and rice noodles. It was topped with tofu, bean sprouts, and cucumber. The others ordered some of the same soups. Being a cold evening, the soups warmed us up and were filling. The soups ranged from \u00a35.50 to \u00a37, which is very reasonable.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and only wish there was a place like this where I live. I'll just have to return to London and to the T&H.",

It was my first meal of the day and the ambience was great, the food was delicious and reasonably priced, and the staff was friendly.The restaurant itself was a clean modern theme with some Asian influence. I ended up ordering the beef chili and black bean lo mein with the chicken karage side dish. The karage arrived first, and it was absolutely great. The chicken had a thin crunchy crust that gave way to a juicy and incredibly soft inside. It was incredibly well cooked and the mayo dip provided only added to it. The only qualm I have is that there was an absurd amount of green to chicken ratio. There were maybe 6-7 pieces of chicken and a mountain of salad (I ate it anyways).The beef chili lo mein arrived shortly after and it was amazing. The beef was very well cooked, the ratio between vegetables, noodles, and protein was good, and the onions and peppers were crunchy which added a nice texture to the dish. Solid experience.",

Loss of one star simply because the service can be hit or miss. Arrive during busy lunch periods and expect to be asked for your order before you've even taken your coat off. However, when I've eaten there later in the day staff are less brash and very friendly and welcoming. Overall probably the nicest restaurant to visit within the Brunswick complex.",

My only criticism would be that my salmon teriyaki was lacking in sauce, so I did have to use a lot of soy on my remaining rice once the salmon was gone, but as the portion was so huge I couldn't finish the rice anyway, that isn't much of a chastisement!

Luckily I'm staying nearby, but from what I can tell this is the only place that serves a variety of regional Asian cuisines in the Russell Square area. This is the ONLY place I could find that served Japanese curry within a 10 block radius, so I hastily made my way over there. The restaurant is small with a very airy, light, and modern interior. I came at off-time to avoid the crowd, but there still were a good number of tables filled despite it being late afternoon on a weekday. I went ahead and ordered the pork katsu curry, but noticed they have a good number of south east asian dishes in addition to all of the Japanese entrees. Quite a good variety! My curry came out within 10 minutes of ordering it. Every main dish comes served in a really beautifully decorated porcelain bowl- something I wouldn't expect for a place with such cheap prices! The serving of rice, curry sauce, and meat was quite substantial. The curry itself was incredibly tasty and rich, and it had lots of veggies mixed in. Definitely one of my favorite curry-rice dishes I've ever eaten at a restaurant. The servers were very sweet and attentive. Even though I've only tried one dish, I definitely think they're worth visiting if you're in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "My work colleagues decided we needed to go out for lunch. They chose Hare and Tortoise because they are huge fans. It's quite close to their building (ours it a bit further away). I'm always up for trying any new place so I was keen to give it a try.This branch opens at 12:00, so if you get there right around then, it's quite easy to get a table. When we left around 1:15, the place was packed, so it's definitely popular. I can see why, the food is fairly inexpensive and decent, so you feel like you're getting a good lunch somewhere.I had the brown rice tea (because I love that stuff), and it was quite nice. Plus it's unlimited refills, so I made sure to have a second cup. I also went for the Penang Prawn Mee. It was one of the few items on the menu with three chillies. And with the rain, it seemed like a big bowl of soup might be nice.It also came out very quickly (so obviously they do have a lot of stuff made up in advance). Everything was nice. Pork cooked well and was soft. Prawns also cooked well. The soup had nice flavor, but it was far from three chillies. I'd say a half a chilli if anything. Barely any spice. So that was a bit disappointing, but since it's about half the price of expensive ramen joints where the food isn't really much better, I at least feel like I'm getting value for money instead of spending a ridiculous amount of money on what amounts to a bland bowl of soup.So yeah, it's probably a place to come back to for a work lunch. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here with friends or on my own, but someone suggested it, I would definitely come along.",
