    "text": "i've been to several of the breakfast clubs around london, and have had mixed experiences in terms of food and service. i was nevertheless excited to try out the \"secret\" bar in the new clapham common/battersea breakfast club with a couple of visiting friends. i'll review the \"secret\" bar separately, as we ended up having one drink there & then heading through to the restaurant to eat some dinner. being a quiet monday night, the service & atmosphere was great - chilled out, and no screaming children like the review below found (the corridor which leads to the bathrooms seems to back up the fact that it has turned into a yummy mummy meeting point as it was lined up with baby chairs...not for me, thank you)we ordered some buffalo chicken wings to share. i'm a big buffalo wings fan, but i do often find that restaurants do it badly - not so here - they were delicious! it was a good size portion, but I would say for \u00a37 it ought to be. for my main, i ordered the veggie burger. it was a monster! i always just do away with the bun in cases like this so that i can try to eat as much of the \"proper\" food as possible - that being said, i was still defeated and left all the colesaw and about half of my fries as there was just so much food on my plate. so much delicious food though - let me tell you - it was difficult for me to stop eating those delicious skin on chips!we also ordered some cocktails as they have a happy hour to 8pm (\u00a35 cocktails!). i really recommend the morning mojito which has grapefruit juice in - so delicious.i'll be back here for sure, but only in the evenings when there is less chance of a brood of children disturbing my joy.",

    "text": "This Soho brunch institution finally opened a branch south of the river in my hood in May and I only got round to trying it the other week! First impression on walking in were good, loved the retro decor, styled like a 50s kitchen and an 80s laundrette. The staff were friendly, young and hip adding to the general vibe of the place. I was hungover and in dire need of coffee and a hearty brunch to put me to rights. The Breakfast Club did not fail me. They had a really good choice on the brunch menu (as you'd expect) and it was quite difficult to choose but we went for the All American and the Huevos Al Benny in the end. The pancakes in the All American were soft and fluffy and so more-ish. The home-style potatoes with this I'd say are a bit of a carb-overload with everything else included - think we'd happily just have pancakes with bacon next time. Huevos Al Benny - we were drawn to this because of the chorizo, fresh chilli, and avocado with the usual poached eggs, muffins and hollandaise. The fresh chilli added the perfect kick to the smokey paprika chorizo and creamy avocado. A definite must-try for the more adventurous brunchers. We went on a Friday lunchtime and it wasn't too overly busy, but I can imagine it getting packed out and having to queue as in Soho on a weekend seeing as its in prime position on the Battersea Rise strip.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner last night with a friend, and we were very happy with our meal overall! The one big disappointment was that we expected them to be serving breakfast all day, naturally. Having spent the better part of 10 minutes deliberating over the breakfast part of the menu and finally making up our minds, we then noted the part at the top that says the breakfast bit is only served until 5pm on weekdays. So we then had to start over on the dinner bit. We split a nachos with chili to start, which was outrageously wonderful. We also split an Elvis milkshake - banana, peanut butter and vanilla ice cream. It was fantastic. My friend had an incredible looking sandwich that easily could have fed two people, and I had the 'Cow vs Pig' burger. It was essentially a burger topped with pulled pork. My only regret on receiving it was that they never asked how I wanted it cooked, and I thus forgot to ask for it rare, and it was way too well done. Also the chips that came with it I wasn't a fan of. The coleslaw that came with it was delicious, though! They also needed to keep a pitcher of tap water on the table, as the glasses they gave us for water were minuscule and we had to continually keep asking for refills. The service was super friendly, though, and all around we had a great time and left stuffed. Will be back!",

It was well cooked and well and truly filled me up for my journey home so top marks breakfast club",

I had the Veggie Pancakes with eggs, veggie sausage, home fries, pancakes and maple syrup. Yum! I am slightly obsessed with the savoury food and maple combo.

However, we planned to come on an off time and had no wait. Whoot whoot.I had the half monty which is was plenty of food and quite filling. I was shocked to see that \"bacon\" meant a ham like item which was ok. I tried my friend's pancakes and they were fluffy and light. He had the full monty and raved about it.The atmosphere is pretty fun and we sat next to fun washer/dryer units. The service is also decent.This is totally worth trying and I understand there are many of these locations throughout London. Just be careful... around busy times, the line goes out the door and around the side of the building. This is a testament to how good this place is.",

So have been waiting for a perfect time to go back and enjoy the legendary huevos al benny, which trust me; is a mouthwatering taste sensation! So after patiently waiting weeks for the crowds to clear we walked past one day surprised to see no queue.Seated in the outside area with great people watching views we were set and excited for my huevos. Unfortunately/annoyingly little did I know the menu changes at 5pm. Even though it was 4:45 they said the menu had changed and the waiter was unwilling or showed no sympathy towards my plea for the huevos al benny . So we had a moment to regroup and think what we were going to eat instead... 15 minutes passed!! and it seemed the waiter had clocked off and was tucking into his dinner on a table nearby! Another waitress came to serve us who was far friendly and even brought us some free water. We ordered with her instead slightly miffed about the wait, but we did have great people watching potential so it kinda went quick.In the end I had the burrito, which tasted amazing and was quickly demolished! I thought the side was a bit of a let down. It was a tiny bit of lettuce covered in an all be it great tasting sauce. MORE please, I'm a hungry boy so needed something just a little bit more substantial.I would come here again before 4:45 if there were not so big a queue just to get stuck into my huevos al benny. The hand dryer in the bathroom COULD be better than a dyson handryer! \u00a0Big call I know but it is pretty special! Let me know your thoughts.",

The little slice of east London meets williamsbourgh planted in the middle of Clapham is always a good place to go with friends and family. Very child friendly and lots of space. The staff is wonderful as always so definitely a joy to visit, whenever you get up early and beat the 30 people queues of colourful hipsters outside! No offence - I'm a sympathiser.",

Enjoyed the eggs Benedict (although the muffin was a little tough to cut through...) and treated myself to a hot brownie with ice cream for dessert that was just melt-on-your-tongue delectable!",

Same menu and large selection although we came in time for lunch there is still all day brunch available. I went with the burrito that comes with your choice from three fillings, which I got the fried chicken. It came as a gigantic serve with salsa, beans and peppers. My companion got the waffles topped with chorizo, veggies and chimichuri. We both shared some chips which were just ok.Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes, having the same great taste as their other location. Condiments on the table or can get anything else you need. In addition I ordered a salted caramel shake which was perfect, thick and yummy! It was topped with caramel popcorn although I was relieved it was not too crazy like the freak shake style.Ambiance was about the same, bright and colourful but not too gawdy. Music was fun. Service was a bit slow as we waited awhile for our food and then after they cleared the table did not ask us or bring the bill until we requested it. Normally they would need the table faster. I will definitely be back!",

I'd advise you to turn up earlier than this if you want to walk in for a table and have a wait of less than 10 minutes.I tried the pancakes with bacon and found it to be alright but not amazing. This was due to most of the syrup ending up over the bacon rather than my pancakes making the bacon far too sweet for my liking and the pancakes dry without the syrup. The potatoes however were a saving grace of the meal and I polished the side dish I ordered of them off quick smart and wished I had just ordered a few more round of those instead. My tea arrives in a mug meaning serious business and no faffing about with mini cups, teapots and milk jugs which I appreciated.The interior has a lovely diner feel to it and it a pleasant location to spend time with friends over breakfast/brunch catching up.

My expectations were met and exceeded. I had the vanilla latte which was sweet but not to much and it was a nice caffeine burst. I had the Huevos Al Benny which is like a Huevos Rancheros vs. Eggs Benedict. Chorizo, eggs, and peppers atop of an english muffin. I also had a side of Spinach which was delicious. Early grey tea to bring my morning buzz back. Pros:The food was great. The waitstaff were attentive and super niceAmbiance - first day of opening... stil working on it a touchThe price was on the higher side, but then again, the quality of breakfast food is also elevated. Balances out. cons:I know this sounds weird, but i got confused as to where to enter. I think I'm in love.______________________________________________UPDATE! One week later to the day of the opening. I spoke too soon, I'm out of love. At this point we're not even speaking anymore. \\Here's the deal breaker. Bad service and babies. Lots and lots of babies in the AM. I can't handle screaming children who aren't disciplined enough or naturally quiet enough to handle being out in public. Dont get me wrong, I actually like kids, I just don't like screaming ones in multiples of 3 that outnumber adults. That I don't like. its turning into a place for yummy mummies and daddies to congregate and commiserate.Now to the service. I was one of 2 people in the place and my tea, its just hot water really... made the 8 feet in about 10 min. seriously. i'm the only paying customer there. \u00a0There was a complaint from a near by customer with the same grievance. Maybe someone was hungover... that I understand.. but I still don't care, mama wants her TEA. Speaking of tea, it was burnt and nothing special. Oh where did we go so wrong?",

    "text": "We had a mixed experience. We ate here yesterday and had a pretty good breakfast of the Veggie Reggie, Artichoke and Sun Blush Tomato Hash, and Butternut Bubble and Asparagus, but were disappointed with service and food today. Although it was much quicker service, the food and end service was a let down. We had Pancakes & Berries, the Veggie All American and Home-Made Granola. The \"vanilla cream\" for the pancakes was a grossly huge pile of separated sweet-cream butter with some powdered sugar and syrup. It was so gross to put that pile of butter on top and call it a vanilla cream. My daughter got sick after breakfast and I suspect it was from trying to eat that gross \"vanilla cream\" on the pancakes. The pancakes were very heavy but had a nice taste on their own, but that could have been from the dusting of powered sugar on top of the dish, which added a nice sweetness. The veggie American was not very good. I made the mistake of not tasting the syrup before pouring it on my cakes. The maple syrup tasted like it was some kind of sorghum syrup that has a bitter finish which was also an unpleasant surprise. I think this was masked by the powdered sugar on the Pancakes & Berries dish. My bottom cake was soaked with moisture from the watery onions put on top of the potatoes and undercooked scrambled eggs. As for the eggs, after eating what I thought was an over-seasoned top layer of scrambled eggs, I realized from the absence of any pepper that the eggs just had seasoning on the top so it was bland eating anything under the top layer. My daughter had said the eggs were over seasoned yesterday and it only dawned on me that she experienced the same thing. At least that was consistent. I only ate the top layer of eggs since I didn't want to risk sickness from eating undercooked eggs. The potatoes that I liked so much yesterday had a lot of wet onions laid on top of them which made them soggy (and the pancake below taste like onions). The mushrooms which were so flavorful from roasting were steamed/boiled today and a rubbery texture and unpleasant flavor.The granola was merely okay but the spiced plum compote on the menu was replaced by very tart berries. This doesn't mix well with the already tart yogurt. Finally, it was bewilderingly long to get our change, which we finally gave up on to catch our car. We watched the person walk to the kitchen then back around to the basement then to the register carrying our bill. I walked over to her to get my change since the rest of my family left to get the car but instead she stopped with cashing our check to deal with somone's wayward child and have the waitress give them their check instead of finishing with ours. I was so irritated that I told her I wasn't waiting any longer for our change as we had a car waiting and thanks for nothing. On it's face, it doesn't seem to be hard to give change from 30.00 for a 29.19 bill. \u00a0Surprisingly here, it took a trip to the kitchen, basement, and register and it still couldn't be accomplished at the register. I'm glad we had a good meal yesterday but will not try them again.",

You can eggs anyway you like them, pancakes with everything, smoothies, milkshakes, coffees and the best freshly squeezed orange juice. These guys are good at what they do and do it well. Only negative was that the service was a bit slow as it was so busy!",

The mixture of savoury and spice, from the sausage and potatoes, coupled with pancake and syrup, with the addition of the creamy scrabble was divine. Also, the service was quick and polite , the American diner theme definitely added to the experience. I look forward to going there again!",

    "text": "I had such a great time playing bingo at BC last night! Anne Hiking is such a lovely, sweet, funny, welcoming host - we wanted to put her in our pockets and take her home she was so cute!! It's a fun night (probably made more so by happy hour wine and cocktails, and me winning the first game to the tune of a pancake breakfast for two!).The decor in the cafe is good, kitsch fun and the size of the bingo game is kept to a good amount that gives everyone more of a chance to win. By a fluke it was all girls last night so the game took on a definite girl power air, with one of the poor waiters being singled out for special attention from Anne (he took it well!)I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and skin on chips - so yummy and only a tenner! And then after the games had finished and we'd had our food and drinks, we took our receipt 'next door' (through an internal door that lead through a 'laundromat' to a cute, cheap little bar) and got half price cocktails there! Such a fun night and we will be doing it as often as possible. Long live bingo, long live evenings at the Breakfast Club(but not so much the huge queues for breakfasts on a weekend).",

    "text": "For my first visit to The Breakfast Club I made the incredibly poor decision of going on a rainy Saturday, after having spent the evening (and early hours of the morning) prior at Fabric - but that's another review entirely.So while I was aware of the ABSOLUTE FACT that I would have to wait in a line, I really should have forced my hungover brain to give a little more consideration to the wait. Alas I did not, but it's ok, I did survive to tell this tale.The staff were very attentive offering (The Breakfast Club-branded) umbrellas and free hot chocolates to those of us queued outside. And the hot chocolate was so good I opted for a full-size version as soon as I got to the table - with marshmallows, naturally.The wait was about 20 minutes, so nothing unbearable, but we did manage to cut it a little shorter by teaming up with another table of two and sharing a table for four instead.The decision on what to eat was pretty simple - it was the All American Breakfast all-round, with a side of French Toast to share. The French Toast was slightly unnecessary in terms of portion sizes, but did I mention my hangover?I loved everything on the plate, and while I had mentally prepared myself not to expect the food to come out too quickly there was no need. The table and food service were super efficient.",
