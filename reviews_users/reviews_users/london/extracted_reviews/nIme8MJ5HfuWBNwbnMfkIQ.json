We were seated promptly but were forgotten about for a little while until we finally managed to get the waiters attention. My mum mentioned the lack of service and it was good from then on. We ordered a pizza from the specials menu and it was delicious and just how I remembered it. The pizza is in the traditional Italian thin base style and the menu has some interesting topping combo's without breaking the bank. One thing that this Pizza place really has going for it though, is the views of the Thames. We were there at sunset and it was absolutley beautiful. My tip for a date is to plan ahead and book a table by the window for sunset, lovely.",

Canned pineapple, lettuce and those crappy tiny frozen prawns you get in prawn cocktail does not a 'Gourmet Salad' make! Also olive oil does not constitute a salad dressing in my book, it's just oil.",

I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this restaurant as the management have a total disregard for, and have no idea of how to treat or speak to their customers or have any respect for them.GO TO THE GOURMET PIZZA COMPANY AT YOUR PERIL!!!",

I love this restaurant mainly due to its fantastic location on the South Bank and if you're lucky enough to get a window seat on the river then you couldn't ask for a better spot to enjoy food in London. There's a really pleasant village atmosphere to the area with a few boutique type shops and other restaurants and cafes. The menu is mainly pizza but they do offer other great Italian food but why bother when the pizzas are so amazing?! The staff aren't always the friendliest but this is understandable as I've never seen this place any less than full so they're busy working hard all day long. It's very romantic when coupled with a walk down the river after your meal in the evening through, what's recognised by many, as the cultural focal point of London. I most definitely recommend Gourmet Pizza!",

Our intention was to head into central London for food after the recording however we soon changed our mind as the aroma from the GPC hit us. So having been suitably entertained we arrived and queued for seats. As there were larger parties in front of us we were seated quickly in the 'Al fresco' area however as it was a summer eveing we had no complaints about our view over the Thames in to London. Our orders were quickly taken and dispatched to us and having had 2 courses and a drink we were out in 45 mins. The food was delicious and the best part was the cost \u00a326!! Try getting that in central London.",

Had the Chicago pizza. Nothing like a real Chicago pizza so i'm not sure where they got the name for that pizza. The meat on it wasn't very nice as it tasted like \u00a0sloppy joe meat. But outside of the sweetened ground beef, it was nice.However, very difficult to cut into the thing when they only give you a butter knife. It was a big challenge for me and my date.

I loves its old style fishing village feel, ramshackled huts and a miniature beach at the front where you can take in the acrid Thames river breeze... Well nowhere's perfect!Quick lunch here to treat ourselves with a work friend. We went because she has a Taste card and could get half price. We got there and were told they no longer accept Taste cards. Well please update your information then! We stayed anyway, how can you not when you're under time pressure to eat lunch.Nice inside though, we grabbed a table in a conservatory-like annexe for optimum people watching (my favourite restaurant pasttime/ favourite pasttime in most situations!). A cheeky glass of wine each as a treat, we considered splitting a bottle but decided to be good and not drink overly during work hours. Frankly, I think a small round of applause for us is due if you're reading this!Healthy option to compensate for wine, we had salads. I had tuna nicoise, really fresh and good helping of all the ingredients. Too much parmesan though, the whole thing was a bit salty - it had anchovies as well and that is too much salt indeed! Nice portion though, I was full by the end. My friend has chicken and avocado, also looked good. Service was fine, nothing special but we got served quickly enough. The killer for me was price. For that quality salad and a glass of wine I would hope about \u00a313-15. \u00a317 is a touch much (casual rhyme for you there reader) for my liking. Good spot though, LOVE THE LOCATION",

We chose this place for it's convenient location, nearby the hotel my Dad was staying at. I did think it may be interesting with choices like Beetroot and Duck. The menu looked fine, and the prices were ok. The starters were relatively uninspiring - my mussels in (not) spicy tomato sauce were small and not very tasty. The rest were ok. Then onto the pizza - well I have to say i was shocked - although the toppings were fine, there were stains on the cheese and base - suggesting the sauce and toppings had been in place for sometime - not fresh?!!!! It's pizza - how can you not make it fresh??? The bases on all pizza's were not crispy enough, maybe at the edge, but mainly doughy and extremely hard to cut. Not a good at all. The puddings were ok. The only reason I've given this place a 3 star is for the service - our waitress was great. Pizza should be a \u00a0relatively easy thing to produce, good pizza is well worth having. I was severely disappointed Gourment Pizza managed to do such a poor job, especially since my Dad had just run over 26 miles to get there. Meh!!",

    "text": "This little pizza hut (excuse the pun) has been on Gabriel's Wharf for as long as I can remember. \u00a0I always gravitate towards it, take a little walk around the artisan shops around the square, remember that they are all a bit disappointing, then love the quaintness of a permanent pizza fixture in a temporary structure - it literally is a wooden hut, and today we were sat in a tent on the outside of the wooded hut ... still, you can't beat the views and the excitement of finding an independent eatery in an area that is becoming increasingly corporate.What a shame that Gourmet Pizza don't take more pride in their food and try to live up to their name. \u00a0Every time I go I forget why I was disappointed the last time. \u00a0Time to write a little review to remind myself - this is fast food rather than gourmet with maximum numbers of people crammed into a small space, orders taken and delivered in record time (probably a good thing if you are fitting in a pre-theatre meal, I give you that ...); the pizza base is tasty but nothing special and not even crusty, the toppings not fresh: the peppers and caramelised onions on my veggie pizza today were definitely from a tin, presumably so were the bits of aubergine and courgette (cut up too small to get a proper taste). \u00a0The overall result was OK, but only just.The location is great and they probably have great passing trade, what a shame they don't care enough to make this a more enjoyable experience to make people return more frequently.",

    "text": "Fantastic location right by the river, especially when it's warm and you can sit outside and pretend you're on holiday. As mentioned by others, it is cramped so probably best avoided if you prefer quiet, spacious dining. Get the chorizo and pumpkin ravioli. I had it as a starter but it also comes as a main. Glistening with butter, it was the standout dish for me. I found my large salad supremely healthy if a little lacking in execution. Not enough avocado and too much raw rocket made it particularly peppery. Honeycomb cheesecake sounded better than it was. (I feel like I'm often disappointed by restaurant cheesecakes.)Still, service was speedy and amicable. Plus, with a taste card, the meal was unbelievably good value - \u00a313.50 for three courses.",

It is located right on the Thames River and a great spot to catch a sunset.We were all exhausted but looking for a tasty meal to end our day with. \u00a0Since we arrived late in the night when they were going to close, we ended up sitting inside. The restaurant is not by any means large, so everyone is pretty close together, in fact when the woman next to me was putting her coat on, I got whacked in the head.....We ordered a pizza, lasagna and garlic bread. We were all looking forward to our meal. It did take a while to receive and most of the staff seemed to all be little confused about who was covering the various tables. When dinner finally arrived, the pizza was thin crust and just ok. The lasagna was a huge disappointment. It was served in a skillet pan and it was just basically noodles, sauce and cheese. It almost looked like a crepe with sauce on top. I have never tasted lasagna like this and I was not too thrilled. Maybe I missed the boat and ordered the wrong item???Does this place live up to its name Gourmet Pizza?? Not really. Would I return again, probably not. I would think in a location like this, the service would have been top notch as this is a very busy section of the city.",

However, the prime location comes at a cost, mostly in the form of very little wiggle room. The tables are incredibly close together and both my friend and myself struggled to find space for our rucksacks, there was also the annoyance of the two tables around ours being so close that we constantly bumped into other people's chairs or were pushed by people standing up or sitting down. Trying to get to the loo without plowing through people was an adventure!We both had a pasta dish, so I can't comment on the actual pizza, but the pesto pasta was okay! Good flavour and a nice large helping of extra cheese were plus points, a big puddle of oil being left in the bottom of the plate was a big minus point. Our server was quite rushed, effective but not courteous or friendly. It seemed very much like they just want to get you in and out as fast as possible.",

We ordered the dough balls, a tuna pasta, and a margherita pizza for us (3 people) to share. Unlike the name suggests, the pizza was mediocre. It was something you could expect at a fast food pizza place. The dough balls were amazing. The garlic butter isn't too overwhelming, and it didn't have pieces of garlic in it. They tasted good with or without the garlic butter. The tuna pasta was pretty good, but it was spicy, so I decided to order a lasagna, which I noticed earlier. That was the best decision. When the lasagna arrived, I knew it would be good. It was sizzling, and the layer of cheese on top was melted and yummy. It tasted so good, that's all I can say. Perfect. Come here, definitely, but don't order the pizza, get a pasta instead.",

The location is very nice and the staff is friendly, quick and competent.Two of us had pizzas, one had a salad and one had an Italian entree. \u00a0Everyone was happy and our bank of British pounds remained relatively unbroken. \u00a0Gourmet Pizza is a winner, and a good choice for families with kids and teens.

Such a lovely location on the river in Gabriel's Wharf and the staff are lovely.There's a great range of pizzas and they're all freshly made to order, which I love. I ordered the cajun chicken, bacon and goats cheese pizza but asked for it without the peppers. There were four of us and I think we all removed our substituted something on our pizzas but it wasn't a problem for them at all. The pizzas were all really good with plenty of toppings and they were very tasty. The only thing was that we all struggled to cut through the bases. They were thin and crispy and obviously hand made (just how I like them) but these were perhaps a little too crispy. Even if they gave us pizza cutters or sharper knives we wouldn't have minded so much as they didn't taste bad and they weren't burnt.It is a little on the pricey side for what you get but we had a voucher which made it really good value.I'll definitely visit again, especially in the summer with the wonderful location and view, and I'd recommend giving it a try to anyone thinking of going to a nearby Pizza Express!",

We were sat at a long table and as we were provided with menus while waiting, we all knew what to order. It looks like everybody at the table ordered something different and they all looked good. I went for a slightly different pizza to normal, bacon (normal) with beets (not normal) and blue cheese (even more not normal). The combination however totally works. Bit of banter with the staff and we all had a good time for surprisingly good money seeing as we were on the South Bank. Sceptical going in and very happy to be proven wrong.",

    "text": "I'm finding it increasingly hard to get excited about pizza restaurants these days and this experience was no exception.The menu was very limited, most options are vegetarian with only two 'meaty' options (one being prosciutto and rocket), not so good if you like your home comforts.I quite like trying new things when out and it's hard to get enthusiastic as there just seemed to be a lack a variety here. There were a lot of options you don't normally find on run of the mill pizza restaurants, however these all seemed very traditional and nothing stood out as being novel.Opting for the Hot & Spicy Macho, I found this to be an average pizza with a thick topping of meat and cheese, the base being a little soggy for my liking as I've always been more excited about the crispy bases.The chicken and goats cheese salad we shared was impressive in size. You get a lot of bang for your buck with a lot of salad and selection of leaves, chicken and cheese, but whilst I was impressed with this, it was drenched in salad dressing, so unless you specify at the time of ordering, don't expect a healthy alternative here!The most outstanding part of this experience was the location, based right on the river this is indeed a romantic spot, I could assume when it's raining that it would be lovely to spend a romantic afternoon here over shared pizza and drinks.The prices aren't cheap, however you are paying for location, however you need to get to the front of the restaurant for the views.The staff were a little icy, but it was quite late be honest.I couldn't but help leaving a little devoid of enthusiasm for this place, I was expecting something a little more exceptional from a restaurant named 'Gourmet'.",

It is a little crowded in there and we were quite squished in to our table for 2, definitely not the place if you want a discreet intimate dinner, considering the proximity to other tables. We shared some garlic dough balls to start, they were good, nothing really amazing, the pizza I had though was delicious, I loved the more interesting options available especially as a veggie I had the Vedure di Capra, the base was crispy and the toppings were plenty exactly how I like it. We shared a bottle of the house red and sadly we didn't have time for dessert. We came on a tastecard so it was super cheap for us, but overall the prices are really good considering the location.
