I love the School related d\u00e9corthe attention to detail that has gone into it is great. The sofas are nice too and the staff were very friendly. I had a bottled beer, mostly because it was easy to order in the absence of a drinks list, but happy hour prices still tend to work out more expensive when you are getting bottles instead of pints (nothing on tap or draught here and a bottle of ale will set you back 4 pounds. I was actually a little bit disappointed by my visit here in the end. This place has stormed into my qype recommendations through all the positive reviews and really I guess I expected too much from a cocktail bar, the kind of bar which I rarely like. We were also the only people there in the early evening, but I'm sure it gets busier later. I have to give it 3 for its unique look and feel. I would recommend coming here with a group of old school friends!",

The Old School Yard also has a basement pub which kind of reminded me of the basement party room in the house I grew up in. And to top it off there was a fantastic bartender who mixed some great cocktails. I told him that I wanted something fresh with cucumber and after a few minutes of mixing and shaking I was presented with a unique cocktail made with cucumber, bell pepper, thyme, some ginger to give it a kick, and probably a few other secret ingredients. It was a great drink to have on a wam summer night. There is also a small outside area which is great if you smoke and we were also treated to a barbecue.I had a great time and will be back - the Old School Yard is such a chilled and friendly place with great staff you can't help but to feel at home.",

The basement of the Old School Yard is what I imagine the inside of a Pirate Ship (think Captain Hook's ship) to look like; with its vintage look piano, giant barrels and cocktail cabinets. And if you weren't already enchanted, the fabulous bartender will certainly put a smile on your face. I don't drink alcohol, but he was determined to please and made up an interesting variety of cocktails for me and my husband to try. With drinks in hand, we settled down on the comfy couches in the cosy den area for some retro gaming. Equipped with a large flat screen television and Xbox, you'll find yourself all set for an entertaining evening. A great venue and fantastic event. I'm sure I'll find an excuse to go back!",

    "text": "As soon as I walked in, I knew it was my kind of pub. Huge screens, games to be played, drinks to be consumed, and a feeling of space. The main problem was a distinct lack of chairs - but if you're playing, why are you sitting down? There's even a tiny back garden with some faux grass if you need a sense of fresh air - or you can stand outside the pub itself, which has plenty of space. There's even a wonderfully decorated basement with all sorts of nick nacks and decoration touches. On the night we were there to look at Windows Mobile phones and gaming, there was even a very knowledgable cocktail meister serving some delicious cocktails (we counted watermelon and ginger amongst the ingredients) and some oh-so-juicy burgers. Nom om om. Alas, I didn't get to spend as much time as I would have liked with the phone or with the gaming, but it seemed to have a whizzy user interface that had come on leaps and bounds since my last-thwarted attempt to get a Windows phone to work with me, back in 2008. The games looked fun, the screen looked bright and colourful, and the interface seemd incredibly responsive to my touches. Aside, that is, from the touch-screen keyboard which was responsive but just couldn't quite cope with my drunken attempts at writing a text - but then again, I've never gotten on with touch-screen keyboards generally. If only there was a way to actually try a phone in the real world for a while before you bought one - I'm in the market for a new phone, but have yet to find a cool phone with a physical keyboard - and touch-screen keyboards and I just don't seem to get on yet. And yes, I've been told that I need to train touchscreen keyboards to respond to me - but quite frankly, if I have to train an input device, then something's gone wrong straight away. I already know how to read and write - I don't need to adjust my reading skills for a different book, do I?",

Well, yes, very probably - but take my word for it, you cannot fail to be bowled over by this brilliant little drinking den. Then again, perhaps I'm biased because it felt as though I'd stepped right into the set of a 1980s brat pack flick. Or because they have their very own Nintendo 64 console where you can play Mario Kart whilst glugging indecently tasty (and indecently cheap) cocktails. Or perhaps it's just because when I was there, they were playing 'Romancing the Stone' on the big screen in the main area of the bar. On repeat. Or maybe it's because their bar staff are some of the friendliest in London and really go that extra mile to serve you delicious cocktails catered to your own unique tastes. Whatever it is, you can't help leaving this place wishing that there were more pubs like it - not just in London, but the whole world over. I'll certainly be paying it a visit again and again and again the next time I'm in London - if you're reading this lads, mine's a Martini!",

    "text": "Update Yay! Karaoke! I can't add extra stars, but I super like the new downstairs bar. The karaoke videos are delightfully tacky, but that's what makes them awesome (although I'm still a bit scarred by the Bohemian Rhapsody one, which had the power to stop everyone singing and just watch). Staff are as friendly as ever, I like it muchly and might not have parties anywhere else ever. Update This is a wonderful, strange little bar. It's set to become my new favourite secret place. So I'm not really sure why I'm telling everyone about it here. It was recommended to me as I was looking for somewhere in London Bridge to get a margarita. It's such a pub-rich area, but there aren't many decent bars. So I found my way here. I'm not sure why I walked the back way from London Bridge, but it's a strange walk through a suburban area. Which makes you wonder if you're going the right way at all, and if you are, why would someone put a cocktail bar here? But they did, and it's wonderful. A bit of a dive, yes. But somehow that works. It looks like a school common room, but only if your school was like the one in Saved By The Bell. There's Ninja Turtles video games, and they have Guitar Hero tournaments too. The cocktails are a bit hit and miss - my marg was average, the apple martini too sweet. BUT, and this is the saving grace for me, the Pisco Sour was AMAZING. They get extra points for my epic hangover the next day. But it's shortcomings are soon forgotten when everyone is dancing and watching the barmen bodypopping and flaring. We left and came back, but the staff remembered us. The atmosphere was friendly, despite the bar feeling like a local. I really really like it here. I also like that happy hour makes the cocktails \u00a34.50 a go, but even after happy hour has finished they're only \u00a36 or so. Brilliant. This isn't a swanky place. But it's fun, it's silly and I wanted to stay here and dance to Queen and Savage Garden all night. Decent Pisco Sour AND Savage Garden? They get five stars for that even though the toilets were a bit of a mess. Some things about school shouldn't be replicated.",

Boasting everything from table football to retro arcade games there is plenty of themed entertainment, while graffiti lockers and 80s posters take you back to your school days. The beer garden is large enough for a good 20-30 people and it stays sunny until late into the evening \u00a0and with room for a barbeque you can't ask for more. The downstairs bar is more impressive still, awash with vintage artefacts and more of that retro feel. The games room a great addition and I must have whiled away at least an hour relaxing on one of the generous sofas, sipping a mojito and re-acquainting myself with Streets of Rage 2. Certainly something not your average bar! The drinks deserve a special mention. With an enormous variety of spirits and fresh ingredients in the downstairs bar you can be sure of some truly excellent cocktails. Of particular note are the Jamaican Mule and the Amaretto Sour, but if you're after a simple pint then you won't have any problems finding something to your liking. This isn't one of the pretentious 'bottle-only' bars and everything is on offer at reasonable prices. With a warm atmosphere, an excellent range of drinks and a cool 80s feel, a fun night is guaranteed at the Old School Yard.",

This school-themed bar boasting graffited lockers and situated next to a primary school is everything that you wish your sixth form common room was, but secretly know that you would have failed your A-levels if it actually was. There's a cool crowd, squidgy sofas and a couple of games consoles packed with retro video games \u00a0think Streets of Rage and Donkey Kong. I was here for a Qype and Window's Mobile event and because of the gorgeous June weather we decided to make the most of the outdoor courtyard area and enjoy a barbecue cooked up by our affable host Darren. The burgers and sausages that we were served may have been deliciously succulent, but a special mention needs to go out to Mickael Perron, the Heston Blumenthal of bartenders. After talking me in to trying a refreshing thyme and red pepper cocktail, his drinks proceeded to get even better throughout the night. The icing on the cake was an amaretto sour containing citrus fruits, which managed to be both deliciously fruity whilst still keeping that delicious marzipan flavour. The spray-painted Che Guevera on top of the cocktail was the piece de la resistance and I couldn't stop gushing it for days afterward. Mickael even runs cocktail classes at the Old School Yard and this is something that I definitely need to look into.",

The front bar is large, with enough rom between bar (and what a bar!) and back wall to allow for both raccous fun and people to get through without spilling their drinks. The back garden is small, but very well laid out spaces ensure a lot of people can fit in there without anyone feeling claustrophobic. The real treat is the basement, which reminded me of my grandparents' cellar - that weird combo of everything in the house which has been relegated to domestic limbo was down there, from old couches to liquor cabinets - and of course, a very new tv and XBox 360 to play old and new games alike. I don't drink, but I can say when people got their drinks (the mixologist was a bit of a perfectionist) they found them a lovely blend. We were also there for an event, the pre-launch of the new Windows 7 phone. I got to handle the phone a few times, through a Snake Tournament (I took 4th! woot!) and through ones being passed around. The phone has an easy interface, and I found taking photos to be very easy (but the video automatically slaps on a VERY bright light which took a bit to get rid of). Overall, a great night with great hosts and a great location. :)",

The basement area is a mix of curiosty shop and the best stocked bar. Dotted around the area are various items of antiquity that gives the place an ambience and talking points. At the back is a small prepartaion area where Mickael was producing some amazing cocktails (I recommend buying Croft Pink Port great in or out of a cocktail). After the event finished I stayed around and had a great chat with the owner Darren about the venue and the cocktails. Heading upstairs the main bar had a feeling of my old 6th form common room. A relaxed atmosphere with bean bags, table football and retro arcade games. Along with a various posters/paraphanalia about to remind you of school eg lockers, a giant clock set to 3.30 home time. I will definately go back here, either with a group of friends to try the cocktail area again or just a small crowd to try the upstairs bar which looks like it will be good fun, people were even dancing on the tables and bar at the end of the night.

The bar was quiet for our early happy hour arrival, which was great for catching up and analysing their extensive but very affordable cocktail list. I was really happy with the long bench table they'd placed me at, at the front right of the room between some of the games they offer. A pizza was ordered (which was pretty tasty), drinks were had (I don't think I disliked a single cocktail, and I drank many) and conversations flowed until later on when the bar began to fill up. The only downside is my beer drinking buddies couldn't get anything on tap as there was none. I don't drink beer though, so I don't care. Maybe it was the alcohol, or the joy of getting to play Mario Kart 64 for free while my SO was demolished by a stranger in foosball (also free), but getting to spend my birthday here was awesome. The place is fun, not too fancy and the other patrons were incredibly friendly. Definitely recommend and I'll definitely be going back.",

Despite this, The Old School Yard is a decent place The downside is that the drinks are from bottles or cans so no draught pumps so not advisable for real ale or beer drinkers. Good for cocktail drinkers though.There was a surprise with a downstairs area I never knew about, which has free Karaoke booths and a nice seating area, also Table Football and retro video games so all in all, not bad.",

They also have a Nintendo 64 and a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles arcade game (which I was terrible at). But, it isn't really just about the games...it's about the amazingly designed cocktail menu that looks like a comic book, it's about the delicious pizzas named after the different Turtles that are ordered in for you, it's about the throwback music, and it's about the hidden karaoke booths downstairs. Such a great vibe at this place!!The only thing that let me down was one of the bar staff, who was kind of an ass, and clearly didn't have any customer service skills. There was however a great barman who made up for his colleague's incompetence. So it didn't put me off wanting to come again!",

They have a generous happy hour (until 9pm, I think) but even if you miss it the drinks are super reasonable. This seems to be especially popular with the mid-20s and up crowd, and especially young professionals, which is unsurprising given the retro feel of the entire place (replete with classic arcade games, N64 with Mario Kart permanently on rotation). There's also a foosball table, and karaoke and Wii in the less-ventured-to downstairs area. The music appeals to everyone it seems, ranging from Journey to JT, Blackstreet and Biggy (and everything in between). Basically, if you're near London Bridge and looking for an unpretentious, fun place, definitely hit up the Old School Yard.",

All of the previous reviews about killer music selection are spot-on. I am awful at keeping up with pop music these days (Ariana who?) so anytime a song produced pre-2010 comes on the radio, I actually stand a chance at knowing it. The Old School Yard feels like it was basically made for me and all the other old souls who listen to music on a minimum-5-year lag. I mean, come on. You know a bar is going to be good when \"I Want You Back\" is playing when you walk in.It's pretty crowded on the ground floor because the bar takes up most of the room, leaving not that much space to stand/dance. There are also some spots that are directly illuminated by hot spotlights, making you feel kind of exposed.. feels like the whole bar is counting the pores on my face, haha. I didn't get a chance to explore the basement this time, but will check it out the next time I go (which is hopefully soon!)",

They have a wide range of cocktails that are all very respectable in quality and far less that most other London cocktails. Not too mention their happy hour which offers even better deals.The food menu offers average american bar food options as well as teenage mutant ninja turtle themed pizzas. Which leads us to the real reason this place is such a gem.Where else can you play the original arcade version of TMNT, foosball, and N64 Mario Kart all to the tunes of some of the best/worst pop music of the 90's. The music choices here are bizarre and amazing and they definitely accept your most embarrassing requests from your childhood. Every night here has ended in a late night dance party, I only wish they were open later.",

In the case of The Old School Yard, I knew it was a fun bar with great cocktails and great party music, what I didn't know is that hidden below the main bar is an underground cellar with two karaoke rooms. Oh yes ladies and gent, I did do my rendition of Big Spender and Word Up (youtube.com/watch?v=MZjA\u2026) was performed by a certain superstar. As far as a night goes, if you are looking for a dirty dive bar party, this is the place for you. Great drinks and perfect music if you are up for cheesy dancing. The amazing thing about this place to is that it isn't full of tourists and you can actually get a drink at the bar without getting groped.",

I had my 25th birthday party here (the first birthday party I've ever had!), regularly 'drag' friends here, and have even been lucky enough to attend a Qype/My Kind Of Phone event here. So why do I love this place so much? Environment: When I first ever walked in here, I was utterly wowed from the off. There is old style arcade games, a big projector screen that usually has the Wii hooked up to it, a table football table, mis-matched sofas, and a very well stocked bar. Outside there is a 'playground', with ample seats, a tiny patch of grass and if you're lucky a BBQ going. The downstairs bar (which I was in for said event) is an ecclectic mix of bar paraphanelia and tucked away corners. Staff: The bar staff are very friendly, up for a chat and a lark around, will suggest drinks if you're not sure what you want, and are just all round fab. Drinks: The real selling point for this place. A great selection of cocktails, themed by school subject (e.g. Singapore Sling under geography, Pimms Cup under English), and these guys really know how to mix their drinks. Best of all, every day before 8 and all day Sunday, cocktails are only \u00a34.50 each! If I had to be picky on anything for this place, I would say that the toilets are a little pokey. But after a Pornstar Martini or 5 (my favourite drink), who cares?",

    "text": "What can I write here to do the Old School Yard justice? It is simply the most outstanding place I can imagine having for a local bar. While it does good business especially Friday and Saturday nights with its great cocktails, friendly bar tenders, comfy couches, and dance floor, you'd be hard pressed to find scenesters, hipsters, bankers...most ers, really. The crowd is an eclectic mix of locals who love to come together to chill while being assaulted by the amazing, usually 80s and 90s, tunes that don't stop and great cocktails. Last Friday, my girlfriend and I took some out-of-town friends there promising good music and American bar food, and we did not stop dancing even as we downed two of their Ninja Turtles-themed pizza. I even tried to take a break by playing the original TMNT arcade game (yes) but I could not. What I did do is stumble downstairs to finally check out the karaoke (yes) and if is like a whole second bar down there in the basement. On the way to the dance floor, while you sip on rum punch or any of their classic or newfangled cocktails, you might be tempted to challenge a friend or stranger to Mario Kart 64 (yes), and near the end of the night you might get a free shot of something for fun's sake. Oh and do take advantage of the free stuff you might get by checking in on Yelp. Wouldn't want to miss that. As if this place could get any better. Yes, most definitely the current front runner for next birthday venue. I only wish it closed like one hour later on weekends.",

    "text": "The Old School Yard was awesome. I spent most of my time in the room downstairs and the backyard, so my review will be of these areas. Staff were friendly, and the cocktails were fantastic. The French bartender in the room downstairs was on fire (not literally, of course), making customised cocktails for anyone who wanted one. This involved you telling him what you liked, and, more importantly, what you didn't like, and he'd concoct a cocktail designed to titillate your tastebuds. Surprisingly enough, while I didn't take part in the snake tournament (I arrived late, yes, that's my excuse), I found myself revisiting my childhood by playing Streets of Rage on the X-Box in the room with the big-screen TV. Absolutely awesome. I loved playing that game when I was a kid, and I still love it now. Beating someone up - whether it's a bad guy or your partner (accidentally) - is always good fun. And - I may be the only one to think so - but the downstairs room was rather Jamaican to me. Maybe because it was all the barrels? I don't know, it just gave off that vibe! The backyard was really nice, especially given the hot weather which had turned the downstairs room a little bit too humid. It wasn't too smoky, and it was a great place to chill out and catch up with friends, old and new alike. When I was leaving the bar, I walked through a group of obviously happy regulars who had started singing and dancing on the bartop. Seemed like a really good atmosphere all round!",
