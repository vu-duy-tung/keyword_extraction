Unlike so many gastro pubs where you pay restaurant prices and get fast food dishes, the engineer obviously has a very talented chef.Its a lovely stop off for the walk from camden to regent's park and if you smoke there is a terrace out the back. Ring ahead though, it gets very busy witht he rich Primrose Hill set!Never had a problem with service, as suggested above. Its a payday treat kind of place.",

    "text": "Had a very disappointing experience here. Had friends in town and wanted to treat them to a classic British sunday roast. We arrived and told the waitress (Antonia) we had booked a table she said she'd seat us and then promptly sat down at a table and started to talk to the patrons. I would later learn that this is her thing she does to try and ingratiate herself with customers while taking their money so as to ease the bitterness of paying her the \"discretionary\" 12.5% tip on the bill. After an awkward few minutes of the four of us staring at each other and wondering if she was going to get up and seat us we just walked in and sat ourselves. About 15 minutes later she came to take our orders. We ordered roasts and drinks and after waiting another ten or so minutes (the place was not packed) we asked someone else for our drinks. Soon we were playing a game of asking every person that walked by for our drinks and our food. Everyone we saw was looking frustrated and rolling their eyes at how long it was taking to get waited on, get drinks, etc. I'm always surprised given I believe these restaurants make so much of their money on the markup of alcohol when a place like this makes it so hard to get a drink. The food was exceptional with one exception. The potatoes that came with my roast pork were clearly many, many hours old. They tasted rubbery like when you reheat roast potatoes in the microwave the day after you make a roast. For the price we paid it is reasonable to expect some decent roast potatoes. I was actually shocked given all the positive reviews. Was very disppointed with our visit. Probably won't be going back anytime soon.",

Or you could say it is more like a restaurant attached to a pub. The decoration is beautiful, but nothing too fancy. The food is modern British cuisine with a twist with a good selection of wines. So delicious. Unfortunately the word has spread around so you need to make a table reservation..The place gets busy but still manages to bee relaxed and service has always been good. There is a lovely beer garden during the summers as well.The pub is located on the beautiful Primrose Hill area ( Where Kate Moss lives) and is surrounded by these cute pastel colored houses. If you have some energy left then it might be worth climbing on top of the actual hill and you can have a view over the entire London.",

I'm annoyed, surprised and most of all hungry. \"We'll wait,\" I say, utterly confused as to why this crazy has decided to take out her life frustrations on two people asking for a table. V spots an empty table and asks if it's available...Dolores rushes over to stand in front of nearly hysterically yelling \"someone may have reserved this! I don't know!

The food looked really interesting but came really in real small proportions, and at \u00a316 for a main, \u00a0its not value for money. Our table was facing the bar and I got to see the bar lady whoop up an excellent melon cocktail, and yes it was overpriced.To drink at the Engineer, you are paying above the odds just for the location.Inside, the Engineer actually looks like a local pub, but it takes itself far too seriously. \u00a0The food might be good, but the accompanying price tag is less appealing and coming here for a simple drink keeps this place a local favourite. Well over half the pub's space is devoted exclusively to eating and it is one of Londons fist Gastro pubs.I just love the location and the whole area and it is also a lovely looking building. Prepare to pay above the odds",

At nearly \u00a310, it's a bit pricey for breakfast, but they are nice and fluffy and come with the most amazing honey butter (never heard of such a thing before but now I don't know how I ever enjoyed pancakes without it!). The bacon is always nice and crispy, too. And they make a good cup of coffee. It's a pretty funky pub, too. Lots of crazy, colourful neo-Victorian wallpaper and a nice back garden with heaters. As far as drinks go, it's one of the best places to go for a quiet drink in the neighbourhood. There are always people there, but never so many that you can't find a table, though be prepared for a bit more craziness if you're looking to get lunch on the weekend. It's especially nice to stop by if you can work in a walk on Regent's Canal or over at Primrose Hill.",

    "text": "Super gastropub in Primrose Hill. There's a small proper pub area in front with some choice ales. Behind (and upstairs) are about three or four rooms with tables for dining. It's a popular spot for a weekend brunch or a celebratory dinner, though they're open right from 9am every day for breakfast. Not cheap. The dinner mains are in the \u00a313 to \u00a315 range, with starters and desserts around \u00a36 or \u00a37. It's all exceptional food, though. I think the Engineer was one of the first on the gastropub trend. Certainly everything I've had here, from starter to pudding, has been top quality, both tasty and well-presented. It's definitely worth calling to book a table, as it's a north London favourite and can get extremely busy. You can book one of two rooms for events (no charge, but there is a minimum spend). They also have a small kids' menu. I have heard some people complain about the service here. I think this is down to two things: (1) it can get very busy, making it difficult for servers to be instantly attentive to everyone, and (2) it can be quite crowded, and so attempts to move/add chairs often result in requests to put them back because they block the way. In my experience these type of interactions have always been professionally handled.",

A great sense of humour - lovely staff - and the food was excellent to boot. I'd say that they've taken note of the reviews of poor service scattered about online and pulled their socks up.My *only* gripe was the state of their toilets - shoddy. Given the great effort that they put in to all other areas - it wouldn't take much to give the toilets a punchy makeover to put them in keeping with the high standards found outside of them.All in all - they've clearly gotten rid of the poor staff letting them down and the food was top notch.",

Really??? While there seems to be good atmosphere and some cool private rooms upstairs there are too many good pubs in London to go back.",

The pub is huge with a nice cozy bar area with comfy chairs; they have a large outdoor space as well for a \u00a0nice sunny day. The upstairs has a large room that caters for big gatherings/event with a long oak table across the room. It's a gastro pub so the food is amazing, the chargrilled lamb was definitely a good choice and the Ox cheek with wine sauce. He portions are big and they do Sunday roast as well. The staff are super friendly and relaxed, you can stay as long as you want and they even have classic games like Jenga, Connect Four, Guess who that guests can use.

The padron peppers were both soggy and burnt (not a great combo), totally unseasoned and did not seem at all fresh which was super disappointing as they are one of my favourite dishes. The calamari just plainly left a lot to be desired.The worst were the mains - my husband had a burger and I had sausages and mash. The burger had clearly been frozen - or was just really poor quality meat. The sausages were the same - although they were supposedly 'free range' they definitely tasted frozen/not fresh and were burnt on the outside and not as cooked as I would have liked on the inside - I couldn't even eat the majority of them.We had intended to order dessert initially, but after having a very unsatisfactory meal we decided against it. Such a shame, as I heard that the pub used to have great food when it was under previous ownership. We may come back here for a drink on the outdoor patio in the summer, but have been left with a bitter taste in our mouths and certainly won't be returning for a meal.",

As it was conveniently just north of Regent's Park, I headed up here to meet a couple of friends and watch the opening ceremonies. We happily discovered it was part of the London Drink Deck (\u00a37 if you spend \u00a320 on food and drink) and even more happily ordered a round and some nibbles.The cocktails got good reviews from the girls and the double fried chips (my assumption) were excellent. Despite not wanting to eat much, I polished off the bowl. The scotch eggs looked alright but as my preference is for scotch sans egg I didn't try them myself.Extra points to the Engineer staff for regularly coming around and checking if we needed more drinks and food. It's rare to get table service on the slowest of nights when you are tucked away in an upstairs room, but during a busy time such as the opening ceremonies it's damn near unheard of.Other thoughts: They have a table tennis table somewhere on the upstairs floor as I heard it but didn't see it. Limited bathroom capacity means you're likely to have to wait, particularly for the ladies. Overall, a nice pub after a day (or night) in the Park if you happen to be in the area but not enough of a draw for the trek alone.",

    "text": "This place was exactly what five people with empty stomachs needed before venturing to Screen on the Green in Islington for a late night viewing of Evil Dead. \u00a0We were in the neighbourhood after showing a couple London visitors the view from Primrose Hill and, after a few drinks at a non-descript pub, decided to take our chances on dinner at Engineer. \u00a0As we walked, I was convinced we wouldn't find a table and would be stuck in the cold with no other plans, but when we walked in the door we saw an empty round table big enough for all of us. \u00a0It was a Halloween miracle. \u00a0I'm looking at the receipt as I type and, I have to say, we tasted a lot - in terms of food & booze - and the tab was \u00a3200 for 5 people including a \u00a32.50 donation to The Hope Foundation and 12.5% service. \u00a0I usually stay away from cocktails because I turn into a crazy person, but the menu (pasted into a copy of 101 Dalmations) was too tasty to ignore. \u00a0I imbibed the English Autumn Cobbler (good, but tasted more like spring), and two Jack Brambles. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0My husband had a Black Velvet so he could drink out of a pewter mug (not really worth the \u00a39) and our friend Danielle went for a few shots of Talisker. \u00a0If you're looking for beer or cider, they have that too, because the bill also includes quite a few Alddlestons, St Peters, and Bombardier pints. \u00a0The real star of the show, however, was the food. \u00a0Not one to order steak in the UK (always too thin and chewy), I went for it on the recommendation of the waitress. \u00a0I'm so glad I did. \u00a0It one of the top two steaks I've had since moving here over a year ago (the other being at the top floor of Smiths of Smithfield). \u00a0 Thickly cut, on the bone, perfectly cooked...I'm drooling just thinking about it. \u00a0The chips were great too, but I was more interested in picking up the meat like a lollipop and gnawing at it as if I were a wild dog. \u00a0It didn't come cheap - \u00a324 to be exactly - but in my mind it was worth every penny. \u00a0My husband had the spinach soup, which he loved and I agree was very tasty. \u00a0It wasn't overpowered with cream and had a nice bright green colour and taste to it. \u00a0Floating in the middle was a poached egg. \u00a0The only disappointment was the boring slice of bread served with it. \u00a0A few seconds on the grill would have made it worth dunking, but instead it was taken back to the kitchen with the empty plates. \u00a0One of my friends had the pie of the day, which was venison. \u00a0The top of the pie was puffed over the plate so perfectly that I think someone took a photo. \u00a0After piercing the pastry, the chunks of meat inside were meltingly soft. \u00a0Other things that were ordered, but I didn't try, were smoked haddock and the pasta of the day. \u00a0The only scrap of food left on any of the plates was that one piece of bread that came with the soup. \u00a0 Do I see myself returning? \u00a0I can't wait.",

    "text": "This is too much a gastro pub (virtually a restaurant), not ideally a place to come and drink (especially at 3.80 a pint!). My pint of St Peters bitter was decent though. The toilets are upstairs, which is worth remembering. I saw a lot of people, including myself, struggling to find them. A lot of people below seem to really like this part of London but I just don't like it.",

I want to pick this place up and move it closer to me. My two friends and I all got on their wifi (\"letmeontheweb\") with our phones during dinner. What more can you ask for :)",
