They take the time and consideration to make sure that their food is of good standard and quality which is why they have such a good reputation. They have a vast selection of coffees and sandwiches which won't disappoint! I recommend them as they cater to many different people and also have a vegetarian menu and a slim menu.",

Being allergic to onion as well there isn't a lot I can eat out of their salad selection either so I usually end up getting a free range egg and spinach pot. those things are lifesavers. They have recently bought out almond milk drinks - date and cacao and cashew and banana. I was very excited. and then I tasted them. They do not taste good. ..... ugh they're so close but not quite there, so frustrating. .Let me help Pret! Let me help you get this thing right!! Start with labelling items that are gluten free, dairy free etc like you label the vegetarian options. With no ingredients list on the packaging we have no way if knowing the food is safe.

We love their croissants and porridge (with sliced banana!) and spend no more than 10 pounds for the two of us. Sometimes we'll buy a couple of their packaged sandwiches (3-4 pounds each) for lunch later. They also have desserts like chocolate mousse, banana cake, lemon cake, etc. These are around 2-3 pounds. All in all, a great variety at great prices! And... they're everywhere!Also, very clean bathrooms located downstairs.",

Over the years, the Pret range has expanded so there are soups and hot wraps for cold days, as well as pastries and decent coffee for breakfast. Most shops offer an eat-in area, and staff are famously friendly and pleasant. The only downside: sandwiches do run out in the afternoon, so the choice can be limited towards the end of the day.",

    "text": "2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 239/365Pret A Manger IS AWESOMEEEE! My dad and I were staying at a hotel down the street, and were looking for a cheap, easy place to go to for breakfast during our 5-day stay in London. There were a ton of bakeries and cafes along Piccadilly Circus, but we decided to go to Pret A Manger since it looked pretty good. This was one of the best discoveries we found whilst in London! SO good that we went back EVERY single morning for breakfast while we were there!My dad and I had never heard of Pret A Manger before. It's pretty similar to Starbucks, except the selection of food is WAY BETTER! They had coolers and shelves all along one entire wall with different bottled juices, waters, beverages, pastries, sandwiches, soups, etc. Perfect for anybody who is on the go and wants a fresh, portable meal! We noticed a LOT of people stopped by Pret on their way to work, as many people were in business attire and looked like they wanted to get in and out as soon as possible. The Pret employees cater to their customers by working FAST! They all look like busy little worker ants trying to get everything done as quickly as possible which was great.The first time I went I ordered the pina colada smoothie which was unfortunately a major bust. Not good at all...blech. However, I started ordering the hot chocolate which was deeelicious. Better than the hot chocolate normally served at coffee shops in the US. My biggest and best discovery from Pret A Manager was their CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS! They are SO. GOOD. I normally don't like croissants in general, but there was something that I just LOVED about Pret's! I also got my dad hooked on them and he started ordering them everyday too! :P My dad's favorite item from Pret A Manger was their ham, cheese and tomato pastry. They were made fresh every morning and he LOVED them. This location was the first Pret A Manger we ever saw while in London, but we soon realized that it is a VERY popular chain in England, and saw them on almost every street corner. Even more popular than Starbucks which is saying something!If Pret existed in the US, my dad and I would probably be regulars. Amazing coffee shop with really good food! I highly recommend for anyone who wants a quick, easy, and cheap breakfast/brunch! :)",

Keep in mind that prices are more expensive if you eat in. So grab it to go and head to St James, Kensington, or Hyde Park and enjoy.I personally recommend the duck and hoisson wrap and the Salmon and edamae cup.....wonderful.",

I had a seasonal turkey and cranberry sandwich while my friend had the duck wrap. My sandwich was really good and I would get it again if I have the chance. Overall Pret has some pretty health and good food when you're on the go and have to grab something quick!",

It has a delicious range of healthy food including salads, sandwiches, sushi, fruit and other assorted items. Their hot drinks were perfect for the cold winter days and they even have hot soups and pastas to go. It's fairly affordable and was our \"go to\" place whenever we were hungry. I would highly recommend this franchise to anyone in London. I'm only sad that it doesn't yet exist here in New Zealand :(",

I recently stayed in Mayfair and this was my closest Pret, easy walking distance to Green Park and the hotel that I was staying in.Nothing beats the fresh muesli and the chicken & avocado sandwich and mango smoothie.I wish Pret was a bit closer to me here in Australia!",

    "text": "Although much copied, I still think Pret a Manger are leaders in what they do: a highly consistent chain of sandwich shops, selling generously-filled sandwiches with high quality, fresh and natural ingredients. (All sandwiches are made on the premises, fresh each day). There are good choices for vegetarians (I especially like their vegetable crisps, made from root vegetables others than spuds). They're a bit pricier than some other chains, but worth it in my view. This branch in Piccadilly is useful to know as it's not too rushed at lunchtimes, and is open seven days a week.",
