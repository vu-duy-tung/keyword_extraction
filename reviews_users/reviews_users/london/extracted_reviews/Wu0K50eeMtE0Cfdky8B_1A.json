    "text": "This tiny tapas bar opened recently in Covent Garden, taking the place of one of Neal Street's old cake shops. Initially it doesn't look like much - the few tapas samples sitting out in the window didn't particularly tempt me - but having been persuaded in by a friend I was very glad I gave it a try. The wine here is served in authentic Spanish style stemless glasses, and is probably the best thing about Pix. There's a good selection of top quality stuff, at reasonable prices. The pintxos themselves are also pretty good, tasty and fresh, and made a great accompaniment to the wine. The best time to visit this branch of Pix is in the summer, when you can sit out on the pavement in the bustle of Neal Street's shoe shopping crowd. We felt like we could easily have been in Madrid or Barcelona as we say there enjoying Pintxos on a sunny spring day. Great for an antidote to shopping! Pix gets pretty busy and lively on Friday and Saturday nights, so be there early to avoid disappointment (table space is quite limited). But the staff are really accommodating and offered us two whole plates of free tapas after a bottle of wine (which they also replaced) was corked. Definitely above the call of duty!",

The pintxos were about \u00a32.50-3, complemented by a stellar wine list. The staff are very nice as well. I'm kind of hoping that it doesn't get too popular because it is such a cute, small space!",

There used to be another one in Westbourne Grove as well, but it is now closed down. Another bar/cafe has taken its place. Every time I pass by, it is packed. It must be good. I am sure to pay a visit there sometime too. We got there around 3pm, so lunch time was over and it was pretty empty. I heard it does get really busy during lunch and dinner times. For the price and the food served, Pix-Bar will be on low-mid end food bar. Food was well made and tasted good, however nothing to shout about. Very affordable. Within \u00a330 we able to have 8 pintxos and half a bottle of Manzanilla. Excellent place to get together with some friends for some drinks and nibbles. Definitely recommend it. I will definitely come here again. However, I will also like to try its sister bar at Covent Garden. I will write all about it when I do. thehungrybea.com/2012/02\u2026 TheHungryBea.com",

    "text": "Inspired by the pintxo bars of Barcelona, Pix offers loads of different food options with only two prices. Those with small sticks sticking out of them cost \u00a32.25 and the big ones \u00a33.25 which makes adding up your bill super simple. After a couple portions of patatas bravas to share between us while we waiting for drinks we checked out the days offerings.I went with the Serrano ham on tomato bread, diablo meatballs, Serrano ham & bechemal croquetas and the four cheese fritter. Some items were better than others and while the meatballs were delicious the bread that came with it and also the Serrano ham was a bit of a let down. My absolute favourite dish however were the cheese fritters, crispy on the outside while still being wonderfully gooey on the inside - truly delicious!I could have quite happily gone back for more but of course wanted to save room for not only the cava we were drinking but a cheeky little pudding too! The churros with chocolate sauce were the bomb and an absolute bargain at the short stick price.I may have got sugar absolutely EVERYWHERE trying to eat these in a half polite manner but man were they worth it. The sauce wasn't really a sauce though, more like milkshake which made an excellent chaser at the end of the meal. In total the bill came to around \u00a320 each including drinks which for central London is pretty much unheard of. \u00a0I for one am a definite convert!",

    "text": "Pix is a very decent tapas bar mini-chain exclusive to London. I've visited the Covent Garden (Neal St) and Notting Hill locations. The concept is great. You sit down, make yourself comfortable, maybe order a drink from the waiter, then get up to pick out your tapas. They offer a range of traditional tapas like albondigas, cured meats, chorizo and vegetable options which are all skewered. You collect skewers as you go, making as many trips as you'd like to the counter with the constantly replenished food. At the end, you pay for skewers and drinks and voila. It's a great option if you want some authentic tapas at your own pace.I generally like the concept of Pix, but beware, the space is very small and can feel like you're packed like sardines in a can or the tube on your morning commute, so not always the most pleasant of dining experiences. I wouldn't recommend this for groups (unless you book out the entire restaurant), and would always advise booking ahead.",

Everything is in small portions and you can pick up which food items you want to eat from the bar area. The total cost depends on the number of cocktail sticks that you accumulate. I think they may need a better system for this- it's a little too trusting in my opinion since it would be easy enough for customers to discard the sticks and avoid paying the full cost of what they ate (!) In addition to the yummy tapas, there is also a good drink selection.Note that the restaurant is very small and more suited to small groups of 2/3!",

My only complaint is that at the time there were a large amount of fritters, which are of course fried...BUT all the food is on a rotation so you can just sit back and enjoy another glass of wine while you wait for some new selections.The following items were consumed (in order of tastiness): - Seared Tuna on toasted bread- Chorizo w/ manchego Cheese- Ham and tomato on toasted bread (lovely thing strips of smoked ham)- Spinach and Sweet Potato 'cakes'- Aubergine Fritter w/ Cherry Tomato- Olives and tomatosThere is a bit of an honor system involved. Each selection comes with a 'pick' stuck in them and this is how your meal is totalled up at the end of your grazing session. I highly recommend this spot - if you are in the area you MUST try it.",

Tastes delicious.So you can imagine my excitement when I walked into Pix for a quick lunchtime nibble and rather then having to wait for my tapas to arrive, there were an array of Basque-style pintxos sitting and waiting to be plucked up from the bar. Plump juicy olives, meatballs, quince-coated chorizo on manchego cheese, pork belly with apple and smoked potato, cod and crab croquetas, Iberico ham and zucchini... and that was just in the initial grab-sesh. I noticed a beautiful display of Spanish wines, and as we were the only people sitting along the window, we got to sample a few cocktails they were testing. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, hey? \u00a0If you've never enjoyed this Northern Spanish treat, pintxos are different from tapas in the way they are presented and eaten. While tapas are more of a sit down, get cosy, fork-frolicing long-term affair, pintxos are more of a social butterfly -- reasonably large, but individual bites consisting of a small slice of bread with a wide variety of Spanish goodness on top, served on a long, thin skewer. (Pintxo = spike. Clever, huh?) If this is blowing your mind, compare pintxos to a sushi-go-round where you're grabbing, nibbling, grabbing again and then being charged per colourful plate, rather than a sit down, order from a menu sushi restaurant. Or you could just go and check it out for yourself! (That goes for Pix and Basque Country alike.)",

I was a bit iffy of the idea at the beginning, but once i got eating... It was great ( I even went back up for more). The staff are great and one girl (the manager, I think) even took the time to chat amicably with me during a quiet afternoon. Hope to go back again.",

We had window seats at the very front of the restaurant, which was just perfect for people watching.Had some lovely cocktails and the tapas was great. More fresh food was delivered up to the bar every few minutes and I had to really stop myself from over-indulging.Would have given 5 stars but the barman completely forgot to bring us a round of drinks. He was very apologetic when I eventually managed to get his attention and remind him and they were all rushed off their feet. But overall, very good.",

Covent Garden houses a lot of wolves in sheep's clothing. It seems tempting, but often disappointing. Yes, you'll be in and out in time for the show -- but at what expense? Lost quality, I tell you. Rawr. So, Pix. A petite little alcove on Neal Street, positioned perfectly to whet your whistle and fill your belly. Pix (pinxtos) are small plates. These are all fired up and ready to go for you, immediately. You take what you want, you eat what you can, they tally up the sticks at the end and voila you'll leave pretty satisfied. Oh, and that chocolate espresso mousse? Do not forget to devour one. I implore you. I've been twice, and both times the service is downright cheerful in the best Spanish way. You feel at home, it's a comfortable spot, relaxed. The wine and drinks flow, the food is never late, they whip up fresh batches as things disappear, even doing some rounds to make sure you have what you need. Very enjoyable. I do recommend a booking for busy show nights as they do book up. Tables turn fast, but you don't want to be left without your Pix fix. So, repeat after me. NO PRIX FIXE -- JUST PIX. NO PRIX FIXE - JUST PIX! you got it. *Infinity Sundays - all you can eat and drink for \u00a333/person. Come hungry and thirsty and get your infinity life on.",

But the fried cod balls tasted like faintly fishy dough balls and were disappointing. All the bruschetta variations were meh. Nothing stood out as amazing so we didn't even bother with dessert.

All sounds great so far, and perfect for a date! I think the cocktails themselves let it down a bit though. The bartenders were the same as the restaurant upstairs and clearly not mixologists. Nice, but your average - slightly over sweet and mainstream - fare. If they sorted that out I would be there all the time!",

    "text": "Food was good however, this is definitely a 3 pound sign place. If you're American it's probably the most expensive tapas place you'll go to in London due to the tiny sizes. \u00a0for average people expect 4 to 6 large pix and a couple small. \u00a0Overall, the food was tasty but a severe lack of hot dishes. A great pre- or post-theater snack. Almost everything is on a crustini which is very not Spanish, but has a great fusion flare!",
