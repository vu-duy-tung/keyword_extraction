The starters excel despite my inability to spell any of them, from the creamy yogurt cacik to delightfully smoky baba ganoush. The mains are large and generally quite good.

There is not much to pick between the three restaurants, they are all pretty much as good as each other, which is lucky as if one is full - and they get very busy - you can always try one of the others. The Turkish food is excellent value, large portions (you can bring boys here and they'll be happy) and the vibe is really lively and fun. Lots of people come for birthdays and other big celebrations so it's probably not the place to come for an intimate tete-a-tete. The tables are fairly closely packed so you can find yourself being slightly drawn into other people's revelry but not in a hellish TFI Friday sort of way.",

The Mediterranean d\u00e9cor inside really created a cozy and authentic ambiance, perfect atmosphere for a good catch up with friends.I ordered a cappuccino and a turkey, ham, cheese panini. The coffee tasted very diluted and on the burnt side, and the panini was quite standard though I have to say it leant towards being greasy. Thankfully this was partially saved by a bit of salad on the side with a vinaigrette! For just under \u00a37, I have to say it's not bad. I think I would probably have had better luck ordering their specialities though.The staff were great and did not hurry to rush us out despite the caf\u00e9 being quite busy. So despite the food not being quite so tantalising for my taste buds, the caf\u00e9 is a great joint to just have a long conversation. Since I was quite full by the end of it, I didn't quite make it to the sweet things that caught my eye, perhaps next time I will skip the lunch and go straight to the cakes!",

I counted at least three big prawns, four mussels, and about four substantial chunks of various kinds of fish (I spotted tuna, salmon and swordfish). Lots of nice bits of vegetables in there as well, and the rice was deliciously flavored. There was also a side salad of rocket and cucumber that went really well with the savory paella.

Turkish food is very much meat, rice, and vegetables. \u00a0It's tasty, it's simple, it's relatively healthy. \u00a0Gallipoli does a great job.2.) The restaurant is conveniently designed to remind tall people how drunk they are due to the bells and various other accoutrement hanging at head height throughout the venue.3.) The restaurant is conveniently designed to encourage drinking due to awesome cozy atmosphere and friendly waiters.4.) The restaurant is conveniently designed to maintain drunkenness due to free shots handed out by dancing waiters after 11 PM on Saturday nights.5.) The restaurant is conveniently designed to confuse drunken Australians due to the fact that there are three Gallipoli restaurants on Upper St.6.) The restaurant is conveniently designed to embarrass drunken Australians by providing Turkish apparel and a chair upon which to dance.7.) The restaurant is conveniently named so as to allow drunken Australians to expostulate on Australia's worst military campaign in history.Hurrah for convenience!",

The main dishes that we had were simple and well-cooked, but frankly, you can get the same kebab in basically every corner in London. The dessert list is a joke...The only Turkish item is a (horrible) baklava and there is a choice of \"European\" items like Profiteroles(wtf?). These guys could just send someone with a bus to nearby Green Lanes and get some baklava for their store. But I guess, why bother? In addition to that, they do not offer Turkish tea (due to lack of space, according to one of the waiters). That is a big success, since this is the first (out of many around the world) Turkish restaurants that does not offer the traditional tea. Even my Turkish barbers in London serve such tea!",

Apparently \"Gallipoli\" is Turkish for gluttony and that's alllllllright by me. All around good times.",

Two such groups were there when we were, and the waitstaff encouraged them to celebrate by dancing on their chairs.

It's always good, there's always loads of food, and the bill is always cheaper than I think it's going to be, considering I feel I can only roll out of the door. Perfect for a group dinner, just order all the meze you fancy, add a couple extra dishes for luck, and you're away. I've never had anything bad. The main courses are great too, if you can fit them in. The decor is cool as well, though you might not think so if you like 'minimalist chic'!Beware, if you have your birthday here they do actually make you stand on a chair and dance awkwardly while they sing.....

There are three of Gallipoli's - two serve Turkish while the remaining one serves Turkish and Lebanese. Not sure if they serve Shisha but they had the setup though.In terms if food, try anything with Moussaka (mezze or mains) its great, the meat dishes especially large mix meat is perfect of you wish to try different types lamb and chicken they offer, felafel is decent but the dips are fantastic. Pamukkale white and Cankaye wines for vegetarian dishes (or if drinking only) is great. Pamukkale red and Yakut greatly compliments the meat dishes.If you dont fancy drinking alcohol, quench your thirst try with Ayran (very similar to buttermilk). It's generally a summer drink and helps hydrate and cool the body (okay, too technical, drink what you like).Havnt tried the sweets yet (I know, such a shame but get stuffed with starters and mains every single time). Give yourself a couple of hours as this place with its the delicious food, great decor (all three have a different element to them) and friends make a wonderful memory.P.S. - One of the good places to impress your date if she is big on food and eastern ambience.",

The lamb was flavorful, koete was a little spicy (a nice change with all the Chinese food I've had) and matched with the pita bread it was fantastic. The rice with what I think is lentils had an interesting texture and the salad had a vinagette that tastes home made.

Had a couple of cocktails to whet the appetite. Shared a Gallipoli meze and some halloumi cheese, which was nice although perhaps might have been better to have the meze items in separate dishes as the couple next to us did as it got messy on one plate. Had the 102 Upper Street special as a main dish, which consisted of lamb kofte, chicken pieces and lamb pieces with rice and salad. Kofte was a bit too charred for my liking, though. Rocking atmosphere with a few large parties - bartender stood on the bar and did the Gangnam style! Would recommend but avoid prime time (Fri, Sat evening) if you want a quieter dinning experience. Just over \u00a350 (inc. 10% service) for two including a couple of cocktails was possibly a bit pricy for what it was considering we were heading to the local cinema afterwards. Wasn't blown away by the food, but an enjoyable meal nonetheless.",

After about 15 minutes waiting by the door we were seated, but we were alright with it because we weren't in a rush.It was made up for anyway. We sat down and they immediately took a great interest in our comfort and leisure, served us quickly and were very friendly and chatty. The waiter even made a couple of jokes about people on dates like any nice waiter would to break the ice a little bit.Later, when he apologised for the wait I asked if he could throw in a bit of free flatbread to make up for it. He happily agreed to and it was delicious with some fantastic hommous.The Chicken & Potato dish was fantastic, as was the Lamb Variant, and the Dolmades worked very nicely as a starter, even to my date, a Turkish food newbie.The fact that they were so good to customers as soon as they were actually customers meant more than just trying to woo new customers into coming in, I think, and the food more than made up for it anyway. Good job, Gallipoli!",

    "text": "Amazing food and ultra-pleasant service. Be prepared to feast like a king while paying prole prices.Really, all you need to know is to order the Set Meal 1. It comes in two waves - one of cold mezzes, then one of hot mezzes. At least two people in your party must order it at ~\u00a311 each, but it's more than satisfying.Winners of the set had to be the juicy mitite kofte (which went exceptionally well with the yogurty manca) and the simple, but satisfying humus. Sometimes the standards are just what you need. Also, if a server asks you if you want the chili sauce, say \"Yes, please!\" early and often. I kind of wanted to buy a tub of it to take home!Though we were in a rush to leave to scoot on to our next destination, we were each graciously offered a sample of baklava as we piled out the door. Not only did they fill us up, but they sent us packing with one for the road. How can you -not- love a place like that?NB: Be sure to arrive early. It turns out that all of the Gallipolis are quite popular with the weekend dinner crowd.",

The restaurant has an authentic flair with all its decorations and the staff is Mediterranean, so that I though I was on vacation (one can dream right?). I am a pescetarian, so I greatly appreciated their great veggie options, but first the hummus was delicious!! In fact everything was delicious and I was there with a group of 10 or so. We all had different things and not one person had less to say than 'amazing'! The prices are also very reasonable (main dishes are less than \u00a310) especially since it is located on Upper Street in Angel.I would definitely recommend this place for people well everyone, unless you don't like Mediterranean food, but if you're going with more than 3/4 people I would make a reservation beforehand, cuz the place is pretty small!I'll be back soon and dragging everyone of my visitors there!!",

    "text": "A Turkish Valentine's Delight.After months & months of walking by, peering in, continued walking, and regret for not stopping - we finally went to Gallipoli for a Valentine's dinner and whoa what a dinner it turned out to be.1st thing that jumps out at you in Gallipoli is the decor. Turkish/Moroccan lamps hanging from the ceiling (I'm tall & hit my head) and old pictures & artifacts from past empires.I couldn't tell if I was in Bzyantium, Constantinople, or Istanbul - - but I knew it was somewhere in the eastern portion of present-day Turkey, which coincidentially enough is called Gallipoli.Our first decision was the wine - which we immediately chose this Turkish white that turned out to be substantially better than I was expecting from a country not known for the vineyards.Then the 2 course set-menus. Cold Mezze platter & Jumbo Grilled Prawns. Success. Lamb & Chicken grilled skeweres and a Meat Mousakka (spicy Turkish lasagna) Success. Food was off the hook and came in a portion the size of a 3 month old child. Success.Service was lightning quick. The staff provided me with ample assistance while catering to my novice knowledge of the Turkish language when inquiring about specific dishes on the menu.Food down. Turkish coffee brought to the table. Another success.When we paid the bill and were sitting letting the massive amount of Turkish delight fester within our abdomens - our server brought us over two complimentary glasses of god knows what in a fancy glass. Following a swift snap of my neck - the lightning water was quickly down the hatch and I was out the door leaving nothing but a phenominal experience behind me.Thank you Gallipoli.",

    "text": "Came here with some friends after watching a movie and hadn't realised just how many eateries were in the area! Luckily this one was also open till late as it was 10pm when we got out! We ended up sharing between the 3 of us, one main course, and 5 mezze platters. Luckily that was enough as we weren't too hungry, and although we did think of getting the sharing platters, at around 17 pounds PER PERSON after 5pm was just a bit too much.The mezze platters were decently sized, although you only get 3 falafel balls with a small splat of hummus for the mezze plate. However, the taramasalata was a good portion size and I assume all their mezze dip portions would be a healthy size as well. We didn't get extra pita bread, so I'm not sure if getting more would cost extra! But if you get some meaty mains, you could always just eat it with that....My third friend ordered a chicken main, which was also quite decent for the cost. However I think the amount of meat he got was about the same amount that you get on a mezze plate, just served with a side of rice, pita bread, 2 helpings of yoghurt dip and a kind of eggplant ragu. All in all the food was tasty and the service was good, but I think you're probably better off ordering several mezze platters and sharing that with at least one other person, if you're not eating on your own! But I guess if you're hungrier than that you could also add in a main course. It's always better to share anyway!",

Alas, I didn't have a big enough appetite to do justice to the menu, but if I ever get the chance I will return ravenous. The service is efficient and friendly, and you sit under a ceiling of low-hanging Middle-eastern lamps. A real Turkish delight.",

We particularly enjoyed the lima bean salad and the velvety hummos. The lamb was particularly tender. We would have ordered dessert but it was late and we were too full.

However if like me you live in North London we are very lucky to be spoilt with a number of excellent Turkish restaurants. If it's all about the food,portion size and cost then I suggest you head to Green Lanes where you can find a dozen places with portions double in size for half the price. Check out my review on Gokyazu which is a 10 minute walk from Manor House station. This place is great if on a night out in Islington or if you fancy heading to a lively buzzy restaurant in a cool part of London.",

For so much to eat, it's a great price that can't compare to other Turkish restaurants. Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is amazing. The plethora of hanging lamps gives out an ethnic, homey aura and even though it's constantly busy, you can sit in there for ages and enjoy the setting.

    "text": "This place holds a special place for me, it was the first place my now wife took me for dinner... The venue is suitably decorated with a Turkish theme, lights and pictures cover the walls, the tables are simple heavy wood with matching chairs. There are plenty of seats... Probably a few too many as you have to brush up against other diners to get to your seat.The staff are attentive but they have a job to do and aren't going to spend too much time chit chatting.The food.... It's good, the choice is really good and there are lots of traditional favourites. The meze starter we went for was tasty and had a good variety of choice. If I'm honest I wasn't blown away by anything we had but I would happily return (as I have done).Ok, so I've given it an average review but four stars??!... Well here's the best bit!!! If you check in on Yelp, you get 20% off!!!!!! There were no pre-conditions (we rocked up on a Saturday evening), just show them your screen and boom!!.. 20% off.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places in London and I came here relatively often. The food, Turkish, was very delicious, and the environment is friendly and comfortable. I enjoy all the dangling lamps, but I am also short so I never worried about hitting them. The appetizer I usually get is the hummus. As for entree, I have tried a variety of the dishes and kebabs, and nothing was ever disappointing. My favorite was the lamb kebab. The dessert here is good also.I have also been to Gallipoli Bazaar and Gallipoli Again. I have had great experiences in the other two as well.",

Went there for dinner with friends this weekend, we shared the meze, and I had the baked stuff aubergine as main (one of the few vegetarian entr\u00e9es). \u00a0The meze were nice, but the aubergine was disappointing: the vegetable stuffing contained canned corn, and the tomato sauce was bland and also tasted like it was straight out of a can. \u00a0 Perhaps I ordered the wrong entr\u00e9e, but probably won't return anytime soon.",

Staff don't overcrowd you and although the place is busy the tables are arranged so that you feel as if you are in your own cosy room. Decor makes you feel as if you are in someone's front room.",

    "text": "My flatmate and I came here for dinner on a lovely summer evening, where we got to sit outside on the slightly tilted sidewalk, right next to the bustling Upper Street. The interior of the restaurant is decorated with beautiful glass lanterns, but it was just too nice to not be outside. The staff were friendly and very happy to oblige when I brought my mobile phone in and asked them if I could charge it. We ordered a bottle of wine, and they were kind enough to open new bottles for me to try before I selected one (to my defense, they were all offered by the glass, and so I was surprised that they had to open new ones in order for me to try them). Still, that was extremely generous and I was impressed. We went with the house white wine and got a plate of the mixed meze to share as an appetizer. For mains, we both got the iskender, which is described as tender lamb, laid on pita, with creamy yogurt and secret recipe sauce. It was not at all like I imagined, but such a cool dish! The way that I would describe it is as barbecued pieces of lamb, which sits above the Middle Eastern version of a pasta dish. The secret recipe sauce was just like a tomato pasta sauce, and along with the yogurt, was like a tomato-and-cream blend, and the pita was chewy to the point that it no longer resembled pita at all - at first we thought it was gnocchi or pasta! The meal was extremely filling. Overall, I think this is a nice, casual, and inexpensive place to eat and not a bad Upper Street option.",
