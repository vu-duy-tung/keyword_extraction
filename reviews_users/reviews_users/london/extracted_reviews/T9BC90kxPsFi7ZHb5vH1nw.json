    "text": "What a gem of a place. An authentic Italian restaurant full of hustle and bustle. Lively, full of laughter and glorious!My friend absolutely raved about this restaurant. We're both Cali girls and randomly happened to find ourselves in London at the same time. Good friend, amazing city, yummy food & drinks makes for a splendid time. We were starving and arrived at the restaurant right before it opened. Of course the best way to pass time is to go to a local pub and order a few bottles of wine. Slightly tipsy, we were soon seated on the rooftop terrace. The tables are snuggled up pretty close, get cozy with your neighbor! It's an intimate setting without being crowded. Even though it was an early Summer evening (late July) the air had a touch of chill to it. Luckily, the space heaters warmed us up enough to enjoy the brisk air and take in the City while we dined. Of course we ordered several more bottles of wine. My friends were fans of the pizza. The pizza came out on long boards. You can order your pizza by the foot. We had several feet of pizza. I couldn't partake in the pizza eating due to my wheat allergy but the smell was absolutely divine. All of the ingredients were fresh. My friends oohed and aahed and moaned while they enjoyed their pizza. I ordered a salad with goat cheese. I wasn't exactly looking forward to it after smelling the pizza, I was envious of the pizza-eating fiends. While I waited for the the salad, I munched on the cheese and sausage from the pizza and joined in on the oohing and aahing. My salad took me by surprise. \u00a0I didn't realize that a simple goat cheese salad could also cause me to ooh and aah. I'm not going to lie to you, being from Los Angeles, I watch what I eat. There were heaps of goat cheese on my salad. Generally I would never consume that much cheese in a sitting, it's not exactly healthy. But this goat cheese was unreal -- without a doubt the best goat cheese eating experience of my life to date. I certainly didn't feel deprived while I inhaled my salad and my friends devoured their pizza.",

The pizzas are served by the meters if you order more than one at a time. The presentation is awesome, huge quantities, and the cheese+tomato sauce isn't the typically soggy, runny London pizza usually served. Top quality, great ambiance, but remember to call ahead and book a table- it's likely to be packed!",

    "text": "For me, this is a total summer restaurant. It has this great little roof terrace with really cosy tables packed in together, creating intimacy rather than body fluid sharing. It's done really well I think and they haven't forgotten heaters so even if it's normal British summer weather it feels better and hotter.Inside they've still tried to keep the cosyness and atmosphere, there are lots of separate levels and rooms so there's that constant bustle of lost people trying to find the loo. I'm always into the food too, the pizza is often served on a raised board and is perfect for sharing while the pasta is really tasty and the ingredients fresh. I often go with an Italian friend and often she's suggested it so I assume there's authenticity thrown in with the quality.",

For starters,we had Bruschetta which was very tasty (if a bit salty) and fried Calamari and prawns which were fresh and cooked to perfection. The main course was a seafood liguine and a pizza, both were fantastic, and the pasta was simply the best seafood pasta I have had in London. They told us that the pizza will be served as a 25 cm elongated portion, but they brought the usual round one. We had a seat near the entrance, and we heard many italian speaking commuters who come to book tables for later. Having italians coming to this restaurants rather than others would tell the whole story as I wouldn't think that nobody would know the italian food better than the italians themselves. If you are coming make a booking to avoid disappointment especially at busy times.",

    "text": "To put in simply, very few Italian restaurants in London have put as big a smile on my face as \"Made in Italy.\" Delicious and unique pizza, decent prices and good wine in a cosy and fun Italian setting. From a visual perspective alone, their signature \"Pizza Metro\" (served on metre-long wooden planks) is worth the trip. The pizzas also taste as good as they look, with fine ingredients and a few interesting combinations to boot. Of our 'metro' combination, I preferred the 'siciliana' over the 'ortolana' though the latter was far from disappointing.However, I've definitely had better pasta than their \"Pennette a Modo Nostro,\" so would recommend that you stick to their pizza (although I've heard they do great pasta and great salads if that's more your thing). A nice bottle of Montepulciano complemented the meal well, though I wish we hadn't followed the waitress' desert recommendation of the Tartufo Bianco (I think that's what it was called) and instead went for the home-made tiramisu, which looked amazing. All this (two pizzas, a pasta dish, bottle of wine and desert) came to 54 pounds (with service charge), which I think was good value and also reflected the reasonably prompt service.In short, I can't wait to go there again, and would be happy to recommend it to friends and pretty much anyone looking for a fun, casual and mouthwatering pizza experience.",

    "text": "Ooof. I was about to strike down 'Made in Italy' with great vengence and furious anger on Yelp, but an unexpected last-minute act of contrition from the manager saved them from 1 star shame. Still, plenty of room for improvement here:I swung by here for what I intended to be a swift supper, buoyed by the good reviews here and pleasant memories of a prior trip here years ago. In planning to order two benchmark products for an Italian restaurant - a margerita pizza and tiramisu - I didn't think I was asking a huge amount from them. Cue problem number 1: the service. It took them 10 mins to take my order and then a further 30 mins for my pizza to arrive.Finally, it arrived, bringing me on to problem number 2: the pizza, which contrary to my hopes and dreams, was dry and overcooked. Yep, overcooked - quite a rare shortcoming for a pizzeria.Having struggled through the pizza, I finally managed to hail another waiter to ask whether I might be able to order dessert, who said \"of course\" and disappeared. Then another interminable wait for the dessert menu followed. This despite a flurry of waiters flocking past my table to the bar and kitchen and my aiming crescendos of \"Excuse me! ExCUSE me! EXCUSE ME!\" in their direction. Eventually I managed to get someone's attention - the manager, as it turned out. Rather than order a dessert, I asked for the bill. A few minutes later it arrived. Fuming, I took the unusual step of asking that the service charge be removed from the bill. The manager was contrite, agreeing to take off the service charge and asking if there was something wrong: I said the service had taken ages. He thanked me for the \"feedback\" gave and asked if he might be able to give me a complimentary tiramisu as an apology. I accepted, particularly as I'd wanted that in the first place! It arrived fairly swiftly and, price aside, was okay: creamy, fluffy, plenty of chocolate dusting, but not huge amounts of coffee.Overall? I was impressed by the efforts of the manager here make things right, but I didn't get my time back, nor, crucially, do I have any reason to be confident that the service would be better were I to visit again. On top of that, the pizza was sub-standard. So I won't be hurrying back here given the wealth of other restaurants on or around Kings Road. A shame, because I really wanted to like this place.",

Usually, though, I get a smaller pizza - say, a couple feet long, when I'm not with a group who can polish off the six-feet version... and I'm equally happy with it. \u00a0The servers here are friendly, very Italian... although also very *slow*... ask them to bring you olives right away, 'cause if you're not hungry when you first get there... you probably will be before your food arrives.I'm a little conflicted about this place in terms of eco-ethics.... the \"made in Italy\" moniker stems from the fact that they import *everything* in from Italia... even the cheese is flown in twice a week. \u00a0Which is lovely in its faithfulness to homegrown Italian ingredients... but I find the reality of the carbon footprint increasingly hard to swallow.",

I haven't seen this \"pizza by the meter\" concept over in America, but I love it! We got the Capricciosa and the Salsiccia e Pepperoni. The Capricciosa was our favorite -- the sauce, sausage, ham, mushrooms and artichokes provided a nice balance of flavors without being too complicated. We knew the Salsiccia e Pepperoni didn't have sauce but we got it anyways thinking it would still be good; at least we now know we have a preference for pizza with marinara sauce.We also ordered the grilled vegetables as a starter -- the wife didn't like it that the vegetables were cold. I still enjoyed it very much.We had a weird incident where a lady walked by a table and accidentally knocked over someone's wine bottle (in the wine chilling bucket), making a big mess. The lady was quite rude in not really apologizing. Fortunately, the wine bottle was nearly empty but the ice got everywhere. Anyway, this wasn't really the restaurant's fault and they cleaned everything up quickly. All this to say that the tables are spaced quite closely together and you should be careful of rude people carelessly walking by your table and knocking things over on your table.We'll definitely be coming back here and trying some of the other pizzas!",

Staff is very friendly (always smile and polite) and the pasta (linguine seafood comes with a water and a slice of lemon to clean your fingers) was better than an average. Until, one of the staffs brought her dog into the kitchen so that kinda put me off and no one seems to care about it. If you don't mind a lack of hygiene \u00a0from time-to-time and wonder what's going on behind the kitchen, then this could be a good choice for your night out with a couple of friends or dates. (A large family might struggle to find a good table there)",

It is a chain disguised as an independent, and the service can be terrible. We were served horrible wine (completely soar - it was undrinkable). I brought it to the attention of the waitress - she shrugged her shoulders and then said it 'was what we ordered' and wandered off. Not a great experience. They then gave us way too little change from the bill, tried to argue about it, then realised that they were in the wrong and back-peddled. Whoops. It could have been a bad day but I would look elsewhere .",

The food was fresh and of high quality. Reading the other reviews, I do remember the pizzas being wonderful - they're pretty massive and looked loaded with goodies. My friends and I ate on the veranda/roof deck on a beautiful summer day and thought it was cozy as well as a little rustic. Definitely recommend eating on the roof and the restaurant as being good for a date - in fact, I recall seeing a few couples as well as a schoolboy obviously trying to impress a lady. How darling, blowing your pocket money on a girl, and I had to give the teen credit for choosing quite an excellent establishment to blow it on.As students from New York studying abroad, most of London was expensive (courtesy of the shitty dollar and our college budgets), but I recall Made In Italy being quite fair for London. I'd go back in a jiffy, if it wasn't across the Atlantic.And hey, we New Yorkers have some pretty good Italian over here too aye?",

The pasta was flavoursome and the portion generous. \u00a0The pizza base was crispy and chewy at the same time, and the toppings delicious!A lovely evening spent outdoors eating delicious Italian food. \u00a0I couldn't ask for more and would definitely return to try their pizza by the metre.",

Made in Italy is really authentic, in the quality of the food and in particular of its pizza, the service and the pricing.The place has 3.5 floors full of tables and the majority of the waiters are italians. The pizza comes on a wood table and it is measured as 25cm per person and every segment can be made with a different style: my favourite is the Sicilian with aubergines and ricotta salata, but also the rocket and parmesan is very good as well as all the others with buffalo mozzarella. In the menu there are a lot of different styles, both traditionals and a little innovative. Besides the pizzas, there are a lot of traditional Italian dishes in the menu, very good the parmigiana but haven't tried the other stuff. Wine list is quite short, but traditionally I drink beer with pizza (here you have Peroni and Moretti if I remember correctly). Nice dessert menu, most recently I tried the lemon sorbetto and was good. As almost everywhere in London, it is better to book a table especially over the weekend as it can get very crowded and sometimes noisy.",

The atmosphere is low-key and inviting.The bad: The timing of the entrees after the appetizer was poor given we took plenty of time eating the appetizer and then waited another 15 minutes once plates were cleared before getting the entree. While the gnocchi was tasty, the sauce was disappointingly heavy and oily. The chicken/rocket salad was quite uninteresting and I'm positive I could have made something a bit more inspired. The plates from dinner were cleared and it took another 10 minutes to see the dessert menu. Finally it took another 10 min for us to finally wave our debit card in the air. Don't get me wrong, I had some great conversation over dinner, and was happy they didn't rush me out the door, but the devolving service and the quart of cream in the gnocchi really weighed us down in the end. The 46 quid bill was bold enough to include tip.",
