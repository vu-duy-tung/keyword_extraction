The waiter coached us to order several dishes with three differerent degrees of spicyness, from mild to medium to hot. I had the hot signature lamb dish. \u00a0It was pretty fiery but just fine for me. The medium and mild chicken and prawn dishes were loved by the others. We all very much liked the prawn appetizer.I have to say that everyone thought this was the best Indian restaurant they had ever tried. \u00a0Again, the waiter was great. The prices were reasonable.",

    "text": "Pappadam (appetizer) was similar to most other Indian restaurants - maybe worth it if you've acquired a pappadam taste, but I wouldn't get it again.Lamb biryani was exceptional. I wouldn't change a thing with the hotness/spice/flavor (it's a moderately spicy dish). Meen Kullambu (fish in a curry sauce) was pretty good, although I think it could be improved with a bit more curry and coconut flavor. The fish flavor was pretty mild so maybe the chef didn't want to overpower it, but overall it errors slightly too far on the mild side for my liking.Because this place is southern Indian they don't have naan. We had Coconut Rice and Chapati bread on the side. Both were good, although I thought the bread was a little greasy. Staff was friendly and gladly took our picture when we asked & chatted with us.We made a reservation with the web page, never got a confirmation email, but were still on the list & got seated right away.",

The food, however, is what makes this place a standout. My mom and I split a plain dosa, two curry dishes, the prawn and mild lamb. Both were flavorful and rich without being greasy, or overpoweringly spicy. As well as the curry we had the house salad, at first I was skeptical because iceberg lettuce was involved, but the light vinegar dressing, and the sweetness of the mango complemented each other perfectly.The waiter did forget our order of chai, but since he was still in training, I'll cut him some slack.",

Ok but nothing to go out of your way for. \u00a0But, half way through my lamb curry dinner I tilted the rice bowl and got a stream of water all over my food. I thought it was hot water to keep the rice hot. But it turned out to be dishwasher water leaking from a hole in the bowl's lining. They were quick to respond to my complaint (probably happened before). I got a fresh plate of rice but it looked like they just added some gravy to make up for the lamb curry that got washed away. BUT they offered no compensation on the bill, no dessert on the house. And to insult to injury tacked 12.5% tip on the bill (you should never tip the owner who is also the waiter in his own restaurant.) overall unpleasant experience. And what's with the candles in a place lit like up like day time?",

The service was very attentive and they clearly cared about making a good impression, but the food was hit and miss. The big misses were the papadum and chapati, both of which were hard and stiff in places, like they were old or overcooked. They should be soft and pliable. These were dense and heavy. Admittedly these are northern Indian breads. I should have ordered the dosa, which is southern Indian and their specialty. I also ordered the chicken curry which was reportedly mother's special recipe, but the meat was a bit dry and the sauce nothing special. In one amusing incident I ordered a martini, which was on the drink menu. I was brought a shot glass full of vermouth. I questioned this and the waiter brought out a bottle of Martini vermouth and indicated that that is what I ordered. I specified gin and was given gin on the rocks. Should have ordered the beer, obviously. Anyway they did not charge me for the drink and were very nice about the whole incident. My wife had the vegetarian Thali and she enjoyed it, but admitted she had had better.",

The waiter brought me sliced Chili pepper to eat with the meal but that's really not the way Indian cooking is made spicy. Everything was bland, nothing like South Indian food at all. There was no depth to the taste of the food at all. \u00a0I assumed it must be some sort of fusion cooking. They do pack a lot of little dishes in the lunch special(Lamb curry, Channa Dhal) but none really stand out at all. They could probably do better if they served it with pickles or a better Sambal, rather than 2 types of Raitha. The Dhosa was vegetarian, and again very bland.

You can get the vegetarian option for as little as \u00a33.75 and the lamb or chicken option for just \u00a33.95. We got two vegetarian lunches which consisted of bread, rice, an indian yogurth dip, some vegetable fried ball and two curries each. All was really great and they also provided cutlery and napkins. We walked to the closeby Bedford Square and sat on the ground just as everyone else did.This restaurant is a great option for everyone who wants to eat great Indian food, but is looking for an affordable lunch option (but I don't want to say that it was worse or that more expensive indian food would be any better). You can also have lunch in the restaurant for \u00a36.95. The restaurant is very close to Oxford Street and thus perfect for those needing to relax between the shopping madness.",

The food took a while to come and I've made a mental note not to come for lunch again. But the food itself was pretty damn good. There were plenty of spices and half a boiled egg as well.

    "text": "I found out about Chettinad only earlier this summer. That surprised me a bit, since I had thought that I must have tried most of the good Indian restaurants that are there to be tried in central London. But I trusted the yelp reviews went ahead. I have been here twice so far, on both occasions it was for dinner, and the experience has been decidedly mixed. The food is good ... Not exceptional but good. I have tried the chettinad curries, both chicken and lamb, and have enjoyed both of them, especially the lamb. They might have been a bit too spicy for the average British palate, but that was how those dishes were meant to be. A friend tried the chicken dosa, which she found disappointing. For an Indian restaurant, there were surprisingly few vegetarian main courses available. But they did not disappoint. The service occasionally left a lot to be desired. The table for two had only one set of cutlery and napkin. We didn't get a complete second set in spite of asking repeatedly and had to borrow one from the empty adjacent table. The service was also quite slow on my last visit (which was on a Monday evening) in spite of the restaurant not being even half full. We had to wait an inordinately long amount of time before we could get anything, from food to water to the bill. The management could look into this. The decoration on the walls caught my eye. There were some traditional Indian implements and crafts, and from all over India and not merely from the South. The food was not expensive ... About \u00a320 per person for a full meal. I will probably return if I am in the region and had a craving for South Indian food, but might not make the trek from elsewhere.",

We came in around pm and it looks like they had 2 waitstaff and a manager that was running around trying to wait on everyone. The food was great , we had some dosa, lamb curry and seafood curry. I wouldn't recommend the seafood curry as much as it's not authentic as it should be. It was very sweet. Portions are very small for the price that you are paying (even when you are in London). Note to the owners. You have to hire more staff to support your growth. While the food is good , the wait for a table , food , drinks and our bill was extremely frustrating. Enough to stop me from coming again.",

Until now whenever a non-Indian friend in London has asked me where they can get good Indian food in central London, I answer some version of \"an Indian home\"Chettinad as their name suggests, focuses on the food from the Chettinad region of Southern India. It's almost 85% there in authenticity. \u00a0Spices have been subdued from this fiery cuisine, but the complexity of flavours is still present.The staff is very comfortable with their menu and love explaining the subtle differences to non-Indian visitors. From what I could hear at our neighbouring tables, they were quite accurate too. They are very very good with allergies, recommending I avoid the fried fish as it was fried in the same oil as the prawns (which I'm allergic to)The thali is always a great choice in an Indian restaurant, giving you a little bit of everything. We also loved the chicken biryani and the rasam. Let the wait staff know your spice tolerance and protein choices and let them recommend the best combination for you. The food was excellent and I can see us going back here multiple times.",

The location is not too out \u00a0of the way and easy to get to - approximately an 8 minute walk from Oxford Circus tube and 2-minutes away from Tottenham Court Road. Once you get there for lunch, don't think much, just get the Lunch Special Thali. You can opt for the Chicken or Goat thali or just the veggie option. I got the chicken one for \u00a37.75 and it comes with a chicken curry, 2 vegetarian curries, pulao, yogurt raita, masala dosa and chutney. That is a lot of food for one person & everything was delicious! In my thali I got the dry chicken curry in a coconut preparation which was medium spicy. My 2 veg curry dishes were the aubergine in a tomato curry (dry) and a mildly tempered coconut curry with carrots, beans and peas. I loved the coconut curry, it went really well with the pulao and the poppadum was the perfect accompaniment. And none of the oily, slimy dishes that seem to be a staple in some Indian restaurants (especially in our part of the world in NJ).However, the star of this meal was the mini masala dosa - the traditional Indian crepe with a yellow potato flavoring. This was one crisp dosa served right with the coconut chutney. Yes - you must be a real coconut lover to enjoy this meal as there were a lot of mouthwatering coconut-y flavors in the thali; typical of Chettinad cuisine from South India. If I had to nitpick I would comment that the curry dishes in the thali were not hot enough - my guess is that they served the curries and then dished out the dosa, which was nice and crisp. The service was quick and efficient, just like it should be during lunch hours. Also must point out that their lunch special for \u00a37.75 is only till pm and I reached at 3.10 pm and put it in my order. After 3 pm it's or \u00a39.99 but they were still nice enough to charge me or \u00a37.75.I also got the nice strong cup of Indian Madras Coffee which was the perfect way to wrap this tasty lunch.",

    "text": "We tried 3 new Indian restaurants this month and Chettinad is my favorite! Southern Indian with a deep complexity of flavors in our chettinadu kolli ( chicken curry) which linger a long time on the tongue after each bite. The menu says there are 23 different ingredients making up the spices and flavors of this dish. \u00a0(-; \u00a0Reminds me of spicy chocolate. The tomato rice complemented this dish.We enjoyed the masala dosa appetizer as well. It came with 2 tasty sauces. The service was very informative and helpful. The restaurant is pleasant and casual, and is off Tottenham court road, and it's on Percy.",

    "text": "Went looking for good south Indian food and decided to enter this restaurant instead of the one next door. The ambience is better inside,then what it looks from outside.We were a couple and we ordered 1 lemonade,1mini dosa for starter,1 chettinad kolli(chicken in chettinad style), 1 plate paratha, and lastly 1 chicken biryani.Masala Dosa was good. It wasn't crispy but it had good flavour. Coconut chutney and sambhar was truly decious. Reminded me of my days in bangalore.Chettinad kolli was very very good. The spices were perfectly blended and the quantity was good as well.It paired well with paratha(kerala paratha aswe call it).I was not a big fan of biryani. It felt like rice mixed witj chettinad gravy and chicken was little bland.Meal for 2 came upto 35\u00a3. In the menu card it said after 6pm, the amount for the meal should be atleast 15\u00a3 per person, which I thought was weird and strange.Overall good food!",

We ordered the Chettinad Chicken Curry, Poricha Kozhi (Chicken 65), Coconut Rice, and a Mysore Masala Dosa and they were all nothing short of amazing with the Dosa taking away the prize. The service could've been a bit faster although it wasn't particularly slow given the given the size of the crowd they were handling so I'm not taking away stars. Go for this if you need a South Indian feast!",

The chutneys are all on point. And if you have any space left, wash it all down with their mango lassi. Top marks for South Indian food and exceptional service. They don't temper down the spice as they do in quite a lot of Indian restaurants in London and so the food is as authentic Chettinad as it gets.",

    "text": "I arrived to this place just fooling around the city at night and craving Indian Food... after reading some of the reviews I thought that it was hard to get a table but I gave it a try.The place was full as expected on a Saturday night but the owner of the restaurant told me to wait 15 minutes... actually I was surprised for the short time because I saw people waiting, but 15 minutes was not bad after a 3 hour walking.When I've got sit, the service was prompt and very friendly. The girl who attended me was helpful and explained to me some items in the menu like the Dosa (actually, this is one of the things that I really wanted to try because I've read about Dosas in London were so good) and the Thalies. I ate the Onion Rava Dosa and a Thengai Kolli Kullambu, both were great and delicious. I asked the Thengai to be spicy hot... it was good, when i start sweating means good choice...ha ha ha :).If you are walking around Piccadilly Circus... you can walk 20 minutes north and get here. I recommend it. PS. It is not \"open\" network but if you want to connect to their wi-fi, they'll give you the password. Great !!!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0:)",
