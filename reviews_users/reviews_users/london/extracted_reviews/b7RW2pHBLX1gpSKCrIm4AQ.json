Still, this is a great local that manages to feature some sophistication in terms of its offerings whilst still being able to be filled to the gills and dripping with pints for a big football match. The place isn't huge, but it has enough different spaces that you can normally find somewhere to sit (don't forget to check upstairs). They've got a good number of beers on tap and a good selection of bottled beer as well. There's also a full bar, and typically a decent choice of wine too, although the bartenders are assiduous in their use of those (tiny) measuring cups, much to this American drinkers chagrin.Despite the proletarian name, the drinks aren't really cheap, and this place knows what kind of neighborhood it is in. They shut up shop early round these parts so you'll have to hit the high street or better yet the tube by 10:50 - I was even here once for a New Years Eve party and they had the place cleared out by 12:15.",

Staff can be a bit slow and unhelpful when things get busy, especially when their talking to some of the customers, but otherwise it's good. You'll find the usual selection of beer and cider on the tap, plus pub food (and more surprisingly). Prices are reasonable, especially given the area.",

It's conveniently located just off the hustle and bustle of High St. Kensington. Very quick walk from the High St. Ken underground metro stop. The reviews indicated that the food here is top notch gastro pub. I reserved a large table well ahead of time. When we got there our table was all ready for us (even had my name on the table). Although being a Sunday it felt like they hadn't quite recovered from the previous night. \u00a0Our waiter was brand new so wasn't quite familiar with the menu yet but he did a decent job and no orders were missed or dropped. The food was great! I shared a roast chicken with all the trimmings with my daughter and hubbie got the lamb. Others had fish and chips and roast beef. All in all an excellent meal. Can't give a review for night time though as we were there for Sunday lunch.",

Lots of choice on tap, including a couple of ciders. For food, the mains are all quite good, though the appetizer/snacks can be a bit on the skimpy side. The service was a bit slow once when we were in because of some problems with the kitchen, apparently. I saw the bar staff chew out the cook, and at least one customer asked for their money back. I've been three other times, though, and had no problems; in fact, the last time the service was very attentive. You can book a spot to watch their free movies on Sunday nights in an upstairs room. As if you needed another excuse to go to the pub. There are some nice benches outside. It's a great place to people-watch.",

I liked it so much for drinking I figured I'd come back for SUNDAY ROAST. That's when things went downhill fast: they were out of chicken, they were out of sea bass, they could neither confirm nor deny the presence of dairy in the nut loaf for a lactose intolerant friend...Forty-five minutes pass and our friends receive their lunches: fish & chips and roast pork (cold.) It's another 15 until we get ours. Though I've ordered beef the server (who admitted the day had been a disaster) brings me and my dining companion pork and says, \"Sorry we gave away the last beef, here's pork.\" I didn't order pork. I didn't want pork. My consolation prize? Free dessert. Bits of my meal, like our friend's, were also cold. Warm roastie, cold mash...you get the picture.I'd definitely not return to the Builders Arms for food. I might consider it for a drink but not without some hesitation. I had so hoped this homey pub might become my local. As of now, I'm still looking.",

    "text": "I was hoping for good things when I stepped foot into Builders Arms, but was left feeling unwelcome and my wallet quite a bit lighter.It was my last night in London and was staying at one of London Perfect's apartments just down the street. Walking aimlessly looking for a pub or caf\u00e9 to work from, I happened upon Builders Arms. I remember seeing it during a tour of Kensington earlier in the week, so figured I'd give it a try.-Unwelcome-The moment I walked in I felt it felt as though nobody cared of my existence. It wasn't that busy, and all I wanted was a table for myself. Finally, the hostess comes up from chatting with her colleague and welcomes me with a cold hello. I ask her for a table for one, in which she looks around at the empty tables and points to a shelved window area, tucked around the corner next to the kitchen.-Unpleasant Staff-Up until now, my experience with staff at hotels, restaurants, cafes, and pubs in London were more than pleasant. In fact, I'd give them all 5-stars, unlike this review. Every staff member at Builders Arms was sour and unpleasant. It's understandable if 1 or maybe 2 staff have shitty attitudes, because I'm sure working in the service industry has to be rough, but it was as though I shit in their cereal that morning.After my cold greeting from the hostess, who didn't provide me with a menu, I sat and waited for 20-minutes before deciding to take action. Was I wrong in thinking they would come over and ask me if I wanted something? I guess so. Sitting right next to the pub's computer, which had staff member after staff member using it and passing right by me, I ask this bald man with tattoos if I could have a menu. With hesitation and almost disgust on his face, he grabs one from the table and gives it to me. I mention his look, because I'm more than certain he was the manager, perhaps even the owner? Later I heard him swearing and throwing things around in the kitchen. Super friendly dude, no?Finally, a waiter decides to help me after I turn and ask him if I can order. Key phrase: \"I turn and ask him if I can order.\" As if they're doing me a favor.-Upsold Everything and Wrong Orders-I write about lifestyle and travel for a living. So spending a lot of money on food and drinks is pretty normal. However, one thing I look for when dealing with restaurants is how they try to upsell things. It started with the wine. I asked for a bottle of a Spanish red, and without hesitation he upsold me to a wine that I know for a fact is underrated. I let it go, because maybe he really thought it was better choice, but then he upsold me on my meal.A big no-no in my book is when you order a bottle of wine and it gets delivered uncorked. I won't go too much into this, but just know that isn't exactly normal. You should be offered to taste it first, and if you know what you're doing, smell the cork, too. I'm no expert in wine tasting, but I know that much. Another pet peeve is when a wine is \"recommended\" and the incorrect bottle shows up (LOL). Instead of a 2008, a 2010 was there. This left me with many questions.-Food-I'll just leave you with this: The roast was overrated, carrots were under cooked, and the potatoes were over cooked.*For those that lasted this long throughout the post.*Some of you reading this, especially fans of this place, might wonder why I stayed around for all of this and put up with it. When you're reviewing a place, it's best to not make it known you're doing so. Popping into a restaurant or pub is the best way to get the true feel for a place. I don't consider this a wasted trip, and as always, recommend you to try this place out for yourself. Hopefully it's better than what I experienced.",

So when we needed some pre-show grub near the Royal Albert Hall we decided to come here. The downstairs was a bit crowded and loud so we sat upstairs. I ordered a glass of blush wine and we shared two plates - the classic dish of sausages and mash potatoes and a dish of braised pork belly, chorizo and barley. Both plates were tremendous! The sausages were tasty and even the mashed potatoes were better than most I've had. The pork belly was perfectly tender and matched well with the spicy chorizo and the slightly crunchy barley. I'm really curious how they maintained the barley's texture. In any case it was delicious and reasonably prices as well.",
