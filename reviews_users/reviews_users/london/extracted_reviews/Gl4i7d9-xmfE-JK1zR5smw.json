By the time we were finally shown to our table upstairs they were still having a staff meeting! Hmmm.....Anyway, now to the food:They have some nibbles they refer to as \"something while you wait\", we chose two options from here: the Taco Selection and the Cassava&Sweet potato chips. We did not like either.The seafood gyoza was too doughy and undercooked.The Following dishes were nothing special:The Pescaditos ( a selection of fried seafood), the arroz con verduras (fried brown rice with veg).The salmon and mackerel nigiri's were average but were ruined by the truly awful soy sauce. Unfortunately this also ruined the delightful FRESH wasabi. Shame.The dishes that were really delicious: the paperthin veg salad (wow!), the black cod, the tentaculos de pulpo (octopus so tender we were rendered speechless!), the lomo saltado (their own version of the Peruvian national dish in a roll). \u00a0As for dessert, the chocolate fondant was better than the passion fruit brulee, we thought.Some dishes better than others. We shall be trying the other peruvian options in london soon.",

    "text": "After searching high and low for a place to eat last night I was in London, I came across Chotto Matte. Being a massive sushi fan, I felt this would be the place for me and booked ahead. Once I had arrived, I was really impressed with how it all looked. Very modern and, to sound like an old woman, very \"hip\". We were quickly taken to our table and told about how it all works. We were told normally people order 5 dishes but that seemed a little too much for us. We had only really planned to have a bite to each and some cocktails. After sitting for a little bit longer than I usual, our waiter came round to take our food order. He started to walk off just as we gave our drinks order and told us he would come back. After that, we watched as he went round to every table bar us. It almost felt like because we didn't want to order 5 dishes, he didn't seem interested. The food itself was perfect and came out very quickly. Sadly several times we had to ask the other waiters about our drinks order and nothing ever seemed to come from it. Finally when we were on our last dish, we managed to get ahold of our waiter, who didn't apologise for forgetting our drinks or generally seemed bothered by us which was frustrating. Overall, the food was pretty amazing and the vibe inside is great but I was so disappointed with the service we received that night.",

The food looked great but was only ok, if you take into consideration price then the food is very disappointing. Sushi wasn't great. Tuna tatar tasted mainly of corn. Spicy chicken with taro just didn't work. Aubergine was nice. Chips were awful. Cerviche good but had only 3 pieces of fish in it. Quinoa was boring. The grapefruit juice in the bellini only ruined the overall taste of it. The only thing that was good here were the patron peppers and the peruvian beer. The food at Roka is is much better than anything I ate in this restaurant. Come here for the trendy youthful ambiance. Don't come here if you are looking for great food.",

    "text": "Low star review here to alert you to the hap hazard service received. We decided to try the restaurant after we had we tried the bar on a previous occasion. The bar service downstairs was great , we didn't need to leave our standing table during the night and we were looked after. Unfortunately the same could not be said for upstairs. We were offered a table around the chefs cooking area which I normally prefer anyway to add to the dining experience. I would not recommend doing this at Choco though. My eyes were sore and hair stank of smoke by the time we left. The extractor fans for the BBQ meat and fish is clearly not efficient enough to cope with eradicating the smells and smoke. It also didn't help being able to see that the mayonnaise used to dress the dishes was past it's use by date by 5 days. The dishes were good. The cold dishes great but surprisingly the hot dishes, despite being prepared right before my smokey eyes, were being delivered mildly warm. So the lomo steak and monk fish would have been much better had they been delivered hot. Such a shame as they had great flavour. We had the yellowtail sashimi and mixed sashimi that were good. The polpo (octopus) did arrive hot and was also tasty. Another review states that after ordering the food, that was the last of the service. I absolutely agree. The same happened to us. \u00a0We were only able to order one drink and when we tried to order espressos from 4 different waiters we ended up waiting nearly half an hour for it to arrive. When we finally left our table, having asked for the bill 20 minutes earlier also from various different waiters we waited at the hostess point to pay as we were not getting \u00a0anywhere waiting \u00a0at our table to pay. Parts of the bill was wrong (check they don't charge you for iced water) and by this stage we felt we had no option but to rev up the complaints. We very much were the disgruntled customer. The hostess was horrified to find out about our experience and after speaking to the manager she \u00a0removed certain items off the bill such as cold food and service charge of \u00a315.So advice - be aware it might be slow service on the busier nights of London -Friday and don't sit by the chefs table. It is a good venue and it should be tried. I hope that we just had a one off bad experience. Otherwise just stick to the bar downstairs . It plays great music and drinks are excellent.",

    "text": "Having not been a part of the Yelp crowd that attended this location for a birthday party, I decided to come here with my swimming buddy after one of our few swim + dine nights. We tend to pick places we haven't been to and this was one of the places that's been open a while that I've not managed to come to, since my partner would usually balk at the notion of beef hearts and octopus. It's a Tuesday night, and it's apparent the place isn't fully seated yet (we waltz in around 7:30). Thankfully, we're seated at the bar seats upstairs. When you first walk in, you feel like this place should be in NYC, not London. It's somewhat pretentious in decor, although, I couldn't quite place a finger (even now that it's been a few hours after the meal) about what I didn't necessarily like about the decor. I guess it's just that pseudo semi dark atmosphere that isn't done as appropriately and doesn't do the Peruvian portion of the menu justice.Anyway, the food here is actually really good, especially if you're not looking for authentic Japanese or authentic Peruvian. We ordered the Beef Hearts (Corazon), the Octopus (Tentaculous), Courgette with beetroot crisps, and the Sato Maki. All come really well decorated, and finely put together - somewhat. We had the pleasure (pain) of sitting right next to the area which the chefs prepare the sushi. Now, I've seen the folks at Taro Restaurant and a number of different sushi restaurants do it, and there's an adequate amount of care that goes in. It seemed here, not so much. Perhaps they were a little rushed tonight and many more rolls had to be made than usual, in a short space of time. We had the fun show of our own roll being made right in front of us, and when it arrived there was a little bit of theatrics with a blow torch (unnecessary pretentiousness again) but it was good. Could have used a little more wasabi, and a little less salt in the rice, but otherwise, very tasty, and well balanced.The Beef Hearts followed. Now, they were cooked perfectly and have a texture that's somewhat inbetween a fillet of beef and a kidney, and taste somewhat inbetween too. It was definitely very well done and melted in your mouth. The Octopus dish was the same way. I thought it would taste a little like squid, but no, it was tender, well grilled and the spicy aoili and purple potato made it an absolute delight to eat. All in all, this place serves really good food, but it's not a place I'd regularly return to, because it's not my \"style\" of place. It's got a fine dining feel, without the pull to return again. I've now tasted Japanese Peruvian, and I've gotta say, I'm good to go and don't need a revisit. Service wasn't poor for us that night, but I can't say that the atmosphere helps either. It seems like a place (and the clientele on a Tuesday night proved it for me), where corporate soho'ites come to dine because the company is paying for a good meal for a party of 6 or more. Not quite the intimate place that I'd bring a date to.",

    "text": "I think there's a joke to be made involving the phrase \"chotto matte!\" and dismissive service, but I'll let you put that together seeing as I can't be funny all of the time. \u00a0First things first,it looks like they've got their act together pretty quickly as far as service goes.To sum up my experience at CM (thoughts echoed by my dining partner): good food with some great dishes, decent drinks, knows what it wants to be. \u00a0To elaborate on the last point, the interior of CM is pretty cool...low light, glossy black walls, but with spray painted graffiti-esque murals and a UV-lit splatter painting in the basement next to the loos. \u00a0As much as I like the space, it is undoubtedly trendy and we settled on 'effortfully cool'. \u00a0Being food first, I would probably prefer to more quiet and minimalist setting in the same vain as Dinings, but it didn't detract from my experience, nor was it overly loud.The downstairs section is a bar, and there is a pretty extensive cocktail menu. \u00a0I tried a reasonably light cocktail (combination of grapefruit, elderflower and tomato) which was not bad, although it did sound a bit better than it turned out to be (which, to be honest, is mostly to do that, for me, dark spirit cocktails have a higher ceiling for me than light spirit cocktails, but whatever, the drink was still enjoyable). \u00a0 We went for the Nikkei sharing menu II (recently changed from being termed a 'tasting \u00a0menu') consisting of 10 shared dishes and a supplementary plate of Nikkei sashimi - a plate of thinly cut yellowtail with yuzu soy, tomatoes, and jalapenos. \u00a0The yellowtail was a really nice dish, very much a ceviche-style dish with a lot of acidity and garnishing elements, but with the yuzu soy giving it that distinctive Japanese flavour. \u00a0This was definitely a case of resisting the temptation to lick the plate (this was a common theme throughout the evening).Running through:- The first four dishes (IIRC) were i) a selection of tacos with three different fillings (snow crab yuzu/tuna in an interesting tangy sauce/crunchy vegetables); ii) scallops served in a ceviche-esque styly with coriander and jalapenos; iii) ceviche medley; iv) prawn spring roll. \u00a0These were all good dishes - whilst there was no stand-out dish as such, they worked really well together. \u00a0I guess some may find some of the flavours a little samey (the Peruvian influence brings a lot of tang and coriander which was a major part in each of these dishes), but honestly, I couldn't really get enough of it - this dinner definitely seemed to cure my case of scurvy. \u00a0The salsa accompanying the spring rolls was particularly good in this respect and the sauce may have been drunk.- The next two dishes were more mains-y, consisting of black cod and a lamb chop. \u00a0The black cod was very good , the yuzu miso being a nice touch (if you're not a fan of citrus, maybe this menu is not for you). \u00a0The smoky lamb chop provided a nice counterbalance to the cod. \u00a0Again, neither dish was necessarily outstanding, but they were both really well done and nicely complemented each other.- Sushi/sashimi rounded out the savoury section with a plate of maki rolls and a plate of salmon, yellowtail, and tuna sashimi. \u00a0Overall, pretty good quality (as you'd hope), and a nice way to close out the mains.- The two desserts were really good - a chocolate fondant and a passionfruit creme brulee. \u00a0These were probably the most standout individual dishes - A* on the sugar test (I don't have a very sweet tooth), and they worked really nicely as a pairing. \u00a0It was nice having something a bit heavier after a reasonably 'clean' meal.I did wonder before I started, but I left feeling just nicely full. \u00a0All in all, it's pretty decent value at \u00a345 (averaging out at \u00a39 per dish if sharing which does tally given the amount of seafood, and given my recent experiences, it could be all too easy to spend that much at an Izakaya-style place in this country) and the food is of a good standard, especially when taken as a whole. \u00a0It's less fusion-y than I would have expected - the ceviche was very much ceviche and the sushi sushi, but I thought that the overall balance was great. \u00a0As mentioned above, the service was almost faultless, my one criticism being that they could have given us a little more pause between dishes (I know it was Saturday night and all, but I hate hate hate that feeling of being rushed). \u00a0That said, there were no glaring errors, no impoliteness, and the service was generally attentive, so I give them kudos for working hard to correct that. \u00a0Ultimately, it's not the sort of place that would appeal if I walked past (unless I looked at the menu), but looking past the aesthetic, there is some really good food here and I'd quite like to return at some point to try the a la carte. There are plenty of 'cool' (yes, Dr. Evil quotation fingers) which would give much less thought to their food, but I give CM credit for its quality and for being just a little different.",

The bar downstairs is nice, and cocktails were tasty, even the non alcoholic ones! \u00a0I really enjoyed the Matte Elixer, which was coconut cream, orange and carrot juice. \u00a0The food itself was pretty good, I really liked how cumin was mixed into the dishes, had a nice bit of flair to it. \u00a0I love anything acidic, so one of my favorites from the evening was the seafood ceviche. \u00a0There a mix of Peruvian corn in there, with some shrimp, and fish.. The ceviches I have had in the past were never that good, but this was a winner. \u00a0My other favorite was the miso cod, though this is a pretty simple dish. \u00a0The buttery fish just flaked away, cooked perfectly.. delicious! \u00a0The lamb chop was tender, but I preferred it more when I mixed in some of the yuzu salsa (from the prawn spring rolls). \u00a0I don't usually do tasting menus, and maybe this is common, but while I'm OK with sharing dishes.. I wasn't too keen on sharing plates for a tasting menu when the items seem to be so small. \u00a0If its easy enough to divvy up portion sizes for each diner, thats fine. \u00a0The desserts were a bit funny where there were 2 plates of 3 kinds of desserts, plus 1 super tiny slice of something delicious. \u00a0Tasty, yes! A bit funny to share. I would have given this place 3*, mayyyyybe 4* .. but the service was *that* bad that I had to drop it to 2*. \u00a0I can be pretty forgiving if 2, maybe 3 things happened... Grant T summed up a lot of things in his review in regards to the service, so a few specific things that started to add up (yep, its lengthy): \u00a0- we had an 8pm reso (on a Monday night), were told to relax w/ our drinks, but when we asked for the table at 8:30, it wasn't even set up yet. \u00a0After 15 minutes, we asked if the table was ready yet, and we received a very blank \"Yup, its been ready for a while.\" Umm, so why weren't we seated? - we weren't asked if we wanted drinks when we were seated. - there was about a 15-20 minute wait to receive the 2 bottles of wine ordered - food came out a bit too fast (efficient kitchen, I suppose?), and the first 3 plates were piling up. \u00a0Though, we were hoping to enjoy wine with our seafood, and I suppose we did slow our eating down a bit to wait for the wine.. but the wine shouldn't have taken 20 minutes- dishes were inconsistently cleared. \u00a0At the end of the service, we had an assortment of random dishes- there was a 20 minute lull in waiting for our 8th dish (sushi rolls)- almost lost Grant's credit card, had to ask 3-4 times for it. One girl said she'd get it - but didn't even bother asking for his name.. or trying to get the card, so we had to ask someone else. \u00a0Everyone who searched for it had to keep asking for his name. \u00a0During the course of our dinner, they came to us with someone else's credit card too.. don't think the owner of that card would've been too happy that his card was being shopped around.- took another 20 minutes to flag someone down so we could pay - 7 of us went down to get our coats, and understandably the girl told us that our coats and bags are still being retrieved since we had a lot of stuff. \u00a0Half of us were still waiting, so we asked her again, when she realised no one was getting the rest of our stuff- someone from the group politely mentioned that the food was great, but service needed to be brushed up on (and since he's in the food industry, he understands that things can get tough on the service side). \u00a0One of the guys from the bar tutt'd as he went to get our bags, and sloppily held them out saying \".. and who's are these?\". \u00a0You can definitely sense the attitude...In summary, all the food came out really quickly (except for the 20 minute wait for course #8), but in total, we were at the restaurant for about 3.5 hours, just waiting .. and waiting ... and waiting, for things to be done, or rather - not done. We had to repeatedly flag people down request for anything - and you couldn't just ask 1 person, you had to ask a 2nd and 3rd because nothing we asked for firsthand was ever done. \u00a0That was the toughest bit, is that we saw lots of different servers, its just that we didn't have a single server who had ownership of our table, nor bothered to come over and see if we needed anything. Several annoyances were just adding up, and I was *thisfuggingclose* to speaking with the manager (politely) about the poor service, and if they could remove the \u00a350'ish service charge from the bill. Was the food good? - yes, though I wouldn't be able to comment on the value of the a la carte dishes Would I come back again? - to be subject to that type of service again, not a chance!",

    "text": "tldr - Spotty service but more than made up for by incredible food and a fun ambiance! (Great value too)Atmosphere:Bright, nice music, mural adorned walls; just a really fun vibe. We were there from 2030-2230 - it has to be said that the music got notably louder at 2200, such that you almost had to shout. It did however become notably better as well (more housey) so as long as you have a few drinks by 2200 you'll be fine.Food:Almost every dish was stellar. We had the:Aburi Salmon - fresh salmon pieces blow-torched at your table. Cool way to serve it and really tasty.Tostaditas, tuna and hamachi tartar, beef short rib, black cod, and chargrilled chicken and lamb chops - All of these were awesome and worth ordering.chargrilled octopus - the only more average dish but still good.Corn puffs - worth trying. Looks like alien corn; the kernels are massive. Had 2 desserts, the cheesecake and something else. Both good but didn't reach the heights of the other food.Service:2000 reservation and we arrived on the dot. We were told that we had to wait a while for our table. Ended up waiting almost 30 minutes; we didn't actually mind as we were chilling on the single couch near the door and just talking but it's a problem many people seem to have.Our waitress was friendly but not always easy to flag down. They also took ages to bring/refill water.I ordered the sparkling sake and asked if it was sweet (was reasonably sure this was the case as every other sparkling sake I have had is); she said it wasn't and suggested something else. I decided to go with my gut anyway. It was lovely - sweet, light, and exactly what I expected. She should have checked instead of winging it.Others:Toilets are a bit weird - down 2 flights of narrow stairs and just a bit disorienting. Fun to check out though.So reasonable!! Maybe my perspective is skewed but for just the food, and for a lot of food, we paid around \u00a333 each (one friend didn't drink hence we had to calculate the food price).Overall:As long as you aren't starving when you go, and are willing to overlook bad service for amazing food check it out! This is definitely a 5-star restaurant based solely on the food.",

    "text": "This place seems to have appeared out of nowhere - one day it was a Giraffe, the next day its a trendy Japanese/Peruvian restaurant. Unlike many other places in London, the restaurant is huge, and the atmosphere is very nice. I didn't get to try much of the Peruvian dishes, but the sushi rolls were very good - I'd recommend the Aburi, which they torch at the table in front of you. The menu is very elaborate with a lot of choice, and the drinks are very good. Definitely a great place for a romantic dinner.",

    "text": "A cross between Nobu and Sticks n Sushi for Japanese/Peruvian izakaya style dishes. Yes the price is cheaper than Nobu, but I still could not justify it for the small portions, particularly when it's salmon sashimi. No real creativity when it comes to the variety of sashimi and sushi on offer. The miso cod is delicious, but again not justified by the price considering it is the same fish used in run-of-the-mill fish and chips! Lovely venue and atmosphere but I will not be rushing back here.",

Best to skip the rest of this and find his.... kidding... sort of).The really nice thing about this place is that, for the money, the sharing menus are, I think, a pretty good deal. I always worry, particular at seafood-orientated places that tasting menus will leave you feeling hungry. Was not the case here.The ambiance and clientele aren't really my vibe/crowd. 'Effortless cool' is not a phrase I would use to describe it. It is trying really, really hard. But I'm not giving it 4 stars for that. The food was great, totally up my alley, and that's what really matters, no? And unlike other yelpers who went earlier on, we had none of their service issues. If you like lime, yuzu, raw fish, and the like, try it when you feel like a splurge. We left with happy bellies and tangy tongues. A sensible fusion of Japanese and Peruvian flavours and techniques that make a very moreish marriage of styles.",

We order the beef tartare, sushi, lobster ceviche, eggplant and a few other dishes with a reasonably-priced bottle of champagne. Yummy !! I'll Defoe back bc it's such a cool vibe with great food!!",

    "text": "I don't think Chotto Matte is for everyone. I was excited to come here, as I am a huge fan of Japanese food and I like to try new things. I think the problem for me is that I like Japanese food because it brings out the flavour of the actual ingredient, not just the sauce on it. The fusion with Peruvian flavour seemed to me to be about all the sauces and added flavours, most of which were sweet, and I don't really like sweet food. The best item for me was the miso chicken, which was well-made and well-presented. It tasted more like barbecue than miso though and was quite sweet. We also had some kind of vegetable fries, I forget now what kind but perhaps yucca. They were flavourless and after a few I couldn't force myself to finish them even though I was hungry. The salmon sashimi was fine but nothing special. The service here was attentive though and I am sure someone who really likes Peruvian flavours or sweet food would be happy here.",

    "text": "Interesting spot that is targeted toward the a nightlife atmosphere. Awesome space with a nice ambiance. Sadly, service is only good when they are required to serve you. Food is great and even comparable to a similar location in Los Angeles. ServiceFrom the beginning, I thought the service was solid. The wait staff seemed knowledgeable about the menu and reasonable about their recommendations. For the most part they were also attentive and prompt in bringing our drinks and food. BUT, the second our menu completed (we got a tasting menu) then service pretty much ended. No one checked in and it took several attempts to get any wait staff to come to our table. Rather annoying when trying to end the night and get home.FoodOverall good food. If you're willing to spend, then do what we did and grab the Tasting Menu. No one really looked at what was apart of it, but all solid dishes that portioned out well to not be overfilling. I don't remember every dish, but the anticucho dish was nice. Ceviche and gyoza were also excellent. The sushi sampling was also well executed.Overall happy with the place. Of note, the bathroom is a trip with it lit up in the basement. Anyways, I would say try this place out for a nice place for dinner and drinks.",

    "text": "Sooooo, I came here with girlfriends Friday evening for an early dinner. I had never heard of it before so when I looked it up Japanese Peruvian sounded great.I arrived first and I was given the option to be seated or have a drink at the bar. I chose a drink and had a Chotto Bellini, and did some people watching from the bar. The bar and restaurant has a very trendy interior and feels a bit like a night club. Our table was upstairs and we drew a short straw and were right by the main gangway and right by the open kitchen. My first thought was great my hair is going to stink for the rest of the evening and it did!The menu is so hard to choose from. Everything sounded delicious. In the end we decided to get various dishes to share:Canchas to nibble while we waitedTempura prawns, with huacatay and ponzu butterTempura soft shell crab, with yellow chilli and yuzu Black cod, with yellow chilli misoBeef short rib, with asparagus, purple potato and teriyaki sauceAubergine miso, apricots, puffed soba and sesame seedsPork belly, nashi pear, yellow tomato salsaBrown fried rice, vegetables and fragrant soyCassava wedges and smoked panca dipQuinoa salad, pomegranate, coriander and canchasFollowed by:Miso mousse, white chocolate foam, lime and lemongrass sorbetPetit foursGreen teaOur mains and sides were all delicious, especially the black cod and beef. We had told the waiter we'd like to share everything but our food arrived in dribs and drabs and the dishes are quite small so we added a couple of dishes to our order.There are loads of staff, which is quite overwhelming but it's also difficult to get someone's attention. The staff are nice but there is an air of arrogance among them.Dessert was also good, the miso mousse dish is incredibly sweet and is nice to share. The petit fours are tiny and so cute. Another let down was our tea wasn't served with dessert which would have been nice.The loos are interesting as there is on way glass from the gents and a chap came out very concerned we had seen him pee, which was quite amusing. For a busy upmarket establishment it is disappointing when the loos aren't kept clean, a few stalls were not usable and early on in the evening. Come on you have tons of staff, get the, to check the facilities more.I did want to give 4 stars but my niggles out way the delicious food, but it's definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Chotto Matte first came to my attention via the Nudge due to the \u00a335 sushi tasting menu. Seriously, \u00a335 for sushi made by a chef who used to make the stuff for the Emperor of Japan?! Bargain! However, it seems that was an intro special as the tasting menu is now \u00a340 or \u00a345 and is more a Japanese Robata menu rather than pure sushi. That's still a pretty solid deal for Frith St dining and the food turned out to be excellent. Sadly, the dining experience was overshadowed by the largely apathetic (and that's putting it kindly) service we received. And that's enough to make me think twice before ever going back, sadly.The street level of Chotto Matte is a large bar area with plenty of seating and standing room. The bar itself is interesting with a cocktail list with intriguing concoctions and an emphasis on utilising herbs and spices. I tried a toasted cardamom Manhattan which was delicious with the earthy cardamom balancing the smokey whiskey and each sip finished with a hint of sweetness.The menu is a blend of Japanese and Peruvian dishes with several being great examples of well executed fusion cuisine. \u00a0We opted for the \u00a345 tasting menu which included a trio of cold starters, hot mains of miso black cod and grilled lamb chops, a selection of sushi, and an array of desserts.The highlights for me were the seafood ceviche, miso black cod (hard to go wrong with that), and the roast beef maki rolls (bear with me on this). The seafood ceviche is a mix of sweet succulent seafood that melts in your mouth balanced against the crunchy corn and tangy citrus sauce.Next, we had the miso black cod which is usually a winner and here it didn't disappoint. The flaky flesh was perfectly cooked with a light sear on the outside and a moreish miso sauce with just a hint of heat. The roast beef maki rolls were topped with something approximating fine shoestring fries - essentially you have a tender roll contrasted against the crunchy topping. It's worth noting that the term tasting menu is a bit of a misnomer for the menu on offer here. Your dishes for the most part are designed to be shared between two people. The term \"sharing menu\" may be more appropriate to set expectations. The wine list is respectable with our two choices (a Riesling and a drier white) offering a good choice to the party while both pairing well with the food. However, there didn't seem to be a sommelier or knowledgeable waiter around so it was just lucky that our group included an expert bartender. The major let down was the service. It was bad - plain and simple. In all fairness, there were a couple of staff that were good - the lovely girl who cleared our table and offered to hunt down someone so we could order wine and a tall Asian waiter who went above and beyond to track down a credit card misplaced by the bar downstairs - but in general it was slack. It started off poorly as we rocked up about 8pm (when our table was booked) and asked if we should go up or have a drink at the bar. We were reassured there was no rush and to have a drink - great! Then when we wanted to go to the table at 8.30, we were told it would be 10 minutes before it was ready. Essentially, we didn't get to our table until almost 9pm. Our main waiter seemed almost put off by the fact we knew ahead of time we were getting the tasting menu and proceeded to disappear. The food arrived in clumps (3 dishes at a time) so we had barely started into the first course when courses 2 & 3 arrived. It was a good thing they were all cold starters but this was unlike any tasting menu I've had. The general feeling was one of being rushed to wait as there was a long (c15-20 minutes) pause between courses 3 and 4. By this time, we finally managed to get a wine order in and flag someone down for tap water. On a strictly food basis, Chotto Matte is great value for money. However, if the question is would I go back, I'd be torn. Actually no, no I wouldn't - there are just too many excellent places to eat already in London without setting yourself up for more disappointment.",

    "text": "At first sight, I really didn't like this place and would probably never have entered if it weren't for my friends sore feet and the fact that all other places nearby had a wait of about 1-2 hours. So waving goodbye to gorgeous Barrafina across the street, I crossed my fingers, hoped for the best and went in for a table upstairs in the restaurant area - not that the hip and happening music was any lower so expect to yell your way through your conversation.The menu was quite elaborative and a bit confusing with Mexican, Spanish, and French dishes aside from the Japanese, so \u00a0we decided to limit our options and go for tasting menu 1 with a range of fish courses, sushi, pork belly, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (it's world kitchen!), and a bottle of sparkling rose.The first dish came in, and I have to admit it was quite good. Raw salmon fire torched at our table, really yummy and props for special effects. The second dish literally blew my socks off; white fish in absolutely delicious lime sauce, we basically dug in with spoons to eat the sauce. The third dish was perfectly grilled white fish, so gorgeous and crisp with skin on and - a bliss! The fourth dish was pork belly, and at this point I was so stuffed that I decided to wait for the next course; my friend went crazy for these, so I guess it was quite good. The fifth dish was sushi - and that dish would have sufficed in itself, huge portions they serve here! We nibbled and have to admit, good sushi - but there's a catch: they make their own soy sauce and it's just not good enough. We were wondering what the weird taste was until my friend said 'it tastes like hotdog' - and it's absolutely what their soy tastes like, quite funky. Finally, dessert! The passion creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is really good, the ice cream was good, the almond cakes ok. There were some black seeds underneath the ice cream that nearly broke my tooth, but afsides from that a decent ending to a surprisingly good tasting menu. I would probably come back sometime when I'm planning to go clubbing - just down the stairs and you're in bar! What do you know.. I'm really old school and quite fancy the whole slow music-candle light scene too much to trade it in for club dining. But I have to admit, the food was unexpectedly good so props to the chef. Only 3 weeks into their opening, I only hope they stick to their high food quality.",

    "text": "We came here for a friend's birthday dinner. As there were several of us, we staggered in and had some drinks at the bar. I had three cocktails over the course of the night, and one was amazing and the other two were quite good. Anyway, our res was at 8:00, but they told us to relax so we did. When we decided to go to our table at 8:30, we were told it wasn't ready. Really? It's been a half an hour since our reservation time? So we had to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for our table. Which is just strange.When we got to our table, they did bring us some extra nibbles in order to compensate for their ineptness with the table. Which was nice. But really, the table was just the beginning of the problem. We knew in advance, we wanted to get one of the tasting menus, so when they came to our table to bring us the menus, we told them. And they left. No ask about drinks. Just left. The food started arriving. I had to ask for water from someone. We had to flag down someone else to order the wine. And it took ages to show up. By the time it did, they had brought three of our courses. And those courses came way too quickly. Like they just kept coming.But then something weird happened. The courses just stopped. And there were insanely massive breaks between the courses. It was just so disjointed. We had to keep asking for more water. We were basically ignored except to bring food. When we decided to order a few more cocktails at the end of the night, we had to flag down someone. They almost lost my credit card as they require one for a bar tab that they were eventually going to transfer to our table. As you can see, there's a long line of service problems that Chotto Matte seems to have. When we mentioned it to them at the end of the night, they said that they were \"understaffed\" that evening. Which is strange considering I saw at least six different people come to our table that couldn't be bothered to ask us if we wanted anything without our prompting.The food was fairly good. The best dish for me was the beef \"sushi\" rolls. Tasty and the cumin sauce was amazing. The nigiri sushi was kind of average to be honest. Most of the other courses were tasty but not memorable. They brought out a dessert for everyone and we were expected to share. The tasting menu could have been executed better in all honesty. It was as if they just did a full size course and expect it to be split between two people. Meh.The venue itself is one of those restaurants that also wants to be a bar. It's like someone wants to be a chef, but knows that a bar is likely to make more money so they combined the two. It's very disjointed. The toilets are obnoxious and confusing.And with the poor service, I can't imagine that I'd want to go back to give the food another go. They really just need to figure out what they're doing and realize that the service is as important as the food.",

    "text": "We arranged to meet friends here on a friday night, \u00a0our choice had come from a recommendation so we had high hopes. We arrived 10mins before our reservation and were directed to the packed bar to wait for our friends. Eventually we managed to get to the bar that was surrounded by people that already had drinks (personal pet hate of mine) in their defense the bar was already uncomfortably packed so there was no where else to stand. The music was also a couple of decibels louder than it really needed to be. Our friends arrived but it took them an hour to seat us even though we had a reservation, no reasonable excuse was given for our wait but we were told that we would be compensated. Having a vegan in our group we were restricted in our choices but all the food that came out was very good and extremely tasty, it all came out pretty quickly and portions were just enough for four people to get a taste.We finished up at about midnight and requested the bill that arrived without any of the promised discount :-*( fortunately one of our group was an American who had no qualms with pointing out the mistake. To the staffs credit the bill was taken away and returned with \u00a370 taken off. Overall the food and the discount made up for the wait and \u00a0the annoyance of the inappropriately loud music and I would give them another chance.",

    "text": "Japanese and Peruvian Fusion food was much too intriguing not to try out, so not long after it opened, I booked a table and made my way down to Soho to try out the delicacies of Chotto Matte.Right from entering into the place, however, I felt it had a rather pretentious feel about the place. Not a \"This is a seriously classy establishment, and we have the goods to match the trade\", but more of a \"We're going to look hella good, dress up nice and hope the rest follows\". I love a stylish restaurant just as much as the next foodie, but Chotto Matte just felt very.. out of place.That aside, we got seated in a corner (adjacent corners to each other on the table, not opposite - which is always weird), and the menus were bought over. We were recommended to go for the Tasting Menus (which happened to be the most expensive thing on the menu), but wanting to sample it all, we opted for both of the Tasting Menus.The food itself was very delicious, and definitely a lot of new experiences to be had. Though if you're not a fan of fish, this really isn't the place for you! The avocado tempura with smoked purple potato was a delight to have!But the service was.. overbearing. The main waiter came over with each dish (about 14 in total), and followed up each time 30 seconds later asking us how the food is. And the other waiters and waitresses were also keen to pop by and see how the meal was. And I think at some point the manager also came over to ask how everything was. Perhaps they thought I was important people?Whatever it was, it was highly counter-productive to having a conversation with my dinner date. Not really what I'm after when dining in a restaurant.The customary trip to the bathroom was somewhat... confusing, however. The corridors are dark, with low lighting and the Gents and Ladies are clearly distinguished on the doors. Unfortunately, the doors slide automatically, and whenever anyone is nearby... which means you can't see what's printed on the doors. You can probably see where I'm headed, with this..So once you've arrived back at your table and refuse to make contact with anyone who may have seen you almost enter the wrong gendered restroom, the bill was settled, and an experience had been had.One which probably won't be repeated, I'm afraid. Though the food was good, the experience left a sour after-taste.",

It was pretty rammed inside, but whilst I was busy admiring the very cool graffiti style art on the far wall, my team mates managed to find somewhere for us to perch.We took over the spare corner of one of the large communal high tables, and the boys graciously offered the two high stools to us two ladies. We weren't taking up too much room, nor blocking off the walkway to the restaurant area, and yet a highly-strung member of staff complete with earpiece kept ushering our group back against the table. She seemed to have some invisible (and pointless) line in mind and every time someone crossed it she would give an exasperated sigh, ask them to move aside, then return to blocking it herself and scowling. When some of my team attempted to move out of the way to the opposite side of the table she again asked them to move, but seemed to have no problem when a couple of pretty girls wandered in and sat there.I'm not sure what she had shoved up her- ahem, I mean what her problem was, but it felt like she just needed to make herself feel important. Fair enough if there had been reason to the madness but if it was health and safety then the doorman should've stopped letting people in.

A great spot for group dinners with the fully shareable style menu, great background music, intimate lighting and classily edgy artwork and atmosphere.The pace of the food delivery mades it ideal for a long weekend dinner over conversation and drinks. The quinoa salad, teriyaki beef filet, miso chicken and dumplings are all memorable and made to share. It is also well-priced and accepts walk-ins. Definitely one of the best spots in the area for a yummy and fancy - yet reasonable - dinner out.",

    "text": "Chotto Matte is new-ish and rather trendy Latin-Japanese fusion restaurant and lounge. I went on a Tuesday night for dinner and it was bumping. We opted for the \u00a345 tasting menu, which included as election of sushi rolls and grilled items. It was truly a mixture of eclectic flavours which I guess is what happens when you mix Peruvian with Japanese cuisine. Most of the flavour combinations worked, especially the Ceviches...great mixture of fresh fish with the unusual twist of large dried corn kernals. The lomo saltado roll though was a bit weird....surely combining two favourite dishes---lomo saltado (stir fry beef with chips) and sushi would work....but alas the sauce seemed a bit weird with the rice and seaweed roll. The accompanying cocktail list was extensive and there were quite a few drinks I wanted to try. I especially liked the spherical giant ice cube in my Yamazaki Highball.Price wise, Chotto Matte isn't cheap, but not outlandish considering the amount of food you get esp on the tasting menu. All in Chotto Matte is a nice fun addition to the Soho scene. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.",

    "text": "The dishes at Chotto Matte are all small tapas portion which are made for sharing. We ordered various of dishes to share from the different section of the menu - sushi, barbecue, saut\u00e9 and tempura.We started off with the Seabass ceviche which consisted of seabass sashimi, sweet potato, Peruvian corn, coriander, chive oil and citrus sauce. This was one of my favourite dish which had a refreshing flavour and was a good appetizer to start a meal.Another refreshing and tangy dish we tried were the tuna and yellowtail served with onion, ginger, shiso, tomatoes, blackberry salsa. I would had liked some tortilla to accompany this dish as this would goes nice to scoop all the salsa.We tried two of the sushi dishes that are flamed at the table. Sato maki comes with a combination of seabass, salmon and romano pepper with lime soy. The Aburi, comes with four different nigiri: Tuna yuzu, aubergine miso, turbot and salmon. Many of us felt this could have been flamed a bit longer to give it a seared texture. We also ordered some dishes from the barbecue section, including The Lomo a la parrilla was sliced beef fillet served with spicy teriyaki and pomegranate salsa. I found this dish was not worth the price tag of \u00a320.29 as it was only a few slices of beef and I would probably not re-order if I revisit. However, one barbecue dish that did impress me on the table was the Barriguita de chanchito, which was pork belly. We thought the texture and the flavour made this dish a winner for most of us. Chotto Matte is a great place for a cocktail because you will be spoilt with choice as there are a large range of cocktail on their menu. I tried the Flor de Manzana from their anti-depressant cocktail which is described as cocktail with personality. It combined Finlandia Mango vodka, Akashi Tai sake, passionfruit, Bottlegreen elderflower, lime and apple.A meal is usually never complete with out dessert but I could have pass on the dessert at Chotto Matte. The service at Chotto Matte was slow, for both back and front of house. Also, we found that the waiter had added four bottles of water with out us knowing. We did order a bottle of still water to start the evening and the waiter poured it for us during our meal. But it would had been courtesy for the waiter to have asked if we wanted another bottle of water each time it was finished. We could have then decided on having tap water for those who wanted it or none at all because our cocktails had arrived.I would consider Chotto Matte as an expensive place to have dinner, since between 8 people it cost us around \u00a350 per person (including service charge). It would only be a place I would come for just a cocktail or light bites. If it is for dinner then I would wait to visit Chotto Matte for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with two friends and we ordered the Nikkei Tasting Menu 3.The starter courses were good, with the Truffle Sea Bass Ceviche being my favourite. The mains comprised of lamb cutlets and miso cod, both of which were good. However, the miso cod was slightly too fishy and so not as good as the one served at Nobu and Zuma. The sushi course was a major disappointment as the fish was room temperature warm, and definitely needed to be colder. This took a while to arrive so I think maybe the sushi was left out to sit for too long. Lastly, dessert.. Heavenly! They brought us three different kinds to share, which is lovely for a tasting menu. Each was amazing, loved the mochi flavours. Everyone does chocolate fondant, but the one here was mind blowing with perfect chocolate. And the popcorn banana parfait... A great surprise. I gobbled up the dessert. Service could perhaps be improved, as the first few courses arrived in very quick succession, too fast. And then some later courses took way too long. With a bit of improvement though, this could my new favourite modern Japanese restaurant in London",

    "text": "I took advantage of their great pre-theatre menu which includes miso soup, a bento box of goodies and a glass of prosecco for just \u00a325. We started with the miso soup which was warm and not overly salty like it can sometimes be. The bento box was huge with two layers to it and crammed with goodies. There was no clear order in which to eat it so I kinda just went for a try a little bit of everything to find out what was my favourite and the polish off the good stuff.The Padron peppers were something I'd never had before and was surprised by how mild they were, although I read that one in fifty peppers is much, much hotter than the others so I'm very glad I didn't get one of those! The lobster tempura was really great, big chunks of lobster meat in a light and crispy batter and not at all greasy.I absolutely adored the ceviche that I ate at Rex and Mariano a couple of weeks ago and was excited to try more but the sea bass offering here wasn't anywhere near as good and the marinade was far too overpowering in my opinion. The Nikkei sashimi salad was nice too but I do think the presentation of these two dishes was better than the actual taste which is always disappointing.I love sushi so the \u00a0spicy tuna sushi rolls and mixed nigiri were always going to go down a treat and this was a very good selection. Tuna and salmon are familiar toppings to nigiri to me but I'd never had a sea bass one before and thoroughly enjoyed it. Luckily the tuna rolls weren't actually that spicy in my opinion which made them all the better!The final compartment was definitely my favourite though with grilled octopus anticucho, BBQ miso chicken, steamed rice and vegetables with chili & garlic. I've never had octopus grilled before and I don't really like it when my food has suckers but this was cooked to perfection any my absolute favourite dish of the night. The BBQ chicken was really nice and wonderful dipped in some soy sauce but I scrapped a lot of the white sauce that was smeared over it off as I thought there was just a little too much of it.I wasn't stuffed by the end of the meal but I was definitely satiated and there was actually quite a lot of food for \u00a325. You'd spend a lot more than that buying individual dishes anyway and it's nice to get to try selection of things.",

The food was really unspectacular, portions were minuscule and considering some of the dishes are priced the same as Michelin starred restaurants, you would think they'd deliver on flavour. But no, most of the dishes were overpowered with the salty/citrusy taste of yuzu, and had no depth to them. The only redeemable factor apart from the decor & good service was the sharing dessert platter we ordered which was actually really tasty. Won't be going back and won't be recommending.",

The only other time I had Japanese-Peruvian fusion was Nobu (which I get is not a fair comparison) but that said, I'd opt for a normal Japanese restaurant over this. Nothing was horribly wrong but there were a few things that could have gone better. Shrimp tempura was more battered shrimp with no panko and oddly served with a mint sauce (huh?). This was just bizarre. And teriyaki chicken was served with rice but with a big drizzle of some lime vinaigrette. Again, bizarre and not very nice. The mango ice cream mochi ball was my favourite thing.",

After the 3rd course we were done but still had 6 more to go.

There was not much creativity on the texture play.If someone would invite me here again I will come, but will stick to one dish and avoid \u00a370 per person tag, as it's just not done up to my standards.We ended up paying \u00a3250 for two of us including sake",

After everyone had arrived, we decided to order one of the pre-fixed menus that were available. I believe it was about 60 pounds per person, which I find is more on the expensive side. The food was pretty good for what it was, but not amazing from what I remember. Everyone else in the restaurant, who I assumed were locals from the area seemed so bougie and upscale, so I felt slightly underdressed at the time. My dinner experience as a whole here was a nice one, but I probably wouldn't come back as for the price didn't justify the food in my opinion.",

I can't fault the chefs.. kudos. The service however was a disaster! Right from the pretentious hostess to the servers, which made the entire evening including the food unpalatable. Yours is a service industry please do not forget that. You were rude and obnoxious and did not deserve the tip that was included in my bill.",

    "text": "Very trendy and popular eatery in Soho Cotto Matte is more about style over substance. Walking in on a Friday night the restaurant was buzzing, the bar a choice hangout for cocktails. From the clientele to the very styled mood lighting and slick modern decor it felt almost a bit more South Beach than Soho. Then I was hit with a bit of attitude from the hostess at the reception. Completely unnecessary as we had a booking, but none the less this was the greeting. Then I had to deal with a 5 minute queue to check my coat in like I was at a club, all this before I had even had my first cocktial. Add to that snooty clientele in designer fakes who were just being generally rude and obnoxious and it just didn't feel like the best place to be.Soldiering on, having finally checked my coat I then went back to the hostess desk who told me to go upstairs to check in with the next hostess.. and finally I was seated. The waitstaff was pretty good, and thankfully no attitude there, though they did forget a couple of drink orders -twice- \u00a0and the last dish on our order took ages to appear, but it was Friday night and quite busy. Since we shared all dishes within our group, the waitstaff did time and space out delivery of the several dishes we ordered properly, though there was not much room on our table even that way. Seating is quite tight. The Japanese-Peruvian infusion cuisine was more Asian inspired than Peruvian, but what was good, was tasty, while other dishes were just so-so. The challenge is that it is very hit or miss to find what was good. The sushi rolls were probably the best choices on the menu, the ceviches were ok (you can find better next door at Ceviche), so really the best of the menu would be the Japanese dishes. Overall I was left a bit cold by my experience but it did not completely dislike it either. Some of the food was very enjoyable and thankfully the night did get better. I would consider trying it at another time perhaps not on a weekend. But if you like being part of the trendy party scene then go on the weekend as this place is perfect for those types on the way to a big night out or having loud group gatherings after the workweek. For me it was all just a bit... meh.",

I had some of the nigiri sushi with various dressings. \u00a0The flavor was good - sushi itself was just ok. \u00a0Service was good, though a little spotty. \u00a0 If you're in the SoHo area, I'd definitely recommend.",

Reminded us we only had two hours several times - again - the place was empty. Server was rude - food came out randomly. For example - rice came out first - by itself. Manager then gave us a lecture on how the Japanese do it. Long story short - this place try's way to hard to be high end. There's nothing high end about it. They need to chill out!

    "text": "This restaurant changed my life. The whole ethos of the restaurant's sharing concept was beautifully explained to us by our waiter who equated sharing food or sharing a meal as an expression of love. Overall, the food was beautifully presented and a flavour to match. The Japanese and Peruvian flavours blended together perfectly. There were Japanese ingredients and dishes with Latin American spices and colours. The Seabass Ceviche was a beautiful blend of how both cultures prepared raw fish. The Scallop Tiradito, a delicious take on scallop sashimi- pairing it with a tangy Latin flavours of citrus \u00a0and sliced jalape\u00f1os for spice. For the main, the Tentaculos De Pulpo, the sweetness of the Japanese purple potato complemented the spiciness of the octopus. Fusion food is rarely done right, and this is hands down one of the few. My only regret is that I did not try everything.",
