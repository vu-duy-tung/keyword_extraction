    "text": "I haven't met a steakhouse in London that's as good as the Hawksmoor. This location is just as good as the Seven Dials location, and possibly better as it feels like you're high up (in reality only one floor up from the ground floor) compared to in a windowless dungeon somewhere.The steak... wow. Our medium rare chateaubriand was unbelievable. Melt in your mouth tender, perfectly seasoned, and bathed in peppercorn sauce. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it again... throw in some greens (broccoli and cream spinach) and a potato dish - I wish I could remember what it was called - something like \"Jonsson's Temptation\", which was potatoes, cheese and anchovies made for an incredible (and very filling) meal. To top it off we shared a sticky toffee pudding, which I still believe is the best in London.It won't be a cheap evening, in fact, it'll probably be one of your more expensive dinners in London. But if there's a special occasion, and you need a steak, look no further than the Hawksmoor.",

This was probably the nicest restaurant (ambiance-wise) that we went to, but by no means the most expensive. We both ordered the roast, which came with a large serving of beautifully cooked meat, roasted potatoes, Yorkshire pudding (so good!), carrots, greens and bone marrow & onion gravy for \u00a320 each. I had a delicious cocktail (the Grapefruit Picador) and we shared the macaroni and cheese, which was some damn good mac 'n' cheese. We didn't have any complaints about the service, and the restaurant was large and comfortable. Nice bonus: It's just around the corner from Piccadilly Circus tube station.",

Each venue specializes in different fares, so one would be steak, another fish etc... I'm not sure which Air street is, but they had a brilliant selection of meals to choose from, and the decor is lovely. The wine list is extensive and well priced, so expect to wander out well fed and a little wobbly on your feet!",

A cocktail will help me over my disappointment about myself. The menu is extensive and we tried many different ones and they were all delicious. this hidden Art Deco cave is the right place to drink away a gloomy Saturday afternoon.the restaurant is much brighter as it has nearly every surface covered in stylish mirror tiles.

Because - How do you describe your soul mate?I'll explain.We started to go to Hawksmoor Air Street when we couldn't get into the Covent Garden branch. So, yes, this started out as poor planning. But I like to think of it as destiny.The interior feels like an episode of Poirot and has loads of space and (perhaps to the detriment of the management) you really could sit there all night. Since I like to think that I'm as artsy and sophisticated as an episode of Poirot this works quite well for me.Then we move on to the bevies. I had to take a moment to look fondly/wistfully into the sky as I typed this. The bevies are uh-mazing. They're original enough so that you won't find another quite like the one you're having anywhere else if you choose from the cocktail menu but if you go off the menu they're very adept - I had a great rendition of an aviation.I'll move on to the soul mate part. We had already had a visit from the manager thanking us for coming (!), we had indulged in gorgeous starters, and I was tucking into a lovely morsel of filet when my husband said, \"You're singing.\"And I was. See, they were playing the Artic Monkeys and without thinking about it, I was singing along.So, I get a great cocktail and heaven-sent steak AND I get to listen to one of my favourite bands of all time while I enjoy this?Soul mate.",

I was only one who hadn't been here before and the leader of our pack, a steak aficionado and wine connoisseur did all the ordering. A kilo each of porterhouse, t-bone and bone in prime rib later we were more than convinced we had enough meat. Starters of crab on toast, potted beef (easily the best) and grilled bone marrow kept us going till the meat arrived and boy were we spoilt! Bone marrow sauce was a new find for me and I must say peppercorn, mushroom and blue cheese better watch out! Wine selection was very very good and so were the deserts that followed. Deserts were interesting twists on traditional fare like stick toffee pudding and cheesecake but they didn't do anything to take attention away from the star of the nigh which was the beef we chomped down! As if we hadn't done enough there was a bit of Cognac that went around and for a bit of left field choice for a pallet cleanser it went down very well. Staff were always very friendly and attentive and kept things very casual in what can easily be modeled as a fine dining establishment with waiters wearing tailcoats and bow ties, the faded jeans and t-shirts helped to a certain extent in keep our evening casual and relaxed!",

I had the bacon and meat pot with Yorkshire puddings for starter, and it was delicious. Meaty and perfect flavour. It was so huge however, who two giant Yorkers, that it would have been better to share. For main, I went with the 300g rump, medium and it was perfect. Probably the best rump I've ever had. Flavourful tender beef, perfectly medium. But the killer was the bearnaise, which was just the best I've ever had. I had some left after finishing the steak and ate it with a spoon. For wide I had the lettuce and herb salad, which was also a huge portion, and perfect for the beef. I was going to have chips but after the starter l knew I would explode so had the salad and it was dressed with an amazing dressing. I couldn't decide on dessert, as was basically stuffed, \u00a0but went with the shortbread peanut butter cake as I do have a huge sweet tooth, and it was also delicious. Simply delicious.Oh, and service was just perfect. Super friendly and just efficient and happy.I don't eat steak often as I'm virtually a vegetarian and it's REAllY hard to get good meat when eating out (that's why I don't), but this was just awesome.",

It's long, and low ceilinged, but manages to be both clubby, and personal at the same time. A very british version of an american steakhouse.The fish here is as amazing as the steak, and if you're eating a duex I'd really recommend having one of each so you can share.

It was a garlicky, buttery, parsley goodness. My friend ordered the potted beef and bacon which was basically two massive Yorkshire puddings with warm potted beef and caramelised onions. It was tasty but that's all I could say about it. There was not really any uniqueness about the starter dish. I also decided to start of with a Kir Royale which ended up being far more expensive than it should've been in my personal opinion. But man o man, I do love a Kir Royale!We asked what was recommended and the waitress suggested the 'd-rump steak' as it had many flavours and good texture. All of us ordered it on the table, and we were not disappointed. This piece of meat was so juicy, so wonderfully cooked and utterly moorish. Side dishes did not come with the steak so we ordered chips and buttered Hispi cabbage (which for something so bland as a cabbage, was so tasty).Anyway, this piece of steak was bigger than my face, but I ate it slowly as the atmosphere of the restaurant does not make you feel rushed whatsoever. They have a gorgeous wine list which I didn't have the pleasure to experience but next time, I most certainly will. Finally for pudding, I had the peanut butter shortbread which was like nectar to insects. It was salty, it was sweet, it was cold, it was warm. Perfect. My palette was doing cartwheels. All in all, the end result was higher than I expected. The servers were very easy going, helpful and left us to eat without any interruptions (which I prefer). Yes, the price isn't cheap but it's definitely affordable if you want something special.",

Our total bill came to just under \u00a390 and included three courses, a glass of prosecco each and service charge",

I told the restaurant about the occasion and as soon as we walked in, the person at the front desk said happy birthday to my nephew. They sent him a complimentary milkshake which made the young man really happy. They wrote \"Happy Birthday\" on his dessert plate and put a candle on it. The food was very good. I had the Rib-eye, because I always favor well marbled meat. However, when the steak came, it looked slightly burned on the outside, and it wasn't as juicy as I would like it to be, but it was a very good steak. I have to mention the dessert we shared, because it was super delicious! The honeycomb cheese cake was not your usual NY style cheese cake. It was a decomposed dessert: the rich and creamy cheese mousse was on the outside and the cookie crumble was top. I saw a lot of people enjoying their Sunday Roast which was a huge pile of food for only 19 pound.",

From the drinks, appetizers, to the actual main courses, to the desserts!! The service was impeccable as well. I honestly think my meal here was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. What I ordered was a pimms cup, the fried queenies, the smoked salmon appetizer. All so so good. Only wish they would have given more of the little bread pieces with the salmon. Entree was the Sunday roast. Out of this world. My partner ordered some kind of white fish with a side of fries and holy moly his food was amazing as well! The ketchup served with the fries is so good! His fish was excellent! After dinner drink of Irish whisky was fantastic and the fricking desserts!!! It was our anniversary so they gave us complimentary little chocolate caramels. We also orders the peanut butter shortbread dessert as well as the sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream ice cream. The shortbread dessert was good, but the sticky toffee pudding was the best I have EVER had in my life. I dream about it. I dream about this entire meal!!",

    "text": "This place has it all! Amazing food, alcohol and staff! I read a few amazing reviews on this place and decided to try it... You know, when you read reviews in advance... You almost always set yourself up for disaster... In this case it was the complete opposite! I completely agree with all the 5* reviews. Restaurant was almost full when we were seated... So take that into account when reading my review - they did amazing! We started with two cute cocktail drinks (Marmalade cocktail and the Corpse Reviver). I personally like orange-ish-lemony with a lot of tang... So the Marmalade cocktail fit me perfectly! Next our appetizers... My friend ordered the Half Dartmouth Lobster and I ordered the Roast Scallops. The lobster was incredible! (as we're my Scallops)... But my oh my... Amazing! Cooked just right, and melt in your mouth. Dinner... Starting off with wine (a Shiraz and Malbec) we ordered the 300g Filet, and my friend ordered the 400 Rib-eye. Do I even need to say it.. Cooked to perfection! We ordered medium rare, and that was exactly what we got. So much flavor in every bite. The sides we ordered were buttered greens, chips (so good!!), mashed potatoes, and bone marrow... Oh! And macaroni and cheese (not the best, but good as a side in moderation). The only downside of my dinner was I ordered the wrong sauce to go with my filet... I ordered the bearnaise sauce (as recommended by the waitress) and was not impressed... It sort of tasted like a mix of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce (and is super thick, like chunky...) . Luckily my girlfriend had ordered the peppercorn (better than bearnaise) but tasted like watered down gravy and not peppery. Next! Dessert!! My favorite :)I got a little too excited and ordered the Lemon Meringue (I thought it said lemon meringue pie Lol so I was a little bit disappointed when my dessert came) but it still tasted good (not great). My girlfriend ordered the sticky toffee pudding.. It was a bit too sweet for me but had good texture. We also got the chocolate / caramel tart pastry (way too sweet for me as well). The ice cream (salted toffee or caramel or something was amazing though!!!) Overall, great experience. Our server was amazing and attentive. Drinks and food were wonderful. Keep doing what you're doing Hawksmoor!",

Instantly I felt like I was in an establishment that was, \u00a0if not exclusive, respectful of the people who knew of it and chose to walk through the doors.I found my group and sat as the waiter brought their drinks. We had already decided we were here for a particular cocktail, so I ordered it and a coffee too. The coffee came first- nice flavour, not scorched and a good drinking temperature. (black Americano)The cocktail came next. It was why we there: the full fat butter-infused bourbon old fashioned. Oh. My. That first sip is a thing of beauty. Buttery caramel tones with bourbon based warmth over ice. It is not a complex flavour. It doesn't need breaking down any further in my book. It's the kind of thing you take a sip of and say 'ohmigod'... Just yum.Our (rather attractive) waiter brought over a small plate with the salted caramel rolos they make there; which I was excited about as I'd heard about them whilest reader reviews from other yelpers. Again; yum!We only stayed for two rounds as we were going to to other things, but I will definitely be back to further explore the cocktails and sample the food. The service was great, the knowledge of the staff thorough, and the place itself is beautiful and full of art deco details.It would make a great date too, for those wondering!",

    "text": "I have to say it would be pretty hard to put on a better show than Hawksmoor Air St pulled off last night. Thanks to the gracious Linzi M, I met up with 5 fellow Yelpers to partake in a meat feast of legen-wait for it. Well luckily you won't have to wait too long because I've decided to rewrite this as a summary (the fully review is just over 6 pages otherwise...).HawkAir is located, as one might expect, on Air Street. But be warned, it's not the bit of Air St that Google Maps will show you, no it turns out Air St continues on across Regent St for a few feet. That being said, I located the place based on the mouth watering smell of seared steak so it's not that hard to find.Upon entry, a gracious hostess or two will take your name and yet another lovely lady materialised to lighten the burden of jackets and bags our group had accumulated. As we were 1.5 hours early, we climbed up to the bar to settle in and have a drink. Oh the drinks! I'd been dreaming about some of the new additions to the menu and in particular the full-fat old fashioned. Now the name may need a bit of work but the drink certainly doesn't. It's an Old Fashioned built on a butter-infused bourbon that's blended in house. It smells like fresh buttered popcorn and goes down an absolute treat. It's so good that you can ignore the image of your arteries clogging up while you enjoy each decadent buttery smooth sip. My follow ups of a Stolen Heart (made with two alcohols that have had run ins with the law) and a Bottle of Manhattan were just as delicious - my compliments to the bartender!Right, what do you do when you want to try several starters on the menu and you've shown up with a bunch of foodies. Yep, that's right, you order it all. And that's more or less what we did. I could describe each in detail but the highlights were the Potted Beef & Bacon with Yorkshires (packed fully of dense meaty flavour), the belly ribs (with the most tender meat and tastiest sauce I've ever had on ribs), and the pear and blue cheese salad (sweet crunchy pear + sharp blue cheese = awesome).Okay, I've dithered enough - it's time to talk steak. As a disclaimer, I will say that I rarely enjoy a steak at a fine dining place. I tend to believe that I'd rather spend the money on a quality piece of meat which I can grill myself. But I'll tip my hat to Hawksmoor, they do know how to handle their meat. My T-bone was lightly seasoned with pepper and more heavily with salt to give it that perfect crust. Despite it being over an inch thick and larger than my head around, it was almost uniformly medium rare (the edges were more medium but I'll forgive them that slight transgression). The flavour of the beef came through in spades and I was glad to have opted for the waitress's recommendation of medium rare as opposed to my standard rare or blue. I dove straight into the steak, pausing only occasionally to snap up a chip (the triple cooked chips rival Heston's! Get them even if it's the only side you do!) for a bit of variety. At first I was a bit concerned I wouldn't' be able to finish but each succulent bite pushed me a little higher into meat heaven. The juices spilled over my teeth and down my gullet and left me craving even more carnivorous joy. Peter S had graciously offered to help me finish it but after 10 minutes I was chewing the bone clean having powered through almost a kilo of meat. It's that good.For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding remains one fo the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The peanut butter shortbread is rich and buttery and explodes with the taste of fresh crushed peanuts. Special mention should also be made of the Jaffa Cake which is an intense chocolate cake with an orange gel centre. Uber tasty - thanks for the recommendation Tristan J!Finally, I'd just like to say a special thank you to our waitress who dealt with our many questions and requests with a smile and a bit of banter. No matter what, she was always happy to help and well deserving of a generous tip and our thanks.",

    "text": "I visited last night (Friday) with my sister, her husband and my boyfriend for my sister's 30th. I had been really looking forward to it as I am a serious foodie, had heard great things about Hawksmoor and it's my sister's favourite restaurant. The restaurant itself is nice - cool art deco - and we enjoyed drinks in the bar. I don't drink much alcohol so having seedlip as an option was a nice touch. However, I tried my family's cocktails and they were nowhere near as good as the likes of Hakkasan, despite being in the same price range.The food was all fairly nice, but utterly lacked the wow factor I was expecting. The real disappointment though was that the waiters mixed up mine and my partners fillet steaks - me ending up with a bland medium and him my rare, which he probably disliked as much as I did mine. At the beginning of the meal I swapped some of mine for my sisters chateaubriand and commented that hers seemed more rare than mine but she reassured me that it was just that the fillet was not quite as tender and I was reluctant to make a fuss and complain. It was only towards the end when I noticed my partners steak that he had left looked more red that I realised the mix up. I did mention it then (for these prices that's not a mistake they should make) to simply be told by the waitress that she was sorry and have her walk off! She came back some time later and started clearing, saying no more about it. Later someone did come over and offer to take the two fillets off the bill - a good gesture, but the damage was done and I really struggled to hide my disappointment! The service generally was poor too - the waitress was inattentive, did not tidy our table between starter and main, we lacked water at times and her manner simply wasn't particularly professional. The waiters looked quite sloppy too - again, not what I'd expect. As I mentioned, even without these big issues, the food generally was not exceptional. The sides for the steak, of which we had many, lacked much flavour. The lobster was good and the rare steak was pretty nice, desserts were okay, but it didn't have that something extra to justify the high prices. In fact, the only wow for me was a salted caramel rolo I tried which came as a four with a candle for my sister's birthday. Having eaten in some truly exceptional restaurants, I was expecting so much more. For anyone wondering about going here I would say don't bother - seek out a good Michelin restaurant as it'll be the same price and infinitely better food. It's not even that Hawksmoor's food was 'safe', it simply wasn't that good! It's interesting that other reviewers have said standards are slipping here - I suspect that is the problem and now it's riding on its reputation.",

    "text": "It's absolutely style over substance. For a steak restaurant to be this bad at cooking steak is a crime. And what's worse is that people walk anyway believing that's how steak should be cooked. Back when I was a young man growing up in New Zealand we used to grill up huge numbers of rump steak on the BBQ. About two hours after dinner and several bottles of wine later, we'd start to dig into any left over steak, which by this time had become chewing, cold and sweaty. And this is pretty much what we could served at Hawksmoor. Nice dining room though and the bar is a good spot for a drink. Save your money and try Flat Iron instead. Better steak at a fraction of the price.",

I've visited all the other Hawksmoors but this is my favourite because of the fantastic selection of seafood and it's slightly lighter due to it being above ground. An expensive feast, but worth every single penny. The porterhouse was obviously fantastic but even the sides were comparably brilliant (creamed spinach, beef dripping chips and monstrously large onion rings). Best hospitality, best cocktails, best food in London. Drooling just thinking about it.",

Everything from the stained glass art deco windows to the comfty tub seats, wood, and mirrors. It's a Gatsby girl's dream.Oh, and the food! I have to say I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have fresh oysters. I had looked on another of their menus (South Ken I believe) which had about six different types and Air Street only had fried (sigh). I should have checked the menu! Either way, the ambiance made up for lack of the half shelled lovelies.I got the steak tartare and my husband got scallops (why do they still put the coral bit on scallops we wonder? It's not tasty). My Tartare should have been called 'spicy' tartare as anyone with a low spice threshold may be caught unaware. But I LOVE spice so it was a welcome treat. It also was a generous portion.I had to go lobster for my main.... 800g of it. WHY NOT? As I dived into my lobster with no inhibition, by husband feasted on a 500g bone-in sirloin steak (a lot like a New York Strip). He didn't even get any of the mouth watering sauces or butters because the steak was that good. As an American, I'm a little sad they don't prepare the prime rib like they do in the states - so we didn't order it. The anchovy dauphinois (Jansson's temptation) was rich and wonderful.YES we made space for dessert. My husband went liquid pudding and got an amazing perfectly sized Irish Coffee. I got the sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream which again...heaven. I should not have paired it with port though (way to much date/prune undertones, next time I will also get a coffee!!). To top it off, it was my husband's birthday and they brought out their signature 'rolos' with a candle at the end which was just the icing on the birthday dinner.Perfect for a date, birthday or cocktails. Really, anything fun!",

    "text": "I have done Breakfast, Sunday lunch and now finally Steak at Hawksmoor. It was one of the last 'famous' steak restaurants to tick off my list and was going up against some of my favourites such as Goodman, Gaucho and Mash...The layout is fantastic, and you feel like you have really escaped the madness of Piccadilly Circus just below you. I love going with a big table as it gives you the chance to try a bit of everything. I kicked things off with the Scallop starter, which was really good-Better than expected, full of flavour and served in their shells which was a nice touch. I also managed to grab a taste of the Pork belly starter and the Yorkshire pudding starter. The Belly was amazing, and will probably on par with the Scallops. The Yorkshire pudding, was just that really...nice, but you can do better on this menu!The main event was always going to be the fillet for me, and at 300g as standard it's a great size. This is what I base a lot of my rating for a steak restaurant on, as that's what I'm here for. It was great, but it wasn't as good as Goodman's or Gaucho n my opinion. I would put it joint 3rd with Mash. The sides are also a crucial part of any lunch for me, and Hawksmoor nailed it here. Superb Mac n Cheese, great Chips and amazing creamed Spinach. Put everything above together and add in some lovely cocktails and this certainly one of my favourite meals and restaurants. It can't get 5 stars because it just wasn't a 5* steak but it's not far off overall.Hawksmoor has a few restaurants, and this is for me its most' upperclass'. Bring the parents, not the party. But do bring someone as it's well worth it!",

Perfectly cooked beef, roast potatoes, a giant Yorkshire pud, cabbage and carrots were delicious.The meal was rounded off with some salted caramel rolos and a \"post-prandial\" as they call them. The cocktails and beers make it pricey (but worth it!) but you could easily do Sunday lunch for two for \u00a360 and that's including a great red wine.Finally, I have to mention the service It never disappoints.

    "text": "For all its hype and supposed mantle of being the best place for steak, I was rather bemused at how underwhelming I found Hawksmoor. In fairness I only have people to blame for the expectation and not the restaurant itself as word-of-mouth was that this place was THE place for steak but upon entering you can see that the staff are down-to-earth and unassuming despite these legendary claims. In fact the sincere and diligent service was far more memorable than most of the food itself. Having said that, I'm not sure I agree with the lack of uniformity in dress code of their staff as their clothing is so casual with no defining similarity that any prankster could probably start picking up plates and bills if they wanted to. So eccentric are the staff that our waiter limps due to a skateboarding accident, cracks jokes at every opportunity and describes the food with endearing enthusiasm, meanwhile we are told that the waiter for the table next to us tore his tendons in two fingers by pulling back a chair too vigorously while on the job. Thus, I'm not sure I've ever seen such exuberance from restaurant staff before.\u00a0On the whole the food and drink was less remarkable but I shall endeavour to share whatever thoughts they did stir up. First off I ordered a Comte Papa cocktail which fell into the trap as many cocktails do of describing all sorts of ingredients to excite your senses on the menu and yet not delivering in the glass; ultimately the drink was anticlimatic and plain. I then ordered the Cornflake Shake which was pleasant enough with a delicately smooth milk (not too thick), a gentle cornflake taste (without too much added sugar) and a few flakes of cornflake on top.\u00a0Now for the meal: for someone ordering for themselves you are restricted in what types of steak you can choose from as for some impractical reason you cannot order small portions of T-Bone, Bone-In Prime Rib, Porterhouse or Chateaubriand. Not that I mind terribly what steak I get but being restricted by the size of the portion seems unnecessarily unfair. In any case I selected a rib-eye steak medium-to-well-done. I was thereafter served with what could only be described as a well-done steak which to me seemed a little tough and overly salty - certainly nothing to rave about. I had the peppercorn sauce which I was grateful for simply because it served as a welcome masking of flavour to the salty but otherwise lacking in flavour steak. I also ordered the Grilled Bone Marrow for novelty value as I have not eaten bone marrow before and it proved to be suprisingly tender and retains a not unpleasant smoky flavour. Much to everyone's suprise I also ordered another main: half a lobster - from which the lobster meat was permissable but not as good or as hearty as the one from Burger and Lobster and yet I found the garlic sauce that accompanied it to be more pleasant than in B&L as it was less dense and not overpowering with garlic. I would award the label of best quality side to the Macaroni Cheese as this was a hefty side with well melted cheese and delightfully crispy crumbs on top (although if we are making comparisons its equivalent in Shackfuyu was a bit better as it had softer macaroni pasta); the Roast Field Mushrooms are also a welcome side to have - large and a good texture; and the sides of Creamed Spinach and Asparagus were just as their names suggest (nothing untoward there).\u00a0Frankly my palate was not particularly impressed at this stage of the meal but luckily I could convince myself to consume more by way of dessert - for this dessert was unexpectedly incredible. I don't know if the fact that I had low expectations at this point accentuated the effect, but this dessert sure did give me a high. It was a peanut butter shortbread with salted caramel sauce and honeycomb ice cream. The shortbread and salted caramel was warm and fused together to achieve a lovely melting glory within your mouth, then balanced with the smooth cool and gently flavoured ice cream, altogether made for a masterpiece of a dessert. Despite having eaten more than my fair share of food, I found myself wondering if I should order another portion of this heavenly dessert; but I refrained for the sake of my bursting stomach. Courtesy of our chummy waiter we were treated to a Hawksmoor rolo each and my are these an explosion in your mouth - like a supremely rich and sweet chocolate and caramel bomb!In conclusion, if we're focusing on steak then from my experiences I preferred steak from Gaucho, Steak & Co. or even a local pub in Carshalton more than at Hawksmoor. In fact based on this (my first visit of Hawksmoor), on any next visit I would very much be tempted to have a couple of sides and skip the steak altogether, then just indulge in the dessert. This is certainly not the outcome I anticipated but the truth can come as a surprise sometimes.",

The dull 70's like interior with brass panelled walls, turquoise details \u00a0and dark teak floors did make sense to my taste buds. The ambience was rather stark and pretentious. The food was just average with scampis for a starter in a very mellow white wine sauce. It needed a bit more for me. Perhaps an extra pinch of salt or more herbs. The presentation could have been better too. Overall I give credit to good service, excellent wine selection and convenient location. Just not my glass of champagne!",

This recent visit, was amazing, and one of the best meals I've had in recent memory, in big part down to the amazing waiter who served us. We ordered cocktails and a bottle of wine to start. However he suggested a different cocktail as the one I ordered was apparently much too filling and we'd have been unable to eat our steaks. He intuitively offered bread to a friend to dip in her mussel sauce. Not to mention my brixham crab on toast was mouth watering, with crab so fresh and the perfect amount of cream. My rib eye was also perfectly cooked. When my friend couldn't finish her steak, he packed it for her even though she didn't ask. At the end of the meal, the waiter brought us that cocktail I first ordered.. But on the house! Mind blown! You don't even always get such service at Michelin starred restaurants",

I had another one that I can't recall. But everyone around me enjoyed their drinks very much. out of a table of about 10 there were NO complaints. Coming from our group thats pretty much unheard of. Awesome place. Next time i'll have to try the food.",

    "text": "My colleagues rave about Hawksmoor all the time and finally I was able to try it on this latest trip to London. They're not crazy about this- Hawksmoor was incredible. I can understand the buzz and why it was still difficult to get a reservation on a random Tuesday at the Air Street location.I love the Air Street area-this cool little place rammed in between Oxford and Piccadilly. There are pubs, a few high end restaurants and most importantly-a Whole Foods. While it's not that hidden-you do feel like you've just \"discovered\" this nook in the city every time you visit. Hawksmoor continues this feeling with their non descriptive facade and dark restaurant interior. You almost feel like you've been granted entrance into some sort of exclusive steak lover's club. Even on a Tuesday; the place was crowded and really lively-definitely my kind of scene. We were seated at the end of a banquette and got straight to ordering. Our server, who joking went by \"Guacamole\" had stellar recommendations for us and we followed them all. We did a little surf and turf with the lobster and Chateaubriand cut. They were both mouthwateringly tender and bursting with flavor. I had never had a Chateaubriand cut before and I can tell you that I'll be trying it again. For sides I would recommend the mushrooms (I would have eaten just these for dinner) mac and cheese and spinach with lemon and garlic. The mushrooms and the spinach paired really nicely with the light fattiness of the steak and the cream mac and cheese complimented the lobster quite well. We didn't save any room for dessert but our server pressed a box of salted caramel chocolates on us as we left. It was very sweet and they were very good. I now know where I'll be getting my steak in London from now on. Hawksmoor really wowed me and with their multiple locations they surely dominate the steakhouse scene in the city.",

The field mushrooms were a great side and if you go you must get the Mac and cheese! We have been in Europe for 10 days and this was by far our best meal.

Desert was fantastic though, I had a sticky toffee pudding and it was the best I've ever had. In my entire life.

It's very art deco. \u00a0If smoking were permitted indoors, I feel like everyone would have a cigar and brandy after dinner here. \u00a0My friend and I were on vacation to London, and chose this location of the Hawksmoor for our last night in town before heading on to Paris. \u00a0We were not disappointed. Starting out with a few great cocktails and some baked scallops, we each ate about half a cow, and I opted for the buttered greens as accompaniment to mine. \u00a0It was the perfect pairing with the juicy steak. \u00a0And as if all of that wasn't enough, I killed a sticky toffee sundae by myself. \u00a0Trust me, I paid for that dearly later when I woke up in the middle of the night with acid reflux, but it was worth it. \u00a0Service was excellent, and my only real complaint was hearing one of my fellow countrymen's voices carrying loudly over the rest of his table, and the entire dining room floor. \u00a0Small price to pay for one of the best meals I've had all year.",

The cocktail menu, categorized by time of day, from right out of bed to cigars and poker, occupied me while waiting for my friend. London, so of course lots of gin. Pretty cool tab transfer to table via name on our reservation. Ready to eat, another pair of hostesses walked us into the dining room. Two of us were seated at a four top - nice elbow room. \u00a0Our personable server asked where we were from and explained the menu. The mussels we ordered as a starter were laughably small, but the sauce was delicious. Medium rare filet (British Beef) was mothwatering and tender. \u00a0Our sides, Mac & cheese and garlic spinach, were delicous, but hardly large enough to share. Our bone marrow ran late, so we weren't charged. Our server was very apologetic and professional.Ended with a scoop of blood orange sorbet, cleansing the pallet before walking off our meal. \u00a0159 GBP - not bad considering the quality of food and 5 drinks.",

    "text": "Firstly let's get to the point. Everything was great but the Steak....man the Steak was perfect. The best I've had in a while. You can tell they know their meat and you know why you pay the price for it. Only part of food I was a little disappointed with was triple cooked chips. Not piping hot not as crunchy on outside as I remember.The server was attentive and friendly with the meal great all the way through.One thing I must admit that disheartened me was upon ordering nearly 1kg of Porterhouse was that although I did ask my main server that I wanted to take bone away along with a few left over pieces of cut steak (and a little spinach I had left) was that another server (who randomly came in to ask if plates to be taken away 5 mins later - I know he was being efficient and courteous but those things confuse if not same server). I did tell him I wanted it all to be put in bag but when he came back only the pieces of steak were given back.In America everything is put in the bag. One- it's all the customers now (i was going to give my dog juicy fat porterhouse bone) and spinach was to with my steak but as no wastage either! That kind of saddened me actually. It didn't totally ruin my meal of course, but It did make the experience not as great as I had hoped. Even though me and my dad for fathers day had a great time. He did love his steak but we were miffed that not everything was presumed to be put in bag. l kept spinach behind on purpose too. Might be one for servers to at least ask customer first, or at least make it mandatory that everything is put in bag. The bone is actually a cool piece as it's not as if it's little worthless bone. It was something to marvel at when it arrived on table too. A talking point. I have conveyed this feedback to them also, and I'm sure they will take it on board.Will be back for sure. I think the Seven Dials or Spitalfields is still the best branches, just that last final bit of (service) of an expensive meal let it down for us. Still an awesome brand and kings of steak.",

As a vegetarian I was worried going in but the food was outstanding. I had a fennel starter as a main on recommendation of the staff and it was delicious, but not on the online menus. Meanwhile, the father in the equation managed to see away a steak that clearly made up for my misgivings. The service and wine recommendations were some of the best I've had, especially when the place was so full on a special day. Would recommend absolutely!",

    "text": "A great location and small entrance does the not give justice to the actual scale of the resturant. I have been to the Knightsbridge branch and this is huge compared to this. You have a grand staircase and leading up to a great lateral space with two bars and ample space in an art deco style with stained glass windows. Next time will look to take more photos of the actual seating areas and bar. I added some notes to the booking and I was happy to see all my notes followed to a tee and this is attention to detail that I find impressive. You do have a bag and coat check area at the entrance by the way so do not worry if you arrive from a hectic day if shopping you will be relaxed and free of bags and jackets at the table. Just remember to collect on your way out! We ordered some Mock-tails with one specially made which at first we did not like and it was changed and altered as requested with no fuss. The food knowledge of the server was ok but not explained fully as I have experienced in the past so did not feel totally convinced with what we actually ordered. We were guided towards the Sunday Roast and a different cut of steak than we usually order as well as being cooked to a different degree so unfortunately we did not really rate the meat which is the main reason for coming but we will look to visit again and have what we usually have to see if that was just us being guided in the wrong direction for our taste and revert back with another review I hope in the future. Happy with the Sunday Roast gravy and Salad as well as the dessert. Service was good and always nice to see happy staff so cannot really fault staff attitude.\u00a0\u00a0Dress Code: Anything although most people where smart and smart casual.\u00a0\u00a0Ambience & Acoustics: This is where we hit a little bit of an issue like most large restaurants, during peak times you suffer from a lot of ambient noise so if you like this thats great but when you are looking to have a nice chat then I would recommend maybe taking a table by the bar area which seemed less busy so I would hope would be a better location to be seated if you want a nice conversation. Music however was not loud and just offering light background noise.\u00a0\u00a0Drinks:\u00a0 There was a couple of options for Mocktails and would be good to see more options offered to be honest. But the bar was happy to mix something up and even happy to change it when the first one did not come out right.\u00a0We had the following:\u00a0\u00a0Ribeye 400g - A large cut where you would struggle to eat the whole thing and not sure why you are not offered smaller cuts. I know from my last visit you are encouraged to share large cuts but when you both have different tastes I cant say this always works. Not a cut we are used to and not cooked the way we usually have so again not too impressed but will have to re-visit and have our usual and reserve comment.\u00a0\u00a0Sunday Roast - A nice option with large portion size with large Yorkshire pudding with nice roast potatoes and veg, but the meat was hard work to cut and just average like a nice pub lunch but nothing special. The gravy however was special and really made the dish with a rich meaty flavour that really set off the Yorkshire pudding well as without this the Yorkshire pudding would have been too dry.\u00a0\u00a0Triple cooked chips - It seems everyone now does triple cooked chips but not everyone does them well and nothing special here and although nice thick cut it was not as crispy or as fluffy inside as you would expect.\u00a0\u00a0Doddington Caesar Salad - A light crispy really fresh salad that complimented the main really well and not over complicated but just perfect. Highly recommend this side.\u00a0\u00a0Bone Marrow - Two large marrows served and cooked well and presented well.\u00a0\u00a0B\u00e9arnaise Sauce - I am not really a fan of b\u00e9arnaise so i cannot really comment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Desert: Sticky Toffee Pudding - So far I would say this is the best in London and worth the visit just for this. Soft and moist and this was even after a large meal we still managed to finish this.\u00a0\u00a0Bill / Cost: \u00a3108.00 for two\u00a0Conclusion: Dessert is second to none and server even mentioned there is another dish even better, so we will have to come back. Not too impressed with the meat but having been steered to different cuts I think we need to re-visit with what we are used to in order to give a true comparison. Hence the lower mark this time which I hope on a re-visit this will go up. Another great thing to say is the restaurant itself also followed up via email on the visit and if we had any comments to which I responded and received a response, so I was able to share this review prior which is another nice touch as it is nice to see they care and not many if any actually take the effort these days and wait for reviews to be posted rather than being proactive, so this was nice to see.",

Our Sunday roast at Hawksmoor was flawless. The gorgeous furnishings, the helpful service, the amazing food, and the excellent wine were all impeccable. We started with the half Dartmouth lobster and Doddington caesar salad, followed by heaping plates of Sunday roast accompanied by a perfectly balanced shiraz, then a sticky toffee pudding to share. The waiter, who was affable and helpful throughout, even arranged to extend our reservation so that we could finish our dessert without rushing. So much happiness. The lobster was cooked perfectly, accompanied by a nicely balanced herb butter, and absolutely delicious. The caesar came with anchovies, so I carefully ate around those, but the broad romaine leaves were nicely dressed, with a generous amount of Parmesan. The main attraction was the roast beef. It was served with duck fat roast potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, carrots, greens, and a lovely little pot of bone marrow & onion gravy. I don't usually like gravy, but even I couldn't deny the yumminess. And the sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream was just the right amount of sweet to share. For the price, the Sunday roast is a terrific value and the ideal way to enjoy one of London's best steakhouses. Make a reservation the next time you're in town. And bring me back some!",

I couldn't believe all they used to season it was salt since it was so flavorful! Our really cool Polish waiter said that their mac 'n' cheese here is bomb as well, but that will have to wait till next time.",

Not at all what we would have expected from a steakhouse or any restaurant. We actually left the steak at the table and filled up on the bread and sides that we had ordered Very disappointing, especially at this price point.

I wouldn't mind if I got the menu off yelp but it was on their main website where some restaurants in London don't do it and this one does (the reason I walked further to this one). I did bring this up with the server and hostess and they said the online menu is always wrong to which I explained but if he other restaurants have variations of the menu then why doesn't there's...Secondly I then order a number of sides I had eyed out as back up included buttered greens to then be told they don't do it anymore either, so again bad online menu and bad indoor menu.Thirdly I ordered a stout beer on arrival and it took over 20 minutes to get to me (only because I reminded my server), possible due to being on my own byt they weren't busy and there was no reason for stuff like that to be delayed. Whenever I used to work to restaurants I used to worry about 'secret shoppers' and if I was one right now then massive fail...Food was nice so that saved it being a two instead of a three but for the effort of getting there and service not enough...try harder next time.",

    "text": "This is some serious meat folks. This Hawksmoor is apparently also a seafood restaurant but none of us ordered a fish main. Given it was my first time to a Hawksmoor restaurant, I was aching to try their steak.Thanks to Linzi who manage to procure a reservation for the \"extended soft opening\", six of us found our way to Hawksmoor Air Street late on a Sunday night. Very late. We got there early and had a few drinks; I had the Ginger Brew, the Dandy and the Garden Party. (At least I think those are the names... I hadn't eaten most of the day so I got quite drunk on them). They were all extremely tasty and quite pleasant. We started out in the bar area which was upstairs outside the dining area. Comfy seating and elegant surroundings made for a great drinking experience. The dining area is huge by the way. They showed us to our seats and it just kept going. I swear i thought we were never going to get there. The six of us decided to split six starters. For me, the best starters were the potted beef and bacon with Yorkshires and the pork belly ribs. They were both packed full of flavor, but I think the potted beef might have been slightly better (for my tastes). The bone marrow was also quite tasty, and the chicory salad was a nice crispy and green offset for all the meat and fish on the table. The friend Queenies were alright. The tartare sauce was great, but deep frying scallops isn't, in my opinion, the best way to showcase the taste of scallops. The mussels were terrible. I'm the only one who thought so, but for me, they were just way too fishy and didn't taste of anything else. I had three, and they were all overly fishy. No one else complained, so either I was incredibly unlucky, or my palate for fishiness is spectacular. However, there were enough of the other mains that I didn't feel bad about having one out of six that wasn't exactly to my tastes.For the main, I had the rib-eye steak and a half lobster (and more bone marrow which I scooped all over my meat). We split sides: two orders of chips, some sort of mashed potatoey thingy with cream and anchovies, macaroni and cheese, and a sweet potato. They were all really good, and those chips were fantastic. We also got all the sauces to try. The bone marrow gravy was heavenly (especially on the chips). I liked both the blue cheese and the anchovy Hollandaise sauces. The Bearnaise was lacking a bit in flavor from the others, but I enjoyed all the ones I tried. The steak was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. The lobster was okay. The tail was tasty and cooked well, but my giant claw was a bit salty and waterlogged.For dessert, I had the peanut butter shortbread with salted caramel ice cream. Yummo! It was like a warm peanut butter cookie with ice cream. The center had peanuts and other deliciousness in it, and I just ate it all up. I tried a bit of the sticky toffee which was quite rich and decadent, but the most decadent of all was the Jaffa cake. I had a bite, and I'm not sure how someone could eat the whole thing. No wonder Anna was handing it out left and right. It had that wow factor in your mouth, but it was huge and rich! Andrew got the salted caramel rolos, which were awesome, but I was expecting something to look like rolos, and not just like chocolate covered caramels.Anyway, everything was great! The service was spot on, the food was pretty fantastic (even if there were a few things that were off). I'm looking forward to going back to Hawksmoor again to have more of their delicious meat.So thanks again Linzi for getting the reservation (and giving it to Andrew), and thanks Andrew for inviting me along. If you like a big hunk of meat, the Hawksmoor is definitely the place to go for it.",

BEEF DRIPPING FRIES! The name itself sounds like sex on a plate. We are bff now.Of course I not only had sides, I orderd the the roast beef. Apparently a must at this place. Order it pink, I usually order my meat medium rare, I don't know why I did not this time. The pink version really tastes like over the moon meaty and juice. It has a wonderful BBQ flavour. They have a cool cocktail menu, too bad I do not really indulge in cocktails at lunchtime but I would have loved to try loads of them ;)We also had \"pudding\" and we liked it. However, I do not remember what it was but it was small (thank god, we were stuffed!). Maybe rolos?I can't get over the fact that the sweet meal is called pudding. That's so funny. Being mainland Eurasian, for me a pudding is a creamy not too liquid dessert. But oooh, when I mentioned that to our British host at our table I feared he was less amused ;))",

    "text": "Hawksmoor Air St. is the latest branch of the hugely popular,swanky steak hangouts, but the advantage is they do seafood and proper fancy seafood equalling the might of the steak. Off Regent St, so great for a glam night out with friends or for refuge after shopping. Also, there is a good sized bar to kick the night off and then be led into a never-ending majestic, art-deco, main dining hall (like a panoramic photo) . Lots of wood pannelling and plush,jaguar-green, leather upholstery (v gentleman's club). Now, the food in a word, sensational. Begin your feast with lightly battered, queenie scallops with tangy, lush tartar saucenever had scallops like this before. Then the big decision, seafood or steak or get both between 2 of you, which worked a treat (no food envy). Then, condiment heaven anchovy hollandaise (a creamy dip of loveliness) and bone marrow gravy (packed with strong, gravy flavours). Final hurdle is the dessert, all yummy and don't forget the salty caramel rolos, the perfect end to the perfect belly- busting meal. My favourite place at the moment. Beware book ahead, vvvv popular and not cheap, but so worth it. You're worth it! (monikasays.com )",

That's the only way I can describe Hawksmoor Air St. It's the new version of this Covent Garden British steakhouse which has now expanded to Liverpool St, the City and Regent St. The prices aren't cheap, but you leave feeling completely satisifed, and I can't fault any of the food, the cocktails, or their wine list.The staff work hard to make sure you have a good experience, from offering free ice water, to offering free starters when there was going to be a delay with the food.

    "text": "Yes, it's another 5 stars for Hawksmoor.They just keep doing it. First thing I noticed about this location is the LIGHT. Bright, with gorgeous windows, the light bounced off the reclaimed metal and polished wood. I've usually been to Hawksmoor \u00a0in the evening, and most of them are downstairs. Natural light with my porterhouse is a rare treat.The place is beautifully decorated. I'm a big fan of the teal leather and the industrial metal/wood combo which is a running theme at their restaurants. They have a bar area, but on this Sunday afternoon it was empty and we moved straight through to take our table.It was the soft opening, so our waiter wasn't up to speed on everything; names of cocktails, cuts etc, but hey, that's what soft openings are for - and we were getting 50% off food to numb the pain.The food - excellent as always. Their scallops might just be the best seafood I've ever had. Order them immediately. We shared porterhouse and prime-rib cuts between the four of us, which arrived cut and seasoned in heavy metal dishes. The steak was exceptionally tender and tasty. With Hawksmoor you really do know where you're spending your money. The standard is excellent. We opted for a range of sides including field mushrooms, creamed spinach, chips and greens. My favourite Hawksmoor side continues to be the mushrooms -juicy and served with a peppery season.Sharing is caring and so we selected a number of the desserts and grabbed a spoon each. We took one bite of their salted caramel rolos (probably the cheapest thing on the menu?) and instantly ordered more. We hadn't even made progress into the other desserts. We just knew we needed more of those rolos in our lives. Incredible. Other dessert highlights were the Ferrero Rocher sundae and the plum and blackberry pie.We had some very well made cocktails and a tasty bottle of red to accompany our meal. We couldn't have been happier.7I'll be back to pay 100% soon.",

We decided to go to Hawksmoor as we've always wanted to try out their steak.We went for the express menu for a 3 course meal and the price (at \u00a326) suits us. I had the Potted beef & bacon with Yorkshires which is a complete meal on its own. The Potted beef & bacon was delicious and moist. It was full of flavour! I just wished they had more gravy as the Yorkshire pudding was a bit over done. The rib-eye steak was cooked to perfection. We were all happy with our greens and chips. The Peanut butter shortbread with salted caramel ice-cream was absolutely divine! Because we went for the \"express menu\", I was hoping our customer services won't be an \"express customer services\". It was completely the opposite to what I expected. Excellent customer services.

It's touted as offering the best steaks in town and I would probably go along with that.The roast scallops and Belly ribs starters are definitely worth a go. The Chateaubriand (medium rare) was cooked perfectly and was as tasty as any steak I've experienced.The service however was a bit of a let down. Our waitress insisted on overselling the quantity of food that we ordered, somewhat surprising given her svelte figure and that of my two companions. As it was we left the last slice of steak as we were full to bursting!Anyway, the upshot is I would go back again, fully versed with the quantities I need to order, as the food quality was excellent, although given the prices it might only be for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I was quite excited about the Hawksmoor but I have to say I left feeling unimpressed.Now I'm a pretty experienced chef so I know that I am more critical than the usual diner so instead of giving a long winded review I will break it down to where I thought they fell short.1. Firstly we waited over 30 mins for two cocktails on arrival, and they weren't busy, but in their defense \u00a0the wait staff acknowledged they had forgotten the order and we weren't charged for our beverages and at 9 quid a pop that was kinda cool, we honestly weren't overly bothered. But a mistake in any case.To be honest I actually wasn't impressed with the cocktails, so I was glad not to pay.2. We are a young couple that were obviously out to enjoy an intimate and romantic night and were to my horror \u00a0put in a terrible table position right in front of the bar, we were booked quite late so I'm sure we could have had a better table. I felt like I was being seated in sizzler....not the Hawksmoor.3. Once seated I noticed the decor (tables, floor, bar) look tired, scratched and worn out, the restaurant definitely didn't have a feel of being a hip vibrant stylish steakhouse.4. We decided to go for a three course meal package that was offered at a good price after 10pm, big mistake. The bill with wine and added sides was still reasonable high so please don't think that things went down hill because we chose the cheap option.5. The entrees were vastly different in size, my entreel was massive and my girlfriends entree might as well have been a canap\u00e9, plus my Yorkshire puddings were burnt, no bread was offered. Not impressed. 6. Next course was a 250g steak for myself and Fish for my girlfriend. My steak was under cooked, and nothing great, the \"triple fried chips\" tasted and looked liked old fries from McDonalds, the fried bone marrow was two whole roasted marrow bones cut in half that I would feed my dog.... the only thing that was enjoyed were the minted potatoes, my girlfriend enjoyed them....that says it all.&. Dessert was also unimpressive, very rich desserts with a tiny quenelle of ice cream and double cream on mine, badly portioned and nothing special. Pub food.The wine list also was average and over priced.So in closing...one word...rubbish...I hate giving bad reviews but to be honest I left thinking I would have had a similar experience at the local pub for half the price.On a positive note the service staff were all very friendly and accommodating.Sack the chef, do a bit of a refurbishment and maybe I might go back one day. Until then. Not a chance.",

    "text": "I wanted desperately for this to be a five star meal and has such high expectations I guess I was bound to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, we had a fantastic meal, but some little things were a little off, which I wasn't expecting. Let's start with the good stuff: obviously, the meat. It's incredible. The steaks are cooked to perfection and taste like cow. The triple fried chips are also spectacular. But really, the star of the meal for me was the stilton hollandaise. I could BATHE in it. I actually ended up eating it on its own off the plate because I just couldn't get enough - but it works best, obviously, as an accompaniment to the beef. The desserts were also excellent - I had the peanut shortbread because salted caramel ice cream will make me order anything... my husband had the baked alaska which for my taste was too passion fruity and tangy, but he loved it. Perfect meringue. We skipped starters, knowing that we were more tempted by the sides and that the steaks were big - this turned out to be a wise decision. \u00a0We had a steak each, off the 'always available' part of the menu: a bone in sirloin, and a rib-eye. If I go again, I'd ditch the sirloin though, rib-eye is the way forward. The place itself is like something out of Mad Men, you can imagine the after dinner cigar smoke curling up to the ceiling... and the windows are particularly beautiful. It does feel special. So, the little things that added up to that minus star:The dining room is spectacularly noisy: not great acoustics here. The cocktails we had, having stellar expectations, were pretty bland. I tried a garden party - it tasted like a weak aperol spritz - and the hawksmoor collins is nothing to write home about. Perhaps it's my fault - I just couldn't bring myself to try butter infused bourbon then eat half a kilo of beef, but I wish I had now. The spinach and garlic side dish although okay was in my view massively overpriced, and ditto the Jansson's Temptation which lacked the oomph we were hoping for and was a little grainy. Weirdly, although the space feels special - and this is something I would never normally comment on, but it jarred here - the staff are really dressed down. Like, jeans and trainers dressed down. I found that a bit... 'oh'. If I'm paying upwards of \u00a375 a head for dinner, I like to get a bit dressed up, and so then found it a bit odd to feel overdressed because of the staff. They were all lovely and friendly though. Don't get me wrong, I will be back: knowing that a single portion of hollandaise is plenty for 2, the greens are a waste of time, and a dessert can be shared.... I can save enough cash to try that butter bourbon.",

The restaurant and separate bar are upstairs which is spacious and attractively set up. The only criticism I have of Hawksmoor is that the restaurants are very dark. I would like to be able to read the menu without getting my flashlight out.In our party of four we tried the shrimp on toast starter, the smoked salmon and the crab. Everyone was very happy with their choice and the plates went back clean. Main courses were Dover sole, offered on or off the bone, fillet steak and sirloin. The fish was pronounced good, the steaks were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. For sides we had the beef dripping fries (overcooked), mash and gravy (gorgeous), lovely creamed spinach and mushrooms. We went the whole hog and had the honeycomb sundae and the salted caramel tart. They were both delicious, especially the latter, which was flawlessly balanced. The wine was excellent, as was the service throughout. A wonderful dining experience; can't wait to return.",

Service was a little slow but I think many would find it beneficial to sit and chat and relax between courses. I just wanted to be out a little quicker to site see some more. The Caesar salad was bland. The rump was very good and required no sauce and apparently is one of the best tasting steaks here despite being the cheapest. My brother got a t-bone which he said was just ok. He said the side of mushrooms was very good and much better than his steak. He also got a side of lobster but they must've forgotten because he didn't get it until 15-20 minutes after the rest of our food despite asking for it to be brought out at the same time. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert since everyone seems to love it. I find it to be slightly too sweet but the clotted cream on top helps tone it down. Nice atmosphere. Seems like a good place for a romantic date. Can be a bit pricey depending on what you get especially since they also charge for things like sauce. But I honestly don't think the sauce is necessary with how the steak is cooked.",

You could happily dress up to the nines and dine out here for a special occasion, as much as you could grab a causal mid-week dinner in your ripped jeans and converse. We tried one of their (really excellent) cocktails, but no more as we were conscious of over-spending, which believe me you can do in a heartbeat at this place! But that's not to say that I felt it was over-priced, far from it actually, when food is this good I'm happy to slurge. And that's why this place shines- the food, more specifically the steak, is just sooooo good. We had a couple of starters that were really decent but didn't exactly blow us away I have to say, but the t-bone we shared was INCREDIBLE. I don't know how it does it, but a smear of anchovy hollandaise completely took the meat to another level. a-mazing. The only very small downside was that the peppercorn sauce I ordered was quite thin which was a bit of a downer for me, but not enough to knock off a star. Loved it.",

    "text": "The steak was very good but I wasn't that impressed by the triple cooked chips (a bit dry), and I think at those prices it's outrageous that you pay separately for sides. Very expensive. Restaurant also incredibly loud, we spent the evening shouting across the table at each other to be heard (tables are quite wide). Not somewhere for a romantic meal, or a catch up with a friend - choose somewhere quieter...Not sure I'll be back for the restaurant, for that money I think you could have better overall experiences elsewhere in London. The cocktail lounge looks cool though, so would happily check that out before heading elsewhere for food",
