I took girlfriend here on a Friday night - luckily called ahead and made a reservation.I actually got this establishment off of Yelp - ahh how this website never steers your in the wrong direction. We sat down and ordered a bottle of Rose and their fantastic mussels. It was a long drawn out dining experience, and I cannot think of anywhere else I would have rather spent two hours eating and drinking.For our main courses I ordered their Duck breast while girlfriend ordered their braised shank steak. Both dishes were fabulously prepared to our lofty expectations.When we were complete, another bottle of Rose came out along with their Cheesecake.Two hours and about 2000 calories later - and we were both smiling ear to ear.Bravo Le Mercury.",

    "text": "Overall an excellent experience. I came here on a Friday night (with a reservation) with two other people. This restaurant has some sort of \"shift\" system, I think, where all the diners come in at once. I arrived a little before 9:15pm (for a 9:15 pm reservation) and the place was empty; by 9:20pm it was full and buzzing. I've never seen this system before but I suppose there could be some advantages.The restaurant itself is lovely. We sat on the first floor, where large windows look onto the street. Nicely arranged tables and decor. I would say it seemed a bit noisy at times, but I am sometimes a bit sensitive to loudness. (I loathe most night clubs.) The bathrooms in the basement are a bit lackluster, so I didn't spend much time down there.The servers were good and attentive. We ordered a very nice bottle of merlot and to start shared mussels and poached pear with walnuts and blue cheese; all were very good. I had the roast chicken as entree and it was great, very tender and moist. I sampled my companions' dishes as well - sea bass and duck - and both were succulent to say the least. The portions did not seem like much but the richness of the foods really filled me up. We also squeezed in some dessert - creme brulee and the dark chocolate tort. Delicious they both were.The main draw of Le Mercury, though, has to be the prices. Wine: appx. \u00a315 for a bottle, starters \u00a33.95 each, entrees \u00a37.95 each, desserts \u00a32.95 each. For London these prices really are unheard of. I will recommend this place to everybody, and I hope to go back soon.",

The first floor, I could tell was more date-ish, but the second/third floor I was on was great because it was groups of friends (Some dates, not all) and it was just a great friendly atmosphere.Service: Fantastic. Nothing to complain about!Food: - Appetizer: Mussels in a broccoli sort of soup? It was good! Good amount and the sauce/soup it was in was delicious. I've had moules frites (in Belgium!) and this was definitely good in comparison to it.- Pork with confit: I thought it was a bit dry. I ate all of it.. minus a bit of the pork. My friend go the lamb which she enjoyed and I thought had a good flavour to it.- Dessert: Pear- YUM. Bottom Line: Decent prices, decent food. Even though I went with just a girl friend, we liked to say that it was definitely a 'romantic' dinner date, ahahha ;)",

Almost everyone who comes here likes it and I'm afraid I'm part of the crowd now.An intimate and ambient restaurant which spans three floors (apparently anyway, I entered at ground level - as you may expect - and stayed there), Le Mercury does the romance without the finance.The menu isn't particularly extensive but manages variety with main meals like steak, duck, chicken and a couple of fish dishes as well as two or three vegetarian options. I had a goats cheese thing for a starter and a pork belly thing for a main - lovely. There are many drinks choices. A place I'll definitely return to.TTFN, Ian",

The blue and yellow interior might lead you astray however with a simple menu and excellent prices, Le Mercury is everything French and nothing less. The crayfish and lobster ravioli was minutely salty for my liking but was succulent enough to still enjoy. At \u00a32.95 a plate, it's alright to order the entire dessert menu.. if only I could stomach everything, I would. Mascapone cheese Cake - a lighter alternative but still as rich and as enjoyable as a normal cheesecake. Love, love, LOVE!",

Why would I forget? \u00a0 Probably there is a curse on the entrees like in a French fairytale that goes like, \"The food here will be so great and amazing you will feel like you have found the perfect food, BUT you will forget about its amazingness shortly after digesting it\". Curses!But, this is one of my favorite spots in London- so long as I remember it exists. The entrees are delightful. I had pork belly on a bed of (not over cooked) cabbage covered in a berry sauce that my taste buds singing the opening of \"The Sound of Music\". Actually, I refer to this place as French-ish, because I'm not sure if it is supposed to be totally French (mainly because its such an unassuming and friendly place. Ooooh burn, France!)The most magical thing about this restaurant are the prices.... you will do a double take when you get the bill. I heard somewhere that this place is like a training restaurant for chefs or something but I don't care.... I really don't. I just want to go there again and again. I think I may be in love with a restaurant....I think it gets pretty busy on the weekends so you may want to make a reservation but it does stay open until 1 so its perfect for a late, late dinner.",

This also meant that we got our food very quickly ( a bit too quickly..we were in and out of the door within 40 minutes). Saying that the food was very nice. The prices are so reasonable because of the fast turn around and it is obligatory to order sides with your mains as you won't get any veg or carbs on your plate. All in all a nice little place to go if you don't want to spend hours on your meal or have a play/film to catch.",

For starters my partner and I ordered the lobster & crayfish ravioli and the fried calamari. The lobster and crayfish ravioli was a bit overpowered by the dill stuffed inside and wasn't amazing. The fried calamari is horrendous and I can make better at home but for not even 4 pounds a pop I guess I can't complain. I ordered the duck, and it was very overcooked, but the flavors were good. The garlic mash is delicious. My boyfriend had the lamb and also said it was good but overcooked. I would probably return and ask them to cook everything a bit less than they normally would. The price is terrific and a 5 min walk from my flat, so what's not to love?If I could I would rate it 3.5 stars",

None of us were French food snobs, but we all thorough enjoyed the lamb, salmon, gnocchi, and casserole (though the casserole was a bit bland and very heavy on the beans). The apps were great, and paired very well with our French wine.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with what a nice dinner like this cost us. Check their website for details.

Really! But I don't feel right giving it five stars just because. The food has been solid every time I've been there, but it's not the best ever. When I take the first bite of a meal in Paris, I often have to close my eyes because it's so delicious and I want to melt. That magic was not recreated here, but it is still really solidly GOOD food.

The food was not great though - my crab starter did definitely taste of crab but in a way that made me wonder if it had gone straight from a tin to a plate. Pork belly was pretty good and the dessert was standard. I'm giving it 3 stars because of its incredible value even though 3 courses for \u00a315 in London shouldn't be something of a miracle, unfortunately it is and so thanks Le Mercury for that. But really on food quality it's more like 2 stars, based on my one experience there.",

All starters cost \u00a33.95 and all main courses at \u00a36.95. They do have a changing daily menu with more expensive options, but they are only at \u00a37.95. Portions are rather big, making this an extremely good value place. The main courses were a bit slow to arrive, but the service in general was very prompt. The menu has a french slant, with many British dishes as well. Unusual ones include frogs legs, along with the traditional steaks and leg of lamb.",

These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town. Let's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table. It was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at \u00a33.95We ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.For mains which were all price at \u00a36.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with saut\u00e9ed spinach and lobster sauce. We all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie.",

However, the atmosphere, wine, food, and wine all seem to make this a safe bet. I've tried the lobster ravioli, the duck (err... canard), the potato dumplings, the salmon, the sea bass, and a couple of the desserts. All were either very good or great. For some extra Frenchness, they refused my sister's simple meal modification request- no, the sauce could not be had on the side. Authentique!The best part is that it is so inexpensive. Considering how good the food is, 8 quid for a main course is a steal. That means you will have some money left over to treat your special lady to a couple drinks at that most romantic of bars just down the street- Slim Jim's Liquor Store! No way will that date not end well, eh?",

It's definitely not the most bomb-diggity French food I've ever had, but for the price and the atmosphere, I think this place is worth a try. I had mussels to start and the lamb for my main. The mussels were good. The lamb was a tad chewy, but pretty good. I only got it because it was recommended to me by the waiter.My friend ordered the gnocchi, which was sub-standard. My other friend had the foie gras and the duck. Due to the only-child syndrome, she didn't offer to share, so I'm not sure how those tasted, though I'm assuming she enjoyed it since she licked her plate clean. All in all, I think this place is a good find just because affordable, decent French food is hard to come by. Just don't expect your taste buds to be blown away.",

My wife had pork belly which was meltingly tender and our side dishes of vegetables (with rosemary) and frites were also very well cooked. For three courses a la carte with a bottle of red and 2 sides, the lot came in at a little under \u00a350. Virtually unheard of at any restaurant on Upper St, or for that matter in London!

Its like the blueprint for a successful restaurant! We went one Monday night with friends. We had a cocktail at John Salt beforehand (2 for 1 until 8pm!) and then headed to Le Mercury. We had an upstairs table and service was great-attentive, but not over the top. We all had three courses (huge treat on Monday) but portion size means you don't feel too full. Between us we tried the moules, ravioli, carpaccio and calamari for starters. The calamari was a little disappointing, but all the other starters were excellent. They all cost \u00a33.95, so pretty amazing value. All mains are \u00a38.95. I had the duck which was served on a bed of garlic mash and with some cabbage. If I had one quibble it would be that the duck was slightly over-cooked, but I understand not everyone likes pink in the middle duck. The garlic mash was amazing- I would've been happy with a bowl of that and a spoon! Other people had the lamb, seabass and rib of beef all were well cooked, and the fries the boys ordered were yummy. For desert I had creme brulee. Not bad for \u00a32.95, but the topping could've been slightly thicker. Others had the cheese platter, the rich chocolate tart and the cheesecake. All plates were practically licked clean. We shared two bottles of a decent cab sav and the bill came a few pounds over \u00a3100, pretty incredible value! The food here will never blow your socks off, but it's a dependable neighbourhood bistro and we'll continue to come here regularly. Until next time Le Mercury....",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at Le Mercury. We decided to go someplace for dinner before a friend's birthday party and we just ended up here. It's advertised as a French restaurant, but there's a bit of other stuff as well. Unless you get a special, the starters are all \u00a33.95, the mains \u00a38.95 and desserts are \u00a32.95. So given the price, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However, my lobster and crab ravioli was really nice (although the sauce could have had a bit more flavor), the duck was tasty (although it was more medium well than medium rare) and the cheese dessert (for \u00a32.95) was three massive slices of brie, gruyere and blue. While the food wasn't perfect, it was cheap and it was tasty, so that's a bonus. They also had a fairly interesting wine list, and the wine we chose was really tasty and went great with the duck. Finish it off with a glass of port and it was one of the cheaper meals we've had in quite awhile.So if you're on the lookout for cheap and tasty food, head here. We didn't have a reservation, and showed up at 6:15, and they told us they'd seat us if we could finish in an hour. Which we did. So they're willing to squeeze you in as well. (I imagine it's one reason they can keep prices so low, a huge turnover).",

I've had bites of my friends' Crayfish and Lobster Ravioli and Beef Carpaccio, and both were very good as well. For the main course, the first time I went I had the pork belly, which I must admit was a little dry. But I won't hold it against them because the next two times I got the duck, which was delicious. I always get the french fries as a side and it is a good size to share for two. For two starters, two mains, a side, a dessert, and a bottle of wine, you're looking at about \u00a350 for two, which is a good deal for the area and a total dining experience.",

The menu isn't huge but everything that's on it is done very well and pretty cheap for saying how yummy it is. All starters and sides are around \u00a33, mains are \u00a38 and all desserts are \u00a34. Recommend the duck, if you have the chance.  Unfortunately they stopped doing the dark chocolate truffle cake with Baileys ice cream. The second best thing about Le Mercury is the general cosiness of the restaurant. It's quite plain but not austere, and though it's lovely in summer I've always preferred it on a cold evening. It's one of those few restaurants thats perfect for a date or meeting lots of friends.The atmosphere is cosy-a bit dark though. Make sure to book in advance.Best French restaurant in Islington.",

Le Mercury is the total package: the price, the atmosphere, and of course the food. Eating out in London is expensive, too expensive... so I really appreciate Le Mercury that much more. All starters: \u00a33.95. All main courses: \u00a38.45 + side salad or fries or veggies for only \u00a31.95. I ordered: Selle d/Agneau au Romarin (Roast saddle of lamb with grilled courgettes & rosemary jus). Boneless lamb, no fat, medium rare and cooked to perfection. I have to say that I judge a restaurant by how well they cook their lamb because most of the times it's too dry or too gamy. Le Mercury's lamb was perfectly seasoned, no chewy rubber band like parts, just the right amount of meat to sauce balance, I was 100% satisfied. My friend ordered: Boulettes de pomme de terre (Sauteed potato dumplings with baby artichokes, parmesan foam and wild rocket salad). I only had one bite (because I was too busy eating my lamb) but it was really really good as well.Seriously, this place is amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone.",

And the cream sauce on it was just enough, not too much or too little. The prices are right but the food is even better. Make sure you book in advance.

    "text": "I booked Le Mercury for a late Saturday dinner, thanks to all the brilliant recommendations from my fellow yelpers ;) Needless to say, I was not let down. What a find on Upper Street. Le Mercury is a great date spot. The ambiance is cozy and romantic, dimly lit. The restaurant was PACKED, all three floors even, so be sure to book. I booked about 4 days ahead and they only had one reservation for the whole evening left. Wowie.Prices are so reasonable! We weren't modest at all, with drinks or food, and our tab only came out to 38 quid! For our starter we had the goats cheese which is absolutely TO DIE FOR. It's a must paired with the French merlot on the menu. Take a nice bite of the cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For my main I had both the pear salad and the crab appetiser. The salad was lovely, the blue cheese and poached pair were the perfect combination. However, I was not a fan of the crab dish as it was made with mayonnaise, which I hate. I really wished they had clarified on the menu how it was made. BUT it worked out alright because I wanted to have room for desert anyway. My man enjoyed the duck entree, which he said was cooked perfectly and was \"out of this world.\" And yes, only for 6.95!The reason why I didn't give Le Mercury 5 stars is because the service isn't good. But I do personally think sacrificing the level of service to keep the ridiculously cheap prices IS worth it. However, we did always have to flag our waiter down and we weren't greeted at our table until about 15 minutes after sitting. But lets face it, they were packed and this place was hoppin. I understand.Le Mercury is a go! Book for a hot date with your Mr./Ms. and you'll score points!",

    "text": "Eating at Le Mercury was a bittersweet experience for me. The bitter part was the occasion - I attended a UYE here to say goodbye to one of my good London Yelp friends, Bea B who is moving abroadThe sweet part was dining here. Le Mercury is one of Bea's favourite London restaurants and with 65 reviews already, it must be one of London's most Yelped businesses at this time. These Yelpers, including some of my trusted Yelp friends with good palates, had graded it with a solid 4 stars, so I was looking forward to eating hereA perusal of the menu revealed a bistro style line up of French classics. Arriving at the restaurant, I found a setting and ambiance to match that relaxed bistro menu though perhaps, this stepped on the wrong side of shabby in the men's toilets which were in need of some refurbishmentWe didn't have snooty French waiting staff to complete the French atmosphere but our waiter was efficient if not exactly warm. Le Mercury has a nice pricing plan with all starters costing \u00a33.95, main courses costing \u00a38.45 and desserts costing \u00a32.95. which are very decent prices for this part of LondonThe food arrived remarkably quicky but the speed didn't mean sacrificing elegant presentation or suffering inaccurately cooked food. My roast Barbary duck breast had perfectly rendered crispy skin and moist meat, well complemented by garlic mash and Savoy cabbage with red wine jus. Asking round the table, there were murmurs of approval for rib eye steak and salmon though one of the steaks was a little under cooked.For desserts, I had a rich and decadent chocolate tart and the poached pear was so good that it was half demolished before I could get a photo of it.If Le Mercury was in France, we'd be nodding our heads sagely and admiring how it was produce well-priced and flavoursome food. So, to summarise, I'm nodding my head sagely and saying,\"Bravo, Le Mercury!\"And lastly, we'll miss you, Bea!!",

Menu is full of reasonably priced options. We did have to think a bit. Ended up with beef carpaccio (ehh) and poached pear blue cheese and roasted walnut salad (delicious) for appetizers. For the main course we did duck breast (cooked to medium rare with nicely crisped skin, fairly tasty however could have been a little more tender) and chicken breast (was decent though a tad dry). We enjoyed this with the house Chardonnay (middle of the road). Quick note although the menu says they charge \u00a31 for extra bread, they provided seconds free of charge. Apple tart tartine with creme fraiche (perfect finish to a very solid dinner). I enjoyed a glass of cognac and left with a smile. Would go back again. The ravioli (lobster and crawfish) seemed popular and looked good from a distance). Might ask for a window table if available and plan ahead for fri/sat reservations.",

    "text": "Le Mercury is a great neighborhood French bistro restaurant offering exceptional value for high quality food. For two people we ordered: 1. 1 glass of Pernod- the always enjoyable French terrace drink (that probably no French folks anywhere near my age drink)2. Mussels starter- white wine and garlic sauce that we dipped the bread in as well. This is one of the most flavorful mussels dishes we have eaten this year and at less than \u00a36 the best value. 3. Duck breast main- cooked a tad more medium than rare, however sauce was rich and good for winter. Potatoes soaked it up well. Also they switched out cabbage for grilled courgette which was nice. 4. Salad and seafood ravioli as a main (normally a starter)- baby girl got this. Very rich with high quality seafood stuffed inside. 5. Glass of dessert wine- Chilean. Went exceptionally well with the cheese platter. We are actively seeking out this sweet treat to have at home. 6. Cheese platter- they graciously switched out blue for more of the others. The others were Brie and Gruyere, the Brie served with perfectly sweet biscuits and the Gruyere with grapes. Bees was a little disappointing as it wasn't French baguette. Overall very happy wit this place. A cozy warm bistro atmosphere of friendly people who were very accommodating. Oh yea and a \u00a335 bill for a lot of food and drinks for two people. C'est la vie.",

What I love about this place is the consistency in quality, and the lack of artificial light (candles only after a certain time) so it makes for a really cosy atmosphere. My worst meal here was a Christmas group meal with friends. I hadn't realised the set menu would be quite so bland, and the toast which accompanied my pate was cold... Still, I will definitely continue coming here for meals with my boyfriend, or catch-up dinners with friends.",

For my main course I enjoyed the roasted duck breast. It was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. I finished the evening with creme Brule, which was, per usual, a delicate and tasty dessert. On top of the excellent food the atmosphere of Le Mercury is very well thought out. The candle lit tables are lovely and the decor on the walls is playful, yet also chic.

The sauce was tasty not too fishy but had a rich creamy taste and the contents of ravioli were cooked to perfection. My girlfriend ch\u00e8vre chaud. Goats cheese on a bit of bread with a green salad dressing. Everything on that plate complimented each other and tasted sublime! For main I had the entrec\u00f4te cooked medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had so rich and meaty but cooked to perfection. It was served with au jus and a side of french fries. It was a simple dish but tasted amazing.  My girlfriend had the corn fed chicken everything on that was great from the gravy to the beans. Desert well you guessed it, that was amazing as well. I had the poached pear with vanilla ice cream. Just great. Flavoured with cinnamon and cloves the pear was glazed with a crispy sugar shell. It was a light way to end the meal. My lady had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was pretty standard. We both agreed my desert was the best. The wine was great I had the Shiraz and my girlfriend had the Pinot Grigio. Also the espresso Martini was a great way to finish the meal. If you've read this far the. Thanks! All in all it was a great night. Very well priced for the food you were served and the atmosphere was typically french. A great french style meal in the heart of London that won't break the bank.",

I love this place so much that I have been back twice in the past week... don't judge me... The service is excellent as well. For starter I enjoyed the grilled goat cheese served on a pesto salad and it was perfectly done. Other people in my group seemed to really like their lobster ravioli starters. My husband chose the calamari but it was a little under done for my taste, not crispy at all so I would probably skip that one in the future. For mains my favorite so far is the Salmon served over sauteed spinach with a lobster cream sauce. Delicious! Other popular menu items among my group were the duck, the grilled swordfish, and the pork belly. All in all this was a fantastic meal at a great price. Perfection!",

Off the beaten path, yet worth the hike, take the Victoria Line to Highbury and Islington, turn right out of the station and walk 10 minutes to TravelValue heaven ... HOOAH!Arriving 30 minutes before our reservation, thanks to an extremely efficient Tube journey, we were greeted warmly and seated at a table in the dark, romantic room surrounded by tables with white linen tablecloths each with a large candle on top. We started with bottles of Ochagavia (Chile - \u00a316.95), an oaky, scrumptious cabernet sauvignon, and Hildon sparkling water (750 ml - \u00a32.50).The service impeccable, all starters are just \u00a34.45 ($6.15) and all main courses \u00a310.95 ($15.15 - except the steak which was \u00a312.95 - $18), a bargain for the quality and flavor. My wife ordered the Ch\u00e8vre Chaud Grilled Goats' Cheese starter with a salad garnish and basil pesto sauce and I had the Moules Marini\u00e8re (mussels) in a white wine and cream sauce with \"shallots, garlic, lemon and parsley\". The goat cheese tart was tastefully presented as well as being light, yet savory, and flavorful. My mussels were plentiful for the price, but there was little sauce and what was there was a tad bland with nary a hint of the shallots, garlic or parsley as noted in the description. Still, they were flavorful and a good value.For our main courses, my better half had the Asperges et Cheddar Tart, small cheddar tarts topped with asparagus spears in a balsamic reduction and a sliced avocado garnish in between the two. She did not care for the dish, as I thought might be the case, because of the balsamic vinegar which she is not a great fan of to begin with. I gave her half of my Entrec\u00f4te \u0103 l'\u00e9chalotte (grilled rib eye steak - \u00a312.95), served in a lovely shallot and red wine sauce, along with some of my chips (fries for you Yanks - \u00a31.95) in return her second tart. I thought that the tart was quite delicious, but I am quite fond of balsamic and the avocado garnish was a nice, complimentary addition.I was stuffed, so no dessert for me, but my \"sweet\"-loving wife \u00a0(she is \"sweet\" and \"loving too) had to have her favorite, Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (\u00a33.45), which was a bit on the small side, but scrummy nonetheless. At \u00a363.42 ($87.90), including a 10% service charge, we ate like kings and queens, appropriately enough. A comparable meal would have easily set us back $110-$125 in the States. The sole \"Bomb\" deduction is due to the not-so-flavorful sauce the mussels came in and the damp slice of bread that came in our first basket, which they apologized for and quickly replaced.CombatCritic Gives Le Mercury 9 Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!",

This place has a cosy warm vibe like it could be somebody's house with all the potted plants dotted around. We'd booked ahead (recommended!) so they'd saved us perhaps the best table in the far corner, meaning we got to enjoy our own little cocoon while looking out onto the street (and making eyes at each other ;), instead of facing inwards and looking at all the other tables.The food was quite basic but well executed, and the service smiley and efficient. The main calling card though is the price tag, with a flat price for all starters (\u00a34ish), another for all mains (\u00a310ish) and another for all desserts (\u00a33ish). I haven't seen that strategy anywhere else in London, and I think it probably makes people end up spending more!I had the starter of grilled goat's cheese and leafy salad which was a very generous size, and the sea-bass fillet main with crushed new potatoes and mint pesto which was simple and tasty. The dark choc tart dessert was a bit meh. Cocktails are limited but the wine selection a bit wider (we made use of both).So Michelin-starred cooking it is most certainly not, but for the romance of French food while saving the pennies I would definitely recommend!",

Food was below average, my friend's fish dish came uncooked and sauce was a mess. My steak was not medium rare, and the shallot sauce was very questionable. I was fooled by good Yelp reviews and how busy the place was (and maybe also for candles on the table)... Wish I followed my intuition after I saw cheap paper table cloth, paper napkins and that crazy, badly designed cocktail menu on the table. I had to take it away from me because it was literally burning my eyes and ruining my appetite. The only thing I was happy about was the service. The server was friendly and that was about it.",

    "text": "\"A beautiful story\"...? It has been quite a while since I visited this well known Islington French bistro. I read some reviews that made me uncomfortable but decided to go anyway. le Mecury is a well known Islington Upper Street establishment. I moved to the area in 2007 and have dined here with friends on many occasions. The restaurant was always busy so after a few years they opened another on Upper Street. The novelty of Le Mercury was that all the starters, mains and dessert were for a set price for their category. In 2007 the price was \u00a33.45 for a starter and the portion was on the lower side of generous. Now the price has gone up by \u00a31 and the portions are smaller. However this is inflation for you. After all Islington property prices have skyrocketed in that time. The food in general is good. My terrine was with spicy beetroot relish was nothing novel but tasted good. The salmon with new potatoes was well made. The salmon skin was fried perfectly and was crunchy while the fish was succulent. The creme brule was creamy with a hard sugar coating, as expected, and tasted excellent though maybe a bit smaller than I remembered. My wife also enjoyed her dishes of ravioli for starter, this apparently is the plural and should be raviolo as there was just one piece, and mushroom risotto. However the sticky toffee pudding was not very sticky, maybe best not to have English dishes at a French bistro :-)The service by the waitress was excellent. Yale, originally from Paris, was attentive and was happy to hear my mumblings about living in the area... Hence the title to my review \"a beautiful story\" which is to quote her. Of course there was no question in Yale's comment but I found it amusing that she used that phrase to describe my uninteresting story. The manager could possibly learn a bit more about a friendly demeanour from her. Is Le Mecury special? It used to be a different place to go in upper Street that was very affordable. Now however it is competing with alot of newer and exotic establishments. The paint and food might be a bit too tired for the younger professionals moving to the area. However I see no reason to disparage this still quaint establishments which is well worth a visit.",

The taste was nice and the portion was good with the amazing price.I would come again and want to see if they are served cold or not.But I wouldn't want to take a risk so perhaps ask them to serve while the food is hot .....",

The Ravioli de la Mer was excellent although you only get one Ravioli so don't expect to fill up on it. The sauce on the Ravioli was to die for. We soaked it all up with the generous bread basket. Entrees were Sea Bass (allegedly) that looked nothing like any Sea Bass I have ever eaten. It honestly looked and tasted like trout. That is what kept me from giving a five star review. My companion had the duck which was exquisite! Cooked perfectly and tender and juicy with crispy skin. Just as you would expect from a high end restaurant. I would definitely come here again.",

Everything was outstanding. The atmosphere is also very nice--kinda like a nice cafe style vibe. On one hand, it's elegant with candle lit tables and on the other it's not too pretentious. My only complaint is that the service felt a bit rushed. The restaurant wasn't too full and after some deliberating we decided it was because the service was poorly organized. Both waiters/waitresses were very attentive, but since they didnt seem to have control over one area and both worked the whole floor it meant that we got asked twice about everything and didnt get much breathing space. For example, we asked to have some more time to look at the menu, but someone was there asking for our orders two minutes later. This was my only complaint and the reason why they only received four stars.However, overall it was a very good experience at a great price and I wouldnt hesitate to come back!",

I came here last week to catch up with a friend and was very impressed. The candlelit atmosphere is dim and intimate with very cool decor. My friend and I decided to split a starter, Ravioli de la Mer, which was a lovely crayfish and lobster ravioli. It's perfect for one person, but since we split it we basically got a bite each. I decided to order the Magret de Canard (duck breast), which was really good. I loved the garlic mash that came with it! My friend ordered the Selle d'Agneau au Romarin (lamb), which was also fantastic! For dessert, we each got our own. I went with the mascarpone cheesecake and he went with the creme brulee. They weren't amazing, but still good nonetheless. I'd say it's the perfect date spot without having the break the bank. Great atmosphere and most importantly, great food!",

Is there such a thing?Yes, there is.After going to around 7 or 8 SportDirect stores all over London (my brother really wants this particular track jacket), I was exhausted, but it seemed a bit too late for dinner -- 10 pm on a Tuesday. However, I was hungry, and after shopping for the entire day, I really did not have many pounds left. Le Mercury was highly rated on Yelp, and it was still open (I called), so I made my decision. Let me tell you: best decision of that day.For one, they were able to accommodate me. Granted, I was coming in on central London, and I had called around 9 pm to see if there was any availability for one. Once I was there, I easily got a seat. The host and the hostess recognized my voice on the phone (damn my American accent) and were incredibly hospitable. I've eaten at Michelin starred restaurants, but the service I received was just the same -- at fraction of the menu prices.They have a set menu that you can find on the website, so I knew I was going to have the duck, but they also had specials which were written on the chalkboard above the bar. Everything seemed delicious. I listened to their recommendations, which was the seafood ravioli, which I gobbled up in a matter of seconds (I told you I was hungry). I was blown away at the fast service, and I guess the waitress knew the look on my face as she said, \"we tend to be fast here\". Maybe it was the fact that it was 10 pm, and I missed the rush hour for dinner, but once again, service was top notch.Because I ate every bite of both my meals, I was completely stuffed and could not order dessert. However, I will be back and perhaps give myself a little bit more room for more. Amazing restaurant for the quality of service and food at an incredible price. You can't go anywhere else.",

When someone suggests a French restaurant, you immediately think it's going to be pricey, but this couldn't be further from the truth. All of the mains are under \u00a37, desserts under \u00a33. So what did we have? Well we shared a starter of Crayfish and Lobster ravioli which was yummy. really nice. I think we were both a bit annoyed that we didn't order one each. But the mains were ace too - it's not a huge selection, but it's a good one. I had duck breast on garlic mash with cabbage. It had a great sauce, although I can't remember what was in it. The mash was really too garlicky for my taste, but the duck was perfect. Yummy yummy yummy. We didn't get a side of veg with our meals, but we did spie roasted potatoes and green beans on a nother table and were instantly jealous. My friend's mushroom rissotto was yummy too. Dessert was a mascarpone cheesecake. YUMMY! There was nothing bad about this place, it's a gorgeous little find. We booked ahead, and we might have been lucky but it's not a bad idea. The service isn't the best, but my friends and i were catching up so we didn't really mind that they didn't take our order for a while - in fact I think they were waiting for us to shut up! In the meantime we ate all of the bread that they gave us. Freshest bread eve. The place is open very late (1am on weekdays, 2am on weekends) so you could even pop in after going to the cinema. It's a little further up Upper Street than the main drag, but that's a good thing. If I was just looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat, I wouldn't have walked up this far. I'm so pleased I did! So one starter, one dessert and two very yummy mains, plus a couple of glasses of wine costs us \u00a326. Very impressed indeed. Do come here! On a date, with friends, whatever. Just come here. We were in such a mood for all things French that we've booked the Eurostar to Paris next month! Doesn't get much better",

Its no wonder that its always packed - but you don't have to wait long for a table. The steak was the best I've had in a while, soft and tender with a shallot sauce. At only 6.50 pounds, it was an absolute bargain! Starters are also very good, and around 4 pounds each. A bottle of wine is pretty reasonable at 10.50 as well. The restaurant gives the atmosphere of an intimate high end eatery, and the dim lighting and soft candles save it from looking like a bistro. This is a perfect place to go for a pre-theater or cinema meal, as the fast service won't keep you waiting long for a great meal. The Creme Brulee is still a simple favorite that is on the menu. Have with an espresso for the perfect meal!",

From the outside the dimmed lighting and minimalistic decor gives the impression of Le Mercury being an expensive snooty restaurant but it certainly is not.Another great thing about Le Mercury is the very fast service- an added bonus when you're feeling hungry and watch the other diners tucking into their delicious meals.",

Things can get packed in pretty tight, so it's best to make a booking (even on a Monday night at 8pm we wouldn't have been able to get a table if we hadn't already reserved one). The food is quite good, even if the menu isn't terribly extensive. My sea bass was fantastic, nice a crispy on the outside but really moist on the inside. Their desserts are really nice too, but don't expect anything on the lighter side. But the portions are perfect, just enough to leave you feeling satisfied without feeling stuffed. And things are relatively cheap with three courses costing only about \u00a315 (excluding drinks). It's a really good late night spot as well; they're open til 2, and they won't rush you if you want to sit around and chat after your meal. It can get a bit noisy in there, but still a good place to bring friends.",

The vibe is very French bistro and a bit like Lucien in NYC which used to be our favourite place for a mildly celebratory dinner so that's good. The restaurant is crowded but unlike a crowded NYC restaurant you aren't putting your elbows in your neighbour's soup. Tiny paper napkins and diner-standard flatware/glasses are all that's on the table. Meg arrives, we get the menus, and order drinks. We get glasses of tap water, which are never refilled, and a bottle of chenin blanc which turns out to be a 2008 from Long Beach winery in South Africa. This is a little sweet, but very nice - I like it a lot. The bread is pretty plain-jane white bread, but it has poppy seeds on the outside which make it better than expected. Meg has Tian au Crabe which is described on the menu as Tian of crab and avocado emulsion. What is a tian? We don't know which seems as good a reason as any to order it. It turns out to be something like crab salad. Meg seems to enjoy it. I have Chevre Chaud, grilled goat's cheese with fresh leaf salad and basil pesto. This is quite good although I think rather too heavy on the goat cheese and not heavy enough on the pesto as it's a little dry. The salad is nothing special and in fact I was hoping for more leaves. Weirdly, I guess, I'm asking for them to have more of the cheap ingredients in this dish. For mains, Meg gets Supreme de Poulet Roti - roast breast of chicken, garlic mash, green peppercorn. She seems to like it. I have Filet de Loup de Mer - sea bass with cauliflower puree, raisins, and chili lemon zest. Everything individually is good but they don't seem to go together that well. And that's it. We're tired, Meg seems to be coming down with something, so we skip out after just over an hour for under 40GBP. A great deal, convenient, decent food. We'll definitely be back.",

It's no fine dining establishment, but if you are looking for cheap, tasty and typically French cuisine - this is your Ronseal. (Does exactly what is says on the tin). Its dark enough to be intimate, but romantically lit with candles enough to see your dinner (and guest). The waiters are very efficient... some may say a little too eager to get you in, served and out, but I'm quite partial to a bit of efficiency on a cold wintery night when I'm starving. A three course meal will set you back \u00a317. And that's the entire menu - starters, mains and desserts are all the same price. Toilets are fairly interesting... but clean. We dined on Carpaccio of Beef, Fois Gras, Sea Bass, Belly Pork, Marscapone Cheesecake and Sticky Toffee pudding. Delicious. Can't comment on the booze as we were driving, but French wine isn't really my thing anyway. Oh - driving - easy peasy. You can park on Almeida Street and the streets behind the restaurant from 6.30pm Pay and Display. Biking? Bike bay just on Napier Street - it couldn't be more convenient! Go on - have an indulgent Monday night out - and keep your wallet happy at the same time.",

    "text": "Cheap French food? \u00a0What? \u00a0Looking for a relatively inexpensive place to eat in Islington, I came across Le Mercury. \u00a0All of their entrees are priced at \u00a37.45, appetizers are a mere \u00a33.95, and the wines and other drinks are more than reasonable (around \u00a33-4 for a glass of wine).I opted for the crispy-skinned sea bass, which came with some really delicious potatoes and pesto. \u00a0It was all perfectly cooked and a perfect portion size for me. \u00a0My friend ordered the steak and he loved it...a rarity for him, since he's usually got something to complain about no matter where he goes!Although we came in quite late without a reservation we were still seated immediately with a quick warning that they were closing in 45 minutes or so...though that didn't end up mattering much at all, since the service was incredibly quick.The atmosphere is a bit romantic-y, with candles and all of that, but it wasn't filled with the kind of gooey lovey couples who might make a night out with a platonic male friend a bit awkward.I just wish I'd tried something from the dessert menu...Oh well. \u00a0Just gives me an excuse to go back!",

    "text": "A romantic candlelit French restaurant which stands out from the crowd on Upper Street - go there with a good looking person to gaze at over candlelight and unwind with a good bottle of French wine. \u00a0The best thing about this place is the value for money compared to other restaurants in the area, a glance at the menu may leave you feeling a little nervous about the cuisine but don't be put off by the almost too modest prices. The food would have been excellent if it had been hotter, but this is a restaurant that's packed almost every night of the week and the highly efficient waiters are rushed off their feet to deliver food to all three floors of the restaurant (you will probably have to book - try to get a table on the ground floor). \u00a0A great place to take someone if you're on a budget - because you won't feel like you are.",

The food is fantastic bistro fare (heavy on duck, pork belly etc), the service wonderfully welcoming, the place is always packed yet i've never failed to get a table without booking, it is astonishingly good value and it is the epitome of a candlelit romantic setting that adapts to every season and it is not far at all from Angel Tube. If I lived in North London, I would be there all the time.",

The moules marinieres are perfect and not rubbery, the duck is always cooked to perfection, the salmon juicy, the lobster ravioli is a winner, and although I've never had it, the pork belly always seems to make my husband very satiated. \u00a0The deserts are nice, but their strengths are their starters and mains. \u00a0The wine list has a fair mix of options, most worth buying by the bottle and none too offensively priced. The last two times I have been there I've been seated upstairs which is more private, but I prefer the seating downstairs for a cafe/french style atmosphere.",

    "text": "Pics@Chopstix2Steakniveschopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 Do you like to be tasked with choosing a place to eat or are you one of those who like to leave it to others?For me, I'm happy either way. These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town.Let's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table.It was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at \u00a33.95We ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.For mains which were all price at \u00a36.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with saut\u00e9ed spinach and lobster sauce.We all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie.",

    "text": "OK I know I'm going against the grain here but bear with me. \u00a0I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with Lucy who raves about it so I had high expectations. A major bonus was the fact that due to volcanic activity (what else?), mutual friend's flight was seriously delayed so we arrived about 45mins after we had the table booked for. \u00a0There was no problem with this, despite the fact that it is nearly always fully-booked so that was great. Lucy noted that the prices had gone up since the last time she'd been, so while still cheap (7.45, specials of the day around 9 or 10 pounds), not as cheap as they used to be. \u00a0My starter was great, my steak was cooked to perfection but not of the highest quality as I was still chewing it over literally 10 minutes after Lucy and friend had finished. Not a good look! The sticky toffee pudding (a passion of mine) was a little dry and not as sticky as it should have been.I thought I'd give it another go for boyfriend's birthday meal as everyone else seems to think it's amazing so I wondered if I'd gone on an off-night. Not so, sadly. \u00a0The maitre d' sat us, a waiter brought over some wine (complementary wine! How thoughtful!) but it wasn't ours and turned out to be the first of many errors of the evening. \u00a0After some time, the maitre d' took our order without writing it down (why do people do this? I've been a waitress and could NEVER remember orders without writing them down - it turns out that this guy couldn't either) so when the starters came, I got the soup I'd ordered, boyfriend got something he didn't. \u00a0It was replaced quickly though and we had complementary bread and butter to keep us going which is a plus. My soup was a disappointment though. French onion is another passion of mine but I make it far better than what I was given - watery, thin, with little flavour. \u00a0Boyfriend's poached pear with blue cheese was lovely though. Some 45 minutes after we had had our starter, I asked where our main courses were and they arrived soon after. I think 45 minutes is a very long time between courses and we were filling up on bread.Anyway, for main I had pork belly which I'd expected to be a slice of meat layered with fat and with a nice chunk of crackling on top. Again, not so. It was a huge lump of tasty pork, not a scrap of crackling to be seen and not enough jus to counteract the dryness of the meat. \u00a0I ended up drinking so much water with it (I can't leave meat, an animal has died for this so I'm not wasting any of it!) that by the end of the meal I was absolutely full to bursting. So much meat and you only get vegetables / chips etc if you order them (1.95 on top) which presented another problem. I ordered a side salad (mixed leaves, 4 slices of cucumber with only the slightest hint of dressing, 1.95 seems very steep for that) while boyfriend ordered chips and a vegetable selection which it seems the maitre d' forgot. \u00a0When we reminded him, we were shortly presented a plate of beans, new potatoes and the oddest carrots which looked like they had been boiled, then left in a low oven for many hours so that all the water had been removed from them. Wrinkled, dehydrated and burnt around the edges. Very strange and not nice to eat! By the end of all that, I wasn't hungry for dessert which is just as well as it took another 20 minutes to get the bill. \u00a0Not bad in that the whole thing was 35.00 for 2 people with a glass of wine and a beer but I wonder if we're all mistaking good value for cheap?Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'm not charmed by Le Mercury.",

I almost don't want to review this place so that people don't flood it, but I want them to continue doing their beautiful thing! We went here after a week in Dijon, where we were sickened by the high prices for relatively little quality. Coming back to London to find this awesome little place was such a contrast. We started off by only wanting main and perhaps dessert, but ended up having wine and all three courses! Every single course was amazing. I recommend this as one of my favourite places in Angel!",
