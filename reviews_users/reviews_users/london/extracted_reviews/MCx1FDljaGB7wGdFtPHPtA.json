I have never had such a good Spanish omlette. I really am not a big omlette fan, but this is really comething special. Get the babaganoush. Bread is complimentary. Also ask for the pimientos de padron. Really tasty. Salty, but for me, they are well seasoned.Just visited here again (27 June 2012) and the waitress/bar tender was really helpful, she went to efforts to explain to me how to make my own babaganoush!Returned again (11 November 2012) I am sorry to say that the same waitress as before was much ruder to me on this occasion. She wouldn't have remembered me, but I remembered her. I was with a younger friend, both students, so we didn't order expensive drinks and so on. A little hard up for cash, she made us feel a little unwelcome. Interesting social experiment really. Have to knock a mark off. Sorry to do it.",

    "text": "I really love Moro and couldn't recommend it more to someone who really enjoys good food. This place is really special and the level of care and detail that goes into the food at Moro is such that only a really mean-spirited person could fail to appreciate it. Their sourdough bread which is baked in their own wood fired oven is the best I've ever had (better than St John's and a world above trendy Poilane) and they even make their own vinegar and yoghurt.The menu is always intriguing and is best described as 'well-executed Iberian and North African peasant food' with only the best ingredients. I have eaten there 4 times and had things ranging from wood-fire grilled mutton chop to grilled quail with freekah (like a kind of green, roasted wheat) and the spicing and flavours are always delicious and mouthwatering. The desserts are equally delicious ranging from a cheese course of small, farmhouse Spanish cheeses to delicate almond cakes with orange blossom and creme fraiche.The only negative thing I can say about Moro is that it is probably a victim of its own success and patronised by a lot of people who probably don't really know (or care) what they are eating which makes for a slightly obnoxious and loud (as someone else commented) ambiance. I suspect that this is why the staff can be a little blunt and curt at times but they certainly aren't incompetent. If like me you don't really go out to be pandered to by restaurant staff and are happy so long as you get the food you ordered within a reasonable amount of time then you really shouldn't have any problems here. Do go - it really is wonderful and delicious!",

    "text": "Being a vegetarian in London is easy. No matter where you go, from Michelin-starred restaurant to run-down pub, there are always options for you. So when I sat down and looked at the menu at Moro, my heart sank a little. There was only one veggie option for lunch, and it was a \u00a314.50 mezze plate. Everything else, despite being non-vegetarian, looked good! I was disappointed, but resigned to my fate. The disappointment didn't last long after that huge plate was set before me. On it were two pieces of crispy flatbread and an assortment of some of the best houmous and roasted vegetables I've ever had. It's been a few weeks since I went there, so I can't remember all the details, just that there were about five or six small salads and dips to spread on my bread and they all tasted very good. One side contained some of the most delicate pomegranate seeds I've ever eaten. The only down-side to this restaurant is that it is so loud. Even though my friends and I were seated near the door, it was so loud in there that we couldn't hear each other talking. For that, I dock Moro one star.",

    "text": "We ate here last night for our wedding anniversary after it was recommended by one of our very good friends as probably his favourite restaurant in London right now. As a private member of The Ivy and Soho House to name a few for this to be one of his favourite places to eat meant it had to be good.And boy was it. We made the booking about two weeks ago and was told that the only available time for a sitting would be 6:30-9pm which suited us fine with our working commitments.On arrival we were greeted by some very friendly staff and shown to our table. The instant we sat down and took in the vibe it became apparent how very relaxed and almost bohemian it was. Very Mediterranean indeed.Bread was promptly brought to our table and we kick started the night off with one of their home made lemonades. As its home made you get the choice of fizzy or still, sweet or bitter. We chose fizzy and a bit in the middle for sourness and what we received was heaven in a chalice. I would highly recommend having one.Onto the menu and although I had already perused the menu on their website and sort of made my mind up I was still very open minded. Luckily I was as due to them changing the menu daily there was loads of different items to chose from.For starters my wife went for the pumpkin and labneh fatayer with pine nuts and cinnamon which was a kind of folded bread parcel with mashed pumpkin, pine nuts and cinnamon inside. I only tried a few mouthfuls but the flavours were awesome with the cinnamon dancing around your palette long after you had finished your mouthful. A very well put together dish. I went for the pan fried morcilla, caramelised apple and watercress salad. This was sublime to say the least. The sweetness of the apple combined with the earthiness of the Spanish black pudding left my mouth tingling. Both portion sizes where just right.The wine of choice for our starters was recommended by one of our very knowledgeable waiters. After trying a few we decided to go for the Pittacum which was a very light fresh fruity red which came chilled. As the wine slowly warmed the flavours developed and perhaps even intensified complimenting our starters perfectly.The mains menu proved to be a bit of a challenge for me as out of about eight dishes I wanted to try at least seven of them. Instead I was made to choose one and I wisely chose the wood smoked grouse with panceta migas and caramelised figs. On ordering it I was informed that it was served pink and may contain shot. Well grouse should be served pink and being a wild bird I would question any who had not met its end via a shotgun. Once again the flavours of the ingredients combined perfectly to give this dish je ne sais quoi. With the grouse season being a little slower this year do to a wet spring if its on the menu it should be sampled. This was echoed on many of the other tables and appeared to be a very popular choice last night and rightly so. My wife went for grilled lamb with warm feta and pink fir apple potato salad and tomato, caper and olive salsa. The lamb was served pink and melted in the mouth while the combination of the other flavours was like a firework going off in your mouth. I only had the pleasure of a few mouthfuls as my wife enjoyed it so much I didn't get offered any more than that.The wine we chose for our mains was a Senoiro Amezola, Reserva which was a gorgeous Rioja that once again accompanied our mains perfectly. So perfectly in fact we had two bottles of it.For desert we decided to share ordering rosewater and cardamom ice cream and a yoghurt cake with pistachios and pomegranate. Both of these deserts we're absolutely divine. The flavour of the ice cream was out of this world and the texture of the yoghurt cake just outstanding.At around 8:50pm we were asked if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar area as our table was needed for the next sitting. As we had been talking to the couple sitting at the next to us we asked if there was room for all four of us at the bar. Unfortunately there was not but as cancellation had just come up we were shown to a table of four where we finished the wine over a selection of cheeses and and a freshly made cracker.Every table for both sittings was booked which for a Monday night tells you something. The prices were extremely reasonable we felt for the level of service and the divine food we had the pleasure of eating.I would highly recommend this to anyone able to get a booking?Happy eating London",

I always manage to try something that I have never had before, last time trying fried chick peas (I would recommend). The service is excellent, the staff all know the menu very well and are happy to chat you through options and recommend if you wish. I also like the relaxed feel that they work hard to maintain, which means that eating here feels luxurious and not rushed. The rosewater and cardamom ice cream is a personal favourite of mine, but it is difficult to recommend meals as they are different each time I go. It is worth booking if in a party or at a busy time, but they are usually really helpful when trying to squeeze people in when you have forgotten to book, or are popping in just in case.",

I googled the location and my friend, who lives in South Kensington, was like - where the f--'s that?! Moro isn't necessarily in the poshest part of London, but the trip was well worth it. \u00a0We had to take the tube across town and walk a few blocks to get to the place.When we got in - we stupidly hadn't made reservations, and the Maitre d' (his name was Hugo) was a total ass. \u00a0If fate hadn't intervened, we may not have ate at Moro that night. \u00a0Hugo told us he had a table for us immediately but we would have to finish within an hour, or we could sit at the bar and wait until after 9:30 pm (we had arrived around 7pm).Incensed, my friend tried to start a fight with Hugo while I played the \"I'm so sorry this man is acting this way\" card. \u00a0Hugo wasn't having it, and we sat at the bar for about an hour and a half. \u00a0In that time we finished two bottles of champagne on empty stomachs and made friends with every other waiter, patron, and bar tender around us. \u00a0After my friend and Hugo engaged in some nasty staring contests, and after I pleaded with Hugo for a fourth or fifth time, he gave in. \u00a0During the entire time there were definitely tables that sat empty for long periods of time until Hugo filled them - I think he was just a jerk.The food was well worth it. \u00a0I was excited to see food that was completely reminiscent of the cookbooks, as was the atmosphere of the restaurant. \u00a0The design is very \"marrakesh meets barcelona\" with hard wood, bright blues, tiles, gem tones, you name it. \u00a0The bathrooms are exceptionally cute.I don't remember exactly what we ate - something that had pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, couscous, and meat. \u00a0But it was delicious. \u00a0We had an olive oil cake for dinner - not sweet at all, but I loved it.I couldn't have been happier finally eating at Moro. \u00a0If I do move to London in the future I will make it out to Moro at least once every month or so.",

What makes it so isn't that the raw ingredients cost so little, but the 'extras' that add the value - great service, ambience, something 'special'- simply aren't always there. We ate at the bar - and the barman was polite enough, although dispensed drink and food with all the charm and warmth of a mortician; ie someone who's not too bothered about customer experience. The best, best thing about Moro is the yoghurt cake, which is delicious; chips of pistachio nuts, pomegranate seeds; wonderful.

As for the decor it needs ripping out and starting again, the walls are lumpy and badly painted, with the money they are making they should be able to afford to do that.To summarize your spending lots of money in a noisy, trashy looking place, but a lot of people do it, so something must be right.",

The restaurant is cosy yet fashionable and has a quite rustic feel. The exposed kitchen at the back of the restaurant isn't intrusive and adds to the atmosphere. Our table was situated at the back and tucked around a corner, there was heaps of natural light from the skylight which was unusual in this normally quite dark restaurant. We had some bread and mezze to start. The bread is absolutely amazing all hand made on site and when dipped in fantastic oils and salt and pepper, truly divine. I tried some of the mezze bits and pieces which included a spectacular Spanish omlette type thing. For starter I had broad beans with coriander and cous cous. It was really light and a nice fresh course to start the proper eating with. For main I had the whole Bream. The fish tasted fantastic and, on the whole, every bit of delicious white meat slid off the bones. The beetroot condiment that accompanied it was also really good and the bright green (coriander) sauce was also a big hit. For desert I tried the legendary pistachio and yogurt cake, kind of like a weird cross between a cheesecake and a mushy mess. It did, of course, taste amazing. I also tried some of the Alfonso mango which was unlike any other mango I've ever tasted. Top notch!!! All the wine we had was excellent, it's all Spanish and really tasty. Thank god someone else was picking up the bill - this place isn't cheap, but well worth the money. A fantastic restaurant, unpretentious and committed to serving amazing food. Book early - this place is going to be full - especially as it's just won the Observer Food Awards Restaurant of the Year. And well deserved too. Five stars!!!",

Two courses barely touch the sides. Although the flavours are excellent, my squid starter was absolutely over-cooked. That's unforgivable when small piece with a bit of rocket salad comes in at \u00a38.50. The main course was tiny. You know when you have to slow down to a virtual stop just so you don't clear your plate in two minutes? That's what you'll need to do here. Service could do with being less snooty, although it was perfectly efficient. Won't be returning as it's quite simply overpriced - the food is good, but they need to be more generous with the portions and accept they aren't quite a fine dining establishment (nor would people want them to be).",

With a long \"tapas\" bar stretching from the door, funky music, and an audible buzz - Moro feels trendy from the get-go; the kitchen, however, also seems to put considerable emphasis on fresh ingredients and delicious pairings. Loin of Lamb, served with an Okra/Chickpea Ratatouille was fantastic - and I heard similar exclamations/nods of approval from those around me, who were devouring everything from deep fried snails, to pork belly, to a sumptuous looking crab ragout on toast. Service was quick and friendly... no complaints here.Moro boasts a deep, Iberian-concentrated wine list - and a huge selection of sweet and dry sherries. If just looking for a nibble, there are a dozen smaller dishes available to eat at the bar.",

I was a little suprised to see that this wasn't just tapas, actually, for me it was a little more Turkish than anything else. This was however, damn tasty. It was tittering on a 5 star experience. I mean, the poor waitress had to put up with a barrage of questions about the menu from me so you can see why she was a little surly. The food, was wonderful. And if you are a wine fun, then this is a must in London. Their wine list is longer than the last Harry Potter book and you can even get a selection of dessert wines to sample. The crowd here are older though, not really with families but well established couples and older groups of friends. It all adds to the mature grown-up vibe I get from this place. It also has a nice selection of out door seats. Just perfect for dinner on a warm summers day.",

No, that's full too. This process went on for a while and eventually I found myself booking a table for two weeks in the future. When the day finally came round I wasn't sure if I was in the mood for Mediterranean/ North African fare, maybe I'd just like a bag of chips from the shop instead? How stupid I was. This was one of the best meals I've ever had and I would wait months if that was what it took to get another table here. To start we shared a Harissa Squid Salad. This was no chewy calamari affair rather a sweet, smokey delicious piece of well cooked seafood. I loved it. Our mains were equally delicious especially my Lamb with Chickpea puree. As these dishes demonstrate the menu is very creative and applies spices and techniques more readily associated with Morocco to ingredients from the Med. Cooking this clever doesn't come cheap and our meal for two cost around \u00a370. However, everything from the service to the wine was so perfect I have nothing to fault Moro for. If you're on a tighter budget I've heard that their bar tapas menu is also great. Highly recommended!",

And last night, on London's most warm and glorious evening of the year, I finally sampled what all the Moro fuss is about. The Fuss:The ambiance helps... the food is as beautiful as the venue is as beautiful as the servers is as beautiful as the sun setting on Exmouth Market, revealing almost a Greek-like pleasure-filled, bustling alleyway. Not a bad way to dine, eh? The fresh bread immediately comes chunky, fluffy and freshly floured. The vegetarian mezze was a colourful splattering of various Spanish bits, and the fish and lamb were both perfectly charred outside and pink in the middle. All very very good things. But it's the wine that really stood out to me. The menu was so robust that it even came with training wheels - a numbering system for those who don't know much about the grape escape. I ended the evening with a dessert flight that blew me away. Sure it's pricey. Sure it's been a buzzing hot spot for 12 years. Sure it's busy and sometimes that 'we're the shizz and we know it' attitude can come through the phone reservation people. (I tried to reserve and dine three previous dates before getting seated tonight.) But there is certainly a rational reason behind all of those things. Don't go for a humble bargain - go for an experience of opulent deliciousness. So without any shame in my pun, gimme some Moro!",

Great wine list, mostly Spanish. Big range of prices, helpful descriptive numbering system and very good wine for reasonable prices. 4. Fantastic dense, chewy sourdough bread and olive oil for every table. 5. Friendly, funny, easygoing server who helped us wade through the menu and gave helpful, sincere suggestions on how to maximize menu enjoyment while still saving room for dessert. 6. The aubergine and yogurt salad/dip/plate of amazing with crispy lamb and little pita cracker bites of crunch. Smooth, velvety, toasty, wow. 7. The pork with green churrasco sauce. Fatty melt-in-your-mouth perfection. 8. The lamb. Pink and phenomenal. 9. The dessert. This famous yogurt cake looks like baby vomit on a plate. It is also one of the best desserts I have ever had. Apparently ours was the 'last of the cake' so it didn't quite have the form that the others have, and so they gave it to us on the house. My friend licked the plate clean. I'm not even kidding.10. We bought two cookbooks. That should tell you how good the food was and how much we wanted the experience to continue. A week later and I've already made three dishes from it.

I had been looking forward to dining here for some time, having enjoyed reading Nigel Slater's review in the Oberver Food Monthly. The whole experience however, was underwhelming, and very disappointing. I asked myself: How could such a restaurant garner such incredible reviews?The restaurant was pretty full and there are a lot of tables so I felt a little cramped, especially with the large coat stand towering over me, which seems to swamp the dining room.Starters of Braised chard and Jamon and Artichoke Soup were ok, but actually getting someone to serve us was proving to be difficult. Main courses of Chicken and Lamb were reasonably tasty, but my aubergine was incredibly over seasoned.At which point a table towards the bar was becoming increasingly rowdy, men were arguing, and when a member of staff asked them to quieten down, they looked prepared for a fight!Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I left with a feeling that this restaurant is horribly overhyped. I've had better food in local pubs, let alone other restaurants in similar price bracket to Moro. Why is it that Guardian reading Islington types love it so much? \u00a0Can someone please tell me?",

Top tip is that you can extend your menu choice by ordering startes or deserts from the main menu if you ask nicely!! House wine went down very well at \u00a314 and they have a great choice of sherry. Chorizo salad with beans was sublime. Tortilla was firm, moist and full of flavour. Plenty of bread on the bar with good olive oil!! Cheese to finish was a great selection and had been treated well. 9/10 Great food, wine and an excellent place to watch the world go by.",

I'm coming down with the lurgy and he's just getting over it, so the bottle of wine and heaps of tapas that I envisioned us consuming did not happen. Instead we had a quiet, somewhat leisurely but mostly sober Saturday afternoon lunch. I had a whole sea bream with cauliflower and chick pea side which was fantastic and the bf had lamb. My starter of salt cod with roasted red peppers was fantastic and my one glass of dry but fruity white was easy to drink. I would go back in a heartbeat when I am feeling better and I'm picking up one of their cookbooks soon - if that's any indication of how I feel about the place.",

    "text": "I have been avoiding writing a review of Moro because it can't say what I want it to say. I want to say the food was thrilling. I want to say it was inventive, brilliant, complex. I want to revel in its neighbourhood vibe and its relaxed ambiance. Unfortunately it turned out to be another over hyped restaurant. I have wanted to go to Moro forever. I have never been organised enough to book. I will ring up on a Monday and ask for a table for two that night, they will say how about next week. This has been going on for years and is a testament to their popularity. I finally went the other week for a big meet the parents meal. The vibe is nice, buzzy and interested. The waiters were, given how stuffed the restaurant was, understandably busy. The forgetfulness was fine, the edge of rudeness or just get on with it was not. What I was excited about was the food. This is what Moro is about. Unfortunately what it was was pairings which didn't work, or where one sauce overpowered another. For instance my fish was completely overpowered by an aioli which I spent the first couple of minutes removing like a contagion. The other dishes were fine, not quite there, with an ingredient or taste that normally didn't quite fit. I wouldn't say the meal was bad and the bread for a starter was great. It was just distinctly underwhelming and the thing about Moro is that for all its friendly chummy neighbourhood vibe it is charging premium prices. For that it should be better.",

Service was poor; albeit the waitress was polite, they gave us wrong wines twice (which they charged us double for) and did not know the english translation of the dishes on the menu. Not just overpriced but down right bad. Surprised by how others rated this place - only explanation has to be the menu varying per season. I would advise to go only if you have to but do not initiate it yourself.Bread - probably the best part of the meal. The bread was fresh and of good quality. Served with decent olive oil and salt/pepper seasoningKale salad (starter) - tiny portion of weirdly seasoned kale, served with a fresh but odd tasting cheese (avoid)Chicharr\u00f3n with hummus (starter) - nothing special. Taste was plain, deep fried tiny portion served on a bed of humus (edible but not good)Plaice (main) - this was good. Vegetables accompanying the fish were very tasty (mainly tomato, parsley and cucumber) and the fish seemed fresh (be careful of the bones but otherwise order)",

Apparently they only sell the tapas menu if you sit at the bar, but it was so not crowded that they let us order tapas from a table.The waiter recommended around 3-5 tapas per person, but we ended up getting 5 total for both of us: chicken wings, patatas bravas, baba ganoush, grilled chorizos, and mojama with peppers. They were all good! The patatas had the most generous portion, with a (small) plate overflowing with potato cubes. The grilled chicken wings turned out to be 2 wings and 2 drumsticks, which was perfect.The cardamom ice cream and the raisin ice cream we ordered for dessert were both very exotic, in a good way.Ended up being around \u00a322 per person for lunch - a bit too pricey for me to frequent, so maybe I'll try their stall in the market next time :)",

The wild boar pork bely was fantastic, perfectly cooked and the potatoes that went alongside it were some that I wish I could eat every day - so so nice!They had a good selection of craft beers and wine, I was tempted by the sherry flights they also do but couldn't really pair it up with my choice of dessert so decided to hold on for a beer at the next bar.

    "text": "I had been waiting to try Moro having heard so much about it. We went on a Friday for lunch and it was a rare beautiful sunny day in London. The restaurant was very handsome and I very much appreciated the spare decor by thinking they would instead highlight the food. The ambience and crowd seemed just right and we were primed for a great dining experience. Unfortunately that didn't happen and we left disappointed. For our appetizer we shared the grilled Octopus with chick pea puree - that was outstanding but it was all downhill from there. The Branzino I had was under-seasoned and there was really nothing tasty about it. It was \u00a0cooked perfectly but peculiarly under-seasoned for a restaurant that specializes in Moorish/Spanish/Turkish food. There was no subtlety to the seasonings - it just wasn't tasty. My friend had the wood roasted chicken which was good but on the dry side. Again, nothing to write home about. The most disappointing by far was the dessert. We got the chocolate ganache cake with yogurt. I thought they meant the cake was made with yogurt which sounded intriguing. But it was a slice of rich chocolate cake with a few spoons of plain yogurt for a sauce next to it. The idea was to mix the plain, slightly sour yogurt with the chocolate cake. We were told the yogurt was house -made but the juxtapositioning \u00a0of the 2 was completely off. Who thought this would be a good pairing? Overall, nothing to recommend here except the bread they serve initially with some great olive oil and the grilled octopus. Would not return.",

    "text": "My friend organized her birthday dinner here last weekend, and while I have been to its little sister Morito next door, I have never made it to the original, legendary Moro. I'd always thought of it as posh fine dining, but I think I was quite wrong - it's not even white tablecloth. We had a table off to the back and shared the room with just one other group, which was a very nice touch for a special occasion dinner. The vibe feels similar to that of Social Eating House - it's happening, it's busy, it's not over the top posh or formal, but the food is incredible.I ordered the seared venison as a starter and the charcoal grilled lamb as a main. Normally I would have thought the two would be a bit heavy in combination, but they were by far the ones that called to me. The meat was incredibly flavourful without being too rich. I especially liked the dried pepper salsa that came with the lamb, and it was a great pairing that differentiated the meat from a roast that you can get anywhere else. I'd definitely come again for a solid, hearty meal that looks great and doesn't break the bank.",

    "text": "Moro is one of those places I've wanted to eat at for ages but haven't because I don't like having to reserve ages in advance so fortunately we were able to get a table for 9pm on a Friday evening with only a few days notice.It was great. Inside it's buzzing with a simple, open layout and open kitchen at the end. A long bar extends the entire length of the restaurant (taps menu only available at the bar).Ordered the mushrooms on toast for starter which was excellent. Simple and with balanced flavours. They could have given the dish a fancy name with some unfamiliar funghi name on \u00a0char grilled crispy sourdough bread with olive oil from some single estate in Spain (which it all may well have been) but credit to them that they just called it 'mushrooms on toast'. Sometimes pretentious menu descriptions fail to deliver when the actual dish shows up but in this case it was the other way round.For mains I ordered chargrilled lamb with rice and some beetroot based sauce. That wasn't the actual menu description but just my memory of what I ate. The waitress mentioned the lamb would be served pink and was that OK. Yes, no problem. This dish was just delicious. A generous serving of yes, very pink lamb slices on a bed of rice and some other grains which had been slow cooked with spices and something else which just made it great and a cold beetroot based \u00a0sauce over the top. Back to the lamb. It wasn't rare in the normal sense yet tender and flavourful. Perhaps it was cooked sous vide and then finished on the chargrill....However they did it, it was just excellent.For desert I opted for the Malaga raisin ice cream. So simple again and so good. What made it was the glass of sherry poured over with some giant raisins which may also have been sherry soaked. Yum.Service was efficient and food arrived pronto, yet no feeling of time pressure at all even though tables were turning around us with only minutes between the next diners being seated.I'm looking forward to going back.",

The best of the best were the fish and vegetable dishes. Specifically, the seared mackerel with rhubarb/tarragon/walnut salad was amazing - even my husband who doesn't like either mackerel or rhubarb, loved this dish. \u00a0He had the broad bean soup twice. \u00a0Two other starters not to be missed are the quail and the asparagus/oyster mushroom/jamon. \u00a0The sea bass main course was our favorite entree mostly because of the braised fennel, baked feta and salad of orange and pea salad that came with it - perfection. The Spanish wines recommended paired with the food were also excellent. Usually we are all about the food and not overly focused on the service but at Moro, the staff was not only good at their jobs but genuinely hospitable, even recognizing us on our second and third visits and welcoming us back. Finally, I can't thank Emma and her kitchen colleagues (including Sam) for taking such good care of us and answering my many questions about the preparation of their dishes. Their generosity enhanced our flavor filled dining experiences even more. Thanks Moro!",

I've also bought the books and made some wonderful food but the core product, the restaurant, always disappoints. Firstly, whats with the menu? With all those exciting recipes in their three cookbooks the menu barely changes especially the main courses which heavily rely on the wood fired oven which tends to be a bit like russian roulette with the doneness of the meat. I have had overdone chicken and underdone pork. The more interesting tapas menu is only available if you eat at the bar which seems crazy even if you're spend is the same. Staff are a mixed back of eager and helpful with laid back and inattentive.Morito next door is more interesting and has a more varied menu.",

There are lots of plus points - a lively atmosphere, good Spanish focused wine list and engaging knowledgeable staff. However, I feel a little too crammed in, to the point that navigating through the tables means knocking into other diners.The food is also a bit hit and miss. From the starters we chose baby onions on toast with cecina and gamba y patatas alinadas. \u00a0The former was delicious with caramelised onions and tender beef (albeit on slightly burnt toast). \u00a0The later was something of a disappointment with the predominant flavour being slightly vinegary onions. \u00a0Not good!From the main courses, we ordered from the wood oven. The lamb (ordered medium and served, at best, medium to well done) was tasty although some of the accompanying vegetables got slightly lost. For example, a date and parsnip salad seemed conspicuously absent of date. The wood pigeon was better - partially deboned which made it easy to eat and pleasant on the eye with excellent crispy skin. To finish, we enjoyed the Malaga raisin ice cream featuring giant raisins and a lovely silky texture and Moro's stellar Chocolate and Apricot Tart never fails to deliver. The pastry is super thin and crunchy. The apricot gives a good glug of flavour and the chocolate is a soft, almost souffle like topping.It almost makes me forget all that went before. However, weaving your way through the crowd brings it all back. Just far too annoying for a restaurant with these prices. I am sure I will be back, perhaps sitting outside at lunch on a Summer's day. However moving forwards I expect it's little neighbour, Morito, will get more of its business - more fun, better value and no need to make reservations.",
