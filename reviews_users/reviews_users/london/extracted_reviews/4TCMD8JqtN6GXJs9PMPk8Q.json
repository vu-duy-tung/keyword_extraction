Honestly, I'd prefer Ajisen (which is also an international chain) and some of the local ramen shops out in Southern California. Still, it was a pretty decent treat for a cold winter's night.",

The staff are friendly and although I know they have to ask if you have been to a Wagamamas before, I'm convinced they mean it. The service is quick but never pushy and the food is consistent. As it is a stone's throw away from a lot of night hot spots, Wagamama's Camden is a good place to start a night out with friends. My vegetarian friend finds options for her are good. It's even better when you love seafood! For a no-fuss, quick and tasty meal in Camden, I would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Nicely set back from the main drag of Camden High Street, this branch of Wagamamas is great for avoiding the greasy pizza slices and questionable Chinese food available elsewhere in the area, though if you want more choice the newly refurbished Stables Market is the place to go these days. I find Wagamamas one of the least offensive chains though, with its welcoming staff, efficient service and healthgiving food. One of their spicy coconut milk noodle soups was just the ticket for a sickly me the other night, even though I still haven't found a way of eating them decorously. Thankfully my dinner buddy didn't mind me splashing soup on the table with the giant paddle spoon!",

If you go to their website you can get some discount vouchers at certain times of the year like a two for one or a free drink with your meal.I came here with a group of 10 for my birthday last year and we had a great time and got a discount off our order.",

Sure, it's OK, but it's a tad over-priced for the generic 'eat and get out' vibe that most of the restaurants tend to project. For the same price, you could go to a rather nice Asian restaurant with better service and a higher quality of food.Wagamama is a reliable restaurant, sure, predictable and tasty, but it's a bit too generic for my liking. Go if you're craving an Asian feed, but can't find (or be bothered finding) anything else close by.",

Nothing wrong with the quality however, and their choices are relatively wide and the ingredients are fresh, but it's not the best I've had. I still can quite justify ordering one of their ramens however, as I associate that with packaged ramen noodles (which I do love) which I always used to associate with very simple snack food back in Asia. What they do do well is the fried ginger chicken udon with garlic, lemongrass and mange tout. Their rice dishes are also worth a try.",

    "text": "We love this Wags in Camden as it's slightly hidden and not as manic as some of the other central London branches. Service here is always good and your food is served within minutes, plus the prices are kind on the wallet. For a Coeliac or anyone else who has to dine gluten free it's a mixed bag. Very little on the menu is gluten free e.g. most starters contain gluten (often due to soy sauce marinades or how they are cooked). However, if you can ascertain what ingredient makes the starter a no go often they'll serve it minus that for you eg the Yakitori chicken skewers minus the sauce. Not quite the same but a good compromise. They seem happy for you to bring your own Gluten Free soy sauce so a little forward planning never goes amiss. They do have an allergen folder so you can discover which dishes are GF. Most of the noodle dishes are a no-go, plus some other mains are off the menu for Coeliacs due to how they are cooked (cross contamination). Our favourite is the gluten free coconut soup. Each Wags is a franchise so always ask to see their allergy menu. We've found they vary. There is limited choices for Coeliacs and occassional errors so it's not great for Coeliac Newbies. Don't expect the staff to have a great gluten free understanding or to be factually correct as we came across allergy options for Coeliacs that did include and had to write to Head Office to get them amended. Our top tip is: order unlimited green tea with all main courses. It's lovely and you'll feel very pure for not diving into alcoholic drinks. Sadly there is no GF beer on offer here. Yet Wags is a great pit stop for cheap healthy food on the go with friends. This branch is one our favourites a it is so Central and easy to get to whilst being spacious inside. Go because there's very few places you can eat Asian style gluten free food (apart from Thai). So if you're craving a fix this is well worth a trip. Prepare: to do your homework online first and then quizz the waiters well when there to avoid being glutened.",

They also do lovely fresh soups, freshly squeezed juices, and the most amazing desserts including ginger, toffee cheesemake which actually melts in the mouth.

The staff at this branch are great - the other day my friend suddenly fet really ill while we were eating (not from the food!) and the staff were really great at helping us look after her and order a taxi.

The dishes are big and tasty.Not the place to take someone out on a romantic date but for a quick lunch / dinner it's the perfect solution.Service is usually good and the food comes fast.This place is about a block of Camden High Street so it's not as busy as most of the places around the area. We visited it on a Saturday afternoon when Camden is packed but the restaurant was half empty!",

    "text": "Ok, I'm a creature of habit but Wagamama does a handful of menu items really well....For example, I always get the Firecracker meal in either chicken or prawn. \u00a0Or their Warm Chicken Cashew salad and Nicoise tuna salad are great. \u00a0The juices are delicious too. \u00a0But the appetizers I find to be too small for what you pay for and I've had another salad that was anything but filling. \u00a0So, if you stick to your favorites, Wagamama is a winner. \u00a0But deviating may leave you disappointed with portion sizes. \u00a0Service is always friendly, so that's good. \u00a0A good option for a lunch!",

    "text": "Wagamama has such a strong formula that it doesn't seem to matter which one you go to. However this was better than the average version. It's bright, light and airy. We went on a Wednesday lunchtime and it was very quiet. The service was very good - attentive until they realised that we were waiting for someone, then they completely left us alone until we asked them to come over.Very nice staff, great lunch that we spent almost three hours over (mainly waiting for our fourth guest!) and soooo cheap!",

    "text": "Wagamama was formerly one of my favorite restaurant chains in London. Then, I started noticing that the plate portions were reduced and dishes were hardly filling. I typically would order the chicken katsu curry, which does get two stars for flavor and appetizing menu selection. But, the last time I ordered this dish, I was disappointed when a mound of sticky white rice was covering the cheap portion of fried chicken strips with a limp salad to top it all off. I felt skimped for sure and decided that I would no longer be a customer of this chain. The end!",

And it's not that I'm (much of a ) Japanese food snob, I promise.Even without expecting authentic Japanese dishes, Wagamama fails to deliver anything positive for me to latch onto. The noodles in the ramen are oddly mushy, listless lumps. The katsu curry is tasteless and fatty. Even they gyoza isn't good.I never knew bad gyoza was possible...The staff is nice enough and the bathrooms were nice. Which is something, I suppose. I would recommend this place for large groups of people who need to meet in an easy to find restaurant. Or to people who have low expectations.",

If you're like me, you'll have 2-3 favourite dishes that you know you can fall back on when not feeling adventurous. Normally it's No43, Amai Udon, for me. Yums!The seating is canteen style, so it's perfect for a group of you. If it's just the two of you, its the quick lunch or informal supper you need.The green tea is free and healthy and their specials are usually worth considering too. This review will suffice for all Wagamamas branches because they're mostly exactly the same! But I do like this Camden one, it's off the main road so the tourists don't usually find it.",
