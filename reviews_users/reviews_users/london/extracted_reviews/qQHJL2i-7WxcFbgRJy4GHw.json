    "text": "Located right outside Camden Town station, Woody Grill is a convenient place to grab a quick bite to eat. I picked up a falafel for takeaway and it was thoroughly enjoyable. The service is quick, as they prepare your food right in front of you. Not exactly friendly, the staff treat customers with a weariness borne of regularly serving post-pub Camdeners, but they expertly prepared my falafel and had me on my way in less than five minutes. I appreciate a good falafel and if I ever choose to eat in, the seating looks clean and inviting.",

That's how good it is. Lamb shish is also really really good, love their chilli and garlic sauce. Much better than the average kebab shop.",

Quite and easy to order - they do have seats but sort of place you want a takeaway and it's always busy so that's good sign. First time I had meat and chips which was just what I needed but the second time I had a lamb wrap which was mouth watering delicious with a selection of salad and chilli's I will be back to try something new ...",

I have been aware of some of the other branches of Woody Grill around town, but as yet I had never tried any of them.Thank goodness that the owner(s) of Woody Grill saw the gap in the market for this type of food, delivered in this way! Top quality kebab ingredients put together with fresh salads, tasty (and, by my reckoning, not too laden with artificial flavourings and colourings) with quality wraps and breads.The big difference to the flavour is the type of wood charcoal that they burn under the grills that really adds to the taste of the meat that they cook here. All of the pieces of meat I had were full of flavour, and satisfyingly juicy. The only thing I had to be aware of was not to get their delicious sauce run out of the wrap down my arm to my elbow!A real treat. I cannot wait for another opportunity to give the Woody Grill, another visit!",

I'm used to humidity during the end of spring. Kinda hard to find a perfect blend of spring weather now a days. All I had packed was a cardi and a leather. Anyway some kid that I met at a Caribbean joint near my hotel decided he didn't want the food ordered from the spot I met him at. I had scarfed down my food. I paid for it so it will be eaten. I wasn't really hungry when he invited me out to this joint. I caved and decided to go and get something light. The pita was nice and warm. Just delightful. The orange juice was fresh and tasty. I really loved the falafel though! It was so delicious! Nice and hot on such a cold night. My only problem was that they had the doors opened. Why? It's -10 degrees out, seriously... They probably wanted us out. We didn't leave until 3 or 4am. I was pooped.",

    "text": "With so many take-away's in the area Woody's has a lot of competition. However the bright interior and food options, do call to me... I also love the salad they give you, it's so crisp, it makes the wrap and that's important to me!Prices are reasonable and I find the falafel moister than King of Falafel across the road. The shish's are on the more expensive side, but they make them quite quickly and the meat is pretty juicy.A recommendation is to eat in the restaurant (if it's not late they are usually open), the bread is much better, you get some better sauces and accompaniments, and it's nice to have a more relaxed meal. Also the price isn't much more than the take-away.Although I really didn't like the iskender when I recently visited, which was Lamb donner style rather than shish. I love this dish usually, but in the future would avoid it here.",

    "text": "Woody Grill was recommended to me by my professor and it's one of her favorite places to eat in Camden! My professor definitely knows her food and I trust her taste so of course I thought to check it out myself. There is a very comfortable environment in Woody Grill that is great for conversing with friends over a meal. The service was relatively fast and the portion sizes were large and definitely worth the money spent (each person spent about 10 pounds and left full and satisfied). Additionally, grilled flatbread with hummus (appetizer) and Turkish delight (dessert) were complementary as we waited for our food to be prepared and as we were about to leave. I ordered a lamb doner plate and it was nicely presented with a generous serving of lamb doner over rice and a side salad---it was delicious and I would definitely recommend! Overall, great dining experience with great food.",

Lebanese food does have lots of veggie options. Sadly they don't feature much on the menu which is why I subtracted a star. Update 16/3: had a quick combo falafel/hallumi wrap which was tasty and filling and not expensive. A win/win in the increasingly expensive Camden area",

The food is SOOOO good that it's always very hard for me to resist that additional bite (well should I say bites) after I am already full. The small restaurant just to the site is a fantastic idea. Very useful if you are with a friend/friends and looking for a quick bite to eat. And their sharing platter is always the way to go....there is enough food on it to feed an army :) It will definitely make you to unleash your inner carnivore!!!! However I am also a big fan of their falafel.",

Good arouma too, but it's really tasty food so there is not much more I can say. Classy place.",

Mediocre food at best!The service is terrible- no smiles and you have to flag the waitresses down each time for anything.The food was equally bad- rice was not cooked fully, garlic sauce was sour, meat was tasteless and weird foreign objects coming out of the lamb shwarma!Don't even bother ordering the Ayran yogurt drink that they have their name on- no salt at all- bland and gross. Won't go back!",

    "text": "Based on the takeaway service I would give this place 5*. Excellent wraps and swift service. I did however recently pop in for lunch and had a sit down service which was shabby to say the least. As with most Turkish restaurants in London your brought over warm bread and a small array of mixed salad, garlic and Chilli sauce. I noticed a guy was just finishing up and pay when we arrived and the waitress was clearing his table. Thinking no one was looking, she collected the leftovers from the basket of bread along with dips and brought them round to the serving area round the other side which I thought was strange as you could see her taking the dirty plates down stairs which I assumed to be cleaned. I decided investigate and went round the corner to the serving area only to see a different waitress putting the left over bread back on the hot stone to re-heat and serve to another unsuspecting customer! They where just topping up the dips with more sauce and giving to the next person though the doors without a thought for hygiene or the fact that that stuff had been from table to table person to person. This was a firm favourite of mine but having seen this has really put me off going there. I guess if your eating a wrap takeaway there isn't much for them to do with that and its prepared in front of you.",

They have a good amount of food on the menu and i decided to get the lamb and fries. I wasn't exactly sure how it came, but i figured it couldn't be that bad. They serve it as lamb over fries, literally. They put fries in a tray (if you ask for it to go) and put a whole bunch of freshly sliced lamb on top with chili sauce and white sauce, and if you want veges you can get that stuff. One thing you will notice though is that they give you a TON of food. Being from NYC, I know a little bit (read A LOT) about delicious halal food and this place is pretty darn good and pretty good bang for your buck. Stop in if your in the area.",
