While you wait by the bar, they have a selection of interesting juices to choose from. And I learned a new fact - you can't drink straight beet juice because it won't agree with your insides. Who knew? Glad they had the facts.I really enjoyed my sweet potato and cashew curry. Yum, yum. Very filling and comfort-food-esque. I also enjoyed their big chocolately dessert. Gluten-free notes: This place goes out of their way to help non-vegetarian people with food restrictions. They identify wheat-free and gluten-free items on the menu, and there's plenty for you to choose from.",

Maybe I have been unlucky, but what I've ordered has never quite lived up to expectations: perfectly edible, but nothing more exciting than I could have made myself at home. (And I don't regard myself as an exceptional cook). But the main downer - as others have mentioned - is the service. It has varied from quite good to the downright awful. There is simply no excuse for waitresses being uppity with customers. It feels like they are so successful, they don't have to try too hard, which is a real pity.",

Which is exactly what Mildred's does.Tasty, inventive vegetarian dishes at what for London is a very reasonable price point - you can get out of there for less than \u00a315 if you skip the drinks and dessert.Only downside is that everyone else in London knows how good it is, too. When I went (at 6:30pm on a Thursday night) there was a 40 minute wait for a table.Highly recommended nonetheless.",

The beetroot burger was exceptional, especially the sauce, the guacamole had too much onion and was not freshly made, quite cold and obviously refrigerated, not the Mexican way. Its not difficult to mash some avocados to order and the dish ends up so much better. The sweet potato fries were also mildly warm and not crispy, again indicating that they had been sitting around for a while. I'll give Mildreds another go, but the first visit was not impressive compared to many vegan restaurants I have become acquainted with.",

Lots of varieties from sweet potato and cashew nut curry to aubergine chickpeas tagine with couscous and harissa sauce, to an awesome towering burger and stir fry asian vegetables. Sweet potato chips? Mmm :) Definitely an interesting menu .. short and sweet.Desserts did not disappoint as well. We settled on tofu cheesecake (vegan) and pistachio and white chocolate cheesecake.

I really did.Ordered some of the sweet potato wedges as a side (amazing), and for main got \"sunblushed tomato and buffalo mozzarella risotto cake served with wilted spinach, green beans and grape mustard cream sauce\". Delicious!It seems like it is always manic in there. We got there at 6pm and it was nearly full. I thought the twelve and a half percent service was cheeky, but i what can you do?Thanks Mildred!",

    "text": "Having a wheat intolerance, this restaurant is a safe heaven for myself, offering more than a handful of (vegetarian) dishes which are wheat free, gluten free or in some cases both - that also includes starters and dessert !It is one of my favourite haunts when I am in London so I do try and go every time I'm there and it is pretty much guaranteed that the place is busy no matter what time of the day. So seeing as they don't take reservations, be prepared to wait for a while - though it is definitely worth it.The quality of food is good. While not excellent, the general price of the menu balances it out bumping my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.My favourite dish is the creamy sweet potato and plum tomato curry with pea basmati and lime pickle, but be wary of the lime pickle as it can be very sour to those unsuspecting taste buds. The dessert menu is equally as good as the main, which makes it good for those sweet toothed out there. My personal recommendation is the vanilla rice pudding with golden plum compote and honeycomb - even if it is just for the melt in your mouth honeycomb pieces.The service on the whole is satisfactory, probably due to how constantly busy they are. However, my only gripe is that they add on the 12.5% service charge to your bill. I'm no Scrooge, but I do like to be my own judge of how much tip I give on any given day. So for that reason, Mildreds is 1 star shy of the full 5.",

Now if you don't read any further at least I've told you that ;)This is a v popular veggie place in Soho with the omnivore seal of approval. Whatever your x-free diet you'll still have decent choice, and they're v happy to tweak things (ask for the vegan version of the aforementioned mayo if needed!).Last week we skipped starters - personally looked a little pricey to me (over \u00a36 for 4 gyozas?). Mains are around the \u00a310 mark and nicely varied; we had a mix at the table with bean burritos and sausage+mash disappearing rapidly around me. I had the burger of the day (a tasty kidney bean and tofu creation) with the sweet potato marvels, washed down with organic cider. Having not been for a while I'd forgotten that the portions are massive so it felt pretty heavy. May have been my own fault for snacking whilst waiting for the table, woops.Speaking of which, you can't book ahead nor sit down until everyone's arrived, and there's always a ton of people waiting. Leave your name with the guy avec ipad at the door. Personal highlight of the evening was his classic 'brown guys all look the same' mistake, after he took details from one of my mates, went to check availability, then came back and replied to a different guy! *facepalm*We had a good giggle about that during our 45min wait. For the sake of your blood pressure I recommend escaping the sardines can of the bar area and heading for a drink elsewhere (or they have outdoor ping pong in nearby Golden Square atm!). Make sure you head back on time though.We sat downstairs this time and boy it was loud, as each closely-packed table seemed to be trying to outdo its neighbours - unless you fancy reverting to hand signals, be prepared to join in! Our server was v friendly and chatty, and helped my mate choose a dish in a way that felt very genuine, before joking at the end that he should've just pushed the priciest dish - nice that he didn't.Empty plates and (over)full tummies all round at the end (once I'd hoovered up everyone else's remaining sweet potato fries). The only thing we regretfully left was half a mate's elderflower martini which he'd seemed surprised to find was mostly gin... hmm yeah not sure what he was expecting!",

    "text": "I was excited to visit this popular vegetarian/vegan restaurant for a long time. Twice I had tried my luck with getting a table in the evening but then didn't want to wait that long. The third time I went there for a weekday lunch and had to wait for only about ten minutes. Unfortunately I was quite disillusioned the moment I stepped into the narrow dining room. The photographs on the website make the place look much nicer than it is.It's nice to have a menu full of veggie choices but the menu isn't really exciting or special. I ordered a Mushroom Ale Pie with Chips and Mushy Peas - bad idea! The chips and peas are not worth mentioning but the pie was really not enjoyable at all. It had a weird bitter taste.I don't think I'll go again. I'd rather accept a more resticted choice of veggie dishes but at least have a more exciting and tasteful experience.",

We were sat upstairs, which didn't have the buzz and feel of the main downstairs dining area but was nice nonetheless with open sash windows letting Soho in. You can get a drink at the bar while you wait for a table, if you like.We shared an antipasti starter for two between the five of us and all enjoyed the selection on it - great mozzarella, tomatoes, courgette strips and more. For my main I had the wild mushroom pie which came with a good portion of chips and peas. All of us were happy with our meals, veggies and non veggies alike, and between us we only made it through about half the wide ranging menu! I left very happy and very stuffed. Some of the best veggie food I've had in a long time. I'll be back.",

    "text": "When I went here with my sister, we couldn't believe how busy this place was for a vegetarian restaurant! But after our experience here, we realized it's because this restaurant serves delicious food that appeals to vegetarians and meat eaters alike.We split the pan-fried halloumi, with cherry tomato and wilted spinach with balsamic glaze to start. It was extremely flavourful, and the balsamic glaze was the perfect accent.For my entree I had the detox salad, which was a huge portion of grated beets, carrots, sprouts, and seeds. I also added tofu, which disappointingly was not marinated or cooked. My salad itself was good, but I think I would have preferred a smaller portion as a starter rather than my entree. The flavours got pretty boring after a while.My sister's sunblushed tomato, mozzarella and basil risotto cake with wilted spinach, green beans and grape mustard cream sauce was incredible though! The richness of this meal is extremely satisfying and makes you forget it doesn't even have meat in it.",

Once we were seated, the interior was cozy but cramped. I had the classic burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were great, but the burger's not all it's cracked up to be. It was okay. I avoid meat whenever I can, but almost every veggie burger pales in comparison to the original. Mildred's burger was nice, but plain, as is often the case. Although I have had some great veggie burgers, Mildred's sadly wasn't among them.",

My dessert of banoffee creme brulee, salted caramel bananas and choc chip shortbread sounded better than what I ate.

The rolling was in high gear when three separate tables requested tables different from the ones they were given (can fully sympathise that this would be frustrating within a small restaurant, but an obvious huffy eye-roll doesn't help, either).Yelp note: the neighbouring table had the burger of the day with massive wedged sweet potato fries. \u00a0Their plates looked BOMBDOTCOM.",

The sausages held together nicely, mashed potato was fantastic, and so was the kale. Washed it down with a banana, honey and soya milk smoothie. I also ate a big part of my friend's dessert: coconut black rice pudding with mango compote and coconut flakes. Heavenly, and not super sweet, which I appreciated even more.Probably my favorite meal in London. Dishoom was a very close second. Thank goodness this was recommended in my guidebook!",

The few times I have tried to get a table have been Friday/Saturday nights, and I was put off by the hour-long queue.I finally managed to go to Mildred's outside of the restaurant's peak hours at 4pm on a Friday, there were several tables available but the place was still busy.With regards to ambiance, there is very little. Mildred's is quite noisy and has no windows, I really like natural light unless the restaurant can compensate with cosy candles etc.I had already consulted the menu and knew that I was going to go for the vegan mushroom and ale pie with chips and mushy peas. The butternut squash curry that my partner opted for looked really good but I wanted to stick with my original choice, as vegetarian pies are harder to come by.When the pie arrived, I felt an initial disappointment. It was not a pot pie but rather some very watery gravy topped with some puff pastry-it didn't even seem homemade. The chips were good but too fried. My partner's curry was good once you added the coconut chilli, but nothing extraordinary. For \u00a311, the meal was quite disappointing in all honesty. Pie minster or Clives pies offerings are better than what I had here, and much cheaper. I looked at the pudding menu but didn't feel particularly inspired by the brownie and cheesecake offerings. I won't be back in a hurry.",

However, we were charged twice for it and while the manager gladly took it off, he also said, \"Oh I wouldn't even have noticed!\" Uhhhhh that doesn't make me feel any better =/I would love to try many other options on the menu and will probably return just will keep my expectations lower.

You can have a drink at the bar while you wait; my aperol spritz was refreshing after a full day of sight-seeing. I ordered the mushroom and ale pie with chips and mushy peas. As an American, I just can't understand mushy peas. But if one must eat them, these are a fine representation. The chips were perfect and the pie was very good. It's not the best dish I've had at Mildred's, but very good nonetheless. Dessert stole the show. It was a mixed berry polenta crumble. It tasted nothing like the polenta I know, and complemented the berries wonderfully. The creme anglaise served in a tiny pitcher to be poured in was a slight miss. It didn't have the richness of a traditional creme anglaise, and it being vegan is no excuse. There are plenty of rich dairy substitutes; the recipe just needs to be tweaked. I'm really splitting hairs, though, as this is still the best vegan restaurant in London despite several new additions to the vegan scene. Hopefully they take it as an opportunity to up their game and make just a few minor tweaks to make this restaurant a solid 10/10.",

I'm not vegan or vegetarian myself and was hoping that most of the food wasn't going to be RAW THIS and ROUGHAGE THAT, as most vegan places seem to be, at least in my opinion. This was far from it!! I had the bean burrito dish and it was SO GOOD. It was incredibly filling too!! Absolutely packed with beans and cheese and tasty goodness. Deffo worth it for non-veggies/vegans if you're looking to feel a bit healthier about what you're eating. :p",

Wrap was undercooked on the bottom and the whole thing was smothered in cheese, just a bit too much. Guac that came with it was ok but nothing special and iceberg salad as a side was just disappointing for a vegetarian restaurant. Overall decent food but lacking in imagination.",

Halloumi, paneer, cereals & quorn substitutes are the new ingredients in my cupboard and fridge. With good vegetables and sauces I realised that meat free dishes can be as good and tasty as meat dishes.To embrace my new found interest in veggie food, I went out for dinner at Mildred's with two friends. Opened since 1988, Mildred's serves only vegetarian food. It was my first time at Mildred's, while my vegetarian friend is a regular there. I really liked my dinner at Mildred's I didn't miss meat at all. All options sounded great, It took a bit of time to choose what we wanted qnd it was a really good value. We were all too full to get a dessert. We saw some cake on the table next to us that looked delicious, maybe next time I won't eat too much from the starter to leave some place for dessert.Service was good, not special but they were at least attentive to details which is a good thing considering they were extremely busy (apparently it is like that every day).",

The halloumi burger was absolutely delicious, crispy and full of flavour and the sweet potato fries were insane. Sweet chunky slabs of potato, sprinkled with salt. Delicious. The dessert was also incredible, I went for a peanut butter brownie with chocolate sauce. Not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical because it was gluten free and wheat free and previous experiences haven't been that good with similar products, but I definitely had nothing to worry about. The brownie was rich and melted in your mouth, with the chunks of peanut butter to add the finishing touch. The vanilla ice cream on the side was fresh and tasted like it had come straight from a vanilla pod.Not the cheapest place, but an ideal place to go for lunch, if you vegetarian and its that good, meat eaters will happy to come along for the ride.",

They do not take reservations and the wait sometimes could be long, but it is well worth it. While waiting you can take advantage of their bar from wine to beer and specialty created cocktails.One of their main dishes I recommend is the Sri Lankan sweet potato and cashew nut curry. The dish is nicely presented with big sweet chunks of sweet potatoes with yellow basmati rice with green peas topped with cilantro and chopped cashews in a cashew nut curry. The flavor of the curry was complex with flavors of coconut, cardamom, turmeric and curry leaves with the chopped sweet cashews. The thick tomato sambal on the side had tomato, cilantro and a hint of coconut that provides freshness to the dish.As for dessert, I had their sticky toffee pudding. Their take on the sticky toffee pudding is presented like a slice of cake as oppose to most of the other versions of the pudding which were served as a circular shape drenched in sauce. It had a cake-like texture rather than a soaked pudding. The rich and sweet sauce was lightened by the sweet cream served on the side.Good food and a great staff. A true gem to dine at. I would definitely return to Mildreds next time I am back in London.",

The fritters were delightful. Soft, light, fluffy and very tasty, they don't taste like tofu at all it was surprising, the melon and coconut sauce balanced it out perfectly. Next we had the asian vegetable stir fry with brown rice. This too was very tasty, vegetables were crispy.Mildreds also has a great salad bar which is good for a cheap and healthy take away lunch.

I love and definitely recommend the risotto cake, burrito, and some of the pasta specials they've offered. Hubby loves the Sri Lankan curry. Desserts are amaaaaazing, so do leave room for those! (we've had cheesecakes and creme brulees and they were yummy!) The one dish I was disappointed by was the sweet potato fries, which were more like wedges. But others seem to really like them, so it's up to you!The space is tight and it can get quite noisy, but it's a friendly atmosphere with attentive and helpful staff.

The whole restaurant is very narrow and cramped, you sit in canteen-y rows, which I didn't like. The atmosphere was very dry and the place was stuffed with irritating people (the kind who are trying desperately to make their conversations as audible to as many outsiders as possible). There actually weren't too many vegan options to be honest - I settled on a sweet potato curry. The sweet potato curry was perfectly balanced in terms of seasoning but the chef had obviously decided that it would be a good idea to use an entire can of coconut cream as its base. The result was a very fatty and overly rich sauce with chunks of sweet potato in it (the person next to me ordered the same dish and they too only managed to get through half of it).My friend had a burrito which was a very uninspiring wrap stuffed with kidney beans - she also detested the food / place.The staff were distracted and bored. Overall I was disappointed with every aspect of it. Definitely won't be back.",

I go to Mildred's a lot because its yummy. My most recent visit was at a friends *cough*44th*cough* and she'd booked out the private room upstairs. It was nice, clean, away from the hustle and bustle of what is normally the mega busy and cramped downstairs. There is a min spend, but we all covered that no problem. The food smells divine, looks scrummy, good portion sizes and is just Moorish. Trying to avoid naughty carbs (with my usual choice being the ale and mushroom pie which I really recommend) I had a Tagine with cous cous. Spicy sauce on the side and a bit of flat bread it was just perfect. I couldn't handle the desert, but they looked nice and from the orgasmic sounds everyone else was making, its a good sign.It's got a good organic wine list, nice selection of beers and cocktails. The waiter may have accidentally mistaken my partner as my mother, but ... that's just plain funny.",

So, I was delighted to find Mildred's. We went on a Friday night and it was jam-packed. But the service was excellent -- we were able to get a drink while we waited and the wait staff took extra good care of us. My friend tried the mushroom pie with mushy peas. The dish was a little on the salty side, but very good. We LOVED the sweet potato fries as a starter... and I tried the vegan special version of bangers and mash. Oh, and save room for pudding! It will be hard, but you won't regret it when you bite into the fruit crumble and vegan ice cream.Thank goodness for you, Mildred... and your vegetarian ways. I'll be back soon.",

The food is overall really nice, it's the service that can be lacking.Last year was the worst. At lunch we waited longer for food than everyone around who ordered after us, was brought the wrong food, the correct food was cold and with hair in it. Not even a \"sorry\" from the staff, just bitterness. And that's why I haven't been back in a year.Last week I took a gaggle of out-of-towners for dinner here because it has something for everyone and it was DELIGHTFUL! Excellent and attentive service, great ambiance, didn't wait very long, the food was superb- wowing the sceptical omnivores to the jaded vegans! It has absolutely renewed my faith in them and I will definitely be bringing friends here for the dinner service!",

However the food was very bland and tasteless!Having dinner with a group of girls and we of course had dessert, we had the raspberry and dark chocolate truffle and salted caramel, hazelnut and chocolate cheesecake. The truffle was ordinary, the dusting of chocolate left a weird taste in your mouth. But the cheesecake was fantastic! the salted caramel was great!I would definitely recommend this restaurant on the following conditions, 1. catching up with friends2. if you have vegetarian friends The service was slow but the staff was great fun!",

Tasty, but simple.Anyway, the food is definitely delightful, and the last time I went, I had brought my college best friend who was visiting from LA and a recently turned veggie. We had chatted about this place, mainly because there aren't enough LA veggie restaurants and I was proud to show off the local homage to veggie dining. \u00a0Friend has never been stumped for choice since turning veggie and loved the fact that he couldn't quite come to a choice. He settled on the sweet potato curry (which is very good - and a staple on the menu) and I went with the chick pea burger. All in all, Mildred's is a good place to go even if you are an omnivore because the atmosphere is great, the food's good and the wine list decent. 4*s! Will definitely return.

We had a bottle of wine - an organic Malbec that rang in at just over 20 quid, which was very good value, I thought, as it was a pretty tasty wine (they had sub-20 quid bottles, too). Sweet rather than dry, but that's sometimes nice. We each had a starter, a main and we split a dessert. Starters were dumplings for her and a salad of rocket, blue cheese, figs and walnuts for me; both were great. Mains were the burger with sweet potato fries, and the 'detox' salad, which was lots of carrots and other assorted veggies. For dessert we had the dark chocolate and raspberry truffle, which was delicious and went well with the wine (n.b. I usually think pairing food and wine is a dubious endeavor, but in this case it worked well - good work, us). The whole meal came to a little under 70 quid, which while isn't cheap isn't bad either for a multi-course meal and full bottle of wine. I would definitely return to this place.",

    "text": "So I just moved to London temporarily and I've had a tough transition with finding non-greasy proper vegetarian food. Then I stumbled upon Mildreds and I never want to go back to New York City ever again (ok not really I'll be happy to go back there, but wow this place is amazing). I should also say I've hardly been in London for a month and I've already been here twice. First time I had the detox salad and the mint tea. The salad was huge by London portion standards and was very tasty. My only complaint was too many shredded carrots not enough other veggies. The mint was very good as well.But, my second meal was what my me need to write a review. I had the veggie burger of the day with fries that came with basil mayo. Now I don't like mayo, in fact it really grosses me out. But instead of seeing mayo I saw basil goodness. and boy was it basil goodness. The burger was also really good but it was the basil mayo that pulled everything together. I also had a raspberry vanilla lemonade the was crazy good. I don't drink so I'm always happy to find something non-alcholic to drink on the menu that isn't your standard coke, sprite etc. Then I had the passion fruit panna cotta like dessert. Now I should say that panna cotta and all related cream desserts are my favorite. But that being said I'm also incredibly picking about my panna cotta. This passion fruit amazingness at Mildreds was one of the top ones I've had anywhere. It was sosososo good I could really just go back to eat that.Anyways if you are veggie or like veggie friendly food and you are in London you would really be missing out if you didn't hit this place up.",

    "text": "In March I had finally touched down in London for the first time in my life. My friend and her roommate are vegan and were showing me around town. We all have pretty hefty appetites so this was our first stop. At first we were told that the wait would be 20 minutes, but we were seated upstairs within 7. The first level has a greenhouse roof, which allows natural light to seep in and was rather lovely, but we didn't mind heading upstairs.The restaurant is blends rustic, old fashioned, and modern decor and the vibe was very refreshing. We sat down and were given a bottle of spring water in minutes. Since I don't have any restrictions while I'm on vacation, I was open to eating anything. We ordered one of the salads as an appetizer for the table - everything in the menu will make your mouth water. Both the waitress and my friends recommended that I try the wood roasted mushroom and ale pie with minted mushy peas and fries, so I did. It reminded me of home because in my culture we use puff pastry for a number of dishes and this one was filled with a mushroom soup/porridge. The seasoning was on point and I just devoured that portion. The minty mashed peas cooled down thw heat from the mushroom mix and added it's own flare to the serving. I think that was my favorite part of the dish. The fries made me feel guilty, but c'mon...who doesn't like fries? My reason for giving it 4 stars is because I want to return and try their other items. I didn't have enough to fully rate this restaurant, but I'm sure it can be deserving of 5. The service was great as we were checked on every few minutes. Vegan or not, you will leave Mildreds stuffed and with a big smile on your face, especially because it's not detrimental to your bank account! :)",

Not sure what diet my friend follows but I sensed that she will love this venue. She isn't big fund of meat and loves yoga, fresh juice, loves Asian food then I thought about this place. Both of us had SriLankan sweet potatoes curry. That was divine. Roasted cashew nuts were just the perfect one to be in curry. Portion is giant so we were so right skipping small plates. We were digging in the plate as soon as served on the table. We didn't wait for long. Since it's small place you are hardly neglected. We were so full and couldn't taste desserts afterwards. It's high carb so suggested for someone who works out. I burnt 600kcal in the gym that day. It'll be ideal if it's low fat... (HCLF?)I'm dreaming this curry for days and days.I just NEED to go back and have the same one again.Limited number of the table hence 4 stars.",

The tables were fairly close together, *insert celebrity name drop here* knocked a karafe of water over with his bum- but, if there were less tables, it would take even longer to get one! I ate the halloumi burger with sweet potato fries whilst sipping on an elderflower martini (you might have figured I like gin and floral flavours by now!) it was beautiful, and the Harissa added a nice kick. We had a particularly lovely lady server, who was fab. After that we had puddings, pecan pie and the polenta cake, the polenta cake in particular, was a ruddy dream, and we recommended this to *celebrity name drop*, and he agreed. The reason I haven't given them 5* is due to the little downer at the end- the added 12.5?% (I think, it might have been 15%) gratuity, with a note saying you can ask for it to be removed OF COURSE WE ARENT GOING TO ASK, WE'RE AWKWARD AND BRITISH!!! This is one step on pet hates behind handing the man the bill, especially when I'm paying- we genuinely would have tipped more than that- but I'm like a petulant child when it comes to showing my appreciation, I don't want to be told I have to do anything!!!!!!",

The dish was absolutely mouth watering with the perfect mixture of my favourite veggies and the most flavourful seasoning. My other friends had burgers and a curry, all of which they seemed to enjoy. The aperol was also good, though slightly more alcoholic than other ones that I've tried. Ambience was small and cozy. Not the most spacious of venues, but it added to the atmosphere and personality.Lastly, service was good. Not the most attentive with regular check-in's or anything, but they knew when to come take our orders, serve the food, bring the desserts menu and bring the bill. I would absolutely go back!",

But the menu options are numerous and delicious. I had a tough time deciding but eventually chose the veggie stir fry. My portion was enormous and I loved the contrasting textures of crunchy greens and cashews with the soy-soaked tofu and brown rice. My companions also hoovered up their veggie burrito and risotto. Alas, we were all too stuffed for dessert. Although truth be told, they didn't look that exciting. Sugar-free choc torte - say whaat?The bill came to \u00a364 for three mains and four drinks. Not great value when you consider there's no meat involved but then the quality was outstanding. I'd definitely be up for visiting Mildred's again.",

    "text": "Having waited 30mins for a table, Mildreds had much to answer for. Turns out the decor is wooden, simple and rustic and the service was a little sparse at times. Unfortunately they were not able to serve any fresh juices on the day I visited. Nevertheless the food itself was genuinely very agreeable. To a meat-eater, an indicator of good vegetarian food is when you don't even feel that there is anything missing from the meal i.e. there is no void left from having not consumed meat.The Mexican platter was an array of delights; everything from the soft warm black beans, the crunchy corn chips, the delightfully sour cream dip, and the chunky guacamole to the mango, brie and jalape\u00f1o quesadilla seemed fresh, appetising and prepared with a touch of pride. The variety of mains on the menu is equally impressive with an abundance of creative recipes giving you the age-old dilemma of what to choose. I eventually opted for the stir fried Asian vegetables (in shitake mushroom sauce with garlic, ginger, fresh chilli and coriander, served with organic brown rice, tofu and toasted cashews). This was a masterful creation; the abundance of ingredients work very well together to produce a mixture of flavours and textures and a very filling as well as balanced dish.\u00a0In short all the food was attractive, served in pristine fashion and thoroughly satisfying. To be honest I can't quite put my finger on what it is missing that places it just shy from perfection in my mind, but I sense that in totality the restaurant could do with some refinement in interior design, staffing, its booking system (or lack thereof), and its choice of china and cutlery as well as a little bit of originality; little things that can make a difference but often go unnoticed. But have no doubt, Mildreds is a treasure trove of a vegetarian restaurant.",

The summer rolls were amazing light and flavorful. The curry had a lovely presentation and the flavors of the sweet potato blended well coconut milk and cashews. The brownie with ice cream was like chocolate heaven. This place seemed like a great spot for a date or small dinner party. They had a creative cocktail list which also makes it nice for drinks.

    "text": "please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Mildreds is my favourite (cheap) vegetarian restaurant in London. I once in the while go there on weekends, after I had maybe a couple of drinks too many and loads of heavy food the day (the week?) before, for some small detoxing/feeling better about my body food (it's by far better than sports :) ). What I also like about it is, that it is not one of those annoying 'into your face vegetarian all meat eaters are bad' places but just happens to serve vegetarian food. so what. At my last visit I had delicious hummous and babaganoush (5.75) served with flat bread. The hummous perfectly creamy, the babaganoush very nicely seasoned with the distinct flavour of smoked aubergine and the flat bread crispy and fresh. There was no fault at all with this dish. Then the all important detoxing with the organic energising detox salad (7.00). I love this salad, I must have had it 10 times already: a full plate of crunchy carrots, fennel, different sprouts, fresh coriander, sultanas and pumpkin seeds with a lime-ginger dressing (I usually like to add some chilli sauce, then it's even more perfect). It tastes so fresh and moreish while being so healthy, sometimes this kind of food just hits the spot. Mildreds has daily changing specials, usually some soup, some vegetarian burger and a pasta dish and dessert. Regarding the desserts: even though I have never eaten any of them myself (I told you \u00a0detoxing!), they look absolutely amazing (and the people eating them look very happy). The staff is young, pleasant and nice to chat to and even though I have never been there for dinner, I would rather regard it as a lunch place, maybe not quite romantic date material (unless you want to impress a vegetarian of course!)",

We just stood at the bar and had a drink. The tables are close together, so it's not somewhere you want to go for an intimate date, but it's not uncomfortable. We ordered some delicious hummus and baba ganoush as a starter, and for the mains we had the bangers and mash and the Ethiopian stew. As dessert the chocolate red currant brownie. We didn't leave raving about the food, but it was definitely good. What I liked about it was that they serve vegetarian versions of \"real food\". Contrary to other reviews we'd read, the service was friendly enough and quick with our orders.",

Time it right in your arrival you must otherwise it's 'a half hour to 45 minute wait' and left to stand with drinks in hand in the bar/entrance that doubles as the holding pen you will be. Lucky little me I know three of the staff that work here so I'm often through the door to take the weight off my feet and have a cup of coffee mid afternoon when things aren't quite as crazy: between services. So biased I may be but I do think this is a great little place. The atmosphere is friendly and energetic while still allowing for a relaxing meal, the restaurant area is flooded with light during daylight hours from the glazed panels in the roof and the food never takes long to arrive. And and and, thank goodness they understand about decent sized portions for your bucks. Long gone are the days of worthy vegetarian restaurants where the menu was uninspiring and limited to nutroast or nutroast. Mildred's menu has dishes inspired from all corners of the globe but best in my opinion is still the mushroom and porchini pie. Where's the gravy? Inside. It's good.",

We had two starters - beets with feta that was so-so in flavor but high marks for presentation and freshness. The other starter was a ricotta mushroom ravioli with a porcini sauce (ther was a sage butter option for these ravioli as well, but I was SOO happy with the delectable porcini sauce!)I had the mushroom-ale pie with minty peas and some substantial thick-cut fried potato wedges. The mushroom pie was smoky, woodsy, rich, meaty - in a superb and delicate flaky crust akin to phyllo - also with a very nice presentation...really the highlight of my meal. The peas definitely on this side of yum. The fries a bit soggy, but certainly ranked above edible (it's hard to make good fries). Service was prompt and friendly, although not super attentive (they forgot to replace our forks and it took a while to get someone's attention - a forgivable mistake though not terribly high level). I'd recommend Mildreds for any vegetarians (or part-time vegetarians such as myself) as a solid and reliable dinner spot with interesting and flavorful dishes.",

Yet, although the food was quite good, it didn't quite make the cut for saying \"I'm a fan\". I think I liked my appetizer best (artichoke crostini with vegan mayonaise), but the main (burger of the day) was rather average, and the sweet potato fries that I thought I had to try given that everyone seems to love them were good, but not outstanding. The dessert (chocolate truffle) was delicious again, but ultimately I was just a wee bit disappointed by the food (the main in particular). I also think that the service could definitely be better - our waiter was charming enough, but at the same time seemed distracted and not really interested in his job. The lacklustre service notwithstanding, they do make a point of adding an \"optional\" service charge of 12.5% to the bill (are we approaching American conditions here now?), which I definitely think is not cool.So all in all we had a pleasant evening, and the food was good, but it wasn't to fall in love with, and with the service being what it was I can't give more than 3 stars.",

Your Sweet Potato fries are worth the journey alone and you actually make your veggie burgers rather than buying frozen soy patties. The risotto cakes, your soups, the sage butternut squash ravioli, in fact I would gladly eat anything on your menu. Well except for that green Thai curry dish. Let's be honest, you kind of mailed it in on that one... and I do have to say I was pouty when you replaced the raspberries in your flourless dark chocolate cake with oranges. Am I the *only* person who things dark chocolate and orange is a bad idea?Still, you are easily one of my London favorites. At a similar price point to Eat and Two Veg, frankly Mildred, it isn't even close. I've taken a number of non veggie guests to you and everybody loves it. In fact, my parents are coming to visit again in October, guess where they want to eat again? My mom even remembered your name; Mildred, *that* is saying something.You do get busy for dinner most nights and always on the weekend evenings, which sometimes lead to slow service. I hate to wait, but for you, I will. And what is this whole waiter attitude thing I'm reading about, because you always treat me right. Mildred, you can tell me, am I your favorite? (Ah, I knew it!)Even if some other Yelpers haven't been showing you the love here recently, I'm here to let you know that you are 6 stars in my book.",

    "text": "On my numerous visits to Mildreds over the past few years I've enjoyed the tasty food, the wine, the extensive vegan options and even the notoriously offish waiting staff. I used to smile and tell funny tales about being served by sulky waitresses, pointing out to friends that as long as the food stayed good and came in a reasonable time I didn't care what mood the staff were in. It saves on tipping, right? Last time I went, however, the shine had dulled on my Mildreds experience . A group of six of us headed there for my birthday meal, arriving one by one over the space of about 20 minutes. There was plenty of space and I was assured we could definitely have a table, but that we'd have to wait until we had all arrived before we could sit down. This had happened to me before at Mildreds so I wasn't surprised, but as two of us, then three of us, then four, then five ended up standing in the crowded bar area at the front of the restaurant in full view of our empty, ready and waiting table I got more and more annoyed about the policy. Eventually I lied and said the last person couldn't make it just so we were allowed to sit down and look at the menuwhen she showed up 10 minutes later a waitress huffily brought her cutlery back. I'm not a silly teenager and don't really expect special treatment on my birthday from complete strangers, but let's just say the moody Mildreds staff failed to amuse me that night. However you feel about your customers, having a certain degree of respect for the fact that they are paying for the privilege of sitting and eating in your restaurant is surely a standard requirement, and appreciating that there are plenty of other places to choose to go to for friendlier, less uppity service on special occasions might make them try a bit harder to keep customers coming back. The one thing they have is the nice food, but it's not amazing enough for me to forget the rest. I've probably been to Mildreds about seven times over the past two years, but the way I feel about the place right now I couldn't tell you when or if I will be back. The churlish service compounded with recent information that their famed veggie burgers were made with Sosmix - a soya protein mix you can get in shops for about \u00a32 - has really put me off. With so many other good places to eat in the vicinity I think I'm going to be giving miserable Mildreds a miss for a while at least.",

The vegetable stir fries are very filling by themselves but can be made even more so by adding Tofu. The last time I went I had a very satisfying mushroom and ale pie with mushy peas and chips. It made a great healthier veggie option to a steak and ale pie. Desserts, if you can fit them in, are fantastic. There's always a good fruity crumble with cream or custard and if you go when the meringue is on the menu, it's wonderful.",

It is busy and it is small and it does feel kind of cramped and there's a very haughty waitressbutthe quality of the food makes up for all of that. Also of note is the private dining room, which you can book free of charge and is an elegant upstairs room decorated with some fine examples of Victorian pornography. Which is certainly a talking point. This room is perfect for a special occasion and I've never had a problem booking it.",

    "text": "Always love a bit of Mildreds. They have a no booking policy though (unless you have 10ppl + then they have a private dining area), so be prepared to wait.. 40mins to and hour+. Standard. Don't be fooled by the mirror at the far end of the restaurant, it doesn't actually have that many seats! So generally you have to wait at the bar after putting your name down with the maitre d. It can be very busy on a Friday night, we went on a Friday recently and there was already an hour long wait at 6pm with more people queueing. It can be pretty frantic and confusing if you've never been before though so be prepared, it's quite a narrow space and if you walk in you're kind of stuck in limbo between people trying to get a drink and getting to the MD to find out what's going on. I saw a poor American tourist that was trying to figure out how long the wait was so he did the natural thing and asked the closest staff member behind the bar, she rolled her eyes and very curtly told him she was bar staff and that he had to try and fight through to ask someone else. We thought the way she spoke was pretty rude. The food is pretty good for vegetarian though. Service can def be a bit better... even trying to order once sat, and trying to pay was a little bit of a mission. Plenty of staff on too so not sure what happened. Would give more stars but just thought the service was below par and ambience was too stressful. It's a shame because it used to be much better.",

We actually had a shares table, so my two person group shared a four person table with another two person group. It worked out totally fine since they were super nice (new friends!) but it could be close quarters for others.We had the dumplings appetizer. It was a little smaller than anticipated. But the flavour (especially sauce) was great. For mains, both the Sri Lankan bowl and Halloumi Burger had great flavour and were very decent sized portions for London. My favorite thing was the sweet potato fries, though. They were huge and perfect. Just perfect.",

    "text": "A vegetarian/vegan restaurant? Most people would scoff and be none too pleased to be brought here (that's if you could get in as the queues and wait list is quite hefty). You've got to suck it up and acknowledge there'll be no meat but it will be one of the tastiest meals ever. This is the most impressed I've been with a restaurant in a while! And although this isn't 5* food, as in Michelin */posh nosh, it certainly is 5* for what it is - amazing tasting, full of flavours, nice decor and vibe, friendly service and huge portions - really proving that meat isn't everything! Mildred's doesn't take bookings and as a walk in establishment you are guaranteed a wait. We (2 of us) arrived shortly after 5.30 on a Friday and popped our names on the waitlist with an estimated sit down time of 6. You have to wait at the restaurant so can't go anywhere else for a drink but they have a bar and places to perch (with only a few chairs outside). We found somewhere to lean and ordered two cocktails for the wait. At \u00a37 they are reasonably priced. I got the rose and gin cocktail - very refreshing and would definitely order it again. Perching quite close to where the food was coming out meant we got to drool over that while perusing the menu ready for when we were seated (we were on a tight schedule as going to the theatre after). We were seated pretty much bang on 6 in the back of the restaurant - a lovely open, high, glass ceilinged spaced. It is very bright, modern and spacious throughout although some of the tables looked a bit squished together - we were lucky enough to have plennnnty of space as we had a few bags of shopping as well. There is also a downstairs however I have no idea what it is like! After ogling the burgers for 30 minutes, both my friend and I got their famous vegan burgers with the addition of Monterey Jack cheese (making them only veggie). They kindly brought out the vegan cheese for us to try as I was curious - cold it was grossss. I can see that once melted in the burger it would be a good alternative. \u00a0We also ordered sweet potato chips and corn chips with avocado as sides. The food came after about 15 minutes, which was reasonable but I was soooo hungry I barely managed a photo before I devoured it. Both burgers were so good, full of flavour, with a yummy brioche bun and a huge slice of tomato and crisp lettuce. The sweet potato chips were nice (a bit soggy which I love) and were served with an amazing chipotle ketchup and basil mayo. The corn chips were ok, nothing special but the guacamole was gooood (quite garlicky). One thing to note is the portions are huge! Each burger was \u00a38 and sides about \u00a34/5 but it is well worth it - I was so so full and satisfied. While we were finishing our mains a couple next to us were sharing the most decadent chocolate brownie I've ever seen. We were seriously tight for time and super full however after finding out the peanut brownie and ice cream was all vegan, and spotting some tasty sounding dessert cocktails, we asked if the waitress could rush our order through and also bring the bill. This she did with no problem and kept checking up on our drinks order for us - such good service. As promised we were out of there in time to catch our show (just!) but not before enjoying the tastiest brownie. The ice cream tasted so good that the lady next to us was demanding that it couldn't possibly be dairy free! The cocktails were also good especially the bourbon bomb however we didn't quite have the time to appreciate them. In total the bill came to just under \u00a370 with service charge which although isn't cheap is brilliant for the amount of food, quality of food and service. This is why they deserve their 5*.I can't wait to come back (showing it off to other friends) to try the rest of menu - as well as the burgers they have a whole host of meals like curry, risotto cakes and stir fry that looked and smelled delish as well as other desserts like choco cake and orange cake.",

From the apps to the large plates to dessert, we enjoyed every dish and left nothing behind. It was all really filling so come hungry.

    "text": "From the friendly host to the spectacular chips, Mildred's stole my heart from the get-go. New to London, it's splendor, and it's vegan scene,Mildred's immediately popped up when I searched vegan options in the area. Getting there was a mission, as my friend and I hopped on a bicycle-cart (don't know the name of this transportation mode off the top off my head) , and directed the rider using Yelp/Google Maps/my minimal common sense in getting about the area. After some missed turns and slight freak outs caused by the weather (us L.A folks don't do well in rain) and a tight schedule (fifteen hour layover in London for a first timer), we made it to Mildred's an hour short of closing.Greeted by a extremely outgoing and Chatty-Cathy host, we were told the wait would be about fifteen minutes. We didn't mind and made our way to the bar to charge our nearly deceased phones. I had already scoped the menu, so I had some options in mind, and the expo window, close to the bar, allowed me to see up close what my options looked like. Initially, I was sold on the Ale Pie with fries and mushy peas (there are hundred of reviews highlighting this dish, just scroll down), but after taking a look at the tofu-lentil burger with fries that were being delivered to tables, I went into contemplation. Once we were seated (the wait ended up being shorter than expected), the contemplation became a full-blown debate. The options! Only one night in London! The foodie in me was about to have a melt down! So I went with my gut (quite literally) and ordered the burger because the dipping sauce and fries paired it in a way that made it irresistible to ignore. My friend ordered a stir fry (he never does this--ever--I was shocked).The wait wasn't long at all (maybe ten minutes) and people watching for a newbie was a fun at its best during my wait. Our food arrives, we proceed to dig in (because the clock is ticking and London is waiting for us). The food was marvelous. Every--single--bite. The fries were everything London is known for if not more, the burger was so fresh tasting, the tofu and lentils perfectly balanced and creating a soft patty, and the sauce (an aioli or blue cheese of a sort) was divine. The same for the dipping sauce the fries were paired with. I was just way too happy with my selection. I tried a bite of my friend's dish and it was Asian-fusion at its finest. As I finish this review, I can't help but feel nostalgic and sad that I won't be back to Mildred's for what might be years. Oh well, at least I got to try it and it's amazing, vegan cuisine while in the U.K. This place is a gem that if in the states, I would be an avid regular of. A well earned five stars. Did I mention the host is awesome?",

It was one of the top searches when you look for vegetarian in London.I get there at around 7pm, they don't do reservations, and the place is heaving. I mean I had very little room to walk amongst others in the queue awaiting a table. Everyone's chatting, people are looking happy, the bar staff and the waiters are on the go constantly. Fortunately a half hour later we got a table (minus one star) and it was a shared table upstairs. The menu is straight forward - they have about 5 mains to select from, so you don't have to over think on decisions, I went for the tomato bean sausages with the mash and spinach, and it was delicious!!! They put these herbs in - I don't know what but it something similar to a wasabi kick! Also had cauliflower and sweet potato on the side - definitely recommend. My two other friends were loving it and we all agreed we would definitely come back. Unexpectedly - awesome. I love surprises.",

I had the Grilled artichokes with cashew cream and grilled lemon. Holy smokes this is my new favorite thing! For my main I got the polish burger, it is a beet root and bean base which is a decently firm burger compared to many vegan patties. The herb mayo is really nice as well. I would definitely recommend this place without a doubt. Lastly, I ended with the chocolate hazelnut brownie w/ice cream. Very nice. Crumbly but not dry. A bit sweet but you expect that from this type of dessert. I will absolutely come back every time I'm in the area. And they do have some non vegan options for the picky eater!",

And at 3 pm on a Thursday afternoon it was packed, so you know it's good when it's packed at an odd time like that. Keep it up, Mildreds!

The dishes we got were good but I'd focus on the cuisines that have a heritage of vegetarian or vegan fare. Gyoza was surprisingly tasty. I really enjoyed this and they were better than some of the Asian restaurants I've been too. The filling had a bit of texture unlike some veggie dumplings which can be quite mushy. Side of Asian broccoli (which was actually tenderstem \u00a0broccolini and not gai lan) was well cooked with a nice sweet soy sauce dressing. Nothing special but well prepared. I had the sausage and mash with cabbage as main. This didn't fare so well. Mash and cabbage were comparable to what you'd probably make at home but the sausages tasted too strongly of fennel seeds. One bite could be quite bland but another could fill your mouth with a liquorice taste. Slightly off putting. Overall, the meal was fine. The atmosphere is quite modern which is a nice change from the hippy dippy places that normally make up veggie restaurants. \u00a0The dishes seem slightly hit or miss but I'd be open to coming back and trying more.",

I think the \"giant\" part sucked me in. Unfortunately, the stew was a bit heavy on the beetroot, and I was sorry I didn't order something that came with those delectable sweet potato fries. What is it about those tasty little fellas?Dessert: a fruit crumble (the fruit in it changes daily, mine was apple) sans cream that was absolutely scrumtrulescent. Piping hot apples beneath the sugary crumbly crumble. Yum.

    "text": "Caution: fickle veggie alert! From reading past Yelper reviews of Mildred's in Soho, I know this place is very popular so I feel naughty posting a not so nice review. As far as queuing goes, we waltzed right in and got a table immediately. Our waiter gave me the smug look of superiority as I dared to order a Diet Coke. No corporate companies here, all organic juices and freedom beer - fair play to them! With a bit of lunchtime rush I went for the soup of the day - Pumpkin and Carrot. It arrived in a brilliant dash of yellow flecked with parsley. Wow I was salivating already; this was quickly followed by disappointment. The distinct taste of the pumpkin was robbed by the overpowering flavour of chilli, making it quite spicy to my shy tastebuds. Never one for liking hot, spicy food I left most of it in the bowl. I can't understand why they would add this to the soup; no pumpkin/squash soup recipes I have ever seen incorporate chilli. But once I tasted the accompanying bread I sussed. The focaccia was soft, a touch salty and also chock full of spices, same for the rustic brown bread. After a couple of bites of everything, it felt like I had swallowed a spice rack. Vegetarian food is often accused of being bland, boring and tasteless. Mildred's seems to be ensuring that no-one dismiss its food this way by totally overcompensating on the spices. While I won't be running back there any time soon, I would like to try the burgers, burritos and salads I saw whizzing by.",

    "text": "Yum yummy yum yum good for my tum tum.I went here with my sister a few months back and was really impressed. Both of us have been veggie since we were kids and our mum has spoilt us with great home cooked vegetarian dishes all our lives so it takes a lot to get us excited about veggie food. The place is quite small and does get busy quick so I'd book or go early. This is the only reason why the place hasn't got 5 stars. But saying that, if it was any bigger I think it would lose some of it's friendly and warm atmosphere.They have great sweet potato chips and the menu has a huge selection of tasty dishes. I thought is was well priced for what you were getting and overall it was a great meal out.Also, for you celeb spotters out there, Keria Knightly is often in here so keep a eye out in case she pinches a chip off your plate!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time about a month ago. Funny story though, my group and I had tried going to this location two years ago when we took a trip to London then, but the wait was over an hour and we didn't want to wait that long, so we went somewhere else. Now, flash forward to this year, we tried going here the first night of our trip, and the same thing happened again, and we left to go eat somewhere else. But then, we tried going the next night (the night this review is about) again a little earlier, and we didn't have to wait. So long story short: book ahead of time or get there before 6pm.LOCATION: This location is in Soho, and it's pretty near Oxford and Regent Streets, as well as Piccadilly Circus. It's a fairly nice area. 4/5ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere is alright. We were sat in an upstairs area and it was kind of bland and stuffy, but the downstairs area looked a bit nicer. 3/5SELECTION: It's all vegetarian, and they label which items are vegan or can be made vegan. They serve a nice variety of different cuisines too. 3/5WHAT I GOT: I got the Soul Bowl, which includes carrot, beetroot, quinoa, cherry tomato, dates, parsley, mint, kale, avocado, shiitake mushrooms, cashew cheese (I got it on the side), mixed sprouts, seeds, and sesame dressing. It was okay, but nothing worthwhile. It didn't taste as fresh as it could and the flavors of the vegetables weren't that vibrant. I liked the variety of ingredients though. I would still go back and try something else though. 3/5SERVICE: The service was okay. The employees were nice, but it was just pretty standard service -- nothing stood out -- so that's why I just put an average rating. 3/5",

This comes with rice too.And it was very tasty. You wouldn't tell it was vegan or vegetarian. It had rich flavours and the portions are very decent. For dessert:Apple and pear crumble with a creamy topping!!. That was a scrumptious meal and we couldn't afford to have any more. This is an extremely busy place. Only just realized that there are so many around who appreciate vegetarian food in London. There can be a good 15 to 20 minutes of waiting time, but the bar is always good to entertain you. They have a whole load of vegan/vegetarian drinks. So feel free to sip something while waiting to be seated. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone.",

The vegan options were boring and tasted equally as boring too. I had the soul bowl this time and wasn't impressed. The kale included in the dish was marinated in a sauce with odd flavor too, it was almost like they just dumped soy sauce on it. I also ordered the fries with the vegan basil mayo--seemed like they used the vegan mayo recipes from the early 2000's and not today, total waste of calories.All in all, not my favorite. Plus, the waiter was a snot to us the whole time. This is something that's happened to me before while dining at Mildreds. No thanks!",

I must say that it was not to my liking, the burger, since there was too much vegan aioli and not much else as filling except a few sad leaves of lettuce. The burger reminded me too much of a McChicken from McDonalds, but of course if that's what you like, then you'll love it. The fries were really good though. My mum had an indian style type dish that she enjoyed.I am not sure we will choose this place again, the noise in there was incredibly loud as well, making it difficult to have a conversation.",

Not by the bartender or anyone who was awkwardly staring at us, as we looked for a host. We were asked if we were okay with a communal table, as a 2 top wouldn't be available for 20-30 minutes. We said that was fine and sat down at an empty 4 top. I was facing the restaurant, and within 5 minutes of being seated, two 2 tops were vacated. Okay then. We were served promptly and the food was good, although days later, I cannot for the life of me remember what I ordered, besides the dumplings as an appetizer. We were headed to the theater after our meal, so when our plates were cleared and we were asked if we wanted dessert, I declined and asked for the check. Instead of the check, a different waiter brought dessert menus. Okayyyyy. Once he came back (he literally dropped them and then scooted away), I asked for the check again, paid and left. All in all, if randomness is your thing, you'd probably like this place. It was also super loud, as the restaurant itself is very small.",

    "text": "I have been stalking Mildreds and planning my order since we booked our flights ten months prior to our trip. My husband and I went to the UK to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, timing our stay so that our actual anniversary day was spent in London proper with an upscale dinner at Mildred's in Soho. The thing about Mildred's is that there is often a very long wait, as they don't take reservations, and there is hardly any room to stand and gawk at the outcoming dishes. I'm here to tell you, it was worth every waiting minute.We began our meal with the Grilled Artichoke Crostini, perfectly cooked artichoke hearts drizzled with lemon over chargrilled rustic bread. However, the star of the show was the labneh, a yogurt-based cheese that they have veganized. It was so creamy and fresh I nearly licked the plate! That and that alone would have been worth it!For our entree's, I choose a Katsu Curry Chick'n, served with forbidden rice and sensible green vegetables. My husband enjoyed the burger, along with a sizeable serving of sweet potato fries. While we waited, I was so excited and eager to be there that I chatted up the hostess after she kindly remarked on my sequined dress. Though Mildred's is upscale casual, that wasn't going to stop me from glamming up for our anniversary night! I told the hostess how much I had been looking forward to our dining there, and that it was our anniversary, and after we sat she brought us two glasses of bubbly as a bit of an anniversary gift! It was so very sweet of her! Mildred's absolutely lives up to the hype. They are worth every bit of the street cred they get from vegans and carnie's alike, and my only complaint is that they are not in Las Vegas where we live. It was a life-changing dining experience!",

We were told that we would have to wait 1.5 hours until we could be seated and that we would have to wait either by the bar or next door. We choose the bar which turned out to be a great decision as the cocktails were amazing! I highly recommend the bourbon splash and old fashioned something-or-another. They were also really reasonably priced (only \u00a37.5 for a cocktail in central London). I guess the make up for it by always being busy and requiring patrons to wait by the bar.I really enjoyed the food too. I had some tofu and white bean sausage with mashed potatoes and other veg (basically a vegan bangers and mash). I really enjoyed it and the atmosphere was great. The only downside was the service, but even so, it wasn't thaaat bad (still 5 star worthy). The waiters didn't pour the wine or let us try it before hand (it wasn't a screw cap!) but luckily it was fine. We also had to wait a while for the bill etc. If they sort this out they'll really be a spectacular vegan restaurant.",

    "text": "Bring your appetite and patience because the food here is excellent with large portions and it's a bit of a wait for seating. We waited about 45 minutes for two seats and ended up sharing a table with another couple. We ended up ordering the following items:APPETIZER:Chargrilled roman style artichoke with crostini and lemon aioli - (4 star) \u00a36.00. It was definitely not skimpy on the aioli. I would have liked more crostini. \u00a0Maybe if they allow ask for extra. Very flavorful. ENTREE:Sri Lanka Curry - (5 star) \u00a312.00. MUST ORDER!! This dish contained flavored basmati rice, curry sauce, green beans, butternut squash with roasted peanuts. Doesn't that make your mouth water?!?! It was so good, I didn't want to share with the hubby. Packed with flavor. Mushroom and Ale Pie - (3 star) \u00a312.00. This was my hubby's dish. I tried one bite of it and did not want another. Although this is a traditional English dish. It is one that I would pass. The flavor of the mushroom with sauce left a bad taste in my mouth. Since I'm not a fan of phyllo dough. It was a double fail. Don't get me wrong my husband liked the dish. It's an acquired taste. You'll either like it or not. DESSERTChocolate hazelnut brownie with salted caramel sauce and ice cream - (5 star) \u00a36.00. MUST ORDER!!! This is truly a decadent treat, but worth the calories. Overall it was a great dining experience. I would have preferred to have our own table. The other negative item I would say is how close the table are to each other. I understand you want to get more seating, but seriously it's a little ridiculous. People if you need to squeeze between 2 tables please place your behind towards your table. I don't need your rear end all up on my food area!!! As for noise level. Not an intimate place. Especially when you can hear a guy telling his date that he is more than willing to sue his family in court and be loud and proud about it. This is more of a hang out, drink up and eat place.",

I was ecstatic to see a vegetarian restaurant doing so well, there was approx an hour wait when we arrived that Sat night and it was packed all night. It's a great place to bring a date or hang with a group of friends. Although it can get very loud, which is to be expected. Even though it was busy, it felt like our meal wasn't rushed. The atmosphere at their Soho location was much more fun and pleasant than the other spot. Since it is a veg restaurant you need to be mindful of some of their dishes, since it contains eggs or dairy. I loved their beet burger and ceaser lettuce cups the most :)Oh and the chips, can't forget about that!",

I was worried we might have to wait a while since it was 7pm on Friday night, but they were able to seat us right away.We started with the artichoke crostini and spinach ravioli. My cousin and her friend seemed to enjoy the burrito and stir-friend asian vegetables that they got for their main courses, but I thought I was the winner with the risotto cake. The mint was a really nice and unusual touch. The highlight though had to be the desserts. We split the pavlova and the chocolate truffle cake. I think we pretty much licked out plates clean.",

    "text": "My party of three walked around Soho for a while, looking for places for dinner that would satisfy each of our tastes. It was close to 8 by the time we ended up at Mildred's, so we figured, might as well make a stop here.Our food was great - our table had a mix of the risotto cakes, the Ethiopian stew and the veggie burger of the day, plus a side of their sundried tomato cornbread. Can't say I was very impressed with the sweet potato chips - they weren't bad, of course... I just don't get the hype. Overall though everything was quite tasty.Agree with other Yelpers who say that the service isn't so good. Staff are very brusque, which makes them seem snobbish. And a single smile every once in a while would be nice. Also the place was packed (it is a tiny little space, after all) and REALLY loud (the key to making yourself heard is NOT to talk louder than everyone around you, folks - stop perpetuating the problem) but certainly cosy, I guess.Expect to climb over your neighbours, their food and their tables in order to reach yours. DON'T expect to have any sort of private chat, as your partner probably won't be able to hear a word you're saying unless you yell it across the table, thereby including your surrounding diners in the conversation by default.(Collateral damage or a blessing for the eavesdropper in all of us? Well, you'll just have to come to Mildred's and decide for yourself.)P.S. Mildred's offers free WiFi, but you need to have a password, which I think may be listed on a sign somewhere on a wall. Might want to investigate that one.",

When we arrived, the place was overflowing with people busily mowing down on fragrant foods but that didn't stop us from taking our spot in line and waiting our turn to have a seat. The wait was nowhere near as long as I had anticipated given how busy the restaurant was.It was Fall when I visited and I couldn't tear myself away from Mildred's seasonal specials board. I ordered the Pumpkin Coconut Curry Soup (see pics) and Pumpkin Ravioli with Sage & Brown Sugar Butter. My stomach is rumbling just remembering that meal - it was that good. Great portion size and speedy service considering how many people were there. Would return in an instant - I wish we had straight up 'cool'/non-weirdo veg restaurants like this in Toronto!",

    "text": "Mildreds is an institution among vegetarians, and food lovers alike. It's sat in the same spot in Soho for 17 years and is incredibly popular. When i used to think of specifically veggie restaurants I'd imagine skinny women picking at salads, or smug hippies feasting on beans. OK, well you do get some of that, but in the least offensive way. The downside to Mildred's is that you can't book a table and it gets VERY busy, but you can sit/perch in the bar area and wait for a table to become available. Once seated you are presented with an impressive menu, that gives vegetarian and vegan options, and a daily changing specials board. I always have the full three courses when i go, my recommendation being the warm beetroot salad (\u00a35.25) to start, the sweet potato and tomato curry (\u00a38.50) and for desert the profiteroles (\u00a34.75) are the most amazing i have ever tasted. You can sip on a nice organic cider, or they have a vast selection of juices and smoothies. Prices are seriously reasonable, about \u00a320 a head, as although you may leave full up to bursting point, you really feel like you've eaten good food and feel satisfied. They also offer a take away service that is incredibly popular at lunchtimes. Recommended for vegetarians and food lovers.",

    "text": "I have been a couple of times and feel disappointed. I say this as everything I have eaten in there I know I could have made a lot better myself or know of other people that can cook it a lot better. Vegetarian food needn't be boring, I am not someone who has to eat meat at every sitting either but when I pay for food no matter what is in it I want good food. Mildred's is a place I feel was once somewhere wonderful but now is severely lacking on many levels when it comes to the food. I shared some homemade chips and basil mayo. They were ok, but not incredible. I followed this with a teriyaki vegetable and tofu stirfry which was rubbish. I had one singular leaf of pak choi amongst big chunks of onion, leek and broccoli all sat on some brown rice. There needs to be more chinese greeens in here and not just leeks in every mouthful. The tofu was so so, the sauce not punchy enough so the tofu just tasted like lightly soy flavored mush. My beloved had a detox salad with goats cheese which was pleasant but overpriced at 9.00. We decided to share a crumble and custard and I was severely disappointed in this. The custard was soy based but was thin and tasted like ricey dishwater. There was a distinct lack of vanilla. The crumble fruit tasted lovely but it was cold! By the time my meal was over I was enjoying the company of a friend as it was her birthday but inside I felt slightly sad that she hadn't experienced better food especially as it was a birthday meal and she doesn't eat out all the time. But I feel more irritated that a place like Mildred's had such rubbish choices on the menu and meals that could have been a lot better and didn't leave diners feeling they could have made something better themselves. My beloved was especially excited about Mildred's and has been raving about it and she too felt as disappointed with the food as I was. She has now resumed her growling about the fact I went to Viajante too. Seriously if I don't take her soon I am going to have a bitten off ear or will be forced to eat in Mildreds again. Yes the food really is that naff in there right now.",

Straight over to the bar while waiting for friends. Its quite cramped at the front where the bar is but i think that added to the atmosphere. There are some lovely tables that look out of the window on to the street filled with pedestrians mainly, the scale of the street is quite intimate which gives it a specific sense of place.Pushing past the bar the space opens up to the restaurant which has a huge sky-light that makes it look ten time larger. You have to queue for a table but once youre seated just one look of the menu and you know youre in for a goodun. The service, highly attentive and pally type friendly in tune with the relaxed decor too. Food arrived in good time, well presented and clearly put together with great care.thinking back on the experience im changing this review from four as i write to five - there is simply nothing to complain of.",

I brought a couple of omnivore friends with me and they were pretty impressed too. We had to wait for our table for a bit and ended up in a corner table that wasn't the most comfortable, but the food and the organic wine made up for it!We had the Thai tofu as a shared starter, and each one of us had the halloumi burger, the mushroom pie and the tagine: everything beautifully presented and yummy. The portions are pretty big, so we didn't have space for dessert! The only downside was that they took quite a long time to serve the food, but other than that, I would highly recommend this place!",

The ones that say such annoying things as \"A meal isn't complete without meat\" or \"If we didn't eat them, they would eat us\". Take them to Mildred's and watch them quickly change their tune. With dishes such as bangers and mash, the food will feel familiar to even the most seasoned meat eater. The wonderful taste will do the rest of the job of winning them over.Speaking to the meat eaters: Y U no stop eating meat?Other bits and pieces: the restaurant can be extremely busy and you can have to wait for a table. They do not take bookings. Don't expect to have an intimate moment with a date. The table are about an inch apart.",

After deciding to cancel our plans (due to weather, boo!) to go to the Southbank World Street Food Festival, we headed there in hopes we'd get a table.Eureka! There was no wait time and we were seated immediately. But boy...was it cramped! Mildred's is tiiiiiiiiiiiiny, catering to a lot of people at once. I didn't mind because there seemed to be no rush to get up and leave - enjoy your meal at peace, patrons of Mildreds. Have a few drinks and relax.We ordered our drinks. I had a Bellini and my husband had the Daas Blond beer. Our starters were the Mediterranean platter and the chinese fried dumplings. Let me say, it irks me when starters arrive before drinks. That's a basic - it shouldn't be done wrong. I'd like to quench my thirst after a day of shopping, thank you very much.Our starters arrived and I'd have to say, they were a mixed bag. Absolutely skip the Mediterranean platter, which our server said was marginally better than the Mexican platter. The yogurt and beetrot dip was the only savior of the mixture. Everything else seemed like it came off the shelf at Tesco express. Sorry Mildreds - I've seen better. The chinese fried dumplings, however, were FANTASTIC. Served with an amazing sauce and kimchi, we ate it down to the last crumb. If we could have had ten more of those, I'd have been in heaven. Please, please for the love of God, order these if you want to lose your ever-loving mind on a brief trip to flavour town...Mains were an easy choice. I ordered the tomato and basil risotto cake while my husband opted for the burrito (without the guacamole, please). Both came fast and the portions were MASSIVE. Everything was fabulous so I cannot complain there. We said we wouldn't bother with dessert but ordered the chocolate and peanut butter brownie, served warm with ice cream. Oh my. That was a treat. I know brownies are played out but I couldn't help myself, reader. I needed it. There is no better marriage of ingredients than chocolate and peanut butter and this union did it justice.I don't quite get what people are saying about the service being piss-poor. Our server was friendly, helpful and sharp. Our only complaints were the tiny sizes of the tables and the cramped seating. The bill was also a little ridiculous. Over 70 pounds for a few drinks, some starters and mains? Come on! Any restaurant with a burrito as a main course has no right to charge such astronomical prices, in my opinion. The menu changes every so often to go with the season so we will be back! Great meal.",

We asked for 3 small plates to share starters, the waiter gave us 2, saying 3 was a waste. In general, the waitstaff were stressed, forgetful, and rude. One even walked away when I tried to order ice cream. When we asked again, she said the kitchen was closed. Seriously? You can't scoop ice cream?!?! Our food was ok, I've been a vegetarian for nearly 20 years, and found their food lacking; it was ok, but not worth the 30 minute wait. My risotto cake, suggested by the waiter, was in this awful horseradish cream sauce. I love horseradish, but this was tangy in all the wrong ways.Nearing the end of our meal, we were practically forced out as they were closing so early. (Returned to edit this back in--looks like it was removed by Yelp) I'm not sure why my comment in this post was deleted, but, we were the only multi-ethnic table there at Mildred's and they were rude. Seating people in front of us, good served to us well after people who'd ordered after us. In general, I only felt welcome when I (white person) came in by myself. When my friends joined me, Mildred's turned off the charm.Don't waste your time and money with this place.",

What a lovely place to have dinner, despite the bittersweet circumstances. It was former-London Yelp Elite (now San Francisco Yelp Elite) Eliza D's going-away dinner, and she chose Mildred's. A small group of friends, many of which were Yelpers, found ourselves cozied into this cheery restaurant to try our hands at the vegetarian thing.It ended up by complete coincidence that we all ordered something different. I wanted to try everyone's, but didn't, because I didn't want to have to share my burrito, which was hands down the best vegetarian burrito I've ever had, and one of the best Mexican meals I've had in the city. Prices are totally standard for London (I think we ended up splitting it out to \u00a318 each, and we bought a bottle of wine in there), and quite good for the Soho/Picadilly area.I'd highly recommend calling for reservations, even for a small group. We were lucky enough to get in without one for an early Saturday night dinner, but I won't leave it to chance next time.",

There was enough seating to not feel too cramped and the menu looked great.I ordered the main course salad(there's only one) of which I have already forgotten the name of. Namely because it was terrible. For an extra 2 pounds they will give you four pieces of tofu - oh gee thanks! The salad consisted of 85% shredded carrot, 10% shredded beet, 2.5% nuts and seeds, 2.5% lettuce. Literally I could count the pieces of lettuce due to green not exactly blending in with all the orange. The dressing had a good taste albeit a bit too oily. I could not finish the meal having grown sick of carrot after the 20th bite. For a place rated this well I really expected more.Pick up your game Mildred's- a $16 salad needs to leave you completely satisfied- not disgruntled enough to leave a review. 3 stars because the other food items might actually be awesome.",

We arrived around 7pm to a packed room so we started off sitting outside indulging in cava (they were out of prosecco) and chatting. Really nice way to start off.After 30-40 minutes, we were seated. And I have to say, I just love looking at a menu and wanting to eat every single dish. It all sounded so delicious! Not being able to make up our minds, my friend and I decided for 3 starters (!) and two mains. All together we had the beetroot salad, the grilled halloumi and the dumplings for starters, while for mains we decided for the sweet potato curry and Asian stir fry.Everything was great - really good. I have wheat allergies and didn't taste the dumplings, but from what I understood they were divine. The beetroot salad was also quite good, however, the grilled halloumi was out of this world. Yum!I have to admit that we were so stuffed after starters, that we didn't really have the appetite to seriously dig into our mains. Such a shame as they were gorgeous. Another friend joined us later and had some chocolate cake with his cava - and told us it was just OK. We took his word for it, no room left for tasting.I would go back any day! :-D",

We were greeted warmly, ushered in from the never-ending rain (seriously, they are not lying about the rain over here), situated at a two-top near the quaint back area and equipped with water...and a bloody mary for me. It went down like a champ. I figured it was like a smoothie that might take the edge off. It was! I had the middle eastern meze with beetroot yoghurt dip, chilli feta dip, tabouleh, pepper stuffed baby aubergine, rice and mint filled vine leaf and flat bread. It was absolutely incredible. Super fresh, so filling, bright, beautiful veggies. Service got a bit hit or miss as the meal wore on, but nothing to worry over. Just took a lot longer than we had anticipated, but they did get very busy. They are in a prime location. London isn't the easiest place to be a vegan/veggie, eh? Have no fear, make a stop over to Mildreds. I'm dreaming of the beetroot yoghurt dip as I type this. OMG. Get it.",

    "text": "Looking for a nice dinner spot before a Play & Mildred's fit the bill perfectly. Luckily I needed an early dinner to make my show so I got there right before the huge dinner rush - the place was slammed by the time I left Drinky included the best elderflower sparklie drink that was so incredibly yummy - add a bit of vodka & we're talking YUM! I had read a lot of great things about their veggie burger but when I asked the server what she thought was better, she couldn't answer....so I went w/ a more traditional / only-in-London kind of dish instead Mushroom & Ale Pie w/ Chips & Mushy Peas - there was a strong rosemary undertone (or some other herb I can't really say) that gave this an interesting flavor, mixed w/ the Ale. The \"pie\" part was a nice phyllo-esque. Chips were somewhat dry but mixed nicely w/ the peas & \"gravy\" from the pie I was advised before ordering that I'd better like mushrooms b/c this had a lot & let's just say this thing was a *fungal overload* ( in a very good way! ) Huge variety of different mushrooms that added so much flavor complexity due to each soaking up the herbs & gravy in such a different way - amazing Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert was super-delish! Nice & caramely w/ a strong toffee flavor - adding ice cream (or rice cream) would have put this over the top but was still a decadent treat indeed! Lots of other yummy sounding dishes to try & I'll def be back!",

I am giving it four stars because of the brownie and awesome staff/ customer service at the place.",

The staff are always nice and super knowledgeable about the food and drinks available. There are always daily specials and your favourites. The starter I always have is the chargrilled artichoke, I'm salivating just thinking about it! My choice of main dish varies as I like to try new things. My only thumbs down for this place is that they changed their chocolate bombe dessert which was an insanely decadent indulgent 4x chocolate feast of the tastebuds by replacing one of the chocolates with a raspberry coulis. I haven't been able to enjoy any chocolate / rasperry combination since.. But that's me, everyone else seems to really enjoy the raspberry dessert. And it's still by far my all time favourite restaurant in London. So you should visit. Today. And tomorrow. And so on.",

    "text": "Mildred Pierce This Ain't Baby ! Tucked away discreetly on Lexington Street, I've walked past this restaurant several times, without ever being troubled with the urge to visit it. \u00a0But for it being the birthday pick of my BFF Charlie I honestly, would have kept on walking. When I mentioned to my Pop that I was going to a vegetarian restaurant for a friend's birthday, he smiled and reminded me that if there wasn't any meat on my plate for dinner when I was a kid, I would get down from the table and go off and sulk somewhere.I smiled when he said it, but only realised the significance of his story, when I ran my eyes down Mildreds menu. I plumbed for the stir fried Asian vegetables cooked in sesame oil and plum sauce with garlic and ginger. Favoursome yes...but....not enough to make me forget how I much I love meat. For me vegetables represent side dishes to enhance the main event and if I'm brutally honest, vegetarian cooking has to be pretty darned amazing to thrill a die- hard carnivore like myself. If you're a veggie, I'm sure this place will be right up your alley, but for me it was a valiant effort to convince my taste buds, that vegetables as a main meal can rock. Unfortunately, it failed for me. Add to that bland interiors - a pop of warm colour would have raised the tone so easily. The queue - we went on a Friday night and waited so long, so close to the front door, that popped open so often, I didn't manage to get warm during the whole duration of our stay. Even when we were eventually seated at the back of the restaurant. Will I be going back, sorry to say not anytime soon.",
