    "text": "I'm not a steak fan. I'll eat it, but, given a choice, I'd rather go some other place rather than a place which serves huge chunks of meat. Still, I had to come here because a friend of mine wanted to check this off her list prior to leaving London for good. I was really tempted to go for the fillet for health reasons, having started on a new gym and diet routine just a couple of days before, but was persuaded to try the Goodman Ribeye. After all, as I said, I'm not a steak eater, so I might as well try something they're good for while I'm there. The steak was one of the best I'd ever eaten. Unusually enough, it was my third steak in four weeks - one of the others being from Buen Ayre - and when I say it's the best, I really do have a basis for comparison here. And the sauce - stilton - didn't taste of stilton at all. Instead, it was a red wine reduction with stilton and was just simply wonderful. All of us had opted for different sauces, and we were all in agreement that mine was the best (hooray). In terms of sides, the spinach with gruyere sauce, and the mushrooms were fantastic. The chips were nice and thick and crispy as well. Surprisingly, I managed to finish all 400 g of my ribeye (excluding the fat, given my new regime) and even had space for dessert. I went for the baked New York cheesecake and berry compote and was astounded by how light it was. The base was really delicious and crumbly as well. The Everbest Sundae was also really good. In terms of service, it wasn't hurried and the staff generally didn't seem to mind that my table took a long time to order as we were waiting for two other people who took over half an hour to arrive. The restaurant itself seems like a typically posh steakhouse with wood panelled walls, sturdy tables and lighting a tad on the dim side. Our bill came up around \u00a345 per person excluding drinks. Certainly not the cheapest steak place in town, but definitely worth a visit. Reservations are essential. If there isn't a slot available on their online reservation system, try calling and asking. That was what we did, and we managed to get a slot at a very reasonable time even though the online system told us otherwise.",

The venue is sophisticated and delightful, but never pretentious. Our waiter was polite enough to suggest wines that fit our wallet without being snooty at all. And they complimented the meat brilliantly!I ordered the 37 oz porterhouse steak. This was a serious piece of meat and I took my time in savouring every morsel. Started out with the sirloin which was tender and flavoursome! Moved over to the fillet and I was in heaven! Best steakhouse I've been to in London. Tried Sophies the other day and they came in second for flavour.Do try the Argentinian Melbac with your steak!",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Should we go for a burger at Goodman?\". Despite my better instincts, this was apparently not a rhetorical question. I almost did not bother to answer, thinking the affirmation so obvious that I could just turn up. In any case, my tardiness in reporting back on the Goodman burger has more to do with a hectic schedule, cleverly belying my utter raving enthusiasm for what was a sensational evening. Goodman is essentially a steak house. Not of the tawdry, checkered table cloth and grey chewy steak variety you see around Leicester Square - often frequented only by hapless tourists and dodgy stag doos - but a real, classy, clubby New York style steak house (but still with no frills like, say, tablecloths) widely reputed to serve some of the best bits of grilled beef in London. I'm salivating just at the thought of it. However, my visit to Goodman was of a different kind. I had teamed up with some other like minded bloggers and we had one thought in mind (some might even suggest we had but a single thought between us [how cruel]). Our mission: to devour the Goodman burger. A good burger in London is a thing of rare beauty. Hawksmoor's is lovely (more on that in an upcoming rave) and Byron's is also good. But my absolute favourites are both in New York - at Little Owl and Shake Shack respectively. What would Goodman have to offer? A bloody good burger, so it turns out. The hefty 1/2 pound beef patty is thick, dense, rich and smokey. The finely minced patty is nestled nicely in a glistening bun along with the essentials - pickles, tomato, onion and lettuce - I added cheddar. There are optional extras like egg (a la the Aussie burger), fried onion and mushrooms (but why detract from the glory of the top notch beef?), and we shared a side of Bearnaise. The thick cut fries (which some bemoan, but I adore) come as a package deal with the burger for \u00a312. For a price comparison, Byron's (very good) 6oz cheeseburger with fries will set you back \u00a310. This makes Goodman's rather upmarket and sizeable burger, in a classy steak house setting, something of a good deal. (I know some will not see the value in paying 12 quid for a burger and fries, but they're probably unlikely to read my blog too often.) We also shared some delicious creamed spinach with Gruyere, lest our heart rates might be taking it too easy. I am not going to launch into a rating comparison with the Hawksmoor burger, since they are the apples and oranges of the burger world - and to do so would burden me with something of a Sophie's Choice type dilemma. Hawksmoor's burger is a looser and gloopier, unabashedly UK burger, including marrow in the mix. Goodman's half pound patty is extremely dense, finely ground and more uniform. It's more like a thick set version of a traditional US style patty. I loved it, and ate it all (naturally), but not without a subtle popping of the top button. If you can bring yourself to visit Goodman and not have a steak, you're going to be happy with your burger. But the end product is not the only reason I fell head over heels in love with this place. The intense passion for their product, detailed back to front knowledge of it, and dedication to serving their customers the highest quality was the clincher that really won my heart. Although we were not invited to dine, and booked without blogger ID disclosure, the Goodman crew caught wind that we were coming. Under the hospitable eye of manager David Strauss, they prepared for us a starter of beef carpaccio (creamy, melt in the mouth) and a couple of surprise In-N-Out (West Coast USA burger chain) style burgers to divvy up between us (knowing the current moans about the need for someone to adopt and perfect a basic US style greasy burger in London). What absolute champions. This one was layered with 2 thinner patties and oozing slices of melted \"plastic\" cheese (not Kraft, but along those lines). It was also delicious and was sided up with oodles of thin fries smothered in fried onions and thousand island style sauce. Yeah baby. Although potentially heart stopping, it was of course still of the Goodman quality and had less of the grease factor of the greasy US chain burger (which you may or may not view as an ideal thing). A fascinating tour of the kitchens with chef extraordinaire, John Cadieux, revealed the Josper charcoal grills at work, where gigantic, thick steaks were being grilled to perfection at the coal face. Inside the Goodman dry aging room, enormous sides of prime beef lined the shelves, some aged and decayed to the extreme. Walking into it was something of a \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" moment and I was feeling more like Augustus Gloop by the minute. There's both USDA beef, and Scottish grass fed varieties. I would love to back for the steak as soon as possible. John's knowledge of and passion for his",

    "text": "It's no secret that I love a good burger. My love stretches far and wide, and hell I'm even obsessed about meatballs, and really, a patty is just a big flat meatball, no? The answer is yes. End of. Anyway, my number one burger joint in London thus far is Byron Burger, but everyone's been going on about the Hawksmoor burger and the Goodman burger and which one's better manana. Having always come from the school of I-want-to-find-out-for-myself, last week I hit up Goodman Restaurant and ho'd into the Goodman burger. I'd been to Goodman in their pre-burger days, so I already know the meat's good. But how will their burgers fare? Well, you know what, Goodman puts up a damn good fight against Byron, and I'm scared to call the odds but that brioche bun, a classic towering fluffy brioche bun, almost pushes it over the edge, straight into the winner's circle. Almost. Goodman's patty is also bigger, fatter and juicier and cooked a deliciously perfect medium-rare, better than Byron's 6 oz patty. But Byron has that pickle, which I adore and Goodman, well teeny tiny pickles and sometimes, boys and girls, size does matter. Aside from the pickle, Byron's burgers are also circa \u00a37 which even with chips is a few pounds less than Goodman's \u00a312 (with chips). sigh Maybe I ought to love them all equally. Like my little burger babies. Yep. How about this: If you're just after a simple burger, nothing fancy and possibly not even chips, then definitely go to Byron. But should you be after a schmancier meal, like you kinda wanna impress someone with a swish dinner but y'know showing you're all down to earth and stuff and you eat burgers, Goodman is probably the way to go. But I do hate to choose I mean, they are my burger babies now and I love them equally! Honest!",

We have a mission to identify the best steak in London, drink some great wine and beer, make friends but most of all eat great meat. Goodmans ticks all the boxes, quality of meat, service and atmosphere. Im normally pretty extensive in my reviews but theres a few things about Goodmans that I dont want to shout about as there special and I know what will happen if I do! I will say that steak selection is very, very good and price is about \u00a350 per head with wine. Although you could spend a lot more but not much less! Clients as with most steak houses are about 80% male although the mould is being broken a little already here. There are always suits in here but also people in there casuals having a good night out. Its not too loud although Its not a first date place either! Steak house and first....NO...just no.. Sauces are great, salads good, drinks good, wine great (has my fav bottle in London).. But its all about the steak here! Im in the process of adding about 20 other steak house reviews that I hope to get up over then next month..",

OK I know I was being selfish and wanted to eat Steak for my birthday :-) Whenever I go to food places that are established and supposed to know about the food I always advise for staff to recommend. Started off with Rose and that as ever was reliable nicely chilled and could have drunk by the Pint. We were shown the meat plate and thought WOW I want the nicest and biggest. They had meat cuts from Australia and the US here. Recommended an Australian Fillet that was marinated in Cajun spices for 7 hours. This was new to the menu. We ordered the chips, mushroom and Honey Glazed Carrots that were tasty. Chips were crispy and tasty. My lovely lady had the Salmon which she thought was equally as good as my steak. The Steak for sure was tasty and the fat had oozed to the sides making it tender and nice and pink in the middle. I had the Silton sauce with a beef stock blended and loved it. I could have taken it home. You do not need to have a starter or desert here as the Mains do the job perfectly. The restaurant is pefect for dinner parties and not a romantic venue. We left after I was treated and the bill came just under 80 quid. This is a good price for Maddox Street and good food for 2.",

    "text": "Without doubt in the top two steak restaurants in London, along with Hawksmoor. Steaks are big, well aged and charred to perfection by the Josper grill. To maximise enjoyment order a selection of steaks for the table, getting some corn fed USDA, some grass fed from these shores and, if you can, a mix of dry (on the bone) and wet (off the bone) aged. These bits of beef really are special. On the topic of beef their burger is arguably the best in London, made from the same aged meat as their steaks, incorporating fatty offcuts from the joints. It's big, bloody (if you order it right) and smoky. The price doesn't change when you add toppings so for \u00a312 you can get a cheese and bacon burger with chips, something many of the gourmet burger chains won't do for that price. Sides are good too, ranging from chips, through truffle oil macaroni cheese, to rich, creamed spinach. The wine list is big with some really nice stuff at the cheaper end, at around \u00a326 the Don David Malbec is perfect with the red meat.",

Before dessert we got a tour of their drying fridge where they hang the Irish beef and also were shown the oven they use a Spanish brand josper. As well as the beef I had the 'unravioli' to start and the chocolate dessert with a lovely amulys, and the man had a Russian beer and we shared a bottle of the house red(free if you order two courses in January).

When I first arrived I was being pressured by my boss to indulge in the 800g Porterhouse, but based on how he said he felt when he tried to tackle that illusive unicorn, I went with the sensible option of the 400g Goodman T-bone. Thank god I did. We also ordered a selection of veg and enough bernaise sauce drown that kid at school that needed the stick to help him negotiate the shallow end. We also ordered a stonking bottle of wine, the Malbec (30 nuggets a bottle). When the food arrived I didn't get what I usually get at steak restaurants, a massive wave of food envy. This time that condition was kelpt well and truly in the box and I was 100% satisfied with my decision. The meat looked fantastic and I'm even more pleased to report that it was precisely how I had asked for it to be cooked; medium rare, verging more on the side of rare. It was soft, tender and dangerously tasty. There was no way I was sharing. The accompaniments were all fantastic. Spinach with goats cheese, new potatoes, honey carrots and truffle fries (fries covered in truffle oil - incred) all of which were a healthy 4 squirrels each. I think the reason Goodman deserves a massive high five and ass grab is because unlike Gaucho, the atmosphere is one that I much preferred. Much more relaxed and less pretentious. There was also more light. Sounds odd, but whenever I go to Gaucho I can barely see a thing. It's like entering a morgue. Goodman is light, airy and it generates a good buzz around the tables. The staff are friendly and accommodating without getting in the way. Our waiter worked with all the German precision of a BMW which was fantastic. I like that in a waiter. \u00a0We finished off with a round of puddings and cheese, all in the region on about 6 nuggets each. After a coffee I honestly felt like I was going to give birth to a meaty/chocolaty baby. Totally worth it though. It's as expensive as they come, but for the quality of the experience I would say that if you need a place to go for some of the finest food in London... look no further. \u00a0You have been warned. I like meat. Facteezy.",

There is also always a great choice for meat lovers, from Aberdeen Angus, to Irish to USDA and Australian Kobe (Wagyu) so is fun going as a group and tasting a bit of cattle from different parts of the world.",

I would like to come back one day to try the steak but for this visit it was all about the burger. Of course it didn't stop me from having the white onion soup as a started (though I really shouldn't have). The soup was OK but I can actually make a better one myself. It didn't have the depth to it that I was expecting and it wasn't thick enough. Main course was the burger which was cooked to perfection. Lovely light bread, tomato and pickles. I added bacon and cheese which was free of charge, you can add any of the extras to the burger without paying extra. The burger as others have said is quite compact, very dense patty but well cooked. I can't deny it's a really good burger but I can't honestly say it's better than the Hawksmoor one and for the price I would definitely consider Byron instead. It did leave me utterly stuffed afterwards, but not stuffed enough to finish my wine and ordering the selection of sorbets though.",

Anyway walking in told fully booked but lucky there was space in the bar to have a meal. The resturant was empty when we walked in but did start to get busy. I did comment that I bet we finish and leave and there will still be a few empty tables and I was right so I do question thier booking policy a little when being a new client we were not felt very welcome. Bar staff that served us made up for this and the lunchtime menu I think was food value with steak and chicken options to name just two. Food was great and served up hot and very quickly. Perfect for a quick lunch. Decor was nice and classic. Bill came in around \u00a355 for two but we did not have wine. But I think reasonable as it was very filling. I would go again but I am weary about the booking and walk in availability so I would have a backup planned just in case.",

It was more of the quality than the cooking because the flavors were delicious. \u00a0It just was not a pleasure to eat.. When I go to a steakhouse that charges upwards of $30 per piece of meat, I expect quality meat.. just sayin...!!! \u00a0The server seemed to disappear once the food came, probably because he knew we were not feeling the food.. The atmosphere was cool, their wine list was OK, but a little overpriced for the selections. \u00a0I was in a beer mood that day, which apparently sent the message that I perhaps didnt know what good meat was since I preferred that to their underqualified pretentious wine list. \u00a0Oh well, wont be back, but here is my two cents.",

The interior was cozy in a classy man cave-ish sort of way, all darkwoods and leather backed banquets and chairs. The vibe was casual.Our server was knowledgeable & cheerful and let us choose select cuts of meat she brought to us on a chopping block, which I thought was pretty neat. The selections are of \u00a0select UK and US meats, and we joked with the server \"Where's the Canadian beef?\" Upon finding out we were from Toronto the server was pleased to introduce us to the Head Chef John, \u00a0who is also Canadian. \u00a0John was kind enough to give us a tour of the kitchen and show the meat dry ageing and explain the process of selecting the best beef. I was surprised at how deliciously fragrant the meat smelled! Who knew uncooked meat could smell this good! \u00a0Once we had our tour we knew we were in good hands and in for some great steak! \u00a0To start I had the rocket salad with parmesan followed by the 200gram t-bone steak while my hubby had the 350 gram New York Sirloin, he originally wanted the 400gm Goodman Rib Eye but that was sold out! \u00a0The steak was juicy and savoury with the perfect measure of smokiness. \u00a0My husband couldn't speak but all the backward eye-rolling told me either he was in steak heaven or slipping into steak induced coma.I'd been to many steakeries in T.O. (Ruth's Chris, Le Bifteque, Barbarians, Tom Jones) but I'd never had steak like I did at Goodman's and it was very well worth crossing the pond for it!!!",

    "text": "Dark wood? Check. Leather banquettes? Check. Good lookin' hunks of huge marbled steak? Oh most definitely yes. In Goodman, a chunk of prime gourmet US of A has landed in the middle of good ol' London town. Now we may mock spray on cheese and Kraft. But y'know, we have deep fried Mars Bars and Wimpey so there's no point us saddling up that high horse. And while it may not be haute cuisine, American's take their steak very seriously indeed. Goodman is well and truly grounded in this tradition. Knowing this I was expecting something good - no, great - when it came to the steak. From the moment the waiter introduced us to an attractive gathering of meaty slabs, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. USDA corn fed New York strip steak, Irish grass fed ribeye, a sirloin from Scottish Black Angus, this was an international steak summit of the very highest calibre. But you know something? I didn't go for a steak. Why? It was very expensive - a rib eye was around the \u00a330 mark before you think about sides - and I had spotted the burger. Now the Twitterati have been tweeting loud and long about burgers recently and I had heard that Goodman's made one of London's best. And it was only \u00a312 and came with chips. Gift horses and mouths sprang to mind. This was a bargin. And it was, it really was. But before burgers came starters. They ranged from the good (seafood risotto - worthy but dull) to the great (herring, more on that in a minute). Chicken liver & foie gras was smooth, wobbly and lightly livery. Very tasty. Tiger prawn tempura was good, and really lifted by the merest hint of spice. But the Russian style sweet herring, oh my word, the herring. That was seriously good. Soused in a light sweet and gently sharp pickle it tingled perfectly on the tongue and had a delicate sea-inflected flavour. Eaten with slender slivers of dark rye bread and cornichons, it was the star. The burger was American in style it, an evenly shaped ground beef patty, and moist without being greasy. It was intensely beefy and had been cooked to perfection. Slightly pink and just juicy enough. A fine burger indeed. My only complaint was that I found the bun a little dry, but I think that's more personal preference than kitchen fault. And the chips were fabulous. The rib eye - I fliched a taste from a friend - was very good, if a little unevenly cooked. Rare at one end, and medium at the other. It was testament to the quality of the meat that this didn't matter. It was full of taste with a lightly melting texture. Desserts were decent, but not spectacular. And so. while some of the extras didn't live up to billing, the meat was fabulous. The pricing is a bit uneven, an absolute bargin of a burger and great, but expensive, steak. I'd come here again, but probably stick to the set menu or the burger. And the herring.",

The main detractor of this burger is that it is too tall and it is a struggle to hold together. Goodman is a great restaurant and definitely a place to be seen. If you're out for a shopping trip on Regent Street and need to add some manliness into the evening stop in at Goodman for a burger and beer.",

California, I really miss eating a good steak which is damn hard to find in London.I am happy to say Goodman has USDA cuts and tastes just like I know a good steak should. There are a few locations in London. I've also been to the Canary Warf restaurant, but think the Mayfair branch is the best for service and steak grilling consistency. The burger is also an outstanding choice: It's juicy and tastes like a steak -- and thier chips that are served along side the burger are perfect squared blocks of creamy potato on the inside and crispy outside.The restaurants are owned by Russians but they seem to have nailed that American steak experience - I've been to the Goodman in Kiev and it's easily one of the best places for a steak there as well. The owners have branched out a bit further in London opening a place called 'Burger & Lobster' which is a casual dining spot where you can get a lobster roll or their delicious burger. I've been meaning to check it out too, except there is always a long queue and I hate lines.",

Last night I sat at the bar and sampled their finest rum accompanied by the creamiest of mac and cheeses, sprinkled with truffle oil and smelling heavenly, creamed spinach with Gruyere (which together with the mac was a dream of a mouthful) and truffle chips. The chips, chunky soft potato and perfectly crisp on the outside, although delicious did lack some truffle infusion....AND that's just the sides.... the Goodman burger- priced at \u00a313 no frills with extra for bacon, cheese etc is a big, flavorsome, meaty patty, sandwiched between an almost brioche style bun. Good quality and taste. I have yet to sample steaks at the famous steak house...perhaps next time....",

I came here after a recommendation from a friend and i have to say it is one of the best places for steaks after Gaucho. The prices are alot more reasonable than most steak places in London. The only negative point i found was the lack of space as there were too many people in the restaurant and it was a but noisy. Nevertheless i recommend going here for steaks and please do try the truffle oil chips amazing.Booking in advance is also advised.",

    "text": "Do you think it's wrong to make recommendation to a place if you have never been before? Well that's what I had done with Goodman as a friend was asking for a nice restaurant and based on the number of opinions that I had that Goodman was the place for a steak, then I just went with my gut feeling and made the recommendation. So my friend never went, but finally found an excuse to surprise my girlfriend with a nice evening out and how pleasantly surprised we were. Foe me, there hasn't been many restaurants in recent times that have stood out and left a mental after taste a few days after.... however a week after going.. both myself and my girlfriend have been craving the premium cuts of meat offered at Goodman which is also cooked with people who know what medium rare is. Whilst the steaks come with sauces, they really didn't need them. The steak had authentic flavours which were complimented by the tasty sides - try the macaroni and cheese which to us seem like a strange combo but definitely worked. If you like a good steak then try Goucho but if you love a excellent premium cut steak with attentive friendly service in a more rustic classy but casual environment then Goodman is your best bet.",

It feels luxurious in here.The staff were excellent. Really fantastic service. The wait staff seem to be dressed in chef whites, which can be a little confusing to begin with, but they know what they're talking about.The steak was very good. I had a Porterhouse steak and I'm informed I was pulling some very happy and pleasurable faces upon each bite. That's a solid testament right there.The sides almost stole the show - the garlic mushrooms were just incredible. Some of the best carrots I've ever tasted, mac and cheese a rare treat, and the creamed spinach was a pleasure. Of the sauces we opted for, the pepper sauce was ridiculously good.Why not 5 stars? Because we've had better. Just. Hawksmoor, Buen Ayre (albeit a different experience) and Gaucho pip Goodmans I think. But I was very impressed and very happy. If I'd been a steak-house virgin, I'd no doubt be bleating about it and trying to hack the Yelp website to allow 6 stars!",

First time, I went with the burger (adding cheese, bacon, and fried egg, of course), and it is hands down the best burger in London. Also, at 12 pounds, very reasonably priced!Second time was for a work dinner, and so steak was a must. Took down a one kilogram wing rib, cooked to medium perfectly, with a nciely made bernaise on the side. Fantastic fries to accompany (don't waste you extra pound on the truffle fries), and the mac & cheese is a great palate cleanser (sort of) throughout the meal.With regard to service, it is attentive but not obsequious. My colleagues questions were answered efficiently (what is wet aging?) and whatever else we needed came in a hurry.If you're going for steak, its not so cheap (my wing rib was 62 pounds), but I have not had a steak elsewhere in town (all at the same price point) that even compares. Highly recommend, and I will be back soon!",

More modern than other places in the area, too, which makes it feel slightly more casual.Food: In a word, good. Nothing I've had here has truly blown my mind, but I've never left unsatisfied. The steaks are some of the best you'll find in the area (Maze Grill, by Grosvenor Square, might rival it, but I personally preferred Goodman's both for taste and value for money). I've had fish here a couple of times and the salmon was delicious, with a fantastic crispy skin. I've been here several times over the past 18 months and the quality overall has been consistently high.Service: I wish it was as good as the food. Service can be inattentive, especially after the mains have been served--I've had to flag down waiters for water refills, for coffee, for the bill--not acceptable in this kind of restaurant. However, I'd like to caveat this by saying I've only really noticed this at the end of a meal--when you're ordering and getting your mains, everything's fine, it's just after that service falls off. A bit of a mystery, but a minor annoyance overall.Value: Roughly on par with other spots, and definitely good for the area. Worth a visit if you love steak or are looking for a consistently good place for a business lunch in the area.",

    "text": "We'd been talking about going to Hawksmoor for ages, then I discovered Goodman and after comparing reviews there was nothing between them. They have similar menus and prices and both claim to have the best steak in London but for whatever reason we decided to give Goodman a shot. All of Goodman's meat is dry-aged on site in a temperature-controlled, dehumidified environment and then cooked in specially imported charcoal ovens at 375-400\u00b0C using three types of wood from sustainable sources including charcoal from Cornwall and Kent and charcoal from South America.We looked to 'The Cut' blackboard to see what was available and decided on the 600g USDA Angus, 150 day corn fed Bone In Rib-Eye (\u00a342) and a 350g New York Sirloin (\u00a330) with all the sauces - b\u00e9arnaise, pepper & stilton. We were advised to have the rib-eye cooked to medium to make sure the fat would melt and add to the flavour and texture and ordered the sirloin at our normal preference - medium-rare.The selection of side dishes is excellent at Goodman Mayfair. There are plenty of veg options like honey & ginger glazed carrots and creamed spinach as well as heavier options such as mac & cheese with truffle sauce and creamy mash potato. We went for a portion of Beef Dripping Chips (\u00a35.50) which came with a little dish of beef dripping salt to chuck over them and some fresh Green Beans saut\u00e9ed off with some shallot (\u00a34) which were both very good.",

The best thing is you can get cheese, caramelised onions, bacon, fried egg all for free - free toppings is always music to my ears. I probably wouldn't add all the extras onto the burger though...clashing flavours!I don't think it's fair to compare Hawksmoor v Goodman because both do fabulous steaks. The lunch menu at Goodman is such a good deal - eg: beef carpaccio for \u00a35, and steak/fries for \u00a315-16 (can't remember exactly but it's around that price point). I will say though that the Goodman burger beats Hawksmoor's any day in my books. Its locations in the City/Mayfair draws in predominantely business-suited clientele. When I dined, it was funny to see that 90% of diners in a packed restaurant were suited men - I felt a bit out of place! Nevertheless, service is very attentive, and the food can't be faulted. A wide variety of cuts and there's beef from literally around the world - American and home-grown. The restaurant is a bit cramped (tables are close together) but otherwise no complaints from me.PS: the thick hand cut chips are so addictive, and I'd also personally recommend the mac/cheese with truffle sauce. As a Canadian, I have to say that I'm very happy and a bit surprised to see poutine on the menu as a side - points from me!",

The spiel about the various meat choices is almost endless but the young lady who presented it could not have been more helpful. Fantastic selection of meats, sides, \u00a0wines and desserts from reasonable prices to some high end choices for those with a fatter wallet but it seems the quality is never below outstanding!Everything was cooked and presented with perfection, my Goodman Ribeye was a super succulent delight, the beef dripping chips and truffle fries beyond delicious and the sample of New york Sirloin, stolen from my girlfriend's plate, also fantastic. The cookie sundae dessert was quite stunning, i have to say it is the finest sundae i think i have ever had (and i have had many). Other peoples meals also looked wonderful, incredible looking lobster and steaks passing us every few minutes and some awesome sharing dishes too.The waitresses caught wind that i was there for my birthday and we did not make it obvious, \u00a0My dessert was thus delivered with a happy birthday added to my plate in chocolate sauce, a candle on top and they sang Happy Birthday also, a wonderful and unexpected touch to an already wonderful experience. I felt like the staff were our friends by half way through the evening laughing and joking with us and a Bristolian union was also discovered with another waitress but their friendliness never invasive or encroached on our evening at all, merely enhanced it. \u00a0We were later treated to a tour of the kitchen from the head chef which was a great experience with some interesting facts, and eye opening visuals (the meat fridge) another delightful surprise. I am not sure i can improve on such a wonderful evening even if we were to visit Goodman again, we heavily hinted to all involved a branch should be opened in Bristol as soon as possible. If the prices worry you be assured it is well worth the money, an impressive high class restaurant to easily impress clients if wanted or an enjoyable classy steak house with a more down to earth feel if you wish, i have not seen this mix under one roof before a perfect all rounder. My mouth is still watering at the thought of each dish, a thank you to all at Goodman Maddox st, a real birthday treat and unbeatable restaurant experience! I am still wondering if this review understates it all, it was that good!NB I am normally far from easily pleased!",

    "text": "Goodman is a legit steak house!I'd been wanting to go for ages, and when my parents came to town and offered to take us to dinner, I booked Goodman. The ambiance is upscale, and while I'm sure they would prefer people to be dressed more smarty, it seems like it's a bit casual there as well. The servers were all incredibly friendly and always coming by to see if we were okay with drinks.I needed a bit of a drink to calm down when I arrived so ordered the bartender's special, The Derby. Delicious (but strong) drink to start the meal. They're more than willing to bring the cuts of meat over to the table to show you what you'll be ordering. They have some regular cuts of steak on the menu, but they also have a few special cuts for the evening which are located on various chalkboards around the restaurant. They do both American corn-fed beef and European grass-fed beef. We opted for the grass-fed bone-in rib-eyes and a few sides.I also had the seared foie gras starter. It was fantastic. The foie gras was really well seared and it was served with figs and truffle honey (I love truffle honey). The beef was really well cooked. Perfectly medium rare (as a rib eye needs to be to cook the fat) and they served with a variety of sauces. My favorite was the Bearnaise. Super duper delicious. The pepper sauce was really peppery. The only letdown was the Stilton wine sauce. Wasn't Stilton-y enough for me. We got steamed spinach (perfectly reasonable), beef dripping chips (awesome) and truffle mac and cheese (amazing) as sides. My parents got the chocolate tart dessert and it was oozing chocolate. We ordered the cheese and there were some pretty tasty cheeses there.All in all, it's probably the best steak I've had in London. Next time I have the hankering for an expensive steak dinner, Goodman will be at the top of my list!",

I've been searching for the perfect one for over a year (since I discovered my passion for MEAT) and I found it.Bone in rib eye, ladies and gentlemen at Goodmans - is an absolute perfection. When I had my first bite I couldn't believe what I tasted - juicy, slightly smokey and very fresh. Perfection.Also, do try the Russian starter - cold herring - it is lovely! Surprisingly sweet and refreshing. It has a bit of an informal setting, no pretentiousness - just pure meaty enjoyment.Service is good and attentive.",

The vibe of the restaurant is perfect: nice but not pretentious. The service was fantastic. We were having trouble seeing the daily specials on the board on the wall so our server literally brought one of the large chalkboards to our table. He even explained the differences between each cut and origin (which was useful!)We ordered a large USDA bone in ribeye to share. I would say it was slightly under cooked for medium rare, but only very very slightly. It was still absolutely delicious! We also ordered the mac and cheese, beef dripping chips, and spinach. All three were incredibly good but I would highly recommend the mac and cheese with truffle and Parmesan. I'm not exaggerating when I say it probably deserves 5 stars on its own.The wine selection is also pretty good! Overall, it was a lovely dinner and I can't wait until our next visit!",

It was a big cut but I ate everything ! The sides were good as well, my favorite one was the cheesy spinach.I recommend this place for good meat lovers.

I had a rib wing, which was described as an in-bone ribeye cut near the sirloin section, so a little less fatty than a typical ribeye. \u00a0It was good, to me tasted more like a regular aged ribeye, but not one of my best steaks ever.Overall a very good meal but my expectations were so high can only give it a 4.",

    "text": "Well then, this was for me at least a real turn up for the books. It's not that I dislike the idea of a steak restaurant.....I mean I LOVE STEAK, but I cook steak really well at home just how I like it.At the end of a day out with some yelpers last weekend we found ourselves here for dinner. Reading the menu you can pay anything from \u00a340 to \u00a3200 for a steak..daaaaaamn! Reading a little further they also had other options lamb, burger and a few others. Burger for \u00a316 are you mad? But I thought, wait a minute, if they are making burgers from the off cuts from all that expensive steak this could be one hell of a burger. I noticed on the steak options there was an add on of fois gras butter....a plan was hatched!Could I....could it be done? Could I have the burger with this butter of the Devine smeared on top? Well it turns out I could and I did and it was awesome!!!My dining chums were all equally happy with their choices, the lamb which I tried a bit of was spectacular and the ribeye steak was buttery and delicious!One thing that might have cost them a star was he fact they well lost our order and we waiting over an hour to be served, what saved them was the exceptional service from the waitress and manager who picked up on the error without us saying anything and brought us a bottle of wine on the house.All in all a great dining experience!",

    "text": "Wow... Where to start with Goodman?Do I start with the great service or do I start with how great the food is? Do I first of all tell you how each of the dishes from the Shrimp tempura, lamb, steak to the mac and cheese tasted like a piece of heaven if heaven was edible?I had been almost \"stalking\" Goodman on instagram for a while and couldn't wait for the day I would try their food. It was after pay day, luckily, when I went here after a Yelp event with some of my great Yelp friends and I will tell you this, what a great experience! We did a \"walk in\" and were seated at a table with no hesitation. We started off with a bottle of White Wine (Portuguese) which was finely chilled, glass sweating, my taste buds craving more with each sip. The service was highly professional at Goodman. Both Leanne (manager) and Leonie (waitress) were very attentive and when our food was taking a bit longer than usual to arrive at the table, Leanne offered us a complimentary bottle of wine which we could not refuse! Again, the wine was exquisite. Before ordering our food, Leonie talked us through all the different types of steaks and how each one would taste differently. I had the HERDWICK LAMB, BARNSLEY CHOP, PEA AND MINT PUREE, LAMB JUS which was very tasty. One bite into the lamb and I literally collapsed on the table. It was tender, flavorful and definitely worth the choice. For what it was, \u00a317 seems like a bargain! I had a taste (maybe a fork or 5) of the Mac and Cheese..... OMG! The devil's food but taste of an Angel! I could not have been more pleased with the overall experience at Goodman. I went home and bragged all about it. I will definitely be back. Although it has to be at a time I can afford to order a \u00a360 steak. Ha-ha! Thank you Leonie and Leanne!",

We arrived and got a table straight away even on a busy Saturday, which straightaway wins points for me. The menu was decent, not loads of choice for those non steak eaters, but what choices they did have, sounded yummy! Me being me, went for the prawns! Great decision! The prawn tempura was cooked to perfection and complemented with avocado and mango salsa! Oh my I'm still dreaming about how good this was! Mmmm! The steaks were pretty much ordered by the rest of my group and went down great! I have give a special shout out for the awesome Mac and cheese.. Seriously no words, food coma worthy, it was so good! Service wise it was exemplary, couldn't fault it! We'd been waiting a while, but when you're in good company you don't notice so much and the lovely manager, Leanne brought us a complimentary bottle of wine, which I thought was a lovely touch. Our main server, Leonie was a gem too, spending a while going through the menu and rising separate payments from us all! Serious massive shout out for this place, if you haven't been yet put it on your list for 2016, it's a must visit!",

    "text": "Having dined at this restaurant with Jurgen, Livi and Serena, I agree, this food is amazing. The service was great - a lot of banter with the waitress and good advice as to what to order and how it was cooked. The food was expertly cooked, they know what they are doing, the steak, oh my god. Didn't need a steak knife to get through this meat. the side of mac and cheese was also brilliant. At \u00a35 for the side, but you get a HUGE bowl.So they did forget our order but when they realised, they fixed it, straight away. They informed us, and already had a way of fixing it and a timeline as to what they were going to do. Fantastic, just the kind of service that this place and others should have.The steaks aren't cheap but you are paying for so much more, you could go for the other options, but at least one person on the table should do the steak so that you can all experience it.This is a special restaurant, not a place you should go everyday but for occasions that warrant it. I will be returning! Thanks to Leanne and Leonie who helped us out.",

The interior is classy and cosy but honestly the only thing I can focus on is the tastiest steaks. Meat lovers need to come by.",

    "text": "Goodman's exceeded my expectations by some way. Yes, I've read the reviews, I've heard the hype and built it up in my mind.The menu is perfect in size with delicious sides to pick from and a separate board of cuts of the day. We shared a starter of tempura prawns. Huge juicy prawns in crunchy batter. Absolutely perfect, never had prawns so well cooked in tempura.Then I had a ribeye steak and my friend had the fillet. Both were perfectly cooked and insanely good. We shared sides: triple cooked chips, hand-cut chips, creamed spinach and...........truffled...........mac&cheese. Lordy, if there's anything I'd like to die after eating, it's this. Creamy, trufflely, soft, rich, silky, yummy, most delicious thing ever. That good. The triple cooked chips were excellent, as was the spinach but the hand-cut chips were more like wedges in texture and it just wasn't what we wanted with our steak. Personal choice. The whole meal came together perfectly, the amazing, charred steak, the soft spinach and mac&cheese, the crunchy chips, totally gorgeous, high quality, beautiful meal.The only negative I can give and it's barely worth noting is that bearnaise sauce was not to my taste and actually, because everything is so flavourful, you don't need sauce. At this point, we were full to the tops of our heads and beyond. But we still had dessert. Nougat dessert with banana sorbet was well thought out in taste and presentation. The cr\u00e8me brulee was executed well.Overall, this place is unforgettable. The service is kind, knowledgeable and helpful. The restaurant is charming and the food is impeccable. It's the perfect place for a steak lover and a celebration. No, it's not cheap but value for money is good here and I can't see anyone leaving disappointed. I'm also going to briefly say that Hawksmoor is a poor little brother in comparison in every way. Their service is too cool to care, their mac&cheese is disappointing and the steaks, not as good. The only thing I can see that's better at Hawksmoor than here is the soft drinks and cocktail list. I'm taking down their rating as a result and am forever converted to Goodman's.",
