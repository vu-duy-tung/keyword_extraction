The famous green mustard sauce tastes slightly different from the original in Paris but still very tasty. The red house wine is a lovely treat. And once you had one of those amazing desserts you know you are hooked forever.Enjoy!!",

When you sit down, you get a starter salad with walnuts and some bread. Once that's done, you'll be served steak with some amazing sauce and seriously yummy fries. My favourite part is when they come back for a second round and give you more steak and slather it with more sauce. My kind of heaven. Dessert is where you can pick what you want, traditional French desserts like creme brulee, profiteroles or sorbet. I went with the Vacherin, a towering mound of meringue, ice-cream and chocolate sauce. You get lots of jealous looks too. Prices are fairly reasonable - all up I paid about \u00a330 (includes 1 glass of wine and dessert). This place makes me a really happy bunny - I couldn't stop grinning like an idiot throughout the meal. Sooo going again.",

It was pretty good..not sure what they hype is though. The salad was GOOD...very interesting wasabi vinegarette..i likey. So not much else to say, set menu for 20 GBP - salad, steak and fries (2 servings), dessert will cost u more than the set 20 GBP, but none of them were more than 5 GBP. \u00a0(I had good creme bruelee - perfect for one). The half bottle wine that I bought...not sure it's what everyone says it is..it's ALRIGHT..but not great for 9 GBP. meah.Hey..my first London review! yes!!",

I lived in Marylebone for sometime and was always very surprised by the ques of people waiting to eat here. If you are a steak fan and looking for great meat this is not the place to go. The meat is ok, covered in a \"secret\" special source that I managed to knock up my kitchen 2 days later to as near as perfect. The service is ok, but they are a high volume restaurant, dont expect to stay to long! They do, what they do, very, very well but I still dont understand the endless Ques! What is more surprising is that directly opposite you have what is widely regarded as the best fish and chip restaurant in London, the Gun hidden behind the high street and the Autre Pied 2 mins away, which in my book knock spots of this place.... Oh and its not that im ignoring the providores its just that if you dont want to Que for dinner then I wouldnt go (sunday breakfast used to amazing, then the papers ran an article on it and you now Que for hour to get)...

I promise, you will be licking your fingers afterwards!! They also have very tasty dessert list (alebit a small one) to finish of the evening with. This restaurant is simply the most addictive restaurant I have been to in London and there are only 4 of them worldwide, including Paris, New York and Dubai. I have also been to the one in Paris and it is exactly the same in terms of food testiness and set up! Cannot recommend highly enough!",

    "text": "Sometimes you want a Heston-type meal, prepared with all sorts of whizzy science-lab-like techniques plated with impeccable artistry on a piece of slate or a board or something that seems stylish at the time. And sometimes you want a well-prepared comforting meal on a plate.Relais does a good rendition of the latter, serving a well-crafted and comforting meal that always leaves me feeling like my soul has gotten a tiny bit of nourishment on top of the healthy meal I've just enjoyed.It's decent value and for your money you'll have a good meal. You won't spend a lot of time pouring over the menu because it's basically steak. And frites. They're brought to you in two batches (so you don't end your meal with cold frites) with a highly addictive and mysterious secret sauce. The service could be warmer - they certainly don't aim to connect with you - \u00a0but the food itself always seems to tick the boxes, done exactly as it should be done, served in just the right amounts at the right time.For those of you visiting from the States, I'll leave two comments based on previous reviews and I'll preface those comments by saying I also am from (Gasp! Horror!) Texas.1. This may seem like an expensive meal because of the exchange rate but actually by London standards it's not and is actually great value.2. You can't compare Relais to places in the states (or in London) that are or sell themselves as high-end. That's not what this place is about. It's a steak frites place, not the latest and greatest high-priced steakhouse. Will Relais serve you the best steak you've ever had? Nope. Will they serve you a well-prepared meal and bring you back for more? Yup.",

That's 30 mins before closing time.Hmm this will be hard to rate but here is my go at it:3* cut of meat. 3* The green sauce, my guess, is a mixture of mustard and some green herb that reminds me of a tartier, more reduced curry mussamam for some odd reason. 4* at my medium meat. Pink with occasional hints of red liquid.4* for menu choice. Can't beat \"the only thing you get to decide on is how you want your meat cooked\". Love the simplicity of it.5* on the way its served. The second serving with the 1/3 meat + fresh extra crispy frites is a great idea. I was getting full but the crunch of the fresh frites made me wanna finish my meal up.5* on the le profiteroles du chocolate- at my server's recommendation when I asked for something chocolaty thats not too sweet. Its thin choux pastry with vanilla ice cream, drenched in melted dark chocolate sauce and almond slices. (Note: my mouth is drooling as I am writing the description. I want it again!) The sensation of hot and cold in your mouth makes it extra yummy.6* for cute french maids in french maid outfits with matching cute personalities6* for service level and the way the servers handled drama. There was an overly boisterous drunk dude that stood up and started clapping at his table. Moments later he fell off his seat, hitting the customer behind me. 3 of the servers came and talked to him. One talked to him, the other two reassured the surrounding diners. 15 mins later, he started banging on the table really loudly several times and was extremely loud in his proclamations. My server went over to placate him. He instantly had his hand around her waist and as they talked, his hand went to her butt! She calmly finished talking to him and deftly maneuvered his hand away. I would have gave him a resounding punch or a kick in the groin if I was in her shoes. Anyway.. its a nice experience overall",

We got there and saw a line out front waiting to get in. Unfortunately, everyone had to wait on it, both large and small groups. This was a bit disappointing since sometimes a party of two can get seated quickly in a crowded venue. Anyway we waited and it wasn't the end of the world.Once we got seated, everything was great. There isn't much of a selection here as I think the only things you can get as a main are steak and fries. There could be other options, but we were both quite happy to have the steak and fries.Basically, the server just asks you how you like your steak and then brings you sliced steak and fries. It was quite good.After the main course we had deserts which were also quite good.Throughout the whole meal, service was great.I would definitely come back here, just not at a peak time. It might be a good place for a late lunch as there was practically no line to get in when we were leaving.",

The only choice this restaurant will have you make is regarding the temperature of your steak. As for wine, make it the house red; great drinkability at a decent price point.Soon after you place your order a pile of salad will arrive at your table dressed in a light mustardy vinaigrette with half a handful of walnuts strewn over the top. This salad tastes better than its homely appearance would have you believe.Next comes the steak, doused in a green sauce (don't ask what's in it, the recipe is highly guarded) and accompanied by a pile of fries. But this is only the beginning - one more portion of meat and frites is still to come! Who doesn't love seconds, right?It's no surprise they do not have ketchup but no aioli either? Mustard was no stand in dipper for my frites and I was left wishing for a bit of mayonnaisey goodness. However, I soon realized that the secret green sauce did the trick. Le Relais De Venise L'Entrecote is a lovely little respite from poring over menus night after night in search of what's good. They serve one thing only and they do it very well.",

Yes, the sauce is that good.BUT HERE'S THE MEGASICKTIP: Generally there's huge lines. like, 1 hour and 15 minutes on a saturday at 7:30 kind of lines. But I found a mini loop hole: go for the first seating (they open at 6:30, so queue up before then) OR go on SUNDAY around 8. At that point there was no line at all.*NOTE: I saw that they actually do have vegetarian options. It's the regular starter salad, a more baller salad as a main, and a free dessert.Carry on.",

If you are further then be ready to wait around an hour or so before you get in. So dress well and be prepared.",

I normally REALLY hate queueing for food in London, as you're never normally more than a five minute walk away from another good eaterie. A twenty minute queue on a Wednesday night in November was a bit excessive in my opinion (but in spite of looking up alternatives on my friend's iPad we stayed the course). It was sort of worth the wait, as after a while you just think, we've waited this long we may as well stay. Would I do it again? Probably not. Steak was well cooked, the sauce tasty, the mustardy dressing on the salad was very mustardy and with two helpings, I was full. Profiteroles were yummy (although extremely cold fillings - not sure if it was icecream) and the tarte citron very good. I'm glad I went but for another twenty minute queue it would have to be super special.",

With only a set menu you given the wine list \u00a0and desserts to chose from. The simple menu means that what they do cook they cook well, or medium should I say.My l'entrecote steak was delicious, full of flavour and tender, cut into slices and smothered in a 'special green' sauce. Accompanied by chips that kept being refreshed, yum. The biggest and best surprise of the evening was when I was brought over a second helping of steak! What a place, and all included in the price of the set menu. I finished with a creme brulee which tasted just perfect!I would certainly return, although with wine our bill did come to \u00a370- (for 2) so not somewhere I will be going every week.

I won't repeat what the other reviews attest to other than to confirm that: 1) We waited about 45 minutes in a queue snaking around the corner.2) There is no main menu. Drinks and desert are extra.3) Vegetarian (cheese platter) includes desert \"free\".4) The green sauce is delish.Everything is rushed. The interior is loud. Waitresses in French-maid getups quickly serve you food in an efficient manner. Fries are \"pre-cooked\" (i.e., not made to order) and sit in a large tray waiting to be dished out to you. The house wine was pretty good.For the steak itself, it is served in slices with green sauce. Americans who like their steak grilled will be disappointed. The steak reminds one of brisket. The steak is good, but again, not awe-inspiring. Don't expect Kobe beef.The desert was disappointing. I ordered the creme puffs and my friend ordered something resembling stacked macaroons. The pastries themselves were OK, but they were slathered in chocolate. It's like someone got a bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup and went loco. Not what I expect from a French restaurant.All in all Le Relais provides a unique experience in that it efficiently serves a single menu item at a good price. Just don't be fooled by the long name of the restaurant, this isn't fine dining.",

I personally much rather grab a good old Babette and chips for 15-20\u00a3 rather than being in this mess..Also the steak has no crust, could argue this is how French take steaks, the green sauce has hardly any flavour, the meat is under salted... The salad tends to be over dressed - the only charm seems to be fries.. Which for me is a very bad value... By the way, this is one menu restaurant, salad followed by steak in green butter sauce with fries.. I would easily live a happy life without ever having to go.., by the way, I did not have any particularly bad experience... It is just super crowded, and chaotic for nothing for my taste.",

    "text": "If there's one thing this girl loves, it's a nice steak cooked rare and big ol' glass of red wine. Luckily for me, that is all this place served. My husband and I were in London for a weekend trip, and he had eaten at their location in The City while in London for work, but they were closed that night. SO, we went to this location instead. We arrived at about 7:30 pm on a sunday evening, and there was a line (note: they do NOT take reservations). However, we didn't stand in line for longer than 20 minutes. And, if it's cold (like it was the evening we went, there are heaters outside the building to keep you warm while you wait. We sat down, with my husband on the booth side of the table, and myself in a normal chair. The waitress came up and to both of our surprise, pushed the table as far back towards the wall as it would go. At first I thought, well, that was bizzarre. But after I thought about it some more, there are quite a few tables crammed into such a small building. Ordering dinner consisted of the following: Hello and welcome. How do you like your steak cooked? Rare. And would you like something to drink? Red wine. Okay, that'll be right out. Easiest ordering process EVER! About 2 minutes later, our salad was brought out with our wine. The other nice thing about this restaurant only serving one type of food, is that your food comes out SO fast. Which pleased my belly, I was quite hungry.When the steak came out, and I saw a green sauce on top of it. I was a bit wary, as I've had some HORRIBLE sauces (most specifically roquefort sauces). But the sauce on the steak is great. The only thing I didn't like about eating here? There was too much food and I couldn't eat it all. Le sigh. I will definitely be going back to this restaurant the next time I'm in London. And just as a tip (at least while I was there), if you check in on yelp, you get half off on weekends at their canary wharf location.",

It did fill up in the next hour with people mostly there for business lunch and a few solo female shoppers with masses of shopping bags. The meal itself wasn't bad. Steak medium was exactly medium, served with more fries than steak. The sauce looked mustardy and oily and tasted bland. I actually added mustard from the jar on the table to give it a kick. Walnut salad was iceberg lettuce drenched in a bland mustard dressing but had no walnuts. Baguette was near perfect though. A glass of wine came filled exactly to the pre-drawn line. Overall, this place was ok but I wouldn't wait any amount of time. Branches in other cities, including the original Paris location are fairly busy but there is usually no wait.",

So on first impression, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. We were rushed into our seats and order taken within 3 minutes (or so it felt!) There were no smiles or charm but functional swiftness.Then came the plate. It was tiny. My friend next to me actually said the words \"I think I'm going to cry if this is all we're getting.\" Fortunately, cry he did not, as actually, they give you a small plate initially, then give you a full top up once you're running low, so that the meat is kept cooked perfectly for you and the food stays hot. I've never seen this approach before and it's pretty cool I must say.The steak comes sliced thinly, with shoestring fries and their special secret sauce on top. The sauce was unbelievably good. Between us, we couldn't figure it out. Somewhere between a gravy and a mushroom sauce with maybe a little bit of pesto thrown in?? My only regret was that I ordered the steak as medium (they don't do medium rare which would be my usual order) They offer 'blue', 'rare', 'medium' and 'well done', so in future I would definitely go for rare.The food really was excellent. It's just a pity you never really feel relaxed in there, and as I said, a smile wouldn't hurt. Either way, I'd definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I went here a couple of weeks ago for a work lunch and I was very impressed - the only reason for not giving it a 5 star review is because this girl is not a huge steak fan, though I could perhaps be swayed with future efforts. On arrival you are presented with bread and a simple, very simple salad. Then after choosing how you want your steak cooked, usual options, not long after it arrives cooked in the most divine - and secretive! - sauce ever along with a heavily heaped portion of frites. I highly recommend the house red to go along with this too, we loved it and it goes really well with the meal. When you are reaching the end of your meal, they come along with some more slices of your steak and even more frites if you require these! Three out of the five in our party chose desserts and we were all impressed, I had a lovely praline gelato which I recommend. \u00a0I would definitely recommend a visit here especially for a special occasion or a formal meal. The service was quick, efficient and friendly too making it even more of a winner. Located on the very trendy / sauve Marylebone Lane, just off the High Street it is convenient for walking and / or public transport due to its close proximity to Oxford Street and Baker Street.",

    "text": "It's been years people told me to come here, to experience their wonderful steak and their wonderful sauce and their wonderful whatsoever.Did I finally do it? Yes. Did I enjoy it? No. Plain. Simple.As Everybody else said (and I mean every other 136 reviews), one choice salad, steak, fries. Stop. Strange, I was prepared for it, ok, Cool.There is ALWAYS a queue in front of the place, on the weekend it could last for more than an hour, maybe even two. Luckily the place is REALLY crowded, otherwise there would probably a queue from there to Westminster. Ah when I mean crowded I mean SERIOUSLY crowded. I'm slim and I spent my whole time squeezed up in my seat, basically if you are more than 90 kg you'll have serious issues in finding a place here.. Maybe you are filling the place too much, you damn french business with an italian name!?!Ah BTW, this is a french place with an italian name where most of the waitresses are polish, we had peruvian beer and english steak. Funny, for a place pretending to be french. Whatever.Now, the meal: first is the salad, well, wow, IT'S A DAMN SALAD WITH WALNUT AND WALNUT OIL, get over with! I mean why should I even care in having such a thing? It's just a basic salad, no preparation, nothing: the pieces are even a bit too big for a salad, and there is nothing interested in it.Then it comes the steak. Drum rolls, trumpets and bla bla. Well, nothing special. I mean seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.The steak is good, but not that good (Wanna experience a serious steak? go to hawksmoore, THERE YOU'LL HAVE A DAMN STEAK). It comes as a \"tagliata\" (don't know the english name, sorry), basically it's already cut in slices, which is a very dangerous thing to do, as the meat will be cut somewhere and then put on the plate (actually it makes two movements after, from the cutting board to the tray and from the tray to the dish). Result: dry steak of course, as every bit of juice has been left over the two past surfaces. I mean there are serious errors, and they are making the strong points over that, how is it even possible!?!Yeah theoretically the dryness of our tortured piece of meat will be covered by the sauce. Now, the sauce is said to be \"the best part\". No it's not. It's a bit blend, basically it's just a fatty buttery sauce with mustard and pesto, that's it. No inspiration, no soul, no feeling. Just the usual blend sauce you'll find next to the roast in any self service in every hotel in the world. Ouch.I don't even want to speak about the fries, they are just fries, whatever. My dog can prepare it. And I don't even have a dog.So why the two stars!?!?RESURRECTIONINSPIRATIONHERE COMES THE DESSERT.Yes baby, bring it on that juicy profiterole! Aaaah the profiterole , you bloody bastard! awesomely sweet on the inside, deliciously bitter on the outside, a real chocolate sauce covering splendid bigne' filled with creamy gelato. Awesome, just DAMN AWESOME.If this place will even allow me to have just the profiterole avoiding that piece of boredom before, it'd deserve 5 stars. No, it'd deserve 6 stars, 7 stars, at least a galaxy.LONG LIFE TO THE PROFITEROLE. HALLELUJAH.",

    "text": "I came to this restaurant reluctantly as I am a vegetarian and L'Entrec\u00f4te is known for the steak frites. There is not a menu, you simply state how you want your meat cooked and that is all. I specified that I wanted a vegetarian order. And I'm not going to lie I was a BIT worried. I had no idea what was going to be on my plate.I was brought a simple salad with mixed greens, walnuts and a \"secret\" mustard dressing, which was delicious. Then they brought over the most massive, beautiful platter of assorted cheeses I have ever seen. I was able to select a bit of each cheese, which came out to be about 6 different cheeses, and quite large portions at that. From the brie to the roquefort, each one was DIVINE. Needless to say, I was the happiest camper. With my cheese, greens, and delicious glass of red, I was in heaven.And for those of you that do in fact eat meat, this is obviously the place for you. You do not only get one portion of steak, but they will bring you a second serving if you like. Their secret recipe for the green sauce that is put in the steak is incredible, I tried a spoonful. The chips are delicious too and are great for dipping in any of extra special sauce you have left on your plate.Service is quite good here and they move rather quickly. Be prepared to shout, as the restaurant is quite loud. But it has a wonderful vibe and buzz to it. The puddings menu is quite extensive with tons of options. From rich cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to lighter sorbet options, there is something for everyone. So all you vegetarians out there should never fear the lovely L'Entrec\u00f4te. It is definitely worth waiting in the que for.",

A meal at Le Relais is 50% food, 50% some schmuck tourist friend made me stand in a line for a restaurant that only does one dish. \u00a0I really enjoyed my last meal there, especially the salad and the fries. \u00a0Having recently eaten at 5 Guys, I don't think that is a fair comparison; McDs vs Relaix would've been more apt, as 5 Guys serve those skin-on peanut oil reeking variety which, lets be honest, are subpar to anyone that knows anything about french fries.I don't recall the room being so tight and the service being so snotty, but perhaps tight is relative to a Texan, you fat pigs -- JOKING, it is a bit tight in there, but as far as service goes, it depends on the server and how busy it is. \u00a0The steak is quite good, though could be overly lean if one is splitting hairs, and I do enjoy the sauce. \u00a0That said, there are loads of great new steakhouses in London which might get my money before Le Relais.",

There's always a queue outside, but when you finally arrive at the front prepare to be greeted by some stroppy French waiter/waitress ushering you to your seat and slapping a delicious salad on the table that you hadn't ordered. Let's just say the service isn't friendly here. Let's also say that they don't do medium rare or medium to well done.Let's also say they couldn't tell my coeliac mum whether or not their delicious green sauce had gluten in it as it's flown in from France and is a secret (what a load of tosh). Inspite of all this, their steak is really delicious. Served with fries (and only fries) you'll get a first helping, followed by a second one about 20 minutes later. You'll greedily chuff it down even if you are full. I've never made it to the dessert menu but I'm sure it's nice.

I'm such a disorganised bloke that I never really think about booking until waaay to late for nice restaurants, so a 10 minute wait outside is a small price to pay for leaving a nice dinner out with my mum to the last minute...2. \u00a0There is no choice of mains - Awesome... My mum is sooo indecisive in restaurants that choosing from a medium sized menu can take most of the evening. \u00a0The fact that the choice is restricted to \"How do you like your steak?\" \u00a0severley cut down waiting times!3. \u00a0The place is packed - Awesome... There is a queue of people waiting to get in (I'd estimate between 10 mins to 45 mins whilst I was there), the tables are close together and the constant burble of conversation creates an ongoing ambience of people getting down to the no nonsense, serious business of stuffing themselves silly. \u00a0A proper unpretentious eating establishment.4. \u00a0The service - Awesome... Despite the busyness of the place, the servers are attentive and quick without being obtrusive. \u00a0At no point did I feel rushed, yet every time I needed something a waitress seemed to have read my mind and was standing there with what I wanted.5. \u00a0The wine - Awesome... \u00a0It was both super tasty (from the restaurants own vineyard) and very reasonable.6. \u00a0The food - You've guessed it... Awesome - The dressed walnut salad to start was delicious and the perfect size to whet my appetite without making me feel as though I was going to have to start eating the table. \u00a0The perfectly cooked steak with a divine herb butter sauce and heavenly fries were each simple, but together like all great meals far more than the sum of their parts. \u00a0NOTE: remember this is French, so if you usually like your steak medium-rare, go medium, if you usually go well done (philistine), then ask for it burned....7. \u00a0The price - Awesome... I see someone has had a bit of a whinge in one of the earlier reviews, but I reckon \u00a320 for a two course dinner, paired with \u00a317 fine wine (Making it around \u00a360 for food and wine for 2) is damn fine value!I will definitely go again, the only question is whether I have to wait until I have an excuse to take someone or whether I will just pop in on my own the next time I walk past... It may well be the second!Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!",

They only serve steak frites, but they do it very well. Best of all? Once you've eaten your yummy dinner, the come back with a second serving. Yep, steak frites twice! I don't know why, but having steak frites twice is going to improve my evening. And I was having a pretty great time as it was. They do demi bottles of wine, which is a good thing - if there's two of you, you won't get chance to finish a whole bottle before they're asking for their table back. The profiteroles weren't great (ice cream instead of cream) but when you're paying \u00a319 for dinner and you get STEAK TWICE, who cares about the desserts? Did I mention you get steak TWICE?",

    "text": "I had high expectations of this restaurant since it was highly recommended by friends who've been to the original Parisian branch (which was unfortunately under renovation when I visited one Summer). Alas, I was rather put off by the service (snooty, impersonal French.. it's like being in Paris all over again!) and small portions. If you are a steak lover, you'll find the steak decent, but nothing to rave about. My impression was more of a factory production line, where the waiter asks how you want your steak done - medium rare, medium or well done. They then serve you from a tray of pre-cooked meats, rather than prepare your food individually. The result can be disappointing, as the meat is at times luke warm, and the standards can vary. I was rather incensed that the waiter served me a very small portion of beef, and gave a much larger portion to the couple beside me. We were all paying the same price! Not only that, when we were given the choice of a 2nd (and final) helping, my portions remained small! Call it bad luck, but I was NOT impressed. To be fair, they made very good thin cut fries, and you could have as many servings as you desired. But I was hardly there for the fries, and had not intended to fill myself with a stomachful of oily high-caloried potatoes! If you're after good steak, by all means try this venue since it's received a lot of thumbs up from other patrons. But I doubt you'll leave feeling much impressed - it's one of those been there, done that experiences. I won't be going back.",

Sliced steak and fries...and if you want, a second order of the same. A salad to start and wine. You don't have any real choices, which is great when you just want to eat.

We were seated promptly and put in our orders. I was a little hesitant to go to this place as I like my steak a certain way (blue - as in, almost still alive) and it almost always disappoints in the UK (because a steak ordered blue in Britain often comes out as medium rare or even medium - ick! And British people get twitchy if you send food back in restaurants, so it really is rolling the dice). But my friend really wanted steak and this seemed like a good option in the neighborhood.As others have noted, there are no menu choices - only desired level of doneness for steak. I ordered mine blue. We also got the house Bordeaux, which paired nicely with the food. When the steak came out, it actually was blue! Success! But the plate was so ripping hot that it was starting to convert the beautiful bloody meat to a grey overcooked mess, so I had to be uncouth and evacuate it to the bread plate. The server gave me a \"wtf\" look and I tried to explain, but she didn't speak English, so they probably just thought I was a weirdo, but whatever. That's better than ending up with overcooked steak.Overall, it was a reasonably good dinner, but for \u00a324, I could make myself better steak frites. Nice atmosphere, though. I'd say it's worth it if you want a simple, pretty good meal, but it's definitely not worth waiting more than a few minutes. If the line is long, probably better to find someplace else.",

    "text": "After all the hype, it was a bit of a letdown for \"affordable authentic French food\" and it felt a bit touristy. My context: At my local taphouse in a collegetown back in America, there is a Monday night dinner special where I can get a similar quality steak with mashed potatoes for $5 (with purchase of a craft beer on tap). So when I heard that this steak dinner would be an amazing deal and the sauce would be what seals it, I expected more.What I got (everyone gets) for 24 pound deal = *To start: a fairly run-of-the-mill waldorf salad (walnuts, romaine, mustard-based dressing) and half of a French baguette, which was soft but cold and I would have liked some butter to go on it. I ended up dipping it in dijion mustard, as there was a jar of it on the table and I liked the kick *Supposed star of the show: Two servings of steak frites (cooked only at rare, medium or well, already slice and covered in a mustard-based sauce) - This might sound like the typical (possibly ignorant) American tourist, but I'm not used to already have my steak cut for me and not being able to order my desired medium rare. The sauce also tasted a bit bland to me. The frites were fine - shoe-string so extra crispy. Overall, this was plenty of food but afterward, I felt unsatisfied so I ordered dessert (rare for me!)Ultimate letdown - the lemon tarts. I was shocked to receive what seemed like grocery chain store quality dessert as they had rock hard crust that seemed to lack sugar and a filling that tasted more saccharine rather than zippy from citrus (which I craved).With a glass of the cheapest house red wine and gratuity added on to the bill, my dinner ran closer to 40 pounds total. So I suggest to avoid waiting in line, and instead save your money for street or pub food of similar (sometimes better) quality for a quarter of the cost.",

They won't do your steak medium-rare, for example, and wine list is pretty much \"Red or white?\" Still, those are minor inconveniences when the result is so satisfying. The one real misstep was the crazy overload of mustard in the salad dressing. This location is ideal: on a quiet side street around the corner from Marylebone High Street. The interior can be a bit loud and more than a bit crowded, but it feels lively rather than annoying. The service is pleasant and appropriately brisk.

    "text": "It's amazing what you run into these days with a simple \"French restaurant\" google search.Le Relais de Venise (which I believe to mean \"Over from Venice\") is one of those cozy little restaurants neatly packed away in London's many streets and alleys. From outside it looks like a classic French cafe, which sits two minutes away from the city's busiest shopping epicenter (bond street/oxford street). I didn't have high expectations for this place despite the many glowing reviews my peers had given it; I quickly withdrew my preconceived notions when the meal began.We arrived at 6:15 pm (15 minutes before the restaurant opens) - mind you, this is a Tuesday night, not the weekend - and the line of eagerly waiting customers was already curling around the corner. I knew I was in for a treat. It was rather funny once we were seated because I picked up the menu card (see photo) and there was literally ONE choice listed: The walnut salad and entrecote with a \"famous sauce.\" I'm a sucker for guarded restaurant secrets and I knew that must have been the reason why everyone frequents it. The meal is split into \"first\" and \"second\" service (first and second helpings) and only costs 23 pounds (~$35).. That's like restaurant week prices back in America. The salad was quite simple and leafy. As I savored the tangy dijon flavor of the dressing, I took a minute to survey my surroundings. The waitresses were hustling around taking orders and serving customers. The restaurant had filled up in the first 5 minutes and there were already another 100 people waiting outside. Our first serving had arrived and it was a perfectly medium-rare piece of tender beef. Entrecote typically comes from the rib side of the cow, but could also be a sirloin, depending on how it's cut. I digress. The meat could have been a little warmer, but then again they were entertaining a full dinner service and the food came in a timely manner. The beef was smothered in the most delicious french sauces I've ever tasted. It wasn't a bearnaise as far as I could tell. And I definitely don't think there was any pepper in it. The consistency was somewhat soupy and the greenish tinge must have been taken from an herb. After several tastings, I feel like it might be basil (perhaps an allusion to Venice/Italy?). The rich, flavorful aftertaste of butter lingered on your palate after every bite - \u00a0probably a thickening agent used at the very end. The seasoning was perfect. I also tasted some garlic and maybe white wine? If it's a french sauce, they probably began with minced shallots too, which they later strained out (providing a little sweetness). But what do I know? (see photo). I ventured to ask them, and of course I got \"it's a secret.\"They gratuitously pile on a load of french fries which sort of adds an extra 500 calories to your meal, but it somehow goes well with the rest of the meat. After all, 'meat and potatoes' is always a fail-safe. When you think you're done, you're surprised to be offered another portion of everything! Each serving of beef is a little smaller than a filet, but overall, it's quite filling. It was indeed very delicious.We finished the meal off with the Vacherin de Relais dessert; a tower of meringue and ice cream blanketed with chocolate syrup and a dollop of chantilly cream on top. So amazing (see photo). I would definitely come here again for this eating experience. You won't be spoiled for choice, but the one thing they offer is a home run. A toast to French cuisine. 5/5",

You get a waldorf salad, steak (sorry vegetarians) , chips and the most incredible sauce you will ever taste. You pay a flat rate (I can't remember exactly how much, I want to say \u00a320) and you can basically have as much as you want to eat. The chips are crispy, the steak is super, and again, let me just say, THE SAUCE. You will dream of this sauce for days afterwards. I think there must be some highly addictive substance in it, because I was getting major withdrawals during the hazy weeks that followed. The staff are attentive, the wine is reasonable but good, and it's always a buzzy atmosphere. I'm uncertain of whether you can book a table, but normally the wait isn't too long.",

The menu is fixed and consists of a salad, steak, and fries. \u00a0As soon as you sit, a server greets you and immediately asks how you want your steak cooked: rare, medium, or well done. \u00a0The bread and butter they set on the table for you is quite tasty but try not to eat too much of it, because you will have a generous portion of food coming your way. \u00a0The salad comes with a mustard vinaigrette which was delicious. \u00a0As soon as you are finished, they bring you your first portion of steak with fries. \u00a0When you finish that, they will bring your second portion of steak with MORE fries. \u00a0The steak is served with their \"famous\" sauce, which was outstanding. \u00a0They do have dessert, which looked great, but I was way too full to eat anything else.Fun: They serve your main course in two portions so that it remains hot. \u00a0Also, they do have a vegetarian option available! \u00a0I believe the vegetarian meal is the salad with some sort of selection of cheeses along with the fries, and your choice of dessert. \u00a0Both the vegetarian and meat-lovers meals are only 23 pounds! Not bad for great, quality food.",

    "text": "Le Relais de venise only does one thing, but it does it well: steak frittes. On being seated, the server will ask how you want your steak cooked - if you're vegetarian and/or have a nut allergy, this is your opportunity to shout. The green salad brought to you before your main has walnuts on top, but if you ask for them to be left off, it's not a problem. What may be a bigger problem is that the chips are cooked in groundnut oil - if you have a peanut allergy, you will starve.I believe vegetarians can substitute their steak for a lot of cheese, but it's an expensive option. \u00a324 for steak frittes or \u00a324 for fromage frittes with a dessert. If you're a veggie, I just wouldn't bother.The steak is brought to you in two parts, which effectively works out as two giant plates of cow and chips, so it's a big undertaking. My advice is to skip lunch because if you can't finish the main, you will be disappointed with yourself.The desserts are around the \u00a35/\u00a36 mark and are nice (the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a reliable offering) however you will probably be too full to manage one. House wine (around \u00a35 a glass, \u00a310 for a carafe, \u00a320 for a bottle) is drinkable enough.You can't book a table even if you're a group, so eat early (5.30pm) or expect to queue out the door. Although tables are a little close, that's because there are a lot of people who want to get in and don't mind sitting on their neighbours.All in all, this isn't a cheap meal, but it's a substantial one, cooked well.",

One girl who served at our table always put on a shit face and was very rude. We had four people here and she was keeping pushing the table to my friends side which made them really uncomfortable, and she didn't say anything about that. Apart from that, my friends went shopping afternoon so they had some big bags, in case that those would block the aisle, they saved their belongings temporarily at the cloakroom. When we about to leave and asked staff to get the stuff back, one girl just stared at us with very disgusting face and chose to ignore us.So, if you want to experience this kind of world standard shit service, please come here, I bet you've got little temper to lose here.",

When I learned that there was another version in London, I had to make sure I had to bookmark it on my trip here.Walking in the London version, it even feels like you're in Paris. The tables are very cramped and that you are literally right next to another stranger only inches away. So you need to pull out the table to move around.And just like the Paris versions, there are no menus. Just steak and frites with a small salad in the beginning. But it's the sauce that makes this place standout compared to other steak joints. It has a nice, tangy vinaigrette flavor that only this restaurant can provide. The steaks by themselves are just normal steaks, served in only \"Rare\" or \"Medium.\" Even \"medium rare\" is not allowed. Again, just rare or medium here in London.And just like the Paris version, you get your second serving shortly after you finished your first plate. And as for the dessert, you may need one of the French waitresses to help you out since the menu is in French. But I went with the Profiteroles au chocolat. Nice warm chocolate smothering some vanilla ice cream with shaved walnuts. Now that is a great way to finish the meal.",

Quite fabulous for a business lunch (though it does fill up quickly) -- as you'll not be waiting around for everyone to make decisions and can be back to your office swiftly. The guesswork has been removed. You'll be having steak. And salad. And chips. And that green sauce everyone moans about for days and days... And if you're like me, you'll be thrilled. Yum.

    "text": "Bloody Hell (for lack of a better commonwealth expression, I apologize), this place is fabulous!I arrived at 6pm (when they open for dinner) sharp after attending the theater, and the line was already one block long! \u00a0We were the last group to be seated snagging the final open table, and we had a minimal wait of 10 minutes. \u00a0If I had to wait 45 minutes, I would have done it gladly.Intriguing fact number 1: There was no menu. I was so confused. My date (sister in law) was getting the giggles off the bat watching me trying to piece together this culinary puzzle. A lady came to take our order, simply asking how we liked our meat. Strange, what if I wanted fish....? I said rare, and then she took a marker to my side of the table with a large \"R\" (clearly it is paper table cloths!) Intriguing fact number 2: Then they brought out a salad. I didn't ask for a salad, but I certainly didn't send it back! \u00a0Butter leaf lettuce with walnuts and a mustard vinegrette. It was so simple and yum! Then the waitress came to the table and served me beautifully butterflied steak strips with a green sauces and hot chips. \u00a0The chips were long, skinny and crunchy! \u00a0And the meat, well, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The meat is imported from Scotland, and it is in a league of it's own!!! \u00a0Intriguing fact number 3: I got my entree, twice! Oh yes, what is better than one delicious meal? Having two helpings of it! SO don't worry when you polish off your plate.... more is coming!!!Head out there (early) so that you can roll out of there like I did, content and happy as a clam. I wish we had one of these in Nor cal because I would be there all the time!!!",

    "text": "You ever meet those people that are really, REALLY good at one thing? Like, you have that roommate you went to school with who knows trivia from \"The Matrix\" movies better than anyone, or there was that girl you crushed on who could mop the floor with anyone on Wednesday nights when the local pub is having trivia for the week and the theme is H.P. Lovecraft and you're both impressed and terrified? This place is like your friend, only they are incredibly good at serving steak and fries. Oh, and being awesomely personable. And being able to tolerate a table of out-of-towners (from Texas, to boot) with the patience and sass of someone who can easily blend patience and sass while also convincing me to have not one but two scotches after a bottle of wine. Yes, this place and the staff are that good.We arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night per the recommendations of the locals. The place is a small restaurant with a line wrapping around the corner and extending back into a corner of an alley where you can look up at the guy living in the apartment across from the place who methodically paces while on the phone and organizes his shoe collection (sorry guy who lives across the place - but your shoe collection is boss). There's a reason people are willing to wait 45+ minutes in the cold and rain for this place. And if you're still reading this review, you're about to find out why.We probably waited around 25 minutes, but we got lucky. A professional and polite hostess greeted us at the door when our turn in line had come and we were walked to a table in a crowded dining room. Let there be no doubt: L'Entrecote has figured out how to maximize their space and the maximum occupancy here is probably 6,000 despite being the size of my hotel's lobby. You'll be making new friends at your table, such as the traveling couple next to us who were absolutely sweet, so if you're shy, you may need to get over that real quick.Our waitress came over and took our order and immediately panic sunk in. No \"medium rare\" steak?! Send me back to Texas where our beef is still moo-ing when you cut into it! Turns out there was nothing to fear as the \"medium\" steak was heavenly. My advice would be to placate the salad beforehand and save room for the main course. Don't get me wrong - the salad may rock your socks off but the steak and fries will also send your socks to the cleaners and bring them back with a complimentary breath mint. The whole place operates on a \"steak and fries are our entrees\" menu, and there's a reason: the sauce. If you've tasted their sauce and found it anything less than a miracle on your plate, please book a trip to the local funeral parlor because you clearly were born without a soul. I went back for seconds, another in our party went back for thirds. Add all this up on our bottle of red wine and you have a meal fit for anyone who plans on eating themselves into a coma. This doesn't even take dessert into consideration, with the absolute best profiteroles I have ever had. Bonus tip for those of you still reading: get a round of scotch (or two, in my case) with the profiteroles. Not only will the sweetest bartender in the world deliver them, but you will find out that this is a combo no one can beat without some serious effort.Speaking of the sweet staff, everyone working here is an undercover angel. I'm convinced of it. I never call out staff in my reviews but our server, Asia, was phenomenal. She not only put up with our relentless questions and my request for scotch after wine and port, but she did it with a level of quick wit that immediately endeared her with all of us. The team here helps each other out, with one girl removing empty glasses deftly and naturally, the bartender delivering scotch with a divine smile, and the food runners polished and focused on their destination. Make no mistake, the reason this place operates as efficiently as it does is because of the immaculate workers under the roof.Sure, you can knock on them for wanting to turn a table quickly to get the line out the door moving, and you can complain about the limited menu. Doing either of those is providing a grave disservice to this establishment, a hearty dining option filled with delicious food, professional staff and a diverse enough dessert menu to ensure you need to come back. And if this is your first time eating here, I genuinely envy you and what you are about to experience.",

    "text": "After a little confusion about whether this was an all you can eat place (it isn't), a group of 8 of us headed here for dinner while in London. After looking on Yelp I was really worried about just how long we'd have to queue for but thankfully on a Thursday if you arrive around 6 - 6.30, you won't have to wait at all. Score!We were seated at a large table and they quickly took our orders - I mean, super quickly. The only thing available is the steak and chips (with a salad to start) and they simply ask how you want it done. Options are blue, rare, medium and well done. I went for rare as I figured this being their speciality it was better to go for less cooked than over cooked. I didn't particularly enjoy the salad starter, to be it was just a normal kind of salad with dressing. There was also bread on the side which again, didn't win me over as it was just a standard kind of baguette. When the steak arrived though, I was in heaven. Lovely and pink with a delicious gravy kind of sauce and a good portion of chips. I quite like that they served your meat in two goes although I'm sure the second portion that was served to me was my workmates order of blue steak as it was a hell of a lot more bloody than my first portion (that being said, I still ate it). Service here is weird - they are all aloof and abrupt. I didn't realise we were still in those days of service, I thought that died along with Gordon Ramsay's popularity in the early 2000s. Stuffy, unfriendly service is never going to win me over no matter how good the food is. If the staff were a bit more upbeat and accommodating this place would have been upgraded to 5 stars for sure.",

Just when you think you've devoured it all, they come back with a full second portion of all this too. Ohhh seconds?? Yes please.All this is after you enjoy a wardorf salad as part of your main, which is fab too.This place has a few restaurants around town as well as NYC and Paris were it originated from. With one thing on the menu, sit back, order a glass of red wine and wait for the sensory delights to arrive (twice). It's consistently good whichever branch I've been at (note- I once went Canary Wharf and they had 50% off at weekends).",

    "text": "\"WOOHOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS\" definitely describes this place. A friend first brought me here on a cold day where we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a table. But I came back the following week with friends, and then again with my family, until we figured out it was best to come before it opens to be the first wave of customers in. And then it became a regular thing with anyone visiting, ever. Or any catch up, or any birthday celebrations - yes - we're going to Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote for dinner.The experience starts with a mouth watering walnut salad with this yummy sauce, but the unspeakably good star of the show is the sauce that comes with the steak. Let me rewind a bit and say that steak and fries is all you're gonna get. You tell the waitress how you like it (blue, rare, medium or well done - there is no in-betweens), she writes it on the table and off she goes. When it comes out - you are presented with a plate of delicious steak and fries to mop up all the excess sauce you manage not to cram in on every single bite. I was so shocked the first time I came here because, as normal, I finished my meal in record time still lusting for more. AND MORE THERE WAS. The waitress comes back with the SECOND HALF (?!?!) of your meal, the steak that was still in the kitchen so that it won't go cold, and an extra helping of fries. Lord have mercy.And once you think you can't go on, you have a look around and get massive food envy as all these delicious looking desserts start piling out. Now, I don't speak french so you're just gonna have to figure this one out on the menu yourself but the MUST orders are the profiteroles (which I usually don't like, but these are filled with vanilla ice cream instead of cream and are DELICIOUS!) and this stack of ice cream, meringue, praline, amazingness.This place is definitely a 10/10 in my books!",

They start you off asking how you like your meat and then bring you a little tasty salad with a mustard vinaigrette. Shortly after you finish your salad they bring you a plate with a semi small amount of steak in peppercorn sauce and fries. Don't worry about the size! They come around after you've eaten your way through it with plate refills of fries AND steak! I was full from my first plate (looks can be deceiving with size! Eyes bigger than stomach!) I can say without any doubt this is the best steak I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and the meat was flawless, zero gristle to trim and full of flavor. I had a delightful Peruvian beer with dinner and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert - my man had a small bottle of red wine. The waitress was friendly and checked in with us a few times.

    "text": "Let my forewarn you, dear reader, that my entire experience at this restaurant, as at so many restaurants, was spent in a very pleasant mental fog induced by copious amounts of alcohol imbibed over the course of a warmish English summer's day. \u00a0Thus this review is more of a hazy recollection of the overall sensory experience of eating at Entrecote rather than a blow by blow account of what was quite a good meal.I arrived at Entrecote in my customary style: \u00a0stumbling out of a cab and most likely leaving the bill for some poor sod in my company to pay. \u00a0It's easy to sum up my first impressions: \u00a0\"gee, that's a long line\". \u00a0Entrecote doesn't take bookings and so unless you time your visit cleverly you will have to hang around outside for 20 or 30 minutes. \u00a0The most observant readers out there may have noticed that I was the slightest bit sozzled and might have inferred -- correctly -- that I was not the sharpest tool in the drawer at this point of the night.There followed a rather unpleasant minute or two in which I wondered how it would feel to be 20 minutes soberer in 20 minutes time, when my next alcoholic beverage could presumably be procured. \u00a0I was fortunately saved from the deep depression this sobering thought (excuse the pun) engendered by a rather wonderful group of lesbians in front of me who most ingeniously went to the pub across the street and came back with a tray of drinks! \u00a0This made the wait in the queue pass in a most agreeable fashion.Second impression: \u00a0good atmosphere. \u00a0Third impression: \u00a0where's the menu? \u00a0Entrecote serve...well, entrecote and frites. \u00a0And salad. \u00a0And wine. \u00a0And bread. \u00a0I think that's about it. \u00a0Your only choice is how you want your meat done. \u00a0Being \"un snob bourr\u00e9\" I of course ordered mine blue.Fourth impression: \u00a0my plate is empty. \u00a0Fifth impression: \u00a0my plate magically refills itself! \u00a0This is the only restaurant I've ever been in where you get the exact same meal served to you twice. \u00a0Most innovative.The food was pretty good, and from recollection was 20 pounds or so which for London seems OK value. \u00a0Of course our bill was far more than that due to the wine I kept ordering. \u00a0Following Hemmingway's maxim \"Any man who eats dessert is not drinking enough\", I didn't have dessert so I can't vouch for that. \u00a0I did have another bottle of wine though.",

But it is worth the wait. I went on a Friday night and as long as the line was, it kept moving. The food, i.e. the one thing you can eat there, is really something. Steak and fries with the \"mystery\" sauce, that's it. I say mystery because apparently it's a pretty well guarded secret. \u00a0I've found from talking with coworkers that everyone has their opinions as to what's in it. \u00a0It's a fun game to play while you eat. After you clean your plate and reflect on the great meal you just had, the waitress appears like an angel with the second helping. The house wine was decent and the price for the meal was well below the high quality of the food. We also tried a few of the deserts, which is crazy considering how full we were after the main course. It was worth the loosening of the belt.Seriously recommended!",

You get a green salad with a walnut dressing, steak, fries that's it. \u00a0They have wine and beer too. \u00a0The steak comes with this magical green sauce that they won't tell you because it's a secret recipe. \u00a0We devoured our steak and fries and then all of a sudden you get more steak and fries! \u00a0This place was so addicting and am so happy we have one here in NYC because I need to go back!",

    "text": "Perfect for a quick and tasty lunch, with a set menu starting with a tangy green salad, and then perfectly portioned slices of beef drenched in that yummy secret sauce that you'll crave even after being done with it, and a side of thin but flavorful french fries. There's a list of deserts you can end your meal with but I do especially recommend the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9. The atmosphere can be great or dreadful depending on who you ask, being a loud, almost always crowded place can put off some but also, in the right mood, be quite fun! The lack of the ability to book before coming is unfortunate considering the queue that can go on for half an hour at times (though I didn't see one the last time I went), but you owe it to yourself to at least try that heavenly-sauce-drenched slices steak!",

    "text": "Relais de Venise is a Parisian born phenomenon. Its original Paris bistro opened in 1959 by Paul Gineste de Saurs, who merely sought a place to serve his family's Ch\u00e2teau de Saurs wines. Opting for an especially short and traditional bistro menu of a simple salad (lettuce, walnuts and potent mustard vinaigrette), steak-frites with a butter-based secret recipe sauce of herbs, spices and condiments along with a few particularly moreish desserts (save room for the profiteroles!), the no nonsense bistro soon won fans for its quality over variety dining experience. It also won a reputation for its strict no reservations policy. Legend tells of married couples meeting on queue and of people securing their next job while waiting for their Frenchy meat and potatoes chow down. Based on my experience dining at the Marylebone Lane Relais (but without yet having the pleasure of visiting the flagship in Paris or their other London location in the City), I reckon the food's worth a bit of a wait. The flavoursome frites - made of Bintje potatoes from France that are hand chipped daily on the premises using a bespoke chipper to ensure a signature 7mm thin slice \u00a0are out of this world, and the much speculated upon but never revealed secret sauce is a most delectable accompaniment. Here in London, the bistros serve Donald Russell steaks from Aberdeenshire beef (supplier to HM The Queen) for their entrecote steak (which they'll even serve blue). An order of salad and main course is priced at \u00a320 per person and yields a more than ample amount of food. Puds cost around \u00a35. A glass of house red is \u00a34.25. Vegetarians are welcome, and as a substitute for the steak a selection of cheeses is offered and a dessert is included for the same price of \u00a320. Service is perfunctory and fast.",

    "text": "When I've had a really bad day, I want to leave work and have a stress-free evening. This involves an easy choice of venue for dinner, reliably good food, maybe an affordable bottle of wine, and a food-induced coma putting me to sleep. For these nights, Relais delivers.The two locations are convenient for me (The City, and Marylebone), and the food never disappoints. From the walnut salad to the expertly trimmed steak and decadent secret sauce, and just as importantly the very affordable, highly tasty house wine, it is a sure thing that always puts a smile on my face.No reservations means the usual dilemma: (1) arrive before opening to beat the line, or (2) get in the queue and wait your turn. The line moves fast, and is expectedly shorter in the winter, so that helps, but in general, it moves very quickly. To facilitate this, though, you do give up some service during the meal, but as long as you have the right mindset going into it, that is manageable.As for the price, at twenty pounds a head, its a little steep. But there's just nothing else like it, and when you see the demand, you can't really blame them.Four stars for delivering on ease, food, wine, and coma. I'll be here often!",

But waiiiiiit, 2/3 way through I get a second plate. More meat! With some successful flirting by my friends, we get a massive dosage of fries. \u00a0The sauce is made JUST as sauce should be made in French steak de boeuf avec frites. I was so happy leaving here.

First the good things: the ambiance was noisy and convivial, the salad was excellent and the frites were spot on.The steak, however, came in a roughly 6 ounce serving, drowned in a pleasant but nondescript green sauce. The meat under the sauce could just as easily have been mushrooms chicken or tofu. There were seconds, which brought the total steak serving up to around 9 ounces.So \u00a0\u00a320 seems to me a lot to pay for a salad and frites, however good. Seldom has this happened, but I really felt ripped off.Go get a steak frites at your local, you will almost certainly get better quality at a better price.",

    "text": "Here's one American who didn't think this place was all that amazing. \u00a0Before I get lambasted, here are the reasons why. \u00a01) It was marketed to me as a great one-of-a-kind establishment, but it turns out they're a chain with locations all around the world. \u00a02) Rushed service - since everyone knows what you're basically going to order, wine/bread/salad/steak/frites are essentially dumped out in front of you.3) I really hate it when waitresses ask you for still or sparkling, you say still, and they pop the cap off an expensive bottle of Evian. \u00a0Well, you won't get me again - I say tap water everywhere I go now.4) Nothing was that amazing. \u00a0The salad had this garlic dressing (in all honesty, it's been a while, the flavor might not have been garlic, but it was really strong whatever it was) that completely overpowered the rest of the salad, the steak had only what seemed to be a watered-down curry flavor, and the frites were tiny. \u00a0I also didn't love when they gave me more food. \u00a0Now don't get me wrong, I do love getting free food, but the way they present it has all the trappings of shoveling gruel on your plate. \u00a0The desserts looked amazing, and I ordered this macaroon tower, but they also failed to impress.5) \u00a0Finally, I realize they can do nothing about this, but does every freakin' person in the UK smoke? \u00a0Waiting in the 1 hour queue, we were continually blasted by smoke. \u00a0On the other hand, the two people waiting behind us were a lot of fun - a great way to meet new people. \u00a0Anyways, if I ever want to eat here again, (and I don't), I'll just go to one of the US locations...no reason to go to a US chain when I'm overseas, and I won't be making that mistake again.",

    "text": "Such a simple concept, but one of the most enjoyable evenings I've had in a while. They don't take reservations so you start by queuing outside the restaurant, but with the heat lamps and company it can be quite an enjoyable wait. Once you're seated you are presented with a fairly bland looking salad of greens, walnuts and mustard dressing accompanied by freshly baked French bread. But as I learned last night, looks can be deceiving. The mustard dressing is complex in flavour and makes the salad truly spectacular. You are then given one choice, how would you like your steak cooked... rare, medium or well done. It's positively criminal to order anything other than rare. But don't worry, although rare arrives very red in colour, it does not bleed all over the plate. The steak is covered in a mystery green sauce. I have no idea what's in it, but wow it's delicious. And of course the steak is accompanied by piles of frites. Just when you think you're starting to feel full, a second helping of steak and frites are served. I ate the steak (how can you not?), but had to leave the frites so I would have room for dessert. \u00a0To accompany our meal we had the house red, again it was fantastic, perfectly complementing the meal. Desserts are also delicious. I would recommend the profiteroles that are served with ice-cream instead of cream. All this and just \u00a320 a head + wine and dessert. Not a bad deal at all!",

    "text": "After months of wanting to come here, but knowing about the queues, we were finally out and about in London and ready to eat right about the time they opened, so I figured it would be the perfect time to go (as no queue, right?) Luckily I was right and we got right in.The menu, easy, steak and fries. And a salad to start. We get our salads and order our wine. The wine comes, the waitress opens it, pours a partial glass (for tasting I assume) and then sets the wine down on the table and walks off? What? Um, shouldn't you wait to make sure the wine is okay before you just leave in on the table and disappear. I mean, if it's not, I suppose we don't have to pour it and drink it, but given the servers come around practically never, that's really not an option. So I take a sip, and joking look over my shoulder, \"Oh yes, that's great thanks!\" Then the wine turns out to be NOT the wine we ordered. Luckily it was a cheaper wine, so we didn't feel so bad about drinking it, and it was quite tasty, but still, why can't the waitress remember what wine to bring? At this point I comment that perhaps they're going for the authentic French experience: rude waitstaff. Except that every place I've been to in France, they've been more than courteous and not at all rude, so clearly if that's what they're going for, they'd going for the stereotype.The steaks arrived. They are arranged fairly unattractively on a small plate with a pile of chips on the side. It was decidingly unattractive and unappealing. You'd think a restaurant that does ONE dish would be able to do it in a way that actually makes it appealing to eat. It also seemed a bit small, but for some unknown reason (because it keeps the food hot maybe? I don't really know) they bring a second portion of the food around when you're done.The food though, yeah it was good. The steak was cooked rare and the sauce was tasty. The chips were also great (and I used some of the mustard on them, tasty). Weirdly though, the steak itself was kind of chewy and not really that great. Again, you'd think a restaurant that ONLY MAKES THIS DISH would make it perfectly. I can cook a better steak at home. Who are the chefs that work here?We get dessert: The other half orders cheese and I order the raspberry tart. I then get up to use the bathroom, and when I return, there are two strawberry tarts on the table. Um, I ordered raspberry. So I can see why they only do one dish now, because that way the servers don't have to remember what people order because clearly they can't. About five minutes later, the cheese finally comes. They serve my other half up some cheese (and it's a lot of cheese, be prepared if you order the cheese for dessert). I mention that they brought the wrong tarts. The server gave me the ugliest stare for even mentioning that it was wrong, but they said they'd bring me the correct tarts. Then they say they'll bring bread for the cheese. Afterwards, I turn to my other half and say, \"Hmm, I wonder which they'll bring first, the tarts or the bread\". Turns out I won, as the tarts turned up. I slowly start eating my tarts (which were quite tasty), and no bread shows up. Finally, I turn around and grab some random person walking by and say, \"Can we get some bread for the cheese?\"She gets bread, then notices that they didn't bring a knife for the cheese (at least this one noticed), so she ran off to get the bread. The cheese turned out quite nice, but we paid the bill and left, and noticed the queue outside the door as we walked away.Bottom line: The steaks were alright, nothing special. The desserts were good. It's worth the price, but not the wait, so go if you're planning on going early, but not if you're planning on waiting in the queue. The service is definitely not worth it (and given they only do ONE dish, you'd think they'd be WAY more organized than they actually are). And honestly, I had a better steak at La Petite Maison (and hey they actually take reservations, so you don't have to queue). I'm beginning to think that Londoners actually just really like queuing, regardless of the quality of product they'll be receiving (Monmouth coffee anyone?). Herd mentality, maybe? I don't know, but I'll be dining elsewhere for steak thank you.",

Seeing the servers and how they dealt with keeping the steak warm was interesting. I like the idea of keeping the meat warm - I personally think it's a waste to let a juicy, oozing piece of meat turn into a cold steak with congealed fat.Would come back again with a friend if they waned, but probably not by myself anytime soon due to the inconvenience factor.",

    "text": "Perhaps it's a case of the Yelp curse- a well-rated restaurant with reviews that set your expectations so high, even a great restaurant couldn't possibly live up to the hype- but I wasn't all that impressed. If you stumbled on this restaurant and had no idea what it was, you'd probably rate it 2 stars. Why? Let's see. After waiting outside (not terrible I must admit) you're rushed into a jam-packed restaurant, only to be sat at a table so close to the one next to it that it must be pulled all the way out before it's shoved back trapping you in the booth. Then you're met by a \"waitress\" who appears to be dressed for Halloween who asks only \"how do you want it cooked.\" At this point you had better have figured out you're there for steak, or you're screwed. They then scribble your preference on a paper table cloth and are gone. Someone else comes by less than 30 seconds later, throws a forgettable salad down and disappears. Five minutes later a different waitress returns, tosses down a plate of steak smothered in watery green sauce and overcooked, soggy fries and is gone. Sure you get two servings, but I'd trade quality over quantity any day. In short:Service? Non-existent, and my standards are low. Steak? I've had better off a George Foreman grill. Green sauce? Seemed a bit watery and rather flavorless given all the hype. This can't be the best London can do. Overall? Not terrible, but certainly not five stars. I thought the meal was \"good,\" but certainly not exceptional. Full disclosure: I lived in Texas for a few years, so maybe I'm biased, but I've had better steak at even upscale chain restaurants like Ruth's Chris, and better fries at Five Guys. Go for the experience, if you must, but set expectations accordingly.",

    "text": "So upon arriving at this restaurant, we realized that there was a line. What we didn't realize right away was that line went all the way around the block. My friend and I decided we'd go somewhere else. As we were about to leave, we saw them letting in 10 people so we turned back around and decided we'd stick it out. My point here is that the line goes at a moderate pace. We ended up waiting about 30-35 minutes until we were seated.The concept is simple, you sit down, you get a salad and bread as a starter, french fries and steak as the main course. You can get a second serving of the steak and fries but that's it. No thirds. The fries were delicious. I like the thin french fries instead of the thick chips they sell here in the UK. The steak was delicious and the sauce (bernaise?) was even better. I give them 5 stars for the food and 3 stars for their service. So....4 stars altogether.",

    "text": "Excellent steak and endless fries! The special sauce is really delicious! It's hard for me to pin point what's in it. I've been here a couple if times and although its not cheap, I walk out very satisfied. It's a really nice place, the service is excellent and the steak is really perfectly cooked and served. The bread, salad and fries given are also very delicious and fresh. They have perfected every item that will be served up. Great place to take someone for something nice or for a small group of friends.",

Next time I will get the rare. Other than that, the frites and wine were pure bliss.AND, for desert i had profiterol, and they were one of the most amazing desserts ever!! yum yum yum.It was quiet pricey but well worth it when you have great company.",

I thought about asking for ketchup and was quickly shot down. They take their food seriously here and so they should. The green sauce is amazing on its own,with the perfectly cooked steak and with the fries. The waitresses outfits are also cool ;)",
