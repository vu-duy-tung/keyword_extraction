Main dish - well cooked Bream with boring potato, greens and a really basic tomato sauce (saut\u00e9ed onion and puree....and little else). Cheese board was the biggest course of all (wrong) and was cold! Overall: competent yet dull. Nice space though.",

    "text": "The St Pancras Grand does old-school, and it does it very well. If the food were any cheaper, it would certainly merit five stars, but here you get exactly what you pay for (it is, you might say, reassuringly expensive). In fact, when I ate here I found everything to be pretty much exactly what I expected. From the decor (reassuringly old-school) to the service (reassuringly attentive) to the menu (reassuringly English) and the prices (see above). A little more about the service: it was superlative, probably the best thing about the place. When you're running a restaurant inside a railway station, where people may have a train to catch and limited time on their hands, you have to have staff who are (unobtrusively) attentive and quick to respond to the customer's every need. That's exactly what you get at the Grand. I only had time for a quick single course (smoked haddock with crushed potatoes, poached egg and mustard butter - \u00a316 + service) and a kir royale (which was excellent, as one would expect from an establishment which is basically an extension to Europe's biggest champagne bar). The food was excellent, cooked to perfection. There wasn't that indefinable extra zing which the very best chefs somehow impart to their food, and which would truly merit a five-star review, but like I said, it was worth every penny of the \u00a316 (total bill, including the kir royale and service, was just over \u00a330). I shall definitely be back here soon, and hope to sample more of the menu including their \u00a318.47 fixed meal.",

Situated next to the Eurostar, one sits in heated booths sipping champagne as travelers come and go from various destinations. There are many champagnes to select from, by glass or bottle. Food is served as well but not recommended. You come for the champagne and the atmosphere. As you sit under the vaulted glass inside St. Pancras, I get nostalgic and remember my youth traveling around Europe by train. This is a great place to start any evening and a sure way to impress your date.",

It completely fits with the whole old-school glamour of travel concept, and since the Eurostar is a short enough journey to be relatively stylish on, you can come here and see yourself as a femme fatale, sexier version of Brief Encounter. Champagne is around \u00a310 a glass for the cheaper stuff which I would say was well worth it if you're getting an evening train into the sunset for some wildly romantic sojourn in Paris or, like, Derby. The trouble is, it is just a bar on a train platform with a bit of perspex between you and all the rest. Plus there are booths and not a really long bar to sit at, making it's claim to be the longest champagne bar in the whole wide world ever (or something) seem a little bit so what.",

The bar is adjacent to the rail tracks so you get to see the high-speed trains roll in and out of the station....I'm still not sure if that is romantic or just bizarre, so I'll go with bizarrely romantic to describe the ambiance. St Pancras itself is a gorgeous station with a massive glass curved roof that lets in lots of light. At sunset it is quite remarkable. By far this is the best place to have a drink before your train. Great selection of bubbles with actually semi-reasonable prices.However, if you are not about to board a train for the continent, this bar is quite the let down and not recommended. The website and promotional materials claim this is Europe's longest champagne bar but as the other reviewers note, the bar itself is not very big, but rather there is an endless row of booths that make the bar as long as a full train. I happened to be here for an event (and was not boarding a train) and was disappointed with the bar...it has an awkward layout and for casual drinks it's just a bizarre setting.

Aside from the bar, this place is truly awful. I was the waiter for our table. The restaurant was empty, there were plenty of staff yet I had to get up and top up glasses, and get up to fetch the waiter when we needed a drink.The food was SHOCKING. I am not a fussy customer nor a food snob. I took one bight of my steak burger (which is just a normal burger) and instantly returned it to the kitchen. The meat was cooked to a char and i think the bun was over a week old. I never return food. I figured that it was more of a fish restaurant anyway so I asked for the prawns instead. When they arrived, some were still frozen. Un-be-lievable.The service was awful. Not only did our waiter smell like a sardine factory on a hot summers day but he didn't even know his own menu. This is, of course, when he decided to grace us with his attention. The prices here are extortionate. I wouldn't pay more than 8\u00a3 for anything on this menu yet they feel it's worth an average \u00a318 per course. This restaurant needs to change hands. It's a beautiful art deco venue so maybe it needs to just become a bar, but what ever is going on right now needs to be put a stop to. F**** this place... there, I said it!

If you can't be bothered to read this whole review/rant, I'll sum it up for you in three alliterative words...shambolic, stingy and surprising (that it wasn't better).\u00a325 each for a glass of champagne, tea or coffee, finger sandwiches, scones and cakes isn't exactly a cheap, and what with the fancy gold ceiling etc, I was expecting a decent showing. Um, nope.Service was slightly shambolic. Having been shown to the table by the receptionist lady, six of us were abandoned at our table for ten to fifteen minutes before anyone came over to ask who we were and what we were having. Unfortunately, the staff betray a lack of training - for example, it's not appropriate to advertise the price of the afternoon tea to all the guests already seated, when it's clear that it's a party of people were being entertained by one of the group. In general, they're a miserable bunch of sods. Oh oh, some look like they've been watching Grange Hill for tips on how to tie a tie. Stupid.The tea selection was, just, meh. They didn't have a menu, the waiter stumbled over them as he tried to remember each one (Earl Grey, Assam, Darjeeling, Green Tea, Peppermint Tea, Fresh Mint Tea) ending with: \"...and we also have a fruit tea, which, you know, is not good.\"\"What, you mean it's horrible?\"\"Yes.\"Way to sell your product, fella. Our orders also got mixed up, peppermint tea instead of green tea, cold coffee. Not very reassuring.Sandwiches - three finger sandwiches each. No more. NO MORE. NO MORE FATSO. No, you are not allowed any extras. Unless of course you pay for them. Fillings were smoked salmon, chicken salad, and what on inspection looked like grated cheese and tomato, just like your mum used to make for your lunchbox at school. Except I think they may have run out of cheese and grated a stick of butter instead, such was the lack of flavour.Scones - warm, lovely texture. But there was only one each. One. They should call this place Scrooges.Cakes - Two slivers of sponge cake. One chocolate, one plain. Blah. Two tartlet things, filled with gloopy custard and fruit. The tea was fine, just an unadventurous selection.I know it's not fair comparing it to The Dorchester, but it just isn't in the same league, or planet. I implore you, if you're going for afternoon tea, save up your money and go somewhere else instead.",

This is a really beautiful room in that arty style I can never tell is deco or nouveau. This is something I need to work on. The staff were friendly and polite, and we were looked after very well. The literary dinners are \u00a355 for three courses with a glass of wine which seems rather pricey to me, although we were all greeted with a champagne cocktail on arrival and the bottles seemed to be free-flowing throughout, so maybe they'd noted it wrong. We had duck to start which was delicious, served with a beetroot coulis which I avoided, and a horseradish creme which I inhaled. We had a really good red wine which I forgot to note down, but which managed to be punchy without being overpowering. Similarly inhaled was the sea bream with fragrant, crispy potatoes and a really delicious sauce to dip them in, and an astonishingly decadent toffee and chocolate tart with honeycomb ice cream and caramel sauce. For puds like this, really you have to take your daily WeightWatchers points allowance and put it in a cupboard, lock it and throw away the key and hurrah! I did. I've never been remotely impressed with restaurants at train stations, and why I certainly wouldn't detour here for dinner, if I were catching the Eurostar or had just descended and didn't have awful train hair and someone was picking up the bill, I would find it a wildly romantic place to eat.",

By evening it's a classy joint wth great food, excellent service and a super choice of drinks . . . . . the champagne list is almost as long as the legendary bar outside! We arrived for a second sitting booking (post 9pm) and our party was a flexible feast with more people ariving - the staff accomodated us by adding seats and settings to our table . . . with consumate charm and good grace. We had champagne to drink - what else?! - then moved to our table. We had Rock Oysers to start - huge, soft, fresh and served with shallot vinegar and red and green tabasco. One of our party was a vegetarian with allergies to almost every foodstuff known to humankind. The staff could not have been more accommodating and plied said person with oodles of crudite and various dressings, dips and sauces for flavour and amusement. The white Rioja complemented the Oysters perfectly. For the main course we cleaved neatly into two with half the table ordering steak and chips, the other half opting for liver and mash. The red Rioja was a hit - big bleeding red fruit, perfect with meat. One of the Liver eaters was heard to mutter that there wasn't enough Liver (there was, it was just too yummy!) . . . hey presto the kitchen conjured up some more, gratis. Impressve! Our 'veggie' friend was served up a dish made to her spec - an off-menu dish cooked to order? Uheard of - and was delightfully considerate of the kitchen too. The steak was delicious . . . . medium rare, the chips were huge and chunky but crisp too . . . yum. The Liver was reportedly soft and rich whilst the mash elicited many oohs and aaahs. I had ice-cream for pudding - by that stage I didn't much care what anyone else had . . . . I had recessed into childhood as the fresh strawberry and nutty vanilla flavours swirled in my mouth . . . . heaven. The bill was a reassuring \u00a380 a head . . . we weren't left feeling disappointed, far from it. St Pancas Grand satisfies. Hell, I can go better than that; St Pancras Grand excels beautifully.",

The art deco interior design is breathtaking, and somehow - combined with its train station location - makes you feel as if you have stepped back in time and are dining in the 1920s. I almost wanted to slap on some rouge, wear a pensive expression and light a cigarette to fully embrace the moment....until I remembered that I detest smoking. The food was delicious too. I went for the two courses for \u00a320 option. The portions weren't huge, but not stingy. The service was efficient and polite, though certainly not friendly. Despite the opulent setting, I would probably recommened this restaurant as a good business lunch venue, rather than a 'will you marry me' type of place. Mind you, I'd be quite happy for someone, ANYONE, to propose to me in a Wetherspoons right now .... ;)",

Myself, well I took to waltzing about the station as though I had just stepped out of 'Brief Encounter'. The temptation to have a glass of Champagne in the world's longest bar (bit of an odd achievement that one) was too much for me and I quickly dragged my boyfriend to a couple of stools and flicked through the menu. Our waiter was absolutely charming and very happy to offer us a few suggestions. I was impressed when these included a few of the cheaper glasses as well as the high end stuff. Maybe he'd seen through my Brief Encounter disguise and realised this was actually a one off special occasion for us, or maybe he was just a lovely man that cared more about finding us something we would enjoy than something that would cost a lot of money. Either way he had me smitten.",

The menu had a great selection and it was nice to see smaller versions of several mains; good for those calorie counting.We had a helpful and very bubbly service.

After about ten minutes of waiting for service, I approached the bar to place my order. The bar was not busy, and there were four servers on staff. One of the waiters (younger blond man) blatantly ignored me as I waited and even gave a friendly wave so as to acknowledge my presence. Once the drinks were brought to my table, my companion and I were not approached for refills, food orders, or even the cheque. I'd like to point out that other tables were receiving service the entire time. The service was was the worst I've received in the U.K.",

The mash was delicious with some pepper. The Philly cheesesteak took forever to arrive and was only vaguely satisfying (flavors not particularly complex). The fries were quite good if a bit bland. The bok choy is pretty good, although you only get one head of it as a side, which is a bit cheap. Pricey for the quantity and quality, I recommend going somewhere when you've got time to kill at St Pancras and you're hungry. Unless you want potatoes, in which case I highly recommend ordering a side of fries or a side of mash.",

The art deco features make you feel like you're stepping back in time. Sit in a heated banquette booth in winter and pretend you're about to head off to Paris on the next Eurostar. Or, if you're like me, perch yourself at the bar itself and guarantee your champagne glass will always be topped up by the attentive wait staff. (This only works if you bought a bottle, of course.) There's a whole indoor restaurant that is equally glamorous, if not more so, than the outside area. But nothing beats the chin wagging and people-watching you can do from the vantage point of your bar-seated ivory champagne tower. As far as food goes, everything I've ever had was excellent, but some items represented better value than others. The large meat and cheese platters had high-quality items in abundance, at a snip (about \u00a315-\u00a318). The breakfast plates were tasty and of great quality, but one might balk at paying \u00a37 for two poached eggs on a piece of brown toast. That is, if one wasn't already tipsy from drinking champagne at 10am.All in all, my favourite place to drink champagne in London.",

Located on the upper concourse of St Pancras Station, this place is stylish, sophisticated, and nothing like what you'd expect from a neighbor of the Eurostar. The sleek white table top bar and dining area are alluring- if not inviting. The bubbly itself is the reason for coming here, and they have a little something for everyone. Options range from the affordable \u00a38.95 glass of Grande Tradition Brut to the forever extravagant \u00a31500 bottle of Nebuchadnezzar Taittinger Brut R\u00e9serve. Most prices hover around \u00a313.50 a glass and it's worth every pound. The French 75 (cocktail consisting of Greenall's gin, lemon juice topped with Champagne) was literally the best thing I've ever had and no place I've been to subsequently has been able to recreate it. Even well established cocktails bars which aren't surrounded by extensive public transport. The menu is clever and fitting, ensuring that you have the choice of lobster or caviar, luxurious French cheese, and smoked salmon. My only suggestion to them is adding scrambled eggs. They have something called the Bubble Hour, which basically means some half priced flutes after 8pm. It's almost enough to make you miss your train to Paris...",

It ended up being a great idea, it was much quieter up in the champagne bar, so it made our wait feel more relaxing. We opted for glasses of the two cheapest champagnes, and even though they were the cheapest, they were still delicious. Yes, it may seem a little pricey, but honestly every thing in London is expensive and champagne in my hometown is very expensive, so keeping that in mind, it was almost a deal. Overall I was very happy with our decision to choose champagne over coffee and vote for you to do the same!",

    "text": "I confess, it's not a regular tipple of mine but still, every now and then it's a nice way to spend an evening (or afternoon).I believe the bar is actually called Searcy's but Grand Champagne Bar is a pretty good description of just what this place is about anyway. Plush looking with a central bar area and two long, narrow stems of seating reaching out from either side ensures that this bar covers quite an area. Service is available at the bar but table service is the norm here and the staff have been attentive in my experience.Obviously the sparkly stuff is the order of the day here and they have it in abundance from prices as low as one could reasonably expect from a classy establishment all the way up to the bottles which may as well be marked 'Are you having a laugh?'. Numerous nibbles as well as some cocktails are also available.There is an inside bar here too, which I haven't been in to yet, so expect a review update when this happens. This is more likely now that winter is blustering in and the platform/outside (but not out-outside) bar does get chilly. We left our coats on last time but it'll only get more discomforting in the really wintry months.Also, just a note on the service. Last time I was here, midway through a bottle a bill was dumped on our table and payment or a bank card for a tab was more or less demanded. Clearly quite disgruntled at being interrupted like this - it was done rather discourteously - apologies were forthcoming and complimentary snacks were also brought out after a brief remonstration but the act was more than a little unexpected. An equivalent would be inviting a person over to your house and then bringing the vacuum cleaner out when you're done with them. We were reassured a little that it has become more of a standard practise for them as a number of customers have fled without paying their bill. Though I understand this and I'll learn to be less affronted should it happen again, the situation could have been avoided if approached more tactfully. So now you know.Aside from that one incident - proper lush!TTFNIan",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere and the build out housed inside the working train station, truly worth a visit of you love train stations and/or champagne. Overpriced, but you're paying for the service & the novelty. Unfortunately the service sucked. Two champagnetenders together poured our flights when really one person should have been doing it. The man assisting accidentally poured the wrong champagne into the wrong glass, I could tell he noticed he effed up but he didn't say anything. I didn't mention it (I was with mymom & she's already a little high maintenance) but I really thought he should have owned up to his mistake, especially given the painstakingly careful pours & the high prices.No matter, they will always do a brisk business due to the great location & the stunning interior & exterior architecture.",

    "text": "Situated on the upper concourse of St Pancras station this is a great place to eat either side of a journey given its proximity to the Eurostar terminal and HS1 to Kent.The interior is of old school station restaurant style, although it is not as grand as Paris's Le Train Bleu in Gare de Lyon. The food is excellent if a little pricey, I always favour the steak burger which is about \u00a315, and the service is great too. The size of the restaurant means that no booking is necessary.",

My wife had scallops that were perfectly prepared. Service started out slow - but got better. The woman that seated us was a real gem. I'd recommend this place wholeheartedly.",

    "text": "This is a fun way to start off your evening if you've got money to burn. I joined a few friends for a cheerful night out and we had a wonderful bottle of Champagne at the St Pancras Grand Champagne Bar. My only reservation is the cost, \u00a399 for one bottle is quite a markup. I understand businesses need to make a profit however this is a bit on the extreme side in my humble opinion.This is a fun place to make your own party and enjoy some nice bubbles but remember it'll take some deep pockets y'all to keep the cheers flowing. This American Southerner enjoys a good glass of bubbly like most but at this price I could jump on the Eurostar and sip champagne in Paris for just a little more. Au revoir y'all and save up your quid if you're gonna sip champagne by the train.",
