    "text": "Just a stone's throw away from Old Street Tube station, Thai Thai East is conveniently located on the Old Street, and hard to miss. The interior decor is interestingly vibrant, and reminds me a little of Thai Square, altho with less of the pomp. Our group of six diners ordered A LOT of food for this meal. It was a farewell dinner for one of our friends who was visiting from abroad, and we were all hungry. Sadly, I cannot rave about most of the dishes at this restaurant: Starters The Thai Thai Platter is great for sharing, and decent enough in taste, but hardly impressive (if you're a cynic like me, you'd know you can get these frozen from Wing Yip and they'd taste exactly the same, if not better). Thai salads like Som Tham (papaya salad) were bland and a huge disappointment - rather pricey, if you think about how bland it tastes! The Larb (minced chicken salad) was decent, and by far the best salad dish available. Don't bother ordering the seafood salad - it's practically the worst I've ever had, with no hint of vermicelli whatsoever, and a strong overdose of onions. They've got the equation all wrong! Soup We ordered the Po-Tak (min for 2), which was well presented in a little steamboat with a flame under it, to keep the soup warm. Although the portions says it's for 2, do not be deceived - we could not finish it, even though there were 6 of us! It's not a bad soup.. much like Tom Yum, but truly.. it is quite bland. We all agreed we'd had much better elsewhere. But if you want to order group soup, then this is probably the most economical way to do it.. (\u00a310.95) and you'll have left-overs, rather than order individual portions at \u00a34.95. We ordered quite a selection of main courses since we were all hungry, and curious to sample what the restaurant had to offer. Beef: Sau Rong Hai (Weeping Tiger), a grilled beef dish is supposed to be moist and tender, but this came out dry and tough. Duck:We ordered one duck dish which also turned out rather dry and tough, and portions were small. Green Curry: It's almost impossible to go wrong with green curry.. so, we ordered a Chicken Green Curry.. nice enough, but again, no wow factor there. As expected, it was decent. Seafood: However, I'd highly recommend ordering the red curry River Prawns, as the prawns are huge and succulent (forget ordinary prawns.. you seldom get prawns this big in other restaurants!)... Fish dishes were very good - we order Choo Chee sea bass (funnily enough, all their fish dishes were sea bass), and another steamed fish with lime & spicy sauce (this was excellent, and by far the best dish). Phad Thai: If you love Phad Thai, then I strongly recommend you order it at this restaurant - it has got to be the best Phad Thai I've had in a long while - the noodles are moist yet not soggy, and the flavours are just right. Most restaurants do their Phad Thai too dry, and the noodles tend to stick together else, they're too soggy. I'd go back to this restaurant just for the Phad Thai, but probably nothing else.. Prices are not cheap at Thai Thai East - we managed to get a deal on Toptable which gave us 50% off for food, but that does not include drinks or desserts, and these can severely add on to your bill, even if you're a non-alcoholic drinker. In the end, we paid \u00a321 each for the meal, which, without the Top Table offer would have probably come closer to \u00a335 each. Not exactly good quality for such a meal I will not be rushing back to Thai Thai East, not unless someone organized a dinner get-together, but even then.. I'd be reluctant to spend my money there. There are better Thai restaurants out there which won't cost you an arm and a leg for very mediocre food.",

As for the food itself, the two dishes I had were good, the green curry was very nice, although the salad on the side was more of an after thought and not the freshest I have ever seen, but that is forgivable as the curry was the thing I was eating. The decor was what I imagined would be quite Thai and interesting and although I was there very early on a Tuesday, I can imagine that it would be quite a good place for a group of friends a little later in the evening.",

You have to order a starter and main course for each diner and in exchange it is half price. 24 dishes so we did a good sampling of the menu. I get the feeling that most diners are there on some sort of deal \u00a0its always busy whenever I wander by which is frequently. Despite the good reviews I think the food here is ordinary at best \u00a0bland and the batter fried dishes were frankly poor \u00a0takes a lot for the kids to turn their noses up at deep fried soft shell crab or squid \u00a0but they did. Curries too sweet, not enough heat.

The chicken in my soup was incredibly tender - often you get overcooked chicken in soups, but this tasted like it had been delicately poached and then added to the soup for serving. For the main I chose phad ke moe chicken, which is \"stir fried flat rice noodles with holy basil leaves and chili\" - it came packed with more chicken and veggies than noodles. Man, they were not kidding about the chili. The menu has two red chilies next to this dish, which means it is hot, but it was really making my whole mouth numb.",

We ordered on the tptable 50% offer, bear in mind that you need to order a starter and main each on this deal which is more food than I wanted. The starters of thai fishcakes and duck spring rolls tasted fresh and were filled with meat rather than cheap filler such as beansprouts. Sadly it went a bit downhill from there. The curries all tasted a bit sickly sweet as though they had been finished with pure sugar. Normally I love the balance between sweet, sour, hot and salty in thai food but here everything just tasted sweet, so much so that I felt a bit ill after eating it. We ordered 5 different curries so I don't think this was bad luck or bad ordering. I would probably wouldn't go back.",

What kind of Thai restaurant runs out of Thai iced tea?! My friend and I split the appetizer tray for two. The chicken satay had a gross after-taste that reminded me of lighter fluid. The fish cakes were dry. For my main course, I ordered the pad see ew with beef. The whole dish was dry and bland and the beef was overcooked. For dessert, I was tempted to order one of the cakes but I had been disappointed all night so I just ordered the Chrysanthemum tea. The tea turned out to be a pleasant surprise--very refreshing and just the right amount of sweet.I would have given Thai Thai 2 stars if it wasn't for the Chrysanthemum tea.",

The decor was lovely with authentic glasswork, wooden carvings and big windows giving a light and spacious feel and the service was friendly and attentive. Our Singapore Slings while we were deciding what to order were fruity, helped by the blackberry on top and with a decent kick. Starters of Crab, Prawns and \"golden chicken parcels\" were pretty good. The chicken could have had more spice for me and the Crab was described as \"a bit like KFC\", although I'm not sure that was entirely an insult... The enormous prawns were tender with perfectly done breadcrumbs and a melt in the mouth texture - definite winner, although probably leave the edible basket if you want to retain an appetite. Mains were a prawn green curry, River prawns in pumpkin red curry and a garlic and pepper seabass.The Green curry had a good flavour without being overpowering (although personally i prefer a bit more chilli kick) but it was lacking the small pea-aubergines. The pumpkin was nice although perhaps had a little too much bite to it and the butterflied River Prawns were tasty to begin with but had a slightly charred flavour and were very meaty which left us unable to finish them The seabass was nice if a little bit bland. Overall, it was a good meal without being outstanding, perhaps I've become too accustomed to Thai food because it's hard to be blown away by it these days but it was enjoyable none the less. It's location near Old Street is a plus though.",

We got sat in the corner table of the room where we were able to take in the sexy ambiance that Thai Thai is working with.

It was a large bunch of us but we wanted to order only two platters because several members of the group were vegetarians and had identified their own starters to order but the waitress kept insisting we should order three. We stuck our ground and got two platters and found them more than adequate! The restaurant is a fair trek from the tube stop, a good way of building an appetite. Food was served in adequate portions, dare I say, even enough in an individual portion to share across two if one is too full from starters and such. Flavours were rich and spicy and prices are good. Beware though, once the starters, wine, beer, mains and desserts are done, the prices could really start adding up, so it could even be worth considering the set menu but I can't speak for that considering I haven't ordered it myself.Good Thai food, is all I can say. Nothing to blow my mind but good enough for me to stop by again if I'm in the area.",

So, after being berrated by the lady from front of house literally speaking down to us (in raised voice), the 5 of us very nearly leaving, we finally ordered and recieved some rather lack lustre food. Dont get me wrong, it was nice, but it was lacking in flavour that you would hope a great Thai to offer.

    "text": "Delicious. Quick. Spicy. Thai Thai was one of the many Thai restaurants I have tried recently and here is my take on it. I have to begin by saying I have to say that I have only ever ordered take-away and so far I have only ever had good experiences with them. Two dishes that really stuck out to me were the Pad-Thai chicken, which was really delicious and by far one of the best ones I have tried recently, as well as the Kang Panang (chicken) which was also delicious but packed quite a bit of heat, the only thing I have to complain about was that the chili's inside my Kang Panang were chopped quite large and it did not blend well into the dish, I just picked them out, but the overall flavor was so good! Also whilst ordering I did not realize that the Kang Panang did not come with a side of rice, which considering the price I paid I just assumed would be included, but there wasn't any, which was my fault for not checking. However the food was delicious and I have to say it is one of my go to places for quick delicious Thai food.",

However I was disappointed in the Tom Kha Gai portion size for 6.95 we only received a single serving (i'm from San Francisco and this is not normal. I'm not sure what is usual in London as this is my first Thai restaurant so far). Duck curry- good, papaya salad- good, coconut rice also good. I would not use the 50% off deal again (From Toptable) as it forces you to order more food than normal for 2 people.",

    "text": "After having some pretty abysmal Thai food in London, I was happy when a friend recommended Thai Thai to me. I tried it the other night with some girlfriends and we had a lovely evening. Thai Thai has a wonderful, upscale, and somewhat romantic atmosphere and the food is great! I got the Pad Ke-Mao, a very spicy noodle dish and my friends got Pad Thai and sweet/sour chicken. We were all very pleased with our meals and my mouth was still burning for hours afterwards! The service was efficient but not very friendly, but everything came out right and promptly. Thai Thai is extremely affordable as well, especially for London. Each of our entrees were around \u00a38, and the portions were good size too! The only complaint I have about this place is the background music: American 80's music sang by one cover artist, and the CD repeated over and over and over. Despite the bad music, Thai Thai was a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "Thai Thai, my oh my.My friend is about to embark on a 4 month adventure in Thailand. \u00a0Somehow my flatmate and I thought \u00a04 months of Thai food wouldn't be sufficient enough for her to become sick of it and decided to start her trip out proper, by taking her to a Thai restaurant. \u00a0The idea was good. \u00a0The food was not. \u00a0Okay, maybe the idea wasn't good either. \u00a0My flatmate didn't get to specific about why she didn't like her food. \u00a0She simple stated, 'I always have pad kee mao at Thai restaurants, it's my default food. \u00a0This wasn't good.' \u00a0Maybe she should have changed it up this time.I, on the other hand, had green curry. \u00a0Which, might also be my default Thai restaurant food choice. \u00a0I should definitely have chosen another. \u00a0To be honest the green curry wasn't that bad. \u00a0It was a bit spicy and actually a little bland, but over all, not too bad.The service is what prompted the single-star rating. \u00a0I would have probably given this place 3 stars if they had good service. \u00a0First off, we ordered a starter. \u00a0About 7 minutes later another server came over and took our main order. \u00a0Soon after taking our main order they took away our start plates. \u00a0Please note: no where in the above paragraph did I say we received our starter.My flatmate was a little concerned about them taking away our start plates and asked the first server if he had placed the order for our superly over-priced starter. \u00a0He assured us he did. \u00a0About 10 mins later our mains came out.Once again: please notice we DID NOT receive our starter. \u00a0They eventually brought it to us but then continued to make us feel rushed. \u00a0They tried to take our plates away before we were finished, not just once, but a few times. \u00a0Granted, I can almost understand if this place is one of those sit down, eat quick, get out - type of places, but this place tried to make it seem like it was formal dining. \u00a0And to be honest, since I paid with my US bank card, it was about $30 for my meal and I only had tap water to drink, so in my eyes - it should be considered fine dining. \u00a0But, it was not.Now, if your walking down Old Street and you see this place and think, oh that looks good. \u00a0Please remember, it's over priced, mediocre, and has bad service.",

    "text": "Thai Thai East isn't a very honest restaurant to be honest. It's prices are pretty high as it took in account that many people who come here probably would have a Tastecard or go on Opentable to get 40% off. Dishes doesn't always come as it is, like our morning glory came as Chinese broccoli instead and they probably assumed we don't know better. They also have a problem with stocking fresh ingredients and keeping fresh ingredients fresh. It is a shame as they have a good kitchen that is capable of cooking quite flavoursome dishes but the poor ingredients let some of the dishes downIt is also one of those restaurant that looks more fancy than it really is with its large restaurant space, lush gold pillars, dark purple tablecloths and neatly folded maroon napkins giving it a good Thailand feel to it. It does set a nice atmosphere especially with the ambient music. Staff can be a bit forgetful and takes time to warm to you. Most of them look bored. Their service is adequate but they just need to smile more.Tod mun khow podThese had a satisfying bite to it. The spices were quite mild and lovely sweetness coming from the sweetcorn. Sadly the latter did not taste fresh and somehow produced a slight chewiness and stickiness that although was unusual, somehow added to the texture of the dish that some may enjoy. Came with sweet chilli sauce to add a nice zing to it.Tom Kha mushroom soup This was lovely. The perfect balance of sour, creamy and mild spices. It was fragrant with enough complexity to keep your tastebuds busy. Mushrooms were nice and fresh too.Pineapple fried rice This was probably the best dish of the evening although the pineapple shell they used to serve it in looked very old. The rice although was long grain, it was still cooked to a nice sticky consistency. I very much enjoyed the different flavours. The mild curry powder provided the slight kick whilst the raisins gave a lovely slow release of sweetness. The pineapple were chunky adding more moisture to the dish and a nice citrusy zest taking any stodginess away. Good texture coming from the silky stirred in scrambled eggs and crunchiness from the cashew nuts.Mussaman curry veg This was lovely and thick creamy. Probably not the most authentic seeing how sweet and mild it was but that doesn't say it wasn't amazing. It was very rich, good amount of spices and strong notes of coconut. The biggest problem was that the baby sweetcorn had gone off slightly setting a slight sour note when you bit into it. Could have been dangerous but we were quite lucky to be okay. The rest of the vegetables that including broccoli and carrots seemed fresh and still kept it crunchiness which was nice. Fried tofu puffs were nice to have, soaking up the curry sauce like a sponge until you bite into it. Potatoes fluffy and soft and nice contrast in texture from the crunchy toppings of peanuts.Morning GloryAdvertised as morning glory we were given Chinese broccoli. However we didn't bother with telling them as it was beautifully cook, fresh, crunchy and seasoned nicely with minced garlic and soy. An excellent stir fry but advertised very badly. Pad Kee Maow veg This lacked the essential wok energy it needed to make it an excellent dish. But the lovely flavours and textures still made it good enough to enjoy. Fresh silky ho fun against the sweet crunchy onions, carrots and green beans. It had more kick than the rest of the dishes with the fresh green and red chillies so be careful. The flavours of the tamarind added a nice sweet zest to it and it was garnished nicely with coriander.Overall I did enjoy my experience at Thai Thai East. The kitchen seems be skilled enough to produce some fine dishes and flavours and seasoning were always on par. However the restaurant is too big for what it can fill which makes the place look very dead and empty even with customers in it. They do try and make everyone sit near the window side to make it look fuller from the outside. Of course cooking vegetables that are off is not cool and mis-selling items without informing customers is not cool either, Therefore I find the place is only worth going if you have an offer as the prices don't match up to what they are offering. Don't forget to check in with Yelp to get your free prawn crackers too.",

It can be a bit hit and miss (the gyoza are dry and not all that) but ThaiThai's Pad Kee Mao noodles with beef are really delicious with that basil leaf flavour! The portions are not large but the taste is more than worth it.I have had the Mee Goreng noodles with chicken as well and they were nice, but nothing hits the spot for me like the Pad Kee Mao which are delicately spiced and flavourful without being too spicy. I am not a big fan of the fishcake appetisers but some of my friends can't get enough of those either. \u00a0For weekday lunch it isn't crowded but if you are taking a lot of people, maybe make a booking.",

Definitely stick to individual things if you are extra hungry (avoid the fishcakes entirely though).The main meals were a lot better. The penang particularly impressed although the massaman lacked a bit of flavour.

We had the \u00a39 lunch deal with veggie potstickers and pad kee mao (the flat 'drunken' noodles I am now so obsessed with!)The noodles were particularly tasty and there was enough to take home for a mid-afternoon snack. \u00a0Lovely decor and interesting techno Indian music. Would return!",

    "text": "The food here is fantastic. It is presented beautifully and tastes amazing.We had the meat platter for starters and loved it. We ate it between two of us but you could easily split it between three.We all enjoyed our main courses. I had the stir fry which came in a rich oyster sauce with prawns and coconut rice as was recommended on the menu. That rice stood out as the best thing of the night. Seriously. It was delicious. \u00a0Especially with the stir fry.The interior of the restaurant is pretty impressive and quite chic looking. You can tell some thought goes into presentation (of the food as well as the restaurant). It gives a good impression which the food lives up too! Only negative is that service was quite slow. Wouldn't stop me from going again though!",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place more stars because the waitress who initially served us was lovely, we both ordered \u00a0Pad Thais one with prawns and the other mixed seafood. Although the flavors were ok the noodles were overcooked and just really average. The restaurant wasn't full and there were a lot of staff on but the service was painfully slow, with some waiters even walking right past customers trying to wave them down. The lighting was very dark with techno music playing too loudly for an evening meal. We wondered whether it turned into a nightclub after a certain hour? It has potential to be a really good restaurant, with a bit of an interior makeover (it was an odd mash of modern thai and 90s disco) and some focus on getting the basic thai dishes right.",

The food was cooked perfectly and the staff were really attentive. Our wine was lovely and served at perfect temperature and the waiters kept us topped up! I'd really recommend the pad kee maow. Everything was delicious and feasted light not oily. A great place to pop in to if you're in the area :)",

    "text": "Went there with 4 other friends and booked a table for dinner earlier that morning to get 50% off the bill. During our booking, we strongly requested seats on the first floor. When we got there, the semi rude waitress told us that the first floor was full and have to bring us to the underground level- no bueno. The atmosphere is so much worst down at that little dungent. Awful. There were a wide variety of food on the menu. We each picked 2 dishes just to find out that the 50% off deal requires each customer to order one appetizer and a main. This really got on our nerves as it never says so online. We were each to order 2 dishes where the total would already cost more than app+main. One word - LAME. Appetizers were small and unfulfilling. Food came, salty as HELL. The river prawns were big but the spicy prawn dish was overly spicy and salty, and sweet. My friend's pad Thai was too sweet, and my other friend's pad see ew was too salty as well. The sea bass was TOO SALTY. It wasas if they sprinkled a jar of msg to flavor their dishes. The only good dish was the beef curry, which my friend gets every time she goes. Conclusion: nice atmosphere but dont be fooled folks!! skippable",
