The service is excellent, the maitre D Marcello is very good and very caring, kept on asking how things were. The food:'the pizzas are very good, very typical Italian with real fresh mozzarella Bufala, the trenette were very good, even for our Italina guests. The antipasto misto Italian style was excellent. The cannoli at the end for dessert were very fresh and excellent. All in all recommended by Italians from Milano.",

I mean, I know I'll never get what I want going to a touristic chain in Leicester Square, and still at 6 PM of a Sunday we end up here, in Leicester Square, with a reservation for a pizza in one of the most notorius italian pizza chains in the world. Sometimes I hate myself.Anyway, we went here early for an aperitivo, which was surprisingly better than expected (would deserve a 3 stars), a not-that-bad spritz and negroni (a bit small on the dose but.... the taste was better than expected), and dishes were good, not THAT good but at least not disappointing. The problem here is the restaurant itself, buffalo mozzarella is dry (damn, you offer a mozzarella and bla bla bla and you serve it dry, what's your problem?!), prosciutto was really bad cut (I can cut better with a knife, without even using a slicer), pizza is super salty and gummy, desserts seems a lot nicer than what they actually are.That's it, I don't like to speak about this place, it's just what it is: a super touristic place with average service, less-than-average food and inflated price. Not that bad, but definitely not a place anybody should eat. Avoid this place pleasePS: obviously the place was filled with italian tourists. Damn people, just try something else at least when you are abroad!",

We got a table that wasn't all that great and our pizza arrived before our drinks (5-10 minutes after ordering) but OH MY LAWD the pizza was good!

Watching the bar person prepare the drinks I realise we're not getting the full measure. They taste good, and the remaining 8 of us eventually get a spritz. After two more attempts to get a table the 14 of us are given the seats next to the toilet door. Ok they are busy, but this is going to be a \u00a3300 + bill. The waiter is attentive and good, but doesn't want to let us have separate starters and insists that we have a mixed plate of meats and veg. The anti-pasti we get are good, but for 10 people not 14. We all get the chance to order our own main course, we all opt for the pizza. These range in price from \u00a310 - \u00a320. Very genuine pizza tasty and although only tepid were exactly what we ordered. Ordering a beer was a task they kept forgetting, only on the third time of asking did the order get entered on the till. The bill arrives we note that there's \u00a350 worth of tip. Split by 14 it's \u00a327.33, the waiter tries to make it \u00a328. So now there's bad feeling because we've told him no. We already spent \u00a378 on the spritz. Moral of the story is to go elsewhere, it's a tourist trap, on the corner of a busy main road in Soho, lots of people, chaotic ordering, but the food is tasty.",

I under where he is coming from but we were told by another team member that it was ok. He had the nastiest attitude and it just contributed to the eventing going poorly. Once seated at our table at the back of the restaurant in a crowed area at a shit table I had to basically crawl into our booth seat and ripped by tights on the corner of the table and cut my leg. How the hell is a table end that sharp!?! Needless to say the night went from amazing to wow i wish I had just went home after the theatre. The waitress also had an attitude after the bar altercation got leaked to the rest of the staff. She kept clicking her pen waiting for me to order instead of asking if I needed more time. I've worked in the food industry for over 5 years and thank God I no longer do. It's not a for life thing. If you aren't going to be hospitable, change your profession!!

    "text": "I found myself in this busy little area between Soho and Chinatown, right in the middle of London. It was my first time ever in London and I was craving Italian food. \u00a0I stumbled across this place as I roamed the streets looking for an Italian restaurant that was still open at 22:22. Being the yelper that I am, I of course had to take a peak at their Yelp reviews. They were not bad and the photos of the food looked good, that't what I always go to. Photos of food make my mouth water. As I walked in I was quickly greeted and sat down at a table right away. The menu was pretty extensive with many options. There was a good sized wine selection with very detailed \u00a0descriptions of each wine. There was a cool outside bar area that was partially open to the street and a good place for people watching. I decided to sit inside since it was a bit cold out and I wanted to sit in warmth and enjoy a glass of wine.I am a sucker for the lasagna, always have been, so of course I ordered that. I am not sure what I was expecting. I guess I thought since London was a lot closer to Italy than Texas the food would be that much better. Umm, I am going to say no. The meat lasagna was't bad. It had a good flavor, it just wasn't anything memorable. I would eat here again and try something else as there were many great dishes I would have loved to try also.",

Obviously my instant reaction was \"this is clearly a tourist trap, it can't be good\" but soon was I yet again to learn that you should never judge a book by its cover. We were taken upstairs and provided with a table. The wine began to flow (Marco's choice - it's was a lovely dry white) and we ordered. I couldn't see just Arancini balls on the menu so asked if this was possible - the waiter headed to check the till and returns stating, of course, they'll \u00a31.50 a ball - I'm in.Paula and I also ordered a pizza to share - toppings included ham, mushroom, artichoke and their famous buffalo mozzarella! The food arrived quickly. First the Arancini balls - they were ok but not everything I wanted them to be, lacking in some flavour and that real bite.The pizza however was wonderful. I loved that they cut it in half and put it on two plates knowing we were sharing! I loved the doughiness of the crust and I loved the toppings! Thumbs up.And to top it all off we were greeted by the owner who bought us a round of drinks - lovely man! So who knew, good quality, authentic Italian slap bang in the middle of the tourist trap!",

Not much atmosphere but I would assume that it has more of a buzz in the evening. We were seated and had our orders taken promptly. The starter came swiftly - the Cuoppo Tradizionale - I don't eat dairy so I only had the barest of nibbles at this but along with my companion I found the items overly oily. Unfortunately most of it went to waste; some tourists sitting behind us having the same dish also left the majority behind.There was a longish wait for the main courses to arrive. I wasn't overly hungry and just needed a light bite, with a dearth of dairy free options on the menu I went for the Minestrone soup. It was nice but nothing special, also could have arrived at a warmer temperature.Overall service wasn't the friendliest. Pricing standard for a touristy area.Probably won't return as there are better \u00a0& more dependable Italian's in the area.",

When you go inside you can see the bar table and the food exposed inside, and you can see the quality of the food: amazing.The prices are a little high but the quality is equal to them.The choices in the menu are not soo many but they are the best of the italian cousine, i have ordered the focaccia with aglio e olio and the taste is superlative! It's a good choice with even the little mozzarella bocconcini if you want to break the hunger.The best part was the pizza with mozzarella and one day i have ordered with the bufalo one, and both were amazing! The taste is about the REAL pizza without too many tops, the basil and the mozzarella are fresh and the tomato souce is the best i ever taste here in London.The last but not least: the dessert with tiramis\u00f9 and coffe: the first is the REAL tiramis\u00f9 where you can taste the coffe, the chocolate, savoiardi and even the liquor, best quality and even your stomach feels well!If you want to take someone inside an italian restaurant, this must be the first choice!",
