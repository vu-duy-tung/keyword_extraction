    "text": "I came here every weekend either Friday or Saturday night during June, July and August. I became some what of a regular. The food is amazing and so authentic. My friend who is West Indian absolutely loved this place. Between us both, we have tried quite a few things on the menu. For starters we have had Jerk Chicken Wings with scotch bonnet swamp sauce. The jerk marinade was spot on, the chicken wings, were so moist and well cooked but not over cooked. I found the scotch bonnet swamp sauce a bit too spicy for me so only tried a little bit. The jerk fried chicken thighs with bajan hot pepper sauce, again the jerk marinade was spot on and the chicken thighs again were so moist and well cooked. From the mains we have had Jerk Chicken Supreme with grilled chicken breast, sweet potato & yam mash or rice & peas, saut\u00e9ed callaloo & spinach, jerk gravy. We have tried both variations from the menu and the one we liked the most was sweet potato & yam mash. This tasted very similar to what my Jamaican neighbour would make, but her one is slightly more spicier, so it is authentic which was good to see and quite rare nowadays. We have also tried the Curried Mutton with rice, peas & slaw. My friend absolutely loved this, I liked it but was not too keen on it. The mutton was cooked just how I like it and was so tender, the rice and peas were again cooked just how I like it. I did like the slaw a lot and would quite happily order that next time. We haven't tried any of the burgers as we weren't too keen on them as they were not authentic West Indian food. We have tried all the sides and were impressed with them all. As for the alcohol, I have had quite a few myself and tried a fair few my friend ordered. I have had the Wray Cobbler which has my favourite rum Wray and Nephew with Bergamot, Fino Sherry, Lime and Sugar. This is my favourite cocktail as the flavours just complemented each other really well and the fact it has my favourite rum makes me slightly biased. I have also had the Trader Vic's Mai Tai which has Appleton VX, Appleton 12, Wray and Nephew, Agricole, Curacao, Orgeat, Sugar syrup & Lime. I do like Mai Tai so I just got this to see how they make it and I was thoroughly impressed, it didn't taste very alcoholic which is not a good thing for me as if it doesn't taste alcoholic then I tend to drink them very quickly and get very drunk very quickly as a result. I got the Romero Zombie which I got strictly because it came in a coconut shell and just looked amazing, it had some rums and was quite fruity. I really liked this one and have had it numerous times now. I also enjoy the dark and stormy, that was really full bodied and best I've ever had. As I have spent a good amount of time here, I know for sure I will be back and have many more nights here as well as drinks after shopping in Oxford Street. If you want authentic West Indian food then definitely come here. If you want a rum filled night then come here, It is truly my favourite place and out of the two Rum Kitchen's, I prefer this one over the first one in Notting Hill. Also if you have managed to read this whole review then well done to you as I have just realised how long this review is!!",

The sauces and dips are excellent and a different twist on what you normally get in burger joints. The BBQ Rum and Scotch Bonnet Mayo awesome I wanted to take the bottle home with me.The staff are super friendly and up for a little banter. Despite the place being really busy, they didn't forget about us or our small requests for things like sauces.The place is quite hip and noisy, so not everyone's cup of tea. But honestly, you need to come here for the soft shell crab burger and sweet potato fries. You won't regret it!One cool thing is that when paying the bill they use an ipad app with one of those card readers that can email you the receipt. It can also evenly split the bill depending on the number in your party. That is cool to see.",

    "text": "Better than I expected it to be! If you've read any of my reviews, you probably already know how I feel about chains. Why do I keep going to some of them? Probably because London is BESIEGED by them. Kingly Court is quite close to my job so it's often a good source of food destinations but sadly due to rental prices in Carnaby Street that means all of them are chains because who else can afford to open there. We were intending to go to Dirty Bones but The Rum Kitchen caught my eye instead. At least Kingly Court does have some novel and interesting chains as opposed to the usual. It looked rather quiet inside but as soon as we stepped in the music was booming! There was a bit of a confusion in seating us but we eventually got a table at 6pm. There had a been a lot of empty tables but these quickly filled. We decided to go for the happy hour \u00a35 cocktails. Bit of a rookie mistake, my daiquiri and 'the universe' cocktail came in very small glasses, tasted exactly the same and were very sweet. On initial look at the menu, I was surprised at how pricey it was considering none of the dishes came with anything. I opted for the ribs and the sweet potatoes fries. With two happy hour cocktails, my meal came to \u00a325. Yeesh. Still hungry. You get two big ribs in the bowl, it was supposed to come with some pickle watermelon but I saw none of this. The ribs were good, in my opinion, but not that much sauce. A tablespoon across all of them maybe. Extortionately priced at \u00a38.50. I was glad I went for the sweet potato fries instead of the wedges, as they were a decent size for \u00a34.50. You seemed to get three wedges and a scoop of browned avocado for \u00a35. Unimpressed. Unless you order a full main course and a side, you'll still be hungry. I would have probably ordered dessert but they came over to give us the bill and tell us to vacate the table as there was a booking. Nice. They never told us this when we sat down.",

Saw the sign for The Rum Kitchen and practically ran up the stairs. Once inside, it had such a cool vibe. Dim lighting, cool beachy-esque decor, and fantastic music playing. Went up to the bar and I picked the first thing on the menu that I laid my eyes on.. \"Rattle skull punch.\" The bartender was great, tossing around the bottles quite swiftly and chatting to us while he made our drinks. The drink I ordered was served in a mug, which I loved and garnished with mint and an orange slice. The taste was extremely unique, but absolutely delicious and quite strong (all make a great combination!). I highly recommend this place for a chill drink prior to going out or just to socialize with friends! Definitely will be back.",

I'm happy to pay over \u00a39 for their perfectly crafted cocktails but \u00a313.50 for a jerk chicken meal with next to no veg is extortionate, especially seeing as it doesn't taste very authentic. Real Caribbean portions are generous with sides of veg and hard food (plantain or festival) as standard. The friendly staff, joyful atmosphere and great selection of tunes is what saves this place.",

Not to mention my saltfish fritters were possibly the best appetizer I have ever tasted. Other than everyone I ate with saying our drinks were prompt, our drinks perfect enough so to get a ssecond round of them, the food came so much later. Ans to complain about the speed, I guess you cannot rush supreme Excellency! Because I just want to come back here and order more food. Slow yes. But alas worth the wait!",

The manager gave us 10% off our bill as a friendly gesture, which he didn't need to do! so the service is really great here.

The first time I went I had the jerk chicken leg with rice and peas which came with gravy and it was divine. The chicken was tender and flavoured really well as was the rice and peas. The second time I went, I had a chicken burger and shared sweet potato fries and jalape\u00f1o poppers with my boyfriend. All of the food was again, delicious, I could not fault it. The cocktails are also pretty good, all of them having rum as one of the main ingredients in it. The vibe of the place is pretty relaxed with the decor being reminiscent of a restaurant/shack from the Caribbean. The staff are great, nice and friendly and I would definitely go back again - especially as it's just off of Carnaby Street!",

The charcoal roasted red pepper stuffed with quinoa, mixed beans, carrot, coconut puree & crispy shallots was a satisfying and delicious meal - loved the hint of coconut and crispy texture of the shallots.The Jerk Fried Chicken had my friend in absolute food heaven, if I ate chicken I would have ordered this!Plantains are a must, get this as a side. The watermelon and cucumber salad was refreshing though very simple and not necessary as we already had so much food.Although the roasted sweet potato wedges, avocado, and toasted coconut flakes sounds amazing, it actually was not a very appetizing combination. I wouldn't order this.I would book a table as it is busy during peak times. Come with a few friends and have some rum cocktails.",

Now, that hopefully done, order a round of Zombies and get sloshed! The Zombie packs a hell of a punch, and is very worth the pricey tag of neatly \u00a313 each. Dinner Rush hits hardest Thurs-Sat 6pm-8/9pm, so beware if casually dropping in! Also Happy Hour runs here (I think till 7pm) early in the week, so be clever and get in early.+ Food is awesome. The chicken burger was Deceptively delicious, and very filling. I almost didn't need the tasty sweet potatoe fries. My mate had the jerk chicken main dish and wasn't enough for him, so definitely order sides! + Cocktails are all generally quite good quality. Order away!+ Decor is good, and if possible try sit at the window ledge and watch all the action in Kingley Square.+ Staff are good fun and jovial! Definitely a lot less uppity than the Rum Kitchen in my back yard of Portabello. If any negatives, it's not the cheapest eats, but it's a solid spot. Pop down to Cahoots after for some vintage Tube-themed cocktails after.",

Music was quite good...mainly reggae, very fun. It was quite busy so might be better to book in advance if u wanna go for this place.

However, as luck would have it, after pitching up unannounced we managed to get ourselves a table... Ya man.Walking in here you feel the buzz of the place, lots of conversation and the ambience sets off a chatty relaxed vibe. Having been shown to our table by our host we sat down to peruse the menu, we decided that instead of main courses we instead needed a little selection of nibbles to satisfy us, plus we like to share, else we get food envy!Rachel's doing her own research peering at the other tables food whilst I looked at the menu...I was disappointed that water came in The Kraken glass bottle.. It didn't stop me having Jack Sparrow disillusions when I drank from it though.. Indeed, why is the rum always gone?So \u00a0we eventually came to decide on three of the small plates to share...Jerk Chicken Wings with Scotch Bonnet Swamp Sauce, maybe the largest chicken wings I've had, these were seriously soft and devilishly sticky with a decent amount of chicken for a little wing! And the Swamp Sauce was as badass as it sounds.Island Spiced Baby Squid, piled high for such a small plate but neither of us complained. This was the softest squid I've eaten in London encased in the light crispy coating it was cooked perfectly. The Scotch-Bonnet mayo dip gave it the kick it needs to deserve its place in the Rum Kitchen and don't forget to squeeze the lime!Sticky BBQ Ribs had more than the usual, sticky sauce on a bone that I find with most ribs, they were meaty and I had no struggle to tear it all off. I love ribs, they demand to be picked up, leaving you with sticky, saucy fingers, the delight of eating is getting messy and indulging in licking your fingers, getting the last bits of meat off the bone and losing the lady like demeanour mostly required in social situations.I'll definitely be heading back for a main course, the curried mutton looked and smelled amazing!C.x",

Really enjoyed my jerk chicken although beware it is quite hot. I needed a few glasses of water. Wish I'd gonna for yam and sweet pot mash rather than rice and peas as they were a bit dry.Cocktails also good! Really tasty and pretty glasses - they have happy hour from 5-7 with 5 cocktails each for \u00a35. Quite varied choice so make most of that.Get the plantain - they are sooo yum! My friend who had crab burger also highly rated it! Staff were also very friendly and I loved the decor and the location of the restaurant in kingly courtI personally think the price for the mains is a bit steep - \u00a313 for a curry or some chicken and rice?! And was nearly going to give it 3* because of this but it doesn't do the food and service justice.Highly recommended! Might try the Notting Hill branch next time!",

It's obviously a tiny place - and because of that I think I'd enjoy it more for lunch than a weekend dinner. The food was decent but the plantain not sweet enough for me. Still, we had good times here as a group and some rather indecent chat!",

Was looking forward to it as I've heard so many reviews. Took about 20 minutes for someone to get our drink orders and a further 30 minutes for food, which in the end wasn't even worth paying for. The jerk wings are probably the only starter I'd have again. The fish fritters were too big and very very bland, think the chef had a bad day and forgot all the seasoning, won't be having that again. The calamari was ok, kind of tastes the same everywhere you go. The jalapeno poppers, the cheese is meant to me oozing out and well served hot too, it came out cold. Sweet potato fries are standard everywhere you go too. Drinks were ok, the mains actually looked a whole lot better, so will probably go back just for that. Maybe I wouldn't go back to carnaby street as the staff just looked so miserable and unpleasant. I might try the Notting Hill branch next time instead. If it's like this during a busy period, I'd hate to see what a slow period is like for them. Maybe they need to get backup temporary staff.",

It had open windows and colorful decor which attracted us to this place. We decided to eat here and it was a really good decision. I got the jerk chicken with plantains. The plantains were delicious. They were cooked perfectly and I loved the sweet jam that they gave me as the dipping sauce. It was so flavorful and added to the natural sweetness of the plantain. The jerk chicken was tender and I loved the sides. They gave us a really good gravy! It had a really good heat level and complimented the dish very well! The service was good and the ambiance was on point. I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for something spicy and heavy!",

After waiting for about 10 minutes they thankfully were able to find us a table. For starters we had the spicy fried wings and the fried squid (the wings were okay, but the squid was yummy). I tried one of their happy hour cocktails (the punch) which tasted watered down to me. For the mains we tried:- jerk bowl: yumzer!- curry mutton: good- spicy fried chicken burger: bland. - sweet potato fries: yumzer!- skinny fries: yumzer!- casava fries: really great!The restaurant itself is in a great location, and has a great vibe and I really liked the decor. The staff (despite the mix up with the reservation) were great. Around 9pm a DJ started playing, which was good fun, but it got way too loud to have a conversation so we went elsewhere for dessert.",

Overall it was alright. The place is a little small and I felt like we were eating ON the people next to us because the tables were so small and crammed together, but whatever...not a huge deal, unless you are huge. Kidding....but yeah, they could spread those tables out to make it comfortable for everyone. I personally don't care for community seating and it somewhat felt like that. Worth a try...",

Unfortunately, what we had actually found was nearly the slowest and worst service we've ever encountered and mediocre drinks in an overly loud setting. The service was so slow that we 1. waited for 20 mins for a drink order and the only way we got it was getting up from our table to find someone. 2. another 20 minutes of waiting for our drinks 3. which our waitress got wrong and 4. after finishing our drinks, waiting another 15 mins, and pulling on our coats/packing up (trying to signal we were leaving) we left our money on the table and flagged down another server to let them know we had paid our bill in full, but the waitress was no where in sight to even give us our bill. Horrible. The extra star in this review is because the building itself is nice enough to sit in and the mixed drink didn't epically suck.",

When we explained that we didn't find the charges to be fair, the manager reprimanded us for eating the incorrect plate and said there was no way she could remove the plate from the bill.

However if you want a lively environment where you can get some good food a vibe and some cocktails then this is a place well worth a visit.Ok the menu may not be as extensive as some places but what it does it does well to recreate the Caribbean vibe in its food. In my opinion some options could use a little more spice on some, but I get it they have to cater for the masses.The service tries to be Caribbean but it's a good thing it's not otherwise you may never eat!! The waiting staff are good not to intrusive and helpful. The drinks menu is a decent one they have a range of cocktails some quite inventive, try the Ting Wray Cocktail, not my favourite but worth a try to experience it!!When I was there they were re-doing their desert menu, which is good as it was limited. What they did have was the caramelised banana cake and ice cream which hits the spot. That is if you have any space left which needs filling in your stomach.I suggest booking a table as it gets busy of an evening time but they certainly do take walk ups. The bar is small so it's not the place to go if you just want a drink and hang out.I will definitely be going back as I like the vibe and the staff during when week are a little more Caribbean then the weekend shift.",
