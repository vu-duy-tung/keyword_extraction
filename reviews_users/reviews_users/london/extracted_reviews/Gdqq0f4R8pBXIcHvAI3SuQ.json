The restaurant part is great too because you find more adventurous food which taste great. Also the menu changes regularly so I won't get bored with it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The wine selection is great. The cost of my dinner was slightly higher than you would pay in a pub, but the food and service is much better so overall I can suggest anyone a visit to try.",

Thursday night I had the foie gras terrine and another starter that was on the special's menu that involved truffle, sausage and spinach - both were fantastic. We split a bottle of house red with it and it was also good. The portions are perfectly sized, but being girls my friend and I enjoy just getting two starters for a good two course meal. Friday night I had the scallops starter which was fabulous, and comes topped with bacon with a wedge of lime, followed by the cod which was cooked to perfection. The white wine I had with it was good, too. I sampled some of my friends risotto she had as a starter which was great too, and the whole table shared a perfectly cooked side of broccoli. Everyone split the creme brulee which looked beautiful and tasted great, too. Gorgeous interior, lovely atmosphere, I'll definitely be back.",

It's down a nice quiet street and set back a little bit from the road so it has plenty of tables outside for smokers. There's a central drinking area with a dining area surrounding it. It's separated enough though to keep a more buzzing atmosphere over drinks.I had this amazing risotto here once. I don't think it's on the menu anymore but it was beautiful; roasted pumpkin, perfectly garlicky, shavings of parmesan, the right amount of oil. I think I keep going back just to see if they've decided to bring it back. Having said that, the rest of the food on the menu is up there, really nice gastropub fare and the Fettucini is really very, very good. Nothing comes cheap round here but it's the sort of place I would take my parents to and I know we'd ALL have a nice time.",

The Abingdon is equally suited to blow-the-budget special occasion meals, girly get-togethers, quick coffee catch-ups, and lingering encounters over fine wines. There are four reasons why this is also my favourite local brunch haunt: 1. Seriously comfortable and varied seating and dining options - including sofas, more formal tables and chairs and cosy hangover-friendly booths, in a stylish setting. 2. Really friendly service. 3. The best eggs benedict in town 4. The best beetroot soup in town",

I got the feeling many customers return again and again as a large proportion were treated as valued friends.

I found the banquette seating sumptuous yet sturdy and appreciated the accent pillows doubling as dividers. My starter was the cavatelli with avocado and chili. Delicate pasta, sheerly dressed with creamy morsels of avocado, four sliced on the bias red chilies on a scant bed of arugula. The chili added the perfect burst of heat. The gentle texture of the pasta and avocado was almost like it sublimated in the mouth. The entree was a perfectly cooked Scottish salmon with a well paired sauce. My date's steak was equally well prepared steak, finished so nicely in their Bertha oven that I wished I could buy one for myself. My main gripe about these dishes was the temperature. None of the food was served hot, just acceptably warm. Now, on to my favorite part - the desserts! I ordered the lemon tart which looked perfect and tasted amazing. It was bright and zingy. A lemon sorbet accompanied the tart along with a stripe of raspberry sauce. All three were very sharp so there wasn't any variety. Still delicious and the best palate cleanser. My date offered a taste of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e he ordered. I'm not a fan of custard desserts but something about it looked enticing. An initially tenuous bite turned into to me polishing of the rest of it. It was that good. So perfectly balanced was the sweetness and vanilla. The texture! It was impossibly airy yet velvety smooth. The caramelized top was flawless with the crunch and chew. I wanted to bathe in it. It was served with a ladyfinger instead of shortbread as listed on the menu. It would probably put me over the edge as I love shortbread. I can't wait to eat here again when I go back to London.",

The English garden risotto, while thick, had an amazing flavor and the rib eye with b\u00e9arnaise was worth every penny. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal, fun feeling that we'd found a true neighborhood gem.",

We also had a lovely muscatel from Spain accompanied by delicious olives. I didn't mean to spend so long here, but it was such an intoxicating environment. The Italian bartender is also completely charming. I highly recommend The Abingdon for an indulgent night out.",

Pleasantly I found an upper scale neighborhood bar with friendly staff and patrons. The bar tenders make good cocktails and the wine list is extensive. I went back two nights in a row and decided to come back for a dinner the third night. The menu items offer a wide selection without being overwhelming. And they're adventurous without being non-sensical. Every single member of the waitstaff was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. If you're looking for dinner, make sure you have a reservation.",

Located in a posh neighbourhood of Chelsea, my husband and I decided to try it out since it is in between our location and his visiting friend. It is easily noticeable that the clients are mostly the upscale members of the society who feels the need to drag along their pet inside the restaurant. One great thing about this place is that their price range is surprisingly within the average range considering where it is located. The 2 course meal we had was \u00a318 per person although they have service charge of 12.5 % is added in your bill in the end. \u00a0All is well though because I was satisfied with the food here. \u00a0Finally, \u00a0I noticed that they have a wide selection of wine to pair with your meal. My verdict: thumbs up.",

I literally cast my eye around the room scanning for an ideal spot, before I knew it I was positioned comfortably on a 4.5 thousand thread count artisan bean bag. A gift from the early 1900s intended to improve Anglo, Prussian relations. I was approached by a handsome waiter draped in his aluminium uniform dungarees, the man had a look of a post orgasm Nigel mansell mending his sons bicycle. I perused the menu which was carved into the table alongside the graffiti 'Kerry smokes blokes for drum baccy' and 'I got a nosh under this table'.

I was visiting London recently and I booked a table here based on great yelp reviews when meeting a friend in the area. I loved everything about this place.The staff were friendly, polite and fun! Offered some great recommendations on menu options too. We started with the scallops and wow, they were delicious. I got the steak pave as my main course with a side of chips and broccoli. It's big enough to share. It was cooked to perfection and was so tasty!! One of the best steaks I've ever had. We finished with ice cream and again it was delicious. \u00a0If I lived in London I would be here all of the time! The Abingdon is by far the best choice for a wonderful dining experience.",
