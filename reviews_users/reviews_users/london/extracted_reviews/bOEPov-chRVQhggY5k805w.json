After we finished that, he kept filling our glasses and poured another bottle of wine for free. Paid $70 for 3 people including drinks and soo much food. Would highly recommend. Very positive experience ^_^",

I'm no foodie like everyone else on Yelp seems to be -all I know is I liked how my food tasted (chicken + goat cheese? yes please!), as did everyone else in the group - and I'd be very happy to order the exact same thing when I go back. The price felt right on target for what I got (actually, felt like a deal by London standards), and the service was quite friendly, especially considering my family was in town so it was a big group of us being loud and picky-ordering Americans. I mentioned that I live in the neighborhood and the waiter (presumably one of the owners/managers) gave me a 10% off coupon - very nice gesture. And at this time of year, the open-air front of the restaurant as a great option.",

We went on a Friday night and the place was quit full and the staff looked very busy but the gentleman who greeted us at the door was happy to give us all the time in the world, he gave us the choice of all the available tables and after we selected a table walked us over and pulled the chair out for my partner. Water was delivered to our table straight away and our drink order was taken. The restaurant was very busy but our waiter didn't mind taking the time to explain a couple of things on the menu and when i didn't know what one of the ingredients where in the dish i wanted to order he went to the kitchen and got a fresh small amount for me to try. The customer services was fantastic, the most expensive meal on the menu was around 15 tp 18 pound but the service we received was like we were spending 70 to 100 pound on a meal. I felt like i was really being looked after and that i was the most important person in the restaurant. The food was amazing and really good value for money. I would recommend this place to anybody and very body. A really big thank you to all the staff at The Blue Legume for giving me a dinning experience that made me feel like i was the only person in the restaurant. FIVE STARS / 10 OUT OF 10 / 100%",

It's one of my favourite places for breakfast or brunch. I haven't been in the evening but I've walked past several times and it looks like it's a great venue for a relaxing dinner.Once you're inside you instantly feel relaxed, there's a lovely atmosphere in The Blue Legume and the staff will quickly get you seated. The decor is interesting, with exposed brickwork in the front section of the restaurant and the ceiling almost completely covered in mirrors. As you head to the back of the restaurant past the delicious looking specials and dessert counters there's a much lighter, white walled section.The portions are generous here, making it great value for money and the food's of a high standard. If there's two of, sharing the Mediterranean breakfast, which consists of grilled Halloumi, spicy sausage, feta, fresh tomato, poached egg, olives and jam with brown toast and the Hash Brown or Cumberland breakfast is a good idea so you get a bit of everything. The fresh combination juices are also excellent and will help set you up for the day.",

    "text": "Went for Sunday brunch. \u00a0Restaurant was packed (usually a good sign), but it only took about 5 minutes for my party of 3 to be seated. \u00a0Very quaint space for breakfast. \u00a0Very 'country kitchen' in decor. \u00a0Bright sun room/atrium in the rear of the restaurant (but seemed a bit toasty back there, and is most likely the case on similarly sunny days). \u00a0Hardwood floors with lots of heavy wooden tables and chairs. \u00a0All very \u00a0nice.Menu features a variety of what appear to be scrumptious breakfast combinations. \u00a0I chose not to go with any of the set vegetarian dishes and, instead, chose to be a pain in the @ss and requested a vegetarian alteration to the HashBrown Breakfast. \u00a0Normally, that breakfast comes with three hash browns, two piece of bacon, scrambled eggs, grilled tomatoes and whole grain toast. \u00a0Our waitress was more than happy to accommodate my request to swap out the bacon for the veggie sausages, so I was all set to go.The hash browns were great...in a greasy-spoon-not-exactly-going-to-eat-them-every-day kind of a way. \u00a0Three triangles of fried potato love that were moving more towards the old school McDonald's hash browns than towards the loose mess of grated potatoes that also qualify as hash browns. The veggies sausages were good, but to be honest, I think that the kitchen may have just gone ahead and crafted vegetarian stuffing into wonderful little sausage-sized links. \u00a0No harm done, though. \u00a0Having been a vegetarian for ages, I've found that, when it comes to alternative/veggie 'meat,' \u00a0after a kitchen has decided to ditch the meat, it's pretty much open season on what they use as a replacement. \u00a0In any event, the veggie sausages were tasty. \u00a0Not the best that I've had, but still enjoyable.Scrambled eggs? \u00a0Perfect. \u00a0I don't care for runny eggs or eggs that are too creamy, and these eggs were perfectly fluffy and retained enough moisture that dryness wasn't an issue.As for the grilled tomatoes? \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0They were grilled tomatoes. \u00a0Nothing brilliant about them. \u00a0They weren't gorgeous, sweet tomatoes shipped in from Italy or anything. \u00a0They were simply what you'd expect of grilled tomatoes and that was fine by me.In terms of the toast, well, I didn't even get around to taking so much as a bite because the rest of the meal was so substantial that I managed to leave a little bit of everything behind, and couldn't be bothered with toast.",

I had the chicken schnitzel and it was nothing to write home about - really tough and kind of greasy like it hadn't been cooked at the right temperature.

    "text": "Loved this place. Thought it was really charming, cozy, and fresh feeling. Nice relaxing atmosphere and is a great place to go for a weekend lunch. If you don't make reservations, you'll have to queue, but from what I saw, the queue never got more than 20-30 minutes during peak Saturday lunch time.Servers are polite and the menu is super fresh.Egg white omelette - comes with spinach and tomato and served with either salad or potatoes. As healthy as you can get, really. I will say there was way more spinach than there were tomatoes, but this comes exactly as described. Also came with a side of broccoli, which I was excited for, but didn't really taste good. It was almost raw and didn't have much of a flavor. The omelette itself was great, though.Organic Honey Biscuit Waffles - with a platter of fancy fruit and drizzled with maple syrup. Now this dish is amazing, but it comes with a huge warning. The dish is called \"waffles,\" but it's about 90% fruit and 10% waffles. You might think I'm kidding. I'm not. Unless you are prepared to eat a plate of fruit, albeit beautifully presented, with a small side of (seemingly packaged and overly sweet) waffles, I would not order this dish. That said, I don't regret that we ordered it simply because of how cool the dish is presented. The fruits are cut up beautifully and there are tons of different kinds: pears, apples, banana, kiwi, watermelon, papaya, grapes, strawberries, oranges, and plums. Unfortunately, none of the fruit was delicious tasting - all a little off or not perfectly sweet. As I mentioned, the honey biscuit waffles were almost certainly not homemade and way too sweet and almost non-existent anyway. Served with sour cream and maple syrup, which I strongly recommend you get on the side instead of as it comes, which is drizzled all over both the waffles (which are already too sweet) and the fruit (fruit doesn't need maple syrup).They also have a ton of homemade desserts: cheesecakes, pies, cakes, brownies, etc... We tried the berry (I think blueberry and yogurt) cake and the chocolate fudge cake. I really like the fact that they are all made in house. The berry cake was great, even better than it looked. The chocolate fudge cake was a very normal chocolate sponge cake (birthday cake) with fudge in the middle and on top. Good, a bit dry, but fine. The fudge frosting was too sweet for my taste, though.Overall, it's a great place. The atmosphere is lovely, people are friendly, and the food is definitely good quality and fresh. There are also tons of healthy options if you're inclined to pick them. I'd go back.",

    "text": "The Blue Legume serves amazing vegetarian and vegan friendly breakfast, lunch, dinner, and basked goods. On top of the very clever name, they also have super good service and a cozy dining room. Two tables are outdoors on the sidewalk for good weather days. Husband and I showed up for a leisurely Saturday morning breakfast and had a great experience. There was no wait for a table at 10 am. We ordered tea, cappuccino, a croque madame, and a stuffed aubergine (counter special). Everything was delicious, fresh, and had wonderful ingredient quality. Portions were good, and we both left quite full and happy. I especially loved the side salads that came with the stuffed aubergine, which I think rotate. The beets with apple were especially memorable, one was rice based, and I want to say one was rocket, and the other perhaps potato. Being that so many of the menu items are vegetarian and vegan, the servers are especially careful and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients. They came by to check on us often and we never had to wait long to flag someone down. The menu also has plenty of gluten free options and is very careful about nut allergies. Price point is fair, especially when considering the quality and portion size you get.",

The menu was extensive and their prix fix menu was great.I ordered their mezze, an array of Mediterranean dips to start. It was good, the dips were super on point and flavorful. Not the most authentic i've had but delicious.Their seafood stew was brimming with mussels, calamari, shrimps all in a delicious broth. I'd eat that again, but couldn't finish all the seafood because of the starter. Got a half bottle of wine and just enjoyed the atmosphere!Maybe on my next travels there I can try their brunch!",

Finally, they were seated and then I was. I asked if I could charge my phone in the back kitchen/bar and was told a stern \"no\" by the hostess. Uhhh ok, this never seems to be an issue in 99% of the restaurants I go to. So dink a star for that. Then, I waited a bit for a waitress (turned out to be the same hostess) to serve me. I ordered the aubergine stuffed with peppers and goat cheese; it comes with three salads. For \u00a37.95 it seems like a great deal... except the aubergine and peppers are flavourless for the most part. Even the goat cheese can't save it. The side salads are also incredibly bland: a bowtie pasta salad, a green beans portion (I hate green beans) and chunky beets and greens (the only good part). I had to wait a while as well for a server to pay attention to me to get the check. Good riddance.",

    "text": "First of all, the Blue Legume serves breakfast til 4pm! This in itself, worthy of 4-stars. \u00a04-stars, 4pm, you get it. If its breafkast-y foods you are after, but the hour has passed...have no fear, they'll whip it up for you. It's an all 'round sweet place. Rustic-esque feel, wood floors, tables and chairs. Bustling on a Friday midday, lots of prams and mums, friends and couples. A nice mix, indicative of the usual Angel crowd. I ordered the \"Honey biscuit waffles with fruit.\" Now, I didn't quite know what to expect, but what I got was surely not in my mind. It was 3 very dense waffles (like Dutch stroopwaffles, if you've had them) with an entire platter of intricately flayed fruit! It was basically a fruit tray with a waffle side dish. Which was actually fine as all the fruit was really nice, and came drizzled with carmel and a bit of yogurt dipping sauce, but the description a bit misleading. No complaints here though, seriously impressive knife skills! Check out the photo. My pal had the french toast and seemed mostly pleased, though it was pretty basic. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs for some protein and they were good. Done and done! Done and dusted! Enough fruit for a whole week in one plate! The service was a bit frenzied, and about 3x they tried to bring us things that weren't for our table. No, as it turns out I didn't order 3 glasses of red wine to go with my waffles, but maybe next time! They have 3 locations: *Stoke Newington*Crouch End*Islington (this one). Also, the fresh juices are great. I had the carrot, ginger and beetroot and it was lovely. I really packed in my fruits and veggies during my stop to Blue Legume, the name of this place doesn't lie. Get ready to load up on the good stuff! *Accepts reservations, even right on Yelp! *Service not included in bill.",

Service was fast and attentive despite the fact this place was, genuinely and with no exaggeration, packed to its limit. I ordered french toast and bacon, my partner opted for pancakes with fruit and yoghurt and our friends went with good old English breakfasts. Everything was tasty, carefully prepared and well presented but I felt the portions were a little mean. I know the emphasis at place like this is quality over quantity but for the price I feel they could have afforded to be just a little more generous. The four of us ended up getting some toast to share and three of us felt a little underfed after we'd finished our meals. It wasn't the biggest deal in the world but it would have been nice to see just a little bit more and in their defence, Breakfast Club or any other popular brunch place have similar portions. I thought that the coffee here was phenomenal and ended up having 3 macchiatos. I feel no shame in admitting that I might have a small problem.",

    "text": "There are no shortage of restaurants on Upper street. With it being quite close to my digs, I do venture that way sometimes. I normally keep it simple and do Nandos (I know, not really a restaurant). Having met a friend at the Cock Tavern on Highbury Corner, a favourite spot of mine for watching sport with friendly Irish folk, we were craving some food so began our walk down Upper Street. We passed The Blue Legume and our attention was caught by the intimate and cosy setting inside. The manager saw us and came out to say hi and give us a flyer offering a glass of wine complimentary with our meal. We were sold. Not necessarily because of the freeness, but because he wasn't pushy and he seemed genuinely welcoming. Inside, we were sat amongst a lot of couples, so I am guessing this is a good spot for dates. The menu is med, meaning that it has Spanish, French, Italian, Greek etc. Sometimes a mash-up of so much can be a little confusing, but all the major food groups are covered, the dishes are not too complicated, its just a good solid fill me up kind of menu. We started with asparagus wrapped in parma ham, grilled garlic prawns and chorizo with potatoes in spicy tomato sauce. For our main courses we had lamb chops with chips, chicken breast stuffed with goats cheese & tomato (note that it is in breadcrumbs) and a side order of steamed spinach. The pricing is right with starters averaging \u00a36 and main courses averaging \u00a311.The Blue Legume is a great option for lunch and dinner. There are also based in Crouch End and Stoke Newington. Enjoy.",

    "text": "As many of you know, brunch is my favourite meal of the day... followed very closely by breakfast. There's something to shovelling delicious food into your mouth at the start of the day (even if the day starts in the afternoon, mind you), that's akin to a celebration of life.So on a swelteringly sunny Saturday morning, I found myself at this particular Blue Legume to meet a friend for breakfast, and the place was absolutely deserted, with the exception of the handful of outdoor seats - those were rammed. Not that I'm complaining. It's been rare this summer for London to get unpleasantly hot, and this was one of those days, so being in the shade was a preferred option anyhow.Cute, cosy ambiance and a menu that features many relatively healthy options. I went for the egg white omelette with some veggies on the side, plus a grapefruit juice (because, unfortunately, their blender was broken... otherwise I'd have gone for the refreshing-sounding apple, celery, and mint juice). I can't say that my meal was particularly extraordinary, but it was a reasonable portion, tasty enough, and other than some minor language barriers in ordering, the staff were proficient.I'd be more than willing to meet up here again for breakfast, but I don't see myself making a strong recommendation for a return trip of my own volition, simply due to there being other options to explore good food in this city. That said, it's a perfectly fine choice to have a bite and to get your day started off on the right foot.",

    "text": "Great place for brunch but not much else. I went there today with some friends. I ordered the Mediterranean breakfast. When I was reading the description, I saw a lot of stuff there: halloumi, feta, poached egg, sausage, salad, olives and toast and I couldn't quite picture in my head how they all work together. Well, let me tell you, this restaurant definitely doesn't hold back. I had a whole platter of food all to myself. The feta cheese was my favorite, very fresh and light. This is your perfect brunch and can last you all the way till dinner time with no problem.",

I had their Mediterranean breakfast, which comes with grilled halloumi, spicy sausage, poached egg, and brown toast. It's absolutely delicious! I would definitely come back to this place again.",

    "text": "I had big plans one day. i was going to get up and get some lunch and some food for the weekend before having to head into Central London to go see a play and have dinner afterwards. Due to heat and being lazy, that just didn't happen, so we needed an alternate plan for lunch. Cue The Blue Legume.It had a few things I was looking for. Breakfast? Check. Near the theatre? Double check. A cool name? Triple check. So I made a booking for lunch and headed that way. It is nice they do bookings for lunch/brunch because a lot of places don't, and I hate not having a booking. So kudos for that.The place is cute, but it's REALLY LOUD. Like super loud. It's hard to hear things, which is unfortunate. But we managed. I ordered the Mediterranean Benedict and my partner ordered the Croque Madame. I got some hash browns on the side (because I love me some hash browns), and we each ordered a juice. Hey did you know they did juice? They have some guy that seems to be dedicated to running juice through their juicer. I ordered carrot, orange and ginger and my partner ordered apple and mint. Both were delicious.The food was great too. My benedict was really tasty, and the hash browns were really heavenly. The Croque Madame was also really well done. Cheesy, hammy, crusty and topped with an egg. Well done! I really enjoyed the food, and we got in and out fairly quickly. If I'm in the area and need a good breakfast, I definitely know where to go.",
