Bowls of heavily salted skinny chips, bowls of yorkshire puddings (essentially tasteless balls of batter with no dipping sauce or any filling) and some turkey on sticks. The best part about the food was when they brought out mini lemon meringue pies. They were nice, but didn't make up for the awful savouries. The staff were surly but very helpful. I know that must seem odd, but they were. They all looked Italian. I asked one of the barmen to top up my ros\u00e9 and he shook his head suggesting they had run out. I looked pleadingly at him and his raised his finger to his lips in a 'let's keep this one under our hats' and made me a special drink with strawberries in it. I have no idea why he did this. I did have the most flamboyant drink at the party though, which was pretty good.",

Armed with a voucher for a free glass of champagne and a slice of quiche, me and a couple of friends marched down, determined to get our free stuff and leave. Five hours later, and four bottles of wine the drunker, we stumbled out not quite sure what had happened but sure that we'd had a good time. The early free stuff was quickly replaced by later expensive stuff, and nobody could quite remember why, apart from the desire for a debauched night. Inside it's like an old colonial bar. Mix and match regency chairs and Parisian benches are matched with chandeliers and marble. The service is excellent, and the wines not too dear (we got a lovely Bordeaux for \u00a322 a bottle). They also do delicious quiches and champagne. That is, if I remember correctly . . .",

    "text": "I went here Friday evening for a friends b'day and after looking at the website was very excited. When we arrived the steps that greeted us were beautiful mosaic'd tiled , it felt special from the moment we walked in. As we were waiting for the rest of the party to arrive we sat in the bar area, they only had a spirit, cocktail and champagne menu, you weren't able to order beers from here but you could in the restaurant area. I ordered a strawberry belini cocktail, it was very pretty and tasted lovely and cost \u00a310. We were then ushered into our seats, the table was set lovely, the decor of this restaurant is gorgeous, it reminds me a bit of my fair lady. You really feel devine and posh in this setting with a pianist playing in the restaurant. The menu came, I thought it was pretty cheap considering the look of this place, the mains cost around the \u00a315 mark and the sides \u00a34. I decided not to have a starter and headed straight for the goats cheese and red onion tart which was served with salad, I thought this was very tasty and for the pudding I went for the Pavalova which was quite possibly the most delicious desert I've ever had! if you come to this restaurant for the pudding itself it would be worth it. I thought the food was ok overall, not amazing just good, \u00a0the pudding was exquisite. Our waiter had a great personality and was very friendly BUT the only downside was (as another rveiew has pointed out) after being handed the desert menu we were left waiting literally for 35min! till they took our order. I even watched as some waiters looked over but just left us to it which wasn't great-thank god the pudding made up for it. I would def come back here though, maybe I'd be a bit more persistant about getting the waiters attention. This is definitly a must if you're in London and fancy a treat after a show or just fancy a touch of elegance, don't be fooled by the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 as it wasn't that expensive! Also I heard Oscar Wilde used to frequent this place and it really does feel like something out of pride and prejudice",

This trouble must have been that all the chefs had gone home leaving someone to open packets and add boiling water as the overall effect was of eating a fairly salty dish that might have been produced by Pot Noodle.

However, a couple of weeks ago we met good friends of ours for a birthday celebration, and had such terrible service we were really disappointed. When we left, my friend paid the bill at the bar, but then on our way out we were chased by the waitress accusing us of trying to leave without paying! We explained that we had a receipt, but she wasn't interested and very loudly informed us in front of all the other customers that she would have to check the till receipts! When she discovered her mistake we got a very abrupt (and quiet in comparison to earlier) apology, but it was a bit late by then! Definitely not impressed at all.",

I'm actually surpised none of my foody friends have mentioned it before, given its origins in Napoleanic times and carrying through as an Oscar Wilde haunt. The modern restoration has achieved both of these eras by keeping the decor simple but french, one can imagine Oscar Wilde sitting in the corner having a cigarette while jotting down some notes w an occasional glance accross the open space room to see what gossip was brewing. As for the food, perhaps a bit too exensive on the normal menu, but was a bargain for us as we stopped by around 4.30pm for an earlier prixe fixe pre theatre dinner for 20 quid. I had a bowl of asparagus soup followed by a duck confeit, both of which were delicious. C had a delicate leek and cheese quiche (gruyere tart) to start with and hamburger to follow. I think the duck confeit won the day with the quiche a second place (the dressing on the side salad with the quiche was also nice). We finished it off with dessert which was an extra fiver per person. Though given all the french bakeries and cafes in the area I would recommend moving on for dessert and coffee (though we both enjoyed our desserts of strawberry pavlova and creme brulle, though they no where not of the same quality as the starters and mains). Sure little things could have been better but this meal was delicious and the french serving staff was friedly and very helpful so four and a half stars from me! Bon appetite.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ delicious food+ attentive service+ fun history+ good for group- crowded and noisy- long wait despite reservation- limited selection in barI came here on a Monday night and it was very busy for the start of the week, although I understand from a friend that the manager is driving a big campaign to lure local diners with special offers. I called in the early afternoon to book for 3 that evening for 8pm with no problem. I arrived at about 7pm for a pre-dinner drink at the bar. It is a champagne bar offering a big selection of champagne and oysters, but I wasn't feeling particular flush on a Monday night for a \u00a350+ bottle of aperitif. Unfortunately their wine selection at the bar was very limited, with 3 white and 3 red only. When 8pm rolled around, we went to the ma\u00eetre d' to get seated but were told that our table was not ready. We returned to the bar for another bottle of wine for the three of us and waited another 15 or so minutes before entering the restaurant. (We later found that there is a much more extensive wine menu for the restaurant within a more diverse price range, which made the bar area seem even less attractive.)The dining area is big but packed with lots of tables and patrons. You don't get a lot of personal space and during a busy night it was very noisy. Consequently it's not a great place for a romantic date, but definitely a good venue to have a French meal with friends. It's particularly fun to read about the restaurant's long history from the menu.The starter I had (cured salmon) was light and whetted my appetite for the meal. I had a medium-rare steak for my main course, which was cooked to perfection. The side order of green vegetable was adequately sized to share between two to three diners, as the main course itself was quite filling. However, the side was disappointing in that it was simply cooked (steamed or broiled) and not seasoned in anyway.To finish the meal, the three of us ordered digestifs and puddings. My friend received his chocolate mousse first before the digestifs arrived, and after 5 minutes the attentive staff noticed that the remaining (hot) desserts have not arrived and apologised profusely, saying that they had to re-make the dessert. The waiter offered us a drink, not realising that we had ordered digestifs which had yet to turn up. Eventually, the digestifs arrived and so did the other tasty desserts, the latter of which were served complementarily because of the long wait. Overall, the food is delicious and the staff very friendly. Although they made a few mistakes along the way, the staff's attentiveness and flexibility made the dining experience a pleasure. The only downside is the proximity to other diners and the noise you get when the dining area is full, but consequently this is a great venue for a group of friends. I would recommend this restaurant highly for groups wishing a fine dining experience, although I would suggest a different bar for pre-dinner drinks unless you specifically want champagne and oysters.",

The wait staff were helpful and attentive, bit at the table and the bar.Overall a very pleasant experience, although a bit on the pricey side.",

But to review Kettners as a bar, great service, fantastic buzz about the place on a Friday evening and stunning decor. An absolutely vast range of champagne to choose from, would definitely go back for a fancy drink for an occasion. Great location 5 minutes from Soho etc. highly recommendable",

Was really worried with a party of 10 that we'd either be neglected or treated with not so friendly service, and I must say that is not the case. \u00a0We were treated with smiles and were waited on efficiently, a lovely experience in that regard.As for the food, it was good, really, but still for me something was missing that leaves me from writing a rave review. \u00a0My fillet au poivre was a too peppery, my scallop appetizer was a bit too small (with bland risotto nero). \u00a0It was all good ingredients just seemed like every dish, even the creme brulee with too much brown sugar on top had one thing too much or too little to keep it from being really good food.Definitely worth it though with a 50% off food deal you can easily find on the internet, it was good, I'm just not 100% sure that with all of the continental/french restuarants in town that I'll be back here again.",

It's gorgeous to go there around Christmas time because the decor is so tastefully done that it feels really decadent. I love the fact that the place has so much history! It's a bit strange to think that it's bolted onto Pizza Express, but it's done very well and their Beef Bourguignon with mash is yum! Not sure it's appropriate to wash it down with champagne, but they have an extensive and enticing wine list!",

Wine list is okay and the service is proactive and polite. However, I was disappointed by the fact that the people were not very elegant, despite the various recommendations on the website and when I booked to respect the dress code. I felt a bit overdressed and the atmosphere looked cheaper than I would have expected.I think it is a much better place for the private parties than for the \"public\" areas.",

Although, I must warn you, drinking with a stick in, and trying not to get the cinnamon stick hitting your nostril is a challenge in itself and so not adorbs. The special shots we ordered a round of, were so unique. That's the thing with kettners, they change their menu every so often that theres always a new drink you'll want to come back and try.But that's also their downfall, the second time I went, the drinks weren't so nice, there was some sort of pulpy alcohol fruit punch and it was just er..pulpy. And they kept forgetting my drink that I ordered, HALF HOUR BEFORE. Girl is getting DRY, people. I know we were a large party but DAMN PEOPLE, first rule of taking any orders down for a big party- PEN AND PAPER so you can keep track.

    "text": "Stepping into Kettner's is a bit like stepping into a bygone era! \u00a0There was a piano player tinkling away on a white grand piano, our waiter was wearing a bow tie, and the powder room (!) has a chandelier. Our waiter was at our table very promptly, and very happy to get us a carafe of tap water (can't stand anywhere that tries to convince me I want bottled water instead!) We also ordered a bottle of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc, which at \u00a326 wasn't cheap but was very tasty. \u00a0We each ordered a starter and main, I had chicken liver pate followed by sea bass on heritage tomatoes. \u00a0The pate was lovely & smooth, although the toast serving was a bit on the measly side for my liking. Seabass was cooked perfectly, fell apart under my fork, not sure tomatoes would have been my first choice but we'd ordered skinny fries and wilted spinach as sides so that more than made up for it. \u00a0The reason for the 4 stars is that we had the deal on tastecard, which made it great value, but I don't know if I'd have felt the same if I'd have paid full price as some of the servings are on the small side. \u00a0But all in all a great evening in a wonderful setting.",

    "text": "We were just in Paris last week whilst I was running the Paris Half Marathon, but I was still feeling a pang for a nice French meal. Besides, I've exhausted my walk-in karma at Brasserie Z\u00e9del, we were wanting to use our TasteCard, and we were calling tonight's dinner, date night. i.e. be a bit splurgy since we don't do it often. Now that the scene is set, here's how the night went. I'd heard a lot about Kettners prior to us reserving a table, and certainly it being on the TasteCard made things a little bit more alluring for the evening, and the menu sure looked like a classic French brasserie. And Yelpers seemed to like it. We were seated in the dining room that has a very interesting decor. It's ornately French, but strangely not as well. Bistro chairs were a little kitchy white, and mismatched, walls are grey somewhat English. It certainly loses a little atmosphere when compared to Brasserie Zedel. Service, however, was amazing. Our waitress was totalling rockin' and she was very knowledgeable about the dishes that they have.Our starters were actually really good. The cheddar and sundried tomato tarte was very well baked and certainly oozed with flavour, and the roasted red pepper soup was absolutely delightful. It was like tomato soup without the sourness of tomato, and a very subtle sweetness to it. We also ordered the pork belly and a coq au vin for mains. The mains I think were the biggest disappointment from the meal. I mean, it was good, and tasty, but I've had much better. The Coq Au Vin was a bit dry and the wine jus very very salty. The same dish at Bar Boloud was innumerably better. The pork belly was actually very well done, and I really appreciated the apple mash. It was a very subtle sweet flavour to an otherwise plain side. I think the pork belly meat itself could have had a much thinner skin to it, the crunch was perfect, but marred only just slightly by the thickness of the skin. All in all, it was a good meal, could have been better food wise, but it was a neat date night. I'd go back again on the tastecard, but if you'd like more value for money without the tastecard, go to Brasserie Zedel, and if you really just want to splurge, go to Bar Boloud. Both places have better atmosphere, and better food otherwise.",

We decided to all (4 of us) order dessert but they all came out at different times. According to our water the chef didn't understand his handwriting or something. But as etiquette demands, we did not start eating until everything was served, and my ice cream for the sticky toffee pudding was already melted. I would still go back no questions, that might have been an off day or a really busy night. The ambiance of the restaurant was amazing and a lovely location. You should definitely try!",

She had already been to Kettner's previously and loved it and we knew that we deserved a little luxury after all our hard work.We went all out and ordered a bottle of champagne then were lucky enough to nab ourselves a table with a sofa and sit back and enjoy the glamour and decadence of our surroundings. I read that Kettner's was a series of Georgian town houses before being converted into a restaurant in the 1860s and Bing Crosby and Oscar Wilde have been amongst its diners over the years.I have yet to eat at Kettner's but what I can comment on is:- The bar - civilised and refined without feeling pretentious.- The staff - helpful and patient, happy to make recommendations.- The cocktails - ok, I only had one, it was the Triple 9 (vodka, strawberries and vanilla with sparkling wine) and I was not a fan I'm afraid, it was far too sweet and too much vanilla to the point where it almost tasted like plastic. It was hard to drink (but I managed... I always do!)- The toilets - plush! There are even some lovely seats to stop for a chat if you fancy (we did!)- The champagne - oh yes, the champagne, it went down well. Perhaps a little too well!All in all I had a fantastic time and I'm sure I will be returning with my Champagne Friday partner in crime for some more suitable squiffy evenings on the bubbles, bubbles, bubbles!",

They do a \u00a310 lunch which was a pretty amazing deal considering you get a main, dessert and coffee. Add a bottle of wine and you can do your business meeting for 4 for about \u00a360.. not too shabby! The express menu had some good American-inspired staples like the half/half combo (soup and sandwich), cobb salad, stead sandwich, steak frites, there's something for everyone really. The service was great, lots of natural light, which was a plus for the sunny day we stopped in. Looks like there's some separate bar bits and they are meant to do wine/spirit tastings upstairs. I'll be popping back in for sure!",

    "text": "I recently came here as part of London Cocktail Week, and have to say that coming to Kettner's was like stepping back in time...for two reasons.The first reason was that this place is seriously glamorous -- it has a similar luxurious feel of the Garden Court at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco,or the tea room at Claridge's here in London. I wish I could comment more on the actual detailing of the decor at Kettner's, but I'm afraid London Cocktail Week did a bit of a number on me and I can't remember it all too well. Suffice to say, though, that I half expected Bing Crosby to waltz through the doors in a tux at any moment.However, what I do remember about the decor brings me to my second reason why Kettner's was a step back in time: some of the chairs in the back parlour-esque area are ridiculously short and small. They happen to be big enough for an adult, but just barely. It's a very cute effect, but not great if you're particularly tall (which I'm not). I felt slightly like I was back in grade school again, sitting nearly at eye level with the table in front of me -- but instead of crayons, this table was covered in cocktails.Which brings me to my final point: Kettner's make lovely cocktails. We started off with the London Cocktail Week special (a bellini of sorts with an absinthe-soaked sugar cube and a curiously placed slice of fennel), but then moved on to their standards, which were the definite highlight. All of them were very well-crafted and delicious. The one that particularly stood out was the plum and mint julep, but be warned: this drink is seriously boozy!",

I was in London on business and my company held a two-day meeting there, so I became very familiar with the place. Along with the restaurant and bar downstairs they have banquet and event rooms upstairs. The room we had our meeting room was very nice, open and had a lot of light coming through the numerous windows. They provided coffee, tea, and cookies as well as a lunch buffet of traditional English food. I thoroughly enjoyed the \u00a0atmosphere and the food along with the beverages served during the day and at night. We also had a \u00a03 course dinner there after our meeting. The food was amazing, i highly recommend this place for events or for just a night out. Enjoy!",

It's also said that King Edward VII courted his mistress, actress Lillie Langtry here. There's a beautiful piano bar and champagne bar when you first enter kettner's. It's a french menu that uses locally sourced ingredients for the dishes. There's not much to say about this place besides the fact that it's absolutely amazing and beautiful. What makes your stay even that much better, is the customer service and the willingness of the staff to go above and beyond for their customers. It was my first time here and it definitely won't be my last. Although I'm not quite sure if a Soho House membership is required, I encourage anyone to stay here. It's in the heart of the cutest town in London, with AMAZING restaurants all around. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!!!",

Things started off fine at the bar, as this is where you wait until the dining area opens for dinner. Now let's get to the good part \u00a0once seated we decided on the lobster Mac and cheese and the salmon for starters - since we were starving we put in our starters to look over the menu for our main course - well apparently this is not customary because the server looked at us like we were crazy and then confused me as I could not understand what he was saying- now yes we are in a different country but I have had better conversations with servers in countries where ENGLISH is not the spoken language. It didn't get easier from there, they brought another tables meal to our table and then left and came back before taking the meal to the correct table, ewwwww why would not at least pretend and take the food to the back before giving it to its rightful recipients Our food came and for a \u00a330 steak with \u00a32.50 red wine sauce, I was absolutely underwhelmed- I've had better cuts of steak at less than half the price - my biggest gripe with this restaurant is the language barrier, I mean the menu is in English and I'm reading it to you but you don't understand what I'm saying - I personally won't visit again, the lobster Mac and cheese was the only thing I enjoyed",

    "text": "So I finally got the chance to EAT at Kettner's instead of just showing up mid-day on a Saturday for drinking. And I kind of wish I hadn't, because it has kind of soured my whole Kettner's experience. (Although I'd probably still come back for a drink or two).We opted to have our book group meeting here because we were reading Agatha Christie and apparently she used to go there quite a bit. We arrived about five minutes before our booking. We were told we couldn't be seated yet, but we could wait in the bar. WHICH WAS COMPLETELY OVERFLOWING WITH PEOPLE. It was loud and awkward. Plus I had a bit of a throat thing, so it was hard for me to talk loudly (Cue laughing from everyone who knows me). Fine it was five minutes. So we waited and got seated promptly at 7:00. It wasn't as if the restaurant was anywhere close to full at this point. I still don't know what the five minutes was about. Since I was having a throat/voice thing, I asked if they could make a Hot Toddy. \"No.\" Um, Okay... That's a bit brusque. So we look at the drinks. There was the monthly drink which looked as if it could be a warm cocktail. \"Is the cocktail warm?\" \"No.\" Double brusque.So we ordered. I ended up getting lukewarm tea and a shot of whiskey to make my own version-ish of a hot toddy. It wasn't very hot. And the waiter would disappear for ages. It was really strange. I only had one because it's not as if the waiter ever returned to our table for anything except to try to sell us dessert.I had the creamy cauliflower soup (well we all did), and it was freaking amazing. I was kind of shocked how good it was. For the main, I had venison with pear, spinach and a celeriac puree. It was also really tasty, but I ate it in like two minutes because it was the smallest main course I've had in my life (and it definitely wasn't cheap). Other people's looked much bigger. It was kind of strange. I mean it was two tiny slices of venison. Really well cooked and tasty venison, but tiny.We decided not to go for dessert. Although the steamed ginger sponge looked great. Mostly because it was SO LOUD in there none of us could hear each other when we were talking about the book. It was off-puttingly loud. Plus since I could barely talk, it didn't help. Normally I could talk over people like that, but not last night. They also really seemed to want to get people in and out. Our starters arrived quite quickly after ordering (even though they kept us sitting there for ages before we could order).So the only thing that saves Kettner's (the restaurant) from getting one star (because the service really pissed me off), is the delicious food. It's really delicious. Like annoyingly delicious given the service and atmosphere.",

    "text": "Ooh these guys made me feel special! I booked one of their beauitiful private dining rooms for a birthday dinner with my closest friends. I think it was a fairly quiet night for them being a Sunday, but hey that's the date I was born and may have been part of the reason everything ran so smoothly.I booked the Cabinet Particulier which is at the top of the house and says it can take up to 18 peeps, but I had 16 and that was about right - you need a bit of space at either end to get around the large oval table that fills the whole room. It was laid out beautifully (crackers and all) and we had a dedicated waiter all night who was very diligent, from handing out Nutty Santa welcome cocktails at the start to telling me I'd run over time with too much chatting at the end woops...It was a very relaxed evening though and we all chose from the xmas menu on the night which had 3 or 4 options per course. It was spendy at \u00a349.95 a head but delicious food so I think everyone was happy to treat themselves with it. I like pretty much anything involving goat's cheese but my starter was actually really nicely done. The portion sizes were also generous - I went for the traditional turkey and trimmings main and couldn't finish it. I was also concerned that the veggies got good value for money and it looked/sounded like they did, as did the vegan for whom I'd had to give them advance notice and they cooked up a giant cous cous stuffed red pepper for main!I covered the drinks bill for everyone which was also reasonable - there is an extensive wine list covering all budgets and for parties they'll usually ask you to choose a white and red option in advance. They don't ask for a hire charge either which is nice, just a minimum spend that I knew I would meet once you add up everyone's food and a cocktail each. Having done a lot of research on private dining rooms in London to find this place, this was the usual sticking point!Would defo recommend for a special occasion - you have complete control over the dress code and can set your own tone with the music too if you like. They have rooms for everything from 10 people up to wedding reception sized. It was such a nice treat to have a space to ourselves, and just made it feel extra special :)",

The other day, a friend called to say they have introduced a lunchtime 'Express' menu with a price of \u00a39.95 for a main and coffee. \u00a0We decided that we would try it out and have a late lunch.The interior is just as impressive as I remembered. \u00a0I always wondered why such a classy looking place felt so comfortable. \u00a0I don't know why this is, but I still felt at ease as I ever did. The staff on our arrival were very attentive and welcoming.My friend chose the Fish and Chips; I went for the Caesar Salad. We chatted for a few minutes, when the Ma\u00eetre d, came to our table. He apologised for the delay, as he said this was a new menu, and they were having teething problems with the order system. We said it was no problem, but he produced two glasses of complimentary Laurent Perrier champagne for us. We were impressed as we did not feel we were waiting too long.The portions were great, and not scaled down as I expected them to be for the price. The presentation also made the food seem appealing ( I had problems trying to finish my meal as it was such a large portion).Whilst we were eating our main, the Ma\u00eetre d approached us again and apologised once more for the delay. \u00a0He then offered us a free desert. I went for a chocolate tart with pear sorbet; my friend went for the cr\u00e8me brulee. I'm not usually a desert person, but it was delicious.For a budget lunch I could not have faulted this experience. The level of food was only surpassed by the service. We will definitely return.The lunchtime 'Express' menu is 12-3pm. This is the current selection of mains: \u00a0Grilled 6oz Rump Steak, Roast Tomato Corn-Fed Chicken Caesar Salad Fish & Chips, Crushed Peas, Tartar SaucePan Fried Loch Duart Salmon, Spiced Warm Potato Salad Butternut Squash Risotto, Mascarpone, Toasted Almond (v)Warm Farfalle & Grilled Vegetables Salad, Pesto Dressing (v)",

One person in our party had an avocado salad, which contained a 2 cm piece of avocado. When she told the waiter that there was no avocado, he came back and pointed at the tiny piece of avocado. It was like a sketch from a comedy show. I had a salmon dish, which I thought was very well done. The fish was moist and not over cooked. Kudos. The chocolate pot dessert was chalky and overwhelmingly sweet to the point it tasted more like sugar than chocolate. Overall, it was an okay meal and worth trying but I would probably not return.",

A lovely genteel, old fashioned, English restaurant - albeit with a great bar too. Cocktails kicked us off and they were fab - good prices too if you happen to be there at happy hour. Service was a little slow given it was so quiet however we were chatting so much that was not an issue. Food - beef bourguignon was amazing. Real melt in the mouth beef and lovely mash. If anything I would have liked a slightly larger portion or perhaps a serving of veg. Sorbet and coffee to finish. And all in all (for London anyway) a pretty reasonable priced bill. I will definitely be back here!",

It's a great restaurant with a magically period building and an illustrious history. The three course party menu went down a treat. Everyone particularly loved the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert - it may have been a British novelty for the guests - but having eaten many of them in my life time I can say it was fantastic. The peanut butter ice cream was lush. If you're looking for a red wine definitely go for the Chilean Carmen\u00e8re. It's quite incredible. What would have got them the 5 stars? The only let down was that our water wasn't consistently topped up and we had to keep on getting the attention of the waiters to top up the wine. Aside from that the service was brilliant and the evening was a success. I'm definitely going to head back there.",

There r few places in London which can concoct these feelings of the past in such measures. The food is secondary when u have this type of ambience. Soup was fresh and the beef borboignone was a little to sweet and dry for me. However this is a place were u can only have fun.

Neither time can I say I was disappointed, nor bowled over.I found the drinks to be pleasant enough, but slightly pricey. Hardly standout.The afternoon tea was better. I went with a large group of people for a birthday party. Service was quick, friendly and polite. The sandwiches were varied and tasty, the jam and clotted cream good quality, and the cakes imaginative and decadent. The quantity was satisfying too.One thing I am definitely not a fan of is the white interior. I appreciate they're going for elegance, but it just leaves me cold. Horses for courses I guess.",

However, first appearances turned out to be deceptive - the service, drinks and atmosphere just does not match up to the price you're paying (\u00a314 for a margherita).I chose a seasonal cocktail called Cherry Christmas, which apparently consisted of Disaronno, cherry brandy and Prosecco... Unfortunately these tastes didn't come through at all. Kettner's offers table service, but even when we had ordered our drinks it took another 30 mins before they arrived, meaning we had been waiting for over 45 mins with no drinks at all. To clarify, it was not even particularly busy.As a final disappointment, the bathrooms look beautiful at first sight, but every cubicle was dirty and untidy.... Not what you would expect from a place trying to market itself as high-end. I don't plan to return",

Beautiful building, beautiful rooms and just generally beautiful place (even the bathrooms).We started off at the bar and had their champagne of the month, an initiative I always appreciate, as it encourages you to try unusual champagnes, and not stick to the usual Bollinger. Then we were seated and the service is really good, but I was let down by the food massively.I had the chicken liver parfait which was nice but not amazing, but my main was the real let down. I had the black ink linguine with seabass and they were two different temperatures, everything was bland and it just didn't go.My friends also commented that their food was bland so it was a real shame - also, I hate having to add my own condiments so that particularly annoyed me.Best part was the icecream: buttermilk and cinnamon. Now that was amazing. But it's ice cream. Do I want the most memorable part of my meal out to be the icecream?I'll probably go again and order something else - anyone can have a bad day. I'll keep you posted!",

    "text": "Imagine a hotel bar and the SDF-3 had a child. That's pretty much what Kettner's is and you have my heartfelt apologies for dragging out such an obscure reference on a Monday. But I'm going to let it stand because I've got a case of the Mondays and I've used up my week's allotment of coffee breaks already.Kettner's was the last stop on our CMYE pub crawl for Yelp drinks and to be honest we didn't really need another one. But hey, they were half price so why not? There is a restaurant I hear is quite good, but this is just about the bar.The bar is spacious, elegant, refined, and at midnight on a Thursday very much empty. There were just three other people in the room with us although the private rooms upstairs did seem to contain a few more. The menu is adequate but by no means elaborate and they seem to focus on those pricier champagne cocktails that are full of black tie style but lacking in imagination, depth, and alcohol. This may be a bit unfair generalisation as the cocktails at Zenna we had just before were fantastic in every sense of the word but such is life.The waitstaff were friendly and service was very quick (which may be due to the high service to drinker ratio which was about 1:1 so no promises if it's busy). The seats were comfortable and I can easily see this as a good place to relax and sip a drink while catching up with a friend. The location is convenient to pretty much everything in the Soho area so that's a win too. In fact, it's pretty close to Mooli's if you fancy a late night Indian not a [insert suitable expletive here] burrito (which we did).Overall, there was little to make it memorable other than the most excellent company of Ian P (and his lovely missus), Peter S and Tisha B. But when you have them, what more do you really need?",

Now, usually I base my ratings almost entirely on the food, but this is a place built on atmosphere and service, and it seemed only fair to take that into account. Both were impeccable. We were sat at a corner table in the back room and yet still felt very well looked after. A person at another table sent a dish back (the dessert special; more on the food momentarily) and they handled it very quietly, with no questions asked. Five star service; five star atmosphere - a beautiful restaurant. We had three courses, which is a rarity for me, but it was a special occasion. Started with half a dozen oysters (which, at \u00a313.50, isn't terribly overpriced), which ranged in size from medium to massive, and tasted fresh and delicious. Absolutely no shell or grit in there, so kudos to the shucker. A bit of a fail on the mains - my partner's steak was cooked nicely, but had no sear; my duck confit was cooked too long and the skin went beyond crispy to impenetrable leather. But the actual meat was only slightly dryer than I'd expect. It was good, but not great. For dessert, he got a creme brulee and I got a blackberry/apple crumble with custard. Both were delicious. Overall, this is a great place in terms of atmosphere. And the prices were fairly standard - \u00a316.50 for my duck; about \u00a330 for the steak. The main course was just below my expectations for a truly spectacular meal, but I don't think it would prevent me from returning. I just might try the coq au vin (it looked delicious) instead.",
