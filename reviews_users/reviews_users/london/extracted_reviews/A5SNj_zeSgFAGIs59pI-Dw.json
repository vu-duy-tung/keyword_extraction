Rare. b\u00e9arnaise sauceRating 4/5 - cooked well and tasted good. The wine: Shiraz, Stonedale, South Africa - very nice and good value at around \u00a317 a bottle.The service: Friendly but had to search around for the waiting staff to get more veg, chips and wine.Overall 4/5 - Simple and fast.

There was much to recommend the meal; the house Shiraz was a perfectly balanced South African with a good spice and berry kick, the (free and unadvertised) house salad was a welcome addition (albeit served with an incongruous grated cheddar) and the service was warm and friendly.Sadly though, the chips seemed very much pre-prepared and the disc of foie served (for a \u00a33 supplement) alongside came fridge cold. Worse still, the steak was flavourless. Well marbled and well prepared, a good Cote de Boeuf should be really packing, but this one packed up early and didn't give us anything.",

We were actually wanting them to ask, because we were that disappointed with the steak that we had some ammunition.The Cote de Beouf was big and juicy but just,.. well... tasteless. It was eating meat for eating meat's sake.The sides, except for the mushrooms, were limp and overcooked, including the chips.The saving grace was the relatively cheap Portuguese wine we opted for (no recommendations given) - it was really rather good.Won't be coming back here. I'd be interested to see, perhaps at the expense of someone else, if the other B&B restaurants are better in comparison. I suspect being in a touristy and popular gathering spot like Borough Market has bred a sense of complacency. They're going to be busy no matter what.Shame.",

Hardly lifechanging, but when last can you say you had a really good version of it?The burgers arrived a little late, but with earnest apologies from our super cheery waitress; well done for Ms P and cremated for me, in slightly over toasted buns, with a side order of chunky chips and three sauce options. The burgers were top notch, which was lucky as the fries were disappointingly tasteless and \u00a0way overcooked. Fortunately, our dessert made up for things. A a chocolate brownie \u00a0always does !! \u00a0 That \u00a0gooey square of chocolate heaven, decorated with raspberries and a side scoop of ice cream was lush and big enough for both of us to share. I'd never been to Blue and Black before, but I would recommend it . \u00a0Just one bug bear, in the push to seat as many customers as possible, the reality of diners actually being able to get in and out of the tables was definitely forgotten about. \u00a0Something the restaurant manager needs to address sharpish methinks !",

Perfect steak should be the foundation for success, not the limit of their ambitions. Surrounding the star of the show with a load of mediocre crap worked well enough for Maggie Thatcher but it didn't do much for my dinner. Plus marks for friendly, informed and attentive service, and more for stocking Black Sheep ale and a wine list that was varied without being overwhelmingly long.I'd go back as it's a fun place and the steak is genuinely awesome.

We also had a few starters, which were mediocre and definitely over priced at six pounds each, because they were just too small, something you don't tend to think about American restaurants, usually you struggle to finish. But overall, I think it was good value for money, my steak was around \u00a320 and the prawns cost about \u00a315 if I recall correctly.You cant miss this place, there is a black bull outside, almost accurate in size, with steak printed across it. It is really nice inside, it has separate rooms and some brick work with nice lighting, is great. The service is top notch, I asked for a bottle of recommendation on a bottle of wine and it went perfectly with my steak, the bottle cost \u00a317,and went down like a treat, I had to have the whole bottle too as the girlfriend wasn't feeling up for it, no complaints there!

I reluctantly walked in through the doors to this place at thought, hey at least its for free. Now, I had the sirloin this time as hopefully they can't make such a mess of it as they did with the rib-eye last time. I asked for medium done, and hey, when it arrived it was medium as you expect (not the American way where 'medium' means 'well done'). Got mushroom and spinach on the side.The only complain (well it has to be something, right!) is that the staff, even that they were a sweet and really good looking bunch of girls both had problems with the language and also didn't know what the items on the menu contained or was any good. So when asking if the mushrooms had garlic, the answer was \"don't know\" and \"do you like garlic with your mushrooms\"... there were a couple of more of these from the second girl and you quickly realised that they have never even tried any of the food on the menu...Though, after last experience, well, this place is actually ok but perhaps before I give to too much credit, I might want to go a 3rd time and see if the first one was a one off or if the second one is one... \u00a0 Anyway, nice meat well cooked (not as last time) and a bit poor knowledge of the staff.",

In desperate need of some red meat, I rounded up my cowpokes and herded on down to Borough Market and into Black & Blue. Once the waitress mozied on over and took our orders, within a very short time, I had myself a beer and a lovely piece of juicy, bloody ribeye steak in front of me. After taking in the aroma of my sizzling piece of meat, I dug in. Let me tell ya'll, it was darn tooting tasty! Maybe not the best this old longhorn has ever tasted, but it was definitely worth coming back to.One of my ranch hands actually ordered the Black & Blue steak. For all you city slickers who don't know what that is, it is when they flash fry the steak so it is cooked thoroughly on the outside and somewhere between raw and tar-tar on the inside. Interesting side note: They have three or four different sauces for the steaks; gravy, garlic & butter and Bearnaise. Oddly, the gravy was much better tasting, although I did not dare put it on my steak. That would be a big no-no for this Cowboy. Giddy up!",

The wine isn't cheap, they serve it in large glasses without asking which is a really pet hate. But, it meant we didn't have to order drinks over dinner. My rose wine however, wasn't good. In fact, we both realised that it tasted of nothing. I've never had wine that tastes of nothing before. But, I asked if I could change it for a different glass, not only were they happy to give me a more expensive glass, they agreed it wasn't a great wine (which begs the question why is it still on the menu?) Our table was ready pretty quickly, and whilst starters were average (the chicken wings really aren't worth the \u00a36) it was time for steak. Mine was perfectly rare and tasted really great actually. I'm powerless before a rib-eye and it was a good choice. Pepper sauce came with, which is a nice touch. So was the salad on the side. Although why every single dish we ordered came with cress I'm not sure. Cress does not go with everything. We didn't stick around for dessert as nothing grabbed our attention (an \u00a38 cheeseboard with three uninspiring cheeses on it? sort it out B&B) so instead we decided to find another pub before last orders. Of course then we had to wait while they faffed around not taking our money. Hate it when restaurants do that. This chain could be brilliant, but it falls short for me. The steak is good, and the waitresses are lovely, but the rest just isn't up to scratch. When your dinner is around \u00a330 a head with a glass of wine, I expect more.",

    "text": "We went here on a bank holiday Monday after discovering most places in the area were closed. We live nearby and always thought that it looked like a good restaurant. It was very quiet when we arrived, however so was the rest of the area, anyone sensible had left London for the weekend! The decor is modern but a big area and seems a little stale. There was no background music so it felt very quiet. Steak is the main choice on the menu, I had a fillet and my partner a T-Bone. It was ok, but not up to the standards of the cost. The price is not far off the Gaucho and the Gaucho quality is much higher. You could only have chips with the steak (no option of baked potatoe or mashed potatoe for example) and the chips were like oven chips. There was also a lack of side order options such as veg. Overall, not impressed, an ok steak restaurant but should be priced a lot lower given the quality. Helen",

    "text": "Pottering around the spangly new Bankside commercial development in search of vittles, it quickly became clear that as Tsuru Sushi was closed and neither Leon, nor any of the local gastro-pub-ified glass boxes (nor any of the menus displayed therein) exhibited the necessary gravitas for a Saturday night's gastronomics, we'd have to potter straight back to Borough Market in search of something more substantial - if ideally less financially crippling on this occasion than the nearby Brindisa. Eschewing oysters and friends, given the neighbourhood (and my obsession with steaks), we settled swiftly upon Black & Blue, a Bankside-standard chrome-and-glass enclosure of brick caverns and bright lights promising decent cuts of beef with less-than stellar price tags. Though the welcome was cordial, I was a bit put off by our placement right in the corner of the restaurant, even though I expressed a clear preference for other obviously free tables in the centre of the room. The hostess explained that they liked to keep those free for pushing together in case larger groups came in, and though I didn't particularly like it, it seemed reasonable from their point of view, so I wearily submitted. As the menu was standard steakhouse fayre, I summarily ignored all but the \"steaks\" section and, foregoing the indulgence of a c\u00f4te du boeuf all to myself on the grounds of common decency, plumped happily for the ribeye. By contrast somewhat more mysterious than its carnivorous counterpart, the wine list only stated years for a couple of its members, notably 2001 vintages with big numbers next to the pound signs. The waitress provided years for a select few we asked about, and one particular '2005' response made the associated St. Emilion Grand Cru an inevitable - and, as it turned out, impeccable - choice. Smooth, round and yet grand, with distinct blackcurrant overtones. Winner. Onto the food, from the outer edge in. The walnut and cheese side salad was definitely dressed, despite my asking twice for it to be naked, but it wasn't an overpowering vestment, so no particular fuss was needed. Good chips, crisp and light; good, if unexpectedly fiery, pepper sauce, light on the cream and heavy on the spice. Unusually, perhaps in an access of intuition, I'd asked for the ribeye rare rather than blue, and given the graininess of the bone-side meat, this was an inspired choice. The extremely solid steak knife felt a little like it was tearing rather than cutting, and the chewing consistency seemed a tad bitty. Not the most mature piece of beef I've had; there was certainly flavour there, but it was somewhat overpowered by the peppercorns, and the overall impression of the course was, well, \"that was fine\". Which is a bit of a shame for a steakhouse. Onto the home straight and a cheese selection (stilton, cheddar, white Lancashire) sat very well indeed with a berry jam and cress, and also with a perfectly reasonable tawny port whose provenance I forget entirely, but which was the only port on the list. To conclude. Definitely a steakhouse, and part of (an admittedly small) chain; not super-cheap, but not outrageous (\u00a356 a head including a \u00a336 bottle of red); reasonable food, and friendly service. In fact the service is perhaps one of the main points to note here; the management clearly have a policy of employing only the most smiley, co-operative and attractive staff possible, lending a sufficiently smooth air that in conjunction with an extremely good Grand Cru, even customarily critical - not to say curmudgeonly - customers such as myself leave feeling well served. We arrived at around 7.30 on a Saturday night, and though the service felt attentive and timely, we were also left enough to our own devices that with only 2 courses we still pottered off at just gone 10, and at no point felt rushed. On reflection the food wasn't quite as good as it seemed in the warm after-glow of such careful handling - hence the three-star rating - but it was a decent meal and a good evening. I'd go there again, if not expecting to be blown away.",

Everybody knows that a lot of travelling make people like me hungry, and so i decided to try this place which had been in my radar for some time.But it wasn't easy getting there, lost as i was in the maze of streets around Vinopolis. I called them up and they were very patient in giving me precise directions from the imprecise location that i provided them. One extra star for that :)Black and Blue seems to be a bit out of place in the area where its located ... with a modern decor (they have a glass lift in the interior) in an area of old buildings. But all these things remained far from my mind as i went in and ordered. They don't leave anything to your imagination regarding what food they specialize in ... you see pictures of cows all around. So i have a feeling that they might not be very popular among veggies.I ordered my steak well-done, with bearnaise sauce (which was yummy). They served it with a side of chips and salad which was very thoughtfully brought to me in a separate bowl, so that i could ignore it completely and concentrate on the meat ;)The steak was good ... and at \u00a318 for a 10 ounce piece, probably slightly cheaper than the average. This makes it a very good value-for-money place if you are craving for your pound of flesh.",

We were pleasantly surprised. The space was comfortable and airy, the service was good. The menu was simple and did not have too many choices. But the filet, rack of lamb, king prawns and chicken wings were all well cooked and tasty. The meats were flavorful and perfectly cooked to our specifications. The Malbec by the glass was quite good.

The cut of meat was rather small, but I will say that at least they were cooked to order (medium and medium-rare), which one would expect from a proper steakhouse. I had the chicken with bacon, mozzarella, and pesto. The chicken was an incredibly thin and meager portion, with the bacon rather dry. The mozz was tasty but there just wasn't enough of it. The side salad was just depressingly portioned.For dessert, we shared the chocolate fondant, chocolate brownie, and the pecan pie. The fondant was small (a theme it seems at Black & Blue) but delicious, the brownie was room temperature and a bit hard and not-at-all appetizing after one bite, and the pecan pie was passable at best. Each came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.All in all, if you come only for wine and steak, you're probably fine, but don't expect much more. If you're starving on a Sunday night, well you have very few other choices. Otherwise, nothing is likely to bring me back.",

Yes indeed.Went here after walking through the rain to find somewhere that wasn't packed to the rafters on a Sunday evening. Every pub was brimming with people, and I was really pleased to remember this gem tucked behind Borough Market. The wine list has a lot of good options, and they do have helpful recommendations for pairings. I had a nice glass of Merlot to go with my sirloin steak. It was a really nice wine for the price.The steak itself was excellent. Perfectly cooked to medium rare and tender, with a lovely peppercorn sauce. They're very flexible about allowing you to choose your potato (I didn't fancy fries, so swapped for new potatoes, which were also tender and flavourful), which is a huge bonus. The side salad had a great mix of crisp, flavourful greens (more than your usual iceberg and rocket!) with a tangy dressing. My husband said his burger was also fantastic - cooked perfectly to a medium, and delicious. If you'd like tasty meat cooked perfectly to order in an accessible (oh yeah, there's a lift to the toilets and the entrance is wheelchair accessible) and unpretentious steakhouse - this is your best bet. Craft ales, good wines, great steaks, and at very reasonable prices. We paid around \u00a360 for two meals, a glass of wine, and two London Meantime ales.",

Large monotone portraits hang on the walls, some quite moody looking, and on the upper level there was a cow statue. The booths were separates by panes of glass, much to the bemusement of my party and the diners to the side of us. At best it felt like we were dining with them, at worst felt like we were on prison visitation. Honestly though, the setting was generally alright, just a bit contemporary for my tastes.You go here for the food though. For starters half the party had chicken wings (which were more like tiny drumsticks but did taste very good), the rest of the party had butterfly prawns in breadcrumbs which were a bit bland but had perfect breadcrumb coating.The steaks were far superior to the starter. Steaks always come with fries and choice of sauce. I chose the fillet steak with peppercorn. It was perfectly cooked; juicy on the inside but with the sweet charred outside. Satisfied grunts from around the table confirmed everybody else was enjoying their food just as much, with rave reviews of the T-bone steak and also the steak with Thai green curry.The service was especially good here. We had a lovely waitress who ensured we had enough to drink and laughed out bad jokes from the table.It's not a cheap night out. With other steak restaurants like Flat Iron serving steak for \u00a310, I struggle to see value in a place whose steaks start at \u00a323. It's easy to spend \u00a350pp and for that you can get a lot more in London. It's for this reason I don't mark it higher.",

My delicious steak was cooked perfectly (medium) and the peppercorn butter melted slowly onto the meat creating this beautiful glaze.To drink, I had 2 glasses of the house white and we were then pleasantly surprised by a glass of champagne each on the house!Overall we paid about \u00a320 each for a 2 course lunch and drinks- worth every penny and I would definitely stop in here for lunch again!",

    "text": "I walked in with my SO last Tuesday evening around 6:30pm and we were ushered towards one of a number of small tables crammed into spaces clearly designed to be spaces. \u00a0The interior itself has a modern airy and actually rather cool feel marred only by some awful prints on the walls and the insertion of the tiny tables.I ordered a medium-rare ribeye. \u00a0It arrived perfectly cooked, it was just an awful piece of meat. \u00a0Flat, stringy, gristly, just depressing. For a similar experience soak a small facecloth in bovril, stuff it into a condom, hit it with a hammer and serve with fries and lambs lettuce. \u00a0In what is a part of London full of restaurants able to hand cut, twice and thrice fry your fries it is literally gobsmacking to find a restaurant serving what taste like barely once cooked economy supermarket frozen chips. The chips served in the kebab shop arch by London Bridge station are leagues ahead. \u00a0It came with a green salad, that at least spiritually was entirely beige. \u00a0The Albari\u00f1o was acceptable, but couldn't mask what really was a thoroughly depressing gastronomic experience.A good desert can often save a dining event, \u00a0I just couldn't be bothered to order one. \u00a0We left about \u00a380 lighter, hungry and in search of cake.",
