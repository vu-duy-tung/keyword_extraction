Tried the Shanghai steamed dumplings, pork and prawn dumpling (a favourite), clear shrimp dumpling, quail egg croquette puff (pretty special), baked roasted pork buns (THE favourite), sesame buttered smoked chicken (was really nice but probably wouldn't order again because the other stuff was even better), pot sticker, mushroom, pork and truffle dumpling, taro cake (really good), wonton with garlic, chilli oil and crispy bean curd, scallop puff with XO sauce (really good), sweet and sour rib and fried cheese. So we kind of worked our way through the menu. We are definitely planning to return and have the Peking duck feast, I bet it's sensational!",

    "text": "Update: 15.02.2012 A rather less good experience the other night: I went with a friend and her daughter. They didn't want rice with the meal, but instead ordered another main dish, and we were in a hurry. The waitress informed us rather gracelessly that we had to order at least \u00a310 of food per head after 19:00. We were unaware of this (we didn't see it on the menu) and ordered some spring rolls as well. The restaurant was almost empty, so we weren't denying anyone else a table. The food was absolutely fine, but when we came to pay the bill came to nearly \u00a340 anyway, so we need not have ordered the spring rolls. It included 12.5% service charge but the credit card machine asked me if I wanted to add a tip, which is a practice I find really unpleasant; anyone not paying attention could easily pay the service charge twice. A real pity, as I liked the place before, so it has dropped a couple of stars.-Five minutes' walk from Victoria station, Kym's is a cut above your average Chinese restaurant and, although a little more expensive, in my view is well worth it. The menu is wide-ranging, featuring mainly Cantonese and Pekinese cuisine. An added bonus is the extensive vegetarian menu: this includes 'vegetarian meat' dishes, where vegetable ingredients are used to mimic the taste and textures of meat dishes. These include sweet and sour vegetarian chicken, sizzling vegetarian beef and vegetarian prawns! More traditional vegetarian dishes are available if that seems a little like missing the point. The wine list is also extensive for a Chinese restaurant, with good house wines (French Vin de Pays) from \u00a312.50, ranging up to \u00a350 a bottle if you are feeling flush. Expect a two-course meal with wine, coffee and service to cost about \u00a325-\u00a330 a head. In my experience the service has always been very good \u00a0friendly, attentive and helpful. The only downside is that the outdoor seating area at the front is on rather a busy road, but in the summer Kym's is blessed with excellent air-conditioning.",

Wong falls flat when it comes to food. \u00a0I only went for lunch, so I cannot comment on the dinner options. \u00a0The shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) were flavorless - the chef seemed to use a very lean meat, which rendered the dish without any fat. \u00a0This might be healthy, but it is not enjoyable. \u00a0A Wong's take on the shrimp dumpling is interesting - the skin was thicker than most dim sum shrimp dumplings but the shrimp was of a higher quality - however, they sprayed the shrimp dumplings in some sort of foam. \u00a0Not sure I like it, but maybe I do. \u00a0Need to think more about it. \u00a0The yangzhou fried rice was executed well. \u00a0The fried rice was a good value at 7 GBP, but the other items were expensive for what they were. \u00a0Finally, there was one waiter but about 7 chefs - the service was fine but very slow.",

We ordered the crispy duck with pancakes & plum sauce, chicken wings filled with prawns & black pepper sauce, dimsum basket, egg fried rice and wanton soup. Most impressive were the dimsum and the chicken wings. Both had a touch of creativity on top of solid quality. The egg fried rice was good as well. However, I was disappointed with the duck and the wanton soup -- in my view, both were a bit off from the traditional authenticity nor had proper modern creativity. Ambience was good, but it can get quite noisy, so do not come if you're looking for quiet and intimacy. Service was also reasonable -- prompt and patient as we took our time to decide what to order. Would go back for the dimsum and the chicken wings -- and maybe to try a few other dishes.",

    "text": "Attire- CasualCost- Ten Course Tasting Menu 55\u00a3/per person Wine bottles 30-35\u00a3 RangeService- Attentive, Friendly, Well InformedLets just say that I learned quite a bit about Chinese history during my ten courses at A Wong. Chef and owner Andrew Wong himself personally toured much of China and its 14 national borders to craft a ten course tasting menu that built upon the diversity that makes up Chinese cuisine with respect to each region. Throughout our meal, we took a tour through the spicy peppers of Sichuan, cumin flavors of Shaanxi province, famous Xiao Long Bao of Shanghai and lemongrass from the Yunnan province. Each flavor influences by flavors from neighboring countries.We were greeted by a gregarious hostess who throughout the night we were able to see how much she enjoyed interacting with what appeared to be regular patrons. By the end of the night we knew why. We decided to go with the ten course tasting menu and started off with two glasses of very reasonable priced (9.50\u00a3) sparkling wine from England (look for our post on sparkling wines from England later). We ordered a bottle of crisp Sauvignon from Touraine France for dinner.An amuse bouche was promptly bought to the table consisting of a cold jellyfish with a tapioca rice cracker. It was accompanied by a duck sauce as well as house made pork jerky, pickles and saut\u00e9ed onions.Shrimp Dumpling with citrus foam atop and pork dumpling (Dueling Dim Sum)The first course was a dueling Dim Sum with a pork dumpling and a shrimp dumpling with a citrus foam on top. This was followed by 63 degree egg. From what we learned, these tea eggs are very common in Chinese street markets so it came with an incense to mimic the smoke you might smell at a street market. The egg is poached in tea and comes served on top of shredded phyllo dough. I was amazed the the flavor of tea was appreciate even with the powerful creaminess of the yolk.The following dish was Xiao Long Bao, soup dumplings. These are very famous in Shanghai and have been super popularized by Din Tai Fung. There is an art to eating these without spilling the soup inside. sadly Tim hasn't learned.The following dishes consisted of abalone with with shiitake mushrooms, sea cucumber and abalone butter.With the following dishes, we slowly moved from the central Anhui province to the periphery of the country with the northern province of Shaanxi and southern province of Yunnan near Vietnam and Laos. From the Anhui province, we experienced red braised fermented cod fermented cold belly, with traditional Chinese vegetables on the side saut\u00e9ed in bean curd and shrimp butter. This dish also came with a side dish of fermented shrimp that could be brushed on the cod belly. we were told a small amount goes a long way and they were right. If you love the tanginess of fermented foods you would love this dish.To the North, we experience Shaanxi pulled lamb \"burger\" with red onion, pomegranates, lettuce cumin seed and peanut sauce. Lamb is very big in Shaanxi province and the cumin, peanut and pomegranates is influence by the very North and West province of Xinjiang which borders Pakistan and India and has a very large Muslim population.As we travel to the South we experience Yunnan seared beef with mint, chili and lemongrass that gave the dish a berry tart and sweet flavor. This was served on top of thin noodles and truffles. Vietnam flavors very much play a part in the cuisine of Yunnan Province which it borders.Next we travel to the area of China famous for there Sichuan peppers. The next dish consisted of a Sichuanese aubergine with Gong Bao Chicken Lettuce Wrap. The pepper in the aubergine transformed your last buds from spicy last to a salty metallic taste to almost a numbing feeling that was something never experienced before. The lettuce wrap provided a nice cool and crispy balance to the spice of the aubergine. Tim was super excited to try this dish but little did he know what his taste buds were in for.The next dish was the perfect follow up to the spice of the previous dish and consisted of chili barbecued pineapple with Beijing street yogurt. The yogurt came in a simple syrup that added just the appropriate sweetness to the tartness of the yogurt.To end a fantastic tour of Cantonese Culture, we ended our meal with a blood orange meringue filled with blood orange sorbet accompanied by sugar dusted lotus. In Chinese Culture, the lotus symbolizes the ultimate purity of the heart and mind and perfection. I can honestly say that this was a meal that I won't forget quickly. The staff were amazing, the concept is ingenious and the execution with perfect. I highly recommend you visit A Wong next time you are in London.Furthermore, A Wong was recently award 3 AA Rosettes for culinary excellence.",

    "text": "I tried to eat here last year, finally I made it there tonight and I'm clearly too late on the scene. Despite being the critics and bloggers darling restaurant of London over the past two years it was very disappointing. Ok only \u00a3120 for 3 people including a decent bottle of Viognier for dinner, but the standard of food was average. In fact the starters were terrible. Pickled cucumbers - not a patch on real smacked cucumbers. Sweet and sour rib - lacking in meat and a sauce that lacked any character. 63 degree tea egg - no tea flavour, no tea markings on the egg white at all (although still the best tasting snack we had). Longjing, garlic and chilli prawn - lacking in tea flavour and depth of umami. BBQ pork jerky - embarrassingly small (how can a main only cost twice as much as this slither of meat), can buy better from Taiwan. Was it an off day in the starter section? Surely it had to be with such great reviews and accolades aimed at this place. Luckily the mains were better, most were average with a few dishes like the market green vegetables, anhui fish belly, and the wagyu beef fried rice being quite good. Phew! Although to be frank not good enough to make me return.Very disappointing given the rave reviews. Of course it's better than the restaurants in Chinatown catering for tourists, but it's also obvious why there wasn't a single table of Chinese customers in a busy restaurant. Leave this one to the media worshippers who value hype and media coverage more than actual taste. \u00a0But maybe you'll think this is good Chinese food. If so, you're in luck as there's much better to come in your food adventures.PS. For heaven's sake give me proper chopsticks instead of disposable wooden ones. But maybe all the money was spent on PR and social media instead of appropriate chopsticks.",

We didn't have one but luckily there were some spaces at the counter. A simple but comfortable layout inside leaning to the clinical rather than sumptuous but most importantly, the food is super good.The open kitchen is in full view of diligent chefs with precision focus, carefully carving up choice pieces of Peking duck and using temperature probes to ensure perfection. Not your standard Chinese.The prawn cracker really is the best ever. A single, huge thing forming a nest for some crispy seaweed and various micro dice pickles and full of flavour. Dim sum are served as single pieces. A mini shanghai dumpling with vinegary soup inside, a quail egg croquette puff with foam top, scallop puff with XO sauce appeared like a mini flower encased in an orange crisp puff pastry (but wasn't the best overall of the selection) and a deep fried prawn \u00a0ball with abalone and chilli vinaigrette which was the highlight for me. Together with a very good spring roll and some Singapore noodles, this was quite a treat. The presentation was tops and the flavours and textures were quite special.There are standard dishes as well as dim sum available. I'd love to return for the chef's tasting menu.The staff were friendly and prompt and the bill wasn't as much as we we were expecting so overall top rating for me.",

Wilton Road has a great mixture of different eateries and this is a place to treat yourself with something different. Not many tables - so book ahead for groups of more than 2 I would say. Only seating that was available on my visit were the high chairs at the bar - which I would normally not be keen on for comfort and space - but they were better than expected. They do a set menu for lunch which won't leave you stuffed but is a really nice showcase of the interesting flavour combinations and textures that the menu has. Delicious dim sum that I could have eaten many many more and delicious flat noodles that, surprise surprise, I could have had double of. Very intrigued by their peking duck feast which requires 48 hour notice before ordering and is described as an 8 course banquet.",

Wong is the type of place I would LOVE to have in Chicago for a sophisticated, delicious dim sum outing.We ordered a pretty long list of items between the two of us... Some highlights included the sweet & sour rib (I ordered a second round - perfect sauce, tender meat, not too fatty), sugar coated pork bun (second favorite - amazing sauce on the pork inside, and the sugar is just right on the outside), the buttered shredded chicken was outstanding. The tea egg was interesting, but not sure it was worth the price.The tiger prawn was simply, but perfectly seasoned - but at 3 pounds for 1 prawn it wasn't worth it.Between us I think we ordered 17 or 18 dim sum/dishes plus 2 glasses of wine and 2 espressos - bill for lunch was 80 pounds.

    "text": "Service always has been one of the, if not the most important elements to the overall dining experience, it doesn't matter how good the food is, if the waiters were being stuffy, uninterested or rude, I would just not go back. Some restaurants, would as far as state that to have a successful run restaurant business, 70% is down to the service alone. The overall service level in London has always been of a high standard, I don't ever recall encountering a restaurant with outrageous and disgraceful service but there is always a first time right? Absolutely, and the award goes to A Wong, a Chinese restaurant in Victoria, London.After placing our orders, we waited for over 30 minute and still no sign of our food, and when I checked with the waiter, he checked for us but never returned to explain what was happening, another 10 minutes gone and the food finally arrived, so it seems like he had forgotten our orders \u00a0but not willing to admit it at the same time. We ate in frustration while through the whole dinner, not one single waiter bothered to approach to check on us, never once did they help us with topping our wine and tea, all the staff treated us like 3rd class citizens and showed no interest whatsoever.The food was over priced, all the dishes were tapa sizes and only enough for one person, the fried beef noodles was 50% more expensive than most restaurants in China Town but 50% smaller in portion at the same time, and frankly enough, quality wise it wasn't much different. What can I say? It was the most painful dining out experience I've ever encountered, the staff were rude and unfriendly to say the least, the joke was when I asked for the service charge to be removed from the bill, the waiter didn't even bother to asked what was the problem which pretty much summed up their unprofessional manner and attitude.",

But worse still, the food arrived cold, and when we pointed this out to the waiter, he refused to take it back to the kitchen, and made the excuse that it shouldn't be too hot to eat! We managed to get the food reheated by speaking to a different member of staff. Food was a let down - we were excited by the good reviews here on Yelp but the flavours were dull, and my wife's lamb burger was overcooked. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "The feng shui inside might be stunning but it's difficult to imagine many less auspicious locations in zone 1. A Wong sits like a slightly out of place squat granite and glass monolith among the mediocre lunchtime options and sandwich chains of Wilton Road. Laid back decor inside, a clean mix of Scandinavian woodwork and soft straight stone lines. There are three menus, a lighter dim sum focussed lunch menu, a more substantial evening list and a tasting menu spanning the both. They all dip in and out of a range of regional specialisms, so Sichuan standards like Gong Bao chicken and dry fried beans rub noses with braised lettuce, Imperial dishes and Yangzhou fried rice.Prices are reasonable across the board, though at \u00a31.50 a piece the dim sum will mount up pretty quickly. It isn't the place for a weekend blow out, but then you're unlikely to see many people round here during the weekend other than the confused tourists disembarking from Victoria station. Of particular note is the express menu, with two courses, a drink (and two lovely salted caramel petits fours) for a very reasonable \u00a312.95. A trio of dim sum wouldn't usually come close to satisfying me, even as a starter, but these are monsters. That classic shrimp har gau, here at least half again as big as the tiddlers I'm used to in Chinatown, came with an innovative twist, a protective bubble coat of sharp citrus and yuzu foam. That other stalwart pork and prawn siu mai came with its own welcome innovation, a tiny sliver of puffed pork crackling, texturally complimenting the freshly steamed and freshly made parcel. A grease free and delightfully crispy pork wonton completed the set, as delightful a dim sum experience as I've had in this country. Of the four or so mains offered with the express menu, I went for Sichuanese speciality dan dan mian, or peddler's noodles, named after the distinctive cooking pots they were served from by wandering street sellers. Whenever I've had it before, the soft minced beef, seasoned with those numbing Sichuan peppercorns, mixed with chunks of chilli, veggies and noodles has come in a spicy broth made of noodle water, Shaoshing rice wine and stock. Here it comes, with a few beansprouts and a single vegetable, in a thick meaty gravy, dumped over pedestrian noodles. Not unpleasant per se, but unexpectedly dry, overly rich and not much to my taste. I'll be back, if not for the tasting menu, certainly for a more detailed examination of the evening menu and some more of that super sized dim sum. The sun was out, and the open plan airy space will be gorgeous come the summer. Let's hope that the locals can tear themselves away from Nando's and the infinitely inferior Dim T just up the road and support the new kid on the block.",

    "text": "We had looked forward to trying A Wong after reading good reviews about the deliciously unique dim sum. The taste and presentation of the food did not disappoint, although be prepared for an expensive version of dim sum with very small portions. One piece really means one small piece. Unfortunately, the service was on the complete opposite side of the spectrum and it was the worst service in London that I can remember. We were enjoying our food but one friend had not received anything she ordered, so we kindly asked the servers about the missing items. We were told quite rudely that we had received everything we had ordered before they had actually even checked that we had. We again stated that we had not received everything we ordered (we would know better I would think if one person had not received any of her food), and after some arguing we asked to speak to the manager. The manager turned out to be the woman who had taken our order. Without hesitation she also insisted we had not ordered what we said we had ordered. Even when we listed the specific items we were missing, she insisted loudly and very rudely that we had never ordered those items. I suggested that she could check her notepad where she had written the items down, and when she did so she realised that indeed she had forgotten to place the items on the back side of the page into our order. Instead of apologising, she just muttered \"I guess it was my fault\". Unbelievably bad behaviour in any restaurant, but especially when one tries to charge several pounds for each piece of dim sum. When she continued to argue about the missing order while telling us she did not have an attitude problem, we asked to speak to the owner to complain. This did no good at all because the manager is the wife of the owner, and he said that she is in charge of the customers. It made me think of the advice never to work with close family.... We will never go back and even though I'm usually too busy to bother writing reviews, this service was so appalling I felt it my duty to give a review of the restaurant and recommend that others AVOID it! There are so many other great places to try in London with owners who actually appreciate their customers. And I have some constructive suggestions for the restaurant if they are unable to employ a suitable manager with customer service skills- maybe they should number the menu and let people write down their own orders like other dim sum restaurants. At least then the customer might actually get what they ordered and limit their interaction with the disrespectful and rude staff.",

If you manage to get a table, you should most definitely go!!We shared a few of the dim sums and snacks first:Chengdu Street Tofu (very nice), Shangai steamed dumpling ( like xao long bao), Sechuanese chicken and peanut bonbon, Wagyu tart with black beans, Isle of Mull seared scallop and cheung fun, Steamed duck yolk custard bun (a must order), Pork and prawn dumpling, wild mushroom and truffle steamed buns, clear shrimp dumpling and rabbit and carrot glutinous.We also shared a crispy duck and Singapour noodles.Overall I would say certain dishes and presentation deserve the Michelin star but others may not be as up to par. However this is fine Chinese food for a fairly democratic price and it was delicious enough that I would love to come back if I ever manage to get a table again",

Typical dim sum restaurants always serve their dishes in portions of three, and we've never been able to enjoy the full selection of the menu as a party of two.A couple of our favorites from A.Wong:- Shrimp Dumpling, Sweet Chili Sauce, and Citrus Foam - loved the bright acidity of the citrus.- Honey Baked Pork Pasty- Steamed Duck Yolk Custard Bun (presented like a peach)- Shanghai Steamed Dumpling with Ginger Infused Vinegar - very juicy though the skins got stuck together and we broke the dumpling :(Given that we were ordering piece by piece, we were able to try the entire menu (except for the rabbit puff). We do wish that there were more vegetable/steamed options available on the menu, but dim sum traditionally has more starchy, fried courses. Overall, we felt like that this was a fantastic dining experience, and are looking forward to trying out more dim sum the next time we're in London!",

Could have definitely eaten more. Then I had the crab and seafood in braised leaves...wow. The broth was so flavorful that I wanted to tilt the bowl and drink it. Very very delicious and surprisingly filling for such a delicate dish.After dinner I decided on another drink so I went downstairs to the Forbidden City bar in their basement (only access through the restaurant). The decor was very early 20th century opium den and the staff was again great. They have a specialty old fashioned on their menu that contains duck fat. I had a standard old fashioned (my bartender's 1st!) and it was delicious.

We tried going here for dinner last night and they were completely packed! Disappointed but sure to return we made reservations for the following night. The atmosphere is very hip and young. The food is trendy and beautifully made. The flavors are there in every fish. We ordered the dim sum and egg waffle for apps and shared the garlic lobster and egg fried rice for the main course. I did feel that the food was overpriced but for a Michelin star restaurant I would guess that makes sense.",

The tapioca pearls were a nice touch and something different than roe. \u00a0 One thing that was very simple and very good was the mixed greens with shrimp butter and fermented tofu. \u00a0A really enjoyable dish with a depth of flavor. \u00a0The lamb burger was very nicely done and super flavorful. \u00a0Desserts were creative and tasty. \u00a0Probably the best thing was the Yunnan seared beef with mint. \u00a0This was like a party in your mouth! \u00a0Well balanced, full of flavor, the beef was great, the mint fried to add to a bit of fun and flavor. \u00a0I could probably eat this everyday for a week. \u00a0totally enjoyed the hints of modernist techniques in this mean and the depth of flavors. \u00a0This is a must go to place next time I'm in London and a place to tell your friends about. \u00a0If you are looking for something refined and interesting this is the place. \u00a0Service was excellent and the smells coming from the open air kitchen made me hungry for more and got me guessing about the next dish that was about to come out.",

    "text": "A.Wong. \u00a0A recent Michelin star and a mark of 5 in the new edition of the Good Food Guide are both to be taken seriously, and A.Wang is no disappointment. \u00a0Andrew Wang is British born of Chinese descent, and had travelled extensively in China. His 10-course tasting menu, a culinary journey through the vast county of his ancestors, is not cheap, especially in a country where cheap High St Chinese is ubiquitous but seldom good, but the quality of cooking and presentation is as far removed from the ordinary as is the \u00a370 price tag. \u00a0It's enough to say here that no dish disappointed, most excelled, and one or two were quite stunning. \u00a0The meal takes 2.5 hours and is worth both the time and the money if you want subtly, variety and polish. \u00a0If not, your local Chinese will do you a sweet-sour pork and egg-fried rice for a fraction of the price. \u00a0But you will be much the poorer for it, at least gastronomically speaking. Highly recommended",

    "text": "I'm soon leaving London after living here for over 5 years. And as every good urban explorer, I have a list of things-to-do. A visit at A. Wong had been bookmarked ever since I saw the reviews of trusted Yelpers like Rich M and Steve B. And so - with a mere two weeks to go - I had to create a carefully worked out schedule and tonight it was time for A. Wong. Blissfully disregarding the other Yelpers comments on making a reservation even for lunch time, I showed up for dinner without announcement. But it was Monday night and the restaurant was able to accommodate me immediately. In fact, it was rather quiet and so I enjoyed the attention and great hospitality of many of the waiting staff. The waitress who welcomed me, offered me a seat at a table, but spotting the stools at the bar, I asked to be sat there; I much more enjoy sitting at a bar, when it's just me. And especially in this case, I was able to get a seat with view into the open kitchen, where a small army of chefs was already handling a set of woks in a skilled manner - I love when the entire wok lights up in flames when whisked about. I asked the waiter to help me choose from the menu, which was thankfully not as jam-packed as you can typically expect from a Chinese restaurant. In fact, I loved the simplicity of it. The waiter suggested the following: dim sum basket to start with, crispy chilli-caramelised beef & slow-raised pork belly as mains. I took him up on the latter two dishes, but declined the dim sum starter. This I replaced it with strir-fried mixed vegetables. I ordered egg-fried rice on the side. My selection turned out to be excellent; I especially loved the pork belly. The sauce was so good that I used the rice to soak up every last drop of it. The caramelised beef reminded me in its preparation of the traditional crispy orange beef. Excellent as well. The veggies and the rice were lovely as well. A. Wong is not your cheap whole-in-wall Chinese restaurant. But, given the high standard of cooking and the excellent service, I find the prices to be adequate. Granted, it was twice as much as I would typically spend on a weeknight evening, but given that I was on a very special quest, I allowed for some adjustments in my budget. The interior of the restaurant is not necessarily my taste. To me, it's a bit too clean and modern. But since I've never been a man known to have a superior judgement in design, you might as well disregard my opinion here. All in all, I'm very happy to have heard about this place and managed to tick it off my list. Actually, I would even go as far and say that this has been the best Chinese food I've eaten in London. Now, off you go...",
