    "text": "So there's a lot of love for the cafe part of Look Mum No Hands. But what about the bike shop bit? Definitely the best service I've received on my Dutch bike. The fact that they even embraced my Dutch bike with such enthusiasm after it was damaged in a crash is laudable: various other bike shops shied away from helping after learning that my bike was a chain case-equipped, everything-internal Dutch bike. That LMNH then proceeded to do a perfect job, getting everything right first time (servicing the gears, brakes, installing a new fork and handlebars) is an unheard of experience for me in the two years I've had my Dutch bike. It was also remarkably good value: just \u00a320 for a basic service and \u00a345 to install a new fork and handlebars (purely labour: I supplied the new parts).As for the cafe bit of LMNH, I can see why it's so adored: loads of space and seating, large windows through which plenty of natural light streams through, free wifi and mains sockets everywhere - this is a very pleasant place to setup with a laptop. The crowd is a pleasant mix of cyclists and hipsters, the latter offering excellent people-watching potential.I don't think cafe is perfect: the service, though friendly, can be a little too laid back sometimes; the food prices are I think slightly on the high side; I was slightly underwhelmed by the coffee, which seemed a little weak (next time I'll try a stronger one). Still, the abundance of natural light, friendly service, great atmosphere supportive of cyclists of all denominations and unusually good bike service makes it clear 5 star material. Even though it's on the wrong side of London for me, it's unquestionably where I'll be heading the next time my bike needs a service.",

Im just a broke ass student looking for a place to do my dissertation!Great atmosphere, lively but chilled out enough to get some work done. A little thing to note however, the wifi. The wifi is unforgiving when it comes to throttling (for any non-tech heads, its when you use too much internet that it caps your speed). I found i was unable to listen to 8tracks, youtube or last.fm whilst browsing without getting throttled, it was fairly crowded however, but i still felt this shouldnt happen!Other things id like to elaborate on but too tired to articulate would be:- Loads of power sockets on benches- Its a bike shop- bus stop right outside",

Doubling as a bike shop, this amazing spot is exactly what you need. Been wanting to try them since they sold me a Kernel IPA by Waterloo Bridge last summer. Thanks to the second transit strike this year, I rode my bike home from work and, just as I was getting tired, passed by this urban oasis for cyclists. Could not have been better timed. Try their smoothies, shakes, pastries, coffee, or great beer while your bike gets serviced, or just to have a quick rest. Perhaps the most cycle-friendly cafe in town. Maybe because it's such a nice day, I'm having a hard time leaving the outside seating space, especially since I can keep an eye on my bike. However it is 6pm and a huge crowd is gathering, which is another good sign, I suppose. If places like these were more common, I'd ditch my Oyster card immediately. Perhaps I will just so I can ride by it each afternoon. In any event, hoping to be back soon.",

They serve excellent Americanos, and in the summer, their blended coffee drinks are close to perfection. They use powder instead of syrup in their blended drinks, which improves the consistency. They are also not excessively sweet, which is a rarity in the world of blended iced coffee drinks.In addition to their superb coffee, LMNH serves the freshest tasting soups and salads in the area. Their sweet potato, coconut and coriander soup is addictive and is better than anything served at the nearby Nusa. They offer a variety of fresh salads using seasonal ingredients as well.The only reason I am not giving this place five stars is because occasionally when you order a mixed salad, they give you different salads than they display in the glass cases, which is misleading. Once I ended up with a salad plate consisting mainly of creamy potato salad (which I despise) and pesto pasta, with no sign of the fresh-looking shredded beetroot or jerusalem artichoke salads that were calling to me from the glass cases when I placed the order. They should be upfront about what a mixed salad box consists of each day.All in all, this is a wonderful place to stop by for a coffee and a cake, or a soup or salad and a glass of wine or bottle of beer. On a sunny day, their outdoor patio is a peaceful place to spend the afternoon.",

Her back tire was in serious need of air and it was slowing me down on the street of London. As I can in, the very helpful lady have a quick look and then pointed me in the direction of the pump. After explaining that I didn't have a clue what I was doing, she kindly showed me, without making me like I'm an idiot who shouldn't own a bike and then let me do it myself.I left in 10 minutes with a happy bike and it didn't cost me a penny.

It's spacious and inviting, both day and night. During the daytime and in good weather, the large doors open up allowing the fresh air and abundant light to poor in. At night, candles are lit and music plays softly. I grab my freshly squeezed orange juice, daily, on my way back from getting some mighty good toast down the way and return at night for some tea or coffee with friends. Mum's has a great mix of people, and everyone is so so so nice. Free wifi and the whole bike concept makes this place one of my faves so far. I'm gonna look for a bike next week. =)",

I like to think that it is healthy but I don't really care when it tastes this good. \u00a0The coffee is not quite up to the standards of London's best but is perfectly serviceable. During le Tour, LMNH shows the stages live on a drop down TV. \u00a0It must be the only place in London to do so. \u00a0Grabbing a beer watching cycling's legends power up alpine slopes makes me feel slightly guilty. \u00a0However, save for being road side, I can't think of a better place to watch the action unfold.",

I don't know, I was never a person who could work well in a quiet place...like for example a library. Here's the thing with libraries: when I'm in a library, I expect people to be quiet...and I get very irritated when people do otherwise. In fact, it totally wrecks my concentration when people whisper around me, because all I can concentrate on is whether I want to tell them to shut up or not and punch their face!On the other hand, I expect a coffee shop to be lively and so I don't mind people chit-chatting around me...quite the opposite; it has an invigorating effect on me! Anyway, what's that got to do with \"Look Mum No Hands\"? - Everything...this place would have been among my favourite study places if I were still a student: lot's of tables, plenty of outlets, free wifi, lots of day-light, friendly staff...a real cubicle-on-the-go! On top of that, I love the idea of combining a bike shop with a coffee shop; in fact, I believe that bikers are the Bohemians of the 21st century and so it only makes sense for them to hang out here.Plus, the coffee was really tasty, which is always a plus for a coffee shop, right?",

It's not the cleanest (the cushions on the V bench are worse for wear) but it also feels a bit like a workshop, so the worn-in feeling fits. \u00a0Plus, it makes it feel so informal and comfy.Quality coffee: Yeah! \u00a0And a few good teas, too. \u00a0Plus, kindly, they bring your drinks to you and bus dishes often.Snacks: I had a jacket potato, because it was rainy and it felt right, but it was really an incredibly uninventive choice, given the pies and salads and specials and stuff. And they have daily specials (and lots of vegetarian options). \u00a0They also had some interesting cakes (or non-cakes, like the green olive twist thing my friend got). Price: Normal, \u00a32-3 range for drinks, and you can grab lunch for about \u00a35Wi-fi: Free, fast, and long lasting with all of those outlets!Truthfully, I didn't sense or notice any kind of bike-shop stuff going on. \u00a0I also wasn't looking. \u00a0We did sit here for four hours, though, over three rounds of drinks, and it was totally easy to hunker down and get some work done.",

After several visits, I've found that the flat whites can be hit-or-miss depending on the barista, but in general, it's decent. I haven't gone for the bike service because I don't own a bike, but it seems like a neat place for cyclists to not only get their bikes serviced but also to congregate for regular cycle rides through the city.NOW. Onto the really important thing: the GUINNESS CHOCOLATE CAKE. I've had quite a few versions of a guinness chocolate cake and LMNH has, hands down, THE best one. I don't know what they put in it, but the flavour fills your senses with the divine mix of guinness and chocolate. The texture is moist, and there's always the right amount of cream. Just writing about it makes my mouth water and my craving shoot of the wazoo.OK, calming down now. The other cakes are actually very good as well, so even if they didn't have the guinness chocolate cake there, you'll have other great options. I am intending to try the food some time, especially since their selection of drinks is pretty attractive. Fab place to relax, work, or meet up with friends - definitely recommend!

As soon as you walk in, you are surrounded by a range of bicycle accessories and supplies they sell; if I were a cyclist, I would definitely make this part of my daily route.During my visit, I ordered an Earle Gray tea and a raspberry tart. The tea came with it's own pot and a side of milk. I really enjoyed the tea, however they make it a tad stronger than what I am used to. I asked the gentleman behind the counter what pastry he would recommend and he asked me a series of questions which resulted in me ordering the raspberry tart. I would definitely recommend it!I love the amble seating, natural lighting, and friendly service. I saw many people enjoying breakfast entrees, so the next time I'm in town, I am definitely making this my breakfast spot!

Switch it off and people melt away.Its hugely important to remember that the prices that LMNH are charging reflect more what they can get away with rather than the quality of what's being served. Too many coffee shops see the amount of froth they give on a latte as a good way of enhancing their profit margins. Considering the small size of the cup LMNH uses the amount of froth served means that the actual amount of coffee you get is pitifully small for just shy of \u00a33. I was also surprised to note that the coffee wasn't anywhere close to being 'hot'. Given the choice I'd have a Starbucks 'Clover' over this any day.My mate a non-coffee drinker (I know I know) had a hot (supposedly) Chocolate. lets just say you wouldn't want to be serving this to the kids as they'd bouncing off the walls for days judging by the sweetness. Again it would be perfectly possible to sell a quality hot chocolate for the price and size LMNH serve but nowhere near as profitable.Didn't have time to get any food but the prices looked off putting. In fairness the salad did look a good size.If I had to sum up LMNH it would be \"All mouth and no trousers\" or \"Look! The Emporer has no clothes on!\" Others might look the other way when it comes to quality because it's 'trendy' but I don't and won't!!!!",

It has plenty of tables and comfy places to lounge during the day. I wish something like this existed in any other city I have been to. It is frankly, quite brilliant. There are a lot of tires hanging from the ceiling. There is a poster with a 70s sexy bicycle woman with a round booty wearing a g-string next to the toilet.I really like this place. BUT:......55 pence to substitute soya milk instead of cow? This is about 90 cents for a milk substitution in USD. The eco-friendly implications of bicycle riding mars the gross overcharge of eco-friendlier means of milk drinking. Cow causes more carbon emissions than any other milk source. Grazing cows release more gas from digesting the wheat it eats.Britain seems in general to be a lot more friendly when it comes to not charging for soya milk. Brick Lane Coffee does not charge. A handful of others don't either. Some charge 30p, or less. I'm seriously glad I like your loose leaf teas enough to disregard getting any kind of latte or hot chocolate, with soya.I really wouldn't mention the soya charge if I thought Look Mum No Hands! was lame enough not to care. Consider dropping the soya charge all together. An extra 55p translates to not very cool.",

    "text": "This place is a star among the London coffee scene. And that's probably the main issue. They are so famous and successful that they don't seem to care about the customer service nor the quality anymore. \u00a0Ok, it's a nice concept (although not so original these days), the settings are impressive and their coffee cups are funky. \u00a0And that's all ! \u00a0When I came there to try the \"institution\", I asked the guy at the counter \"What's a Chelsea Bun ?\" The answer with a rude tone was \"It's dough !\" Well thank you and sorry for not having a doctorate in english historical pastries but can you try at least not to be so arrogant with customers please ? \u00a0Because next time you come to Belgium and ask \"What's a stoemp ?\", I hope someone answers you \"It's food !\" \u00a0Look Mum No Friends ! \u00a0Trying to forget the silly answer, I've ordered a egg benedict and a long black. The egg was overcooked : the yolk inside was hard and dry, when it's supposed to be melting. So far, it's the first and only place in the whole London that screwed up a poached egg. Coffee was alright. Fortunately... \u00a0 Look Mum No Food ! \u00a0 Then, there is this sort of weird vibe around, especially if you are not a cyclist. I mean, almost everyone there is a tatooed grungy hipster in total bike gear, like they were about to climb the Mont-Ventoux. And it's also the headquarter of the Deliveroo guys between two sushi missions. So if you are a pedestrian without any tatoo and no purple hair, you almost feel like you're not in the right place. You don't fit the scenery. \u00a0 Look Mum no Pedestrian ! \u00a0And finally, there is the \"no laptop policy\" on almost every table, which once again doesn't help to make you feel comfortable or welcomed, whether you were about to pretend to work on your Mac or not. \u00a0Look Mum No Laptop ! \u00a0In the end, the general feeling I had with my \"LMNH experience\" was that you should thank them to tolerate you and give you the extraordinary perk of being one of their grateful customers, especially if you're bikeless.. \u00a0 Will you go back again, son ? Look Mum No Way !",

The main negative was that I was there for the dreaded no food 30 minutes, between 11 and 11:30. They still have some sad looking cakes and loaf slices, but that's it for food. So I ended up with a smoothie, which was tasty and pretty decently sized for the price.",

The best thing about this place is that it has a bar top area that has a good number of outlets underneath so you don't have to worry about finding a place to plug in your laptop, tablet, etc.I ordered a hot chocolate--it was more like a luke warm chocolate but the foam art on top was really cute. I also ordered a slice of one of the breads. I think it was banana but can't remember, that's how memorable it was. Whatever it was, it was definitely on the dry side. What was worse is that it came in a plate with dish washing powder still on it...not really that appetizing. I would come back for the wifi and power outlets but skip any drinks or food...so, really--why go back.",

The best part was they let dogs in and I had a few furry study buddies for the afternoon. The reason I'm not giving it a lot of stars is that the food was pretty bad. I got a soup and it was served almost cold and tasteless... They were nice enough to replace the bread with a side salad at no extra charge but it didn't taste of much either. \u00a0The coffee and service was super friendly and good but I'd not eat there again. However if you're just going to study, they won't bother you if you stay awhile and it's pretty comfy surroundings. My friend got a pie and didn't care for it either so maybe they can up the food a bit to meet the rest of the standards of the place because it's a really cool little spot.",

    "text": "\"Look mum, no hands\". I still remember shouting that to my mum when I was 11 and her shrieked reply of \"Bethany, watch what you're doing!\" - the look of horror on her face.Today however, no horror, no screaming but instead a unusual yet intriguing bike shop/cafe which has become infamous throughout Europe. We walked in and grabbed a table. We were here for a brainstorming session so we were looking for a relaxed work/lunch space and this place definitely fitted the bill! As you enter you can't help but stare at the different bikes on the roof and the quirky but simple interior. The food menu is varied and quite particular (in regards to salads - no fruit on my salad please) but the spread is vast and presented well on top of the counter and in the fridge.The woman behind the counter was slightly grumpy if I'm honest and not very warming but I ordered my food and grabbed a seat!I opted for the avocado/guacamole and wild mushroom on toast and the mushroom frittata topped with chorizo. I was hungry. The avocado and wild mushrooms on toast was truly delicious! There was a hint of lime running through the avocado and it complimented the mushrooms perfectly! As for the frittata, I liked it, I didn't love it - it became very samey very quickly and I found it slightly dull in flavour. \u00a0Overall though I had a truly pleasant experience at Look mum, no hands and really enjoyed our session there.OH and don't forget they have a bike shop for all you cycling enthusiasts out there!",

The place has a lovely interior that makes you feel comfy and relaxed. It is quiet and almost empty at such an early hour, but this way I can focus on work and enjoy my morning.

I had a goat cheese quiche with salad that was light and tasty - with cherry tomatoes and sweet potatoes drizzled in vinaigrette. Order at the counter and they bring your order to you.When you're a freelancer like me, you'll appreciate what I believe to the BEST part:Outlets can be found along the couches, which is also the best place to prop open your laptop.Give me couch, a power outlet and some food and good luck trying to get rid of me!Side note: No wifi from 11-4 Saturday and Sunday and from 11-2 Monday to Friday.",

I don't have a bike that needs fixing (or throbbing over) -- I'm too worried that I'll 1. get hit by a taxi, 2. get hit by a bus or 3. get stolen. \u00a0But I do love coffee and I do love sweet potato soup! A gal pal and I stopped in for a late Sunday lunch and enjoyed cold salad plates (this is a thing in London that I love -- salad plates, mixed all together and wonderful) -- green beans, noodles, all sorts of things. The sweet potato soup with corinader and coconut though? Out of this world -- hands needed, hands needed! Dig in. Counter service, a pretty laid back cafe. The din is minimal as folks hum over their laptops (free wifi abound). I actually do prefer the mellower vibe of Timberyard a few doors down, but \"Look Mum No Hands!\" is a pretty darn close second.",

It has a catchy name, doubles as a bike shop with cool hipster-y decorations, and has wi-fi (During peak hours, wi-fi is turned off - from 11-4 Saturday and Sunday and from 11-2 Monday to Friday). Wi-fi password is written on the till. The chai latte was one of the best that I've managed to get in London and that made me like this place right away. It had laid back vibe and I got work done easily in this atmosphere. I also tried their avocado toast with steak and it was really good. There's outlets along the walls where theres counters to work at and theres a couple of tables as well. They do host events sometimes; they started putting out \"reserved\" fliers and letting customers sitting at certain tables know that they would have to vacate those seats. They did this an hour in advance to the event, giving time to finish up or to move seats.",

I'd been told that as breakfast go, there are better choices locally, but the food here was good enough.I liked the idea of the black pudding-centric option, but decided instead on a smoked salmon and cream cheese, sesame seed bagel, and it was tasty!My pot of red bush tea was nice although the person behind the counter tried looked blankly at me until I called it by it's 'official' title, Rooibos - and then she tried to correct my pronunciation... I'm half South African, I know how to say Rooibos!Whilst we are talking about the staff, I found their lack of uniforms confusing. When I arrived there were a few staff members, or managers perhaps spread around the cafe on laptops, but I wasn't sure if they were patrons so asking to share a table (there weren't many free tables) was a bit shaky. I didn't realise they worked there until they kept wandering behind the counter.Overall not a bad breakfast, but I guess not owning a fixie, I didn't feel cool enough to sit in there.",

Also it to try some different roasts. That's service. I am not giving it five stars only because there are not many comfortable places to sit.

A comfortable seating area just for diners and a space by the window for the laptop brigade. The latter can happily type away sitting on their stools looking out at the hustle of the street. It also provides a workshop that fixes your bike while you have your meal. The first thing you notice is the cycling related items including the ancient bicycles that are arranged at the front of the cafe. Next the funky music hits you. If you like funk, like me, you will be chilled for the rest of the stay. The staff, and their were lots of them on a Sunday morning, \u00a0were polite and quick to get the order down. I had the Toast with avocado, salad and poached egg. Healthy and well made. I also ordered a latte which was a bit too milky for my taste. I sat down, enjoyed my breakfast, and planned where to hit next on this free Sunday morning. \u00a0 This is an excellent spot to chill and I cannot recommend it more to the cycling loners out there.",

Their steamed whole milk with thick matcha powder make for an exceptionally strong and hearty green tea latte. May just become addicted to these!

My partner's aunt who lives in the area had mentioned the place as they are dog friendly!This month(January 2018) they're trying an all vegetarian menu out and we were excited. As we are both vegetarians with inclinations towards trying to eat more vegan. \u00a0My BF ordered a cauliflower soup and it was delicious! It came with some flat bread on the side. And I don't even usually like cauliflower. When we came again it was the weekend and I was craving that soup! But they don't do soup on the weekends :( So BF had the mezze breakfast and I the toast.The vibe is chill and comfortable. They make a mean cappuccino, and the service is friendly and fast. I had ordered some toast which was cold on arrival and even though I had already eaten half of it they replaced the order for me with some warm hot bread. It's such a fun and nice place to sit in and hang out. Would go even for just the coffee and atmosphere. But as we're also excited about the vegetarian menu and they're looking for suggestions, make that cauliflower soup a regular, it's awesome! We would probably be here quite often if we lived nearby.",

    "text": "This is probably the ideal coffee shop to take my husband. While it's a nice (comfy, quiet, trendy) coffee shop to fulfill my needs, it also doubles as a bicycle repair shop to fulfill his needs. We rarely agree on coffee shops, but I think this might be the one place where we do.This place is located around the corner from my office. Every time that I have walked by there are always people working on laptops or informal business meetings occurring. Therefore, I came with the expectation that I may be able to get some work done. However, I think that I came at the wrong time (5pm) as this is when the coffee shop transforms into a pub. They serve beer & wine & coffee, which is great and all but the atmosphere was a bit more pubish in the evenings. This is my only complaint.On the other hand, the staff are very friendly. They have great customer service, which is not often found in London. The coffee is well coffee. All coffee tastes the same to me--maybe I'm a coffee moron. Overall, I'd come back, but I'd be aware of what time I came regarding work and noise level. It's great for a beer and conversation in the evening, but not so much work. I imagine that during the day it's the very opposite! :-)",

I popped here a couple of times for coffees while staying and working close by and the beans were right on the money, served up by very friendly staff. The general vibe is rough, ready, relaxing - just a great place overall. Great music too. I did pop in on the last day of my visit to grab a very tasty organic sausage and avocado roll - lovely sausage and bread, just be careful if you're in a rush and want it to go as it probably took about 15 mins to come out. Not their fault - just a heads up if you're in a rush as everything is cooked fresh. I'm not massively into bikes so I'll let some other reviewers tell you about that side of the business ;-)",

    "text": "In theory, this place sounds like a great idea. I always walk past on my way to work intrigued by the concept - a bike workshop which also sells cakes and coffee and beer for those a little more thirsty. I always imagined that especially for cyclists going past it must be some sort of haven of a pit stop that they can't find in the nearby Benugos. A marriage that random holds some sort of appeal and I decided to try it out to see if I could make it a regular walking pit stop of my own. I went in, with no cash - this was my first error and second error. When I asked if they accepted card he said yes, but once I had ordered and they had started making my coffee he told me it was \u00a35 minimum limit with no apology. Ok then. I ordered a croissant and canned drink which pushed it above the \u00a35 minimum spend. Once I had paid he moved on to the next customer without comment. The \"barrista\" made my coffee in a mug - I had asked for take away. Once I had told him this with a heavy sigh he poured it into a take away mug, sloppily with cold milk. No sign of my croissant that I had been forced to buy. I told the man I had ordered it from and he just stared at the selection as if expecting me to take it away with no bag. When I asked him for one he looked like I had asked for something outrageous but with dragging feet went to get me one. Whilst his feet were dragging I saw their loyalty cards - wont have a need for these I thought to myself. The rest of my journey to work was spent trying to keep a lid on the take away coffee cup, the rim of which had been saturated in the milk he clumsily poured on. I got coffee all over me. For some this kind of attitude from the too cool for school staff and client\u00e8le can't be too much of a turn off - it does seem irrationally popular. But if you, like me, appreciate the small things from cafes like warm coffee, customer service and not being ripped off then I'd stay on your bike.",

You don't need to be a cyclist. We take out-of-towners here to experience the London alternative vibe. A great mix of people, though mostly hip Guardian reader types (I'm the one with the Economist...). Look out for the hipster mums, dads and babies. Caveats: I'd prefer taps rather than just bottled beer. Sometimes the ales are chilled down too cold. Service can be spotty. I suspect their bike repairs/parts are not the cheapest, but again it's more convenient and pleasant than a typical bike shop.",

Winding down your day and want a beer or glass of wine? Stop here.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You get my point. You actually don't need any of those reasons to stop here, other than the fact that this is one of London's newest best kept secrets. Its a coffee shop/ bar/ bike shop, so if your in the need for a new tube for your tire or some caffeine they will be able to get you fixed up. The layout is amazing inside there are plenty of places to sit and hook up your laptop, and then there is amazing patio area to enjoy London on a bright warm day. There is a bike rack in the back and some spots on the wall to lock up to.My recommendation is try everything. I don't think they have anything bad on the menu. If you are from the states, try Vedett, it's an amazing beer on the blonder side. And don't forget to pick up a shirt and cycling cap. Support mom and pop shops, spread the word.PS- If you taking the tube here, go to the Barbican Stop and its a short walk from there.",

The punters seemed to be mainly those who were students who wanted to the bicycle cafe as a library for their free wifi so they would be sitting around on their computer, being quiet for ages or nearby \u00a0office workers, sitting on their own looking bored.  When I was there, no one brought in their bike or went to the bicycle section which was a real shame. \u00a0The decor was great and it was really handy to have a bicycle shop nearby, and lots of nice bike goodies, though I didn't think the bike caps, though fun and retro, were any good on London's roads with poor driving. I think the bicycle cafe is in the wrong place, and it is by a horrible and polluting busy road, \u00a0it doesn't really encourage cyclists passing through, I think it needs to be in a proper cycling area, near cycle paths and not in a 'trendy lefty area' . \u00a0It just seems to attract mostly the wrong types of people. It could be really friendly and informal in the right setting.",

And it is very cute, with its outdoor tables, wooden benches and gorgeous bikes displayed everywhere. And some of the staff are very sweet and friendly, one has sworn up and down to me that their ginger cake is the bestest. But others, well they are the proverbial Shoreditch twats, who should never, ever be working in customer service. \u00a0I'm afraid Look Mum may already be a victim of its own success and the nicer staff will give way to people with comical moustaches. One has the Hook, (mohammadi.ca/?itemid=388) I'm totally serious. But you know what, they have great food and plugs everywhere. Four stars for effort.",

So if I am biased in any way, blame it on the coffee! :)That being said, this place is wonderful! I love the laid-back vibe and the fact that they have created a very unique sense of place at this bicycle repair shop cum coffee shop. There is a long bar with stools facing the window so it's nice to come and just people watch. Also, a great place to study since it's not too loud. There is also an outdoor seating area, which I always find as a bonus when it comes to cafes. It is a tad pricey, if you ask me - considering my iced Americano and small slice of almond pound cake cost me close to 5 quid. But I wouldn't mind paying this for the good atmosphere. Cheers!",

I had a caramel flapjack thing that was quite good and the staff were all completely courteous and nice. They also don't seem to care when we whip out our laptops and sit a while.Maybe I just need to visit more to get it to the 5th star? I'd go back without any qualms, maybe I just can't commit to 5 because I'd feel like I'm cheating on my own neighborhood cafe. Yeah, that's it.
