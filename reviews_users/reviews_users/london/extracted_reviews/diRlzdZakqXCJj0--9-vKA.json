    "text": "The Oriental Canteen does precisely what it says on the tin: its serves basic Chinese and other popular Asian dishes in a very pared-down but clean setting. Seating is shared with other customers and service is to the point: there is normally a waitress waiting to take your order before you sit down. Now in most restaurants I would find that a supremely annoying trait. But it's just a part of the no-nonsense vibe in the Canteen. Sit down, shut up, stuff your face, then be on your way. The food itself ticks all the boxes for those in search of a cheap and filling meal for around a fiver. There is tofu and ginger stir fry, special fried rice, lots of noodle dishes, even Peking duck, and many dozens more. Other pluses are they serve Tsingtao beer, which is excellent with any Chinese food, and that the plain sticky rice served with most meals is delicious even on its own.",

The food is good quality and you get seated and served very quickly, provided of course that there are seats free, as being so popular it's usually pretty full! If it is, there's always the option for takeaway, they'll provide you with cutlery and you can wander around the corner and sit either on the steps of the V&A or there's a few little bits of greenery with benches around Thurloe St. The food is simple but tasty, and very cheap - you won't pay more than a fiver for a filling plate of food. The meat+rice dishes are always a good option, and if you run out of rice on your plate, they'll usually top you up for free. The OC is always full of Chinese people eating, and to my mind, if there's Chinese folk eating in a Chinese restaurant, it must be pretty authentic and tasty, and therefore worth a try.",

A group of us were there recently for the Pan-Asian Film Festival and with only a 30 minute break to the next film, we walked around hurriedly looking for a place. A short walk later, we spied Oriental Canteen which I've been once when I first arrived in London. In we went as there was a table large enough to fit us all. The dishes averages around \u00a35 and the place comprises mainly of students. The food was decent enough, tasty and quick. Sometimes you just want a quick bite and I found mine.",

As \u00a0challenging as hanging outside Tiger Tiger until you spot a failed reality TV contestant.It's instant gratification that feels good on the spot but later leaves you somewhat unsatiated. On the plus it's quick, cheap and fun and there is an interesting selection of Chinese canteen classics like fatty pork on rice and roast duck combined with Malaysian staples like sambar fish, roti and nasi lemak. It's better than spending your fiver at Boots or Pret, innit? But on the downside, you can see in clear view that so much of the food is not fresh but heat-lamp and microwave-cooked. It's the fake blond and fake tan of the culinary world. Cheap and easy.",

You could even say that they were trying to emulate the ramshackle hawker canteens in Malaysia with their artful use of brightly coloured, deliberately mismatched plastic cutlery and crockery.

Brave the shiny roast ducks hanging in the window near the door and you'll find a friendly spot to enjoy a quick lunch.All the dishes are advertised on the menu propped up in the window with their corresponding photos (why do they always o this!) but don't let the faded, yellowy pictures put you off as the food is good. I've tried their crispy duck pancakes as it does look very appetizing hanging there and you can smell it as you walk by, which is obviously their ploy. Their green tea is also very good, fresh from tealeaves and not a bag. There are mostly a couple of friends or often lone workers sat munching away so it's a very laid back go-in-eat-and-leave style place. The only problem I have with it is that you can feel like you're virtually on a plinth on the pavement if you sit in near the window. Being subject to gawping passers by as you try not to send your artfully balanced chopsticks flying (fork is a dirty word here) is a bit nerve wracking, so we only go if there is a table free on the other row, which is still very visible, but slightly less street level. It's much nicer than the one at the other rend of the street so it's definitely worth a try if you feel like Chinese for lunch.",

So not ALL bad.Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, but overall there was very little flavor and the taste that did exist, it was not a pleasant one. Best compared to watered-down microwave food. Even that is a bit better than this sad excuse for Chinese food. My stomach was already off-put by my trip to the bathroom, but one bite of the chunky brown mush, and my appetite disintegrated.

    "text": "This place was actually awful. Aside from the dirty feeling, the food was worth nothing. Got the chicken and noodles and there was zero flavor whatsoever. The chicken was so devoid of flavor it tasted like it had been rinsed under a tap. I actually dont think they owned any spices. I was hoping I could use the chili oil to add some flavor. Any. But I opened the container and immediately caught a whiff of how stale the oil was. I asked for sweet and sour sauce and they only had soy sauce. Which expired two years ago. I put it on anyways and it tasted so slightly rancid. I bore through two more forkfuls before I had to leave. Even though it was cheap I wouldve rather spent a few euro more for real food.",

The sweet and sour pork was passably Chinese, maybe a sliver of Chinese tasting herbs or something (it was more like sweet and sour vegetables w a bit of pork dribbled in). I'm Asian, I should know. The ONLY yummy food here? The ROTI. Trust me. Very very flavorful and served nice and hot. STAY AWAY from this place.",

We had the house specials of lamb stew with soup noodles \u00a35, beef stew with fried noodles, and pan fried \u00a0dumplings for \u00a37.5 \u00a0the fresh orange juice and fanta were 0.5\u00a3 each. Not fancy but affordable. Lots of reviews have noted the tired decor and called it dirty. \u00a0Adds to the charm of the place. It is unpretentious and a \u00a0canteen after all? There were big chunks of cabbage in the stew. Something you might get at home so it is not fine dining but hearty simple oriental food to fill up. Worth a visit if you are hungry and on a budget.",

    "text": "I have to confess to having a great attack of indecision as I walked past Oriental Canteen. I must have walked past this place at least 5 times trying to decide whether to chance going in - the owners probably thought I was going to rob them!In favour of the restaurant, AA Gill, the Times critic had named this place in this Best Eats of 2003 list.Against the restaurant, there was a tired photo montage of the different dishes available and the nice pictures on the walls inside were of dishes not on the menu.In the end, my quest for Malaysian food led me in as there were quite a few Malaysian dishes on the menu. I ordered the laksa, which is a curry broth containing noodles and a selection of seafood and meat.What arrived wasn't laksa but the broth seemed to be inspired more by Indian flavours rather than true south east Asian spicing. It was also alarmingly fluorescent yellow, perhaps indicating the use of a lot of tumeric.Sadly, standards seem to have dropped since 2003 or perhaps with the proliferation of Malaysian restaurants in the last few years, Oriental Canteen is no longer good enough",

    "text": "Hmmm what to say about the OC.I have to confess I didn't eat here and I probably wouldn't have gone in if my friend wasn't starving and needed a quick bit. First thing I noticed is that they only serve mains. I had already eaten but probably could have snacked on a side or starter but that wasn't an option so I had a Tiger beer which was only \u00a32.00 so that wasn't bad, especially for South Ken.My friend went for the Singapore fried noodles, which looked a little thin on content and was a very small portion. One thing I really hate is if you're going to do something, do it right and if not don't charge a fiver for a tiny almost dish.I have to say that the staff and service were both fantastic and just because of how they were, makes me want to go back again, but honestly I don't think I will be going back, and if it wasn't for them I probably would have only awarded two stars. However do not that I personally didn't try the food and my friend had no complaints and he has eaten there more than once.",

If you are looking for a nice place to have dinner and stay an hour, walk away. If you're picky about service, extra clean tables,...you're probably not in the right place. It is not dirty, not more than a regular fast-food like macdonalds or burger king; but not up to the standard of a nice restaurant obviously.Taste for basic dishes is not bad, you get serve in time, extra portion of rice is FREE if you order a rice-based dish (yaaaay ! ). I especially love the pan-fried dumplings, because you can taste there actually is meat inside and they taste good to me, not to mention cheap. I ate rice + barbecue pork if I recall, no bad surprise there, no good one either; quite generic.In the end, what's good is the price ! starts from 3\u00a3 (for my beloved dumplings) or 4\u00a3 for a rice dish.",

A group of us were there recently for the Pan-Asian Film Festival and with only a 30 minute break to the next film, we walked around hurriedly looking for a place. A short walk later, we spied Oriental Canteen which I've been once when I first arrived in London. In we went as there was a table large enough to fit us all. The dishes averages around \u00a35 and the place comprises mainly of students. The food was decent enough, tasty and quick. Sometimes you just want a quick bite and I found mine.",
