This is authentique Turkish cuisine with an element of sophistication to it. Pop in for a quickie which consists of a drink, a main and as much bread as you like, which is ideal if you are at work or go in your own time for a leisurely and relaxing time with lots of exciting and exciting dishes to choose from. Fish, game, Scottish steak ? and the more expected lamb dishes along with vegetarian and also some healthy options make this a place for all tastes. To be honest, I love it here and don't go enough. Based in Mayfair it is only a hop, skip and a jump from Oxford st, Regent st, Bond st or Kensington and should be experienced. Good honest food, well priced with excellent Turkish hospitality.",

While this is not a trendy restaurant you will find promoted to tourists, it is a great spot for dinner. We initially found Sofra about 10 years ago while staying in a hotel down the street. The restaurant is always packed, so I highly recommend making a reservation. \u00a0Service is quick and friendly.",

I think another large party had arrived just before us so we had to wait for a while to get our orders in. However after that little delay everything was very pleasing. I had the chargrilled lamb and beef and it was delicious. For desert I went with the homemade ice cream and was surprised at how rich and creamy it was.",

Spanakopita (they call it something else since it's a Turkish restaurant) was a 5, Tabouleh only a 3, homemade hummus also a 5, haloumi was only a 3. My son ordered the ground lamb with rice. He gave it a 3 to 4. The meat was very good but the rest was sort of bland.",

    "text": "We really wanted to go out for dinner with friends and we decided to go to the centre since it would be the easiest for all and taking into account that there were various culinary difference and requirements we decided to try a Turkish restaurant. So we ended up here.The place itself is easy to find and outside looks very upmarket. It is generally a white table cloth restaurant frequented by mostly people of the upper age limit. I found that the restaurant although is not bad the table are really cramped and you sit very close to your neighbour to the point you can hear the conversation. Food wise the quality was amazing but the menu was very restricted to the main dishes you can find almost in all Turkish restaurants. The main Turkish courses where very restricted but there was a good choice of BBQ meats. Deserts were also quite westernised. Wine menu was interesting consisting mostly of French and some Italian wines and a few Turkish ones. Now as i am really a fun of Turkish wines i was very disappointed not to find a bigger selection of Turkish ones.In general i got the feeling that this restaurant although not a bad choice is moslty targetting older local people and has given an extra care in westernising thei menu. Overall a good choice if you want to have an introduction to Turkish cuisine and/or you want to do it on the upper limit of the budget.",

He forgot the wine, the bread, the menus, to ask for drinks, etc..... The couple who sat next to us left after 10 minutes once they recognized the service level. The food was a 5 out of 10. Fine but nothing better than average. The bottle of Sauvignon blanc was served room temperature. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Lastly, I tend not to write bad reviews on Yelp. This one was our worst meal in London by far, and it needed to be called out.",

The mackerel was nothing to write home about. Great value and variety in the pre-theater menu. Good bread basket. I really liked the app sampler plate. The kunefe dessert was okay, like a baklava with a self-administered morphine drip. Add the gooey syrup to taste.",

This one I went to with a couple of friends to comiserate losing one of them to the cheaper yet more depressing location of South Manchester. And I should know, that's where I grew up!We had hummus, flatbreads, halloumi and spinach & feta parcels to start - very tasty, the halloumi had a touch of chilli to spice up the palette. I loved the parcels too, nice and crispy outside (ironically a touch too much cheese and not enough spinach).Then to the mains, lamb tagine for me and chargrilled lamb for the others. The Tagine was not what I expected, a nice sweetness from the apricots and raisins, but the lamb was on the bone, fatty and not in a tagine. The couscous was dry as well. The others had lamb that seemed ok. The main issue however was the service - rude, brisk and the waiters almost dropped the food on us whilst looking to seem like it was our fault. The restaurant downstairs was dirty as well, very small and cramped with a heater in the corner that basically roasted us all.Not the best Sofra by anyone's standards",
