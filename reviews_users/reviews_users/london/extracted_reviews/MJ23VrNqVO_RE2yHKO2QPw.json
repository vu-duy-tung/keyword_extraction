    "text": "Hm. Not sure why this place isn't getting the recognition that it deserves.But, to each their own, I guess.Anyway, it's been over a year since i last ate here, so I'm a little foggy at what I ate. However, I do remember that it was all sooooooo good and I walked away thinking this joint easily made my top 10 favorite restaurants. I recall that upon approach at the Borough Market, the restaurant looked quite, quite out of place among the hustle, chaos and bustle of the surrounding neighborhood. However, upon entrance into the restaurant, I was pleased at how elegant and wonderful the staff and decor was. On arrival, we asked about wine suggestions and were promptly led to some California selections. Of course, since we LIVE in California, we asked for something European instead, settling on a lovely Italian something-something. D'oh.Anyway, I only recall sampling the pork belly roast which was divine - crispy on the outside with tender (and very well seasoned) meat on the inside. Can't remember what side dishes came with it, but I seem to recall greens, for some reason. Dessert was some sort of apple crumble with vanilla pudding, which actually turned out quite wonderful (but unfortunately, I was too full to actually enjoy it).All in all, this place rocks! If I ever make it back to London someday, I'm making a beeline for ROAST.",

Thus, after browsing the stalls down below, we made a quick check of the menu and headed upstairs to Roast for a light lunch. I wanted to like it; the menu looked delicious and but unfortunately, they didn't seem to have anything on the menu. I ordered a salad with chicken, walnuts, and stilton. Mum ordered tomato and cheese. Sorry, miss, we're out of that salad.Alright then tomato and shallot.What about dessert? The crumble at the next table looked wonderful. I'll just have a scoop of ice cream. How about the caramel?We don't have that.But...it's on your menu.We don't have it.Ok then, the rhubarb.Alright.(Five minutes later)Sorry miss, we don't have rhubarb.Let's try the cheddar torte.Sorry miss, we're out.Elderflower ice cream then.Alright. (Ten minutes later)Here's your gooseberry ice cream.I realized later there were no walnuts on my salad. Out?",

The main was a grilled cod which was completely undercooked; sent it back and got a new one. Then, the dessert we chose was actually unavailable, yet it took a full 10 minutes for them to discover and inform us? By then we had to get back to work so we left without dessert. Servers seemed flustered and agitated with each other, there was apparent disorganization and lots of people waiting for their food.",

We took the risk and were lucky. Generally, I was underwhelmed by the menu and the food. It was standard breakfast food with nothing really exciting outside of the norm. We both ordered dishes with poached eggs. Both came out hard rather than with a runny yolk. Had to send them back. However, lunch was a different society and I think this is where I would recommend it. I went for the fish and chips which I think is a Friday lunch regular. Wow. The mushy peas were the best I have ever had. Both meals were not cheap, but their quality high. Oh, lastly, coffee was terrible, but we are both coffee snobs. Overall, go, enjoy breakfast but expect nothing out of the ordinary. Lunch, I think this is great mid-week if you are in the area or having a Friday off and tour the markets in the morning before a long lunch at Roast.",

Most of the food is purchased from the stalls below which I think adds a nice community touch.However the place is always brimming with smart city suit types who can sometimes become quite distracting as the tables are positioned relatively close together. The quality of the food is flawless though and even my fruit salad breakfast was pretty special. With a variety of decadent British dishes including pan fried Cornish skate and Roast rump of beef, the prices (around \u00a320 for a main) definitely reflect the quality.I would recommend going on a weekend as you then tend to avoid the hustle and bustle of the local workers.

Roast's location, on the first floor of Borough Market near London Bridge, is also supposed to reflect its menu choice of quality, fresh, British produce.As the name suggests, there is a focus on roasting as a culinary method. But this vague focus is stretched to fit a wide variety of meat, and fewer vegetable dishes. I tried the rack of Welsh lamb, and tasted the venison, which were both excellent. There were many more dishes on the menu I wanted to try.Prices are high, and the quality of the cooking reflects this, but the service wasn't too smart, unfortunately. The clientele on the night I visited seemed to be made up of either romancing couples, in the window seats, or large, raucous parties of office workers in the longer central tables.",

It's an absolute Borough hotspot, along with many other fine food establishments in an area that's already top on every foodies eating list.If you're a big meat eater then this is the place to go. I haven't found better meat fry-ups anywhere else, theirs is truly the full monty. I usually go for the 'Smoked streaky bacon and fried egg sanwich' that is roughly an entire pack of bacon in doorstop thick white bread with crusts that could fell a few teeth, dolloped with an egg and lashings of brown sauce. It was actually one of these that led me to abandon my vegetarianism (hey if you're gonna fall off the wagon then do it properly!) But saintly Vegetarians need not worry as there are also some great options like the healthier fruit salad or the muesli with Earl Grey prunes.It is a more up market affair in here, with a stylish yet still comfortable interior and a foodie crowd so I wouldn't recommend piling in after a heavy night out looking rather green. Pop in on a Saturday for the best breakfast south of the River and watch the market below. Breakie finishes at 11am on weekdays and 11.30 Saturdays, so don't lie in too long.",

Service - the coat staff were quite incompetent, with three of them leaving me waiting (and I was the only one there!) for over three minutes. It might not sound like a long time, but it is when you're being ignored and in a restaurant! - I don't think I've ever had a less enthusiastic waiter. No smile, no hello, no goodbye. When questioned \"what's the special?\", the reply was a one word \"mussels\". No price, no description, just one word. Food - the food was good, but not \u00a320 a dish good. It was gastropub, \u00a312 - 15 good. For the premium you pay I'd expect better. The belly pork was tasty but in parts very dry. The pheasant portion was rather small. All in all, I'd probably go again on a special offer / TopTable, but not full price. There are plenty of cheaper and better places.",

Roasts and other classic English dishes, well made with quality ingredients which wouldn't be out of place in the stalls of the Borough Market below. My dining companion and I went for the three course \u00a326 \"Market menu\", which during our visit offered a selection of starters (such as tomato soup or potted salt beef), mains of duck, trout, pork and a vegetable tart, and a desert selction including potted fig and an apple pie with custard. Everything we sampled was well presented and fantastic tasting. The restaurant itself was quite full (although it was a Saturday night), but we were lucky enough to be given a window table, providing views overlooking the borough market and the other restaurants below. My only criticism of Roast would be the expensive wine list, a minimum of \u00a320 for a 500ml caraffe of wine, moving up to \u00a330 minimum for a bottle is pricey. Nevertheless, the South African 2008 Quando Sauvignon Blanc was very nice, and not a wine you usually see on menus. With a meal for 2 with wine coming to \u00a3100, it's not your typical pub roast, but recommended if you want to treat yourself.",

I have been to Roast a few times over the past couple of years and I came to the conclusion that I probably won't be returning. It's extremely expensive, but I usually don't mind paying for quality. I just get the feeling that I am being 'had' on a few things! The dining room is very tightly packed, especially on the tables for two down the sides of the mezzanine floor. My friend and I went there last week and were literally sitting on the same table as an extremely amorous couple next to us. It just wasn't pleasant for either party! The food is good - I have never had anything that wasn't jolly nice there. I have tried the goat curry, the various daily specials, fish, chicken, steak... and all have been really nice. What really annoys me about this place is the wine list. I know wine, and I know that 50 quid for a bottle of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (not even Cloudy Bay) is pushing it rather a lot. Also, the service could be better. I have never had the rude experience that other reviewers have had, but you are somehow made to feel that you are an imposition and there's not a great deal of warmth or attention in the delivery. So, I have come to the stunning realisation that there are plenty of very good restaurants in London that will feed me decent food, let me sit down without having to introduce myself to my fellow diners and will serve me a wine with a generous mark up, but that doesn't leave me feeling fleeced.",

    "text": "I happened to have been lucky enough while visiting London to have been randomly strolling through Borough Market on a cold Saturday, and looked up --- I saw what looked like a wonderful restaurant where we could sit and get warm over a few glasses of wine and some modern English cuisine.So, we asked some security personnel and market employees for directions on how to get upstairs and then made our way up in the elevator into a beautiful space with unfortunately, a very rude hostess. \u00a0The Roast hostess was clearly dismayed that we would dare enter such an establishment without a reservation and didn't even offer the suggestion to wait at the bar or to sit in the open seating in the lounge area. \u00a0She said, \"You can try coming back in 45 minutes.\" \u00a0She then answered the phone and we weren't able to get her attention again to ask if what we suspected was lounge seating was in fact open. \u00a0It turns out that it was - thanks to the assistance from another server we sat down.From then on the experience was wonderful. \u00a0Servers worked collectively and the Sommelier appeared promptly upon request and made several recommendations on wine and encouraged and offered us tasting prior to choosing.The food ranged from pickled herring and beets, to grouse, and lambs livers. \u00a0Since I'm American and wanted to try something \"British\" that I'd never had before I went with the herring and partridge. \u00a0The meat was a tad overdone but the saucier at Roast knows his/her stuff. \u00a0My BF had the lambs livers and his sauce was possibly the most exquisite sauce I've ever had. \u00a0It was layered in flavor and rich beyond belief. \u00a0My sauce was also perfectly balanced and enhanced both the partridge and the brussel sprouts served with the dish.Roast had a broad menu but I'd venture a guess that their true focus is in meat and game so if you're a veggie you should probably not bother and just get some curry downstairs. \u00a0This place is for serious diners and foodies.I'd recommend this restaurant to any locals who are into nouveau British cuisine, or out of town guests who would appreciate the experience like we did. \u00a0It was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.",

The roast menu includes very good fish, meat and bird - when the description warns of possible buck shot you can't help to think the pheasant is fresh! The menu reads like grandma's country estate but presentation is west side.All items come with sauce and sides so don't look here for plain dishes. With a sensitive palette you may be bothered by all the salt. However, we ate here after a week long holiday in Paris and welcomed simple meats prepared in a more comfortable style.Restaurant is also comfortable albeit with white table clothes, pressed linen and a sharp staff. Eat by the open kitchen and watch your food take shape, by the windows peering over a bustling market, or on the raised platform to be center of attention.",

It's \u00a375.....but it serves 2 people so only about \u00a335. It's worth it for a one off special occasion. Great views of London's shard.

    "text": "Roast is a hidden gem hanging above Borough Market and completely out of place with rough good natured hustle and bustle of the market itself. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing as it's a great respite from it all.As far as decor and food, I've give Roast 4 stars. The glazing on the windows completely blocks out the sounds of the market although the noise of the chatter inside is heavy enough to drown out a soft spoken work. The high windows and ceilings give it a very airy feel and on a sunny day it's almost like sitting outside.The food. I started off with sauteed scallops which were cooked perfectly, enough to lose the chill of a rare scallop but not too much where they become chewy. The fresh chives didn't add much to the flavour but the dry savoury nut (can't remember which nut it was) mousse added a great contrast to the inherent sweetness of the scallop.My main of pork belly with mashed potatoes and applesauce was overall quite good. Excellent mash without too much butter and the tart applesauce provided a good contrast to the sweet glaze used on the pork. The crackling was also excellently made. The meat itself was a bit of a let down, tender yes, but not as much flavour as I would expect from such a dish.Dessert was an acceptable chocolate tart but nothing to really write about.The things that knocked it down to 3 stars for me were i) the rude service, ii) the noise (hard to hold a conversation) and iii) poor table position (in the middle and away from the gorgeous views). Also, there was no one at the coat check when we left and we ended up making it self-service.Return Factor (credit to P. A. from Vegas for this concept): 70% especially as I have to try a namesake roast one Sunday",

We sat at a table against the window, getting a great view of the Borough Market. I ate my first and only traditional English breakfast, and have a feeling that this was a much fancier, and less heavy version than is commonly served. The food came quickly, and the bartender actually took notice of when we had finished, and we were able to pay very shortly after eating, which is much more than I can say about everywhere else we dined in London. I would totally recommend Roast, and eat there again on my next trip to London.",

The restaurant itself nests above Borough market and as we entered there was a lady at a piano singing contemporary music jazz style. All very pleasing. The atmosphere was lively. When we got to order we naturally went for a roast (I think everything on the menu was a roasted something or the other). The price of a main (\u00a330 to \u00a340) is a little steep regardless of the fact that the cow had been reared on golden syrup. However, when the food came it was delicious. It's like having a really posh Sunday roast dinner in the evening. Beef was cooked to perfection. The wine list is extensive (and expensive) but worth going for something good. All in all a great evening. I would highly recommend.",

See, we'd just done a 5k run for charity and because I chose the run in the City, everywhere was shut when we finished which meant no drinks for us. I always forget what a wasteland that area turns into on a Sunday. Which meant the only place open nearby (it was only just 12). Roast was it. We only wanted drinks, and they perched us at the bar with our soggy running stuff and little medals. Then we drank our way through the cocktail menu. Every single cocktail I tried was excellent. The star of the afternoon was a strawberry bellini thing which had a heck of a lot of vodka in it. Their cocktails are inventive and the bar staff a really friendly. The downside? It's VERY expensive. Cocktails are around the \u00a310-11 mark, and I know it's fancy, but my friend got 15p change after buying a beer and a COKE. There needs to be something very special about a beer that costs six quid, (and the staff need to learn how to pour something that's been bottle conditioned). But, then I remember how yummy the cocktails were, and how friendly they were given that we looked a bedraggled mess, so it's four stars from me even though we didn't have anything to eat. I can't afford to come here often, and I think the bar feels more like a waiting area for the restaurant, but a very fun time was had by all.",

    "text": "I saw Andrew Zimmern go to ROAST on an episode of \"Bizarre Food\" once and made a mental note to go there the next time I was in London. I love British food, which is probably odd for a Thai person, but mark it up to nostalgia for my youth spent mostly in England. The opportunity came in August 2010 when I had to go to the UK for a friend's wedding. Booked a table ahead of time. I loved the concept of the changing menus and seasonal ingredients etc. It was definitely a high end restaurant and the people on the tables near us looked like they could have been some politicians or VIPs. We got a very nice table by the big windows that over looked a couple of pubs below so we got to do a lot of people watching as many of them were standing drinking outside on the streets .... it was warm in August and they were probably the smokers.The menu choice du jour was all mouth watering but we all had to make a decision in the end. (see photos) I loved everything that I got. The only complaint probably was how expensive it all was; even though I didn't pay for the meal myself! And a little bit on the pretentious / snooty side. \u00a0I do love gourmet and haute cuisine from time to time but if I have to break the bank to have it then I can certainly live without it. I think it is certainly possible to make very fine food at a reasonable price.Final verdict: Although I was very happy with the meal overall, I thought it was overpriced and a bit pretentious. It was great to get to try it once but I probably won't bother going back. Unless someone with very deep pockets wants to take me .... anyone? Just kidding.",

My friend usually has the porridge, which she says is really good. I, on the other hand, prefer something a bit more substantial for breakfast and alternate between the full english (Full Borough I think they call it) and the 'to-die-for' caramelised bananas with french bread and bacon. Simply perfect.The dinner and lunch services are very good too, quintessential British food at its finest. Their steaks are really good, and they cook all the food very well. The waiting staff are very polite and helpful, happy to accommodate any needs. What I would say is that if you have a vegetarian with you, this might not be the best place to go as it is very meat-orientated.N.B.: When calling to make a reservation, ask for a window seat. That way you can enjoy your meal looking out across St Paul's Cathedral and the amazing views of London.",

The room is still spectacular with great views over the market and St Paul, especially on a bright, sunny day like today. The service is still very professional, if somewhat codified. However the food was simply poor. Our starter called a lamb salad turned out to be deep fried lamb with a few salad leaves. The dish was very greasy and the lamb was more fat than meat with little taste. The main course used to be a great dish due to the quality of the beef. This time the burger was so salty you could not taste anything. I hope for Roast this was a one off. If not, avoid at all cost.",

We started with the celery and blue soup, not sure what to expect but OMG it was fantastic hot warm creamy soup with walnuts and blue cheese gosh it was perfect . Then my husband and I \u00a0(honeymoon) had the chateaubriand for two with a side of glazed carrots and added two sauces on the side bone marrow and bernaise. The meat was cooked medium to perfection \u00a0( this dish is a timed dish 40 mins wait) it was worth the wait. \u00a0The little roasted potatoes were wonderful the sauces were on point but best of all it came with the best Yorkshire pudding I've ever had fill the hole of it with the most delicious gravy from the pan dripping we ordered more of the gravy too yum, the carrots were awesome as well.

Luckily there was a table available even though the place was packed. We really just wanted coffee so we ordered a French press, but we felt too guilty to take up a table in this fancy place without having any food. My parents shared the fish and chips, which was probably the most expensive fish and chips that I've ever laid eyes on. Unfortunately the fish was a bit bland and could have used a bit more salt. But not dry at all and great batter. My charcuterie plate was lovely, absolutely no complaints. I also got the Orange Bombshell which consists of \"Roast gin, Mandarin Napoleon liqueur, Kamm and Son's ginseng liqueur, Grand Marnier, lemon curd, and orange juice shaken and served on a frozen orange.\" It was a delicious drink, but the presentation seemed a little.. juvenile? The description does mention that it comes in a frozen orange, but a small plate or shallow cup would have been nice as the orange kept staining the table.As others have mentioned, it's expensive but the service was great and you get a nice view over the market.",

    "text": "I can't remember the last time I had a good Sunday roast. Sundays for me now consist of curries or Thai or hungover Dominos but you can't beat a nice big roast with all the trimmings.I was recently given a voucher so I could go & enjoy dinner at Roast in Borough Market. They very kindly agreed to let me swap my dinner reservation for a Sunday lunch time booking so I could make the most of their three courses for \u00a337.50 deal. Roast serves great British food from their glass-windowed restaurant located in the middle of Borough Market. It's owned by Iqbal Wahhab, the founder of Cinnamon Club and it's a famed for its use of seasonal produce. We decided to kick our meal off with some fancy looking cocktails. Tom went for the Mango Tarragon Martini (\u00a312) made with Roast gin infused with fresh tarragon, fresh mango puree and elderflower cordial. Lovely and fruity and very strong. I went for the SE1 spICED tea (\u00a312) an even stronger blend of gin, bourbon, citrus infused vodka, rum, cointreau and sugar, topped with ginger ale. Despite containing half the contents of the bar, it's surprisingly refreshing and the perfect way to start out off meal. I started off our three courses with the pork and black pudding scotch egg served with piccalilli which was incredible. The egg was perfectly cooked so the yolk was still runny and ran into the crisp meaty casing. I felt the piccalilli was a little over-powering so I recommend using it sparingly. \u00a0Tom went for the pressed wild rabbit and ham hock terrine which came with fig chutney and toasted sour-dough. Not quite to my taste but Tom really enjoyed it. The main courses were where Roast really lived up to its name. The roast pork belly came with the biggest piece of crackling I've ever seen. The meat was perfectly cooked and had that rich, melt-in-the-mouth quality - not too fatty but still packed with flavour. \u00a0 Lamb is Tom's favourite so he went for the rosemary and garlic studded leg of lamb with redcurrant jelly and mint sauce. Perfectly tender and served with an extra-large yorkshire pudding. Roast really know how to spoil you with the extras!All the roasts come with a selection of beef dripping roasties, seasonal green veg and carrots. If you're anything like me - order an extra round of gravy which the staff are more than happy to bring out.After all that food we had to activate our second 'dessert stomachs' so we could squeeze in room for pudding. Tom went for a piping hot Bramley apple crumble served with the creamiest vanilla custard while I predictably went for the sticky date pudding with toffee sauce and clotted cream. (They can call it sticky date pudding all they want, it will always be Sticky Toffee)The three-course Sunday lunch is brilliant value but the alcohol doesn't come cheap. The cheapest bottle of wine is around \u00a340 and they increase steadily from there so the bill can rack up pretty quickly!Roast would make a really lovely spot if you're heading out for a celebration. It'a a little pricey so while it's probably not somewhere I would come every weekend, I would definitely recommend it for a birthday or an occasional treat.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to visit when I'm in London. Situated above Borough Market, it's a true farm-to-table experience, with many vendors from the market supplying meat and produce.Reservations are needed for the better tables with a view, but you can on occasion walk in and snag a table. On a recent visit we had the lobster with tandoori spices and hamburger. Both were to die for!My only regret is I didn't pick up a cookbook, and they aren't released on Amazon until September.",

We got seated towards the back since we had a toddler. At least we were close to the kitchen where we could check them out. I know a few of us ordered fish and chips and I can't even remember what I ordered. Might've been some sort of poultry. I have to give them a thumbs up for their service. There was a waitress that totally took a liking to my toddler and really made him feel special. There was also a musician that night and the kid was swaying to the music. The ladies at the front also gave him a balloon while we were leaving. While the food might not have been so memorable, their service definitely stood out.",

After perusing the menu, we ordered pork belly, chicken and mushrooms.The pork belly comes with apple sauce and I normally don't like anything sweet with meat. So they accommodated my request to bring the apple sauce on the side. The chicken and mushrooms dishes were good. Pork belly comes with a side of mashed potatoes and was really delicious!The portion size was big, so couldn't finish the entire dish. Didn't even have space for dessert.Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Coyly situated upstairs in the Borough Market area, this place is really where you want to go for modern British cuisine and excellent service. High ceilings and flooding light from the surrounding window panes makes for a gorgeous space. Very simple, white, spacious with a fantastic bar (an important criteria).We came in here on a Saturday around 7:30pm and I was surprised at how unpretentious they were about seating, considering that Roast is quite up-scale and popular. Was impressed that it was good old clean classy. The staff was extremely polite and attentive. The sommelier's patience was impressive as we asked him for a recommendation all having ordered very different mains. He was very professional and knowledgeable as were the other staff members, recommending appetizers to complement our entrees. Being cursed/blessed with a reasonably sized sweet-tooth, I opted for entree and dessert rather than appetizer and entree. The menu was problematic in the best way. Everything sounded fantastic and well thought-out. After a good 10 minutes of back and forth I settled on the roast rump of Launceston lamb with crispy potato and ramson cake. I thought the potato was fine but could have had a little more flavor or crunch but the pea shoots complemented it nicely, though there was just not enough of it for me The portions were a bit inconsistent in terms of size as the people around me had huge mounds of mash with their pork belly while the person across from me had meagre amount of side. However, the lamb was delectable, well cooked and tender, and served with an acidic salsa which cut through the dish expertly. And the dessert. Requires a separate paragraph. Amazing. The goats cheese cheesecake was just the most fantastic thing. Not being a fan of anything too sweet or heavy, this was perfect for me. The usually hardened crust was transformed into almost a coating on a subtly sweet creamy delight of cheesecake goodness. Accompanying it was a lovely poached strawberry sauce, allowing you to add your desired amount of sweetness. Perfection.The negatives are few. One, it took a while to get our bill and we were given the wrong menus a couple of times. Also, if you are faced the open oven/kitchen area rather than the other side, then it isn't a very pretty dining experience. It was loud in general volume and the portion sizes were off as I would not have been full had it not been for us ordering extra sides to an already pricey bill. The wines are expensive, though understandably so.Most certainly on my list of best retaurants. I will be back to try the tempting Wellington and the Roast Goosnargh duck with star anise infused whipped cauliflower and sour cherry sauce!",

They do a three course menu at lunch for 30\u00a3 (started, main course and dessert). I ordered the watermelon, mozzarella and tomato salad as the starter. It was good - refreshing and light. I went for the fish as the main course, which was delicately cooked and not over cooked! Hooray. Over cooked fish is the worst! Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the apple and raspberry crumble with vanilla custard. So yum! For an additional 5\u00a3, you can add a glass of prosecco. We did and it was worth it. Roast is also surprisingly kid friendly. They have change tables in the bathroom (women's only ) and high chairs. Kids eat free in school holidays!",

The roast I had in fact was quite good, despite the limited dinner menu on a Sunday night and then fact that lot of items were sold out.The sirloin roast I had was cook medium rare, just right for me and the cut was nice.The entire however was only alright with the poached salmon, slightly on he bland side and the veg didn't mix as well as I'd like.Dessert I had the white chocolate pudding and it was really good. The only thing that was odd was the peach source that didn't go very well.All in all the food there were lots to like, however everything was just 1 star shy of perfection. Overall deserves a solid 4 star.Now, why did I put a 3 star down if they deserve a solid 4 star then? It comes down to the fact that, they forced us to have last order at 6:30pm, when our booking was at 6:15pm. The rush was unnecessary and I personally think if that was the case it should have been clearly communicated st the booking!",

The beef itself is tender and yummy but the pudding could be a bit over roasted. Would be better if more generous about the gravy.

    "text": "My friends and I went here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. Considering the price point and elegant, crisp interior with high ceilings and good views of BM, I'd love to give this place more stars but the lackluster service, some misses on the food and high price point prevents me from doing so. I have to give them points for a very creative vegetarian menu as well. The salad with cranberries was delicious and a decent-sized portion, and the truffle and burrata tortellini was rich but I think could have used a bit more truffle and the cheese seemed to be a ricotta more than burrata. The desserts though were fantastic. The chocolate peanut butter was sinfully rich and tasty as opposed to the much lighter strawberry panna cotta. The sticky toffee pudding was on point. My husband and dining companions enjoyed their meaty meals as well but no one raved about the food. The hitch here was the service. When I'm paying this much I expect to have more attentive waiters like I do in NY. We kept on having to ask the waiter (when he decided to show up every so often), to refill our water glasses even though I told him to just bring a jug. He never asked us how our food was, did we want anything else to drink, etc. I know service stinks in the U.K. compared to the US and this just exemplified it. Also at the end of the meal, our table was offered a toffee sponge dessert. It was pretty bland but our table agreed if we were going to be offered a dessert anyway we wouldn't have spent money on the aforementioned desserts. Overall, lovely interior but won't be returning.",

    "text": "Mr. Snarky happened to be working in London so I suggested we go for a nice dinner because let's be honest... when we're at home over the weekend, the last thing we think about is recreating my daily commute to go for a meal. \u00a0I saw Roast as I was on a Harry Potter walking tour ( part of the job!) and thought we should give it a go. \u00a0You can make reservations online, so that is handy when you are taking care of life admin during your lunch break!I had trouble finding the place as I forgot that it is upstairs! \u00a0Fortunately I had seen Mr. Snarky standing outside. \u00a0There is a lift, or you can take the stairs and at the top you'll be greeted by a host. \u00a0The place is massive and it was much louder than I anticipated. \u00a0In fact, the bar was really buzzing while there were a lot of empty tables. \u00a0Our waiter was, as Mr. Snarky says, a 'misery guts'. \u00a0He genuinely just didn't seem interested, which is a bit sad because one of the other waiters who delivered some of our food was really delightful.I decided to have an Earl Grey cocktail as well as the onion, leek, and garlic soup while Mr. Snarky went with the Scotch Egg. \u00a0The starters were nice, but I guess there was nothing that special about them. \u00a0To be honest, the starters reminded me of a nice country gastropub... which isn't a bad thing, but the prices led us to believe that these dishes should be really special. \u00a0As we were sitting there discussing the food... Mr. Snarky made a comment about the music in the background... \u00a0but actually I didn't even realise there was background music until there was a song where you could hear some bass line that cut through the chatter and conversations happening throughout the restaurant.We also noticed that there were a lot of children about... including a birthday celebration. \u00a0We thought that it is a bit expensive to bring children, but it turns out that children eat free during school holidays. \u00a0Now that is a good deal and a great way to get people through the doors.I talked Mr. Snarky into the Chateaubriand for two. \u00a0I'd seen it on the menu at a couple of places we have been to and I told him that I really wanted to try it. \u00a0Actually it wasn't that difficult because he was looking at the roast beef and it comes with the same trimmings, so why not. \u00a0We also added a side of Winter Greens with Broccoli because other than the potatoes, it doesn't come with veg. \u00a0You know when you are at a restaurant and you see a dish being delivered to a table and everyone is looking because they are wondering what it is so they can order it... that was us ;). \u00a0In fact, we thought we had ordered too much food to begin with because the plates kept coming out. \u00a0Hands down, the star of the show was the meat. \u00a0It was delicious, it was tender, it was juicy. \u00a0With a name like roast... the meat has to be spot on. \u00a0The roast potatoes were nice, but could have been a bit crispier. \u00a0The Yorkshires were crispier than the potatoes, but the horseradish sauce and the red wine gravy were really delicious... and I don't like horseradish. \u00a0So we got our bowl of greens and I should have realised that the sides are all portions for one. \u00a0We thought about ordering another bowl, especially as there was only one piece of broccoli in the bowl, but actually we felt fairly full... \u00a0not overly full, but a satisfied full.We had a look at the dessert menu and actually there was only one item on the dessert menu that Mr. Snarky would have eaten as everything else had things that he didn't like... for example nuts... \u00a0if you have a nut allergy you may struggle with the dessert menu. \u00a0And he didn't seem that interested, so we gave dessert a miss. \u00a0The meat was spectacular, but everything else was a bit average... \u00a0and if they were charging the same price as the nice country gastropub, it would probably get a higher rating, but at over \u00a3100, we expected something a bit more special.",

    "text": "I think I'd give this place a solid 4 stars. It's upscale dining but not fine dining and the price does reflect that (meaning on the more expensive side but not atrocious). If you can, I'd suggest going when they have their \u00a330 set menu (appetizer, main, and dessert) - check online to see what times that is available as it is not available for all of dinner time. If not, you'll pay \u00a325+ for a main + \u00a37+ for dessert with an additional vat/service charge. Portion sizes are larger than typical London style though so again, the price isn't unreasonable when you think about it. I'd highly recommend their sticky toffee pudding - absolutely delicious! Their beef roast wasn't as bad as most reviewers make it out to be and their roasted potatoes are quite good with a nice crunchy shell but soft inside (apparently fried in duck fat?). Their pork belly is also quite good but as with all pork belly cuts, can be a little fatty. The view is nice as well if you're by the windows or under the glass roof. All in all, I'd say this is a good place for a nice splurge dinner/date.",

My boyfriend got the lamb meatball and it literally tasted like ground beef. The entrees were a little better. After the entrees were cleared, my boyfriend waited to order a beer, got it, finished it and proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for our desserts to finally appear. His order was wrong. We waited 40 minutes after our plates were clear for our dessert. Our food had settled by then and we barely ate the desserts. Service and water are an extra charge at this restaurant. Unless you're drinking and continuously racking up your bill. They completely ignore you and don't check up on you. If you want Sunday lunch, I'd suggest you go elsewhere.",

Four of us dined tougher and we had the same underwhelming experience. Disappointing. General tip for Americans traveling to England: I don't enjoy eating spicy food but favorful food is a must! The entire time I was traveling in London I wished I'd brought Lawry's seasoning salt across the pond.

    "text": "It's a great location, right in the heart of London in the ancient Borough Market and a walking distance to a lot of London's famous landmarks. The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about, just a big open landscape with an ugly bar in the center and tables scattered around without any particular plan. The noise level is literally deafening and if you want to have a conversation with your dinner party you're gonna need a pretty powerful set of vocal chords and a brain that is able to process the messages sent to you and discern them from the mighty roar surrounding you. Apparently if you visit any of the neighboring pubs and consume manly quantities of alcohol before you come to Roast for your dinner, that might help. Or at least, that's what the locals obviously do, judging from their behavior and the level of their voices.I had a suckling pig as my main course and that was - to express myself kindly - terrible. Rather than meat what I got consisted of pork shavings and crumbs obviously reheated and hardened in the process. This was swimming in an ugly-looking and foul tasting gravy and covered by a big blanket of caramellized pork skin, basically black in color.After the highly disappointing dinner which left a strange aftertaste in my mouth and stunned by all the shouting around me (some of the shouters less than three feet away) I thought I would ask for something sweet to at least have some good experience. After all, how wrong can you be about a cake or a pie. I ordered a date pudding with ice-cream topping and my was I in for yet another disappointment! The dry brown mass had a taste that you just could not define (beside the fact that it was nowhere near the dates) and the ice-cream topping turned out to be a lump of plain butter (WTF !?).Wow!On top of it all came the price! A glass of mediocre Malbec goes for 15 pounds!The service is highly efficient, fast and no-nonsense. To be fast and efficient, they have also eliminated courtesy and any other service element beyond the minimum necessary to execute the basic transactions.So, if you want my advice, there's plenty of restaurants in the area, go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Apparently the British love beef, particularly for lunch on a Sunday. As I love beef, and brunch.. eating Sunday Roast in London was on our to do list during our visit. We wanted to try 'Roast' (what better place for Sunday Roast than a restaurant that's named \"Roast) after seeing it featured on the Food Network. It is located above Borough Market, and you have to take an elevator up. The restaurant is contemporary and spacious - it felt upscale and polished. Our group made reservations for 11:30am a week in advance for a table of 3 and were seated promptly when we arrived. However, once the server came by, we were told, rather rudely, that lunch isn't served until noon and to just come back in 30 minutes. We weren't sure what to do, so we kind of just sat there for 30 minutes while no one checked up on us. It was rather difficult to get someone's attention, but once someone came by around noon to take our orders, all the three of us decided to go for their Saturday special Beef Wellington, a bottle of champagne, and Yorkshire pudding as a side.The Beef Wellington Special was a whole fillet of beef covered in pastry accompanied by three large roast potatoes. They never asked how we wanted the meat cooked, so the beef was tougher than what I would've liked. However, the roast potatoes were great, and the Yorkshire pudding was light, which I used to mop up the juices of the meat. At these prices (\u00a325-30 per entr\u00e9e) for Sunday Roast, I'd expect to be getting superior service and food. However, service was erratic and not friendly - the waiters had no interest in what they were serving or what we wanted. Food is only average - nothing to rave about. Unfortunately the bill automatically included a 12.5% Service charge. Will be looking for Sunday Roast elsewhere the next time I'm in town.",

Not really familiar with London, I was wonderfully surprised that Roast was right there in the Burroughs Market. C'mon, a restaurant in the London mecca of from farm to table and local sustainability? I was in for a treat.On Sundays, its a 3 course pre fixe menu. Everything sounded outstanding so future visits are noted. But tonight it was seared duck breast, sirloin roast w/Yorkshire pudding and gravy, accompanied by a big bowl of kale and cabbage, another big bowl of seasoned carrots, and a third big bowl of perfectly roasted potatoes. Dessert was Bramely apple tart crisp with cream sauce.Everything was delicious but the stars was the sliced sirloin and potatoes. Portions were more than generous and at 37 British pounds, I'd say this meal was a steal.",

    "text": "Roast. Roast and more Roast. They've sure got the name right. If there was one word I would use to describe the type of cuisine on offer it would be 'Roast'. It was a friend's birthday last night and for a (yet another) special treat, we went to the restaurant above Borough Market in London Bridge, famous for its (you guessed it) roast meats and rich accompaniments. This is not one to visit if you are trying to eat healthily or on a budget. It's indulgence in all sorts of ways. The restaurant is beautiful; it was stylishly lit and with a stunning semi-circular window (the retained portico of an old flower market); there was an open kitchen where you could see the kitchen staff plating up salads and sauces (my friend did ask if one of them was the headchef to which we all replied, no dear, he/she will be doing much more important things in the back); a vault for expensive wine and a swish shiny bar cutting off the casual area with a live piano from the bistro style restaurant. The meat was delicious, especially the steak, which unsurprisingly enough was the most expensive thing on the menu. It was cooked medium and presented stylishly on a wooden board with a novelty miniature pan of peppercorn sauce. I didn't order it so cannot give a full account. All I was allowed was a tiny slither. Look at the photo to the left though and you can make up your own mind. It looked pretty damn good to me. Instead I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was great, but didn't leave me speechless. The meat was pink and soft and the sauce was rich and winey, but the pastry wasn't crispy enough and the mushroom pate was a little overpowering. It was also meant to come with braised red cabbage which was another reason why I ordered it, but the restaurant had run out, very unimpressive considering the \u00a328 price tag. I was offered root mash as an alternative which I accepted a bit grumpily only to find that the sidedish was left off our order when the rest of the food was bought out. The other side dishes were pleasing, especially the sprouts with bacon and stuffing, a true taste of Christmas. The wine was delicious, but it was \u00a317 and all we got was a 500ml carafe. I would happily have paid that for a full bottle, but two-thirds? A bit much. The waitress was friendly and did some good selling. She uptalked all of the specials and tried her very hardest to get us to buy doubles of everything. On both cases she didn't persuade us: it \u00a39 per G&T. One was more than enough. Overall the service was a little slow. Our table was constantly being buzzed around by waiters, waitresses and bar men but for all the show of being busy, not a lot of waitering happened. For this sort of money I expected a quicker and more responsive service. Though they recovered some points when we told them it was one of our parties birthdays and a plate of ice cream with a candle, a homemade brandy snap and 'happy birthday Kate' written in chocolate sauce turned up. Now to the entertainment. In the bar area was a singer with accompanying pianist. She played some great, cheesey tunes (a lot of Aleisha Keys, Mariah Carey) and had a fantastic voice but she was a little overwhelming. Everyone had a little giggle when she started the first chorus of Empire State of Mind and at 'New York' (not Newport..), a third of the restaurant (mostly those under 30) started to sing along. But the over-loud volume did get in the way of us having a deep and meaningful over dinner. Overall, I had an ace experience and I went home very full and fairly satisfied. My final issue with Roast is that whilst stuffing myself with great produce I easily forgot where I was. I was sitting and eating above one of the most iconic food markets in the country. Why wasn't I being reminded of it? It wasn't mentioned in any of the menus, there were no pictures on the wall, it was a real undersell of the resources right on their doorstep. If it was my restaurant, I would have been buying the beef from the beef stall in the market, the wine from the wine stall in the market, the..you, get the picture. Maybe they did? They just didn't bother to let the patrons know.",

    "text": "I had a pleasant meal at Roast eating from their set menu, or Market menu. It was \u00a328 for 3 courses and there were three or four choices on each one with a veggie option available. To have the Market menu on a Saturday evening we had to arrive between 6 and 6.30. When we arrived we were informed that we would need to have finished by 8.45 in order to make the table available for the next seating. We were happy with that so it was little surprising that the waiting staff took 45 minutes to take our order and that they got a little surly when we asked if they were going to take it. Bearing in mind that the restaurant was only about half full at this point. The meal was generally very nice. Little rabbit burgers in toast were tasty and juicy with a tangy, sweet and sticky apple sauce. Then the slow roast belly of pork was succulent and delicious though it's crackling was more chewy than crisp which seems a crying shame. It came with a generous serving of buttery creamy mash so there was no need to order extra side dishes which we had already done - crunchy goose fat roast potatoes which were perfectly cooked though slightly lacking in seasoning. Finally I had the cheese for dessert which was some cheddar and biscuits. It wasn't the most remarkable cheddar I've ever eaten but it was fine. The members of my party that had the raspberry cheesecake and the rhubarb fool though were very pleased. All in all, I would say Roast provides quite nice (not amazing) food in a swanky setting for a fairly reasonable price, so long as you stick to their Market menu. Beyond that, and when you look to the wine list, it gets very expensive very quickly...but maybe it gets amazing too! The main area for improvement based on my experience is their serving - not leaving people too long and always being friendly.",

    "text": "Love the venue, the cocktails and the lunch/evening menu. However, this place can not cook an egg for breakfast. I've been here twice for breakfast meet-ups as it's such a great location for people working south of the river. The brunch menu is a little uninspiring though and, I have to mention it again, there make bad eggs! The first time my omlette was still clucking, on trying fried eggs for my next visit they were bizarrely chewy with something brown and burnt looking on the base. Veggies are well catered for in the daytime menu but, as is often the case, doesn't provide great value for money. I hardly ever do this but I sent my breakfast bill back to the waiter. After requesting no bacon, I was provided with a big empty plate on which sat in the middle a sad looking tattie scone, two [as we've established, awful] eggs and one tiny little mushroom. I figured they must've miscalculated the cost at \u00a38.50 as if I'd walked across the road to a Borough High St caff I could've had a 3 egg omlette, bacon, chips, beans, toast, hash browns, mushrooms and about 10 cups of tea. They're famous for their breakfasts here but I so, so wish the quality would improve as I do like it here the rest of the time.",

In terms of cuisine, probably not a good place for vegetarians. \u00a0There were some veggie options, but it was quite meat-heavy. \u00a0In a good way though for us omnivores! \u00a0I was feeling like a light meal \u00a0so I opted for one of their fish dishes. \u00a0I always have some hesitations ordering fish at a place that specializes in proper meat dishes, but I was not disappointed by any means this time 'round. \u00a0I opted for the cornish grilled mackerel served with gooseberries, elderflower (elderberries?) and corn salad - for about \u00a315 which though not cheap for my exchange-rate impacted american currency standards, was totally reasonably for the quality and flavour. \u00a0Also, I got to try some things I'd never had before. \u00a0I was expecting the corn salad to be of the yellow kernel variety but apparently its more of a leafy, slightly bitter but delicious vegetable - and apparently the plant itself is called corn salad?! \u00a0anyway, I enjoyed it. \u00a0Also, while I've been seeing more and more elderflower flavoured drinks around, I had never had it in its pure form before - and I think it may have been the berries? \u00a0Anyway, there as a good mix of the elderflower and gooseberries (which I'd previously only had as jam) and it was a quite delectable complement to the mackerel. \u00a0Next time 'round I may opt for the cornish hake or go for a less healthy and maybe call ahead (24hrs notice) for the Roast rib of Welsh Black beef with Yorkshire pudding, creamed horseradish and mustard. \u00a0mmm...I wonder if they have any openings for tomorrow? :)",

The menu here is great, as long as you are a meat lover and not afraid of a few terms such as \"bone marrow\"! I had scotch egg for starter with Picalilly, may sound a bit dull but it was delicious. For main I opted for the famous pork belly with mash and apple sauce. The piece of pork was enormous but delicious, the crackling was perfectly crisp and the meat tender. Perfect. I was too full for dessert which was dissapointing as they have a great cheese menu, sourced from Neils Yard but I did manage a glass of port, it was Xmas afterall. Great, friendly service, great atmosphere and great food. A bit pricey so not a restaurant for regular dining but great for a treat!",

I have never felt rich enough to try, expecially when the fish place in the market does lovely fish and chips for less than half that on a Friday....Maybe I will get a win on the lottery and I will go eat their lunch and let you know :-)If you want a nice brekkie though, def try this place",

With every choice of roast possible, I opted for the roast beef after debating it over with the pork. I did cheekily ask the waiter if I could have a tiny slice of pork with my beef to settle both cravings and to my surprise he delivered. The beef was lovely but perhaps a little too much sinew for my liking and the pork was just perfect and I had meal envy right there on my own plate. Opting for the two courses for 26 quid, (yes, it's a fancy roast place) we all chose a main meal and a dessert. After spotting a Knickerbocker Glory that a kid was having on an opposite table, a few of us decided that we must have that for dessert and while not appearing on our menus, the waiter handed over the Young Diner's menu where Knickerbocker Glory featured. Ahh, there is no shame ordering from a children's menu when ordering in numbers, is there? It was mighty tasty and a fine afternoon.",

Which is pretty much the view I took away from a long and lazy Sunday lunch over a highly quaffable red. Despite, essentially, being located by a decaying train bridge, Roast makes the most of its space and is light and airy, feeling both open and intimate at the same time - never an easy trick to pull off. The Sunday lunch option was a three course set menu for \u00a320 (or two for \u00a326) with a decent variety and vegetarian options as well. The starts were nice without ever hitting spectacular notes, although the trout was brilliantly fresh. Potted pickled herring was tasty, although I could have happily munched on just the soda bread and super-creamy butter. But the proof, for a place like Roast, is in the mains and they didn't disappoint. Half a chicken was beautifully tender while roast beef was medium rare and absolutely perfect. I'd have liked some wholegrain mustard to go with it as opposed to Coleman's, but that's a minor gripe. The apple and rhubarb crumble to finish was sublime, although the bakewell didn't quite live up to its name. Throw in an impressive wine list and friendly and efficient service and Roast definitely justifies the price. There were lots of families when we visit on Sunday lunch and this place is suitable for all sorts if you want a blow out. The food is delicious yet won't scare off non-foodies. Dates, parent birthdays or a celebration - Roast has them all cooked.",

Otherwise, the pork belly is always a fine choice and the daily special has never let me down - a recent visit delivered the single best piece of beef I've ever eaten - but if you can get organised order the day before and have the rib. The burger - Saturday brunch and on the bar menu - is also dazzling. I've not tried the Hawksmoor version yet but it's got to go some to knock this burger off the best in London perch. Happily this isn't a place to rest on its laurels. They've introduced a new own blend wine from Chapel Down which is not just the best English wine I've ever had, it's one I'm convinced will throw even vociferous Aussies in a blind tasting.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was all high quality and well cooked, the liver and bacon steak particularly stood out but everything was good.Dessert was apple crumble with custard. I'm a crumble man and this gets 7.5/10 in my crumble charts, so good but not exceptional.Overall a four star rating but if I'd reviewed based on my previous memories rather than on last Tuesday's dinner it would be five.",

However it's noisy and it was difficult to hold a conversation with the person across the table. The food was good, but nothing special, and very expensive. The best part of the meal was the starter. I had the sea trout which was amazing, but came with only 4 capers which was a bit mean. I also tried the haggis scotch egg which is the best I have ever tasted. Then I had the roast sirloin of beef which was overlooked. I had asked for rare. There was too little gravy and the roast potatoes were hard and dry. The large Yorkshire pudding looked promising, but was again disappointingly arid. Certainly not worth the \u00a335 price tag. I had the apple crumble. The apples were very tart and there was not enough fruit juices. There had been an attempt to cover this up by the liberal application of sugar. Not a good combination.The whole dish was overpowered by a very dry crumble and not enough custard. Not a great meal, although good in parts.",

    "text": "I didn't have the opportunity to dine in at Roast but was able to try some goodies off the menu at the Borough market Roast booth while I was visiting in London! The roast beef sandwich with the creamy horseradish sauce was one of my favorite bites during my week stay in London! Sometimes I believe the simplest foods are the tastiest! The chef carving the meats also let me have a sample of the pork belly which was cooked perfectly. All the meats were freshly carved, flavorful and crispy on the outside!",

    "text": "I was very much looking forward to an early Saturday evening meal at Roast. We had booked a table for two roughly a month in advance and so were very surprised when after sitting down at our table the first thing the hostess told us was that we had two hours in which to finish. No apologies, no explanation and the restaurant was barely half full. Not a good way to start the evening.I started with the scallops which were tasty, but only just lukewarm. My friend had the baked crab which was distinctly uninspiring with no thought given to the entirety of the dish or to presentation. Our side orders were cold and for somewhere that names itself Roast you would not expect roast chicken to come dry and with soggy skin. The pork belly was the one saving grace.The service was lacklustre, save for the topping-up of our wine, and we asked twice for bread which never arrived.We were so disappointed that we did not bother with dessert or coffee.There are many other places in London which have better food, better service and considerably better prices. At \u00a3112 for starters, main courses and a mid-range bottle of wine it should be so much more.",

    "text": "Based in the food lovers' homeland of Borough Market, Roast is constructed on the site of Britain's oldest surviving food market, just by London Bridge. The building has been given frontage in the form of the portico of the old Covent Garden flower market, this is how I discovered it and decided to make my way up to the first floor. There it awaits you a fabulous view onto the market on one side and over onto St. Paul's Cathedral on the other.I happened to go there on a Saturday afternoon after visiting the market. It would be a shame going to the restaurant to eat before trying all the delicatessen, which are offered and displayed at the market. When you get tiered of walking around, a light meal and wine gets appropriate.If you aim to have lunch or dinner at roast, I suggest you have a reservation. It is a little bit stiff and formal and asking for a small menu for in between they seated us in the bar area as the main restaurant was closed. Understandable that the staffs needs a break but it took ages until the waiters got our attention. They were busier talking to each other.Roast serves traditional British food offering a large spit oven in which free range chickens, suckling pigs, birds and ribs of beef are among the rotating roasted offerings each day. The restaurant is also open for breakfast if want to go somewhere special.Overall I think it was a nice place just because of the stunning location, even though it is a little bit overpriced I might not resist to sit in the portico next time.",

I've had both breakfast and lunch, always on Friday or Saturday when the market is busiest.It's worth booking well in advance for a table overlooking the market, the small coffee/drinks area has a good view, but rarely any spare seats.The food is generally ok, but somehow the venue adds to the experience. Had a very late breakfast once when obviously the chef was concentrating on lunch, they did put it all right in the end but dissapointing. but I'll be going again.",

    "text": "Went there yesterday with Andrew and the gang for a breakfast meeting. I hardely ever have been to such a nice location before in London. This may be a cultural thing. Many places that are hyped in London are windowless, crowded things. Not so here: Located literally above Borough Market, large windows give view to the old buildings opposite, some sky and also the trains to and from London bridge. I hardly remember enjoying a London location more. Everyone had some really English breakfast: Eggs with Marmite, Roasted Tomatoes or Porridge. Everyone loved it.The Latte Macchiato came in a perfact glass in a perfectly like out of the book. In our case, the service was good and friendly.I could have stayed here much longer and declare Roast to be one of my favourite places in London.",

    "text": "Without a doubt, a really fantastic space. They haven't compromised on trying to squeeze more people in here - the tables are well spaced and absolutely huge, so much so you might have to speak up to make yourself heard across them! In conjunction with the lofty roof, it gives the place a grand, classical elegance, and of course, the price of everything is adjusted to match. Still, I did enjoy my boiled eggs and soldiers, although the bread is cut far too thickly to fit into an egg. Maybe an ostrich egg would have been a better match. The full English is priced somewhere between astronomic and ridiculous, and I wasn't hungry at 0745 anyway, so we didn't try it. But, perhaps next time. If you're struggling to find the entrance - note well - it's inside the market under cover, and the place is above you!",

    "text": "I heard very mixed reviews about this place before I went and now that I have been, I can understand why. I ate there for the first time with a few colleagues and clients just a few weeks ago - once we had found the well-hidden entrance that is. Bizarrely, one member of the group picked up her G&T from the bar before we were seated and the bottom of the glass just slipped off, spilling the contents all over us. Weird. However, the staff had seen it happen and were so apologetic they gave us the round of drinks for free. The food is basically posh roast dinners and a few other alternatives. Not a vast amount of choice, but just enough to please almost everyone. I had the special which was a rather tasty roast beef dish. Just good, though. Not amazing. We ordered a variety of the vegetable dishes to share and there was more than enough to go around. The waiters were very attentive and discreet throughout, and our water and wine glasses were kept constantly full. Due to this, though, I was pretty sozzled by the time dessert came around. I think it was a chocolate and whiskey tart and I remember really liking it but further than that I can't tell you. Overall, my impression was 'hmmm, pretty nice place' rather than anything more exceptional. Would be happy to eat here again though. If I can find it.",

Atmosphere was good for a work night and I was grateful I had managed to get a booking at very short notice. But the food was (a little below) average. Service was the redeeming factor - very attentive for a busy place. The kitchen staff could see I was struggling with meat which had gone cold and offered to re-heat it. I don't think I'll go back for dinner.",

The three of us enjoyed a drink at the bar and oohed at the little grass patches on the way in to the restaurant. The meals were lovely and conversation pretty much stopped when we were munching our meaty roasts. The wine was outstanding so we sat and enjoyed another bottle after dinner. The atmosphere was relaxed while the staff were attentive. Not sure it quite lived up to all the hype, not the best roast meal I've ever had and given the location of the restaurant in the heart of Borough Market I had expected to see more interesting seasonal options at least with the veggie sides. But all in, a nice place to head for a quality meal. Crisp white linen, proper glasses and heavy cutlery. Old school in some ways but very enjoyable.",

We had booked for a fairly early seating on a Saturday morning shortly after it had opened yet there seemed to be a constant fuss at the entrance with checking coats and bags in and out. Once we got through all of that though, we walked into the magnificent dining room, with amazingly large windows and a bright airy space we all thought perfect for a wedding reception (or something like it). Our waiter didn't seem to bother us too much throughout the meal, providing both prompt and efficient service. They charged over \u00a312 for two eggs benedict, a little on the pricey side and even though they were good, they definitely weren't were that much. After we finished they took our plates and asked us if we wanted anything else. We didn't feel at all pressured to leave our seats despite the growing queue of people waiting to be seated around the corner at the entrance. I'd certainly be keen to see how they react during a dinner service.",
