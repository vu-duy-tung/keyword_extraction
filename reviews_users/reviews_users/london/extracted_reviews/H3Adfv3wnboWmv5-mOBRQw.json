I usually settle down and use the free wifi on my laptop, with a mug of Earl grey and one of the home made cakes. \u00a0Lovely.",

    "text": "This is about my fifth bad trip here, and I just need to vent. Let's start on a positive note: I love the setup, the menu selection, the availability of both indoors and outdoors seating. But seriously, someone sort out the staff! Every time there are about 4 or 5 people in the kitchen and two people behind the counter, and it takes ages to get an order in. I was third in line today and it took nearly 20 minutes. When I ordered, they asked if I was okay to wait 25 minutes for a salad. I admit, my response was quite curt, but I was so annoyed that I had waited so long to order in the first place. They made some snide comment about it feeling like McDonalds, and it took all my self control to be like 'you aren't a scratch on a McDonald's employee - you don't even know how to work a till'. But it was true. They didn't know how to work the till, and between this and selective attention from the team (the other guy was off discussing some event with a promoter most of the time), I was left waiting ages. When the food came out, they got my order wrong. They came out with the right order quickly, but it was over-salted. Sigh. Sort it out. I'm not giving up on you, but stop being too East End for your own good. Hire a good manager, provide training and know when to apologise for bad customer service.",

    "text": "An absolutely lovely cafe. Called the Gallery and tucked away on a side street behind 2 dark parasols next to York Hall, this little gem is a haven of chatter and light in Bethnal Green! On this busy Sunday, they ran out of mugs, were low on pastries, and had no more teapots to give me a large quantity of tea with. So I had just one mug. I happily would have stayed for much much longer because of this little secret: you see, in the back of the cafe, there is a greenhouse-like construct! The back corner has 2 walls and the ceiling made entirely out of glass, thus bringing in abundant quantities of that rare commodity in London we in the Med know as sunlight! So, of course, having retrieved my well-fought-for mug of tea, I sat down like a kitten in the windowed area next to a hot radiator, and started to purr. I'd happily go back anytime. It's busy, it's bustly, it's crowded and you end up sharing tables, but that seems to be part of the charm.Oh, and the loose leaf Darjeeling was lovely too!",

Everything served here is vegetarian and many things are vegan, so don't get your carnivorous hopes up should you order the sausage and mash (which is actually pretty good, considering I love the more pig-based variety). Meal portions are generous, and a special mention is necessary for the jacket potato i was recently given - as it was roughly the size of a small badger.Coffee is good if a little small, but ethical and averagely priced, and there is an impressive selection of organic teas and fruityness. They also do a nice range of cakes, which are very tasty but a bit expensive at \u00a32.50 - I'd strongly recommend the walnut brownies which are a bit cheaper, but avoid the vegan ones unless you know what you're doing!The free wi-fi can be a bit patchy, but it's a good place to sit and work anyway - with a nice conservatory part at the back providing plenty of light during the day, or the really comfy sofas at the front where I've been known to fall asleep. They have also started occasional late night openings on Fridays (11pm-ish) with live music, which are proving to be quite popular.",

The quality is generally above average, with the odd disappointment (the big breakfast/brunch thing), and the portions are always generous. I don't think of myself as a fan of vegan food, but I'll willingly eat theirs.

Not sure.) It has a really nice relaxed ambiance, despite it being so busy.A vegan fry-up wooshed passed under my nose when I walked in and I was set to have that until I saw the vegan burger. Glad I changed my mind! The burger was a handmade veggie-style burger (versus the meaty-style ones) on cibatta bread filled with vegan mayo and optional vegan cheese. Despite the devil's fruit in the sandwich and salad (cucumber), it was delicious and the salad was actually really good with what seemed to be a pesto/oil dressing. Oh, and I had a plain black Americano that was outstanding. You forget what good coffee tastes like until something like this jolts you back to your senses.And really odd for me, it sated me for at least 5 hours. Not one pang, craving or thought about my next meal. Now that IS a feat! I'm really excited to try the rest of the menu and also take my mom here. See you soon Gallery Cafe!",

I went there with a friend (a vegetarian) and she really liked the place. We studied for a few hours trying the great food, which is amazing. The atmosphere is great, very relaxing and peaceful. The staff are very polite & helpful. I had a great day studying there thank you. As a non-vegetarian myself I can say its a great place to eat for an one & I highly recommend going to eat there.",

It's a great little venue for this sort of thing, cosy and in the hippy area of Bethnal Green.There is patio area out the front, big wooden tables and parasols as standard. Moving inside the tables were set out almost as a gallery in long lines, which was perfect for the sort of event going on. Overall it was a really relaxed and understated atmosphere. Busy, very busy without feeling claustrophobic. \u00a0I'd ventured in for a pre-show tipple, but was greeted by a wonderful waft coming from the kitchen behind the counter. There were rustic and colourful slices of pizza out on display. Too tempting. So I enquire about a suitable bottled beer (no draft alas, but I aint in no pub) and get a knowledgeable response from the friendly hipster guy at the till. They also sell those natural lemonades you can get in Ikea! So I can't say much for the meals but I had my hearty vegan slice and a cold Witchcraft and sat outside content. There's also a big garden/grassy area out the back with plenty of bunting. All together an unpretentious, friendly, could be slightly cheaper (but couldn't everything) and yummy place to wile away a lazy summers eve.",

It's a large space with lots of seating and a lovely back garden (also with seating) when the weather is fine. \u00a0I noticed they had a couple of high chairs for people with children. \u00a0One thing: I was there twice in a week and both times I couldn't get the wifi to work. It wasn't a big deal for me because I didn't need it, but if you do, best ask before you order. \u00a0The sweets are mostly all vegan and really good!",

Gallery Cafe never fails to provide a nice counterpoint to London's pervasive gloom.I've always enjoyed both the coffee and the service here (some are volunteers - since the caf\u00e9 itself is actually a charitable organization that donates to social services), but mostly I like how relaxed it is... and that I can sit here for hours and hours writing away, while the crowds come and go during peak times, and nobody bats an eye. \u00a0P.S.

Got greedy and ordered the vegan pancakes too, and I was handsomely rewarded for my gluttony. They were crispy around the edge and yet soft and fluffy in the middle. The location itself is very spacious too. Don't be fooled by the small basement entrance. It has a lovely outdoor seating area too, which I'm sure is packed during summer.But the nicest thing about this place is that it opens at 9! Even on Sundays! And bank holidays. With the full menu being served since the time the doors open. How awesome is that? I'm definitely going here again.",

Great texture, nicely flavored, and the sourdough bun is swirled with vegan mayo that also passes muster. Side salad and a generous helping of fries rounds out the \u00a37.95 meal, and it was enough for me for a light lunch and dinner.Great seating area with plenty of light, and the vibe made me do doubletakes to make sure I hadn't warped back to Berkeley. The place can get packed on sunny weekends, but not much trouble finding a table if you don't mind a bit o' a squeeze. There's a little stage for live music as well!",

We were both happy with our selections albeit the portions were quite large (vegan pancakes and vegan full English) and the fresh orange juice was awesome. The coffee was a tad weak, but all in all the food was very very good. The major downside was one of the staff was sick and coughing all over everything....unfortunately, it was not only distracting, it was gross as she coughed as she prepped drinks from the coffee bar.",

The kitchens are notoriously grimey and I've received blank stares when I've politely suggested the volunteers clean the dirt from their fingernails. The unpaid volunteers are, not surprisingly, lacklustre on customer service, speed and manners. A vegan burger here generally means paying over \u00a36 for a big mushroom in bread. The food really does not live up to the pretty location. It's a shame because St Margaret's House is a fantastic charity - so check out the cute charity shop next door to support them.",

The caf\u00e9 is well-lit with large windows, and at the weekends you can enjoy sitting in conservatory. It serves up some tasty dishes such as tofu 'fish' and chips, stocks Ms Cupcakes' famous vegan cupcakes and you can choose from soya, almond or coconut milk for your chai latte/coffee. It's a chill places to work with decent wifi and ample seating in a fantastic neighbourhood. I will be back again and again.",

    "text": "Summary: + Charity-run veggie/ vegan caf\u00e9 in Bethnal Green + Spacious and well-lit dining area+ Good food! \u00a0Gallery Caf\u00e9 is a charity-run caf\u00e9 that serves vegetarian and vegan food. It is located just off Cambridge Heath Road on roughly half way point between Bethnal Green and Cambridge Heath stations. It's a little hard to find as it's off the main bus road, and is attached to a rather obscure non-commercial looking building. The sign is visible from outside but the actual entrance is on the lower ground, which makes it less noticeable. Do not be discouraged by all of these natural obstacles. This caf\u00e9 is very good. If you summon enough courage to get past the rather modest entrance area and push through the door green door, you will be looking into a surprisingly spacious restaurant with functional black round tables laid out along the length of the long dining area. On the white walls hang some pictures, presumably the name sake of the place. Towards the end of the restaurant, there is a small, slightly raised dining area, which overlooks a small garden. The natural light that pours in from the big windows helps brighten up this already pleasant space. I've heard this place also hosts various music events. So I'd imagine this small conservatory area will turn into a little stage on such occasions. I went in for a weekend breakfast. I ordered full English breakfast. I was very satisfied with the quality and portion of food. The vegetarian sausage was firm and had a nice herby flavour. The sourdough bread was crispy outside, and chewy inside. The visually most interesting item in this dish was scrambled tofu. It was fried with thinly chopped onions and carrots, seasoned with some spices. It was good but more on bland side. \u00a0The portion was also not bad for the price I paid. The service was also efficient and professional. I certainly wouldn't have guessed this was run by charity if I didn't know. I recommend giving this place a go next time you are in this part of town.",
