    "text": "Decent Mexican place. Really nice location and quick service. Staff is also kind. Their margaritas taste really good, and they are a good way of killing time while you wait for your table. Just go upstairs at the bar and get some drinks in the meantime! The food is ok, sometimes though it seats too much on then window and it becomes a little too cold in my opinion. Mexican food should be served really hot! Muy caliente! Other two things that might bother you are the fact that the place is VERY noisy (couldn't hear my friend from the other side of the table at times) and that the tables are extremely close to each other so you might end up dining in very close contact with strangers. Besides that, nice place",

I suggest getting the street food dishes 3or 4 each (im a girl )and then share with who ever your with! Great prices you cant really complain.

    "text": "Found this (pop up?) mexi kitchen along the south bank the other day when it was super hot. The place looked pretty cool and the balance of indoor/outdoor is great. As Mexican food suits hot days so thought why not. We were sat down in a pretty dark hot corner of the place (pretty sure the only table that is in a dark corner) despite asking to be put outside (there were free tables) so kinda sucked but you get that. The service was super slow and they came to take our order twice before we had menus. Our drinks never came so we didnt end up drinking anything and gave up trying to flag someone down. Just think our waitress maybe was distracted/hungover/having a bad day/?Despite this the food was pretty delicious. It wasn't mind blowing but the meat in the tacos (we had chicken, pork with tasty pickled onions and beef) was perfectly cooked. It would have been nice to have a couple of other bits and pieces in the tacos such us cabbage or salsa- I think Mexican works best when there is a balance of crunch, acid and soft. So maybe next time i would order some of the sides to add into the tacos. Eg extra guac mmmmFor sharing, it was a little confusing as to how much we should order. So we over ordered a little bit but this meant that we tried a lot of food! The guacamole was delicious but it was a little small (although we are all super into guac!) and the black beans side is absolutely amazing: highly recommended but quite cheesy. The slaw was perfectly seasoned and the salad with the beans had lots of crunchy pepitas in it. We found the specials after we ordered unfortunately because the prawn taco and cerviche special looked awesome. The pork burrito is highly recommended if not sharing and it's pretty big.Anyway with a little bit more attention and guidance, not necessarily time from our waitress our experience would have a bit better.",

Fortunately, I discovered Wahaca's chain of Mexican restaurants and I have been pleasantly surprised by both the tastiness of the food and the good value prices. \u00a0Yes it's never going to be good as Californian Mexican food, but it's the best I've found in London so far!",

Nonetheless, I *highly* recommend the pork burrito. I'm not a huge pork fan, but my burrito was juicy, tender, and bursting with flavour. It was easily the best one I've ever eaten!",

The guacamole was eatable but without much taste. The beef burrito was OK but not kick-ass. The fish burrito had no taste at all, chipotle sauce inside was barely noticeable. The only good surprise was the special chipotle prawn tacos. Overall, it wasn't bad, but not great either so I wouldn't recommend this place. I give 3* just because I've been to way worse places and 2* would't be fair.",

    "text": "Wahaca Southbank Experiment Restaurant is exactly what it says on the tin can! It's a completely out of the blue experiment in Southwark & it certainly should be a permanent fixture despite its rather different look of metal containers mixed and laced together at the top of the Southwark Centre which some may see it being different but once inside after going through some old plastic striped entrance you're amazed in the effort put here! Trendy is the word which fits the booming restaurant culture in Southbank Southwark in recent times! There is a bustle everywhere with stairs going up and down in a market like feel with waiters and chefs wandering around to serve you much like the markets of Mexico. We had to wait for about 15 minutes at the back of the restaurant which seemed a little different not being at the front but was worth it as there were an assortment of seats. \u00a0Once we got a seat for a small group of 5 of us, near the front again we were served very well on the food from the word go, it was very good as the waiters and chefs were very close by as we were virtually next to the kitchen on the ground floor, we ordered 2 Wahaca Food selections of \u00a323 and I have to say this assortment of tacos and quesdillas was the best choice for the price, you get the following:-Pork pibil tacosWinter veg tacos vCorn, black bean & guacamole tostadas vChorizo & potato quesadillaSweet potato & feta taquitos vSpicy slawAnd we ordered some Chicken Tinga and guacamole nachos for starters.Second thing we noticed is that all for this food arrived at once after 10 minutes, to standards this is very good, no waiting around and getting food straight to the point, there were a lot of small dishes that I see to the eye that I couldn't tell the different tacos, tostadas and taquitos, really what are the subtle differences, they all look bright and colourful. Trying each of them was a joy to behold, eating the starters of nachos were good but the ones to have were for sure the pork pibil tacos which had braised shoulder of pork cooked in Yucatecan marinade, they were small portions but delightful to eat. The uncertain one which look like a mish mash of vegetables mounting over a potato like roll which was described by them as a roasted sweet potato, feta and caramelised red onion wrapping in crispy blue corn dotted with salsas and chipotle mayo, it was a gouge on all the taste buds. For me, the hidden gem which were had a lot of was the black bean and cheese quesadillas, they are essentially flat bread corn tortillas with black bean filling and bay leaf avocado, it was really divine like eating a sweet vegetable filled crisp biscuit! The chicken Tinga and winter veg tacos were nice with various smoky sauces added to the condiment but for me it was the black bean cheese quesadilla was different to have that!! All in all, it was great, the service was gokd, the assortme of food was good but best of all were the conversations to had here in this restaurant! A good way to see off a friend!",

So we had a walk in the area and picked Wahaca, which was very adventurous to me as, well... I am intolerant to chili! Why would someone intolerant to chili go to a Mexican restaurant? Because my friend told so many great stuffs about it that I needed to try. And I did well trying.First, the food. we first had tortilla chips with guacamole as starters, then yummy crispy tacos, and finally beef steak with rice and black beans. With a couple of pacificos, all for \u00a340 ish. Not a bad deal right? Most amazing is that it was good, I felt filled when we left the place.Next, the service. I always live awkward moments when I tell waiters that I am intolerant to chili (such a rare case, isn't it?), and I suspected it would be even more so than usual because it's a Mexican restaurant. \"Challenge accepted\" he said, and he was very kind with us during our meal. The kind of service I remember!Good place, in one of the most lovely areas of London. I'll go there again, for sure!",

Recently I was walking past (3 times now) hungry and when it was quiet so thought I'd have a butchers and see what the hullabaloo is about!So I've never indulged in a burrito apparently and I'm thrilled to announce that this Street kitchen has burst my burrito cherry. Mazaltof.On a serious note the food here is awesome and it costs slightly over a fiver for a bulging burrito baby wrapped in tin foil - and amazingly enough, it's not messy to eat either! Considering all the stuff stuffed in there, waiting to fall out and stain your clothes, it stays together until the last bite. Maybe they're back belts in origami or something, but they're actual delights to eat. So if you're all dressed up, don't worry about this being a messy meal, because it's not and they're super easy to eat on the go (considering my dislike of sitting for extended periods of time, this is a dream) though there is some seating if you're so inclined.My favourite is the chicken, swiftly followed by the steak. Both very fresh, meaty and generous portions of meat and this awesome green rice, lathered in sauces - however spicy you want it. I tried the pulled pork and didn't really like that. It's a bit chewy and is tangled in bigger clumps so is actually awkward and messy to eat, plus it wasn't the most amazing pulled pork I've ever had. I'm not saying I disliked it, but I'd rather a big mac. The other burritos are a dream though.Beware it gets very busy at peak times, but they serve you quite quickly and the food is worth it.",

This is much better than any other Mexican food I have had in the UK but......... Give the praise that had been given to Ms Myers I would expect more. Also the prices are ridiculous and this food should not be expensive. Perhaps I have been spoiled by real street food in Mexico and the excellent offerings I have in New York but this stuff isn't hard. The tortillas were lacking that beautiful perfume that comes when they are so fresh, it was such a shame. True Mexican food has to come from the heart with passion and I think that is very hard to capture in any sort of chain restaurant. I'm glad I tried but I wouldn't go back.",

OK, I was HUNGRY, but this place delivered. So if you fancy a walk down Southbank and come over peckish one lunchtime, then for \u00a35-\u00a36 (burrito bargain!) you too can be treated to a chicken, pulled pork, beef or vegetable taco or burrito with salad, beans, cheese and a lovely bit of medium spice sauce. Don't I sound like a sales person?! I sould get freebies for this ;)Mexican street food as it should be, better than the burrito I had in Angel from Tortilla - same price but much more flavour.",

And Southbank is such a beautiful place to wander, so this is review of their takeaway van, not the restaurant)It can get pretty busy- it's right next to the National Theatre, so around showtimes and lunchtimes particularly, but EVEN at these times I've only had a ten minute wait max, and the service is still impeccable.Think Subway, but with mexican food. You can pick your own EVERYTHING, meat sauces, vegetables, rice, taco/burrito/nachos/other-mexican-wheat-based-products whatever you fancy! It's also pretty big, so perfect for sharing with a close friend (ask them to cut it in half for you) or just if you're starving and want to keep it all to yourself!Personally I recommend the pork with lettuce and sour cream, my favourite.Service is always with a smile, although a little rush- as is the necessity for a takeaway. My only criticism is their lack of a card machine (and cash machines are always a bit of a mess on Southbank) so my advice?Grab some cash on your way to Southbank.Get off at Embankment, take a look around Southbank, on your way back stop off at Wahacas and dig into the best burrito you have EVER tasted on your walk back across the bridge.",

    "text": "Speaking from a Mexican living in London prospective, you must believe that this place is so far the best Mexican I've had since I moved here a year ago.The chicken tinga tacos was delish, as well as the quesadillas with the chile de arbol dip. The chile de arbol salsa might not be home made but it still satisfied my hunger for spice in Mexican food. Staff was friendly and food took a bit long, but it didnt matter when there were drinks to keep us busy :P I also tried the exploratory menu they had temporarily which was barbacoa, which wasn't that great. Didn't taste authentic at all,but it wasnt part of the real menu which was probably a good thing. As far as quality of food this place is a must try.",

    "text": "Wahaca is located near British Film Institute. It's a 15 min walk to Blackfriars (trust me the walk will do you good, after the food).The views across the river are good, if you are lucky you might be able to see St.Paul's in the distance.It was very busy given the fact that it was a Saturday night in London. We didn't make any reservations, so we were asked to sit in the bar upstairs and wait for the buzzer to go. No sooner had we got our drinks, the buzzer buzzed and we walked down to be seated. Luckily we got window seats and this adds to the experience.The menu is essentially Mexican food in small sharable platters. It's the usual tacos, burritos etc but slightly different. Since the portions are small, you do end up ordering quite a bit and the cumulative effort is worth the experience.They do an interesting drink called Micaela, which is a mexican beer in a glass with mexican spices and chilli. It's a fantastic explosion of taste and a sensational feeling as it goes down! I loved it!For dessert I tried churros. It is a kind of crunchy donuty thing with a cup of chocolate sauce with the premise being \"dip and dunk\". It was awesome.So after all the food, the micaelas and the churros, the walk upto Blackfriars felt like liberation.I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here and I highly recommend this place.Tip: Try the Micaela, the churros and the walk upto Blackfriars looking at St Pauls.",

It's a weird space, long and thin but they've done pretty well with it. Not sure if it's a pop up or a temp street kitchen. Whatever it is, it works! I've been a few times and couldn't get seated. This time we waited the 45 minutes upstairs in the bar. We had horchatas which were so yummy. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. Food came out pretty fast, despite how busy they are. You can see the kitchen preparing the food which is cool. I'd recommend it! And if you don't want to wait for a table, just go down the stairs to Wahaca's food truck right on the river side!",

    "text": "Needing food in a pinch near the BFI, I stopped by here because (a) the food was ok when I was in their proper restaurant and (b) they accepted card, despite essentially being a street food stand.I put in my simple order: chicken taco, no beans, no guacamole, and tortilla chips. You pay extra for the guac, and my wife, who was sharing, detests beans. So I made extra sure of what I was asking for; the server even relayed the order to me correctly.Of course, I received chicken tacos, but with beans and guac. Ok I could have noticed the server adding beans, but I was paying at the time. And I wasn't totalling up in my head to make sure I wasn't receiving unwanted extra guac. But I am the customer, not their supervisor; and as mentioned, I was in a hurry so couldn't go back once we started eating.The food was tasty enough once my wife had picked off the beans. There didn't seem very much chicken (there were more beans) and there was a bone included (at no extra charge). Whilst I didn't try their whole menu, I don't hold out much hope that you'd receive what you ask for, so taste takes a back seat here, I'm afraid.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant as we departed the London Eye looking for a quick bite to eat. We did not realize we would be eating some of the best Mexican food and beverage delights we would ever consume in our life. Drinks: Amazing amazing amazing drinks. We both started with Passionfruit Margaritas which were delicious and refreshing. Then we upgraded to Hibiscus Margaritas (tart yet balanced) and the Wahaca Mule. Excellent choices all around. Food: This was outstanding, \"kiss-your-mother-and-tell- her-you- love-her-and-make-peace-with-your-siblings\" good Mexican food. We started with the Duck Croquets which were succulent and accented with a delicious smoky hibiscus and chipotle salsa. The grilled chicken in the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Tacos tasted as if it was marinated for 24 hours. It was so so good. But my favorite of all the dishes was the Sustainable Battered Cod Tacos. I'm not the biggest fan of fish and chips (I like seasoning. They traditionally lack it.) but these were outstanding. The toppings of pickled cucumber and shredded slaw added so much freshness and was balanced with the tang of the chipotle mayo and creama. Service: Our server Juan was delightful and very attentive. Such a nice guy. The atmosphere was fun and playful. Music was playing in the background but you can still have a conversation with the person in front of you without having to shout. The shipping containers make for fun decor and the benches are soft and inviting (they have cushions!!!.) Overall, excellent and highly recommended. Family friendly as well. Will come back if we are ever in the area! Thanks guys!",

It's so bright and fun and different and it's just really funky. 2) They put my massive tortilla salad on this tiny serving dish. Really weird choice of platter. 3) Their payment is system is ON POINT. Yes, you have to download an app, but it took me 2 minutes to set the entire thing up and then you can see the entire groups bill and can choose your option and pay for it individually. It was actually sort of fun (yeah I'm serious) and you can see who is paying for what and I love it. Obviously you wouldn't do this if you were splitting the bill. So, now I'll talk about the food. I liked my salad in a deep fried tortilla. I added extra veggies and it was filing and quite delicious. I enjoyed their hot sauce, even though it wasn't very hot. But it was tasty and flavourful. A very good option if you're searching for a place to eat for lunch.",

They weren't as good as normal but at least tasted okay in the end.The staff weren't very attentive and spent a lot of time talking to each other - and they were all sitting at a big round table eating (maybe give them a break room, Wahaca!)Overall I enjoyed the meal enough but definitely not my favourite Wahaca.",

I had the passion fruit and hibiscus cooler which is a lovely sweet but not too sweet lunch time non alcoholic drink. I then had the prawn tacos - which were very tasty but quite small. A side of frijoles which I love - so creamy and tasty. And a chicken quesadilla which I can never not order at Wahaca. The food was as good as ever so please do head back!!",

    "text": "Great food, service and atmosphere - one of the best places to go for Mexican along the Thames...This was my first visit to Wahaca's and I'll definitely look to go back - the shipping container venue is unique, with its vibrant colours and loud music sucking you into the theme of the restaurant. The servers are quick, friendly and very helpful - writing their names on your menu, circling the specials and pointing out how to order (it might be slightly confusing otherwise with the multiple options throughout), I liked the hands on approach.The food itself was delicious; all very fresh and quickly served. It all comes as it is prepared, so we got a side of sweet potatoes knowing they would be with us as a 'starter' - I can't recommend these enough, and we ended up fighting over them on our table.Once finished with our meal we could have paid with the Wahaca app which is another nice touch if you don't want to have to wait for the bill... Admittedly it wasn't working on the day, but I will definitely give it a go next time I visit.Overall a great meal and a venue that I look forward to going back to in the near future!",

    "text": "Tasty and very attentive waitress.The location is unbeatable. It's located directly on the Southbank and if you sit in the upper level (which you should ask for) you have an amazing view on the Thames. I would even ask for it if there is a small waiting time because the walk along Southbank is beautiful and you can do that while waiting.The food is very good. Not too spicy even if it says spicy. The portions are average size and considering the location not too expensive. I had a Taco Salad which really filled me.The cocktails are also very good. I had a Mojito and it tasted amazingly. The prices for the cocktails are okay, too.I would definitely recommend the restaurant and a walk down the Thames afterwards. I think you could mostly enjoy the stay at the restaurant and the walk if it's a nice night without rain.",

Chicken burritos are filled to bursting, and the marinated chicken is moist and juicy with a beautiful mild spice that is delicious. They are also the hugest portion of chicken (more than a double meat portion at barburrito) that you'll ever see. Great value, great food, great service. You actually can't ask for more. Amazing!!!!!",

The environment is different, yet impressive with their creativity. Prices are reasonable and I would definitely go again if I were in dire need of some good Mexican food.",

    "text": "We arrived in London in the late afternoon on the 4th of July and little did I know that I was going to find an awesome little Mexican food truck right in the heart of the Southbank Center. Boy, was I elated!! \u00a0Wahaca's Mexican Food Street Kitchen has an actual restaurant that sits in an old shipping container which overlooks the Thames river. There is also a little food truck for as the British say (take away). This is one of many chain restaurants in London but believe me you will not be disappointed with the choices they offer. The line was extremely short and before you know it we were ready to place our order. I chose to have the chicken burrito loaded with lettuce, green rice, cheese, hot salsa and crema. I really didn't expect London to have good Mexican food but I was mistaken. This was one of the best burrito's I have ever had. The chicken was fresh and spiced just right. The flavors that were cooked into the chicken were like none I had ever tasted before, so savory. I absolutely devoured this burrito. My husband enjoyed the pork burrito leaving out the rice but told me how delicious it still was. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service was quick and easy. We shared a table with some lovely and friendly British people. They were very kind and we were able to spend a little time chatting with them. When you happen to be in this incredible city, and are craving some Mexican food, be sure to give this hot little spot a try!",

The menu is typical of what you would expect from Mexican restaurants with a twist. The margarita are going, the guac is also not bad. The waiters have ADD, but typical of English service. It was OK, barely but nothing to rave about... I wouldn't try it again.",

I was walking to the OXO tower and saw the Wahaca truck for the first time. \u00a0It must be good. \u00a0I think I waited around 20 minutes in 32 degree weather for a burrito and it was worth it! \u00a0There aren't a whole lot of options, burrito or taco really. \u00a0They don't offer different types of rice or beans - it's either you want it or not. \u00a0You can get it with chicken, beef or pulled pork. \u00a0I'm usually don't go for pulled pork but when the guy in front of me ordered it, I had to get it. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0Definitely on the top of my list for my burrito fix.",

I'v quite confident, that my next time in London i will come here as well :) We had some different tacos, the guacamole and the Hibiscus-ice tea. lovely! With the bill, you get a small set of chili seeds. I tried to grow them. Unfortunately they died, but I think that's more my fault than Wahacas' haha! Already looking forward to going back in January.",
