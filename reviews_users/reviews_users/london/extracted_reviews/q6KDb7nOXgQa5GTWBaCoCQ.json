The portions are huge and so spot-hitting you'd be willing to pay just about anything. Luckily the place is also reasonably priced so there's no fear of losing an arm or a leg when the check comes. I'd wager that the only medical procedure you might require is arterial bypass; these guys aren't stingy with the cheese.It's just a fun family spot with hearty fare. It'll go in my little black book for sure.",

    "text": "The plan was to meet at the pub next door, then pop over to Ciao Bella for a low-key bite. And what an experience! There's seldom a vibe that can be matched by a bustling cheery Italian restaurant \u00a0this place was absolutely heaving, filled with happy, chatting people and fuelled by the boisterous waiters rushing about despatching plates to tables with a certain brash informality.The piano player was over on one side of the room, standing behind his upright piano (no room for anything else in here!), and making his way between lounge standards and old songs that everyone knows \u00a0though you could scarcely hear him over the din.I wouldn't give this place any awards for the food, that's for sure. But you get the feeling it's more designed as the Cheap & Cheerful student haunt or casual meal spot \u00a0and who complains about a starter being a plate of microscopic previously frozen prawns in sauce when it's only cost you \u00a36.50, and you've got access to bottles of house red wine for \u00a313.50. In Bloomsbury!Spaghetti Carbonara is a bit like the Sweet & Sour Pork equivalent of Chinese food \u00a0it's probably not particularly authentic or subtle, but you can get it almost everywhere, and I really like it: so that's my Italian yardstick. And on this occasion it was different. Not bad at all, but certainly not what I was expecting. But again \u00a0for \u00a38, and accompanied by wine, good vibe, and excellent conversation, I'd go back in & have it tomorrow!The piano player belts out a chorus of Old MacDonald's Farm from the piano, totally unnoticed by anyone. We applaud at the end: he looks up with surprise that anyone's paid any attention and smiles at us, where many others in the room stop talking to see what the fuss was about, and several suddenly realise there's a piano there. The restaurant was full when we arrived, and people are still arriving as we leave.How have I not heard of this place before?",

Not cool.Service:This was the real killer. \u00a0We arrived and were brusquely directed downstairs, and as we walked down, the oddly toneless order \u00a0'you must leave by 8pm' (giving us 40 minutes) was called down to us. \u00a0No questioning whether that would be ok, or stating it politely. \u00a0Luckily, it was ok!On arrival downstairs, a very pissed off looking waiter greeted us with a frown and a 'there is no space'. \u00a0I replied that we had been told we could come down, as long as we left by 8pm. \u00a0He sighed, said 'ok then', and pointed to a table. \u00a0We were left to squeeze past the diners on the very close table behind ours, and jam our coats on the back of our chairs. \u00a0Already fuming, I was tempted to leave. \u00a0Wine calmed me down, but the surly, frankly shit service continued throughout the meal. \u00a0When he was cheesing my plate up, the same pissed-off waiter barely kissed my food with a light powdering of the good stuff before huffily, distractedly moving as if to go. \u00a0When I politely said that I'd like a little more, he sighed loudly before tetchily scratching a bit more on and leaving, again too rapidly.Don't get me started on how long it took to get the dessert menu or bill. \u00a0No further attention was paid to us, and I had to resort to waving, which made me feel very rude.A different, very nice old waiter came to us at the end when we needed change, and he was charming.Reading the other reviews here, I feel even more cheated. \u00a0Perhaps this was just an unusually lousy evening, with angry young staff \u00a0frustrated by the lateness of their much needed salt delivery.",

I've never bothered to ask about it, but the little chunks of Parmesan to nibble on while you wait (is it parm? could be summat else) are divine.The service is brusque, so if you're going with people who tend to be indecisive, prepare to be scowled at and have the staff walk off. They do this regardless of if the place is packed or just opened and you're the only table. That said, if you're in a rush for something and can get a table, it's pretty easy to be in and out of here with a good meal in your belly. I think there's a small discount for takeaway dining if you're local, but I wouldn't recommend it. I once called in an order, was told 20 minutes, and then stood there like a plank waiting for another 30 minutes. Had I not already paid, I would've left. I'd recommend a reservation for nighttime dining. But as a good place for a date? Come on, y'all. It'd be like taking a date to your nana's kitchen.",

The woman was very accommodating and booked the two of us for 7:30. We finally get there promptly and ask for our table. One of the owners scours the book looking for my name, thinking that I'm trying to pull one over on him. Apparently, his Mama took the reservation, but forgot to put it on the books. He said she does this often.No harm, no foul. We were seated immediately. Ordered a bottle of Chianti, a side and our entr\u00e9es. The food was amazingly good. The service was wonderful and definitely has that down home Italian hospitality about the place. Great find and one I'd definitely recommend going to.

Everything I said in my first review holds true, and what follows here are more details from a second visit.I can't say enough good things about this place: \u00a0it's a great atmosphere; it's local; it's good food; the servings are generous; it's well-priced (pizzas and pastas for \u00a37); they give you free starters of olives and parmesan. Contrary to many Yelp reviews, I find the waiters here to be amiable and efficient. This time I ordered the canneloni with spinach and ricotta, and it was as hearty and flavorful as my pesto linguine was. A friend ordered a pizza, which had a medium-thick crust and a robust tomato sauce. The pizzas and the calzones are big enough for two kind-of-hungry people or one hungry student. House wine starts at \u00a312 per bottle.We barely got in without a reservation on a Friday night around 7:30, so make sure to book in advance if you want to go on the weekend. On a weeknight, however, it's less crowded and you needn't make a reservation.",

If they are full, they might try and put you downstairs, which definitely isn't as nice. Try and get upstairs next to the window so you can look out onto Lamb's Conduit Street or near the piano (if you are lucky/unlucky they will be playing)The food is excellent- I can't have cow's milk (boo) but am a massive fan of pizzas and was extremely impressed when they offered to make me up a calzone with buffallo mozzerella.

    "text": "A lovely restaurant. Lovely lovely. After walking past a couple of times and seeing everyone so happy and smelling delicious Italian smells, I went in and my life changed for the better. Everything on the menu is delicious. The pastas, the pizzas, the mains, the wines - all delicious. It's a general Italian menu, so they have your usual selection of pizza margherita, spaghetti bolognese, and bruschetta alongside more Italian dishes like osso bucco and calf's liver. They also have gluten-free pasta on hand, as many Italians are celiacs.It's really a neighborhood place: the best time to come is Sunday afternoon, when families who have just been at the children's park at the end of Lamb's Conduit come for lunch. Also, it seems like the waiters have certain hiring requirements (besides being Italian): have a potbelly, have a mustache, be partly balding, and know how to unnecessarily assist a lady up the stairs. My Italian friend likes this place so much that we just went again with her Italian boyfriend (so you know it's authentic!)The only issue I have is with the downstairs dining room. Upstairs and outside are fine, but downstairs is cramped and noisy and frequently overheated. I'd recommend making a reservation at busy times (7-9 pm, weekend lunch) to avoid getting stuck down there.",

    "text": "As we all know - only one thing is important when you go for an Italian meal. You want an authentic Italian family screaming at each other. Now, I don't care if it's real - of if they hire a bunch of Italian actors. I just want to feel like I'm in a mafia movie. This is exactly why we take girls to Italian restaurants for dates. The girl can soak up all the candle and romance nonsense; whilst we're entertained by imagining Al Pacino is going to bust in any second with a gun. This is why I love Ciao Bella so much. You can get a seat literally right by the kitchen. It appears to be family owned - I assume this because there are always a bunch of Italian people arguing by the cash register. But please, don't be put off. It's not like when us English argue, all bitter and annoying. It's Italian style; it adds flair to the restaurant. And luckily, the food tastes awesome. My reason for finding the restaurant was quite a sad one. Someone I love was in Great Ormond Street Hospital next door for quite a while. But, this restaurant was so great that for a few hours at a time - our stresses and worries would be lifted. We were in Italy. Sipping wine, eating AGNELLO alle CASTAGNE - and for us males, a mafia movie fantasy being fulfilled. It can be loud, it can be quiet. It can be romantic, it can be all hustle and bustle. It's a restaurant that changes and somehow seems to magically adapt to your needs. But more than anything the important thing to know is that the portions are generous and it all tastes amazing.",

Once seated, we were greeted by the owner (who immediately recognized my friends) and promptly given a coupon for a percentage off our meal. Excellent!Then we took some time to peruse the menu (which was mainly Italian pasta and fantastic desserts) before deciding. Let me say that our meal was FANTASTIC. Amazing pasta with large portions. I adore the desserts as I had some of their gelato while my friends shared a ginormous dessert concoction. The service was brusque but whatever, I'm here to enjoy hanging out with my friends and having a wonderful conversation filled with laughter and good food. This more than fits the bill!I definitely recommend coming here a bit early. It gets crowded quickly so grab a spot with a date or some good friends and settle in for a great evening.",

Then they generally give you pretty abrupt and brusque service, all the more to get you sitting, ordering, eating, and leaving quickly. Not quite as nice. However, they more than make up for it by giving you amazing, fresh-cooked, well-priced, ridiculously tasty pasta. The massive plate of linguine with pesto for \u00a37 is so good that I left the restaurant and immediately began discussing when we could return so I could eat it again. REALLY NICE. And remember the not-so-nice part? They tried to hurry us along by giving us someone else's order, but then apologised by giving us free pizza bread. So much to give. The only problem in my book? Ciao Bella gives you such crazy garlic breath that you could slay an army of bloodthirsty vampires with a single exhale. Give it a few minutes before you make out with anyone.",

Good thing my friends and I have already put Ciao Bello on our list of things to do when I make my visit next month!Great nights often started at this restaurant. It was the combination of cheap wine, great food, and warm atmosphere that puts people in the right mood to be adventurous in roaming the city after dinner. The restaurant is compact, so you tend to get a bit intimate with those around you. Also, there might be quite a wait during dinner time, but you can easily slip on over to the pub next door (The Lamb??) for a few drinks as you wait. Once seated, you are greeted with olives, cheese and breadsticks, but be careful not to spoil your appetite. My personal favourite was the seafood pasta that came in a greaseproof bag. Sadly, I always order too much, yet too little...meaning I'd fill myself up on olives and either the avocado vinaigrette or avocado prawn cocktail. All this before my pasta even arrives... not to mention the wine. Did I mention their wine is cheap?",

I had the spaghetti carbonara and was very pleased with it. The prices were good too, for the portion size. It's a lovely authentic Italian place, and certainly one of the better ones I've tried in London. Definitely a good spot if you're looking to carbo-load with some good pasta.",

It was chilly and raining outside, but they had heaters and an awning that made it comfortable enough to sit outside. I can't give this place the best rating because the service was really disappointing. After standing awkwardly in the doorway while the waitress chatting with another employee, she finally acknowledged us. After telling her we didn't have a reservation, she made a noticeable sigh and told us that we should have one - sorry.. Then when she said we could sit outside, our waiter was noticeably annoyed to be serving us. He took our order in a hurry and didn't even ask what we would like to drink - we had to remind him. He was also incredibly hard to get the attention of. Granted the restaurant was very crowded, but then he was obviously overworked and someone should be helping him manage all the tables! We also asked for our check multiple times until finally a different woman brought it out for us. The seating outside is incredibly crowded as well. You can't get out without bothering everyone around you.The food is this place's redeeming factor however. I got the pasta w/ clams, and it was very delicious. All my friends got either another pasta or pizza, and they all were extremely satisfied as well. Overall, the food was good enough to make us forget about the subpar service.",

Service was excellent, and the place is pretty lively for a Sunday night in London filled with people.

The high star reviews are fair and appropriate. Firstly, the spot was packed and buzzing when we arrived at 10 or so. Very good vibe. Seemed that every seat inside and outside were taken-we were happy to get sat immediately. As we walked in, the person who turned out to be our server was NOOOOOTTTT happy with the hostess, let her know and continued with her busy tables without missing a beat. Was awesome.As we sat munching on breadsticks (bf munched on the olives placed on the table-he said they were delicious), I marveled at the packed house; some two tops, four tops and a few huge parties and how they were all being served with ease. The spot is very West Village...buzzing with Italian being yelled across tables, fabulous aromas, good looking wine and American cinema kitsch EVERYWHERE. So much to see! Love the Stevie Wonder piece above the piano! Oh yes-when we arrived, there was this cat crooning as he played piano. Very cool. I can't agree about what others describe as \"noisy\", but then again-I'm noisy. Bf and I were all in the business of the couple next to us-I can't tell you how amazing the pizza looked! I mean...we wanted to ask for a bite. We only didn't order pizza because I felt like having pasta for the first time...dunno. Months easy. I never eat pasta. I ordered my fave-linguni with nothing but steamed broccoli. The broc (my fave food) was seriously just picked. SO fresh!!! Bf said his lasagna was amazing.Finally, it's so freakin' beyond reasonably priced. Cheap.The dessert menu was pretty cool. I never eat dessert, but was happy to see some mainstays that reminded me of old school Italian spots when I was little.This spot is a must.",

If you don't have a 'booking,' they stick you in the crowded basement where you are basically on top of the neighboring table. No complaints about the food, but no raves about it either. It is fine. The service leaves a lot to be desired. Try La Bardigiana. It's closer to the Underground, and the food and service is much better.",

The most appealing aspect of this venue is that it caters to a wide range of budgets and tastes. When I was a broke student, I went there for their hearty and flavourful under-\u00a310 pasta offerings and now I appreciate their really extensive wine list (representing every wine growing region of Italy!) and finer offerings such as their Trout in Almond Sauce - on the bone (or as our Italian waiter said - 'As God made it') - and Duck in Orange Sauce. The seating is certainly cramped given how popular the establishment is but it adds more to the intimacy than to the annoyance really... this place is a gem...",

When it's cold outside and you have people willing to sit outside anyway, you know this place it quite special. I can say this was quite decent. Like other ethnic restaurants, when the staff, clientele and menus are in the language, I tend to believe a little more than otherwise. Which is the case here. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I appreciate it. We sat outside and I practiced my limited italienne (thank you music lessons) and ordered a simple pizza. It was a good size, I think at least three people could have been fed with it. That day I was quite hungry and ate more than half by my small self. nbd!We picked the cheapest white they had and for London it was okay. They had better more expensive wine that I will one day try when I start making money again. The price of the food wasn't too bad for the Bloomsbury area. All in all I would return for a lovely time.",

The service split between my two visits ranged from prompt but indifferent to could be quite good but is either too busy or too undertrained in service or, possibly, English. Really, Ciao Bella is worth a visit and, for the most part, will not disappoint, provided you temper your expectations. And remember, a packed house can't be wrong. Right?That your arrival is greeted with cheese, bread sticks and olives is a really nice touch, especially when you arrive hungry. You will be greeted promptly and offered libations in that same breath. Drinks will be brought quickly and, at that time, you'll be queried for your order. If you're not yet ready, checking back may take awhile, and this will be a running theme. Stages in the course of your visit are generally executed rapid fire; except check backs. And this includes the main course. There was an issue with my entree making it inedible to me. Despite having consumed everything but the entree, and with salad plate still lingering, a staff member swooped \u00a0in to grab my plate, while in motion asking if \u00a0I was finished. When I tried to explain that I hadn't even started, because ... The plate was set back down with a comment about letting me take me time. This missed the point entirely, and before I could explain, this person quickly vanished. Let's be clear here: they made it right, but not without some effort and frustration. I truly think they mean well and want you to enjoy your meal. However, they seem to lack a certain amount of polish and adequate staffing. That said, I still recommend Ciao Bella. As long as you know what you're in for, you'll likely have an enjoyable experience again and again.",

He's a great guy and really enjoys what he's doing.The food of course is why you walk in. It is spectacular! The pizza is insanely good with fresh herbs and an amazing sauce.

The well-painted, but also kitschy murals; the piano man who started playing singing out of nowhere (most of us thought that was a bar - nope, a piano!); the fast-talking no-nonense wait staff - it's all quite nice.I was there with a large party of about 15-20 people for a birthday and they went out of their way to make sure we were all taken care of. 3 people arrived really late (as the rest were beginning to get main courses served) and the kitchen rushed their orders so that the late arrivals still got their main courses before the rest of us had finished. They made a beautiful chocolate birthday cake for our friend who was celebrating. The buffalo mozzarella starter is amazing and every one liked their pizzas and pastas for mains - even if we were all shocked by the portion size! I had pesto linguine and the pesto was really lovely.My only complaint is that by 9:30 or so it was packed and insanely loud. Shouting to the person next to you at dinner is less than ideal.Bonus: actor spotting. That was just something fun.",

    "text": "I always try to steer clear of simple meals like spaghetti bolognese or carbonara as I like to try new meals that require some difficulty in cooking when dining out, but Ciao Bella's carbonara is so tasty that I never have to spend time browsing the menu as it's such an easy choice. Their portions are generous, and I really love that all the waiters and staff are italian which gives the place a nice authentic vibe. I would recommend booking a table upstairs as the downstairs area is very squeezed for space in comparison to the more spacious and lively top floor.",

    "text": "Ciao Bella is the real deal.You'll no doubt be squeezed into a table, elbow to elbow with your neighbours (because they seem to always be full unless you eat about 9.30pm) and your waiter will rush you along almost like he doesn't want you to be there. But don't be put off by that, don't rush, he'll come back once you're ready to order. It's almost an initiation test!The food here is fantastic. Obviously fresh, super tasty and quite reasonably priced too. They'll give you some olives and cheese to nibble on whilst you decide what you want and they're a good omen - great olives and crumbly parmesan. Not at all bad for free.Shared a couple of starters; some juicy bruschetta (seasoned perfectly) and 3 large sardines, which were grilled and the spines came away with ease - leaving no bones at all. Colour me very happy at this stage. For a main I went for a special - the rabbit with pappardelle - mostly because it's my favourite type of pasta. And it was huge. I think I had half a rabbit on my plate. My friend went for the seafood spaghetti and it's served in a brown bag and practically poured onto your plate at the table. Nice touch.The wine list here is a weighty tome, so if you know your reds you're in for a treat.Overall, great experience and would love to come back. It's not at all fancy, so you can dress as casual or as smart as you like. Try and grab an outside seat in the summer!",

    "text": "We went to Ciao Bella because the other Italian food restaurant we we're planning to eat at was closed for the May Bank Holiday. We saw that Ciao Bella was opened and decided to try it out. We showed up right at noon when they were opening, but there was already a large gathering of what looked to be \"regulars\" on the front patio area. They were also all speaking Italian, so we thought that was a good sign! However, our server was indifferent at best with us, while he cracked jokes with his regulars. We truly felt like he didn't want us there. The food we ended up eating was mediocre and I probably could have made better at home. My husband got the cannelloni, which was bland, and I got the carbonara, which had a broken sauce and overcooked pasta. There are plenty of better Italian food options elsewhere in London.",

    "text": "Came in as a party of 8 (including four hungry teens) from a rainy, cold London post-British Museum. Mid-week lunch rush, no reservations. Having only read about Ciao Bella on Yelp and knowing it was a relatively close walk from the museum, I dutifully led my large party to the restaurant, hoping for the best. It did not disappoint.Despite the restaurant being packed, the owner was more than gracious when I told him of our party size. He immediately called existing reservations to see if they were showing up (some were, some were not). Ultimately, the best he could do (and he did it quickly) was to split us up into multiple tables, which we gratefully accepted.As others have noted, the food is really excellent and authentic (the staff appear to be all part of the same Italian family and the owners). The portions are large, service was brisk and friendly, and the price, more than reasonable. We were in and out in less than 45 minutes and didn't feel rushed at all. In terms of standout food, oddly enough, the spaghetti Bolognese was particularly good - light and filled with flavor. Overall, the kitchen there really knows how to cook pastas of all kinds, which makes an enormous difference for Italian food. Will absolutely go back when I'm next in London.",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday night. The bagged bread sticks are a bit tacky but we were served complimentary olives and cheese which was very tasty. There was a live piano player, but it was too hot inside so we asked to sit outside. They have outdoor seating, two rooms of dining on the main floor and another seating area downstairs, so they can definitely handle parties of all sizes. Bring the whole family! The first impression we got was there are a lot of regulars here... made me a bit jealous... guess I'll have to come more often. We started off with the night's special Calamari. I saw the word calamari and just ordered it. I didn't read the description, I just knew I wanted it, and it was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. It isn't your typical fried calamari with boring marinara sauce and tartar sauce or even the very over played but still delicious chargrilled calamari. It was slightly spicy for flavor and a bit soupy. There is no separation of the squid, just the whole squid cooked in the sauce. If they have this on the menu still. Get it. Then we had the tagliatelle \"ciao bella\" which was very good for the first few bits. Creamy and wonderful. But the more I ate the more I felt it was a bit salty and the presentation a bit disappointing. The salmon was broken up into small pieces which to me makes it look like the dish was for a very large child.... which I am so I was fine with it, but if you're big on presentation because you need something to put on your Instagram, don't order this. We also got the spaghetti cob polpette which I liked better. The tomato sauce tastes so fresh and sweet and the spaghetti noodles were cooked perfectly. The meatballs were also delicious! I would recommend this. We ended with the Pana cotta and a shot of limoncello. I personally didn't like the sauce with the Pana Cotta, it was a bit too tart but the rest was great. A man sitting next to us got a pasta dish served in a bag and poured at the table.... I REALLY want to come back and try this out. The service is friendly and quick. If you want real Italian food with a family feel, I absolutely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Came here on someone's recommendation that the food was good but little else. I can confirm this to be accurate. I walked up at 11:56am to ask if they were open ahead of meeting my friend. The man did not look up but said, 'in a few minutes' half under his breath. I might have taken this differently if he bothered to greet me, or even make eye contact but as it was, he continued to set the tables inside, while a row of 15 tables were already set and begging for company just outside. If I hadn't already agreed on the place with my friend, I would have moved on. When my friend arrived at 5 past, we asked for seats outdoors, and a woman brusquely pointed us to one at the far end and said we could have it for an hour and a half. We took it gratefully and were brought water glasses shortly after with some olives and cheese. We put in an order for spaghetti vongole and linguine alfredo with another dour server who did not offer a smile in the brief interaction we had. The food came quickly and was indeed delicious but not anything all that special. They sprinkled pepper on the dishes with a look of contempt. From there we enjoyed our meal in peace and at the hour, asked for our bill. The total came to \u00a324 which included a service charge - I chuckled at the presumption and coughed it up to cover the olives and cheese offering. The place was indeed buzzy with activity - not sure if this was largely due to the beautiful weather out or if this was actually a favorite for regular patrons. Either way, I would not recommend it and would suggest you keep on down Lambs Conduit for other places of business that will welcome you appropriately.",

As soon as you walk through the door, the interior is lively, full of people laughing and talking, and you get a blast of wonderful aromas. It's like an Italian wedding, in the best of ways. Best of all, you can hear people inside speaking in Italian (both the customers and staff), which means you're in for the real deal! The staff are very accommodating, so that's a nice touch also.The menu is rather touristy (i.e., mostly common dishes like spaghetti with clams, penne arrabbiata, etc.), but everything looks to be done well even if it's not super unique. The portions are fairly large, but you'll have a tough time stopping when you're full. For the cannelloni, both the tomato and bechamel were quite good by themselves, and just elevated to a whole new level together. Several good options for wine that are all reasonably priced.I would definitely recommend going here. It's not one of the \"cool\" restaurants in Covent Garden, but it's fun and the food is solid.",

We walked past all the trendier and hipper places to come across this little place - actually, it's not all that little as they cram them in downstairs too and some diners even braved the winter cold to sit outside (under heaters).There used to be a fair few of these traditional Italian restaurants all over London, run by families and serving honest home style dishes. Ciao Bella is one of the few left and draws in a good crowd.The flipside are large groups of office workers who come here after work. We ended up next to a group of loud and drunk men who didn't even apologise when they spilled their red wine all over my friend. All saved by the caring staff and you can't blame a restaurant for its rowdy clientele.Recommended if you are in need of some proper comfort food - I'll definitely be back, my penne arrabbiata was cooked to perfection.",

Our table was right in the middle of the busy restaurant with only 2 inches, no exaggeration, 2 inches on either side of our table from the ones next to us. We were sandwiched in between two other couples. The closeness of the tables made it very awkward and difficult to have a conversation with my partner.I had barely opened the menu when a waiter appeared to ask what we wanted to drink. I said we hadn't had time to look yet and asked for some water for the table in the meantime.Within a minute a different waiter had appeared at to ask the same question. We told them we had just placed an order for water with one of their colleagues.Within a few further minutes (before I had finished reading their 2-page menu) a different waiter arrived to ask us what we would like to eat. We ordered some pasta dishes, and two drinks.Within a minute the drinks arrived, and within 5 the food arrived suspiciously quickly. We ate, and I had barely put my cutlery down when the plates were whisked away and we were presented with the desert menu.Deciding we didn't want anything, we were told \"just the bill, yes?\". It duly arrived. I placed my card inside and within 30 seconds a different waiter yet again had arrived to take my payment.We left the restaurant within 37 minutes at 7.38pm. This was not the relaxing evening dinner that we had planned.The food was ok. I've been to a 100 Italian restaurants with a comparable menu and food quality but none with the same fast-food rush dining experience.",

All the food is pretty authentically Italian however they do let you put Parmesan on fish based pastas (punishable by lynching in Italy). There are wood oven pizzas, antipasto starters, mains and pasta (obviously). Not too many surprises here just really well done classics with a heap of garlic and flavour. There's no wonder that on Friday you often have to line. We shared three pastas: a salmon and broccoli cream base linguini, ricotta ravioli with a safe butter sauce and lastly, broccoli, anchovies and chilli spaghetti. All excellent. Big but not too huge that you feel guilty about wasting half the plate. We also shared a tiramisu which could have used a dash more coffee but was a nice way to finish. \u00a0The restaurant had some nice little touches with Parmesan, olives and bread sticks give to you as you sit down and all the staff had personality. Wine list was pretty reasonable and featured all the Italian comfort wines for decent prices. Next time I'll get into the grappa.",

They must have an arrangement with the pub next door, because the nice host managing the wait list encourages you to have a drink there while you wait and explains that he will come find you in the pub once your table is ready.Two drinks and 45 min later we were in.We sat downstairs at this bi-level establishment. Not fancy. Felt very family style. But in a fun and boisterous, not cozy and quaint, way. Once seated, we had to beg them to take our order (granted they are always very busy and customer service in London seems to be driven by the customer being proactive). But beyond worth it once the food arrives. I had the pesto. Portions are large, reasonably priced and of impeccable quality. We also downed 2 extremely reasonably priced bottles of above average house red. And all those amazing desserts in the pic? All mine! I wish...At least I got to sample them all. I prob could have devoured them all, but my friends would have killed me.",

The upstairs is entertained by a pianist while the downstairs seem a bit rowdier by comparison. We were seated downstairs but apart from being a bit loud, it was actually quite festive and upbeat. For starters, we shared a Margarita pizza that actually reminded me a bit of traditional New York pizza. My entr\u00e9e was the veal marsala, which I enjoyed very much. I was also happy that they were able to substitute the potatoes with garlic spinach. Just an extra note to the spinach - really loved the strong olive oil and garlic taste. For drinks, we had the house red. It was very good and at a great price. Finally, the desserts did not disappoint. The service was prompt and very friendly. I especially enjoyed the family feel of the restaurant.",

Everyone can hear your conversation, but that matter little when so much of it is about how good the food is.Let's be clear: Ciao Bella isn't setting the high-bar for Italian worldwide, but it is in the top 10% of London. It full deserve four stars. No more, no less since you can find better here and can certainly find worse. You can tell right from the olives they give you that there is something special, but not sublime going on here. The wine list, with many capable options, isn't going to blow any sommelier's mind, but he wouldn't scoff either.The food is served in healthy portions, is super tasty, and filling. There's lots of variety. The staff are prompt and courteous. Given the decent size of the place and it's more neighborhoody location, you're likely to get a table quickly at all but the busiest hours.All-in-all, a solid option I will be definitely returning for several times.",

On any given Saturday, there are 5-10 renditions of Happy Birthday, played by one of the regular pianists. The pianists are also open to other requests and are particularly keen on audience participation as long as you have a half decent voice.The service can be a little slow, but I like to think that this is due to the staff reading the situation and serving those who are in for the duration more slowly than those trying to grab a quick bite. If you mention that you are in a rush, they are usually accommodating.",

I've been there plenty of times in the past and will undoubtedly do so again in the future!

I can be a hearty eater at times and this was the first time in a while that I have been overwhelmed, we shared a starter of lovely garlic bread starter which we couldn't finish and when my pizza arrived it was awesome and tasted spot on.

Fabulous! Everything I've tried on the menu \u00a0has been delicious, especially the pizzas, but my favourite is the seafood spaghetti pasta that is cooked in the oven in a paper bag and then brought to your table and tipped with an aromatic flourish in to your bowl by an over the top Italian waiter. You do have to book ahead \u00a0Friday and Saturday, Sunday and even Thursday evenings. It does get very busy which is great if you're upstairs enjoying the hustle-bustle but not great if you end up downstairs which is a little claustrophobic and en route to the loos. If you meeting people, start your evening at the Lamb pub right next door, an award-winning delight of a boozer. \u00a0But my advice is to plan ahead and book a table outside for you and your friends to while a whole Sunday afternoon eating more carbs than is ever good for you and getting slowly drunk on red wine and the inevitable Grappas.",
