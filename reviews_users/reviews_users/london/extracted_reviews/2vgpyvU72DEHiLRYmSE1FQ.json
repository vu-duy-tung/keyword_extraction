However, bratwurst, their signature street fast food does make for a satisfying snackIn keeping with the fast food philosophy, the menu is simple - a choice of 3 sausages with traditional accompaniments. Prices are reasonableIn Germany, bratwurst would sometimes be a late night snack to assuage late night munchies. In London, it's an option for a cheap lunch but I wouldn't travel for oneAt this price, give it a try. What's the wurst that could happen?",

However, in August 2013, Herman ze German upped their game and expanded into Soho. The second location in Old Compton Street is much bigger than the original shop and also features a few new items on the menu alongside the known food and drinks offerings that include great products like fritz-kola from Hamburg.With more space, the new location offers a different experience that goes far beyond the take-away snack appeal of the first location. It even features a toilet downstairs, and when I was there I could listen to funny sounds from the German version of Adventures of the Gummi Bears. That alone should be reason enough to come back.If you like hot dog, meat balls, schnitzel and fries, Herman ze German is a restaurant you should not miss.",

I love sauerkraut and this one wasn't too bad either! HOWEVER, the price is a bit over the top. Maybe it was the beers that did the damage, but I wasn't full, nor was I interested in paying 2GBP for a larger sausage which they tried to up sell. I don't know - I certainly won't be back if I'm in Soho. I wish the price was a little less, or the portions would be bigger. Maybe I'm being greedy - but I hope that I'm not the only one that thinks along these lines...",

We get the tube from Hyde Park Corner to Leicester Square and walk through China Town to get here, all during our precious lunch hour. The food is that good!If you're veggie, this is one of the few places you're going to get a realistic (read meaty) hot dog that isn't full of potato, sweetcorn and pea's, it's absolutely brilliant. The chips are crispy and on point every time and the condiments and drinks (Fritz Kola) are tasty (though drinks are expensive).My real gripe, and I really hope HzG read this review, is the stock levels of your veggie sausages. On three separate occasions now I've made this trek of a journey to be told \"Ohh, we've just ran out\" which is INFURIATING when we've rode the tube and looked forward to it the entire way.I'm not sure what the problem with the Veggie Wurst is, but it never happens with the regular Wurst, but regardless, every time it happens, five or six of us then leave and go to GBK on Frith Street. You're losing a fortune.So, lovely place, meaty dogs look amazing, veggie dogs I can vouch for, but buy a bloody chest freezer or something to keep the veggie's happy, and i'll up the star rating considerably!",

The chain needs to review how the veggie sausages are being cooked and improve the end result. My husband who orders the meat version says the meat version is great on the contrary. When ordering toppings- the crispy onions are free which is great. Good selection of German beers and soft drinks and seating inside is good.",

    "text": "tl;dr get the fries, no matter what you do.No, seriously, I enjoy the hot dogs (I find them a little salty, but I'm going to try to avoid a double entendre...) but it's the fries I crave from good ol' HZG. They're crispy, they're crunchy, they're savoury, they're just. Ugh, now I'm craving them.Herman's got the market cornered on sausages in Soho (nah, I'm just gonna go there), at least as far as the edible variety go (you're welcome). They offer a surprisingly nice selection of proper dogs & sausages that remind me of the sort I grew up with in Central Europe in the early 80s (ok I was tiny, but what kid isn't a hotdog connoisseur), before things got heckin' overprocessed. HZG's meat is tasty, and you want it in your mouth. I can't compare to 'real' currywurst because I'm always a bit sketched by stalls, but HZG's curry on its own merits is okay. Okay as in I'll enjoy it once a year and then remind myself the curry is too sharply tomato-y (without anything to balance it), too heavy on the curry powder (read along with me: I love actual curry, and I know this is not meant to be that, but y'all need to step back from the shaky can), and not quite umami-heavy to balance the sausage. Now, maybe if you get the extra-nuclear variety you'll be too busy dealing with hellfire to care, but in the more modest heat levels I find there's just a lack in cohesion. Which is fine! It really is. I bet this stuff is fab for nursing your hangover.Verdict: You're paying for the location, because the amount of nosh you get for the price is only 'eh', even for Soho, considering this is properly fast food. The food is okay, but nothing will wow you. Get some fries, though. And get me some fries, while you're at it.",

We had the Bratwurst and Bratwurst on a bun, and was surprised by the good quality sausage and the sauce. Good atmosphere and was very busy on Saturday night. Disappointed that they ran out of fries that night. Overall recommend this place for a great bite and good quality German sausage!",

Served with the \"burner\" sauce to spice things up, since the \"hot\" sauce isn't really up to its namesake, and topped with freshly sprinkled crispy onion particles for free; it made for a sehr lecker Deutsche meal. The W\u00fcrste are of fine quality and seem authentic, while ordering at the counter and friendly staff make the whole experience very efficient indeed.The decor is decidedly German with a hint of hipster which makes for a pleasant atmosphere for a quick meal. The synthpop Lederhosen music, on the other hand, could have come from any decade and was on the brink of unpleasant.The price seemed a little steeper than I remembered last, but there is still value for money.",

As I had an hour to spare whilst waiting on friends, I decided to give is a go yesterday.The interior is pretty basic, with wooden bench tables and bench chairs, with bare walls broken up with a bit of neon signage. The counter is at the far end, with again a basic mix of food choices. On my visit they were out of Curry Wurst and also out of cheese (not a good sign for early on a Saturday evening).I felt like a lite option (It's not the best place for that really). I went for the Wurst and Salad. I opted for the Guest Wurst, which was a mixture of beef, pork and garlic. I was really pleased as the wurst was really tasty. It came with ample salad. The salad also included small pieces of apple, which gave it a nice twist.The staff were very pleasant, although food seems to be the main driver here, and not service. I will definately come back, as I was to try the Chilli Wurst and the Curry Wurst. If you are looking for a fast food outlet, it a great change from a burger or burrito outlet. I'd say give it a go!",

As well as the dead giveaway name the menu exudes German - schnitzel, bratwurst, sauerkraut and German beers. \u00a0Sausages (of which there are 3 choices all made in Germany) are either served in a bun, with a salad or with chips however there are a few combo deals; hotdog, chips & drink or hotdog with a few chips. I went for the ze Wild Bock Roll; bockwurst (smoky pork), curry sauce (you can chose the heat), crispy onions, mayo and a few chips. For \u00a36 I was very impressed - massive sausage, nice bun, delicious crispy onions, a tasty curry sauce (I went for mild as I am a bit of a wuss) and chips with a great curry seasoning which I was also chuffed with! With Herman ze German, a hot dog isn't just a hot dog - they definitely are the best I have had.",

The schnitzel itself for was very tender and had great flavours. It was a bit thicker than your regular German schnitzel but was still very delicious. The salad was a good balance of different greens, cucumber and some apple type thing which I loved! Service was average, friendly but not very talkative. You order up at the bar and then they bring your food over. The decor is pretty cool. I like the meat grinders hanging around the walls. Toilets were downstairs and were clean and tidy.",

There is also a dining area on street level as well as outside seats.Their soft drinks were all German and I got to try Fritz-Kola here for the first time but it wasn't to my pallet and there were no American alternatives available.I wouldn't really recommend this for its wheelchair access either.",
