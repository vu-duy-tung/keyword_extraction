I used to work opposite the restaurant on Heddon Street and regularly went there for lunches and after-work drinks, so can say with strong conviction that it is impossible to get served and eat one course in under an hour. Even getting a drink can cause problems as none of the waiting staff seem to want to serve you.I love the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and its adjoining cafe/bar but i always leave extremely aggravated and late. They do an absolutely amazing lunch deal for \u00a36.95 where you can choose from a selection of main courses (the hummous, chicken and roasted pepper wraps are amazing) salad, soft drink and mint tea. It is very good value but because it is made fresh (and because they don't take your order for twenty minutes) it takes a good 75 minutes to finish.They do a mean mojito and if you are lucky enough to get a table outside in the Summer, it is a perfect place to people watch on Heddon Street.",

It is a small intimate venue, very dark with a moroccan theme; lots of low tables and cushions. The music changes dependant on the evening and the time of the evening so it may be best to check before you decide to give this place I go. I prefer to go when there is a house DJ on the decks (Simon Lawrence and Kosmetiq often play here) but I know there is a great mix of other music throughout the week. The club is supposed to be for members only but if you go before 11pm I am sure you will be admitted. They are very fussy who they allow in so make sure you look the part! A great place to start the evenig off.",

It's a pretty & atmospheric place, both inside & outside on the climber-screened terrace area, & the staff were fine, but the food (from the all-day 'tapas'-style menu as we were there mid-afternoon) was less than mediocre. Portions were really tiny, & food was dried-out & under-seasoned. Carrot & orange salad is possibly my favourite Moroccan salad dish but this fell short of all other versions I've had in the past. The little cheese briouats were pleasant, but I expected more. What is meant to be a pioneering restaurant serves food of inferior quality to a bog-standard roadside cafe in Morocco!",

The greeter and seater was very good so we were expecting a fab evening. Alas, though ripe with promise, this was not to be. Waiting staff were snooty and quite obnoxious. Food (whilst tasty) was very expensive for what you got. Main dishes (starting at \u00a317 for vegetarian couscous) are served without any couscous (or potatoes for the tagine option). Couscous or potatoes will set you back a further \u00a34 so at more than \u00a320 for your main dish ..... Sorry guys, but I'm voting with my feet and my wallet on this one.",

We went there to meet with a former colleague on a sunny afternoon. We sat on the low tables outside which has nice atmosphere (beware: we only got the table after committing to eat something). There are a lot of moroccan tapas to choose from and with a 3 tapas/5 tapas offer with free of choice it doesn't set you back too much. The food was without exception good and perfect to accompany the afternoon beer/ wine. As always if the company is nice, you tend to see all other things a bit more mellow. I would say beer and wine are average. The staff is generally very friendly and didn't start an argument when they brought the wrong tapas :)",

The place is gorgeous! Unfortunately, our late afternoon lunch was ruined by some of the worse (SLOW, inattentive, etc.) service I've had in a very long time. So disappointing too because it impacted our overall experience and over-shadowed their fantastic food. 5 stars for food (aubergine and briouats appetizers / chicken couscous and lamb meatball tangien entrees) and 1 star (really, 0 stars) for the service. Too bad!",

However ambience and decor is authentic and lively and acoustics are good to have a group and still hear a conversation.

The food was relatively nice (although hot to the point of burning the tongue!), however the service we received was disappointing. A waitress repeatedly tried to take my starter away despite me telling her (very politely) that I hadn't finished. She even seemed annoyed that I hadn't eaten quickly enough! A number of the sides we ordered didn't arrive until mid-way through the main course, and we were eventually asked to move outside to enjoy the cocktails we had already ordered to free up the table, which would have been fine had we not been rained on through the canopy. Given the pricing this poor service did detract somewhat from the experience, and I wouldn't return in a hurry. However, if you do visit I thoroughly recommend informing the waiting staff of any upcoming birthdays in your group - without giving away too much, the \"celebration\" experience is rather spectacular!",

I did adore the glassware however with the thick stems and bell-like shape up top- Cakes: way too sweet for me but nice presentation with the 4 tiers of small platesLowlights:- Seating for taller individuals: they weren't too comfortable as there wasn't much space for their legs - Restroom walk: down dark, windy stairsHad a really fun night here and would be happy to go back.",

    "text": "Short Review: Beautiful restaurant & caf\u00e9 area, stunning decor with good service. Go for brunch/lunch over dinner; book a week in advance for brunch (its popular). Order anything (recommend 'London to Marrakesh') and enjoy yourselves! Food is great, dessert is delicious. Wine dramatically overpriced, grab a cocktail. Mint tea over coffee, and if you are after shisha save yourself \u00a310-15 and walk to Edgware Road. Great for a weekend day-time date.Longer Review: + Caf\u00e9: Really cool spot. \u00a0The afternoon lunch is great value for \u00a322pp to be honest, as the food and pastries are top notch (can see the menu on their website). Great spot for meeting friends or a casual weekend date.+ Lunch (in restaurant area): Great value for money at \u00a319pp for 3 courses, and nearly the same as the dinner menu. Portions are good size, restaurant is bright and bustling, and you can really see the beauty of the decor. Outside is great in summer.+ Brunch: I come regularly for the brunch, and for good reason- its amazing. You could have everything off the menu and want to try even more. I think their 'London to Marrakesh' set menu is a winner, and a nice way to start a fushion boozy brunch. Again, a GREAT choice for a weekend date if you want to impress. Dinner: Mixed bag for me, and did this last night (22/02/2015). Found the experience very relaxing, though the lighting a bit too dark on the outer ring of tables, my partner and I had to put the menus under the table lamp (no, we don't wear glasses :) ). + Houmous and Crispy Gambas (Prawns) to start; both utterly delicious to start with, and the bread with the houmous was mixed varieties of fresh warm yumminess. Also, I hate prawns, but I loved these. On the servers recommendation (whom may I say, are excellent) we had the Cous Cous Mechoui for two; slow charcoal roasted whole lamb was delicious and tender; cous cous was light and fluffy; but I wasn't blown away by the vegetable broth. Portion was MASSIVE, we thought we'd need to be wheeled away. It serves 2 extremely hungry 6ft+ men, or 3 normal people :D That said, I'm not sure it was worth \u00a331 each (\u00a362).+ Refills of mint tea was great (fragrant and sweet), but the coffee should be better quality for \u00a32.75 in a high-end establishment, or ideally 'authentic' Maghrebian coffee, given the focus everywhere else on the menu for high-end authentic food. Whats wrong with doing a spiced Moroccan coffee?- I found the wine selection EXTREMELY overpriced, and really that is my only true complaint. I like wine, I don't mind paying for it, but the Marius Chapoutier (a blend) is on the menu at \u00a329 a bottle, whereas I can buy it in any wine store for approx \u00a37 including sales tax. Similarly, my 'go-to' grape variety of Getwurtztraminer (which is an excellent pairing for the heavier and spicier food), is down as an Italian varietal for \u00a337 ( I can't understand not going with a true Alsace grape personally), whereas the same bottle is \u00a310 in wine stores. I understand the wine markup model, my family are restaurant owners, but even I think this is a bit extreme, and lends to a feeling that its all a bit overpriced. The entire bill for 2people came to \u00a3128-\u00a325 'Family' promo = \u00a3103.Credit to Momo's they do regular promos of \u00a325 off dinner, and it helps. But they excel in the day, and I think they know. :)",

    "text": "Momo is as cute as its name suggests and is definitely one of the prettiest dining experiences I have had. I went for dinner and enjoyed the ambiance of the eastern style lighting and decor. Momo is about atmosphere and feeling good to be there. I recommend a reservation because it can be very crowded on weekends and you may not get a seating otherwise. Even though we had reservations when we went, they had lost it and could not find our names anywhere. They decided that since it was their fault they would try to find us a table and in perhaps ten minutes we were seated.The Moroccan food at Momo is well-cooked and good quality. I enjoyed it but unlike the rest of my table who were loving it, I felt something was missing. Everything was certainly made with a skilled hand and my lamb couscous was tender and perfectly falling off the bone, yet I felt it could have had more flavour, more something that would make me love it. It was good but not great; so close!The appetisers were had were the cheese briouat with mint, which was good and the chicken bourek which was forgettable. The best was the zaalouk which was a lightly spiced aubergine dip which went really well with Momo's yummy bread, I'd recommend that. I think Momo is more about ambiance, feeling exclusive and being in a nice environment than the food and it lives up to that. The food was fine and I did feel that I was having a special night out, so if you want atmosphere, it's a good place to go.",

As a main we had morrocon chicken for two. The size was large so we had enough to eat but i gotta say it was nothing that special. The chicken was grilled very good but something was missing.

The food is really good, we had some starters and few main courses to share, among others you need to try the gambas in the starters menu and the chicken cous cous. Service is a bit slow, so it is the right place for a relaxed dinner, not really a dinner on the go. All the waiters have a lovely French accent and are very polite though. We were four eating, with 3 starters, 3 mains, some desserts and wine we paid c.\u00a340 each, a fair price for me.Downstairs at night it becomes a Moroccan night club!",

Try to get seating on the sides with the couch seating as you might otherwise be seating on small Moroccan chairs which are interesting but not as comfy as the couch :)The food is interesting and flavorful.

My fianc\u00e9 and I were sat next to a very large group of people who had obviously been drinking heavily but from the moment we sat down continued to get extremely loud and obnoxious. The restaurant was full and due to the fact of an issue with the tube that night and having to push out our reservation we really just wanted to eat and get out of there. My fianc\u00e9 didn't even want to go there but after having a great meal and experience here about 15 years ago I thought after being in Italy for the past week it would be fun to have a different experience...Well we're were sat down next to an extremely loud group of about 12 women having a Birthday celebration whom were extremely loud which we just ignored because they were so drunk but than the restaurant turns up to the music extremely loud and the wait staff started dancing and singing at the table bringing a birthday cake to this table and this one woman who was clearly trashed started dancing right up against our table and just about knocked over a bottle on our table ....I raised my arm up to block her from hitting our table...we never complained as it was late and we just got wanted to finish our meal and get out of there. This extremely drunk woman starts taking our picture a few times (not sure why) but than makes a whole scene saying that my boyfriend has elbowed her or something...I think it was the manager for the night actually came up to our table to check and see if we were OK... Again at this point we just wanted to get our meal over with and get out of there. Thankfully the gentleman at the table next to us who were from the area just kept trying to keep us distracted and apologizing for the table of strangers as they were also in awe of the behavior and that the restaurant was allowing it. To top of the night the meal itself was horrible, neither one of us even finished our meal and the restaurant had the nerve to give us our $200 bill without even comping a drink for all of that chaos. The quality of this place is not what it used to be, although the woman who I believe was the manager for the night came over to check on us it didn't make up for such a horrible experience. I guess the other party must have been spending a lot of money so there experience was more important than the rest of the guests.I did receive a note when checking out of my hotel that the manager did call the next day to apologize but it was 6 am 2 days later and we were on our way back to NY.If you enjoy good food and a great dining experience do yourself a favor and do not eat here!!!",

Had the rose mint tea and it's like sweetened mint tea with some rose scent added to it. Very aromatic and warming. Also had their pudding-like dessert which was also quite good.",

We had the tasting menu, which came with a number of taster starters and mains, including chickens, sausages, beef and vegetable dishes. Their couscous was phenomenal, which went nicely with all the dishes. I'm not a big fan of African food, but I enjoyed the experience this evening. Service was good, though not the best. Whilst the servers were prompt in bringing out our dishes and drinks, there was some confusion with the restaurant manager regarding payment, which was a bit annoying. Ambience was very nice -- authentic and spacious. A good way to introduce friends to the cuisine.",

We had a reservation for four people at 6:30pm and we got there a bit early so they let us in and told us we had the table for two hours, which was no problem.The drinks were good, food was excellent, and the service was just fine - very nice indeed. Also I liked the ambiance and it wasn't very noisy for a London restaurant - our group could talk freely and hear each other just fine! Also, the restaurant wasn't kidding about the two hours for the table. At ~8:25pm they came by and politely kicked us out (they really were nice about it!).I don't know that I would come back here unless I was in the area but overall I did enjoy the experience here. Try the Lamb Tagine - it's really good.",

    "text": "I have been to Momo three times now. Admittedly, this was many years ago. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and would often take my girl friend their on her birthday. The most disappointing thing for me was I would buy the cake which would cost about twenty pounds. The music would go louder and the staff do a bit of a dance and go to your table be serve you the slice of birthday cake. Nothing particular unique but I like it. On both occasions though I had walked out with out them giving me the renaming slices of cake. \u00a0When I approached the staff about this the last time and walked back in the response was you have to ask for it which instantly put me off this place and I never returned after that. What made the situation worse is the name on the top of the cake slice was another name so they mixed my cake with another table and my girl friend noticed. When I'm paying about twenty pounds for a cake, Apart from that the food is excellent. I also recommended my sister to go but she did not like service and thought it was rushed and was with a group and had to rush their deserts to free up seats. She has never been back either. She Told me she was impressed with the good and atmosphere though. Same opinion as me but I wNted her to try it out because the restaurant has a lot still going for it if service could be improved. \u00a0They also had a nice tea place next door and on top of that a nice room to wait. Generally, what did it for me is the atmosphere of the place. It is just special and is different to most places in London and believe me when I say I like eating out and visiting nice restaurants. I plan to go back soon because I'd like to test the service a little more and see if they have changed. For this reason, this is not a fair review because I have not been their for many years but I wanted to share my views all the same. 3 stars but 2.5 more accurate",

I love Morrocan cuisine, and the ambience of this place felt somewhat plesant too.They refused to sit us inside, so had to make do with a cold outside, and also they refused to switch the heating on! You cannot sit outside to eat in Winter and not provide warmth, how ridiculous!! It took the waiter 5 attempts being told to bring the menu and another 30 minutes for him to come over and take our food order.Once the food did arrive, it all looked nice but tasted awful!!! It was just so bland, there was abolsute no flavour in anything!!! Also its very overpriced too. Once i complained the waiter or the manager did not care, they just completely ignored us because it was an all girl group. Complained about them being sexist towards us, other people got served a lot quicker than we did, and the way they spoke to us was very unplesant. We stayed for shisha, what a mistake that was, again took 45 minutes for him to come over, bearing in mind this place is practically empty for lunch, then another 15 minutes for them to change the coal, definitely not worth the hassle!! Go to Tibits instead which is opposite. After not receiving the bill, after telling him a million and one times, we went inside and paid and left with a mouthful to the manager who again just blinked twice and didn't acknowledge what had just happened.The staff in this place are rude, the food is 0/10, they hate all female groups, sexist and also found them a bit racist too, to be honestSpend your money elsewhere!!",

Food is good, yes definitly good, but not extraordinary nothing that blew my mind and i am a big fan of moroccan food. Honestly a little dissapointed considering i had very high expectations from Chef Momo, famous moroccan chef in france, even had a cooking class with him in Marrakesh.Very beautiful restaurant. Cannot deny that. We manage tk seat outside, they had the heaters on, little oasis of Morocco just off Regents street. Have had shisha once there before - as the decor is ideallic it does make for a great shisha place, but wasnt able to just order mint tea and shisha, had to get a glass of alcohol. Its fine if thats what you want to do but again i wish i could have just had mint tea.",

We tried to spend a nice evening despite the date (13th of November when the 11th arrondissement of Paris and the Stade de France were attacked by terrorists). We shared a few starters between us. All of them were ok.As a main a few of us had the couscous mechoui which was a slow charcoal whole roasted lamb shoulder with authentic spices and ras el hanout spiced figs. The rest of us had the traditional chicken with preserved lemons, olives, onion compote and saffron. Both dishes were alright but not amazing. We didn't think we had enough sauce or couscous for the price we paid.Overall I didn't enjoy my experience at Momo. Maybe the condition were not the best but also the wine and food was overpriced. We had quite an expensive bill for something not that amazing.I didn't like the service either as our waiter was way too intrusive. Two of my friends liked that, but for the rest of us we were a bit annoyed.",
