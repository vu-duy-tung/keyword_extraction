A regular haunt during my first year in London, G & S is certainly different from your average restaurant/bar with gothic/metal interior. Garlic infused drinks and food are the order of the day (although you can get bottled beer without the cloves too!). Friendly staff, a nice dark and dingy underground bar, and cheap tapas too. I hadn't been there for 3 years until a last week and was pleased to see it hadn't changed a bit!",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Garlic and Shots for years, celebrated several birthdays there, and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places to go - either as a venue to spend the whole evening, as a way to start the evening off, or even a chance for that last-gasp nightcap.G&S is made up of three parts - the restaurant section you see when you walk in, an open seated area you at the back for smokers and/or diners, and the underground bar, playing rock and metal until the early hours, serving drinks only. The restaurant is certainly an excellent reason to visit Garlic & Shots - serving a range of garlic based dishes, from the best garlic bread in town (half a farmhouse loaf soaked in garlic butter, none of your dry, crispy, Pizza hut style garlic slices here), to the reknowned Vampire steak and Garlic burgers. While the feel of the venue is somewhat of a biker/rock bar, with posters adorning the walls while you eat listening to Alice In Chains, Johnny Cash and AC/DC, the quality of the food is excellent, and of a much higher calibre than initial expectations might suggest for such an establishment. Wine and beer can be served with your meal, although the selection isn't very wide reaching, I can recommend a bottle of the Calhungetta Merlot, especially with the meatier dishes. Do bear in mind though, when you sit in the front area, you will be expected to order food, not just drinks.The open area to the rear provides a chance for the smokers to sit with a drink, and maybe even some food, and is quite a good place to spend a summer evening, away from the bustle if Soho for a few hours.The downstairs bar is famous for three things - late opening, loud heavy metal, and the list of 101 shots, which, at roughly \u00a32.50 each, can provide an excellent start to an evening of excess. I firmly recommend, especially if it's your first time at G&S, to try a Bloodshot - a mixture of tomato juice, pepper, tobasco, chilliand vodka, this Bloody Mary on kerosene certainly opens the eyes a bit, it's a rite of passage for my friends and I. The dowwnstairs can get full at times, and if you're a group between four and eight, it's best to get there early and take over the bunker area to the back and left.So, don't believe all the reviews saying \"I went there once and it was too loud for my poor little ears and I don't like garlic anyway\" - this is a place to unleash your inner metaller, line the stomach before a night's drinking and dancing, or to take the hot rock chick you've been meaning to ask out for ages (just make sure she likes garlic first!).",

Amusing for the first two minutes, but listening to AC/DC while waiting for food is not really our thing. But we persevered, for the garlic.They were out of the fish we'd originally ordered, so I ended up getting a veggie burger while my companion ordered something else, we no longer remember what. They had almost no garlic flavor at all! The mashed potatoes were quite good, with roasted garlic, but what's unusual about that? The veggie burger was not particularly good in any way. And instead of garlic-infused food, I found that the food had lots of chili in it. Yes, they're both spicy, but there the similarity ends. The food was passable. The heavy metal theme was unpretentious, and probably great if you like that kind of thing. But there wasn't much garlic.",

Love that it's so cramped and tiny, that the only table they have is a coffin squeezed into a little alcove and, more importantly, i love their range of weird Scandinavian shots. Want a robot vodka? They have one. An electric one? Yep that's sorted. Need dialysis after visiting, probably! Okay it's all a bit Swedish goth but for a place to quickly run into, slam a drink or two and go it's great.

I can think of 10 better bars/pubs (I use bar and pub interchangably, and resent the distinction) in Ealing alone, and Ealing seems to shut down at 11pm. This is why it gets a '1' from me. The real rating is a '2'. Its an ok place, not bad if you need somewhere free to go late (as another reviewer has suggested), or if you want to pop in and out for a silly shot. But I wouldn't plan a night out around it. Luckily, I had some excellent company, and stayed in outside at the back where we could have been anywhere. Beerwise, your choices are overpriced bottles, or a 'garlic beer' which, despite being advertised in the beer garden, they are reluctant to serve to you unless you're having a meal. Don't lose any sleep about it though - its just a load of chopped garlic dropped into a small glass of carlsberg. The problem with this place is that it's trying to be an alternative/novelty bar, and a serious restaurant, simultaneously. Perhaps they would be better off going for one or the other, rather than trying to do both without doing either part justice. Or they could just change the name: as it is 'Garlic & Shots' gives the impression of a sense of humour found lacking inside. UPDATE: Ealing does shut down at 11pm. Some places are open late, up to 2am, but won't let you in past 11.",

It's not that they aren't friendly, but they have rules, and do enforce them. I.e. don't hold the door open as it gets cold quickly; don't drink in the front of the restaurant if you aren't eating; and NEVER ask them to change the music. Even if goth metal isn't your kind of music, you can escape from the creepy crypt bar downstairs, with a coffin for a table, to the bohemian garden out back, with huge heaters and an overhead canopy. I drank in the rain there last night, and it was quite romantic with the water thrashing down above us while we sat there warm and dry. The shots are amazing, the bloodshot in particular, which is essentially a very spicy Bloody Mary condensed into a shot. Please not, even if you don't drink or eat any, you will leave smelling of garlic. It's a good thing.",

    "text": "You can kind of imagine the brainstorming session which resulted in Garlic & Shots becoming a reality; a brief discussion of the various types of themed bars around London is followed by the question of how to bring something new and innovative to the as yet unnamed space purchased by the owners. A few ideas are thrown out by those around the table, 'how about a chocolate bar, where everything is made of chocolate, and the name is a pun?' 'oh or maybe a unicycle bar where all the servers ride around on unicycles and the tables are made of penny farthing wheels?'. The ideas flow out until a voice is heard from the corner. It's Alun, the resident vampire hunter, who has looked up from his time-consuming task of sharpening his stake and polishing his silver bullets to give forward his suggestion: 'a garlic bar. Where everything has garlic in it. Food. Drinks. Everything. Garlic. They can't get me there.' By this point the owners are tired, tipsy and sick of idiotic suggestions, and one of them is a tad scared of Alun, as you would be of a large man with flowing dark locks, a cloak and a penchant for stroking pointy objects and speaking in a low, menacing voice, and lo, Garlic & Shots was born. So maybe the garlic theme doesn't extend to everything in the place, as I've had many drinks here that left my breath, if not minty fresh, at least not filling the air with visible stench lines. The food does all have garlic in, and I've only tried the garlic bread which was amazing in a sort of blow your head off with garlic kind of way [forgive the repetition of the word garlic in this sentence by the way, it's slightly unavoidable given the topic]. There are lots of shots with the bulb [that's garlic again kids] which taste dreadful, so I'd give them a miss. The outside seating space in the back is much appreciated in the Summer and normally fairly lively even if inside is a bit quiet, and it makes a change from the garish bars along Old Compton Street or the proliferation of craggy old man pubs that seem to fill Soho. I just wish they'd gone for chocolate and shots instead. But then again I AM a woman, and feel the need to conform to gender stereotypes.",

The first room you enter is the dining/restaurant area. Not too many tables but the room is great and cozy. On every table there is a parsley pot and for those of you who wonder why? the parsley is there so you can eat it after you finish your meal. It helps you get rid of the garlic breath. \u00a0That's very thoughtful of them. The food is delicious - the steak and the potato gratin, omg! If you want to stay upstairs, you have to order food. If not, then you go downstairs and there you have the bar with 2 rooms- well one of them is more like a tomb, to be honest, with a very long table , shaped like a coffin. And then outside you have the beer garden with 8-9 tables (?). What I like about the garden bit is that they have heaters that turn on automatically. \u00a0So even if it's freezing outside you still feel a warm wave around you. I keep reading reviews about this place and how people actually ended up having their orders cancelled and asked to leave. Well...if you go to a death/black metal bar don't ask the staff to stop or change the music because you can't stand it anymore. Don't be a pain in the a** for the other customers who actually enjoy the place and the music. In the restaurant area you can barely hear the music and it's nothing compared to the music downstairs. If you are going to be patronising the staff will not stand that. Everytime I go there I am greeted by the manager and the waitress, downstairs I have absolutely no problem, everybody is welcoming, they don't make you feel left out if you're not a metal head or intimidate you. Everybody's friendly and helpful. I totally recommend it for garlic lovers, shot addicts, metal lovers and for people who fancy something out of the ordinary. Give it a shot. Literally :P",

I haven't ever eaten in the restaurant (and probably never will) but I've drunk in the downstairs bar many times and I love it! It's my go to place for whenever friends are in London and it's always really good fun.I love garlic, love drinking, love the music and love Scandi barmaids who look at me like they hate me. This is my kind of bar! I'm not a big shot drinker (their menu has 101), I usually drink beer, but I used to enjoy the Bloodshot (number 1), I tried it recently and it's just too watery, like a really crap diluted bloody mary. My new favourite is the Ryggskott - Achin' Back (it's number 14), but it's lethal! I'll keep coming back.",

And there is an outside garden area with tables. And then there's the lower bar that has a few tables, dimmed lighting and metal music blasting. The owners are really smart in their layout design. The ability \u00a0to have various types of people enjoy their establishment at once. Because you see you have to order food if you want to sit up front so that makes all the metal loving barflies go downstairs for drinks. sneaky sneaky.I don't particularly listen to metal but it was an enjoyable evening none the less. Didn't feel out of place or intimidated at all downstairs.Ordered bottles of san miguel and blood shots (spicy tomato juice and garlic infused vodka I'm guessing by taste alone). Although you can't just drink upstairs you CAN order food downstairs. I walked up and ordered potato skins for us. And they really were mostly just the skin of the potato! usually its chips with skins on them but they took the description real literal here. Nevertheless it was tasty and garlic-y and had spicy ketchup and garlic mayonnaise for dipping. yum!",

    "text": "Two of my good girlfriends are obsessed (that's putting it lightly!) with garlic, and were eager to come to Garlic & Shots, so I tagged along. I'd read about this place in my Time Out London Top 1000 things to do, so I prepared for the Gothic / Vampire feel going on in this place. Yeah, it was pretty dark and coffin-like cramped. I just have one question though, aren't vampires supposed to be repelled by garlic? Seems like a serious fatal flaw in the decor if that's the case. Everything is garlic, well most anyway! \u00a0I, of course, got garlic bread (which was some of the best garlic bread I've ever had), and on the recommendation of the waitress, the 'Garlic Pops', which were interesting to say the least (kind've like popcorn shrimp, but with garlic). My friends got the mussels (drenched to perfection with butter and garlic) and the Garlic burger (served with Garlic dressing, natch). Another thing Garlic & Shots is known for is the 101 shots, and, as you can imagine, some of them are garlic inspired. I went for their 'No 1 shot', the Blood shot which was vodka, tomato, garlic, chili and spices. So very close to a Bloody Mary (which I adeeer)!And to end your evening, Garlic & Shots are gracious enough to offer pots of parsley to help rid you of your garlic breath.A little factoid: garlic is exceedingly good for your health, among which it's been proven to lower cholesterol and blood pressure! So maybe Garlic & Shots is on to something?",

All 2-tops. And the garden in the back is one row of picnic tables plus one more small seating area up a few steps. It doesn't really matter, but words like \"dungeon\" and \"garden\" and \"upstairs\" make it seem a bit more mystical than reality. \u00a0 And the space certainly is not intimidating: while the menu and music says \"metal bar\", the atmosphere most definitely does not, especially if you've ever been in an actual, dive-y metal bar. \u00a0It's perfectly cozy, in my experience, and as the whole thing is a gimmick, really, no one there is taking themselves too seriously (and if they are, you shouldn't take them seriously enough for it to bother you). That being said, it is still a cool, fairly trashy (downstairs+garden, mostly) place to get that gimmicky drink. The house shot is absolutely disgusting, but in a worthwhile way (a shot with chunks of garlic and chili is really difficult to get down, but the flavor is tasty and hey, it's the experience). They have two kinds of beer- Stella & San Miguel. \u00a0Three shots+three beers=\u00a318.Ultimately, I'd recommend it as a great stop on a drinking tour or as a place to pop-in and throw one back in the midst of other Soho activities. It'd be hard to forget and worth smiles in the future.",

It's a crypt-like metal bar in the basement and I adore it. We always stop in here for a few rounds when we're in Soho. It's a nice change from the rest of the area.",

    "text": "Garlic & Shots is the sort of place people are either going to love or hate. In order to love it you have to firstly enjoy garlic (check), secondly be the sort that likes loud metal music (double check) and thirdly doesn't mind a bit of rock and roll attitude from the staff and customers (triple check). So, I am the sort of person that loves it.There are three parts of the venue. There is the small and cosy restaurant portion where you can order all sorts of dishes as long as they heavily feature garlic. Just don't try to order a diet cola because they only do the full fat variety.Then there is the beer garden out back where you can sip your shots and beer at a more leisurely pace. This is outside,as you would probably expect from the word 'garden'. Which can mean that in the summer it is a great place to enjoy a London evening but in the cold or the rain it can be a bit of a challenge. Thirdly, down a steep set of stairs is the small bar area where you can listen to ear splitting death and black metal while you try not to stick too much to the floor.The prices are average, the food is good (if you like garlic!) and the shots are powerful. Just don't go if you can't take a bit of tattoos and attitude. If you can't it just isn't going to be the place for you.",

There was with a corner bar staffed by an indifferent chick who looked like she'd have preferred staring at nothing than to have our business. \u00a0Again, we pushed past to descend into what must have once been a wine cellar we labelled a coffin, a cell, a dark hole in the bowels of London, lit only by tea candles and what may have been glowing algae. \u00a0 We proceeded to pound the table in a lewd and raucous Scottish drinking song, downing blood shots tasting of mexican salsa, until the hooded-eyed bartender came into our hole and told us we were reverberating, \u00a0from twenty feet underground, all the way up to the snooty patrons of the boring room above, and could we quit it, please? \u00a0There was something about the novelty of feeling buried alive as we drank, and we made a good time of it, but otherwise it is hard to recommend this place.",

Everything on the menu is pretty awesome and all freshly prepared. They have a great variety of drinks and a menu with 101 different shots on it! Shot wise I'd recommend the Harley Davidson Oil or the Paul Morning Shooter, both pack a punch. The staff are always really friendly, welcoming , well mannered and always on hand when needed.

They serve 101 types of shot - which were a lot of fun, along with bottled beers and wine. We also tried the garlic beer - but as another reviewer mentioned this is just a glass of normal beer with chopped garlic added. A few people tried it but couldn't bear to drink more than a sip. In terms of shots I tried the bloodshot (tomato, garlic, chilli and vodka), chilli vodka (pretty spicy as expected), and instant margarita (all the ingredients of a margarita in a shot glass). The shots are \u00a32.50 each - although don't try and order from the bar at the front of the restaurant as I did and got told off. Food wise, as a starter the garlic bread was the probably the best I've ever had. The main dishes however were a major disappointment. The Swedish/American influenced dishes such as the garlic burger, or Swedish sausage with garlic mash would have been pretty tasteless were it not for the vast amount garlic added to every part of the dish. One of our party was so disgusted with his main the he took one bite and left the rest. The waitresses and other members of staff seemed really unfriendly and we didn't feel welcome. We managed to rack up a \u00a340 bill each - but I didn't feel we got a great deal for this so would say it represented poor value for money. We had been considering heading to the downstairs Goth bar afterwards, but after finishing the meal decided we really didn't feel like staying any longer. I might go there again for a shot or a few drinks, but not for food.",

The wait for food was extremely long (40 minutes since we ordered), there was only one waitress serving the entire floor and despite her cheerful attitude there simply wasn't enough staff in the front room. Maybe at least notifying us with recognition of the delay in serving the food would be appreciated.The fried garlic pops were highlight of the night, we were at first told they might not be available which would really be quite a shame because that was the only garlicky food amongst what we have ordered. The garlic bread was served in half a loaf which was a lot, with not much garlic flavour in it, needless to say the burger did not consist of garlic at all and it was well done throughout the whole piece of meat. Thankfully the sauces for the burger were not bad to compensate for the dryness of the burger, but after such a long wait a dried burger and a bland loaf of bread really was a disappointment.",

    "text": "Love, love, love this place. In fact the only thing I don't love about it are the toilets. They're pretty grim which is pretty bad for an eatery. Oh and the steep stairs because they aren't great if you're there taking advantage of the extensive shot list (101 shots!). On the first floor you have the restaurant - reservations are almost always necessary although if it's early a small group may get lucky with a walk in. The food is delicious - and it all contains garlic. I highly recommend the chicken quesadiila - the portion is generous and it's a really flavourful, garlicky, spicy twist on Mexican. The marinade and sauce in the dish (and a few others on the menu) features the Bloodshot - the bars most renowned Bloody Mary like shot. The corn tortillas topped with halloumi are fantastic for a lighter bite. And you have to have a side of the garlic bread - not only is it amazing, it's basically half a loaf!If you miss out on a table in the restaurant, they will serve bar food (including the garlic bread!) to the basement 'Vampire Bar'.It's a good bar - dark, dingy and with excellent music of the heavier persuasion. I recommend getting their early to try to get the table in the crypt - a little out of the way cave like booth.Drinks options can be limited - beer choices are very few and soft drinks are limited to Coke (full fat) and Sprite.",

    "text": "A friend took me here after bragging about it for months on end and I was not disappointed. The name is pretty self explanatory and their menu is pretty much garlic food and 101 different shots. It's a restaurant upstairs and an atmospheric dive bar downstairs, all my favourite things in one place! We came for dinner and I had the deep fried halloumi and we shared a garlic bread. I thought I should go for the garlic beer to really try the essence of the place! It was all pretty delicious though those last two mouthfuls of beer were possibly a bit strong for my liking! 4/5 stars purely because the waiter was rather disorganised with his seating and we were moved twice and hurried along at the end of our meal. The 2nd time we were moved was completely unnecessary too. Only mildly frustrating.",

    "text": "I happened to chance upon this place whilst out drinking in Soho with three tipsy and very hangry men. We were looking for somewhere to eat and as this place served burgers and looked quieter than the GBK next door (my companions required burgers) we decided to come here. I had also seen this reviewed on Yelp so thought it would be a good shout seeing as I loved garlic!Okay so the concept is strange but I liked it. Straightaway we opted for a shot - however we all chose a shot for the person sitting diagonally across from us which, in my opinion, made things fun! My first shot was a 'Bombay Cooler Shooter' which consisted of gin, peach and cranberry which was quite pleasant. I can't speak for the others however they seemed able to swallow theirs down!We then decided to order food. The three boys had burgers, I opted for the Swedish smoked sausage and mash. This was served with a garlic mash, raw red onions, red cabbage and capers with a smear of whole grain mustard. The mash and the sausage were good - especially the mash! I love garlic mash! I don't really like the other stuff so I just left it, however having been to Scandinavia before, I expected it. The boys enjoyed their burgers which was good. The food was okay, I just felt a bit deflated after eating it, especially as I'd heard and read so much about it!After food, we went for a second round of shots. I have no idea what was in the second one as again, one of my companions chose mine but it wasn't too bad! I guessed that it had J\u00e4ger in it. I got one of my dinner companions a shot which had tequila, sambuca and Tabasco in it and I have never seen a grown man writhe in pain like that before! Definitely the best choice for him! Overall it was a pleasant experience although the toilets are pretty grim! Next time I might just go to the underground bar for shots and give the food a miss.",

While it looks like an average bar on the outside, if you go down the stairs you will discover a dark gothic vault type room. That is where you need to be. There's not much space but if you are lucky enough to get a table just sit down and pick some shots. They are about \u00a33 and they are quite strong. I recommend stopping there for a few shots before continuing your night out on the town. It is something unusual to take your friends to as even if they are not into that type of music and decor they will appreciate how unusual it looks.",

    "text": "What is Garlic & Shots? Well, it's a place that serves shots and most of them have some degree of garlic in them. And when I say they serve shots, it's pretty much all they do and damn do they have a lot of them. They are bloody potent and you are just as likely to fall in love with the next shot or want to empty the contents of your stomach all over the bar. It's great for a fun night of drinking and makes for one helluva of a hangover the next day.I went here with some new Yelp friends after an Elite event. We were already a bit buzzed and in no way ready for the night to end (despite it being around 9pm on a Wednesday). So at their suggestion, we camped out at the upstairs bar and proceeded to play a game. One at a time, we'd go up and buy a round, then everyone at the table would have to take the shot before finding out what it was. Needless to say, we started off nice and easy with some tasty ones but as the night progressed our evil streaks came out. I was impressed that no one lost it (guess we're a competitive bunch) and even more impressed (and slightly scared) at what goes on in the minds of the bartenders who created some of the foul concoctions we tried.I'd love to tell you what the shots were, but that would deprive you of a chance to experience it yourself. So go there, pick a bottle at random and good luck. Think of it like Bertie Bott's every flavour jelly beans...if Harry Potter could do it then so can you!",
