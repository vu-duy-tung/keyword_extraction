The staff is very helpful and they are happy to give you a taste before you buy. The \"morbier\" I bought there was the best ever and not even that expensive. On top of the cheese, you can also find great charcuterie, fresh fruits, homemade cakes or fresh eggs. Love it!!!",

For breakfast I normally go for the Boiled Egg and soldiers-scrumptious! Very disappointed however the last time I went there as it was very very busy and we missed the breakfast slot. That said we queued and opted for the lunch menu instead. Not really fancying the heavy food choices we both opted for one of their tarts. Very very tasty but the portion size was very measley especially at \u00a38 a serving. I would go back from my boiled eggs and soldiers but not for the lunch as I think it's a bit pricey for what it is. That's a bit of a shame so maybe brush up on your portion sizes please!",

Of course the place is about cheese and the section of the shop dedicated to cheese is quite spectacular and worth the visit, but La Fromagerie more than that. The decor is charming, quite busy and full of stuff but looking good, the place has a sense of authenticity and feels quite unique, and the products (mainly food delicatessen, both salty and sweet) look and taste good. La Fromagerie is also a great place for a simple lunch with friends or family. We had a wonderful Italian waitress who was extremely friendly and took great care of our table and 2 little girls in particular. I had the rabbit stwe which was excellent (the most expensive plate on the menu at \u00a313) and a glass of very good Italian Barolo which was recommended. Note that the service was great (in our case) while this is one of the few places in London where you don't get the optional 12% service charge included so service charge is really up to you. Any course on the menu is available for take-away , something that must be pretty popular with the locals We will be back during another visit of the charming and central Maryleborne Village",

    "text": "I rarely get up to Marylebone but when I do I always seem to end up at La Fromagerie. What a charming little place, like a restaurant with a French accent if you know what I mean. La Fromagerie, as the name promises, is predominantly a cheese shop with an amazing cheese room, which you can also check out online (Online cheese room). I could not believe my eyes \u00a0they even have cheese from Austria! (they do deserve credit for this as you cannot say that Austria is exactly famous for its cheese) In the middle of all these great food stuff (olive oil to die for, delicious looking bread, chocolates etc..) there is a small attractive cafe/restaurant area with rustic wood tables and chairs. The menu is small but hits the spot and all the ingredients are top class. We had the vegetarian Antipasti Plate (8.95) with lovely humus and smoked aubergine puree which I have hardly eaten better. It came with sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, olives and tasty goat's cheese garnished with fresh leaves and herbs. We also shared the absolutely delicious House Dry Cured Beef Fillet (14.50), carpaccio with pecorino cheese, salad leaves/rocket and truffle oil. Very very nice indeed. please see alsohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  We were not quite sated yet and tried one of their cheeses which we had bought before in their cheese room. When we asked for knife and bread, they gave us the bread for free. How rare is this? We decided on a French goat's cheese called Banon which came wrapped in wine leaves and was perfectly ripe and melting and delightful. We were not planning on eating the whole thing actually but there was no holding us back La Fromagerie offers a good, fair-priced wine list. When we couldn't decide which wine to take, the waitress let us try different ones until we made up our mind. The service yes \u00a0they were lovely and attentive and helpful and the service charge was not included. That's when you like giving! So I hope I have convinced you that this is the perfect place for a unpretentious, relaxed and satisfactory meal. On the downside \u00a0I might just never try anything else in Marylebone",

While last time I sampled a few other menu items, nothing blew me away nearly as much as the cheese. \u00a0(So it's not just a creative name...)Walking through a veritable market of colours where fresh veggies and chocolates fill barrels and olive oils and peppers line the walls, you'll find a quaint little seating area in the back and it's almost like you're seated at a secret chef's table. Sit there long enough and you'll be treated to samples from the various deliciousness found around the shop! Word to the wise: probably not the best place for the faint of smelly-tolerance. \u00a0You can literally smell the dank moist of cheese sweat.

Whenever I go I have a cheese plate and I always try something new, I love the blurbs on the menu about where the cheeses have originated. Its all good. I often order two dishes and eat them both. One criticism. They can't really make coffee - so leave that for some where else.",

We ditched the hotel breakfast (OK, but nothing great) to eat here for breakfast instead. \u00a0I was served: a huge free range brown egg, nested in a lovely earthenware cup w. little cups of salt and ground pepper, GREAT toasted whole grain bread all on an earthenware plate. I ordered a cappuccino the entire thing was absolutely yummy and aesthetically pleasing. I could not keep my eyes off the shelves of lovely unique Les Grimauds ceramics from France (I purchased a big box of these) and the cheese room was filled with delights! I also discovered the delicious little artisanal french yogurts that I got completely hooked on! \u00a0O! if only there were a store such as this in either Brooklyn or St Louis where I live. \u00a0SAD ole me!The help is really great here and honestly I could eat here everyday. The other breakfast offerings I saw made my mouth drop open. \u00a0Its all great here!",

It's not to say we didn't have an ok meal. The butternut squash I had for lunch was DELICIOUS, and free of cream which is increasingly rare. Very rich, nice toasted pumpkin seeds, and just the right amount of spice. \u00a0My bf's roast beef was decidedly less appealing- flavorless, rather grey, and reminiscent of an Arby's castaway (albeit much more expensive). Perhaps we caught them on a bad day/ordered the wrong thing. The place was packed and the market definitely looked enticing, so I'd be willing to give it one more shot (but not five stars...yet).",

We ordered a large cheese plate, a bottle of wine and apparently also 40 minutes of admiring the atmosphere, which was filled with patrons asking when their own cheese plate and bottle of wine would be available. It was like a cruel cruel hazing cycle where we watched with our own eyes as people who had ordered before us endured a lengthy interval before their food came. Yet, we still hoped that our own experience would be different and remained cruelly silent when new people were seated. \"No!\" we should have shouted, \"Leave this place now, while you still can! Before you are trapped by the promise of cheeeeese.\"There was allegedly only one cheese preparer in the kitchen working on all these complex creations. I am no expert cheesemonger, but I imagine the slicing and plating of dairy products does not in itself require many minutes of contemplation. Mysteries!",

More seating room, more food stuff for sale, and a bigger closed off cheese room. However, the size of the cheese room seemed to make it less impressive to me, as a very tiny room filled to the brim with a massive selection of cheeses just seemed to be an amazing thing.Not that it would stop me from coming here or shopping here. However, since the other La Fromagerie is closer to home, it's more likely to be where I stop for cheese.

And this is great because it's allows me to combine both and have the perfect Sunday = market shopping in the morning, wonderful lunch at the market and cooking/dinner with friends in the evening!La Fromagerie is a combination of a cheese shop, an Italian grocery, a wine shop and a delicious foodie restaurant. I'm not a huge fan of the grocery part as prices are really expensive (which is costing them 1 star). But it adds to the decor, and makes the whole place very special!The little/tiny restaurant is tucked in a the back, under a nice roof window that brings a lot of light. There's one big main table in the middle and then 2-seat tables on the sides and a stool-bar type table running along the back wall. And a few tables where the wine is stored in a little other room. And it's not really rooms per say, everything is open. It's more like a wonderful labyrinth, with loads of temptations all over the place :DThe menu is simple, and very yummy. Fresh stuff all the time. This Sunday we had the rabbit ravioli with sage butter and a little Parmesan. So delicious. Unbelievable. With a full body red wine. And then I took the chocolate & mascarpone cream cake. It was a food orgasm :)You also have choices of platters (cheese, meat, fish) to share, which is nice when with friends. Most of the food is on display here and there, so it's hard to resist! Specially the desserts.Just go, enter and enjoy. I bet you stay to eat!And staff is friendly, and chillaxed. What more do you want on a WE?",

    "text": "I love La Fromagerie! I first went here with my friend who needed to buy a selection of cheeses for a dinner party event and was dragged into the 'famous' large cheese refrigerator. The shop sells a selection of high quality ingredients, free produced and baked goods. Warning: the groceries here are very expensive. My friend brought three small cheeses for \u00a340.In the heart of the shop, there is a small cafe but it looks more like a communal kitchen/dinning room.A few months later I decided to try out the tasting cafe inside the shop on my second visit. We arrived very late into the afternoon and was told the kitchen was closed and that we could only order the drinks and their selection of cakes and cheeses, proceeding with the order despite the restricted menu anyways! Having settled down on the communal benches and tables.I opted for the cheesecake (\u00a34) and elderflower cordial (\u00a31.50). The drink was massive, you could fill up two glasses shared between two. Tasty and dear might I say better than the homemade cordial I make myself!Cheesecake was nice, light and cheesy. New York styled baked cheesecake type with sour cream at the top. My friends opted for the lovely carrot cake which was MASSIVE and coffee. \u00a0We shared the cheese board (\u00a38) which was amazing. We got the larger size plate of british cheese and shared between three people. It did not seem like a lot but the cheese was very filling.You could eat one large cheeseboard by yourself if you are a massive cheese lover.My university campus is nearby so whenever \u00a0I need a self indulgence in food, I know I will definitely be here again.",

Unsurprisingly, given its name, cheese is the big deal here and there is a large tasting room, temperature controlled and pungent to put it politely. However, there are also myriad other options including the best clementines I have ever eaten, chocolates and special blends of tea and coffee.There is also a cafe which serves possibly the best brownies in London alongside other tasty treats. It's not cheap but it is good quality, although I was surprised when the creme fraiche that I was offered with my brownie (excellent for cutting through the richness of the chocolate) was charged as extra on the bill. Still, if you can afford it, this is a great shop for all the special things in life, and if you can't, this is still a lovely place to pick up a tiny morsel of cheese or very occasional jar of something as a gourmet treat.",

These are things I need to know!When entering the cheese room one must go through sliding glass doors which lead to a humidity controlled room. The walls are lined with wooden aging racks and the cheeses are huddled in groups (by type) for display. Samples are available but I'm not sure that they are common. The sales person who was helping us seemed a bit taken aback when we asked for a sample of a very expensive cheese. The food is not as good as I hoped. I had the roast beef with beets and horseradish. BF had nettle soup which was stunningly smooth and creamy.A great book to read before or after this shop is \"The Cheese Room\" by Patricia Michelson.

A large shop-front more or less entirely devoted to the art of fromage, you'll be sure to find something you love here, as well as something new to try. The chilled cheese room is a real treat, and it's staffed by helpful people who really know their cheese. Back in the main part of the shop, you'll find everything you need to accompany your cheese from fresh veg to chutneys, interesting crackers and artisan bread. There's also a dining area where cheese tasting courses are regularly held. This is one of two branches of La Fromagerie, as there is a much more compact outpost in Highbury. For those not in the immediate vicinity, the website is well worth a look too: not only does it have some very evocative cow-bells to accompany your online shopping - it has a 'virtual cheeseroom', too.

I found it by accident - when researching \"Real Bread\". There is a movement in London towards properly made, artisinal bread. Long, slow fermentation, natural ingredients, good shaping... La Fromagerie popped up as such a place. I went and was blown away. Walking in to the main store, you are overwhelmed by fresh smells of mint, basil, and the general goodness of fresh produce. They keep the cheese in its own room (cool and smelly). Some of the cheeses need ankle bracelets to stop them from escaping. Especially the Muenster. One of the best ever.And then you can sit and have a glass of wine and a cheese/charcuterie plate in another part of the rather sprawling space. Absolutely outstanding.",

    "text": "What a lovely place! La Fromagerie consists of a delicatessen (with a separate cheese section) and integrated shared dining area. Judging by how busy the place was on a Monday lunchtime, I'd be a bit scared to come here at the weekend. They offer a tasting menu with accompanying wine, as well as an a la carte option of yummy delicacies. We opted for an absolutely delicious tart and frittata and home made strawberry & rhubarb cordial (they probably could have been a bit more generous with the sirup quantity ). We just about managed to avoid the temptation of a cheese board, but just couldn't resist trying one of the sweet options. The Sicilian apple cake was divine and much lighter than feared.I will definitely come back when next in the area; or when planning my next dinner party, as all the produce in the shop looks delicious and quite unusual.",

The real show stopper here is the cheese room - holy cow! Packed full of all types of cheese. The selection is mind blowing. It's no wonder they were voted the best cheese shop in London. I'd love to be a mouse locked up in that room nibbling away at everything.In the back, there is a small space with tables where you can taste a small menu of freshly prepared food of the day for breakfast, lunch or an afternoon snack. They also have wine & cheese tasting plates - I will be back for a wine & cheese tasting. Oh and best part for me is they are located right next to my favorite butcher - The Ginger Pig making it the perfect Sunday shopping trip to La Fromagerie where I can be swaddled in foodie bliss and then to the Marylebone farmers market across the street, ending with a trip to the butcher for my short rib or pork shoulder order which I can't seem to find anywhere else.

The special for that day was eggplant, dried tomato (so good!), capretta toscana, and greens on a delicious focaccia. Picked up some apples to round out a satiating meal. It's an in and out kind of place, and I'd highly recommend it. My suggestion: buy a sandwich and drink and eat it in Regent's Park, if you're able wait during the walk!",

Of course, it is modern but it is fashioned after the stores of yore which makes the experience all the more pleasant. If you don't have time to shop, just open the door, take a whiff and continue on your way. Your olfactory senses will be dancing in your brain all the way to the end of the street.",

You can browse their shop as you wait to be seated and whet your appetite with the sight of their delectable offerings. I went for the pancakes with figs, walnuts and mascarpone cheese and they were absolutely heavenly. My dining partner had a beef carpaccio which was just perfection according to him. The service was very attentive and the ambience of the place is really charming. The only reason I didn't give a 4-star review is that my food came a good 5 minutes after my partner's which I wasn't too delighted by.",

Went there today and seriously, what is with wait staff who don't bother doing their jobs? Got to the sign that says please wait to be seated. My pregnant wife and I stood there as waiters walked past before I eventually got bored of it and asked to sit down in the half empty restaurant. After seating the waiters (maybe 6 or 7 in total) would rush to serve people (again in the half empty place) and not bother to look or pay attention when we'd try to get their attention to order. Went to providores instead which is always better... Think I'll stop entertaining even trying to give fromagerie a chance.",

We walked in and there is a grocery store/market and then in the back is the restaurant portion. We were seated right away at a small table for 2 and given menus. Our server came over and took our drink order while we looked over the menu.I decided to go with the Farmhouse Breakfast which included 3 different cheeses, cantaloupe, yogurt, prosciutto, and bread. It was all really good and fresh. I also got English breakfast tea, since I was in London. Breakfast was fulfilling, but not heavy. After we ate, we walked around the store and went into there cheese refrigerator which is a climate controlled room filled with tons of cheeses. It was really neat and the guy working in there was very friendly and let us try a few cheeses before purchasing. This is a great local store and restaurant that I hope to visit when I'm back in London.",

The look and feel of La Fromagerie screams effortless cool but is surprisingly staffed by friendly, knowledgable staff who appear to love the foodstuffs as much as the patrons. First things first, breakfast at the restaurant is amazing. The concentration, unsurprisingly, is on letting the true flavors of the food sing through simple recipes. Service was excellent and the latte delicious. Now, the produce: The smoked salmon is made in-house and is so tasty; the bread is to die for; and you can pick up some amazing cheeses that shockingly won't break the bank. All in all, this is a foodies paradise but can definitely be appreciated by anyone visiting the neighborhood.",
