Well, friends, I have a place for you to go...I have to admit, I've seen the outside of the Little Bay restaurant in Farringdon and was a bit wary about going to this one. It turns out my worries were all in vain as this restaurant is super cheap, super adorable and super friendly.When we arrived, we were greeted enthusiastically \u00a0by the manager (owner?), who urged us to pick any seat we wanted. Of course, we picked the loft style table, which is an awesome little nook that you climb bunk bed ladders to get to. It's dark enough to make it romantic, so future dates are advised!The food was cheap and good! Free bread basket to abate the hunger and then the food was out in record time...seriously, I've never had such fast service in London. The lamb steak was excellent in a sweet curry sauce with vegetables. My friend and I split a bottle of wine and a desert (and yes...the profiteroles are to die for!) and our bill totaled \u00a330. Wine, main course, desert and excellent service for \u00a315 each. Such an excellent deal, you'll be able to hit the pub after.",

The Little Bay has been entertaining the taste buds of both locals and visitors with its mixture of modern European and Mediterranean cuisine for over 15 years. Made up of little booths, likened to the inside of a ship, the Little Bay is cosy and intimate. The perfect place to catch up with old friends or have a romantic one to one liason. The great thing about the Little Bay is that it won't bust the bank. The prices have stayed the same for all the years that I've been a fan. The Little Bay doesn't accept card / payments on plastic so they can keep their prices down and you can enjoy a great meal without attacking your overdraft. Enjoy!",

Little Bay is an exceptional European and Mediterranean eatery! The food is wonderfully reasonable in price and you may even feel as though it is a steal, because the food is rich, flavorful and filling despite what seems to be a smaller portion. Make sure to check the deals on the black board outside before you enter. They have deals such as 2 courses for 7.50 or 3 courses for 10 before 7pm (don't quote me on that exact cost, due to the fact I haven't been to the location since before the Christmas season and I could be slightly off). They have managed to make the best use of space on the main floor by having many little tables but also built platforms that allow for a nook underneath with a very small intimate table for 2 and also a single table up on the platform itself. But, no worries! If you have a large group, the lower level is big enough to book a table for 10 for a special occasion. No matter which level you are on, the atmosphere is comfy, cozy, and quite romantic with each table having its only bit of candle light.",

The food tastes great and yet is priced quite low. This makes it very attractive. The menu changes with the seasons, however the last time I went I really enjoyed the salmon. I also tried some hand cut chips that were amazing. I also have a cheesecake for desert that was absolutely delicious.

I came here a fair bit 10 or so years ago and had forgotten how good it is for the money. I love the ramshackle seating here and service is always friendly, if somewhat brisk. The dishes are all a little different from the norm, so it can be a nice experience to try a few dishes between a few people. I know that every review mentions that price, but the last time I paid The Little Bay a visit, I was actually surprised at the relatively high price of three people dining and a bottle of wine to split. It used to be very, very cheap. Regardless of price, the food is great here. The atmosphere has it's charm. The service is a decent standard. What is not to like?",

It's 2.95 for starters before 7pm and 3.95 after. The waitress even told us to order our desserts before 7pm so it was cheaper. I really enjoyed the food, especially the crab and avocado starter. I didn't order that but I kinda wanted it for myself. My dessert could have been better but for 3 bucks, I really can't complain.

And seating also under the side tables that barely fit two people. Such a strange design considering that there's a whole other room next door AND downstairs for people to dine in. Maybe they've been slowly adding onto the premises over the years or something. Anywho.Definitely makes it quirky and worth a look see.Pretty simple, comforting foods. All delicious and some were surprisingly beautifully plated. I think mostly the fancy starters and salads. Made me smile. And cheap. Cheap is good. Especially when you get added entertainment of just lookin around the place for free.",

I cannot comment though on the prices because when we went they had a fantastic promotional deal where in the end you actualy paid whatever you wanted!!!! Amazing idea!

The Chablis that we had was acidic - not as nice as I expected based on the price and overall description.Mussels were lovely with a very creamy and garlic-full sauce. Marinated vegetables appetizer was salty according to my friend, however I thought it was delicious based on the few bites that I had. For what it's worth, Duke is right - add some fries and the mussels make a meal. I had the duck salad, and it was nice, but too much food.We also tried chicken staffed with lamb. Gravy was generic, but the chicken was well cooked, and there was a lot of cheese which worked with all the flavors. The dish perhaps should've been called chicken with cheese :-)Overall very nice place, good prices, don't have the Chablis, but I'd come back and try more appetizers.",

The restaurant has a small and unassuming shop front which it would be easy to walk past without giving a second thought, but cross the threshold and the atmosphere is cosy and welcoming. The service is friendly and attentive. The size and layout means the Little Bay is better suited to small groups or romantic dinners rather than large groups.If I find myself in the area again I'll definitely pop in for a meal.",

    "text": "Let's start out by saying; I get this bohemian thing that they wanted to achieve. Inside it looks like an old gypsy's wagon tent. (After they lived in it for 30 years). Tables are jammed in the front dining room; I didn't see the back room so I can't comment. They stack loft sitting in a couple of the corners and jam small tables of one and two underneath. As I ate is saw several parties refuse to climb the steep stairs due to being older and or larger than their other clientele. If they supplied crampons for my shoes I would have like to experience the food at a higher elevation. (Maybe the food would have tasted better). Everything is shop worn from the odds and end tables (mine was a bit short so I felt much taller than I am), to chairs and the woodwork. Shop worn paint on the stairs and railings. Not sure what the silver lame was doing on the ceiling but I looked to make sure it wasn't the mother ship hovering over me while I ate my last meal on earth. As for the service, what's to complain about? They were attentive but lacked the connection that you normally get in a small establishment or whilst dining with a caravan of travelers. They provided bread for the table that was essentially tasteless. The butter served, I wasn't 100% convinced it was real butter) was tasteless as well.I ordered pig cheeks with dark greens for a starter. It came out almost immediately. Yikes, a sure sign of pre-cooking and re heating a delicate meat. Sure enough when I asked, they said it was sliced and then heated. What I got was dry stringy pork; it reminded me of reheated turkey. Dry flavorless and stringy. It also had bacon underneath not sure why but it was on the plate. \u00a0There was a sauce that I couldn't put my finger on what it was made from but it lubricated my throat so I didn't choke the cheek meat down.My main course was duck sliced and baked with a ginger sauce, it too had a vegetables and a stuffed pastry filled with moist flavorful duck, I liked that small medallion of pastry the other slices were dry and flavorless. The ginger sauce lacked any tang or flavor. \u00a0It looked like they only had one dessert to choose from. I passed.Will I go there again, yes, believe it or not I felt that they may have gotten lost in the weeds. I suggest sitting down and taste your food once in a while and don't treat this delicate little place like a catering hall with precooked meat waiting for a fiery reheat and serve. As for the price, extreamly reasonable, I spent 10 quid on the meal. I would have paid 15 to 17 if it tasted betterRomantic you want? Put a red scarf over the lamp in your room fire up any album from John Legend. Cook up some tiger prawns and paella, add a nice cab or a pinot blanc or noir, and finish the meal with some chocolate strawberrys.Keep your eye on the scarf so it doesn't catch on fire.",

I would come back again if I'm ever in the area.One thing to note is that they have 4 elevated tables that you have to climb up steep stairs into.

    "text": "Little Bay is one of those neighbourhood restaurants that you wish was in your neighbourhood. It's quirky and cosy; the food is good, the service is friendly; and the bill will make your jaw drop - but in a good way.I was taken there recently by a friend who lives nearby. The exterior doesn't prepare you for what you find inside - not that much could. What you find is an intimate space, decorated in dark reds with baroque panels, rather like the sort of small 18th century opera house you might find in Prague or Salzburg. There are even little balcony \"boxes\" with tables accessed by vertiginous stairs (NB not good for long legged or tall people).The food is a mixture of French and modern European. There are vegetarian starters and mains, but the menu is heavy on throroughly meaty dishes, such as char-grill Lamb Steak, with crushed new potatoes, julienne vegetables and green peppercorn sauce, or chicken breast stuffed with minted minced lamb, herbal mash and Port wine sauce. I had the grilled Portobello mushroom, prepared with garlic and served with spinach and a roast pepper sauce; followed by roast aubergine strudel, stuffed with grilled asparagus and ricotta cheese, served with French beans and a tomato and basil sauce. Service was very pleasant throughout and I like the fact that they don't charge for a basket of bread.The prices vary depending on whether you book before or after 7pm; you'll save a pound on the starter and a couple of pounds on the main course if you go before. We had a very decent French vin de pays as the house wine. Pleasanter still was the bill - \u00a355 (including service) for three people each having two courses, after 7pm.I'll definitely go back - or maybe try one of their other branches...",

The restaurant is largish and busy, so it is surprising quite how relaxed and friendly the atmosphere is.The menu is extensive, \u00a0serving what they describe as modern French. The food is simply delicious. The flavours are intense and the food perfectly cooked. We had a dish of duck cooked two ways (braised and en croute) and lamb cooked two ways (cutlets and minced). Difficult to convey how beautifully the flavours exploded in the mouth. Served rustically, in very large portions, with well cooked vegetables. We did not order potatoes, \u00a0but the chef thought it needed them. So they sent out a complimentary portion of cabbage and roast potatoes, \u00a0cooked in perfect rustic French style.The selection of desserts was smaller, about half a dozen. But it is almost impossible to avoid, having seen the substantial and appetising desserts passing by to other customers. We had what ranks amongst the best profiteroles we have had .The food is quite delicious, \u00a0the atmosphere quirky and warm and welcoming yet gentle enough for easy conversation, and really good value. The meal for four, two courses with wine, cost \u00a388. Well worth a visit.",

Portions and prices make me wish my stomach had a secret trap. Definitely a place I'd take anyone from dates to parents. Love it",

The staff was friendly, me and my mother was greeted as we stepped through the door possibly the manager/owner as i saw him last time i was there and he mainly orders the others about.. we was given the option where to sit and we sat in the same place like last time which was the little cave like space in the corner of the room. I went in first as i know my mother suffers from claustrophobia so she sat at the end (where you can get out!!). The staff was also very attentive..we sat down for about 5/10 mins before the waiter came to ask us what we wanted to drink, got them quite quickly too. After another 5/10mins we were asked what we wanted to eat and got the food quite quickly too.. the roast was lovely a bit different portion size (it seemed a bit smaller) from last time but still nice and flavoursome! great deal considering it was only \u00a36.85 as we were there before 7pm.. the place itself looks very theatrical in appearance as i know looking on their website, thats what they are all about as they have other branches around london too... roman artwork all around the seating areas and each seating structure is made out of wood like the old theatre shows.. it makes you feel like your at a theatre which is what they wanted you to experience.. will go back as the menu is endless with loads of choices and great value for money!",

Last time we went our bill was \u00a375 for 4 people including mains for all, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, plus a nice bottle of French wine. We go to this restaurant A LOT mainly because it's walking distance from our house but also because it's about the same price as buying a ready meal... but we don't have to do dishes at the end!I like taking international guests to this place to show them the 'real' London. It's such amazing food with really unique and creative choices. The atmosphere is second to none in the area and whilst most tempers will tell you to sit in the balconies, I like the table right in the middle of the restaurant where you can see all of the balconies and their intricate detail. There is also a separate dining room out the back which is worth checking out.Also it's worth mentioning the crab profiteroles... what an amazing idea and delicious to boot!We will come back here many more times!!!",

It has a super cute and cozy atmosphere that we thoroughly enjoyed.We had the muscles and crab pastries to start, followed by the leg of lamb and duck, topped off with a tiramisu. Everything was superb - especially the tiramisu. I highly recommend!",

A proper 3 course meal is 11 pounds!...What?!It's not fancy at all- rustic is a good way to describe it but still a nice place to have a meal with friends and family.The goat cheese parcel and Char-grill Lamb Steak are my go to dishes. I've enjoyed it every time. A bottle of wine very inexpensive and the table bread is even good. Excellent value for money.The only con is the toilets are ridiculously small. I don't know how an obese person would use it and they were not the cleanest which was a let down. The state of the toilets are really telling in any establishment.",

    "text": "This is the original Little Bay. I've alsbeen to other branches at Farringdon and the one in Brighton, which are both good. Have to admit though, this one is my favourite. The food,service and price are equally good at the others, but I feel this one has a more cosy and intimate feel to it.I visited this Sunday for lunch. \u00a0Managed to get a table without booking, but the place was packed within 20 minutes of our arrival.On this occassion I had Crispy Goat Cheese Parcel with Waldorf Salad and Walnuts for my starter. It was really tastey and not too heavy.For the main course I had BelsizeChickenBreast stuffed with Parma Ham and Mozzarella, Herbal Mash and Port Wine Sauce. This was really good and very filling.Lunch was washed down with a very nice shared bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.For value for money, you really cannot go wrong with Little Bay for value. As we were dining before 7pm, the starter was \u00a32.55 and my main was \u00a35.95. Even the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc came in at \u00a315.95.Highly recommend this place. You won't leave disappointed.",

The food was really nice but wasn't too keen on the decor as it was extremely dark and considering the crowd, not suitable at all for it. They sat us downstairs which again wasn't suitable for a third of the group which they were already aware of. Aside from this. We all enjoyed the food and ourselves. I read previous reviews and was looking forward to coming here but I think with the big group, they just couldn't cater very well to it. Like I mentioned before the food was nice and the service was as well as can be for the big group. I think I will come back and see how it is then.",
