I strongly recommend this restaurant!I had the \"slow braised beef in aromatic coconut reduction with fresh lime, lemongrass and chilli \" with sticky rice: a delicious treat! My friend went for the\"yellow coconut curry with New Zealand lamb, new potatoes and baby onions\" and was very delighted about her dish as well. The range of wines from all over the world is impressive (starting with about \u00a3 17 per bottle - as far as I remember). We went for a fruity ros\u00e9 wine from Thailand which was a very good choice!The ambience of the restaurant is stylish and traditional but not to cold. The service is proficient but warmhearted.The bill for two main courses, a side dish, one bottle of wine, one bottle of water and two thai teas totaled \u00a3 83 (service included).",

My boyfriend and I were put into a quiet corner which was nice and we were served promptly even though it was still quite busy at 9.30pm.The food was really very good and I was pleased that they did coconut rice \u00a0my favourite. I had the green curry which was tasty \u00a0although I'm not convinced it was worth the price tag. However, my boyfriend had the deep fried sea bass in light red curry sauce which was excellent \u00a0and exciting as it is a dish we haven't come across in London before.The actual restaurant is visually interesting and the ambience was bustling and generally enticing. Overall I would say this is a great experience, but perhaps a little overpriced.",

However, the Nua Tom Kati was by far the most filling dish on the table with several large chunks of beef. It was so filling in fact, that even after sharing a couple pieces, I still wanted to share more! Flavors here were very different than other Thai restaurants I've been to. Meats were really fresh tasting and unprocessed (you know how sometimes you'll eat meat at an Asian restaurant and it doesn't take like how it normally does when you cook it yourself). Vegetables and garnishes were really fresh as well.",

    "text": "I've really struggled to find absolutely-blow-your-mind awesome Thai food in London. \u00a0There are quite a few cheap-and-good places, and I'm quite partial to Addie's in Earl's Court, but finding that special place has been a hard task.On top of this, I'm usually ver sceptical about Asian fine dining (excluding Japanese) - my last experience had been Plum Valley in Chinatown which, while pretty decent, really didn't do more for me than a normal Chinese restaurant. \u00a0Sure, it's nice to have something different, plus you know that the ingredients are probably not Grade Q (for questionable, or something), but it's not usually worth the mark up that comes with it. \u00a0That said, Thai food - in my mind - lends itself to fine dining more readily than Chinese; generally speaking, I find the dishes have more colour and aromatic complexity, and after reading some of the lovely reviews from you guys, I decided this was worth the shot. \u00a0Hey, if things go badly, it's on ALL YOUR HEADS. \u00a0GUARANTEED.They've really gone all out on the interior and for the most part err on the side of not tacky (the replica Buddhist temple in the centre does push that boundary though). \u00a0Either way, it's a decent space and doesn't come with the same packed-like-a-nuclear-bunker feeling that some of the restaurants in the same area do.For starter, we had the green mango salad with soft shell crab, betel-wrapped prawns and beef, and tuna tartare. \u00a0The first thing I noticed were the generous portions - hey, you get quite a lot for your money, which I don't always expect in places like this. \u00a0There were two large bits of soft shell crab which were excellent - the batter wasn't too thick, and the crab itself wasn't mushy as it often is. \u00a0There could've been a little more salad, but hey. \u00a0The betel-wrapped goodies were pleasant too - the beef was amazingly juicy, and the leaves didn't totally dominate the flavour. \u00a0The leaves don't go as well with the prawns, but it was still good. \u00a0The fusion-y tuna tartare was ok - fresh fish, and nice lemongrass garnish - but the flavour combination is a bit weak compared to other preparations (especially Japanese/French ones).The mains were similarly of impressive size: we went for the braised beef in coconut, lime, lemongrass, and chilli; the Panang Lamb Shank curry; the sugar snap peas with prawns and mushrooms; and lastly, some pineapple rice. \u00a0The braised beef was all manner of cheesy words, but I'mma go for sumptuous. \u00a0Ok, so it wasn't *quite* falling apart, but the flavours in the dish are excellent - I especially liked the little bits of lime left in the sauce which give each mouthful a little tangy lift as a great contrast to the creamy, saturated fat (aka coconut milk) sauce. \u00a0The Panang curry needs no introduction on this thread either, and totally lived up to its billing - I was just sad that I couldn't pick up the bone, and gnaw every last bit off it (and suck out the marrow). \u00a0The veg was good too - just the right amount of crunch. \u00a0The pineapple rice was ok...at its heart, it reminded me of kedgeree, but it lacked a little something to make it extra special.So, why 4 stars? \u00a0As good as this place is (and, although pricier than most Thai food, gives you a lot for your money, unlike most fine dining places these days...), I just thought that the spice levels were REALLY tame. \u00a0I understand that the chefs don't want to drown the complexity of the dishes with chilli, and that they have to cater to their audience, but for me they've just reduced the spice too much. \u00a0Even the chilli garnishes have a meagre Scoville rating...I'm guessing that you can probably request more chilli, but to completely ignore part of what makes Thai food Thai food is kind of heinous in my eyes.With that said, I still look forward to coming back here - there's no denying that the dishes are REALLY flavourful, and totally worth the extra over your average Thai. \u00a0Just sneak some sliced Bird's Eyes in with you.",

This appetizer was well-done but not really my taste. I would skip this one next time. For main course we had white rice with Chicken and bamboo shoots green curry which was very good (a little salty but I have very low salt tolerance). We also had a slow braised beef dish with hints of lime, chili and pineapple that was amazing. That was subtle, creative and delicious. It is a bit pricey. A meal for 2 with drinks came to 80GBP.",

They were pretty accommodating and this wasnt a problem. although the second dish was absolutely delicious, it was quite small and there was more prawn than actual curry.

    "text": "Apparently we're all wrong - Patara is the best Thai restaurant in The World. So it's time we forgot about our personal favourite local gems or that street stall when we were in Chiang Mai... the powers have decreed and Patara wins.Patara Bangkok has won best Thai restaurant in Thailand for the last two years and the good news for London is that the Pataras here have virtually the identical menu, ambiance, service levels and cocktails of their little sister in SE Asia. I say little sister because London's Pataras came first... Mayfair, Chelsea and then here in Soho.. before they then headed to the homeland to win their world prize. Think of Patara as our homegrown champion.This Soho Patara is my favourite in London, and runs close to the dining mansion that they have in Bangkok. The interior in the depths below Greek Street is gorgeous, with a beautiful intricate model of the Thai Royal Palace as the worthy centrepiece. I only wish they had their own Tuk-Tuk like they do in Thong Lor.The cocktails are crafted by their award-winning barman on Maddox St and a worth a visit but let's be honest you're here for the food, and it won't disappoint. Rammed full of flavour, presented with artistic beauty and the finest quality through and through - it's easily worth the double or even triple cost compared to your local Thai, heck... it's even worth the 15-times cost compared to the Bangkok streetfood.::: and why is it so good? :::1. Real Thai, not fusion - Authentic dishes, true recipes, no compromise on cooking style, fish sauces or hot spice levels (warning!)2. The best ingredients money can buy - Not beef curry, but veal osso bucco curry. Not seafood and lime spicy salad but smoked salmon and pomelo spicy salad.3. Perfection - classic dishes endlessly studied by the chefs, worked on and improved until nirvana.It's an amazing methodical approach to get the best Thai food on Earth, and strangely behind it all is a mega corporate company called S&P, who seem to be the Thai equivalent of the Marks and Spencer food section. I guess they decided they could afford a wonderful little pet project....",

Patara soothed me with it's... mood lighting, then brought me the kind of food that assured me that (minus carved vegetable flowers and the aforementioned mood lighting) all my wishes would be granted.I started with the Srangwah Hoy Shell (poached scallops) and not only we're they actually spicy, they were the best scallops I have ever had in my life. So well cooked and well seasoned. I also got to try some of the Miang Guaytiew (fresh rice paper rolls) and they were really good too! Really good! Even the completely ridiculous sounding \"Do-It-Yourself Thai tacos\" were tasty and well spiced. What is going on Patara? You were meant to offer me a few curries and some bland spring rolls in oddly shaped dishes, not perfectly executed SPICY FLAVOURFUL food!My main course was a slight let down, I had Gai Yang Kamin (grilled chicken and chilli dip) which came on skewers and was incredibly tender, but so unbelievably sweet I was unable to finish it. I asked for it with Som Tum, which wasn't spicy enough and only okay. The sticky rice was good. I also got to try (a lot) of the Nua Tom Kat (slow braised beef) which was a total five star dish. Zesty, meaty and flavourful and a huge portion!We finished with a mango sticky rice which we all shared, it was presented nicely and was very good. I left surprised, happy and very, very full.",

I had the Gai Pad Khing (chicken with mushrooms, onion and pineapple). The ingredients tasted so fresh and perfectly cooked. My cousin had the scallops which came with the 2 or 3 spicy star warning on the menu, so I did not try them. I had a glass of white wine. I was a little underwhelmed by it, but probably just a poor choice. There were a decent amount of wines by the glass.

I was pleased by Patara. We showed up tonight (Sunday) without reservations, to find a restaurant whose main dining room was basically full. But, there was space for us, and we were seated immediately. The decor is pretty nice, not too overdone, except for the giant replica Buddhist monastery in the center of the room.We ordered two appetizers, a curry, and an entree, as well as two bowls of rice, for the two of us. It was plenty of food. All of that, plus a couple of beers, and the check came to about 75 pounds, which is not too bad, considering the food was pretty good. I'll probably never go back, but that's just because I'm in London infrequently, and there's so much else to try here. But, you should give it a whirl.",

    "text": "After much sauntering around Soho peering through a series of less than inspiring restaurant windows, I stumbled upon Patara. The first thing you'll notice about the place is that they've positioned a large bush directly in front of the menu outside, making it rather difficult to get a look at what they have to offer.Never mind, this only served to make me look inside and it is beautifully styled. Dimly lit with dark woods galore and a centrepiece in the main room that looks like a scaled-down Buddhist temple made of solid gold. Nice!Staff were immediately attentive, taking our jackets and showing us to a table. It was quite busy for a Monday night, and despite not having a reservation there were no complaints or waits and a table was promptly found for us.On a purely aesthetic level Patara has a lot going for it. There is an air of quality to everything from the menus to the cutlery and the tables and chairs are solid and reassuring.Having poured over the menu for an eternity, we decided not to bother with starters and opted for just a main course each, rice and a side.I had the ubiquitous Pad Thai Jay accompanied by the Pad Hed Hom and was ever so slightly disappointed. Although tasty, the dish seemed a little lacking. Not enough nuts in with the noodles and a little too greasy for my taste. The broccoli side dish was exactly as expected, well cooked green veg with oyster mushrooms and a garlic sauce. The two went very well together, but as I said, didn't light up the world.Where things started to get interesting was when the Gang Kiew Wan Pak was served. They do a good looking curry in Patara, and I wanted to switch dishes immediately! Served in a gold bowl, heated by a candle underneath we were hit with a wave of the most beautiful smell I've encountered so far in 2010. The portion was big, and accompanied by our choice of wholemeal jasmine rice.From this initial experience they've done enough to convince me that the rest of the menu will be of a high standard.Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Ah Patara, I've avoided giving you a review for a while (this review will show my mixed feelings).Patara (Greek street) is part of a small chain of Thai restaurants. It is possibly both my girlfriend's and her sister's favourite restaurant, so I was there recently with both.First off, the food. It is very good, I had a beef starter special which was cooked just right then a green curry with rice that was spicy whilst allowing other non-chilli flavours through. Other diners had various other dishes and everyone was satisfied. We ordered various desserts, I had the sticky rice with ice-cream which was ok-ish.Now on to drinks. I had a rather disappointing lychee martini, though other members of the group were more than happy with their cocktails.Decor - very nice, neither too bring or very dark, the place is tasteful, clean and classy (including bathrooms). There can be a very good atmosphere when the place is quite full.Service is very good, staff are attentive and drinks are brought quickly.So, why only three stars? In a word, price. Patara might be the best Thai restaurant I've been to in London, but not by much. There are other places where the decor is not as good or there isn't a big cocktail menu or special dishes, but where you can get traditional Thai dishes for less than half the price of those at Patara (Their green curry is \u00a314.50 excl rice) which taste just as good. I can understand why they might charge a lot for more for their less standard dishes, but if you just want a nice relatively traditional Thai meal and don't need to be sitting with the trendies it is hard to justify the \u00a345 (incl 1 cocktail and service) I \u00a0spent for three courses, when going a little more downmarket could cut your bill in half.",

    "text": "The review is for this particular restaurant which is on Greek street. The one which is off Regent and the second one which is on the Knightsbridge are much better quality food. (Top of the chain- the one in Vienna).  Timing is good. Food varies. The spring rolls were little oily, but not dry, so- ok. The rest was also \"ok\" quality: they put too much sweet coconut milk in the shrimp Thai Curry and had very little lime leaf. Also added alcohol in it didn't make the shrimps taste on top of it structure, but rather covered it delicacy with over sweet and not well balanced sauce. It was eatable, but needs improvement in cooking skill. The rice noodles tasted of meat grease covered with dark soy sauce and thick piles of lemongrass, you cannot chew because they weren't cut in a proper size. So that dish was \"ok\" quality too. But \"ok\" isn't the level for such place as Patara. Known worldwide for its best healthy quality food and impeccable presentation. We ordered fried banana for dessert, which came like has been warmed up a little, not fried, soggy and tasteless. The ice cream was good, but isn't made in the house. So- in this particular place is a disappointment. Add to it the Bellini cocktail- simple to make and always so delicious at Patara's in Vienna, the one they brought wasn't tasty, because they didn't use it right proportions of peach syrup in it.",

(no offence to dear Thai friends). However, Patara set the new standard of how a fine Thai cuisine should be for me.-Impressive ambience.-Attentive services.-GREAT FOOD.I ordered a king scallop in chilli sauce for starter. Very unique, especially the very Thai style spicy. Very very fresh ingredients!! Main course was Char-grilled Marinated Chicken. I think this is a more modern touch of Thai cuisine but it definitely delivers the traditional flavour your are looking for. The salad makes a very good complement.Consider the fact that it is a fine dining restaurant, price is acceptable. For me, I will come back.",

    "text": "Potential Perfection at PataraWent to Patara with a new friend in London on Friday, March 11th and had an amazing dinner.- Lamb leg curry- Pad Thai- Prawns with snap peas- RiceThe service at Patara is ALMOST impeccable. Extremely friendly staff. When I ordered beer at the bar, they said they would bring it to me in the waiting room and they did promptly.The decor is beautiful and ornate without being gauche. It reminded me of the nicer OSHA restaurants in SF. I can only give this 4 stars though, because it took 3 times for me to ask for rice before we received it. Quite unfortunate as I really would have loved the rice at the beginning of the meal to soak up all the wonderful curry sauce.The food is exquisite. The ingredients are fresh and the sauces/curries do not overpower the freshness of all the elements. The prawns in both dishes were HUGE! And interestingly enough, though I feared smelling like a curry house once I left (which happens at many restaurants that use too much grease and have poor ventillation), none of my clothes smelled bad. I know this for a fact, because I didn't get any dirty looks or sneers from people when I was on the tube. lolI will definitely return to Patara--Well Done!",

My dining companion was in ecstasy as he ate this. I'm not sure which I liked more: watching him eat it or eating it myself. Either way, order it.- Presentation was nice on everything, as always. I dig their little flourishes (carrot flowers, anyone?)- Corn fritters remain a fun starter, with their lovely accompanying cucumber salad.- Don't miss the spiked ice tea on the drinks menu.

Its easy to find, so many great restaurant on Greek st. just next to my favorite korean 'Bi Bim Bap'. Nice table with just 2 ppl, the plates are just ok to fit on such small table. The chips are free, and they are nice. Drinks - guanabana juice and mango juice. its great! love it!Soup - Dong Yim Kong Soup, its ok, i rated it for 5/10Main course - FIsh(\u00a319.99), prawn curry, chicken+veg. Sorry couldnt rmb the name. Brown rice and pineapple seafood rice. i have to admit that the pineapple seafood rice is 10/10!!! O M G delicious! last but not lease, the dessert, we tried the mango with sticky rice. Again, 10/10! I love to recommend this with frds!Its about 50pound pp. The service is ok, staffs are very nice!",

    "text": "I have a pet peeve about airport bathrooms. See my distaste for certain elements of MCO's feng shui [bit.ly/eSt1i6]. I've been in a few seedy bathrooms in my life (say... a visit to the trough at WeHo's Fiesta Cantina [bit.ly/ePExbV])... Even so, I was wholly unprepared for the facilities that Patara offers to its gentlemen clientele. Not only is their urinal a trough... I realized with stunned amazement that even if I -tried- to avert my gaze from peeking/observing/sketchily cruising someone else's junk by staring straight ahead (which would normally be my tactic), I -still- wouldn't be able to avoid doing a little ogling.\"Why?\" you might ask. Well... it may have something to do with the gigantic head-to-waist sized wall mirror that's either intentionally or abysmally placed immediately above said trough. I like peen as much as the next gay, but that's just unnecessary. No, seriously.Anyway, choice of toilet design aside, Patara is exceptional. The servers float, the beer is cold, the dishes are all beyond reproach, and the decor is captivating. Between the dramatic lighting of wall adornment and the imposing candlelit temple in the center of the dining room, there's plenty to feast your eyes on. Your gut won't go empty, either. Each dish was more delightful than the last. I doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu.This isn't your standard cheap eats Thai fare. Just know that you get what you pay for at Patara. And perhaps an eyeful more than you bargained.",

The best dishes we had were the Sragwah Hoy Shell King Scallops, Yum Mamuang Pooh Nim (a bit underdone but flavourful and in a spicy broth) and the Yum Mamuant Pooh Nim Green mango salad with crispy Thai soft-shell crab (crab was very good, salad not too sweet-sour but with lots of peanuts and cashews)The Senjan Pad Thai was good pad thai with big king prawns, the Tuna Tartare was ok but slightly forgettable, and the Nua Tom Kati slow braised beef came in a really good sauce but the meat itself was oddly dry, it felt like it maybe wasn't fatty enough to braise in this style? The sticky rice was good but eat fast, it was nearly hard and unwieldy by the time we were wrapping up the meal and I tried to sop up some of the left over sauce.For desert we had the Banana vanilla ice cream which I really quite liked!I wasn't amazing, it wasn't bad, I wouldn't throw a tantrum if someone invited me there but I don't have any desire to go back either. It was also expensive enough, although that might just be the par for the course.",

This place came up with highly rated by fellow Yelpers and Elites, so I went ahead and booked this place online.Their online booking process is easy, no need to call.Their waiting area was unlike any other waiting areas I have experienced, they have booths set up so it doesn't feel like a waiting area, they serve drinks and prawn crackers while you wait for a table or wait for the rest of your friends to show up.Speaking of prawn crackers... some of the best prawn crackers I have ever had.Friends really enjoyed the food, the decor is lovely and their toilets match the rest of restaurant's decor. (I really love when restaurants do that.) It is a bit pricey, but they make up for it in their food and decor.Personally, I ordered the pad thai with prawns, plating was very well done, but my prawns were tasteless, so that was a bit disappointing.Though knowing my friends enjoyed it, really all that matters.I'd definitely come back here to try some other dishes, if not just for the prawn crackers.",

The only thing better about it was the ambiance - the place was really nicely decorated.The service was fine - but they tried to upsell us 4 times which was incredibly annoying. On our own accord, the bill was 80 pounds - we really didn't need to be up-sold on anything. We each ordered a cocktail - a manhattan for my husband and I ordered one of their champagne cocktail with vodka and lemongrass. The manhattan was very sweet and a little watered down - definitely NOT a manhattan. The champagne cocktail was very small and definitely light on the liquor. I wouldn't recommend those.Then we ordered Tom Yum which was delicious and spring rolls.For our main course we had Pad Thai and the spicy coconut beef roast dish which were quite good. The beef dish was more unique and delicious. There was nothing wrong with the Pad Thai but I really had no idea why I was paying such a high price for it - I have had as good or better Pad Thai elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.We were so excited that they had mango sticky rice, but unfortunately the mango was incredibly sour - it was disgusting. They didn't check back in on us for a long time so we ended up eating the sticky rice and avoiding the mango. Thankfully, they did take it off of our bill at the end. Not a great way to end the meal, though.It was my husband's birthday and I wrote that on the reservation, and they didn't even say happy birthday to him. Thus, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for a special occasion if you're expecting nicer treatment.Overall, it's a fine place to eat. However, I think there are better places to go for a nice meal.",

High on presentation but for me the balance of flavours was overwhelmingly set to 'sweet' on most of the dishes and not balanced. Tom Yum soup was fairly good but really lacking any decent spice level which I look for in this soup. My main of red curry with duck was flavourful enough but again lacking any kick whatsoever and too sweet.I know that not all Thai food is supposed to be spicy but because the flavours are so big, it does need to be balanced. Perhaps the menu is designed for people who don't like spicy food (even the menu descriptions only go as high as medium spice) .Portions were relatively small and prices fairly high.Very good and attentive service which was reminiscent of Thailand.Overall it was a good experience but not the high end Thai experience I had hoped for. This would be a 3.5* rating for me.",

We enjoyed the tuna tartare, gae pad grachai, srangwah hoy sheli, nua tom kati, and the gati sod sundae. I enjoy their usage of tart and spicy flavors. I love how the nua tom kati melts in your mouth with a meaty coconut taste. I loved their use of exotic fruits in my dessert. I enjoy the realness of their flavors.

To which we also received the complimentary prawn crackers #hmmhmmhmmmm :) very hospitable service.The decor is Thai inspired, romantically dim and not too loud.Now onto the reason you are here, food... Every course was delicious! Delicious in smell, presentation and of course... Taste!The flavoursome dishes had us reminiscing the explosion of flavours and smells we met in Phuket.The chicken and prawn satay sticks were soft, juicy and not oily. The peanut dip made the commute through London worthy!The lamb was cooked well. The meat literally slipped off the bone, whilst the Prawn and pineapple curry was perfect! Not too sweet, nor too coconutty. The portions are very generous, if personally recommend two rice portions per person.Great value for money. All in all the experience was superb, we will return soon.Kop kun khurp!",

If they can serve a side of chili sauce it will be much better in my opinion. Soup is ok I had better ones in the States. One thing I frowned upon was the smell on their water cups. It has dishsoap smell. Not sure why, I smelled two cups both had some odor.",

I come here for the Massaman Lamb Shank - it never disappoints - its slow cooked, the sauce is an exotic mix of spices, herbs, coconut milk, and the lamb just melts off the bone. The marrow in the bone itself is also delicious. (I recommend using a chopstick to get it out or simply sucking works -ish)The milky Thai Ice tea is also quite breath taking. For myself this might be as close as fine dining as i ever get - because yes its expensive, and generally I don't enjoy spending loads on food because my mind always suggests - its never worth THAT much!? But once in a while I splurge - also I tend to come here only when I am celebrating something so I usually am in a great mood.I also enjoy the waiters and waitresses uniforms - its quite slick, and I feel like I am in Bali which is weird because I have never been but its what I imagine the restaurant staff would wear (although Bali isn't in Thailand..!) I love to love Patara - in small annual doses.",

    "text": "Our first time at Patara was for dinner before the theatre. The ambiance is pleasant with soft warm lighting and plenty of staff being just-the-right-amount of attentive. We had two starters, both of which were fresh, flavorful, and delicious: Chor Muang, lilac dumplings with caramelized chicken and peanut; and Goong Sarong, spiced marinated prawns in filo pastry served with avocado, tomato, pickled cucumber, and greens. Both starters were excellent, but we were really surprised by our main dish, which turned out to be the best Pad Thai we've had. (We live in San Francisco, where there are many, many good Thai restaurants.) We saw many other dishes pass by that we'd love to try, so I imagine we'll be back here on our next visit to London.",

I haven't really had good thai food before, so having Thai food at Patara may not be a good thing after all because now the place raises my bar. I love love love the soup(forgot the name but it's white broth)and the fish curry. Pad thai and the chicken curry were also good but the pineapple rice was ehhh, not the best.I would definitely return to Patara when I visit London another time and try other dishes in their recommended dish section. Oh get the thai tea too!",

    "text": "Food - 3Service - 4I think I've just been spoiled by all the fantastic food in the States because from what I've experienced, you just can't find the same level of deliciousness for the same price point in the UK. Patara didn't contradict this theory - the food certainly wasn't bad, but also not remarkable either. The Miang Guaytiew was not quite memorable save for the lime and chile sauce, which I would've gladly drunk a bowl of. I'm actually drooling at the memory of it as I type this. I also don't remember what my main course was because the meat wasn't very distinctive in taste or appearance. I think I got the Gae Pad Grachai because I *think* I ordered lamb, except the meat didn't have the gamey flavor lamb often has, so it may have actually been beef. It was rather gummy. Again, not bad, but if I'm paying the equivalent of $30 for a dish I don't want it to just be \"not bad\"! I don't remember much else other than that it was surprisingly quite spicy. The pros: the interior is beautiful and the service is incredibly friendly! They made me feel very welcome.",

I'd recommend Patara for a nice night out, but if you need to satisfy a Thai food craving, you'd be able to get something nice at a more affordable place.The service was friendly but patchy. They mixed up our starters and forgot to bring one of the rices with the main and we were charged for an extra one once it showed up. Regardless, the smiles and light conversation from the waitress made up for it.I had the king prawn pad thai which featured two large prawns (see photos). It was tasty and presented beautifully but at \u00a317.50 for this recommended dish, it was a bit of a splurge for something you can easily get somewhere else for cheaper.Overall, my friends and I had a fun night, but my wallet came out a bit lighter than I had wished.

The fresh spring role appetizers have nice, but not great, flavor giving a sampling of crab, shrimp and duck but we were disappointed it didn't come with the classic peanut sauce (although they provided it when asked). Our entrees were simply delightful...I had \"pad siew gai\" \u00a0(wide noodle with chicken) which wasn't on the menu but they were delighted to make. The dish was not overly garlic, noodles were perfectly prepared, and it had a bit of warmth (spiceness) that didn't overwhelm the flavor. My wife had the calf cheeks in red curry which was outstanding....the tenderness of the meat was complemented by the red curry, green peppercorns, and other vegetables in a stew. The stew also had a nice warmth that builds over time. Lastly we shared a warm dark chocolate cake with mango sorbet which was perfectly prepared and brough a nice close to the dinner. The service was very good with the one exception of one of the waiters being a bit clueless and not paying attention to what we were saying. The waitresses however did a much better job. The other beef with the restaurant is that they charge a mandatory service charge...tipping should never be mandatory and frankly the servers lost out because I would have probably tipped more. Between the spotty service and mandatory service charge they lose a star, but looking just at the food I would give them 5 stars.",

    "text": "LOVED Patara! \u00a0- After walking like a camel for miles in London, all i wanted to do was to have a drink or 3 and have a great meal. \u00a0Patara delivered on both. \u00a0I had this amazing concoction the bartender whipped up and from then on I couldn't even feel my tired aching feet. \u00a0The wait was not that bad but I \u00a0really have to thank God for that because the line was like 20 people long and out the door but with the help of the rain gods and a little game of chicken (staring the diehards down) \u00a0poof the line moved to the italian place next door and our determination payed off big time! \u00a0After about 20 min. we were escorted to bar below and from then on ...magic. \u00a0Got a great booth and a great waiter - top this off with incredible food (we ordered and shared a lot so as to get a good sampling) and it was all consistently good. \u00a0We were tempted to come back again the following night! \u00a0 This one is a winner and I will go back again soon.",

I've been 3 times now and it's comfortably the best thai food I've had in London. It's not cheap (\u00a315 a main course), but worth every penny. I can strongly recommend the lamb shank in red curry which is superb - incredibly succulent meat, falling off the bone and beautifully flavoured. My only quibble is sometimes with the service. Last time we went we were in a hurry to leave and it took about 15 mins and 5 attempts to get our bill. Minor issue though, when the food is so great.",

    "text": "I have very high standards of Southeast Asian food... because I'm Southeast Asian, Laotian more specifically. Don't know where that is? Look on a map.Thai food is similar to Lao food, but of course not the same. My mother thinks that Thai food is always covered in coconut milk and fried and can be very fatty, whereas she sees Lao food as more herbal and a healthier alternative.We met up with some friends here a couple weeks ago. They probably assumed I would love it. They also said to expect 25 to 50 pounds per person...I have to say, that my food experience was okay here. Ordering 4 appetizers was enough for our party of 6. And they were all pretty delicious. I ordered the sea bass with a side of sticky rice. And when it came out, it was covered with coconut milk. I couldn't help but snicker to myself. But it was quite satisfying. My sticky rice (kaonew) was a little... too sticky. They served it in a porcelain bowl, which is surprising because it's traditionally served in a bamboo basket which helps keep it at the perfect temperature.I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place though. Most of the decor is wood, which is more traditional, and not gilded (like in most other Thai places). With perfect romantic lighting. So the atmosphere was very fancy, yet down to earth. I wouldn't mind coming back, as long as I wasn't paying.",

This is definitely the right sort of restaurant to go to if you want to experience 'Royal' Thai cookery. I can happily recommend the King Scallops cooked in chili paste and Thai basil. It is heaven in a mouthful. The deep fried sea bass with red curry is not a piece of installation art but a very beautiful piece of edible architecture. It is a gem in Soho's culinary crown.",

BEST. CURRY. SAUCE. i've ever frickin had. \u00a0it draped over the giant LAMB SHANK that was sitting atop the plate. \u00a0that shank was stewin for forevers, cuz the meat literally SLID right off the bone. \u00a0i almost was tempted to lick the sauce from the plate, so all that was left would be one long bone. \u00a0i oftentimes dream of returning to london just for this frickin lamb shank curry",
