The bar was quiet when we arrived but very busy by the time we left. The food in the restaurant upstairs was one of the highlights of our holiday. The pork ribs were finger licking good, the beef was some of the best I've had, succulent and to die for. Service was friendly and excellent - the young man who served us was more than happy to explain menu items and suggest good combinations when ordering sides. I wish we had one in Australia. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great meal with friends.",

They recently started taking reservations, so we made one just the day ahead and arrived at 11:30, when the restaurant was only half full. This place is known for bottomless brunch, but having had a late Friday night, we passed and I got an iced americano instead, which came served in a beer mug (the coffee itself was average). I was torn between the eggs benedict with pork belly and the beef rib taco, and I ended up going with the latter with a side of guacamole. I was served two medium sized tacos that were solid, but coming from California, probably not the best ones I've ever had. I thought guacamole should have been standard. My friends got the truffle egg toast, the roast corn & crushed avocado toast, and the buttermilk pancakes with bacon. I tried some of the truffle egg toast and thought that was outstanding and unique, and I was told that the pancakes were also some of the best my friend has had in a long time. The music got really loud and clubby by the end of our meal, which was not so great for catching up. I've had better brunches, especially where I can hear my friends and I'm not sitting on benches like a canteen, but they've done the food well, for sure.",

    "text": "The pulled pork was very juicy and tender with a hint of spiciness, very flavoursome and robust. But the star item was still the smoked pork ribs, once again it was sensational, it had a big smoky flavour with the perfect balance of sweetness, spiciness and saltiness. It was a very fine piece of rib and one of the finest I have encountered in London. To sum it up, Hotbox is a great BBQ joint but there are misses as well as hits, price wise it is not cheap with side dishes costing up to \u00a36.50 and the main cost anything from \u00a310 to \u00a324. A great addition to Spitalfields but not one that I will return in a hurry.",

We were 3 for dinner (with a reservation) and seated in a corner, directly under a speaker. \u00a0We had to shout to be heard. We asked a couple of waiters if they could turn the volume down. \u00a0One did and within a few minutes it was back up to the same level. We asked to move to another table when told by the waitstaff that they couldn't adjust the volume because their \"boss\" wants it that way. \u00a0The table we moved to wasn't much better since speakers were everywhere and everyone, including a large party of 15 middle-aged men next to us, were shouting. \u00a0Even my 26-year old daughter, who loves bars with loud music, hated it and thought this was unacceptable for a restaurant. What a shame since the food is tasty. The blasting music prevented us from relaxing, enjoying the food and making conversation. \u00a0My daughter lives in the neighborhood and will never return. \u00a0I'd like to point out that the diners in this restaurant were not young. A much younger crowd was downstairs, in the bar. So blast the music there, not upstairs. \u00a0Restaurants are noisy enough without managers (young ones, I presume) who decide that their customers should be to subjected to a noise level that rivals a club.",

    "text": "Not impressed, at least with the pork ribs.I've been on a barbecue kick lately, as it fits in perfectly in my LCHF diet, hits the \"taste of home\" craving, and is generally delicious. \u00a0So I've been working my way through the slew of BBQ joints around Shoreditch, and I stopped by Hotbox last night to get takeaway after a good rock climbing session.First off, there's a vestibule before entering the main restaurant space with two guys. \u00a0The first guy (a bouncer, I guess?) asks me if I have a booking. \u00a0No, I just want takeaway, please. \u00a0He directs me to the second guy, seated up a few steps at a little table. \u00a0\"Yes?\" \u00a0Can I get some takeaway? \u00a0Hang on, he'll have to ask if they're doing takeaway, as they're very busy. \u00a0OK, fine. \u00a0Goes through a door, asks a woman standing there. \u00a0Yes, takeaway is okay, what do I want? \u00a0Uh, I have no idea, can I see a menu? \u00a0Woman sighs, \"OK, but not everything is available.\" Not sure how I would have known that. \u00a0She retrieves a menu and rattles off a bunch of stuff that they will deign to give me in a bag to take home. \u00a0I order the pork ribs and corn. \u00a0It's the same price as a full sampler at another place up the street that I know is very good. \u00a0Hmm.I got my food home and dug in, and immediately noticed that the \"dry rub\" ribs were coated in sticky BBQ sauce. \u00a0\"Duh?\" I hear you saying, but I picked them partially because it said dry rub, which is more compatible with my diet. \u00a0Whatever, I can deal with some sauce.The next thing I noticed was that there was a ton of fat on the ribs. \u00a0The obvious ideal for BBQ is \"low and slow,\" which should render most of the fat away and let the rest meld with the meat. \u00a0Not so in this rack - there was a big globby layer of fat between strips of meat, so much that I had to grab a knife and excise it. \u00a0Read that again - I needed a knife to eat my ribs. \u00a0This is not a good sign.Finally, the flavor and texture just weren't very good. \u00a0There was a hint of smoke on the edges, but it didn't reach far into the meat, and overall the rib meat was fairly chewy rather than tender. \u00a0I don't need my ribs to completely fall apart, but these seemed like 2-hour ribs, not 16-hour. \u00a0On the other hand, the elote-style corn was very good, well grilled with tangy and flavorful sauce and an extra lime on the side. \u00a0No complaints there except for maybe the \u00a34 price tag.All in all, maybe I was spoiled by going to a BBQ festival in the States a few weeks ago and eating the real thing, but this just didn't live up to my expectations or the not-cheap price tag. \u00a0I'll be going back to some of the others on my list, but not Hotbox.",

    "text": "I first came upon the HotBox brand at various Street Feast events in 2014. Superbly BBQ'd meats with a great selection of pickled relishes to garnish. A real treat.I was excited to hear that in 2015, they were opening a restaurant on commercial street in Shoreditch. My friends and I visited as soon as we could and we were not disappointed.Super cool exterior, minimal signage, hard to find. A real underground, exclusive vibe. Waiting times were minimal but you always had to wait for a table. The underground street food scene was buzzing with the arrival of this place and it's patrons were flocking.Waiting was and is still no issue. The uber cool underground (literally) bar Forty Six & Mercy serving terrific beers, wines and cocktails. Relaxing, chilled vibe and a pleasure to wait a small time for a table to become available.The restaurant is, as many are, social seating but there is still plenty of room (and there needs to be). Portions and indeed dishes are very generous. Platters of meat of all varieties, chicken, pulled pork, ribs, burgers, all superbly complimented with terrific sweet potato fries and slaw.My recommendation then, as it still is, is to mix and match your dishes. Don't go too crazy with your \"main\" meat. Go small and add from the extras. My dish of choice, the pork ribs with a link sausage or pulled pork on the side. The slaw is a must. Heavily salted meats need to be accompanied by something to refresh and relieve the palette.First impressions were that this place was awesome. Terrific vibes, perfect food, achingly cool to the smallest detail (the bill would be presented with a small clothes peg). However......This was 2015 and we came and came and came back again. The experience never changed. Great food, cool clothes pegs bills, good portions etc etc but that's the reason I'd give this place 3 stars. It simply hasn't changed.The underground foodie scene has moved on and the city boy, tourist money has moved in.The menu is almost identical now as it was then. There is seemingly nothing fresh happening with this brand. Why change a winning formula I guess but other places mix things up from time to time and to be honest it will be to these other places I go until HB do something new.In a nutshell, go to HotBox. Enjoy a great dinner in a super cool restaurant. Then, move on and find the newest hot restaurant on the block.....",

They have pork ribs (4 fat pieces at \u00a316) or beef ribs (3 pieces for \u00a322) both of which are excellent, with just a little devilish fat stuck onto it to make the pork ribs juicy, and a very soft and tender beef rib which sort of melts in your mouth. Tap water came without prompt. I didn't like the chicken wings they felt a bit too salty. Sweet potato fries were yummy and not too greasy.The place is very chic and would be a good place for a date! Coat hangers abound all over the place (woohoo!), toilets are downstairs after you walk past a really pretty looking bar and bar seating area with comfy sofas and everything! There is even a DJ deck space in the corner!Service was slightly weird. The waitress came at the correct times to ask whether we needed help, if the food was good, or alternatively giving us a few minutes to decide on what to eat, but her face told a different story. It just looked like she didn't want to be there rather than the smiley happy waitress we would all love to have!All in all, it's a good place to eat ribs, but the price is slightly eye watering for a few ribs. (Take note though you will end up super full!)",

    "text": "I'm a carnivorous sort of person. Given that, HotBox could very well become my second home.My friend and I split the Smoked Selection, which included beef short rib, pork ribs, chicken thigh, sausage and pulled pork. Initially I was a bit disappointed as I had come for the pork ribs, but they were running low so they weren't offering them as a main by themselves. Two things made up for this though. Firstly, the waiter was very friendly and helpful and gave useful suggestions regarding what we should choose. Secondly, the selection meant I was able to try ALL the meats, which it turns out was a Good Thing. Particular standouts were the beef and the pulled pork, both of which were very moreish and divinely melty. The pork ribs were fine, though not actually the stars of the show. I also enjoyed the chicken, especially considering this is pretty much an afterthought for me in this kind of place.Very importantly, though, the ham hock pinto beans were RIDICULOUSLY good. I can't stress enough how revelatory they were. It's rare for sides to stand out, but in this case they almost stole the show. I would happily eat these on their own, maybe with some rice, for a fantastic meal. Also had the grilled elote (corn on the cob) - they were tasty as well.It's got a good vibe, great good, lovely staff and gets many thumbs up.",

The decor was dark, mood lighting to full effect, the staff were very friendly and obviously had knowledge about the food and were passionate but I felt they were a bit on edge and felt a bit rushed to make a decision to order from the menu. In regards to the food I went for the meat selection, while presented perfectly the food was nothing special.. I mean, the meat tasted good, but it tasted like meat I've had in any grilled place on kingsland road, the price was reasonable for the area. I'd go back again but it didn't blow me away like i expected it to do.",

From the neon light sign and minimalist decor to the crunch of the chicken, everything was on point. A friend and I popped into hotbox for Sunday brunch. There weren't any tables available but they have high tables along the windows which are perfect for people watching while brunching. Who doesn't want a boozy brunch right? Unfortunately, the 'liquid brunch' here is 25 pounds just for unlimited mimosas or other brunch-y drinks. Typically, I've been to places that usually include food and drink in their bottomless brunch. If you're not going to drink more than two mimosas, it's not worth it. We ended up ordering two mimosas each (saved a few bucks) and \"waffle chicken\". For a bit of an appetizer, we got fried pork belly. My diet definitely went out the window on this day lol The chicken was golden and crunchy and the waffle was done just right. It was quite fluffy and thick ( we ordered extra syrup) just like a waffle should be.HotBox is definitely a winner! I'll be bringing people here as my go-to brunch when they're visiting London!Keep up with my food & travel adventures - instagram.com/briyoumetr\u2026youmelunch.com",

My favourite was the taco, a very well composed little course.For the main course I ordered the smokey bandit burger with a side of sweet potato fries. This was a very tasty and well made burger. My colleague from America sitting next to me had a bit of a challenge eating with his hands, this was clearly a course you are expected to eat with knife and fork.

    "text": "Having just moved to the UK from America, I was a bit worried about whether the BBQ in London would be any good, but I needn't have been. We arrived on time for our reservation and was seated right away. The tables are picnic style tables with bench seats. We all started with a cocktail, there was just a small section of 4 on the menu but they were really good. To eat, I went for a selection of sides and had:- pulled pork - really good! Well cooked with a nice BBQ sauce- mac and cheese - another good dish and a reasonable size for a side- jalape\u00f1o slaw - good but it was dry, just vegetables. Some people also found there were too many spicy red peppers - sweet potato fries - a good sized portion for the tableThe price was reasonable and service attentive. We weren't rushed in any way and we stayed at the table for a couple of hours after for drinks. Would recommend!",

    "text": "I want to write so much about this place. But that will waste both mine and your time.So I've created a nice list to help you decide.Reasons for: Amazing smoked meats, amazing marinades, amazing original hot sauce, amazing hot sauce that is slightly spicier than original hot sauce. Good staff, water constantly topped upReasons against: Oily tasting water? (To be fair after getting topped up the water tasted normal). You will be slightly disappointed with BBQ from other sources.So in summary GO TO HOTBOX.PS. I will be back to try the Brunch menu. K, Thx. Bye.",

    "text": "Location: \u00a0A bit odd. \u00a0It's right on Commercial Street and from Aldgate East tube station, there isn't much to see on that street. \u00a0It's pretty grime-y. But it's a quick walk from the stations, so not bad. \u00a0But what else can you expect for East London? Atmosphere: \u00a0Ok - overall. \u00a0It was a bit too dark in there for my liking (the bar downstairs actually seemed brighter) and the music was SO loud. \u00a0I was there in a group of 4 of us, and we felt like we had to yell to hear each other. \u00a0Decor is very simple. Drinks: \u00a0small drink menu, but they have a great 7 or 8 beers on tap. \u00a0I love that they had a Meantime Red on tap \u00a0- so yummy! And good prices.Food: Excellent. \u00a0As an American, my BBQ standards are high. \u00a0And their Beef Short Rib was some of the best meat we've ever had. \u00a0Their bbq sauce is also phenomenal - and super unique. \u00a0Their pulled pork had great flavour - but was a bit greasy. \u00a0And their hot link was supurb. \u00a0Mac & Cheese was a-ok - lacked a good cheesy flavour. Overall: \u00a0Pretty good. \u00a0I'd go back as you get a lot of food for your money. \u00a0I think it'd be a great place for a big group of people to have a good loud time. \u00a0Their dishes are really large too - so great for sharing. \u00a0My husband and I split: \u00a0the short ribs, side of pulled pork, side of hot link and side of mac&cheese and it was too much for the 2 of us!",

    "text": "I am a vegetarian so this place specialising in BBQ and smoked meats does not seem like a great choice, however on weekends they cater for us veggies too with their brunch menu. Initailly i had reservations about trying Hotbox only because of the meat heavy menu but the swanky dark exterior made me think it was aimed at the city boy crowd, which is not really my scene but inside all that preconception was lifted with the rustic decor and super friendly staff. There were 12 of us sat along the long wooden table and though we all arrived at separate times food arrived all at once so that we could enjoy eating together.I had the Huevos Rancheros which is one of my absolute favourite breakfasts and this one did not disappoint with a rich spicy tomato base, runny fried eggs, creamy guacamole and densely delicious masa taco on the side. The portion was so generous I couldn't actually finish my bubbling cast iron bowl, but as always my friends were there to lend a hand.Most of the dishes were served on plain plates, or wooden boards tying together perfectly the simple yet stylish industrial feel.This place is well thought out serving up quality food I only wish I wasn't limited to visiting at weekends.",
