It's much more relaxed early in the week.- BYOB, great.- Also check out Lahore Kebab House, same standard of food without being so rammed.",

    "text": "If you want to avoid the queuing and hassle, make sure you arrive before 7.30, don't go in a large gorup, and try and aim for a weeknight. If you can live with these limitations then you will not have to wait hours for a table and the entire experience will be that much better. I love the food here, I don't bother ordering curries, instead I just get grilled meat, naan and rice. The naan is amaaazing! It's really buttery and tasty and I happily stuff my face with it. Obviously, the lamb chops are amazing. I don't know why I like them so much, because there's barely any meat on them and they vary from being painfully spicy to being virtually mild, but I love them! They're truely addictive, though I haven't gone as far as some who only ever order the lamb. I also like the tandoori chicken, which is much better than the dry flavourless stuff you get in most places, and the tandoori fish is also amazing. If going for a lassi, get the mango or sweet. I accidently was given the sour one last time, and it is disgusting. They put in whole seeds (coriander? I don't know) and it's just rank. Stick with sweet, or bring your own. Btw, don't come here on a first date. Wait until you've been together long another to be comfortable shouting across a table and gnawing on bones. Also, if you're with a companion who only ever orders korma at Indian restaurants, maybe avoid here and head for somewhere on Brick Lane instead. Apart from that, go for it!",

It's only not getting 5 because one of our party was refused a glass of water whilst waiting in the queue - it was very hot in there and we had been standing for over 40 mins at this point. NOT impressed....Anyway - we waited for over ONE HOUR for a table. A whole hour of being squished in a queue with waiters shimmying past, hands full of sizzling hot platters. A whole hour of standing there as the spice filled air made my eyes smart slightly and fatigue was starting to set in.When we finally got seated (in the less manic and less cramped downstairs section of the restaurant) we ordered quickly as we were sooo hungry. 3 of us polished ofround of poppadumspakorachicken tikkaLAMB CHOPS - omg the LAMB CHOPS.

There was a line but it went quickly and since it's BYOB (with no corkage fee), we cracked open some beers while we waited on a table. We ordered the Tandoori chicken-ok, mixed veggie dish-good, lamb kabobs-great, another Lamb special-excellent, and the garlic naan was incredible. Order more than you think you'll want - it's thin and crispy but soft and chewy at the same time...don't ask, just order lots 'cause it's delicious.Prices are extremely reasonable (most dishes are 5-7 GBP) and easy to share. Service was good - our order came out in about 5 minutes, no joke - I recommend if you want some time to chill and enjoy those tasty Indian chips appetizer they bring out, you \u00a0might want to wait a second or two before the feast arrives.Nice atmosphere - not too fancy but definitely has a nice vibe and sophistication to it...great place to take out of towners or go with friends over the Brick Lane Indian restaurant-food-court-carnival madness.",

Another one of these East London restaurants that's living off the fumes of a former accreditation of excellence but fails to deliver. I would say the average customer was not raised on a diet of Indian cuisine so experiencing curry is an irregular event (being half-Pakistani I had the stuff coming out of my ears from an early age) and perhaps hard to quantify - my own gf exclaimed how a lamb masala \"nearly blew her head off\" so there you have it. I had a chicken karahi which was bland (real curry houses offer chicken thigh as is the tradition in the Punjab), the meat rubbery and unbelievably luke warm. My naan was stone cold and my Nan could make better pilau in her sleep. The place is packed to the rafters making it uncomfortable to relax - at one point I had the jacket of a customer dangling in my curry as he was squeezed along an overflowing line. Ok compared to the crap on brick lane people think this is epic but If Tayyabs was in Southall it would be EMPTY. Time to look for a better local curry or just stick to my excellent take out from Samosa.",

Oh, before I forget its BYOB, so come prepared. J and I could smell the Indian food about a block away. We walked in and the place was PACKED and since it was a Monday night at 8:45, we figured that with all these people here that we must have walked into Indian food heaven and we were right. There was a \"queue\" of about 20 people. So we queued up with the rest of the folks, but for some reason after about 5 minutes the guy doing the seating quietly asked us how many we were and when we said 2 he gave us a subtle head nod to follow him to a table. \u00a0Sure we were sharing a table for 4 with a couple of Greek guys, but that only helped in getting some tips on what to order and made for some good conversation. They also told us you can make reservations, which I would recommend. Ok, so now on to the food. While the samosas were good, I do regret wasting some stomach space on them, because the other stuff we order was absolutely outstanding. You have to get the lamb dishes, especially the lamb chops. We also order Lamb Karahi Ghost and Chana. I only wish we still had room for the Karahi Bindi (Okra). TheIf you're ever in London you have to get to this place for Indian food. One note of caution, don't wear anything you have recently had dry cleaned because you're going to come out of this place smelling like Indian food head to toe, but its well worth it.",

    "text": "Tayyabs seems to instigate very strong reactions in people who know of its existence, either really liking it, or disliking it. Their offerings are really simple and clear - a selection of Pakistani and North Indian appetisers mostly served on a sizzling platter, a variety of different curries, standard bread and rice and a small selection of drinks including a very generous sized lassi (I highly recommend the Mango one). They don't sell alcohol, instead opting for a Bring Your Own (BYO) licence so if you want wine or beer, you can really have whatever you want. Service for food tends to be very prompt, almost on the side of excessive eagerness and pressure to both order and clean up at the end. This is completely understandable when you look at the long queue of people inside, and often outside. One of the diners I was with found it a little on the rude side, although I think it just comes with the territory of the restaurant wanting to please all and is a way for them to keep the prices down. This restaurant is easily accessible from both Algate East and Whitechapel tubes, and just a small walk away from Brick Lane. I reckon it offers much better foods than many of the other places on Brick Lane, and made much better without the constant harassing or pressure to come and dine. This place knows what niche it fills, and that it doesn't need any more advertisement. Their prices are extremely reasonable and I've found their quality consistent enough to want to recommend to people who don't mind walking just that little bit further away from brick lane.",

Staff are all very polite and efficient especially considering that the fast paced nature of the place I imagine makes it pretty stressful to work in! Our waiter took orders from all 15 members of our party then recited it back perfectly and didn't mess up when it came to actually delivering it too!

(filed under 'Deserts' [sic])Considering that it's the same price as most bog-standard curry houses, Tayyabs is great. \u00a0Every single dish I've had here has been packed with flavour and despite all the detracting qualities of the place, I'm still always really excited to come back here - I'd be hard-pressed to name a better Punjabi restaurant in London. \u00a0I find that most 'institution' places are really not particularly worth the time or effort, but Tayyabs really is. \u00a0Except you've probably already been, so, well, whatevs.",

It was pretty cramped, but at least we didn't have to queue.The servers brought salad and poppadoms. The mango chutney was really nice, not too sweet and the red sauce had a nice kick to it. We ordered quite a bit of food (as usual for an Indian) but the best was the house speciality lamb cops and the saag meat. The curries were full of flavour and there was a lot of meat in each dish. The naan was super light and fluffy and was perfect to mop up all the sauce. We polished off all the food and although I was super stuffed afterwards, it was worth it.The only niggling point I have is that the service was quite rushed and I definitely felt like they were trying to turn tables over. There was a queue on our way out, but I would have enjoyed a bit of a slower meal. For the quality of the food and the price I will defo be up for making an East end trek for their curries again.",

But Tayyeb proves to be the exception to the rule.The wife and I booked a reservation here and after a long trip on the tube and a bit of self-induced (for Tayyeb) confusion about how to seat a bunch of parties that were queued up and raring to go, we sat down and had dishes, cutlery, and sauces plopped unceremoniously on our table. Having grown up with Cantonese waiters doing the same thing (but with much more insouciance), we weren't perturbed. Nor were we perturbed when we were told that they no longer did BYOB (great, another bottle of vino to pack for our trip back!). Nor were we perturbed when I asked for a fork and was given a knife (I ended up eating everything with a serving spoon). What did perturb me was the food. After such inept service and organization, I hoped fervently that every bite of the Karahi lamb chop masala, karahi gosht, garlic naan, and sikkh kebabs would be manna from heaven. Not so. They were all good- the garlic naan was soft, the kebabs were spicy and aromatic, and the main dishes were delightfully fragrant with a hint of heat. But they weren't that good. It certainly didn't warrant the long trip, the slack service, and the utterly self-induced chaos that marked the entire experience.Oh yes, that BYOB policy? Totally arbitrary. The table next to us pulled a bottle of vino out of their bag and was handed a corkscrew. Unfortunately for us, we had already finished eating. Psssht!",

They are not just hot but have taste - some curry houses offer very hot curry but sometimes it is just hot and I really do not feel the taste of meat, spices.... Tayyabs wouldn't disappoint you, I am sure.Don't forget to order lam chops. They are great. Although I love this place but there are things I have to say....- Air conditioning system. The air conditioning system keeps sending very cold air - it is very nice as you would feel very hot while eating curry, but it's a shame that the cold air cools the dishes as well...- Smell. I am sure you would smell very bad after staying this place for 30 minutes.- Too crowded. You may have to wait for 10 minutes if you seek for a table for 2, 20 minutes for 4 people....- Some people find the curry is too hotYou need to bring bottles if you want to have alcohol. Don't worry if you forget to get one as there are many local off licence, and Tayabbs",

Yup, it's packed and every seat in the restaurant is filled. If you don't like crowds, you may be uncomfortable... Get ready to rub elbows with the strangers next to you. Luckily, the two times I've been, I haven't had to wait more than five minutes for a table.I've tried a few things and all were actually quite tasty. Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Karahi Chicken, Lamb Chops, and Garlic Naan. You really can't go wrong with anything you get and if you're starving when you get seated, you are in luck. The food comes within minutes of ordering, it's amazing! Be careful because everything is piping hot and sizzling when it gets to the table. Dipping the naan in the curry is my fave and I always leave stuffed to the brim. It's a fast-paced restaurant, there are plenty of servers but they're typically running around and in a hurry so don't expect all-star service. I like this restaurant... it might be a bad thing that I live walking distance to this place.",

And BYOB is a marvelous way to enjoy your perfect beverage while dining here.Stand out to me was the na'an, of which I would recommend you order at least one per person. The texture was something like a lightweight, delicious pizza crust.Our dining party also found the vegetarian options very pleasing. I also discovered a few things I might not have otherwise. Like Indian candy dessert! I recommend the one that looks like a mess of orange Twizzler. Delicious.Seating situation is weird at this restaurant. Almost all tables are somewhat communal and if you're not comfortable sharing a table with strangers, the crowds they permit to snake around your table pac-man style while waiting will probably feel somewhat overwhelming.Worth noting, however -- I'm not ordinarily a huge fan of Indian food and I really liked this place.",

    "text": "There's usually a wait for this place, which signaled to us that it might be a place worth checking out. (That, and our host whom we were renting a flat from had recommended it.)We walk in and were lucky enough to wait only about 5-10 minutes before we were seated in the downstairs seating area. Note: the downstairs is DARK. I could barely even see what I was eating. We decided to order the chicken tikka masala, chicken keema, garlic naan, and a jug of mango lassi. It seems like only another five minutes pass before everything is brought to us. Super fast service always raises a red flag for me -- either the kitchen is extremely well-coordinated or everything is pre-made and reheated.Either way, the flavors of the food were decent enough, although it wasn't quite what we were expecting. Whenever we've had chicken tikka masala before, it was served in a creamy, thick, and rich sauce. However, this chicken tikka masala was soaked in a very oily and thin sauce and didn't taste as good as others that we have had (mainly because you would get a mouthful of oil with your chicken). The chicken keema, naan, and mango lassi were pretty tasty, though. For a party of two, we probably shouldn't have ordered a jug of mango lassi, but it seemed to be the better deal as opposed to ordering two individual glasses.All in all, I've had better. Maybe the Bay Area has spoiled me too much, but Tayyab isn't the absolute worst. The flavors are strong and definitely have potential. The service, though, is a bit rushed at points (re: food arriving five minutes after we ordered). I understand that there's a waiting list of customers, but that doesn't mean that the customers who are seated should be given a quick meal and shooed out the door.",

I agree with another reviewer that this place looks more like a nightclub when you first arrive with blue neon lighting outside and crowds of people waiting around. \u00a0 I wasn't really expecting to see this after a 10 minute walk though the backstreets of whitechapel.We squeezed inside and were invited to join the end of a long queue, however we were seated after 10 minutes when a small table for 2 opened up. \u00a0 I realized the place is BYOB after sitting down and immediately noticed groups of people in the queue drinking wine/beers/cider straight from the bottle. \u00a0This is definitely not your standard Indian restaurant and seems like a large party was about to break out at any moment. \u00a0 If you after a quiet night i would avoid this place... that is unless you don't mind lots of lots of noise, waiter squeezing past the queue carrying various plates of food over your head and people knocking your jacket from the back of your chair multiple times. \u00a0The wife got the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala, however, i blindly asked the waiter to recommend something that was very spicy like a Vindaloo. \u00a0This turned out to be a huge mistake and i quickly had food envy whilst seeing the waiter deliver plates of sizzling lamb chops to satisfied looking customers all around the restaurant. \u00a0This appears to be their specialty! \u00a0Damn i should spent more time reading the yelp reviews beforehand. \u00a0The Chicken Tikka Masala was very good whilst my Vindaloo inspired dish was just OK but this is not what they specialise in.We were surprised, upon receiving our bill, however, \u00a0when the total came to just over \u00a320 for the 2 of us including mains, rice, naan and sparkling water. \u00a0Combined with the bottle of wine from Tesco, this was the cheapest dinner i can remember having in London.On another note, the service was a little sketchy and it was obvious this place was focused in turning around tables, more than providing a fanatic dining experience. \u00a0It was hard to communicate with our waiter to get recommendations on what to order, we asked for 1 bottle of sparkling water and he seemed annoyed when we asked to send the 2nd bottle back, my main arrived and we had to remind him after 10 minutes that he forgot to deliver my wife's dish (appeared he forgot to tell kitchen), at this point i sent back my spicy dish as there was no spice. \u00a0Finally when the check came our waiter told us we had to pay cash, then after we didn't have enough to cover the bill, he said that we only need to pay the tip in cash. \u00a0however, in the confusion he put a \u00a35 tip on the card terminal and when we asked him how much our bill was he seemed to get our bill confused with another table. \u00a0So we left another cash tip in the confusion.... Anyhow, at these prices you have to left allot of this drama slide.",

    "text": "So another first for me on this move to London! Tayyabs was quite an experience. I've learned to leave my preconceived notions back at home, so I went with no expectations other than be prepared to wait. This place is a family owned restaurant since 1972 and its reputation follows. Whether it is a good or bad reputation, it has it a reputation because of all the years in business.As a first timer I thought the food was decent, but not great! The king prawn shrimp and masala fish were both overcooked, but the spices were good. We also had the Kema naan which was excellent. And the chick peas dish was also very good!The Mango Lasi was also delish and very helpful to ward off the spice. As I said before, if you go with the understanding of the following list, you'll enjoy the experience. -there's a long wait-the restaurant is a production line so get ready to get in and out once you've sat \u00a0down-bring your own alcoholic drinks and openers so you don't have hunt down the servers-servers are not too attentive because they're running around taking orders",

When we did finally get seated it was at a table in the walk way, so for the duration of the meal I had to lean forward slightly as there was a crowed of people standing in line behind me, having to make way for the serving staff.Service was fast and to the point, I have no complaint with this. \u00a0Food came quickly, but was piping hot and fresh. \u00a0Again, no complaint here. \u00a0Taste was good, but no better than any other Indian I've been to, it simply was nothing special. \u00a0Price is on par with any other Indian restaurant, about \u00a335 for 2 people.I thought it strange all night that everyone in the que was drinking cans of beer. \u00a0It was only when I sat down I noticed there is no drinks license so it is bring your own alcohol. \u00a0I do not want to bring my own alcohol anywhere. \u00a0A night out for me is relax, order a few at the bar, not stop off at an off license before the venue. \u00a0On reflection now, EVERYONE in the restaurant was drunk.IMO the restaurant gets this busy and has this much hype because a. it is cheap and b. you can bring your own alcohol. \u00a0So it's just being used by people on a night out as a feeding and drinking ground. \u00a0Definitely not suitable as a quiet, romantic evening.Nothing special, far too chaotic, would not visit again. \u00a0DOES NOT DESERVE THE 5 STAR RATINGS IT IS GETTING.",

    "text": "I think I must be missing something here. Tayyabs seems to be about the most hyped curry place but, as far as I can see, it deserves nothing of the sort.Firstly we had to wait for half an hour to \u00a0be seated. You are made to wait in the restaurant in a long line. This would be fine if there was actually any space but you have to put up with waiters constantly barging into you as they try to serve those already seated. I'm not averse to waiting but it better be for something special. When it was finally our turn we were shown to seats that hadn't been properly reset.Poppadoms and chutneys came straight away after we sat. These were a trio of a spicy chutney, a yoghurt dip and mango chutney. The poppadoms were good but the chutneys were questionable. The mango chutney was very watery, and lacked a bit of flavour. The yoghurt dip had a very slight taste of gone off yoghurt, a little bit sourer than is pleasant.The menu at Tayyabs is small. Generally this is a good thing in my opinion. I would much rather a place does a few great dishes rather than loads of average ones. Unfortunately they couldn't even manage that. The caramelised onion in at least one of the dishes we ordered would probably be more aptly described as carbonised. The mutton curry was tough - it just plainly hadn't been cooking long enough.Worse than the errors in the food were the wait staff. They would walk past and seemingly shout at us \"Service good?\" without making eye contact or waiting for a response. They were also desperate for us to hurry up and finish eating, having to be sent away 3 times as they tried to clear our plates before we had finished. I understand that they're busy and need to turn the tables over but we weren't being particularly slow and had in fact arrived after our neighbours.I really don't get what Tayyabs offers above any other curry place. I can't really think of any redeeming feature, other than the price of about \u00a315 a head.",

Unfortunately, I had just gotten sick and my nose was so stuffed up that I could only breathe threw my mouth. I know smell has a lot to do with taste, but I have never experienced a complete lack of taste due to a stuffy nose until that day. Needless to say, as a foodie, this may have been the most depressing day of my life. I sat there, watching my friend gobbling up the lamb chops and curry, as I slowly chewed on what I could only know and feel to be meat - but could not even taste AT ALL. I think I almost cried. BUT *light shines* I had the pleasure of returning just a week later when my nose was all cleared of mucus...when I practically devoured my food! Making up for lost times, gnawing off any spec of meat on the bone. If you enjoy lamb, I would say the lamb chops are a must. It comes out on a sizzling hot iron plate and makes your eyes bulge as they follow the plate to another table...you think, \"Whatever that is, i'm gettin' it.\" The curries are also yum and the 3 sauces on the table are DELISH.Anyways, Thanks Tayyabs for showing me just how truly important the taste of food is!",

With all the reviews I heard I was expecting to be impressed. The food wasn't that great, way too overrated. Tandoori lacked much flavor and the lamb I had was just ok - nothing special. The biggest contribution to the low score was the service. The waitstaff are rude. They put popadoms on our table, along with a salad. Little did they tell us they charged us for the popadoms. When we told them that we didn't order it, they said they asked us if we wanted popadoms, and they put it on our table. Here's the thing: the never asked us if we wanted popadoms. Even if we said yes, we would have assumed it was complimentary, as bread usually is at most restaurants. Instead they got rude with us, got into a fight with us over 3 pounds and left us with a bad taste in our mouth about the restaurant. We ultimately paid, but I would not recommend this place to anyone, ever.",

Excellent prices as well.My only complaint--while the spices and flavours of the lamb chops were amazing, 3 of the 4 chops that I received were incredibly fatty, to the point where I got only 2-3 good-sized, non-chewy/fatty bites off of each piece.

Following from that, we waited for around 30 mins for someone to take our order and only after asking a few times, did we finally manage to order. I might add, it took a lot of staff members asking each other to take our order, which was a little strange.The food arrived and was fairly ok. The fish dish I got, had plenty of bones, which wasn't great. The saag aloo was amazing, super spicy and a great addition to the meal. My friend got chickpeas which were nice and a great side dish. The chicken tikka for me didn't live up to expectations.All in all, the meal was just average and I felt like the service could definitely be improved next time.

    "text": "My sister recommended this fantastic place that did lamb chops some time ago, and I'd utterly forgotten about it. But then when it came to introducing a former school friend of my wife to his first Indian cuisine experience, having looked around the Brick Lane area we came across Tayyabs - and lo and behold, it was the restaurant my sister had recommended some time ago.Booking online was easy, and we got a decent table in the restaurant. The menu isn't extensive, which personally I take as a good thing because it means the restaurant doesn't just have a fridge full of pre-made sauces that they add to things. Having been on holiday in India, I can usually tell the Indian from the Anglo-Indian and this was much more towards the former than the latter. The restaurant is bring your own, which my friend did and it was no issue - they do sell soft drinks though.So for the food. We ordered a lot, and it was surprisingly cheap. All in all it came to just under \u00a350 for three of us, and that was with three starters, two mains, two portions of rice, two bread, a vegetable side and soft drinks. Oh, plus poppadoms - but you literally couldn't have fit another plate on our table. The paneer tikka was delightful, I'd made the cheese from scratch before and I can tell that either Tayyabs did, or their supplier makes it very fresh. It was just spot on, and there is no way it was from one of those relatively hard paneer blocks you get from the supermarkets.I didn't try the lamb chops, but for a starter it was a huge portion and my friend said they were good. The samosas were a star - probably the best I've had, and obviously home made rather than the traditional tightly bound triangles you get in most restaurants. The garlic naan breads were covered in a generous volume of butter, and the sauces on the tikka masala and the lamb dish were delicious. This isn't your standard Indian as it is more authentic than the normal Indian restaurants - but not so authentic as to feel like it is utterly alien. I would recommend that you book as it gets very busy (and loud!) but it is well worth it.",

I ordered the following items: Mutton Grill (3.5/5)Lamb Chops (3/5)Chicken Tiki Marsala (4.5/5)Garlic Nan (3/5)Mango Lassi (4.5/5)The lamb chops are ok, but tough and hard to get off the bone. I ended up having to use my hands which was not great. Mutton was also very tough and overdone. The chicken tiki Marsala was great but came 35 mins after the first dishes. The food seems to come out at a completely random order. People who ordered after me were done before I got my second course. This place is also a very obvious tourist hotspot. In the 1.5 hours I was there, 90% of the people visiting were American tourist. I happened to be sitting right next to the door and being American myself, I noticed the distinctive accents. Overall this place is ok but the staff needs more training and the food needs some work. I would come back but skip the grill and try more curry.",

Be prepared to wait, and sit in tight quarters next to a full table of Indian men, business people, East enders or any of the above. Once your food arrives, none of the seating or crowding will matter anymore...just the smell of the sizzling, smoking dishes is enough to delight and satisfy! \u00a0And no, the total on the bill is not a mistake.",

    "text": "To many Tayyabs is the best curry in the East, and it turns out these many are pretty much on point. A lingering Sunday hangover and need for some comforting full stomachs sent us in search of a curry and what a choice we made. First thing to note is this place is known for being busy, and I mean lines out the door for several feet busy! Friday and Saturday night be sure to wait for a while but Sunday evening was perfect, table of 5 was snapped right up for us, joy. Secondly, and even better, is that this curry house of fully BYOB with no charge for corkage. Such a good idea and with a little Tesco 2 minutes walk up the road you can supplement any feast with a cheeky tipple or two. So on to the food. The menu is vast but it's vast with good options, incredible platters and starters with a good array of sides and little delights to grace the table top. Like any good curry things were kicked off with some poppadoms and personally I judge a curry house on the mango chutney. Tayyabs was on point (again), slightly chunky but a good flavour and a decent portion that 5 people could easily tuck into. After some discussion (sometime heated, due to the hangover) we decided to let our server do the hard work and decide for us. The service is fantastic and they really treat you well once in the door, so we had no issue with the waiter bring us his best picks. A few round of poppadoms later and here it was, a feast of epic standards and proportions. The curries and accompanying naan bread were all amazing, the smells took all of us to food heaven and conversation ceased as the next 20 minutes or so were spent eating ourselves into a solid food coma. Some top picks were easily the pork chops. I've heard this place was known for them and I would more than recommend getting them on the table. Huge chunks of tender pork in a beautiful spice mixed. Pork tends to dry in other locations but no sign of this. Other picks were 100& the garlic naan (no explanation needed) and the chick pea side. The BEST chick peas i've had, each one was as soft as the other and they almost melted in the mouth. The sauce was like a Bhoona but a little less spicy, and the after taste almost creamy Korma like. A little tip that we found, the curry and sides are so good that we didn't even touch the rice, just went straight for the hard stuff. Yes, this could be the hangover again but I'd seriously think about letting the dishes doing the talking and drop the rice. Get full on meat not carbs (little life lesson for you there).In all we left happy, well fed and well served. This place is a must and I write this in the cab on the way there. I'll see you in the line. Job Done.",

The wait for a table can be up to an hour and without a bar, or anywhere to rest, this can be tedious. It is worth the wait. Don't be put off if, you will only regretting not eating here.As I have previously mentioned there is no bar here and this in turn means no booze. BUT, this only means one thing. BYOB.Bring some beers and a bottle of red and you're in for a smashing evening of the finest grilled meats East London has to offer. \u00a0I'd go for everything and anything grilled. The last time I was here we literally had one of every grilled starter to share amongst three and it was plenty.Great value for money with the bill, for three, coming to \u00a340. Fabulous place.",

Well marinated, but not as juicy and tender as it could be, in fact close on the dry side. The service definitely needs improving, took ages for the somasa to turn up, and he still got it wrong. As we tried to tell the waiter what exactly we ordered, he walked further and further away. The funny side he still got the order wrong and had to go back. It was very busy again, and the noise level just kept going up and up, It definite a vibrant atmosphere.",

It's a terrific place for the following reasons:- Cheap (average cost per person is under 20)- BYOB - keeps costs low and allows you to have tons of booze with your food- great for groups - Tayyabs is huge and has plenty of room for groups 10+- Good food - Usually when I eat in groups I'm disappointed with the quality of the food. However Tayyabs bucked the trend by having quality, tasty food in large portions.Therefore if you want to have a good time out with a large group of friends, this place is perfect. Please note it's very loud so be prepared to shout across the table. (not the best place for romantic nights out or quiet dinners with the parents!)",

    "text": "I wanted to go to Tayyabs as I'd heard sooooo much about it from various sources. However I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. We got there and we were sat down fairly quickly which was good, in the middle of a line of tables for two people. The tables were very close together and I could literally rub elbows with the person next to me, so I felt a little boxed in. We opted for paneer tikka, chicken tikka, lamb chops,masala fish, baby chicken masala and a garlic naan and a Coke. Let's just say, we were hungry. The person who took our order didn't write any of it down. When the drinks arrived it was a Diet Coke, not a normal Coke, despite having specified normal Coke. After asking three different people, they changed the Coke over so that was slightly annoying. The paneer came first and I was excited about it as paneer is one of my favourite foods. However I was really disappointed. The paneer was rubbery and hard and bland. Paneer is not supposed to be like that, it's supposed to have a slight rubbery texture but this was hard - I found it difficult to cut through with my knife and fork! The chicken tikka and the lamb chops slightly redeemed Tayyabs. They were both delicately spiced and cooked really well. The meat was really succulent and tender. Really tasty. The masala fish was really not my thing. I didn't like it at all however my dinner companion did so it wasn't all bad. When the naan came, we looked at it but didn't realise until we tasted it and realised that it wasn't garlic naan. However the two of us just couldn't be bothered to send it back as the last time we tried to send the Coke back, they took forever. The baby chicken masala was very tender and cooked really well but I wasn't overly keen on the sauce - it was a bit bland. Maybe it just wasn't to my taste. Overall my opinion of Tayyabs wasn't great. I thought that the service was poor, the food was okay, not the best Indian I've had and I felt that the seating was quite intrusive. But I do understand why people like it, it's affordable, tasty(ish) Indian food where you can BYOB!",

    "text": "I do understand why other people may be gaga for Tayyabs, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.I had an old school friend visiting from the States who'd never had Indian food. As we eat Indian a fair bit, and recently did a cooking class in Goa for a week, I decided this must be rectified immediately. I wanted to be able to show him Brick Lane and the environs, but I knew the restaurants on Brick Lane can be a bit hit-and-miss. I'd heard great things about Tayyabs though, and they had online booking, so it was an easy choice.We arrived at 7pm on a Friday for our booking, just 3 of us. We kept trying to say we had a booking but they weren't interested as it wasn't crazily busy (Ramadan fasting time). They took us up to the top floor and we got a table right away. It is definitely close quarters but okay.The menu is quite short, and as our guest didn't know what any of it was, really, I just went ahead and ordered - a lamb dish, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, rice and garlic naan, along with some paneer tikka, lamb chops, and samosas to start. Our guest had brought a beer, so I asked for a bottle opener, and we ordered Coke.The food came out pretty much all at once, except for the paneer which was first. My favourite foods of the night were the samosas and the paneer. I didn't try the lamb chops, and our guest only had one, so I think he wasn't blown away.I just didn't care much for the curry, to be honest. Not a huge amount of flavour and a bit oily.The garlic naan was more like a garlic bread from Prezzo, swimming in butter. The service wasn't rude but wasn't attentive. After we'd been there about an hour, it started getting really, really loud. This was easily because of the amount of BYOB that the tables around us had - they were well on their way to being wasted. We made a pretty swift exit around this point.The upsides were that we all left full, nothing was *bad*, and we spent under \u00a350 for a silly amount of food. A good spot for a tourist to feel authentic, but not so much for someone who has more time and choices.",

Atmosphere was great but a bloody great shame the food did not match said atmosphere.Tayyabs suffers from the age old problem that all south asian restaurants suffer: the curries are all cooked in the same base sauce! There's no authenticity or uniqueness to an aloo saag when compared to a chicken karahi! The food is made to cater to an audience that is either not asian or are so drunk they can't tell the difference between authentic indian food and a restaurants budget-cutting variation!If you're a brit asian like me, you can get better food at home!The mango lassi and sizzling mixed grill starter are banging though! Must try both if you come here. The expenditure is also easy on the wallet!",

The queue was short considering. There was only 4 of us so a little easier to seat. The place was rammed! After about 20 minutes of waiting we got a table. The vibe in the restaurant is similar to crowded pub, very loud and hectic. Service was ok, we felt more like a hinderance than paying customers.

Menu inside left is \"medium\" heat/spice dishes with ZERO description of contents, menu back is \"mild\" heat dishes, their medium=hottish and mild=medium the spice/flavour enhancing sauces at every table are great5. Only been once but I think parties of 4 are the magic number as there was an INSANE no-res line (40+ at least, no I'm not including take-away order waiters), but we were seated before our entire party could even get to the end of it and the 4some seated to our right had the same experience.6. American Yelpers EVERYWHERE, I think Brits/Euros are more TripAdvisor peeps, disappointing, I know.Totally worth the walk into the hood. I recommend The Commercial Tavern on Commercial Street (.7 miles NW) afterwards.",

    "text": "I'm just going to be straight up with you: I cannot tell you what my husband and I ate at Tayyabs. Wait... I stand corrected. Lamb chops was one of the dishes on the table. That's all I know. You know what else I know? This place is LEGIT. Located in a not-so-glitzy part of London, it's a true gem that only locals know about. We dined with my pal Lizzie G and her lovely boyfriend Al -- man, I'm so glad she made reservations for us here. I was a little uneasy at first (Indian isn't a cuisine I gravitate to normally) but knew I was in good hands and to just trust Lizzie.Like Kathleen M says, it's hot as ever in here -- even on a relatively cool evening. Body odor wafted through the air, but (thankfully) the smell of curry mostly covered it up. Lizzie wasn't kidding; we left reeking of curry (in a good way) and sweating like whores in church.We were lucky enough to walk in with reservations just after 7pm, but by the time we were done the line was wrapping around the block. It's a rushed service too... they obviously don't want you lingering.So here are a few things I learned:1. Bring your own libations, and don't bother with anything but screwtop bottles2. Ask what's in the dishes and don't be afraid to order them3. Be prepared to take home food. Lots of it.4. Drink the fruit smoothie they give you to help with the spice.5. Leave your quiet voice at home. Yelling isn't optional to hold a conversation.Lizzie, thank you for a wonderful Tuesday night dinner. We loved it!",

You will never get the knife you request and your neighboring table will never get the serving spoon they request. Just roll with it. You will be awarded with very good Punjabi food at reasonable price. Be warned that this place is a LOUD and crowded volume operation. Try the chicken keema and sweet lassi.",

We were sitted not too long after we arrived in a long table upstairs. Looking around a lot of people were in the same situation as us - big tables, lots of joy and celebration. The place is noisy, there are tons of people but it is a fun atmosphere. The menu is big with plenty of naan, lassi, meat, rice, veggie options. When the waiter took our food and drinks order (for 12 people) and did not take any notes I started ohh no I see it coming it is going to be a disaster. But he surprisingly remembered it all. ImpressiveThe salty lassi was perfect - not too cold. And the chicken and veggies were tasty as well, not too spicy and on the big portion side. Maybe a bit too oily for my taste.The food is very good value for the prices. It is a busy place (book in advance) so it was hard sometimes to get the waiter's attentionFYI it is BYOBIn a nutshell: I don't often go to that part of London so I am not sure I will get the chance to go back but if anyone asks me for Indian/Pakistani recommendation I will make sure to mention Tayyabs!",

For me it was love at first smell - but reading through some of the other reviews I can understand why others may not have fallen under the Tayyabs spell. You need to be clear about what you are getting here and what you are not.....the foodthis is Punjabi food and the grill is where all the action is. Mixed grill on sizzling hot plates - the aroma cutting through the air - I love that smell - if they bottled it I would buy it. The lamb chops are the highlight (they really are the best of all the punjabi restaurants I have sampled) and the seekh kebabs suitably spicy. Mutton tikka, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori all are good. I have worked through most of the menu over the years and to be honest I only really order from the starters and breads these days. The curries are ok here but I have other favourite places if curry is what I am after. I seldom am. Seduced by the punjabi grill......a carnivores heaven.the atmosphereIts heaving with queues snaking through the restaurant and outside. Every night of the week. Its packed - tables are close, spread over three floors. Its loud, its hectic, its great fun...perfect for groups if you book ahead. Not somewhere for an intimate first date or romantic night. \u00a0We like the ground floor best and the round table next to the kitchen is our favourite if out with the kids. This is our go to family birthday restaurant - the kids are big fans of the chopsthe realityyou will wait to get in even if you have booked - bring some cans for the queue and just accept it...it helps if you know the managers (and we do now). You will be rushed through your meal if you let them - the food will be out quick - order your food in two batches if you want to linger a bit...once you have finished eating then they need that table and the hot towels will reach you before you have cleared the last bite from your plate. Its not somewhere to spend the night. IT is BYOB - no corkage charge - bring in whatever alcohol you want - there is no charge - makes this place a seriously cheap places for a night out.New Tesco Metro has opened at the end of the road - perfect for picking up alcohol.My favourites: lamb chops, seekh kebabs, masala fish, some tikka and a vegetable karahi (sometimes) plus lots of the delicious roti. Really good breads. How I love the great Tayyabs!",

Its easy to reach there anywhere from 4 zones via underground.Tayyabs serves almost authentic North Indian food (1 star removed for not being 100% authentic). I have visited Karim's in Old Delhi by Jama Masjid, which by far serves the most authentic North Indian food; Tayyabs is not quite there. I believe that the cooking method is similar but the spices are on the mild side.I had ordered Peshawari Naan (sweet stuffing inside and quite loaded with butter), Bhindi Gosht (Okra, mutton in spicy curry), Chicken Tikka and Sheesh Kabab. Peshawari Naan was interesting but too heavy (oily) for me. I would have just ordered regular Naan, which could have been more enjoyable with curry. Bhindi Gosht was really good but a bit on the mild side. Gosht was tender and cooked perfectly to absorb spices. I highly recommend this dish, which I believe is not offered at many other Indian restaurants. Chicken Tikka and Kabab were tender but again on the mild side. I would definitely go back to this place but ask to make everything spicier.",

We were not disappointed. Though the place was jam packed, the staff never forgot about us and the food was delicious. The fact that its not full of white people flocking to try the famous east end curry houses was music to my ears. I would book in advance, but is definitely worth a go.",

    "text": "The Short: The food here is spectacular. The price is even better. Only one thing left to say: get the lamb.The location of this place is a little tricky - it is situated off of the main road in a somewhat difficult to find location. While the surroundings are not exactly the most bustling part of the city, the restaurant itself is quite busy most of the time. In fact the place is often very crowded - be prepared to be up close and personal with the people dining around you.However if you don't mind the coziness, then the rest of the experience will blow you away. While the service is nothing extraordinary, the prices are extremely cheap, which is a welcome sight for London diners on a budget like myself. The food was exceptional - everything we had was very good, although the lamb was far and above the best.A couple of caveats though: First, they don't serve alcohol so it's BYOB (which, frankly, I see as a plus). In case you forget this, when you get to Tayyab go out the door and turn right. Walk a fair distance and you will find yourself at a store that sells alcohol, on your right. Second, the line can be quite long so be ready to wait or plan ahead and send one of your more amicable friends to hold your place.",

The waiter seated us on a table we had to share with another couple even though there were plenty of free tables. When we asked if we could move to one of the free tables he just said that they are reserved for larger groups. It took another 10 min before we got the menu to order. Even though there are almost as many waiters as customers, the service is very slow. We then ordered some kebab and a curry. I don't understand anyone can rave about the food there. The kebab was dry and overcooked. The curry was ok, but really nothing special. It was a bit bland and the sauces have clearly been watered down. The only good thing was the mango lassi. The prices are also higher then you would expect for restaurant in this area and especially for this quality of food. Our overall bill came to 40 for a lunch for 2 with nothing fancy on the table. I wouldn't go there again and certainly cannot recommend it. Not sure who is giving all these 4 and 5 stars here. To sum it up food is average at best, service is rubbish, prices are too high for the area and the restaurant itself is nothing special neither.",

The line, which we had not been expecting on a Wednesday night, put us off, but not before I realized how close I lived to Tayyabs and made myself a deal that I had to come back, even if I had to make up a reason (as if \"I'm hungry\" isn't a valid reason...).In April, I was in need of a great place for a group of friends to have dinner, and someone suggested Brick Lane. I mean, Brick Lane is cool, but come on: 195 reviews and a 4-star average? We're not going to Brick Lane; we're going to Tayaabs.For six people, we demolished four dishes with naan for about \u00a310 per person. We brought our own beer and wine, and only left because the table turnover is so frequent that a big party needed our table next. I hope they had as good of a meal as we did. I'd definitely say this is one of the top Indian restaurants in London, but if you don't believe me, you've got 195 other people telling you the same. TRUST THE MASSES.",

Do be warned that it can fill you up deceptively quickly.It loses a star in my opinion as the service has gone downhill in my estimation. No sooner have you had your last bit of food the waiters seem overly-eager to get you out of the door to make way for other customers (which are usually are queuing out the door).

The waiters are attentive and very quick with their service, even if slightly rude at times but it is understandable when you're dealing with a bunch of large rowdy groups!Now to the food! We ordered their special - dry meat with sides of saag paneer, dahl and peshwari nan. The meat was lamb and it was truly fantastic. Cooked to be perfectly tender and juicy, it went down a treat and I couldn't get enough. The sides too were delicious, the only downside however was that there wasn't enough paneer in the saag which was a slight let down but in honesty I just cannot fault this place for the taste, quality and authenticity of the indian food. I will most definitely be back to try some more dishes :)",

    "text": "Adding my voice to the choir to say that this was one of my most favorite meals ever. After leaving England at the age of 6, one of my most distinct memories was the unparalleled quality of kababs at the Pakistani restaurants there, comparable only perhaps to kababs in Pakistan and BK Jani in Brooklyn. When I came back to London as a 24 year old, I knew I wanted to taste the lamb again -- locally raised, which probably explains the immediate difference in taste.Tayyab's did not disappoint. We went with a large group and I just remember them bringing out one dish after another of sizzling meats, each better than the last and each leaving me wanting more. I especially remember the lamb chops and seekh kababs.When the meat itself is high quality, that taste shines through. Tayyab seasons it's meat expertly, prioritizing authenticity but maintaining an even hand, and the outcome is that the taste of the food pleases virtually every palate. Whenever I make it back across the pond, this is on my must try list of places and it should be on yours too.",

Well it got pretty no-frills after that (as advertised) where the meat was chewy and spices were a hit and miss. The pumpkin curry was not bad but still room for improvement. Now what irritates me the most is when they advertise mango lassi as a lassi when actually has no lassi like ingredients and is just a mango milkshake.I remember coming here many years ago and coming out satisfied by experience and taste and that's all gone down the drain.

The eating had been pretty bad, and we were all excited to be in a fun part of town. Someone did some Googling and found Tayyabs. Our group was made up of one passionate eater (me), one vegan, one person who had never tried Indian food before, and one person who was ok with whatever. Everything we ordered was stellar and delicious. Samosas, lamb curry, all veg dishes, the mango lassi, the naan...the tastes took my weary mind off of the difficult project I was in the midst of and transported me to India. Even the person who had never had Indian food before loved what he ordered. Damn good sign, right?I complimented the owner after we paid, and he said that he wished I would have told him that it was our first night eating at Tayyabs before we'd ordered. A few moments later, I ordered kheer (rice pudding) for the table, and when I went to pay for it, they wouldn't take my money. On the house. What a class act. After posting a photo, all of my Londoner friends, and friends who find themselves in London a lot, proclaimed their love for Tayyabs. So yeah, next time I'm in London, I'll surely be back.",

It was pretty damn good....mind you I'm no expert on Indian food, but I am definitely a big fan. Its menu is impressive. Yet, we opted to stick to the staples and started with their chicken tikka and their famous lamb chops. The chicken tikka was not too dry and offered a nice balance of flavor between the spice of the paprika and the bite of the garlic. The lamb chops were simply put, a signature dish of theirs so don't miss out.The kebabs are pretty balanced and well done, while the curries very good and the daal beautifully done. The pilau rice was refreshing, but the naan was clearly the winner. Get the tandori choice is traditional, but the garlic is pretty awesome as well.Service is a little lacking, but you won't be left in need. Plus, it is BYOB and it is incredibly helpful as you enjoy a great meal with friends. Definitely go with a group since it might not necessarily be a good first date spot.",

You maybe just coming for the food (well, definitely you are coming for the food!) but it is the whole vibe in the place that makes you enjoy yourself there.The booking system is somewhat confusing. They do accept both reservations as well as walk-in guests. There is a separate line for the two waiting lists. Yep, even if you have made a reservation there is a good chance you'll still wait 0,5h for the table. So come early!That said, there is an important hint if you are planning to dine there. But probably you already know it. The place doesn't sell alcohol, but it does not mean you cannot drink booze there. Simply arrive prepared with your selection of drinks for the night. You don't need to pay for opening the bottle. And it makes waiting for the table so much better :)And now to the meat. It is delicious. Even if you're not a big fan of far east cuisine (then what are you doing here?!) you'll find the right meal for you. The selection is quite decent. Everything seems to be prepared fresh, in front of your eyes, as the main dining room is right next to an open kitchen.Also for vegetarians there are plenty of good options there. I need meat to survive, so I wasn't paying any particular attention, but it seems you should be fine as well.They can also stuff you for the next few days as you can order any of the meals for takeaway.",

There was a huge line (INSIDE the restaurant) of people trying to get tables, including those who made reservations. Waiters were dodging around all the people with plates of sizzling lamb chops and steaming curry and I witnessed multiple near collisions that could have been disastrous. It was incredibly loud, hot, and rowdy- a bit overwhelming for my family who had just flown in from the States that morning. We were finally able to sit in a very noisy room, where we had to yell to hear each other. We ordered the lamb chops, chicken keema, dahl with eggplant, and garlic naan, and we thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes (especially the lamb chops!) and it is nice that they allow you to bring your own alcohol.

    "text": "Without a doubt, I had the best Indian food of my life at Tayyabs.When we got to Tayyabs, about 20 minutes late for our 7:30pm reservation, we saw a large crowd of people spilled onto the street, with complete chaos and pandemonium inside. The maitre d' was surrounded by several people angrily demanding why they hadn't been seated yet. I figured that we'd never be seated, but surprisingly, the maitre d calmly confirmed our reservation and sat us within 3 minutes of our arrival, while being chased around and accosted by other impatient would-be diners.We ordered the tandoori chicken, Karahi king prawns, Karahi mixed vegetables, along with 2 naans and rice. The tandoori chicken was the best I've ever had - juicy, flavorful, and spicy. The Karahi king prawns were amazing, in a deliciously spicy ginger and garlic sauce, perfect for mopping up with the naans. Tayyabs is BYOB, so we came prepared with a bottle of wine. We had a fantastic experience, and would definitely revisit Tayyabs the next time we are in London.",

When they served the food we had to wait 15 minutes for the rice. By the time the rice got served the food was cold and not enjoyable at all. I can say the food is VEEY good but as first experience I wasn't that excited",

It was less than 5 min from the White Chapel station and was pretty easy to find. You can actually make a reservation online. Definitely do so since there will be a line.Food is substantially cheaper than what I'm used to..- Chicken tikka: 5 large pieces of chicken breast on a sizzling plate for \u00a33.40- Seekh kabab: ground lamb, good seasoning, very tender, only \u00a31.10 each - Garlic naan: super buttery. The edges were bubbly and had a good bite - like a Neapolitan \u00a0pizza - Kahari mixed vegetables: probably the most disappointing - no distinct flavor and too oily - Lentils and lamb: the lamb was tender and without gaminess, and the lentil sauce was perfect for dipping naan Everything came with 3 house chutneys, raw vegetables (lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers), and house made papadams. Bonus: BYOB! \u00a0Bring your own bottle (they have openers) with no corkage fee.For the two of us, the grand total was about \u00a325 in the end, which is super reasonable since it would have definitely cost in California (plus tax and tip...). \u00a0The food itself was solid, but to me, it wasn't significantly more outstanding than elsewhere. \u00a0Warning: you will likely smell like sizzling plates / food when you walk out.",

I was also warned that all my clothes would smell like Indian/Pakistani food for a good while after.We made reservations, but that didn't seem to matter as people just mobbed the front desk and they served whoever they saw, rather than who was there first. A sure sign of a popular restaurant! Note that this was on a Tuesday night as well!There were four of us, and for starters, we ordered the lamb chops, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka. Everything was good, but the lamb chops were pretty amazing.For our mains, we ordered methi aloo gajar, karahi dhal gosht (lamb), karahi chicken keema, and the saag meat (spinach + lamb). The plates are a bit small, so plan accordingly. We asked for the karahi chicken keema to be extra spicy (since they said everything was basically mild), but they seemed to have forgotten. It was still good. My favorite was probably the karahi dhal gosht, which had lentils and lamb.In a word, their naan is AMAZING. Huge, fluffy and so tasty. We ordered three different types (regular, keema and garlic). All were amazing, but I liked the keema since it had meat.It's BYOB so stop by a deli somewhere beforehand to pick up some beers or wine.",

    "text": "I'd heard a lot before my visit here. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to the hype.Tayyabs is a cheap indian restaurant in Whitechapel. They have a great BYOB policy, so you can pick up some drinks from the nearby Tesco to go with your meal.There are some nice touches. When ordering the staff member will attempt to remember your order in their head. Given how busy they are, it's not a fool-proof tactic and the attempt to look smart often backfires as they'll often forget something from your order. The guys who are good at it however can indeed remember 16 diner's orders without getting anything wrong.Starters are brought to you table which you might assume are complimentary, but you're charged for the poppadums and dip. That's a big disappointing, but in fairness they do ask you if you'd like it first instead of just plopping it on your table.Order is quick and food brought to you table as soon as it's ready. Given the small table space fitting everything can be like solving a puzzle. The food is average. They're supposedly famous for the lamb shanks, but I wasn't impressed. The meat is tough and often burnt. The currys are small in portion given the prices. The starters are actually more filling. Definitely focus more on the naan breads than the rice, as again the portions are small.There's a lot of potentially like about Tayyabs. However when it comes down to execution. It falls flat. Prices are definitely reasonable, but it strangely still doesn't feel like good value for money after the meal. There are plenty of better places.",

The chutneys are not even nice ! When an indian restaurant has watered down chutneys and poppadoms out of a package you know you are in trouble. To be fair this is Pakistani owned so it's not true indian food to start with. Honestly I am baffled by the reviews raving about this place. I will never come here again. I brought my Indian Husband and his cousin and his girlfriend here and they said it was bad too! Honestly Do not waste your time here, there are plenty of better indian restaurants in London. This is one of those places where the reviews are misleading and disappointing. \u00a0I also had the lamb chops and they where just ok nothing amazing. My husband won't let me live it down that I dragged him and our guest all the way to this horrible restaurant. I am truly embarrassed with myself, there are hundreds of amazing other places we should have gone. I have now finally learned my lesson! never again Tayyabs.",

So flavoursome and even better ridiculously cheap for what you get. The menu is quite small but I believe that's were the trick is. Because of the small menu everything is cooked to perfection. All the curries are medium spiced, so if you need something mild it might not be great but anyone that likes a bit of a kick you'll love it. It is also BYOB which is great if you are trying to save pennies. The total bill for 8 of us, including lots of starters, breads, rice and curries came to just over \u00a3100, insane!

Yessssssss.Everything here is made to a precision in the flavor department. It's not too spicy, earthy, peppery, etc. It's justttt right! The mango lassi had the most amazing ratio of yogurt and mango. Too good for words.We had okra, chicken, and lamb curry. Out of the three, I'd actually rank the okra one the best tasting because of the complex mish-mash of flavors. The lamb was lamb-tastic. Pure lamb flavor within the curry sauce. The chicken curry was probably the least impressive, but beats out any other chicken curry I've eaten by far.Like I said, I have a new appreciation/standard for Indian cuisine because of this place.

Yes, the area looks very dodgy but it's still safer than many US cities. Just use your commonsense and caution. The strange looking people live at the Sally Army Booth House hence their presence. \u00a0 \u00a0For those not in the know, the foundry was where the US Liberty bell (currently in a museum in Philadelphia, US) was cast. But let skip to what Tayyabs is all about. It serves fantastic and fresh Pakistani food! However everyone knows how good it is. So I went a weekday to avoid the crowds and it was still very busy. So be warned first. However back to the food. Certain days have their specialities. I enjoyed two sticks of spicy minced lamb with a large side salad followed on by mondays special of slow cooked Nihari lamb. Two rotis mopped up the juices. It came to just 10 squid ahead! \u00a0 \u00a0While in the area take a look at the entrance to the Mosque on the whitechapel road. Its a beautiful example of Islamic architecture in a road that is otherwise very drab and dreary. Have the American forgiven us yet for the shoddy workmanship on their Liberty bell?",

    "text": "They only allow reservations 24 hours before going, the queue take an age before getting sat, the staff are rude and irritable but my god the food is good. A small dinner turned into a party and instead of two of us 5 ended up spending the night drinking there all the way to closing time. My American friend was blown away by the food and eventually sleeping on shoulder. \u00a0Always go for the lamb chops and a shed load of other stuff. The Lassi is great but not the way mama made it for me so it wasn't up my street but as everyone says Tayyabbs is an East London institution. :)This really is as good as it gets in terms of food, destroys many of the restaurants that cost three times as much. Theres a reason they have two floors and have queues going outside midweek!Remember its BYO so get wine or beer and drink away!",

Having heard about this place from my brother, we made a long trek out to whitechapel and were not disappointed.The kebabs, meats and daals were fantasting... a taste of home that you would never expect to find anywhere but home. And the price, you can't beat the price. Amazingly good value for money in London. There were 5 of us and we are our fill AND it still only cost of around 60 pounds.It can be very busy so be warned. Service isn't bad just very hectic so be prepared and don't be shy to order or grab the attention of the waiter. On a side note, they don't have license to sell alcohol, which works in their favour. Food is cheaper and people simply bring their own booze from the off license.We will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Oh Tayyabs, what has happened to you, eh? Another restaurant that has been hyped so much that it's gone to their heads. They don't have to give you great service. They can and will make you wait or seat you by the door. They really don't have produce great food. Because night after night, this place will be full and turning customers away.Your experience here will depend on the following;1. What time you arrive. Get here earlier to avoid queues and get something resembling decent service2. Where you're sat. If it's anywhere near the door then you'll be absorbed into the scrum of people trying to get in. If it's in one of the back rooms then you'll be out the way in relative peace.3. How much you drink (directly related to 1. above). The queue itself is a destination. People will be drinking their BYO alcohol whilst waiting to get a table. The longer you wait, the more you drink before your food. After 5 beers in the queue the food is going to taste just like a Sainsbury microwave curry, isn't it?4. How stressed the staff are. This also related to No 1 above. Get here early, or late, and you'll find your staff are happy to serve you. Between 7.30 and 10.30 they're robots screaming into walkie-talkies and throwing a plate of naan breads at you.I used to love Tayyabs. I've had a few great nights here. My most recent was a let down.",

Thousands of restaurants in London and she & her friends were there the same time me & my friends were!They're known for their lamb chops, which was good, but a little overdone for my taste. I prefer mine medium-rare and these were more like medium-wellHowever, the tandoori chicken ROCKED. And i seroiusly mean that. \u00a0Very juicy, flavorful, slightly spicy and just amazing. I could have eaten that dish forever. I'm always cautious with tandoori dishes coz they're more often than not...overcooked. Not these ones!I had the Shrimp curry dish which was a tad too salty. My friend had the Bindhi (lamb) Okra curry and that was very flavorful \u00a0We ordered 2 Tandoori Pratha...my fave. Naans are too thick and bready for me. Prathas are definitely the way to go!Mango lassi was good too. Reservations HIGHLY recommended. We came on a Monday night and there was a line out the door AND inside the restaurant (it was like club nite there)It's a tad more exp than other Indian/Pakistani places, but i thought it was OK. Also....for tourists/visitors/ Londoners who don't venture in ethnic neighborhoods....well, this place is in Whitechapel...it's a tad sketchy..which freaked out my friend who now lives in London but was from Hawaii. But really...if you've ever ventured into the Tenderloin in SF for amazing, cheap food...then this is just another Friday night for ya. \u00a0Definitely recommend (recommendation came from Londoner friend/ Yelper Jeremy H)",

    "text": "Tayyab's came highly rated from our friend who lives in London. We walked there from Brick Lane so we really worked up an appetite. He made reservations prior to our arrival and I can see how busy they get, even at the time we went which was not really lunch or dinner time. The food here is not the Indian type of food I am familiar with eating. We got some grilled meats Seekh Kabob, Lamb Chops and Chicken Tikka. We also got a mixed vegetable dish and garlic naan. They gave us papadam with some tasty dips. The garlic naan was exceptional. The meats, we asked if they were spicy and they told us no, but my hubby was sweating bullets! Overall, the spices used on the meats were very similar and I did not notice much variation in taste of the different meats. The veggie dish was very oily and I almost forced myself to eat it. I know giving back your food is not acceptable and I did not want to waste any money! So I ate it. Their website says Punjabi food and you can reserve online before coming in. I am sure this will save you some time. I would say overall the food was good, but nothing I would go out of my way for again. It's pretty expensive in my opinion. Compared to food in London its comparable, but for me it was a lot for what it was. I would be more curious to try the curry houses that are just down half a mile from here.",

When we arrived for our 6:30 reservation there was still a few open tables, but by the time we left around 8:30 the place was packed with a wait. And it was only a Monday! If you have a group, be sure to call ahead.The food was full of flavour and the selection was pretty good. We weren't too overwhelmed with the massive menu that many other places have. They even have the menu online so you can check it out ahead of time. We asked a few questions from our server and he didn't seem to have a problem answering them which we found helpful. Don't ask anyone else helping the room anything, they won't help you, well at least that was our experience. Their was a main man on the bottom floor and he was the only one we could ask questions to, order, or pay.I give it only 4 stars rather than 5 because they brought a starter after all our food came out and it was clearly sitting up in the kitchen because it was dried out and not hot anymore. Our breads also came out a little later than our mains so we had to wait for them to begin. So, nothing awful, just not the perfect set-up. The price is very fair and all together we are very interested in returning with a few more people so we can try a bigger variety of dishes.",

If I was just reviewing the food there would be five stars here. But I choose not to go there any more in the evening, because it's a crappy experience. You queue for ages, often an hour. Then you get squeezed into a seat. If you're unlucky that seat has the queue winding around you so your seat occasionally gets kicked while you're eating. The waiter is trying to be helpful but he's struggling, serving too many tables, squeezing through too tight a space. Then you're rushed out because hey there are 200 people waiting for your space. Go to tayyabs for lunch, but not at night. There are equally good places in the side streets, where you can have a lovely dinner time experience. Try Lahore one for example.",

A bonus was when I discovered that they had started taking reservationsSo, it was great to swan past the queue of people waiting to be shown to our table. Fellow London Elite Tirthankar D also joined us and he was able to help to navigate the menuTheir signature masala lamb chops were of course obligatory and we added some tandoori chicken from the grill. The curry section wasn't their strong point and we had a selectionThe lamb chops were very good - moist, juicy and succulent given some good charring from the grill and heavy with spice. However, the curries were meh with no strong defining flavours to tell them apartIt was a nice evening with fellow Yelpers.The lamb chops are great but there are better curry houses in London town",

However, one of the most overwhelming things that I received advice about was to definitely get Indian food in London.Lucky for me, my tour guide Yee Gan O. knew all about this and created a mini little Yelp meet at Tayyabs!This is in a location that's a little bit further than I expected in London, and was a little hard to get to via the Tube, but nevertheless I am super happy that I got to try this place because everything was AMAZINGLY delicious! Definitely have not had Indian food like this in the U.S.I loved their Naans especially because they had so many different varieties. I also loved the lamb, definitely a must and their curry was just mindblowingly good! I definitely feel like there's a lack of flavor now when I eat Indian food here in the US because it is not the same!",

We were seated in seconds and a given poppadom right away so we could munch while looking over the menu.Based on some over yelp recommendations, we ordered the lamb chops. (thank you for that). Amazing. We started with veg samosa and moved on to chicken tikka masala, kahari chicken keema, lamb kahari and Chana masala ( which might have been the best dish) rice and garlic naan. We ended the meal with a kulfi (which I've never had before - think of it as a spice-busting popsicle)Full bellies. Full smiles.",

    "text": "Trying to get a seat in this restaurant becomes a serious bonding session with your fellow man. Near on one hundred (it seems like it) people cram into the already fully sat establishment aching for a seat, just anywhere they can be handed a menu so the delve into arguably London's best Indian food can begin. It doesn't matter whether you have a reservation or not, you are going to have to wait if you come here in the evening, the place is packed to the rafters.We did have a reservation, and the waiter took us to our table (after waiting) where some of the seats were still taken be a small group finishing their desserts. He duly told is in a loud enough voice for those sitting to hear, that this table was ours once these people got up. Talk about pressure. 10mins later they were gone and we had our table. The calamitous nature of trying to get seated is an experience in itself. The queue never ceased at any point of our two hour stay.Now we were to the reason that this place is the most popular restaurant in the area, if not London. The food is absolutely sensational. The meat samosa's were stuff of legend. The peshwari nan was impeccable and the lamb chops... OH MY GOD - heavenly! I ate and ate, till I thought my inners would spill'th out. Yet I would not stop. I ate fish, mince, curry, rice, weird brown cake that looked like poo, but tasted like a small moist parcel of love. I drank fluffy mango lassi and water from the never empty jugs.If Jesus wanted to remake The Last Supper I'd take him to New Tayyabs. Non of that water to wine nonsense, this is BYOB. Tayyabs is affordable, the experience and atmosphere is something to remember and the food is sexy incarnate. \u00a0If you haven't eaten here yet, set a day, put it in your diary and go.",

We were in a rush, they'd thrown us at the end of a very chaotic line, and no one had acknowledged our presence for over half an hour. Then they fed us, and somehow that one star multiplied into five.The restaurant is located on the street behind Whitechapel. It has a modern, bar-like feel to it that actually exceeded my expectations for the decor. The place is kind of like a madhouse, with the line winding around tables and waiters dashing all over the place, but the food was so good that I didn't even care that the door swung in my face every time someone opened it and waiters kept bumping into me every time they passed behind me.After the excruciating wait, everything went pretty smoothly. We ordered meat samosas, lamb chops, kahari chicken keema, rice, garlic naan, and mango lassi. All of it was amazing. Sure, it was greasy and the portions weren't that big, but the dishes were reasonably priced, well-spiced, and incredibly filling. The service was quick and, contrary to my expectations, surprisingly polite. I would absolutely come back here again.",

However, because its so good expect to queue outside the door for a table if you havent booked (and sometimes even if you have booked!) and the waiting staff are always pretty stressed so can be abit rude.

I mean, I could not hear a thing anyone in my party was saying, but I could hear the random next to me screaming to his dining partner opposite. Friday lunch time was quieter, so if you are keen to go but want to hold a conversation, try a week lunch time instead.The waiters were friendly and accomodating, if not a bit distracted and distant!.The \u00a0food was so so, lamb chops were good, but have definitely had as good elsewhere (Delhi grill for example). BYO is always a winner. A \u00a0few things that let it down...I don't think it's good practice to place poppadoms, sauces & a salad down on the table without asking if it is wanted, then charge for it at the end of the meal. That's like placing a plate of samosa's on the table without saying anything and charging for it!ASK if we want to BUY/ORDER poddadoms or give them complementry!The rice was not good at all. It was gluggy, sticky and wet.The flavours weren't there either.The Karahi curries were nice, good kick of flavour, however, 3 bits of chicken in a chicken curry just isn't enough. There was more ghee than chicken.The naan bread was pretty good & fresh.I know it's an institution, it was probably fab back in the day, however, there are plenty of great places like it now in and around London to give it a run for it's money.",

Lovely lamb samosas, and chicken tikka pieces that were moist and succulent. For the mains we had chicken biryani (pretty good, not amazing), and chicken curry (lovely). The naan breads were perfectly cooked. They didn't serve alcohol so we popped over to a local Tesco for some canned beer (ergh!). The service wasn't fantastic, but I wasn't expecting much.

I was pining to try the lamb chops after hearing so many good things about them, but mine were only okay -- they seemed a bit burnt to me. The curries were good, but not excellent -- I would have liked a good deal more spice. The best part of the meal to me was sadly the pistachio kulfi I had for dessert, which was like eating frozen heavy cream on a stick.That said, for the food alone, I would give Tayyabs a solid four star rating, especially at such reasonable prices. The service, however, was appallingly bad. So bad that it affected the quality of the meal itself.The first shortfall came in that we had to ask to see a menu about 20 minutes after being seated. Secondly, my brother had to ask for a banana lassi at least three times (after the waiter reassured him that it was on the way) before one finally showed up about an hour later. After we got our bill, two more banana lassis showed up as a result of the ineptitude of the waiter.If you're in the area, Tayyabs is a great place to get some dinner. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. As an aside, they don't serve alcohol, so if you want a drink with your meal, you'll have to bring it yourself.",

The tikka paneer is out of this world, and the baby aubergine dish is consistently excellent. Don't get me started on the meaty starters my mouth's watering already. You can bring your own booze but don't expect to be able to get through more than a bottle of beer. One final touch which I like: tap water is provided as standard, and your jug will be topped up regularly.

    "text": "An absolutely fantastic restaurant with the most delicious curry in London. 100% authentic Pakistani/North Indian fare, this place far surpasses not only the tourist traps on Brick Lane, but other authentic curry houses in the same area. The starters are lovely and smokey and cooked to absolute sizzling perfection. Our samosas weren't too greasy and stuffed absolutely full of delicious, herby meat. The chutneys provided on the table are a great variety and wonderfully made (taste so fresh!). We also got a starter of paneer tikka (I've heard the chicken tikka is die for, but I wasn't in the mood for chicken that night), which SO smokey and deliciousobviously marinated in delicious spices and then freshly grilled, it was the best paneer I've ever had. The curries did not disappoint. After reading raving reviews, I ordered the dry meat & my husband got karahi lamb gosht. The dry meat curry is something everyone MUST try - absolutely nothing like your traditional British curry that is greasy and watery. The dry meat is called such because they cook the lamb in lovely juices and sauces so slowly and for so long that the lamb positively absorbs all that wonderfullness, leaving very little sauce behind (but infusing the lamb with SUCH flavour). It was absolutely divine and probably the best curry I've ever eaten. Next time, I am going to try some of those lovely sizzling starters I keep seeing described, but I am definitely ordering the dry meat dish again. Tayyabs also serve their trademark creamy sweet/salty lassi, which I hear is quite popular for cooling tongue unused-to spicy curries. Meal for 2 with 2 curries, 2 naan, 2 samosas, 1 starter: an UNBELIEVABLE \u00a319! Tayyabs is BYOB for drinks, so this helps keep the prices down a lot. Either get there early or be prepared to queue - this place is popular. Also, don't expect to linger over your food - with prices so cheap, they need a huge turnover of customers to make money, so don't be rude and stick around. Eat quickly, enjoy it, then leave so the next dinner can be blessed with some great food,",

We got off lucky though, as people that hadn't booked had to queue to join the queue! I think that is always a good sign when people are prepared to wait for hours for a table (the guys that sat next to us, just as we were leaving had waited for 2.5 hours!). Once seated we were asked what we wanted straight away, but hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. When we asked for a minute we were left alone for ages, amd became probably the only people all night that needed to actually flag down a waiter! We ordered our starters and mains, but everything came together. Lamb chops, chicken tikka and pakora were outstanding, as were the nann. The mains were ok, no real heat, but liked the use of tandor-cooked meat with the sauce, leavng the meat very tender.I wouldn't normally have given 5 stars, because of the service, however considering how hard they were working and the fact that the food was so good, I had to. The fact it was so cheap is also in their favour...",

Whenever you go, you find a long long line that snakes out from the door and for 50 metres beyond. It probably shows how popular the place is, but its such a turn off for a new customer.Even after you get the coveted seat, the ordeal is not over. The place is cramped, very cramped. You have to almost get up to let the server pass on to the table after you.But having said all this, one has to admit that the food, the non vegetarian food, \u00a0is excellent. The lamb chops are well known. The kebabs are heavenly, the chicken tikka or the fish dishes. The main course is also probably good (sorry, i stuffed myself with the kebabs and so couldn't try much of the main course dishes :p).The question is, how much trouble are you willing to take for the sake of tayyab's food ? I for one, probably will not go back very often.Full 5 stars for the food, and -2 stars for the pain.",

The neighborhood isn't quite exactly what you'd like to show off to your folks either -- hasn't quite got the character-filled, fun atmosphere brick lane has. BUT THE FOOD. OH THE FOOD. whereas brick lane can be hit or miss depending on which curry-pimp you listen to (and this can be very tiring), tayyab's is hands down tasty, inexpensive, and very accessible in terms of the crowd -- lots of types here, no need to be in a suit, nor hipper than you in skinny jeans. indeed i don't recommend the skinny jeans as this is the place to loosen the belt in terms of your tummy. the menu won't explain things to the unfamiliar (know what all the curries are ahead of time) but you may as well just close your eyes and point, you can't go wrong, or if you really want to be careful hope that you get one of their more patient waiters who might help clarify. the place is big and the turnaround fast, so pardon the speedy, cold service that's usually the norm. Long and short - under any other restaurant I wouldn't go back, because of how far it is and the service, but Tayyab's is SO delicious and INCREDIBLE value for money (30 pounds for four people, inc. drinks when i last went) that i would definitely just go ahead and plan a day around it. :-)",

It's a bring your own bottle (no corkage charge!) place & the food is truly wonderful & remarkably cheap for what you get. The place is always full, I've never seen it empty, even at lunchtime. It is a truly very bustly place with waiters running around at top speed. You do feel a little bit rushed but you can't hog the table all night I suppose. I've taken lots of my friends here & it has always been an excellent choice. It's one of London's best kept secrets & blows away any of the Brick Lane Imposters!",

One of the waiters was blaming the weather! 2, Mango Chutney was watered down - It was pouring off the spoon like water - not thick and gloopy. Manager infomed me it wasn't watered down and that they make it themselves. Any one who has worked in an Indian restaurant knows that you don't make Mango Chutney - you buy it in. 3, We ordered two curries - a sag gosht and a dahl dish. Both had onion skin in it! They both tasted horrible. I have eaten about 200+ of these dishes in my life time and never have I tasted such horrible dishes. 4, Manager was rude and unapologetic, to a point were an argument ensued They took the charge off for one of the curry dishes, not both. I had to ask them to take the poppadum charge off. The mixed grill was good but I thought it was not as good as Lahori Kebab House on Umberston Street. I would much rather go there. Edited to say: I am a critical person hence I have a lot of reviews here but I do give credit where it's due. Give it a try - I might have been very unlucky but at least the management could have treated me better.",

The mixed grill is what Tayyabs is famous for and it never disappoints! Within minutes of the sizzling plate landing on the table most of the food is gone. I suggest you book ahead as there are always queues. Tayyabs reputation has grown quickly due to its proximity to the square mile and once people try it they always come back and bring others. I recommend the mixed grill to start off with and then chicken Karahi with Naan bread. Also go for the Mango lassie as its a mango milk shake that is out of this world! Finally the best thing about Tayybas is it serves authentic top quality cuisine at rock bottom prices. A meal costs on average \u00a38 - 10 each!

The prawn karahi was incredibly zingy with coriander and again the spiciness was just right.

We didn't have cash but didn't want to step out in the freezing cold weather either so we stayed inside yelping other places near by. About 5 mins later the guy comes back to us and tells us we can go ahead and take a table and he'll \"figure out payment after dinner.\" It was a weird thing to say but we were starving so we didn't reject the offer. Food was fresh and made to order but it was just OK, bland for my liking and personally had better Indian/Pakistani food. We got Chicken Karahi was 2/5, it was not a normal Karahi, the Garlic naan was 4/5 (best thing we got) and the grilled chicken was 3/5 (was bland and not much flavor although it looked mouth watering). Overall, the place was just \"O-K,\" I wouldn't recommend it or go back but wasn't terrible either. Oh, and if you're wondering about what happened with our payment situation, well, they accepted our card after all (so I guess the either the machine wasn't broken to begin with and they prefer cash or a miracle happened while we were eating and it worked later).",

    "text": "Awesome Indian/Pakistani food in the heart of London. I am glad i made a reservation a week in advance or else it will be at least an hour wait. Food was finger licking good, spicy and full of flavors. We got the mixed grill meat platter (highly recommend it if you want to try everything), chicken tiki marsala, lamb curry, garlic naan, Peshwari naan, lamb chops, mango lassi popsicles, etc. Tip: Forget about your expensive cashmere or trench coat at home. Expect to smell like meat when you come out of the restaurant as the grill meat comes in a sizzling hot pan. Its so worth it tho. The waiter told us its cash only but they totally accepted our credit card. Not exactly sure why he told us that. Perhaps to avoid credit card transaction fees =P Just something to keep in mind.",

Those were simply heavenly. I can't even start to describe how good they were.I also ordered the Karahi Ghosht, which turned out a milder than I expected, but had a fantastic blend of spices and aroma.My experience overall was fantastic, and much better than the sought-after curry houses of Brick Lane.",

    "text": "I have to start by saying that the restaurant experience is not only the food that is being served, and I understand that this place is no fine dining but the noise level & stress wasn't something I could handle! We had a booking on Friday night & we walked in only to see that not only they have a full house ( the place is huge) but about another 50 ppl waiting in unbearable heat & noise & everyone was running after the guy trying to show him their reservation & get a table & he would tell everyone wait there 5 min! But it actually amazed me how he remembered everyone not having any kind of system!!Anyway we got a table after less than half an hour running after different waiters, all very friendly & attentive by the way even if they have sooo much to do!The meal came in a blink of an eye but it was not very pleasant to eat in that stressful environment & heat & smell from the open kitchen ( everything we had on, stinks now!) The funniest thing of all was the ppl that walked in with so much alcohol in their hands & then we understood that since they are not serving any alcohol everyone buys their own from Tesco just a min away. Prices was incredibly cheap but the food didn't impress me that much!",

With all the awards on the walls, I thought this would be mind-blowingly good, but we've had better Indian food from smaller joints. As mentioned in other reviews, downstairs they tell you the credit card machine doesn't work. When we were first sat, the host told us \"all you have to do is come upstairs.\" Once the check came, our waiter got very angry when we said we only had credit, and the guy upstairs said it was ok. Finally he allowed us to go upstairs and use their credit card machine which worked perfectly. This really ruined the end of the night.",

Well, yes and no. Yes, because you have to experience it at least once. The lamb chops kind of live upto the expectations and hype. 2/4 of our pieces weren't that well cooked and were borderline raw and chewy. Having said this, the marinate itself has good flavor. We also got the chicken tikka which goes very well with the grilled onions. Again decently flavorful. For entree, we got the Lamb Kheema and gosht masala. Both were good. Flavorful! Now, it's not worth it, because the food is just so damn greasy, that eat here once a week, and you are guaranteed to get a heart disease. It's just not healthy! Perfect for a post drinking night session!",

    "text": "For those in the know about the London food scene, it's not all about fish & chips and bangers & mash. Nay, it was actually chicken tikka masala that was declared Britain's national dish. Indian cuisine is oft enjoyed in London town and the Whitehall area is the place to go.After reaching out to a few local foodies and review sites, Tayyabs was highly recommended and we were not disappointed. The BYOB was bopping with the young crowd, dimly lit, bustling, yet somehow intimate. I appreciated that they brought out their branded water gratis. Perhaps they knew we'd need it for the curries to come.ChutneysA troika of chutneys were brought out including a spicy red chile with lasting heat, a white cucumber with slight chili heat on the finish, and a sweet, cooling mango chutney to save the day.PapadumSome papadum and a puffy rice cracker were on offer, featuring crisp, light textures. SaladA salad of yellow and red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, and lemon was also brought out.Vegetable Samosa [0.80 Pounds = $1.31]  We had to try a samosa, which was filled with savory potatoes and chickpeas, housed in a crisp shell.Lamb Chops [6.50 Pounds = $10.64]The lamb chops were definitely a showstopper and well-recommended. It's served smoky to your table thanks to the cast iron grill. In addition to the nicely developed char, the lamb was tender, moist, and delicious. Not at all gamey. The grilled onions added some sweet savoriness to each bite. \u00a0Naan [1 Pound = $1.64]In preparation for the curry, we ordered some naan, which was the perfect vessel to sop up all the impending goodness. \u00a0Chana Meat Curry [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]The chana meat curry was wonderfully fragrant and had great depth, with coriander and garlic permeating the roast lamb. The chana dal and the whole chickpeas made each bite even heartier and somewhat (only slightly) tempered the heat of this beast of a dish.Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala Special [7.25 Pounds = $11.87]Marinated chicken tikka, karahi masala, coriander, chopped tomato, sliced onions, chili The chicken tikka was moist and contained huge pieces of boneless chicken. The onions and potatoes mixed within were plentiful and the base of tomatoes helped to create a sweeter depth than that of the fiery chana meat curry.And as an attempt to soothe the lingering heat, our meal ended with some creamy milk chocolates.So, if you're ever in London, do pop on over to Whitehall and enjoy a proper curry. Tayyabs has got you covered on all fronts. It's also one of the better bargains you'll find.",

I never tasted lamb chops with so much Indian flavor, and I just couldn't have enough of them. We also had Samosas and Spicy Popadoms for appetizers and both were pretty good. For entr\u00e9e I had the Karahi Chicken Tikka Masala. Although it was very good, I'm more used to the chicken tikka masala being cooked with a lot of yogurt sauce, so it wasn't what I expected. It tasted more like a chicken korma to me. We also ordered a side of Keema Nan, but didn't care for it much.We also ordered a jug of their Mango Lassi, and as sweet as it was, we ended up finishing the whole jug.Overall, I liked our meal because it had so much flavor. If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back and try another dish. The d\u00e9cor was nice, and the service was ok.",

    "text": "Went for a lunch with my team from work. Had heard a lot about the place so all of us had a lot of expectation.The place is a short walk from Aldgate East station, and you can see the Neon signboards and unmistaken Tayyan's \u00a0facade from far even during the day.We got in as the lunch service was started and we were seated immediately. However, it was an horrendous 25mins wait before our orders were taken. We ordered \u00a0the classic Sheek and chicken tikka (gave the chops a miss) , paneer tikka for starters. And a Kadai Chicken, Dal Tadka and a veg dish with Garlic Naan for main. The food arrives reasonably quickly after that.The verdict - location was Ok, the decor nice, staff okeyish but isn't it all about the food? To be absolutely honest, I found the food quite ordinary with no dish meeting my heightened expectations. Sheek was nice but as my starter was the Chicken I had to eat that even though the meat was extremely dry/hard. Didn't enjoy it at all. The Paneer Tikka was soft and perfectly cooked. I hoped that he mains might change the experience but it didn't. The Dal was pretty ordinary and the Kadai Chicken was only so-so. The best main dish was the Vegetarian one, a Potato and Carrot curry with fenugreek leaves. The Nan breads met the standard then it is an South Asian restaurant. The desert in form of the classic Ras Malai would have been tastier only if it were served chilled. The bill came to around \u00a355 quid so it was a value for money but it missed hitting my mark big time.You wouldn't be greatly disappointed here, probably stick to the Lamp chops because many people swear by it but don't go in with a huge expectation else you might be pretty disappointed, just like me.",

    "text": "Why this place has such good reviews, I'm not sure. I've been to India many times, I've eaten amazing Indian food in London. Rasa, Dishoom, Woodlands, even our local Bangalore express in the city beat Tayyabs hands down. This is fusion food at best. I came here with my partner on a recommendation. We had a reservation but there was a huge line outside, which we took as a good sign. That said, it was quite annoying eating beside a huge line. If people don't reserve in advance, I think it would be reasonable to ask them to wait outside so as not to ruin other diners' experience.Popadoms and dips came to our table quickly, but everything else was quite slow. They were the best part of the meal.We ordered the paneer tikka, naan, rice, chana masala, pumpkin curry and paneer masala. All tasted overwhelmingly of pepper and every dish was extremely oily. The paneer tikka tasted bland, unseasoned and arrived burnt. Our naan was cold and chewy--not fresh. No complex spice combinations, no warmth, just a sharp peppery flavour. I wonder whether this place paid Lonely Planet or another guide book to promote the restaurant, because it certainly isn't even on a parr with the moderately good Indian offerings in the capital.",

    "text": "A Punjabi restaurant still running since it opened in 1972.The decor was modern and comfortable with it's leather chairs. Tables were of solid oak filled with a jug of water.Make sure you make a reservation. Even with two floors the place was quickly filled and a long queue formed. Noise levels got a bit high but service didn't let us down. There are so many waiting staff employed in a restaurant but they needed it here to keep things organised and in control.SaladService was quick. As we sat down, a free salad was delivered to us. It was simple. Not much umami from the tomatoes but at least it was all freshly cut. \u00a0PoppadomsAnother lady was very cheeky and placed a plate of plain and spicy poppadom in front of us and asked if we wanted it. We assumed it was free as well so took it until we found out in the bill that we were in fact charged 80p for one.Both were thin, crispy and light enough to enjoy before the meal. The spicy one definitely had a nice edge to it but not exactly 'spicy'. It came with three different dips to enjoy them which we didn't really use so can't comment.Vegetable samosaThe pastry itself was a bit more crunchy than I'm used to but it worked really well against the soft juicy filling. More flavours and spices seeping through each bite and becoming more and more apparent in its hear. There was some complex spicy savoury flavours and textures from the range of vegetables in there.Lamb chopsNot the most tender and some quite tough but I think it's all about appreciating the flavours here. It's obvious that these had been marinating for quite a while, releasing a rich in depth spicy kick as you gnaw on them with nice undertones of sweetness from the lamb itself. Great stuff for those who are willing to use their hands and teeth.Seekh kebabAnother item I saw on everyone's plate. These were incredible, packed full of spices and herbs. You can imagine the exploding sensation of all those different spices on your tongue as you slowly chew on it. It was incredibly juicy and tender and grilled perfectlyPeshwari naanDelicious stretchy light buttery bread filled with a delicious mix of minced up nuts, desiccated coconut and sugar. It was a great side dish to counteract the spiciness of the food with its nice mix of sweetness and nuttiness which is accentuated further by the roasted sesame seeds on topKahari chicken. Lovely caramelised onions offsetting a nice sweetness against the rich spicy umami tomato sauce. It felt like it had been simmering for ages from the complex savouries and spices I was getting. The chicken although a bit dry, took on a lot of the flavour in the process and there was enough sauce to aid it with moisture. Didn't waste a single bit of sauce and enjoyed it greatly with rice.Methi Aloo Gajar. Described as fenugreek, potatoes and carrots we were only given one piece of carrot. Nevertheless it was amazing stuff. Delicious chargrilled aromas throughout the whole dish being cooked in the karahi (small wok). The potatoes were incredibly fluffy, taking in the lovely array of spices and the fenugreek flavour which gave it a lovely rounded sweetness with a slight bitterness undertone.Saag meat. Sadly the lamb fails to remain juicy and bouncy inside. It became dry and rough on the tongue but it was still soft and tooth tender. It was more about the simmering process of all the spices, lamb and spinach coming together. The lovely creaminess created as a result of the overly wilted spinach, wrapping round each piece of meat, aiding it in moisture. They achieve something that usually requires cream but this was obviously lighter. Not overly spicy but enough herbs in there to keep your tongue buzzing in its complexityPilau rice This was lovely and cooked al dente. Subtle aromas of spices and not too buttery either.RasgulaA rolled up ball of an Indian soft cottage cheese, almost like a sponge soaking a vast about of sweet syrup inside, releasing it as you bite into it. It was incredibly sweet, texture slightly crumbly.RasmalaiAgain like a sponge but this time saturated with the milk its bathed in. Made of a soft cheese it was incredibly light and crumbly and gave it the ability to soak and release the sweet spice milk once devoured. The milk itself was delicious, beautiful aromas of cardamom, rose water and a sweet nuttiness from the pistachios.Great meal although things could have been better. Firstly they were quite sly in selling us the poppadoms by just placing it on our table. It's also a very loud place to make conservation. To keep things cheap they don't use the highest quality of meats which means some can be tough or dry. However there was nothing that couldn't be chewed through, just requires a bit of bite and patience. The quality of this restaurant lies in the rich marinates and flavours produced. It is all very budget friendly for the portion given. Might be a long wait to be seated but once in service is quick.",

    "text": "I went by Tayyab's on a Thursday evening (about 7pm) without a reservation. Everything everybody says about the wait is true. At 7pm, you'll wait about 20 minutes. Far more after 7.30pm. As you wait, you'll smell the smoky, burned-ish, foods going by you.The neighborhood is sketchy, by American standards, but quite safe. Once you're seated, the waiter comes quickly to your table to get your order (remember: you pay 2 quid for the bottled water on your table, another 1.50 or so for pappadam - rather tacky, but given that the rest of the food is really cheap, ok to overlook).I had the lamb chops, the masala fish, butter naan, and chicken karahi. The lamb chops are delicious, although a touch greasy (almost worth patting them down with a paper towel); the masala fish, honestly, was overcooked and a little too firm to eat, with not a lot of flavor; the naan was excellent, soft and buttery; the chicken karahi was also delicately spiced, but not too spicy.Don't go here if you're looking for fiery Indian style food. It's more nuanced than that. You won't walk out of here with a perspiring forehead and a burning tongue, unless you ask for extra chilis or sauce (why!?). Just enjoy it for what it is - a Pakistani/Afghani restaurant.My whole meal cost me 25 pounds. I think it was well worth it and would go back.",

    "text": "2.5 stars, rounded down for the overall poor experience. (A few friends later told me that this place was a tourist trap).Unless you somehow find yourself in this far eastern part of Zone 1, I would not recommend making a special trip to eat here. This place was recommended by a friend's friend. We had made a booking for an early Saturday dinner, and after reading plenty of reviews, I was definitely expecting poor service, but thought that the delicious food at a reasonable price would outweigh the service. I was also fairly excited that you could BYO here. So Hubs and I decided to take the long Tube ride over to Aldgate East. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a very long queue inside. We went to the employee who was standing at the front station to check in, but he told us that we had to talk to the man in the blue shirt, who was running all over the place seating people. After a few minutes of observation, we realized that we couldn't stand around and wait until he was free but rather had to chase this guy down. Hubs finally did, and he did seat us very quickly even though we were early for our booking.I wasn't expecting stellar service, but our server was curt and unwelcoming. He hardly acknowledged our existence. We ordered our food, and we made a mistake by asking if we could BYO. The server just said \"no\" and walked off. We didn't think that much of it, thinking that the restaurant probably recently stopped allowing BYO since they were so busy. So we just left our bottle of wine in the bag. Near the end of our meal, we spotted another couple seated next to us with a bottle of white wine on their table. At first I thought that maybe they had ordered it, but when we saw that our server dropped off 2 more water glasses and the wine opener for the customers to open the bottle themselves, we were peeved! Our server had the nerve to tell us no and then let this other couple BYO?! I know we didn't come here for the service, but at least treat your customers equally poorly? And apparently acting like a civilized human being in this place gets you NOWHERE.The food was good, but didn't knock my socks off or anything. I've had much better Indian food in San Diego. We shared 3 kebabs, the lamb chops, and a small karahi gosht (lamb). We only ordered 1 order of the garlic naan. We could have eaten another piece of naan, but since the complimentary chips were a good vehicle for dipping the sauces, we didn't. Our bill came out to around 20 euros, and we were full but not stuffed. I think we have a pretty high tolerance for poor service in exchange for delicious food that doesn't break the bank...that's how most authentic Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley in California are... but the extremely poor service really ruins a nice evening out.",

For a friend's birthday a table had been booked at the sprawling Tayyabs which is on a rather gentrified looking street in Whitechapel. You're certain you're going away from civilisation when you suddenly come across it! The seven of us sat and perished the unusually concise menu for an Indian restaurant. We'd all heard of apparently legendary lamb chops so three plates of these were ordered along with a wide variety of mains. The food arrived quickly and at boiling point and was very quickly devoured! It was delicious, flavourful, dynamic and most of all very satisfying without the inordinate fullness you can get from other Indian eateries. Another good point is that the restaurant is Bring Your Own Booze and there is no uncorking fee so feel free to bring all you need/want! For seven of us it was \u00a3111 which is pretty reasonable! Id definitely go back!",

Although the service is good, Tayyab is, in fact, rather average when it comes to the food, and quite poor when it comes to the dining experience: Expect long queues inside the packed place which makes dining rather stressful, with people banging on you and your chair every minute. Admittedly, there is quite a hype about Tayyab - but we cannot understand why. Is it the \"Time Out effect\"? Go see yourself - and find out that it is NOT worth going at all: You will find many Pakistani/Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants nearby, with a much nicer atmosphere and food of the same - or better - quality.",

    "text": "Tayyabs - Pics at The London FoodieI have wanted to go to Tayyabs for a very long time but for one reason or another, I never managed to get a table. On one occasion, a couple of friends and I tried our luck without a reservation - as we arrived there we found, as predicted, a very long queue ahead of us. After waiting for 20 minutes or so we gave up, and headed to the nearby Lahore Kebab House.Last Thursday, I finally made to Tayyabs thanks to the delightful Jennifer and Louise who miraculously managed to book us a table - never underestimate a woman's power of persuasion I would say! I had first met Jen & Louise at the Bangalore Express tasting a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to eating and catching up with both again.We arrived at Tayyabs to find the busiest restaurant I have ever seen - the queue was a tangle of nearly a hundred or so people huddled together, pushing and shoving and looking rather miserable. Despite our booking, we still had to wait a good 40 minutes for our table while others with no booking had to wait even longer.Our waiter was cheerful and well natured considering the number of diners he had to look after - he patiently took our order and assisted us to open our bottle of wine. Being a Pakistani restaurant, Tayyabs is a BYO restaurant which helps to make it an even more affordable choice.After a few minutes, two sizzling hot plates, piled high with a selection of the most beautifully char-grilled meats, arrived at our table - the smell was wonderful and we quickly tucked in. The meat was tender and had been perfectly seasoned. It was spicy without being too hot, and combined with the heavenly char-grilled flavours it made for a sensational dish.The selection of meats included \"chicken tikka\" \u00a32.80, \"lamb chops\" \u00a35.50, and \"sheekh kebab\" @ \u00a30.90 each. Each plate of meat cost \u00a311.90.To follow the grilled meats, we ordered two curries - \"Karahi Chicken\" \u00a36 and \"Allo Meat\" (Lamb) \u00a36.20. These were also excellent, as the karahi (like small woks), where the curries were cooked and served, had been blackened by the intense heat and were giving out that perfectly char-grilled aroma.To accompany our mains we also ordered a couple of the vegetable dishes, the \"Lahori Chickar Chana\" (chickpeas) \u00a34.80 and the baby pumpkin or \"Tinda Masala\" \u00a35. These were fried and served in Karahis, they were both deliciously spicy and had good flavours.We also had \"Pilau Rice\" \u00a32.50, the most scrumptious Peshwari Nan \u00a32.50 and a \"Garlic Nan\" @ \u00a32.As we brought our own wine, we only shared a large bottle of water \u00a32, and a very creamy and delicious mango lassi which \u00a32 was a real bargain. By the end of the meal, we were all too full to order dessert so we shared a couple of \"Kulfi\" (Pistachio ice cream skewers) @ \u00a32.50 each. The ice cream was sensational and I wish I had ordered a whole one for myself!My experience at Tayyabs has revived my love for Pakistani cuisine, its kebabs and curries. At \u00a367 for a table of 5 or \u00a313.40 per person, Tayyabs is incredibly good value. Despite the chaotic booking system and ludicrous queues, I cannot wait to return to Tayyabs and try all those dishes again.Verdict - Sensational grilled meats, wonderful Karahi curries and vegetables at very reasonable prices. I cannot wait to return. Highly recommended.",

Try not to come right after prayers either doofus.Nowadays it's always busy.Awards Awards Awards.Queues Queues Queues.Karaahi Karaahi Karaahi. (so good)Eat until you explode. The menu showcases a handful of the best curries. They're cheap, full of flavour and mostly lamb or chicken. No beef and no beer but you can BYO fourpack or bottle, just don't get rowdy and disrespect religion.It's well worth the effort of all the legwork, the queuing and the impossible parking in this area.

    "text": "Holy crap this place is AWESOME. My friend / local tour guide insisted we eat here as one of the must-try foodie adventures in London. I was not disappointed. With rumors of endless lines during the dinner time rush, we opted to do a lunch instead. Either way, just go. Sitting down at about 1:30pm, the place was full with people and still more coming in. Guess Londoner's take the late lunch mentality seriously. We got seated rather promptly though (thanks to my friend ingenious reservation making skills) and began to drool at the menu. Service is, well, a bit off. I can only rationalize it to \"your restaurant is so popular that your servers could act like a-holes but we'll still sit there no matter what\"... and we did. We ordered the: lamb chop starter, mutton tikka, chicken kahari, allo gosht, and some naan. Did I mention there were more then 2 of us although I could have inhaled all that food on my own. It was amazingly delicious and hearty. They did the lamb chops well (I am generally not a fan) and the mutton was ridiculous! Top it off with some BYOB action and I was a happy camper. Ended the meal completely satisfied with room for a mango kulfi. While it took about 15 min . for us to even get our check or for them to make change (again, service is questionable), I became an instant fan of this place and I thought the prices were REALLY reasonable.",

    "text": "Tayyabs - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I have wanted to go to Tayyabs for a very long time but for one reason or another, I never managed to get a table. On one occasion, a couple of friends and I tried our luck without a reservation - as we arrived there we found, as predicted, a very long queue ahead of us. After waiting for 20 minutes or so we gave up, and headed to the nearby Lahore Kebab House. Last Thursday, I finally made to Tayyabs thanks to the delightful Jennifer and Louise who miraculously managed to book us a table - never underestimate a woman's power of persuasion I would say! I had first met Jen & Louise at the Bangalore Express tasting a few weeks earlier, and was looking forward to eating and catching up with both again. We arrived at Tayyabs to find the busiest restaurant I have ever seen \u00a0the queue was a tangle of nearly a hundred or so people huddled together, pushing and shoving and looking rather miserable. Despite our booking, we still had to wait a good 40 minutes for our table while others with no booking had to wait even longer. Our waiter was cheerful and well natured considering the number of diners he had to look after \u00a0he patiently took our order and assisted us to open our bottle of wine. Being a Pakistani restaurant, Tayyabs is a BYO restaurant which helps to make it an even more affordable choice.After a few minutes, two sizzling hot plates, piled high with a selection of the most beautifully char-grilled meats, arrived at our table \u00a0the smell was wonderful and we quickly tucked in. The meat was tender and had been perfectly seasoned. It was spicy without being too hot, and combined with the heavenly char-grilled flavours it made for a sensational dish. The selection of meats included chicken tikka \u00a32.80, lamb chops \u00a35.50, and sheekh kebab @ \u00a30.90 each. Each plate of meat cost \u00a311.90. To follow the grilled meats, we ordered two curries \u00a0Karahi Chicken \u00a36 and Allo Meat (Lamb) \u00a36.20. These were also excellent, as the karahi (like small woks), where the curries were cooked and served, had been blackened by the intense heat and were giving out that perfectly char-grilled aroma. To accompany our mains we also ordered a couple of the vegetable dishes, the Lahori Chickar Chana (chickpeas) \u00a34.80 and the baby pumpkin or Tinda Masala \u00a35. These were fried and served in Karahis, they were both deliciously spicy and had good flavours. We also had Pilau Rice \u00a32.50, the most scrumptious Peshwari Nan \u00a32.50 and a Garlic Nan @ \u00a32. As we brought our own wine, we only shared a large bottle of water \u00a32, and a very creamy and delicious mango lassi which \u00a32 was a real bargain. By the end of the meal, we were all too full to order dessert so we shared a couple of Kulfi (Pistachio ice cream skewers) @ \u00a32.50 each. The ice cream was sensational and I wish I had ordered a whole one for myself! My experience at Tayyabs has revived my love for Pakistani cuisine, its kebabs and curries. At \u00a367 for a table of 5 or \u00a313.40 per person, Tayyabs is incredibly good value. Despite the chaotic booking system and ludicrous queues, I cannot wait to return to Tayyabs and try all those dishes again. Verdict \u00a0Sensational grilled meats, wonderful Karahi curries and vegetables at very reasonable prices. I cannot wait to return. Highly recommended.",

We ordered the mixed grill (which isn't on the menu but was a suggestions by one of the waiters) for an appetizer. The meat from this itself was worth the wait. After we shared a combination of meat and vegetable curries, getting a taste for lamb, chicken, and chickpeas. \u00a0The chickpea vegetarian dish was sweet and extremely good. I would definitely suggest eating in a family style way in order to taste a range of what this place has to offer. \u00a0A few hidden charges crept up on the bill, like the pakora they bring out without asking and the water bottle that sits on the table inviting you to sip when things get too unbearably spicy. \u00a0That being said, the bill was still much cheaper than anticipated. \u00a0With a byob status, we were able to enjoy wine, champagne and beers that we had brought ourselves, definitely reducing the bill by even more. A definite 5 star venue, but despite what people say about the line i would still make reservations first.",

Once the eons have passed, the sweat has changed your shirt into a tie-dye experience and you've run out of conversation, your party can enjoy a night of dining that would make a claustrophobic have a seisure as your calves rub roughly against one of the aforementioned couples. The meal appears out of the fog from the kitchen pretty swiftly, and then disappears almost as fast, before you are presented with a bill that would make rockafella wince. Then it's out into the night with you, to stumble home through the spit-laden streets of Whitechapel to burn the clothes you're wearing. Thoroughly enjoyable...",

If you go there I would recoomend the following , mixed meat starters but instead of the kebab you may want the tandoori chicken as it's haelthier.

We arrived at 7pm and were sent to queue as we hadn't booked a table and it was already pretty busy. We waited for about 20 min. People in the queue seemed quite happy to wait so we decided to stick with it. When we finally got to seat the whole experience was definitely worthwhile. Despite the occasional 'sharpness' of the waiting staff, the food arrived quickly and everything tasted fantastic. The chicken tandoori starter was moist and flavorsome, the tikka paneer was extra tasty. My highlight has to be the dish of the day (they change depending on the day of the week) we had the Karahi Prawn and it was cooked with fresh tomatoes. The mango lassi we ended up sharing (it was quite big) was delicious. I think the house speciality are lamb dishes but not being too much into lamb we didn't try them. Still we agreed that what we ordered was probably one of the best curries we've had in a long time. The bustly atmosphere was fun and the bill came to a very respectable amount which was a great way to end our meal. On our way out I have to say the air was getting a bit spicy and a little hard to breathe and the queue a lot busier but I'm pretty confident we will be back for sure (with a reservation!) and recommend.",

They want you in and out and no care is given to much else. My pregnant friend asked for a jug of tap water and was told she couldn't have it because we were seated downstairs and tap water was only available upstairs. She is 8 months pregnant! I am pretty certain the law states that tap water can't be refused, especially to a pregnant woman. After A LOT of arguing with the waiters/manager she was given glass and told that only she could have it refilled \u00a0by going upstairs to receive it! The food was average at best \u00a0I tried their 'signature' dry lamb chops which were overcooked and grisly and not nice at all. The music would burst loudly and at times was more like a disco. Main dishes were served 15 minutes before the rice and breads. I am really disappointed in this place. I've had far better asian food up Brick Lane and FAR better service.",

    "text": "Have been to this place a few times, food is amazing and as a Pakistani, i can say it is the closest thing you can get to a home-made curry. The biggest drawbacks however were the level of noise there - end up spending most of the evening shouting, the lengthy queues (a sign of its popularity) and the fact that they rush you out as soon as they sense you're finishing your meal. I like to sit for 5-10 minutes at the end of a meal and just chill for a bit but here they began taking my plate even when there was still some food on it. But overall, the quality of the food compensates for these drawbacks.",

The BYOB makes it easier for people to go a little over board sometimes. Next time I am back at Tayyabs, I gotta reserve the VIP room for our group of 7/8. Beware of the smell of indian food though, you will probably need to shower and quarantine your clothes/accessories when you walk out of this place. The food is unbeatable though, def. recommended for a yummy indian meal.",

A well known place in Whitechapel and a real alternative to Bangladeshi cuisine style in nearby Brick Lane, with a colourful decor upstaire and downstairs, it is always busy and yet you don't usually need to book though you're likely to be packed in close to your neighbouring tables; quite OK for the sociable.BUT \u00a0I have been there twice and this time the service was particularly abysmal. They hurry you up all the way through, despite the space they have and income they must be raking in, the waiters don't know much about the dishes they serve (well it's just a lamb curry) and you have to help youself to glasses etc when you feel you have bothered them enough already. Worst of all the bill included a service charge but they still asked whether we really wanted the change!",

He didn't say sorry, he didn't even look at her, he just stepped back while another server came, admonished him not-so-subtley, and cleaned up the mess and replaced the drink.While the food did make me momentarily forget all the weird shit, it still affects the general experience/high expectations I held for the place.

This place is very much like Khan's in Bayswater but a bit nicer inside. I also liked the fact that they had lassi in jugs, which was kind of kewl. So you can drink up a lot after the spicy food. One more kewl thing is, you can bring your own drinks.To wrap this review, i thought they had friendly staff !!! Good location and great for dinner.",

We ordered loads of different dishes (there was about 8 of us) The lamb chops and ribs were out of this world amazing! They arrive sizzling and so spicy you choke! (good thing for me I love spice!) The Tandoori chicken was lovely as well. Nanns were perfect and the King Prawn curry was exceptional! 2) BUT When I come to a restaurant its because I want to sit down, relax, enjoy my meal, calmly, no rush, no stress....This was a very stressful experience from start to finish. It was a Wednesday night and we had booked but we had to wait an hour for our table... outside. When we finally managed to squeeeeeeeeze our way in as I was sitting down i was PUSHED out of the way by two waiters on their way to a table. Not a good start. Its crammed full of people waiting. When you sit down you feel like the people waiting are your audience. The waiters were just rude, rude, rude. Not in the way like 'we are busy so we will be short and sweet' no just plain rude. The waiter seemed confused and annoyed when I asked for tandoori chicken with a side salad. What rice? no rice please. Salad? What do you mean salad? I had to explain what a salad was even though we had salads on the table with our popadoms. Throughout the meal we were constantly rushed, plates were taken before we were finished I was pushed into the table so many times by waiters I thought this must be a joke? It was hot, cramped and noisy (not in a fun jolly kind of way). Maybe its just me but when I go out to eat its for the whole experience not just the food (although the food IS the most important thing for me don't get me wrong). I just like it to be effortless and stress free...",

We thought we'd give it a try. Didn't know you could bring in your own alcohol, so we just stuck to water, but that would be another plus for me. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the Dhal Gosht Karahi and my husband had Chicken Keema Karahi. Both were served quickly; we each ordered the small portions, but were satisfied with the meal and left full and happy. We typically enjoy spicier foods, and if I could order the same item again, I would have asked for a mute intense heat. But the flavors were fresh and delicious nevertheless.

    "text": "Few restaurants so cheap they can boast such popularity that people will queue for over an hour to get a table. Not that you could ever persuade yourself that you're waiting for a table at an exclusive new haunt. The interior and casual dress of the diners ensure this is nothing more than a cheap and cheerful eat. The best curry places are rarely glitzy \u00a0and certainly not in London where you can find an infinite number of authentic international restaurants. Those who consider their surroundings more important than what's on their plate would do well to aim for a bland Mayfair restaurant. If you've made the journey from Aldgate East or Whitechapel station down this back road (which you would never walk down by accident) then you either know what you're coming for or someone in your party does. If you have the foresight to book, and I strongly urge that you do \u00a0it's the equivalent of a queue jump, then the wait isn't too unbearable and you get to enjoy watching less organised, impatient, hungry people as they form a queue that crawls round the restaurant. The service is not amazing. But that's also not why you would come here. You are served promptly, which is marvellous if you don't wish to wait 45 minutes for your food. And when it comes it's worth it. The menu is limited and it has every right to be. They know what they do well and I would struggle to order anything other than the lamb karahi as I know I will be more than satisfied. That said, I've never had a bad meal here and have yet to find another curry in London more tasty. Given the option of an Indian (and being able to book) I would plump for Tayyabs every time. There are two types of people in this world: those who love Tayabbs and those who don't know about it. Just don't forget to bring your own beer (Tiger or Cobra, obviously) as it's unlicensed.",

The roti's were the same.Now all this would still make a restaurant lack well but their service is quite horrible. We had a reservation for 9.30 pm last night and upon arrival our name was checked in to their computer and we were 5-10 minutes. We could see how busy they were so we waited patiently for 15 minutes before I asked him again and they said \"you have cancelled your reservation\". This was rather strange as we had already been told by the same guy yes I have your reservation and we will seat you soon. The manager then finds us and says, your table is ready at which point I narrate this incident to him which he just shrugs off!During the meal one of our grill dishes never showed up. So we pointed this out to them and both the server and the manager proceed to question about how this could be true as the kitchen said they sent it. Are we sure we did not eat it. Now, which self respecting restaurant would question their customer, especially when the dish in question was \u00a32.70!I for one will not be going back to this place and I would suggest if you want service and great Indian Grills head on over to Sitaaray on Drury Lane.",

We waited for over 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order. Sauces and poppadoms were placed on our table without us ordering it. We ordered lamb gosht (spicy and decent), daal (bland), chicken biryani (flavorful and delicious), bhindi 'okra' (delicious) and plain naan (oily but tasty). We were underwhelmed by the serving size of the dishes and the quality. They were really busy at 4 pm on Sunday so maybe they were having an off day. Bottles of still water were placed on the table for \u00a32.50 each. We asked for tap water but our waiter said it's only served upstairs; it's strange that it's only served in a part of the restaurant even though it's the law. On the bill, they charged us for the poppadoms, which we didn't order or weren't asked if we wanted them. We addressed our concerns with the waiter and he wouldn't budge until the manager stepped in. The waiter said we ordered it so we asked him to show us what he wrote down and he refused to show it. Eventually, they removed the poppadoms.",

Mediocre vegetarian choice. Only paneer dish was starter, not sizzling but fairly nice.- Amazing sauces though. Minty sauce was kind of spicy, unusual but delicious.- Finally, don't go in your best clothes - will just come out smelling of onion and meaty sizzlers!",

    "text": "I came here with a friend based on the various rave reviews including its number one spot on a London curry house chart.Quite easy to get to via the 'ammersmif n city line, the restaurant manages to be enormous and claustrophobic at the same time: it is on three sprawling levels yet the tables are crammed in \u00e0 la Ryan Air. But don't let the large space fool you into thinking that seating will be a quick affair. We had a reservation and it is a good thing that we did because there was a line of people out of the door and inside, weaving around some of the tables. Fortunately we were not seated at any of those tables because that would have been rather annoying. Instead, we went downstairs into the bowels of Tayyabs where we were wedged in between two couples or maybe we were all at the same table - it was all that tight.We had the lamb chops to start with. This was a big mistake because the couple next to us had some kind of mixed grill thing, which had lamb chops AND other stuff. Fortunately, the lamb chops were delicious but I really wanted the other stuff too... I had the dried meat, which was awesome if unappetizing sounding and my friend had the lamb karahi. We also split a karahi bhindi, which was great. The rice was just OK but the naan bread was excellent. All in all, it was a good thing that we didn't get the couple next door's appetizer because despite arriving ravenous, we left stuffed and our desire for spice fully sated.",

That is when I realised this was not a restaurant but a manufacture. This place is soooo big! And who say big, says loud. Really loud! No matter how good the food can be, I do not understand what can be attracting in eating food without being able to have a conversation with your friends.

And there we went The Boxing Day for dinner. We found a seat downstairs in a \u00a0relatively more empty setting than we anticipated.Our food was just as \u00a0I wanted it to be. Service was simply terrible.The guests next to our table came after us, but they were already served first dish even before the server took our order. But we said nothing.By close to our meal we realized we were not given a Garlic Naan. which was fine as we were full already. so we told the server not to bother about the Naan and asked for the bill.Our bill had an entry for Garlic Naan. No big deal, we asked our server to correct it as we already had told him about it before asking for the bill.Then the conversation went something like this:Server: But i did not charge for water.Us: The water was same one you serve to every table. The menu says nothing that water is not served without request (coming from \u00a0LA we know)Server: The water was mineral water. It costs 2.5 pounds on the menuUs: The bottle clearly says still water. It taste like tap water too.Server: And I did not charge for papadams either. For those of us not of South Asian heritage, you never charge for it unless it is asked as a menu item. Sure enough menu had no entry for it.At this point we asked to see somebody senior.in comes another man who parrots the lie that water was mineral even he admits we did not order it. i then ask him to ask any other guest drink water from identical bottles.He refuses, changes to a native tongue that i fully understand and asks haughtily \"what are you going to do, eh?\" I will give him benefit of the doubt and say he did not mutter an expletive in the next breath.Disgusted, and in presence of my son and wife, I walk out..here is what i am going to do1. write this review 2. Canceled another dinner with LA based friends over New Year3. Do everything i can to spread the news that food is not worth the rudeness and simply bad business practices.",

In the States, normal folks don't come out to Pakistani/Indian food but it was definitely a nice surprise to see how much the English love desi food. I first came here on a Tuesday afternoon which was quiet dead so we got our food quick and were in and out. We had ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Karahi, Lamb Chops, and Naan...holy crap was it good!We tried coming back about 10 days later on a Saturday night and the line was out the door, about 30 people deep so we went to Lahore Kebab House instead. The next day we came and got the tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, lamb chops, goat karahi, biryani, and kulfi. I would low key pass on the biryani cause they got some weird raisins in it and it seemed just not traditional in both Pakistani and Indian dishes. The service is really great, throw some Urdu in and they will love you. We need this quality of food in the U.S ASAP!",

When I moved to Chicago, I got my first taste of authentic Indian spices and fell in love. I was shocked to hear when I booked our honeymoon to London that some of the best Indian food was here. I was prepared for that whole fish and chips vibe, not Punjabi.We stayed near the Aldgate station area so this place was conveniently located to our hotel, plus it had some of the best reviews in the entire city. Also, when we arrived it had almost no tourists (aside from us) which is always a huge selling point for me. First piece of advice, grab a reservation. I was lucky and found something but just barely. Even with reservations we still waited for 15 minutes. We had the Karahi and Spinach Paneer with a billion orders of Naan. It's difficult to mess up Naan, but this was some of the best I've had. Also, whatever yogurt dip they brought, please bottle this and ship it to the U.S. so I can eat it on everything. I had my eyes on the dry meat but the portions were huge and we couldn't handle more. The table next to us ordered some kind of meat dish that practically covered their table and I feel like I could have gotten down with that if I hadn't filled my mouth with endless Naan. These were like, body building men three times the size of me though.",

I'm just disappointed in the service because it took us at least an hour to get our food! After about 30 minutes of waiting, we tried to flag down a couple of waiters to see where our food was at but they would just glance and walk past us. Finally one guy was nice enough to stop (although disgruntled that he had to); we advised him we were still waiting on the lamb and he responded very confused saying \"there are no orders for this table.\" WHAT?! By the time we finally got our last dish it was like 10 pm and we've been starving since 8. Also some warning, the restaurant doesn't have a good vent system and everyone's ordering the grilled lamb, so expect to walk out smelling like a BBQ.",

    "text": "What an adventure!Okay, here's the deal. This is the place to hit for amazing kebabs and grilled meat. Interestingly, these are all items you will find in their appetizer section. The actual entrees are your typical Bengladeshi/Pakistani/India fare, but not particularly memorable. Stick to the grilled stuff and you will be very pleased and the naan are fresh. The seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, and lamb chops were all great!So, the food really hits the spot and there's no argument there. The prices are also very reasonable for London. As for the service/seating experience, that's where it hurts. You can make reservations online through their website. However, if you arrive on a weekend night like we did, you will be greeted by an unhappy mob of people overflowing out the entry room of the restaurant into the street. There is one guy from the restaurant running around trying to get people to form into a serpentine line and manage the flow. When you inform him about your reservation, he will simply say, \"Online reservation, no reservation. Only phone reservation.\" When you show him your confirmation of the reservation, he basically will tell you a bunch of rude stuff that doesn't make any sense and tell you to get in line with all the people who don't have a reservation. As you may have noted from other reviews, they basically don't honor reservations. I got the idea that there was a mild chance they might honor a phone reservation, though even that was somewhat doubtful. From all appearances, the wait even at off times on a weekend evening could run into the 1-2 hour range. When we arrived, it was definitely around two hours wait. We saw many other people arrive and have the exact same issue. This restaurant basically lures people in with seemingly available reservations and then blindsides them with a huge 2 hour wait on arrival. They had no apologies and seemed to imply that everyone who made a reservation had done something wrong.Part of the popularity is that they don't serve alcohol, but they allow you to bring your own. Given the cost savings, it is a hugely popular destination among the drinking crowd. This is what we gathered while we waited. We had little children in our party, it was already 9:30pm when we arrived, everyone was starving, we had cabbed all the way across from the other side of London only because of this reservation and not wanting to wait at something closer, and this bait and switch with the reservation was not something we were going to let slide. After intermittently hassling the front man for about 45 minutes, he somehow squeezed us into a small table downstairs and allowed us to skip out on what appeared to be at least another 60-90 minute wait otherwise. End note: Grilled food is solid if you can get in there somehow. Just be prepared for 3rd world shenanigans! Again, for a 30 minute wait or if they actually honor your reservation, probably worth it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.",

    "text": "If I were forced to name only one (a terrifyingly difficult challenge for a food lover like me) favorite food establishment in the whole wide world, it would have to be Tayyabs. It took me a while to believe all the fabulous comments regarding Tayyabs having been loyal for so long to Lahore Kabab House, perhaps a mile away. But finally I did and from the first time I ate here I knew I would want this to be my last meal on earth. I do not exaggerate my friends. I can be quite demanding and merciless in my comments. So please take me seriously.My problem with Tayyabs is that everything on the menu is so good and I have only one stomach and so many dishes to choose from. So I always over order. The beef kababs are to die for. Then the karahi daal (most of the dishes come in karahis) the chana masala, the saag or palak aloo, I could go on to mention everything on the menu. When accompanied by my wife, we also order aloo gobi, chicken boti, karahi lamb and lamb chops and sometimes I order the huge tandoori prawns, (I may be using my own names for some of the dishes) -- all scooped with with delicious naans and washed down with a jug (yes I mean a jug for all that much food) of mango lassi. Go for the kheer but save some room (or more appropriately create some) for the blissful mishti doi at Ambala, nearby on Whitechapel Road.I spend so much of my precious London (another of my favorite cities) time trekking back and forth from the West End to Whitechapel but believe me it is worth it. For me a journey all the way from the US to London to partake in the devine food at Tayyabs is also well worth the cost and the time.---------------------------------------------As an update, my wife and I went to Tayyabs on Christmas Day in 2017 (yes it was open, even though with the public transportation system in London closed that day and we had to find a cab there and back on a day when, understandably few cab drivers were working). The kababs did not taste like on previous visits although the daal, chana and saag were just as good. My wife only ate some of her kadai chicken and complained that it was not as good as in the past. So I am lowering the rating to 4 stars though would still like the daal here as my last meal.I have heard mention (and not having been there yet cannot confirm) that the previous chef from Tayyabs now has his own restaurant, Needos around the corner.",

The naan was freshly made and has the perfect amount of pull to it, the rice was hot and the curry was delicious. The lamb in the curry was as soft as you're going to find and the chicken in the other was moist, although I did enjoy the lamb and potato one more hahaThe service was friendly, we got our food fairly quickly and it's BYOB so the alcohol prices aren't a problemOverall, if you get the chance, visit Tayyabs, you won't be disappointed!!",

The spicy one is SO good. My husband and I have a problem with heat-addiction, so we finished that one. It's pretty hot, actually. Looking around at all the other tables, most had hardly touched the spicy one. The bbq lamb appetizer was incredible. It came out steaming hot and we ate that up in one minute.The lentils and chicken dish I had were also great. My husband ordered a shrimp dish which neither of us could eat. That is saying a lot, as shrimp is both of our faves. Do not order seafood here. I guess we should have known.The service was super short and unfriendly. But the prices are very reasonable.",

The food is faultlessly spiced; some say it's a little hot. Well, real Indian food is. But like all real food, you can see the spices as well as taste them. No mucky generic sauce blankets the dishes here. Everything is served piping hot and riddled with distinct cooked in flavours, whole spices and real taste. To start I'd recommend the Sheek Kebab (comes with salad) and a naan - when these arrive, tear the naan, fill with salad, a kebab and yoghurt sauce and tuck in . . . . it's a delicious starter. The Samosas here are also great. Keep an eye out for the daily specials on the menu - my favourite is the Tinda Masaala, a gourd not unlike a round courgette cooked with lots of fresh ginger, green chilly and spices. Don't go overboard on the rice and naan thing that so many people seem obsessed with, you won't have room for the real food. Have one, or the other, not both. You won't find a single dud in the dishes served here - the owners (and the clientele) just would not stand for second rate food. To drink, I'd recommend the Mango Lassi. It's sweetness soothes the heat of some of the dishes superbly. Booze is not available here, but you can bring your own subject to a modest corkage charge. This is real Punjabi food as it is eaten in North India and Pakistan. Eat at Tayyab's and challenge your pre-conceptions. You might realise that the so-called Indian food served in Brick Lane (with one - just one - exception) bears no relationship to real Indian and Pakistani food. Oh - and you always come away from here thinking 'It can't have been that cheap, can it?'.",

The tandoor starter got us off to a screaming start. And then, mouths atingling, tastebuds ajumping, the mains dazzled us senseless. Everyone should add their dry meat to one of the things you have to do in London before you die or leave. I proclaimed mid-meal that it was a gazillion times better than the michelin starred Indian place I'd been to in Mayfair a couple of months ago. When the bill arrived (a mere \u00a380 for six adults - one of them pregnant - all of us eating for two) I loved that it was one gazillionth of the price too. Eat that!",

I can highly recommend the seekh kebabs which are less than \u00a31 and have a great kick to them. The samosa's are also good value for money. An excellent range of starters and mains makes it an ideal place for large groups which allows you to try lots of the dishes in one sitting. The chicken keema dish is particularly good with their freshly made naan. Goodness I'm just salivating at the thought of it! The mango lassi is huge - definitely couldn't finish it myself, and the bring your own policy is a good way of ensuring you pay less than a tenner.",

I am by no means an expert on this kind of cuisine, so all I can say is that the emphasis is squarely on taste, rather than blasting you with spice, and that the menu is one of those where you feel encouraged to venture beyond your own comfort zone. I like this place for the following reasons: BYO - it's a rarity these days, and thus feels like a bit of treat. You get these little glasses to drink your grog out of, which make you feel like you're at a speakeasy. Credibility - it feels like a local restaurant, rather than a tourist experience (Brick Lane) or a recreation of the 'great days of our colonial empire' (your average high st curry house). Atmosphere - it's always buzzing.",

Since the restaurant doubled in size and became snazzy, the number of clientele seems to have tripled in tandem. The word of mouth is extraordinary on this place. Book ahead if you can, or expect to queue for a while, but the wait is worth it. Even though the business has changed over the years, it still retains a fun, jostling mood. The food, oh the food. Delicious tender chunks of Hallal meat, covered in strong but balanced spices and flavours. I think we have tried every dish on offer and they are all incredible. The only down side is that the waiters ship you in and out as quickly as possible, which can be annoying. But who cares with food this good?",

I said yes and later found out that you are charged for Popadoms. It's an insignificant charge compared to the rest of the meal, but I'm not a fan of venues which are miserly.For dinner, I ordered Karahi Mutton Tikka Masala (for those unfamilar with Indian and Pakistani food, it is basically lamb chunks served in a skillet bowl with spices and a few veggies) with a Tandoori Naan. The Mutton and the Naan were delicious. Tayyabs also offered three sauces: white yogurt based, spice based, and sweet based; each was tasteful in its own way and added an element of versatility to the meal.",

The food - especially the lamb chops - is still incredibly delicious, and there are still long lines out the door, but I've taken away a star as I think the service has gone downhill. Yes, no one ever went to Tayyabs for service and ambience (let's face it, it's the Indian restaurant equivalent of the sadly lamented Wong Kei), but, still, there are certain standards, such as offering tap water - not charging for it - and trying not to injure your customers. On the latter, try your very best to gauge the direction from which the food will be served, and sit away from there. On a recent visit, I had sizzling bowls of food thrust right past my ear onto the table, causing me to jump in the process. There wasn't even a \"careful, hot!\" warning which came with it. I finally managed to save myself by piling up bowls and cutlery on my side of the table so that there was no more available space. That's right - I threw another friend at the table under the bus in order to save myself. So what? I will say one thing about the waitstaff though. They have incredible memories. Our waiter took our order (a table of six) without writing anything down and headed off to the next table (a table of ten) and took their orders before going to the kitchen. Nothing went awry with our orders, and, I believe, the other table got all of their food as well. It was a pretty amazing feat.",

You could be going to a shadier looking place and pay the same (depending on the dishes). Waiters were nice, but service was slow and inattentive even though we were RIGHT NEXT TO the kitchen. The servers bring out parathas and dips/chutneys once you're seated. Fantastic!Mixed grill - not on the menu, but they'll offer a variety of the tikkas-- lamb, chicken, \u00a0shish kebob, etc. All of the grills were very delicious, and it all comes in a giant pile of greasy, oily meat. The shish kebob and the chicken were my favorite, but they really overcooked the lamb. Good flavoring... bad presentation and method. Chicken tikka masala - this is my favorite dish in any south asian restaurant (yeah yeah it's not \"authentic\" but that doesn't mean it's not crazy delicious!). There wasn't much curry. Flavoring was good but it left much to be desired. I'm stuffed but still want a curry... \u00a0(from somewhere else)Daal - Lentils and aubergine. Eh. Didn't care for it to be honest. It was rather dry.Naan - Best part of the meal honestly. Soft, fluffy naan. I tried the plain, garlic, and paretha (?). The garlic one tasted like nothing. It just plain naan with some coriander sprinkled over it. The peshwari naan must've had crack. It was DELICIOUS. Tasted more like dessert (fruit and coconut-y in the inside). Nothing crazy fancy but the naan was fantastic. My biggest issue was how greasy it all was. The naan was dripping with (and had piles of) butter and oil. Yikes. I get that you're supposed to brush the naan with the butter but I don't want my bread with pools of grease, thanks.Mango lasso - YUM! Smooth, creamy, delicious. I wish it had more mango (and less yogurt) but it was fantastic and I had three glasses. Whoops. Order a pitcher if more than a handful of your table wants mango lassi.I really liked the place overall, but I'll probably head elsewhere for my curry cravings next time.",

They also take reservations online - definitely recommend you make one.Service was a little slow (according to our friend who took us there), and they mixed up one of our orders by giving our starters to the wrong table. Aside from the mixups and having to wait, the food was really good and a decent price. The lamb chops are fabulous, as are the king prawns. Ended the massive meal by splitting a mango lassi and then walked home in a food coma.",

I ordered the karahi gosthe and my brother ordered the kababs. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. The samosas were a good size and equally flavorful. Also ordered the mango lassi because it has such a unique flavor! The service: Beyond excellent. My phone ran out of batteries and I needed an outlet to plug it in. Not only did the staff found me an outlet, they guarded the phone, trouble shot issues when it wasn't charging and made sure I got my Uber. The best type of people. We loved this place so much we went to dinner twice in five days. The only tip I would give new visitors is to take an Uber rather then the train. The location of the restaurant is a bit out of the way.",

The app customer chat service doesn't work and if you order through them be prepared to not get your order waste at least 30 minutes of your time.

I could really see why the lamb chops were famous. They were good even though I got takeaway. The prices were pretty reasonable as there was enough for me to eat two meals. They were extremely busy, and took a while to prepare my order, but that's okay. Great spot for lamb!",

We were originally heading to bricklane, but this one caught our eye on yelp, it looked and sounded different from your standard Indian restaurant in east London. We were rushed to our table in the basement, packed in like sardines, everything about this place was built for a fast in and out experience, we were shocked at how busy this place was, we honestly thought we were about to experience something special. The food was pretty standard, lacked spice and major key flavours, the naan was greasy, and again lacked any flavour at all. We also hadn't realised that it was a BYOB restaurant, so getting up to go to a corner store within the first 5mins of the meal was a great thrill.Thankfully the end of the meal came, but not before we had to down the beers we had purchased because they rushed the food from table our so quickly. We then had to queue to pay along with all the other people waiting for a table (not totally sure why). Not a terribly great experience, my advice would be to find a smaller more hospitable traditional atmosphere.",

The lamb chops and sheekh kebabs were my fave! The biryani meat to rice ratio was annoying. There was too much meat and not enough rice and the portion was tiny. Then they also brought out biryani sauce with additional meat. That was great but had there been more rice we could have added the sauce, which essentially was like another curry. Rice is so cheap so I'm not sure why they were stingy with it. Mango lassi was delicious, kheema samosa perfect. Chicken karahi was more one a chicken tikka masala but still okay.

After reading that it was best to make a reservation, my friend booked the night before. \u00a0We arrived approximately 45minutes before our reservation time and the lobby was PACKED. \u00a0It was hectic and chaotic. \u00a0I know this place gets busy so we already leveled our expectations prior to coming here. \u00a0However, there was no clear line in the lobby - we couldn't figure out which queue was for walk-ins or which area was for reservations. \u00a0We tried to ask a host multiple times where and how we check in if we already made a reservation. \u00a0He pointed us to stand in line with everyone else. I understand this is a busy restaurant but customer service was extremely lacking. \u00a0The lines were not efficient. All this waiting gave me time to people-watch...Cleanliness was a huge thumbs-down. \u00a0The tables weren't properly wiped down - there were still food crumbs on the tables before the waiters would hide it under the paper place mats. I saw a waiter use the same hand he was cleaning the table to deliver a stack of naans - placing his thumb on top of the naans to hold them down during transfer. \u00a0That was gross!! Now the food: \u00a0Complimentary salad and appetizers were appreciated. \u00a0The food was good but not outstanding. We had a chicken and dried meat dish with rice, roti, and naan to share between two people and it was plenty! Their meat dishes were on the slightly salty side but that's just for me. \u00a0My friend thoroughly enjoyed the flavors. \u00a0I dream about their garlic naan to this day. \u00a0They charge for the bottled water FYI. \u00a0Overall, this place was not for me because of the terrible customer service. \u00a0Maybe if I had went when it wasn't so busy, the experience would've been different. \u00a0But for now, I don't think I'd recommend this spot.",

It was really easy to book a table and they had no problem accommodating a large group as it's what the place is set up for. The BYOB aspect was very good as we had a mix of drinkers and non-drinkers and it makes splitting the bill much fairer. With a table that big the staff were helpful in suggesting how many rice and bread we should get and were patient while everyone made their choices but otherwise just let us get on with the evening. I think this restaurant is better for meat eaters. There wasn't a great selection for veggies but the food I had was nice enough and reasonably priced. Pretty easy to get to but a little tucked away. I'd say its great for groups although be prepared to be sharing the entire restaurant with other big groups and lots of noise.",

I have had much better in Harrow, Southall, and most areas with a sizable Asian population. The service was atrocious. Firstly they made us wait for 45 minutes despite having a reservation. It was a Friday, so it was busy, but what is the point of reservations if they cannot stick to them? The food was slow to come, and did not come at the right time. Ordering an extra coke, for example took about 20 minutes. The food was very average, and not much choice.",

It's all about bringing your own...which is a fantastic idea and cuts out the middle man who whacks on 50%!Go enjoy this slice of India just off of Whitechapel and it wont disappoint.

I forgot that it was BYOB and had to go to the local Tesco for some wine. By the time I got back my two ladies had been moved to another table because they had not ordered. Apparently, since we had a reservation, we were first seated at a more desirable table. When we failed to order quickly enough we were demoted to the very busy and bustling front of house where the tables are shared. I wasn't too bothered by that but I was bothered by my thanking the waiter without getting so much as a look or a smile as we left. It was almost like we had pissed them off by coming to dinner there. Too bad because the food is very good and very interesting. The dry meat curry particularly so. I'm not sure I would return given that I only get to try London Indian food so rarely. Even though the prices are three to four times what Tayyabs charge, I would still rate Amma in New York and Noor Jahan in London as the best Indian food I have eaten.",

Traditional Punjabi mains of dry-meat curries served in a karahi (small wok) receive praise too, & rather than rice, opt for a buttery naan or big freshly made roti from the open kitchen. The big portions are 'cheap as chips' & 'always hit the spot' & costs are further cut by the BYO policy.

Then when we sat down to eat, the waiter forgot one of our orders and we then we didnt want to stay long because we could see the queues were so long and we felt like after we finished eating we should leave quickly out of consideration of the people queuing. every time ive been to tayyabs i have found that a problem. the food is decent but not worth waiting 45mins in the cold for.",

I'd been told of this place back in the day when I called East London my home (a distant 5 months ago), but, deterred by the tales of queues out the door, I hadn't made the journey. Thanks to my good friends persuading (well not much persuading at all) we ended up there last Friday night, 6:30, prime rush hour. Yes, there was an enormous line, but it moved surprisingly fast. I actually enjoyed the wait, as the aromas that fly past you are a fantastic appetizer for what's to come. As it's a dry restaurant, my friend popped out to grab some wine, while I watched sizzling racks of lamb and chicken kebabs criss cross in front of me. I busied myself by reading some of the reviews on the wall (apparently Zagat rated it #10 resto in all of London, scoring only one point less than Gordon Ramsay's). And apparently the usual range of celebs (Britney, heads of state etc.) have stopped in. This restaurant is a highly efficient operation (which I always observe in great detail, having worked the hospitality industry. These guys know how to run this ship). Veggies and dips on the table literally as we sat down, a waiter at our side within 2 mins...my friend's napkin replaced *before it even hit the floor*. Seriously. They are all over you. Very fast, very hustle/bustle but in a good way. Now...the FOOD. OMG. (must stop saying that). But it was OMG. Could they pack any more flavour into these dishes?? My friend (who's Pakistani, I was told to go with a pro) did all the ordering, so I can't me more specific to the dishes other than to say, pretty much anything you order will be absolutely amazing. Fall off the bone chicken, beautiful curries, incredible. I hadn't done Pakistani food and found it to be a mix between Indian (for the spice factor), and Persian (one dish in particular, name fails me). The price factor is also pretty omg (small caps omg, as this is London after all, but relatively speaking, very very affordable) As soon as we finished I wanted to do it all over again. Because it's so busy, it's not a place to linger over your byob, so get in, get out and get back in line!!!",

I'm here for some lunch, not a three-day feast. Staff also get annoyed when you send back the papadam - i guess because they have just earned 60p less (for those who do not know, they charge you for the papadam they automatically bring to your table). One waiter flew into a badly masked rage when, after ordering a mango lassie and not recieving it with the meal, we insisted that it be taken off the bill (he wanted us to have the lassie even though we had finished our meal and were paying). He was furious and let's not forget that a lassie costs 2 quid, you would have thought it was 200!! Great food but greedy, greedy, greedy staff. They should be happy that business is doing so well instead of getting in a twist about someone not wanting their 60p papadam. And oh, if you order take away it is advisable to check you have everything - I've had take away three times and each time they managed to forget something or give me something i had not ordered.",

You can have a nice meal here for \u00a310 which is typical for the Brick Lane area, not typical for central London generally. The service was not good in a conventional way, but they got the job done, and were very fast. It's a place to grab a quick bite, don't expect to hold your table unless you book the private dining room. As Tayyabs is not licensed you can bring your own and on the upside there is no corkage fee. To start I recommend the Seekh Kebabs, they come out sizzling on a hot plate with loads of gorgeous onions. For main course I got the Daal Tarka. It was nice but not as good as I'd had on Brick Lane before. Definately get the garlic Naan, its really tasty especially compared to the pilau rice which is only average.",

Now I know for a fact that outside the Indian Sub-continent and Pakistan the best Indian or Pakistani restaurants are in Dubai.Lived there 31 years and know it for a fact. Now in London, my relatives took me to Tayyab and I was quite happy with a good Pakistani Punjabi cuisine. Many people make a mistake and say it's the same, but they are not. The Pakistani and Indian cook in different manner. The day we went into Tayyab was crazy. The queue was so long and waited for an hour to get a table. But it was worth the wait.As soon as we got seated there were these spicy popadums with different chutneys. Had to lick the last chutney off my finger tips. Being a fan of lamb I tried the \"Gosh Dal\" - lamb cooked with lentils and i loved it. The \"karahi bindi ( okra or ladyfingers) were ok..not spectacular. The nan and rotis ( bread ) were great. My overall experience: A good place for Pakistani punjab cuisine. Please and i repeat please have the mango lassi ( mango buttermilk ) \u00a0like they say in London it's AWESOME....",

I would regard the food here as better than the fare you get in Brick Lane. The food is not particularly expensive and is pretty good. I wouldn't say the food was excellent but you will have a good meal here nonetheless. A speciality seems to be the lamb chops which everyone will tell you to order. They are arguably their best dish. I would also recommend the Korai. Whilst this place gets rave reviews, do not go here with too higher expectations as the food is not that amazing. It's good but has been overhyped in my opinion. If you don't like queuing then you wont like this place as even those that book end up having to queue. Very busy",

    "text": "Our supper club was 10 strong on Tuesday night when we arrived at Tayyabs around 7.30pm to find a queue of hungry punters stretching down the road. The lamb chops that I had been looking forward to sampling looked like they might have to wait for another occasion and talk turned to other establishments in the area that could possibly accommodate a large group at short notice. Fortunately we had the diminutive, but pretty scary, Priya in our party who marched to the head of the queue and had a quiet word with the staff in Hindi. Five minutes later we were all seated and cracking open the first of many Cobra beers. The restaurant itself is big, bustling and very vibrant. There are a couple of large rooms upstairs and another one in the basement. A wonderful, pungent aroma of meat and spices hits you as soon as you walk through the front door; great for getting the taste buds salivating but be warned that you will be making a trip to the dry cleaners the next day. After Priya's amazing success in getting us all in at the drop of a hat we decided that we would leave ourselves in her hands and let her order for the whole table. Popadoms and the usual accompaniments were first up; all very tasty but nothing to write home about. Things started to move up a gear with the arrival of plates laden with a section of nan breads which looked divine and tasted even better. To start with we had the mixed grill which is highly recommended. The succulent chicken tikka came sporting a lovely char, the sheekh kababs were full of flavour and the lamb chops took this meal to whole new level. I was beginning to understand why there was such a big queue of hungry punters happy to wait for an hour to get a taste of this delicious cooking. I'm struggling to remember everything that we had for the main courses but stand out dishes were the lamb chop curry, which was the special of the day, and the karhi keema. Despite our best efforts a couple of hours later we still had a mountain of food left which seemed a waste to leave uneaten; not a problem said our friendly waiter and few minutes later her returned with our food and nan bread beautifully package for us to take home. As Tayyabs is a bring your own booze place and charges no corkage fee the bill for this amazing Pakistani Punjabi feast came to an incredibly reasonable \u00a316 a head. A very small price to pay for what was one of my favourite meals this year. I have one final top tip which I picked up from my good friend Mr Sudra; if you give the restaurant a call the day or so before you wish to eat you may find that you are able to book a table in advance.",

Enter Tayyabs, which I came across back in 2009 when Charles L.'s rave review of this place.Granted it's a bit out of the way from Central London, but it is WELL worth it. Succulent flavorful lamb chops and tandoori chicken on sizzling platters with onions as well as their tandoori paneer made for excellent starters. Their okra and chickpea items were beyond anything I had ever had in the US, and their Tuesday quail special was particularly exquisite. My favorite though was their tikka masalas, and no, they aren't anything like the creamy, neutral-flavored dish that everyone has come to know in the US. No, their version here is much different, and much much BETTER. I ordered both their chicken and mutton tikka masalas and out came pieces of meat in a piquant chile laden sauce that had the perfect balance of spice and heat. Add hot from the tandoori naan and rice and a pitcher of perfectly sweetened, richly flavored mango lassi you get the best Indian meal I've ever had. Me and the fam managed to stuff our faces here not once but twice on our five day London excursion. Now I'm just sad that Indian food will never be this good stateside. *sigh*",

I taste these in my dreams, that's how great they were. The lamb chops are decadent, savory, spiced morsels that just melt in your mouth. The channa was the stuff of legends and the pappadums and mango chutney, there just didn't seem to ever be enough. The chicken tikka was absolute delish as well. Service is super fast and everyone there is so friendly. Since I've moved, I can't partake in the goodness as often as I want. Whenever I travel back to London I make sure to make a stop at Tayyab's.

Any concerns regarding the much maligned queuing system disappeared when the waiter told me that he would find me a table in 5 minutes, and proceeded to do so despite the long queue! Tayyabs, alongside Lahore Kebab House has long been championed as one of London's finest traditional curry houses but unlike Lahore (cheap-eat-london.com/200\u2026) , Tayyabs manages to deliver on all counts. Starters consist largely of meats off the grill and I can wholeheartedly recommend the plate of lamb chops (\u00a37 and is big enough for 2), curried koftas and chicken tikka whilst the mains saw the oddly named Dry Meat curry and chickpea dahl as the standout items although we were pleased with the prawns and chicken karahi as well. If you like the slow cooked texture of Beef Rendang then you should definitely go for the Dry Meat, whilst the chickpea dahl melts in the mouth before you can register the loving spoonful....Full review and high quality pictures at cheap-eat-london.com/201\u2026",

It was about 17:30 and the place was just about empty, so we had a good table by the window. I have to admit I am a bit of a hygiene freak when it comes to food preparation, here you will find the toilets not far from the food preparation area and a bit smelly. (there may be other toilets, but these were the ones I used). Staff were sampling the food behind the open buffet counter, I dread to think how many times the spoon was used between each bowl.When our popadoms were served they came on a small plate and were held in place by bare hands. I do hate other peoples fingers in my food. I can see why some reviewers have complained about the poor standard of these popadoms to me they were the prepacked ones you cook under the grill and there were a large quantity just stacked in front of the buffet serving area.The saving grace were the chops, as all previous reviewers have raved about, yes they are good, but that was as far as it goes. It is a small menu if you leave out the vegetarian section, and the portion size (unless you go for the large) is nothing to write home about.I think the price for the meal is a psychological thing, yes it seems reasonable, but considering you bring your own drinks with you, if you add the price of a couple of bottles of kingfisher at restaurant prices and have the large meals, the bill is about on par.Having said all that we were not disapppointed. I like a restaurant where you take your own drinks and there is no cork charge. Take screw tops just in case, and your own wine glasses. We left about 19:20 as queues were srarting to form and we felt a bit guilty.",

Once in, order hot,buttery,fluffy naans, anything from the sizzling grill (Tandoori chicken and lamb chops are a must for carnivores), daal begum (spicy mini aubergines and daal) and spicy keema are the highlights.

Having heard about this place after its write up in 'The Metro' and recommendations from friends I decided to head there with 6 people one Sun evening. It's a little walk from Aldgate East tube and Whitechapel and down a few streets..get a map out!I'd pre booked after being told to do so by my friend who'd been before and expected to wait a bit but wasn't prepared for the chaos that ensued.The bad points were as follows1) Pre booked and still had to wait 30min to be seated after talking to nearly every staff member in there2)The staff's faces as they all look like they've lost the will to live from the chaos in this place, they couldn't care whether you stay or go so don't think about complaining as there are 100 more people who will willingly take your place in the queue to get a seat- yes you still have to queue to get a seat after you've booked3)People everywhere, queues over-spilling in the restaurant4)The look of anger from your friends as they secretly want to kill you for bringing them to this madness and making them wait for 30min till you get a table5)Being seated like cattle6) Rushed atmosphere to finish food- maybe this is a good thing?Now the positives- there are some honest1)Bring Your Own Booze- nice touch2)The cattle seating and chaos actually becomes quite atmospheric and adds to the charm of this place3)Very cheap food4)The look of satisfaction from said party when they realise this is pretty damn good food5) Probably the best curry I've ever tasted and being half indian I've tasted a fewDefinitely go for the dry meat or lamb chops, they got thumbs up from all of us, I also really liked the saag aloo The food here is perfect and was definitely worth the wait but be prepared for the stress if you go at peak times. Not recommended if you're easily stressed or impatient.Also if it's late evening be a bit weary as someone was stabbed outside the restaurant as we were waiting to pay our billAll together a perfect night and will definitely be going back!",

Not only is it good, but it really wasn't that pricey at all, which is hard to find sometimes.

Make a reservation unless you want to join the queues which can stretch to many dozens of people. I didn't try the much-adored lamb chops, instead having some Karahi dhal gosht and focusing on veg dishes: bindi and a pumpkin curry. All were really well-flavoured. My wife and I were stuffed full on the above, rice, roti and some paneer - and we had to take some home, we couldn't finish it all - for just \u00a325.

    "text": "pop by for some photos:hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  Tayyabs is a real London institution as it is the case for few other cheap ethnic haunts. Not far from Whitechapel Tube Station, this inconspicouus restaurant is tucked away in a little backstreet. That said, Tayyabs would be inconspicuous, if it wasn't for the hordes of people patiently waiting in front for their share of Punjabi Pakistani food. Tayyabs was founded more than 30 years ago and has been growing from a local cafe to one of the places you have to visit in London before you die (or before you leave, which some people might argue is the same). It does not have an alcohol license and what adds to its incredible value is there is no corkage charge for bringing a bottle or two. Finally it was my time to pay Tayyabs a visit. When you are disorganised enough to go on a Saturday evening like yours truly, be prepared to queue at least 30 minutes. Even though the turnover is high, there are a lot of people queuing too As soon as we were seated we got served poppadoms with raw cucumber, onion and tomato and a selection of very tasty chutneys (mango, rajita and a tomato chili one), and this for free! I The menu is small and easily fits on one double-page \u00a0there is selection of tandoori dishes, some meat and fish curries and some vegetable dishes. Apparently the lamb chops (6) are a must at Tayyabs. They came sizzling hot (a portion consists of 4 chops) and full of wonderful flavours from the tandoori grill, unfortunately they were borderline to completely overdone. While I was not fully convinced about the reason for Tayyabs cult status after these chops, I was fully taken by the wonderful garlic naan (2) which was light, soft and fluffy with just the right amount of garlic. I thought the Karahi Chicken (6.50), tender chicken immersed in a rich tomato based spicy sauce, was merely nice. The Karahi Mixed Vegetables (5.20) however, were among the most delicious curries I have ever tasted. Vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, peppers, aubergine and potatoes were cooked far beyond al dente in a flavourful gravy of Indian spices. Yes it was greasy but I loved even the grease on this rare occasion.lamb chops (6)garlic naan (2)Karahi Chicken (6.50)Karahi Mixed Vegetables (5.20) The atmosphere is reminiscent of a canteen but well, so are the prices, one can't complain really! The value for money ratio at Tayyabs is hard to beat. I didn't have Indian food this tasty for that ridiculously small amount of money anywhere else in London. I don't say it doesn't exist, just that I haven't found it yet. Open for suggestion though!",

    "text": "After being told that my phony British accent was nothing more than an American speaking slowly, my friend and I wandered the streets of Whitechapel, or what my friend and I refered to as I(ndia)-town, \u00a0in search of something tasty to satisfy my phony british tongue. I'll admit it, east London is dodgey and scared me silly but I've heard that Indian food is better in London than in India. I doubt that can be true but Tayyabs makes it easier to believe. My friend and I wandered the streets and peered into a few establishments, nothing caught our attention. We were tired and hungry, so we decided to stop at the next decent Indian place which happened to be Tayyabs. We showed up at an odd hour and the place was empty. We sat down as if we had the life sucked out of us and ordered some usual items. When the food came out, we both forgot that there were utensils in front of us and did not breathe until we had finished inhaling our food and anything that seemed edible on our plates.. Yes it was THAT good. Good thing no one else was there so there were no one there to witness our uncouth behavior.Fat, happy and amazed; we returned to our friend's flat. Later on in the week, we asked our buddy to take us to an Indian restaurant that would convince us that Indian food in London is better than Indian food in India. He said okay and where did we end up? Tayyabs! [Yes at this point I felt as if I was a local] Although the experience this time was completely different. It was the same great food but since it was dinner time on a friday night the service was rushed. We ended up waiting a full hour until they sat the 5 of us at a table. We all ate merrily and were chatting away when the waiter came by and started taking out plates away. A few that were not finished eating looked at each other. As the waiter was reaching for my friend's plate he was compelled to ask [in his un-phony British accent] the waiter \"Excuse me sir, are you short of plates? We are not finished eating\" It was clear that he was still eating and the waiter replied \"Yes, Youuuuu are not finished but shhheee is\" and took my plate away. Now this warrented evil-burning-the-back-of-your-head-crazy-eyed-stares from all of us at the table. Another waiter came by and asked if there was a problem and my friend explained what happened. The waiter told us to take our time... We finished eating and when the bill cameout, we were tempted to leave a bad tip.. but in the end we decided that maybe they were short of plates and left a decent tip. Hopefully they spend it wisely.",

Totally chaotic and urgent (queues of drooling punters practically snaking down the street), this is all about the lamb and the mutton. The dishes are beautifully spiced and flavoured, practically dancing on your plate with complex, hypnotic aromas and perfectly balanced spiciness. The service is abysmal - they rush you to finish so they can replace you with new diners - but not unfriendly, and diners sit elbow-to-elbow, cramped liked anchovies in a jar. You also come out smelling of oil and chilli, and all your clothes will need washing. Still, a classic, absurdly cheap, and one of London's great experiences.",

That's the length of Jurassic Park III right there! We were shoved downstairs next to a stag party in an area that resembled a nightclub, where let's just say the service was distracted.

    "text": "As you draw nearer Tayyabs you'll notice the queue of locals and city boys loitering optimistically outside, trying to edge their way closer for a table. Queue's are always a good sign outside any restaurant but this one is actually quite fundamental to the whole Tayyabs experience. Even if you manage to book (which will require at least two weeks advanced preparation for weekends) you'll still have to wait at least 15 minutes until the waiter manages to turn your table. Therefore my advice is to go at least half an hour before you think you'll want to eat. That way you can take full advantage of their BYOB policy, have a couple of cans of beer (they don't allow glass in the queue) and scour the menu. By the time you manage to get a seat your taste buds are already warmed up and you are ready to order. \u00a0  \u00a0Please don't let this warning put you off, I'm only trying to prepare you so as you don't run away when you're warned it'll be a 45 minute wait for a table. Tayyabas is well worth it. It is my favourite Indian restaurant in the whole of London. Their Tandori Lamb Chops are smokey, spicy, sweet and delicious, the kind of taste you could only hope to recreate at home. Their curries are phenomenal too- I'd recommend the Sag and the Bindi which are both packed with fresh vegetables. A small curry is more than enough and that way you can order starters and side dishes guilt free. Last time I went the bill for four of us was \u00a345 and we ordered poppadoms, starters, curries, nann, rice- the works! I would recommend Tayyabs to anyone who likes a bit of buzz about their restaurants and doesn't mind waiting for a great meal",

Perfect set up, honestly this place is a must and it is the first really true food monument of London I have tried, and it was a success. Go for it all the way.",

    "text": "I have to say I like Tayyabs, but I don't get the hype. Great Pakistani food, with notably great flavours jn parts, but worth its status as one of London's must eat spots? Firstly some Tips: book in advance, and aim for just before dinner service (5.45/6pm). Yes that queue is for reservations; you'll be swept upstairs into a lovely large series of dining rooms. The pompadums you are offered as not free, at 80P each. Also do not be afraid to wave to get attention, this place is extremely busy and fast.+ Food was delivered at a lightning fast rate, you literally wouldn't believe it. We ordered paneer tikka, 3 seekh kebabs, prawn Karahi, muttom tikka Karahi, 3 tandoori roti, 1 peshwari Naan, jug of sweetlassi.+ Seekh kebabs were delicious, best I've had in a long time. Everything else I have to say was fairly tasty but not hugely exciting.We left full and satisfied and had a good night, but I'm not in a huge rush to come back. That said, it's Lindon history so go try it!",

    "text": "I was very excited to check out this restaurant after having seen all the reviews and it certainly lived up to everything people say about it.Yes the queue (and the whole experience) is crazy, and so are people who go here without a reservation. Although actually, I'm not too sure that advanced us greatly seeing as we eventually got a table just because a waiter yelled TWO PEOPLE and someone I chatted to in the queue shoved us forward. We got to sit near the queue which was awesome because you're all like HAHA I'M EATING AND ALSO LINGERING.Following yelp reviews I ordered lamb chops and seekh kebabs, both of which were delicious although weirdly we both found that the lamb chop found underneath other food was much more tender and juicy than those on the top of the plate - sitting under lights too long? Tandoori chicken was also pretty good although no tandoori will never live up to my mum's tandoori ribs (which I recently tried to replicate with terrible results).If you're looking for a non meat dish I'd really recommend the methi. I love the fenugreek flavour and am always looking for this dish on menus since I was introduced to it a couple of years ago (by a Pakistani friend at a restaurant called Spices and Herbs in Juba, South Sudan, which is - implausibly - one of the best Indian restaurants ever, trust me. Go there if you happen to be in town).I also was really into the spicy popadom and the tandoori roti (chapati) was perfect. Which continuing on the random East Africa tangent this review has taken, reminds me of a dish called Rolex which involves an omelette wrapped in a chapati. Srsly: raebear.net/recipes/role\u2026My sister said she'd come back here, so that's her seal of approval as well as mine. Excellent value for money and fun, frantic, sizzling food.",

Good hospitality that they allow people to bring in their own beer and wine as they do not serve alcohol in the restaurant. There were many people from all walks of life around me, very pleasent atmosphere. I had the Karahi chiken, a samosa, saag aloo, rice and regular naan. Also a masala tea to end it. All the food was so fresh and flavorful. So this next week I will come here again. I like to hop on the tube, walk a mile or so to tayyabs for exercise then after dinner, head back to the hotel via a walk alomg the Thames to the Tower hill station. Wonderful journey.",

My friends both really liked it, so I'm trying not to be too moody, and give it 3 stars.Making a reservation doesn't seem to help too much with the crazily organised queueing system! We booked a table for three, and arrived a few minutes early, but didn't get to sit down for around 25 minutes. We had to wait in a squashed hallway (completely rammed with other people trying to queue) with waiters pushing past us with sizzling dishes!!One of the waiters stood on my foot, which left me in a bit of a bad mood as he was heavy and it bl***y hurt! He didn't bother to say sorry...but did knock me over as he wanted to go in the other direction. The food was good, cheap and came quite quickly once we found seats! Meh...the bad service spoilt the whole experience for me. I enjoyed the flavours, but won't bother to go back.",

    "text": "First off, I know very little about Indian/Pakistani/Punjabi cuisine, but despite that, it was almost earth shattering to me...food in the US is *okay*, had chicken tikka, naan, and lassi in Brighton (was actually *very* good).I had the Karahi Chicken main, veg samosas, garlic naan, and a mango lassi - the main was a bit piquant but very tasty of its curry sauce (I think) and the chicken was very tender. Vegetable samosas were nicely cooked and vegetables nicely done too. I think this place is the very best on garlic naan, not too powerful on the garlic but still plenty, and the naan was nicely cooked/baked. The lassi, oddly enough, I had last - and it could of been a dessert - not too sweet but yet the perfect balance of sweet, the mango flavors, and just almost velvet-like.My friend had the starter of chicken tikka, main of keema (I think), some roti, and also some lassi. Chicken tikka and keema was awesome, as was the mango lassi, but the roti was eh...I guess she didn't like it. I wasn't in the mood for the roti, so I didn't bother.Its BYOB, but they do server a few non-alcoholic drinks (and lassi) and, of course, water.Tayyebs is a bit crazy as people are eating, talking, going to their tables, getting out from their tables, looks if the place needs a renovation 10 years ago, and a bit crowded - but its all worth it for the taste of great food.The only con: because its busy and fast paced there, if you want attention (like order your food, get a table, etc), then get one of the wait staff folks - otherwise you may wait a bit more than you would like, though you'll eventually get seated or attention.Will definitely come back when in London next.",

SCORE. I ordered the SHRIMP CURRY, LAMB CHOP, NAAN, RICE and MANGO LASSI. Attempted to get the lamb curry too, but my server advised me against it. Too much food, he said, and he was right. Overall, my meal was good, but it didn't blow my mind. Maybe because it was too hyped? The lamb chop was excellently seasoned, but overcooked on the sizzling platter. I finished 85% of my meal; impressed myself and my servers. When my bill came, I noticed he didn't charge me for the shrimp dish. When I inquired, he said it was on the house. SWEET. Good food, lively atmosphere, friendly (albeit hectic) service. Totally one of the highlights of my British experience.",

We ordered the lamb chops (very tasty, not much meat), saag paneer and chicken tikka masala. It was all a bit greasy and spicy for our taste. This was the only Pakistani/Indian restaurant that we tried in London. I would recommend trying somewhere else if you want any attempt at having a conversation.",

The mango lassi is to die for. It is truly divine and I will be sorely disappointed if it is not available when I get to heaven. The restaurant is Halal meaning they do not serve alcohol, but why would you want alcohol when they have mango lassi? Service leaves a lot to be desired, as does the immense waiting time to get a seat (there is regularly a queue stretching outside the building). The food is worth the wait if you've never been there before and the prices are excellent, but it's not the sort of place you can go to if you're hungry and want to eat something quickly. Lately the quality has dropped a bit too, and I find myself going to Mirch Masala around the corner far more often, which is why I rate Tayyab's at 4 stars rather than 5.",

Queues out the door, people drooling over your shoulder as they wait for you to finish so it's then their turn to eat, curry in still simmering metal pans hovering over your head, waiters ordering though \"action man\" style radios, New Tayyabs is chaos. But in a fabulous way. I love curry, I have a set few dishes that I like, \"westerners curry\" as my Asian friends will call it but here you are pushed to try something new. Tip 1: Ask what's on the menu, find out what is in each dish and order a selection for the table.This place is BYOB so make sure you bring your own lubrication. You'll also have to wait about 40 minutes for a table even if you have booked it, prepare fr that and you won't be disappointed. Tip 2: Slip a tenner in someone's hand and I'm sure this wait will get shorter, remain polite and patient. The food is totally worth waiting for.You will leave stinking of curry, this is normal. If you haven't split it down your front it's a sign that you didn't make the most out of the night. Tip 3: Have dessert! Yes I know you are full but you really need to sample the amazingness that is the sweet treats here. I want to swim in the food here, not in a pretty way. In a dirty cover me in food I'm a glutton way. I left here and my head was spinning from the wine and my lips tingling from the spice. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT EAT ANY FOOD.However, I felt I should review the restaurant based on the experience that made me leave it before having a chance to order. Due to the nature of the food cooked there (in large metal pans, as seen in the pictures on yelp) it is a very smokey atmosphere. Add to that the fact that a lot of the spices associated with the cuisine are quite hot, and you have a recipe for disaster for anyone with asthma or breathing problems. While my friend and I tried to last it out, we both ended up having to ask to be relocated away from the cooking area. Our waiter told us we would have to talk to the manager, who came about ten minutes later. He said of course, and moved us around the corner. Unfortunately, it was still exceptionally smokey and we were both actively coughing. We told him this, and he tried to tell us we were wrong. So we pointed to the inches of smoke clinging to the ceiling. At this point, he offered us a table on the other side (one that we had originally asked for) but we felt put off by the whole experience, and the coughing, so we went back to a standby favorite on brick lane proper. As a second note, the table beside us also had to leave before they had eaten any food because the woman was allergic to onions. We heard their conversation with the manager (as the restaurant does put you in quite close quarters) and apparently, though the waiter had been informed, they were brought numerous dishes with onions, which they kept having to send back. At that point, no longer trusting that things would be cooked in an allergen-free way for customers with health issues, they chose to leave. All this being said, loads of people were there and seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food. Also, the dessert bar looks fantastic.

Very well priced (15 pounds per person, ate till we dropped). \u00a0While it is a bit out of the way, it is WELL worth the trek. \u00a0Do not forget to book a table. We went on a Wednesday and there was not a SINGLE seat available so make sure to book well in advance or be prepared to wait. \u00a0Also, be patient, as the place is so full that you will wait a bit for some of your dishes.Last wort of advice, do not miss the lamb chops. Wow. Simply wow.",

This is largely due to the consistent and everlasting que that instantly prompts me to venture further along. While this definite sign of popularity is a bonus to the reputation of the business I do not enjoy waiting in a long que through a crowed and smokey environment only to be let down by bad service and sheer irritation of having to shout at my guests over the cramped and chaotic atmosphere.While I am sure Tayyabs reputation was warranted at some point in its thirty years of trading I feel that these days it is merely riding the wave of its past splendour. While the food is mediocre, I tried the Tikka chicken, Saag aloo and Briyani, it is the immensely poor service that really lets it down.The venue does not have a licence you are welcome to bring along your own tipple.",

Yes, you will likely have to wait for a table in a long line, yes you will rub shoulders with your neighbours, and yes you will almost certainly smell like curry for days afterwards. No, you wont have intimate privacy at your table and no, they won't encourage you to linger for hours over your dinner, staring adoringly into your date's eyes and nursing a bottle of BYOB vino. But damn, the food is really, really tasty. If you go early to beat the crowds and are prepared to deal with the noise and the hustling waiters, you will reap the rewards of hot, spicy, perfectly seasoned Pakistani dishes that leave you wanting more even though you're too full to contemplate another mouthful. \u00a0The biggest downsides: 1) \u00a0it's a trek to get to Whitechapel, and 2) Tayyabs has ruined me for a lot of lesser Indian and Pakistani places throughout London which I would have otherwise naively enjoyed.",

Every other time, I've just decided to go to Lahore instead. This one time... no. I WAS DETERMINED to get into Tayyabs. Without a doubt, go early. We congregated outside the restaurant around 5, and it still was a 15 minute wait (granted there were 8 of us). The papadums were fresh and crispy and tasted like home... The dipping sauces were not too sweet nor sour nor spicy. Yum! I have to say, the place doesn't disappoint. Everything from the Chicken Tandoori (which is the most moist I've ever tasted Tandoori to be - even compared to some of the places in Singapore) to the famous Lamb Chops... The only thing that was a bit off the mark was the Chana Masala... But otherwise, everything I mean everything was good. Also - CHEAP. We stuffed with naan, rice and lots of curry and grilled meats all for a measly \u00a312 a person. Unbelievable. Will I go back? YES! I mean, I gotta come here as many times as I've been to Lahore Kebab House just to atone for my sins (or abstinence really). Definitely good. Definitely worth the wait.",

The restaurant is huge, so I don't imagine it took too long, but air on the side of caution. We started with popodoms and 3 sauces, which were all equally amazing, the yogurt sauce had a kick that was fantastic! We ordered the lamb, a chicken tikka masala, sag aloo, chick peas and loads of naan. Everything was better than the dish before. Tender meat, so much flavor, comes out very quickly and very hot. Its also BYOB so we brought loads of wine and fizz. This also helped cut down on price. It was just over a tenner per person to be stuffed full of food and walking out a bit tipsy.. you cannot beat it! \u00a0All in all, I will be back again and again because it was so good!

In London, Indian food looks fancy and goes for \u00a315 or more. Dang...The food itself was yummy, but not that much more amazing than my favorite local place in SF. What makes this place a 5 star for me are two things: Naan and Mango Lassi.The Naan was SO FLUFFY. It had a bit of crisp on the outside, but was mostly soft, pillowy, and just yummy. The Mango Lassi was just super yummy. They must have found the ripest mangos in all of London. So glad we ordered a jug of that, because it was just amazing.",

A lot of waiters are going in and out, so I would recommended not to be seated next to the kitchen. The kitchen is open, you can smell the food from the adjacent tables, another reason not to go approach the kitchen.Naan was delicious too, go for the garlic naan.Service is nice but sometimes hard to catch.

    "text": "This is pretty much reached the point of beating a dead horse but I'm highly opinionated so I'm going to contribute to the endless reviews that has told you that this place is great. Tayyabs is... mental. I use the term endearingly, much in the same way Ron Weasley continuously refers to Hermione's antics as \"mental.\" My coursemates and I, about 13 of us, decided to have dinner here for a final summer dinner before we all parted ways and when we arrived I was staggered by the amount of people on a WEDNESDAY EVENING. It was at dinner rush, our reservations were for 7:30 pm but thank god my classmates had gone here before or else I would not have known to reserve. So if there's anything that you should take away from this... if you want a guaranteed seat make a reservation. The decor was interesting, a bit chic and mod with neon lights. It has no kitschy Indian decor to dress up the atmosphere, it's almost like a night club. Overall, my first impression was chaos... but like an organized chaos. It seemed like all the servers, despite the massive amount of people crowding the doors, knew exactly what to do and where to go. Since it was such a busy night, we were left to peruse the menu with some poppadums and a trio of sauces for a generous amount of time. Eventually it took some serious flagging skills and a complete disregard for British propriety and subtlety to finally grab the waiters attention to let him know we were ready to order. But the most impressive part of the night was when the waiter came around to take our order. Among the 13 or 14 of our group, we all ordered a variety of starters, mains, and rice/naans. It was a hodge podge of a few starters, a myriad of mains, and different varieties of naans. The waiter remembered it all, no pad, no pencil. To our astonishment, he repeated the whole order verbatim without any missed dishes. My coursemates (who the majority of us have worked at least once in the service industry) gave him a well deserved and very awestruck round of applause. I know it may have been premature because the food hadn't arrived but damn... that takes some skill. I'm not going to speak much on the food. It was good and as it has been said repeatedly and several different ways the lamb chops were delicious; the dry meat was a bit more lack luster. But from what I gather Tayyabs is an institution in London, it's a place that everyone must try. The food is good and the atmosphere is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't know what it is but it could be the fact that very few restaurants are able to nurture a fun atmosphere without having their customers having to shell out more money for it; a part of it understands that dining in good company with good food is enough to make a night fantastic.",

It's in a sketchy part of town, but believe me, it's well worth it! Hold on to your bag, honey, and scurry yourself over to this place. Walking in, you'll be overwhelmed by the amount of people. When I say that, believe me, there are A LOT of people waiting for a table! \u00a0They have guys standing around wearing \"Tayyabs Crowd Control\" vests - not kidding! Really GOOD food without the hole in the wall atmosphere. The restaurant was actually really cute. They move people through surprisingly quick. The place is super loud, you can barely hear the person sitting across from you. Please do not forget to order a jug, yes a jug, of their Mango Lassi. It will shoot you straight up the heaven and back, it's that good! Everything we ordered was scrumptious. The Keema Naan was the best - so buttery and flavorful; I'm on the brink of drooling just thinking about it. Their Chutneys, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Kabobs, Lamb Chops, Raita - all GOOD! The only thing that I don't recommend is the Samosas, they were definitely not authentic.",

You won't get the usual fare though, so if you want a chicken korma you may find yourself left wanting. Just order whatever tickles your fancy and you'll probably end up happy. And they don't mention spiciness so if you particularly do / don't want spice, let them know. The service is also great, our waiter got a standing ovation for remembering all 16 meals without a pen and paper. He also pulled the \"I don't work here\" joke to dramatic effect. Well played sir. \u00a0Well played. The atmosphere can be anything from withheld to... \u00a0Boisterous. I think they'll try and sit you in an area that reflects your group. 10 tweenagers will end up in the silly room etc. Book ahead. They get incredibly busy. That's pretty much all I have on this one. Good food. Good service. Oh and BYOB. Which is always wonderful.",

The waiters were not great at explaining what the different dishes are, probably catering to a more knowledgeable audience The atmosphere was very busy and crowded, and as we were sitted next to the entrance, 70% of what I heard during my visit (the remaining being my brother talk) was big groups complaining on why they cannot be seated before everyone in their party arrives at the restaurant. I had heard that since Tayyabs has become very popular they have expanded their space maybe \"too much,\" and that was indeed the feeling I got. Big kudos for being BYO!",

Certainly possible. And this place has been around for decades. You do not want to go to Brick Lane. You want to come here. And BYOB.You can read the other reviews that talk about the ambiance and whatnot.I'll cut straight to the point. Here is what you want to order:1. Chili lamb chops. They come out in a massive cloud of smoke spice. Eat all the grilled onions that accompany them.2. Dry meat. It is not dry at all. It is delicious. Where were you all my life, dry meat?3. Chana4. Urid dal5. Something else from the veggie list -- okra, baby pumpkin, change it up to spice up your life.Gluten free notes: I eat here all the time with no problems, though I have not attempted to verify what is or is not gluten free.

Lamb chops are the popular dish here but I liked the kahari chicken keema (ground chicken curry) and the dry meat (lamb cooked in curry sauce till the sauce is concentrated). The meats were juice and flavorful. Highly recommend those dishes. Also had the daal, mixed vegetables, and garlic naan, which were average but good. The only thing I didn't like was the burnt onion chips that topped most of the dishes. It's a loud crowded restaurant but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated on an early Friday evening.",

    "text": "Tayyabs. To me it's an institution not only of East London but London itself. I've had 3 different groups of foreign friends come over in the last year and the first place I take them to introduce them to a bit of London cultural food is here at Tayyabs. It's not just that you can bring your own booze (offies nearby), it's not just that the queues EVERY day show that repeated business is showing it to be success, it's not just the place is huge. I swear I've been about 30 times and there seems to be more and more rooms that I never knew existed. It's cheap but most of all the food is exceptional. I love the curry's I really do. They are all tasty and if you look online you will see daily specials that are worth getting. Also 'dry' curry is not dry at all. It's probably one of the best. But it's the starters that I come back for again and again and again and again. It's these that I ALWAYS order. I love the chops. Ah those lamb chops sizzling toward the table. And the Sheekh kebabs....the Panneer Tikka...the Chicken Tikka. These FOUR you pretty much should get. I've been a few times when this is all I ordered for myself. It's that good. If you're really hungry of course go forth and get a curry and naans. Share those if need be. But always get those starters. The Lamb Chops if you've done your research needs no selling. It's the best in London. And though you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer...I would recommend (speaking as an Asian person myself) get a Mango Lassi. It's strange that my non Asian friends have rarely had this. I grew up having this mango pulp and yogurt drink that is fruity, creamy and smooth. it's ace. I'd actually prefer to have this than the booze with my curry to be honest. Yogurt is traditional to help cool you when eating hot food. So...what are you waiting for....GO! It's defo in my Top 5 places to eat in London. Enjoy!",

I did like the sundries we had (naan bread etc) but it's hard for me to get over the fact that my plate looked like it had come straight from the Deepwater Horizon accident.Most of my friends rave about the lamb chops, which were tasty but not sufficiently so that I'd forget about everything else.In the UK, Indian food has this reputation of being unhealthy, rich and you'd think after the decades that Bengalis and Brick Lane had been here, they would have at least tried to change this image.

    "text": "thefoodseeker.comWhen venturing out to London, it is only customary to have a good curry during your visit. A patient of mine had recommended this place, which was recommended to him by the celebrity food critic Simon Majumdar (a UK native). Known for their lamb chops, the restaurant was started by Mohammed Tayyab and has been within the family for over 30 years. Their use of spices is generally tasted in every dish. When seeking Tayyabs, the closest tube stops are either Aldgate East or Whitechapel. It is definitely a bit hidden in an alleyway, but as soon as you see the bright blue lights and the crowd of people standing in the queue, you know you found the right place. An array of desserts is displayed upon entering the door. People huddle around waiting for their names to be called as the smell of succulent lamb is within their grasp. Tayyabs is a BYOB eatery, so walk over to the nearest off-license or Tesco as soon as you get off the tube stop. And....don't forget to make a reservation for this place! Trust me on this one. It can be done online in less than 2 minutes.Pappadums as well as a salad were provided, along with three different sauces complimentary to the start of the meal. The sauces range from spicy, to a sweet chutney and a cooling creamy sauce. All delicious!LAMB CHOPS ( \u00a36.50 FOR 4 PIECES): My favorite dish. The chops are delivered in 4 pieces, topped with a tomato and served on a bed of grilled onions. This dish could easily be ordered for each individual. The chops were succulent, rubbed with their own spices and provided with enough heat as to not overwhelm the palate. Is it the best chops I've ever had in my life? I wouldn't say so, but it definitely is ranked high up there and worth a try! KEEMA NAAN (\u00a32.75): A definite must order. The naan was so fresh and stuffed with minced meat, onions, green chili, and garlic. The bread glistened under the light, waiting to be engulfed by the hungry individuals. CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA (\u00a37.75): The dish is definitely not your normal chicken tikka masala you would find in the States. It contains karahi masala, coriander aka cilantro, onions and chilis. It definitely has a kick so utilize the sauces and the naan. The dish definitely goes well over basmati rice and you can bet your buttons that the chicken was not overcooked or dry! KARAHI GOSHT LAMB (\u00a37.00 SMALL): This is my favorite of the two curries. Why? The lamb just melts in your mouth and provides enough heat from the chilis and spices for the dish. Again, naan and basmati rice are a must with this dish. GARLIC NAAN (\u00a32.00): Order this if you feel like having bread without the stuffing. It is pillowy, soft, and oh so delicious with just the right amount of garlic!PISTA KULFI AND MANGO KULFI (\u00a32.75 EACH): And just when you thought you were done, you're not. This is a must to finish off the meal. It's ice cream with the creamiest texture in popsicle form. Don't mind the wrapping or the shape of the popsicle. You won't care once you want to cool off your tongue and sink your teeth into these. There are other varieties, but we chose these flavors. No disappointment whatsoever. Overall, it was a lovely meal shared amongst friends (family style) without breaking the wallet. We each paid \u00a320 with tip and the meal left us thinking about the lamb once more.",

(Dry meat garlic, chilli, turmeric and beef), this was also amazing, spicy but not too hot. \u00a0Along with that I had saag paneer, which was a partial let down of the evening. \u00a0While well spiced and flavorful, it came absolutely swimming in oil, again it was good but for a vegetarian dish I was hoping it would be a bit lighter and the oil just seemed excessive. \u00a0Lastly I rounded out my meal with garlic naan, which was also slightly disappointing only because it was under cooked. \u00a0I think another minute or two in the oven and it probably would have been perfect. \u00a0And finally a banana lassi to wash it all down. \u00a0The banana had been raved about by a couple yelpers, it was good but I think I'll stick with mango in the future. \u00a0Still a delicious meal!",

However the food and electric atmosphere \u00a0would bring me back into Tayyabs",

The biryani specialty is good, the nihari specialty is decent too, and I want to try them all! The naans are amazing when they come to the table fresh and piping hot. One time I took a friend, the naan was not so good as usual, but otherwise I have found it to be excellent. I think the plain naans are better than the others I tried as well. My husband loves the seekh kabab here too. The palak gosht is decent too and the prices are very good.The kulfi here is amazing and they have the equally good pistachio flavour as well. The place is always packed so I assume everyone else knows how good it is too:) I'd advise getting a reservation if you can, the line gets long. It's not a fancy place but if you want to go somewhere casually, it's great!! Takeaway is fine too, but if you eat in it's always better.",

My father is visiting and is really into authentic Indian food so I decided to bring him here. I booked because I didn't want us to have to wait although this now seems pointless, because there was no queue. It was actually the quietest I've seen it. And yet, they still wouldn't seat us until the fourth person in our party arrived. So even if you book a table, you still wait. This is a ridiculous policy and is clearly because they want you to eat, take your money and get you out ASAP. This was the case the whole evening and, let's face it, Tayyabs popularity is not what it was so they don't need to turn tables so quickly. They came over and hustled us into ordering and were so unclear about everything. It's so loud, you can barely hear what they are saying. I went to the bathroom after we ordered and when I returned, both our starters and mains were on the table. FFS. Starters are meant to come BEFORE the mains, not altogether so they can make you leave faster. It was very unpleasant and the same thing was happening to all the other tables. The food itself was fine, but nothing special. I actually preferred an Indian meal we went to in my hometown of Cork two weeks ago! The BYOB thing is great and it's cheap enough,but I'm over their crappy service. Tayyabs, I won't be back. Your food just isn't that good to warrant shoveling it down in two minutes.",

Garlic naan is average, but chicken tikka soft and tasty. Rice is simply superb. The sugar tooth would be disappointed by the kheer, but I relished its subtler notes, even after medium hot curries. I would not bring in most of my French friends though, as virtues were to my taste: they would burn their mouth, kill their taste, mar their pleasure.I dined there alone, conversation would have been difficult as the place is crowded and rather noisy. But I enjoyed my meal nonetheless and had no problem metabolizing it - as sometimes happened when I Indian-dine in Paris.",

Came with two friends right before 7 and we were seated after a 5 min wait (the line and wait became much longer after 730). To start each table is given a plate of delicious papadum and three chutneys. We ordered the chicken tikka masala (delicious), karage chicken (a bit of a cinnamon kick, very unique), garlic naan , rice, daal (my favorite dish of the night), eggplant (really good), and a jug of mango lasse (they ran out of banana). Had we been bigger lamb fans we would have ordered their dry meat. Overall it was a great meal, really lively ambiance, and an affordable 43GBP total! Highly recommend coming and bringing a few bottles of wine or beer -- it's BYOB -- better value than Dishoom.",

The chicken tikka though was dry and the paneer tikka rubbery. Kheema was a nice spicy gravy that went great with the rotis. The biryani was tasty, but I was quite put off with the addition of peas and other veggies in a mutton biryani.Tayyabs is great VFM, but not a \"return to\" on my list.",

Nothing special, but fresh and tasty. My friend had the karahi fish tikka masala which was by far the best. The naan was also \u00a0good. For this, I'd come again.But the service.... we were served poppadoms and once the waiter had taken our mains order, it was served within LESS THAN 5 MINUTES! We hadn't even finished our poppadoms! Any plate we finished with was instantly removed from our table and hot towels were brought over the second I finished my food. Never mind that my friend was still eating!I couldn't help it and timed how long it would take for the couple, who sat down next to us, to be served their food after their order was taken. By that time the place was busier than when we ordered and still it only took 6:22 min for the mains to arrive and once again, they hadn't yet finished their poppadoms either.The service was so fast but really not so friendly that it impacted the experience as a whole. A shame.PS: For truly amazing Bangladeshi food, please try Chilliz on Brick Lane. Divine!",

Therefore I get to enjoy most of tayyabs cooking (yay!) all to myself. Though it was definitely flavourful the only fault I could point out is that the dishes were greasy and oily.Otherwise, I will continue to visit Tayyab to satisfy my Indian food craving but perhaps only once a year to prevent the plaque formation in my arteries.",

    "text": "Tayyabs, Tayyabs. You have pissed me off, royally.We organised a joint going away dinner as my friend and I are leaving our jobs for the bigger and better in the great beyond that is the corporate world...but I digress! Tayyabs was our choice of a restaurant and from the beginning of our visit, it was an unsettling experience!Tayyabs is PACKED. You need a reservation. What they don't tell you? All of your party NEEDS to be present in order for you to be seated. The attitude they give you immense - how DARE you show up to dinner with 99% of your party due to a friend being late? You have to wait in the limited seating area - with sticky floors beneath you - or outside, with heaps of trash (alluring aroma in the heat, let me tell you). Those are your choices. All this was fine - we kept quiet and waited for all our party to arrive and were seated. Everything about this experience was sub-part. I am not someone who believes you should accept shit service for good food. To be honest - Tayyabs didn't blow my mind in terms of cuisine. I have eaten in some of the best Indian restaurants in the country - hell, the world, and this didn't stack up enough that I would ignore rude comments, menus being shoved into my hand, having to beg for drinks or even any attention. Dinner was rushed - the menu is limited for vegetarians and the options are standard for Indian restaurants. The hygiene (or lack thereof) in the downstairs area of the restaurant kind of put you off eating there, but you keep quiet and eat - and the food isn't bad. I ate dinner with people who work in fine dining and they weren't pleased by anything and it's not because they are picky. It was almost as if I was asking for the world when I asked where our missing items were - everything was a bother. It reeked, the servers were rude and condescending, the food was so-so and the ambiance was non-existent. I'll skip Tayyabs - and the hassle - in the future.",

The punters seem to agree with that opinion as the place was packed out and we were lucky to get a table at 6PM on a Monday.The food was ok but not as good as the reputation suggested. My problem was that the place seemed like a production line, trying to move people out as quickly as possible. Our starters arrived and almost instantly the main course arrived leaving us with a crowded table. As a curry fan I just didn't get a great vibe from this place.",

    "text": "I'm a bit shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet. It ranks as one of the best Indian joints in London beating out Lahore Kebab House, Mirch Masala, and my newly discovered Simply Indian. As most people have said, the lamb chops are definitely a must have with tender meat, laden with spices, and grilled to provide that nice almost charred crust. You can't really go wrong with the usual slew of curries (I typically aim for a good lamb jalfrezi or vindaloo for my heat fix) and the garlic naan is buttery and crispy as it should be.Ordering is an exercise in efficiency but if you ask nicely they will provide some suggestions. Just make up your mind quickly as the waiters tend to get a bit impatient. I've never had a problem with being seated with the longest wait (for a group of 10) being 15 minutes but we've also never been later than 6.30pm.Added bonus is the BYO status which allows you to pop into the off license next door (that place must do killer business) and grab a couple bottles of wine or a crate of beer and plonk it down on the table without worrying about a corkage fee.Overall, its good tasty Indian food at a pretty cheap price and beats anything Brick Lane has to offer hands down. It also works wonders as a pre-night out dinner stop but make sure to grab some gum from the off license too as garlic and curry breath is rarely a winner with the ladies!",

That line through the restaurant is quite annoying- both for it's length and for it's presence.Service: They're fast, I admit it and they got everything right!Food: Okay, where do I begin???- The free pompadams were good too. Spicy with a kick and it was great fun putting on all the dips! Especially the Mango Chutney: We asked for 3 refills. Yes, THREE. It was so good on literally everything!!!- Peshwari Naan- big, fluffy. Don't underestimate how full this makes you. I wanted to try this one as it was different from what I usually get. It was sweet and stuff, but with all the curries and stuff that we had, I actually prefer plain or garlic naan just to match it up.- Chicken Curry- Man, I really wish I remembered which one I ordered. But I can guarantee you it doesn't matter which one you order. It will be good.- Lamb chops- we got this to share and in my opinion, they're a bit smaller than I expected. It's still good, but maybe it's the American in me that I want/expect everything to be bigger?- Mango Lassi- GET IT WHEN YOU GO. BEST LASSI I HAVE EVER EVER HAD!!! Oh, my mouth is drooling as I think about it. Creamy, not too thick and PERFECT with your meal. Get a jug and share--for the four of us, we didn't think it would be enough but it was a perfect amount especially since we were so full from our actual food anyway.Bottom Line: The wait is obnoxious and it is overhyped. But man, I cannot deny how CHEAP and how DELICIOUS and FUN this place was. BYOB is a brilliant idea and it just about makes up for it. Though make reservations when you can!!!!!",

Food comes quickly too, although not sure if that is a good or a bad thing! In terms of dishes, there are limited choices, and no beef or pork, so its between chicken, prawns, lamb, and veggies. I can recommend the lamb chop, which turned out to be like spare ribs instead, but still very tasty! The curries are oily as most indian/pakistani places are, but the meat is very tender and its all very tasty. Oh and btw, the restaurant is BYO for free, so you can save alot on drinks by bringing your own! Also they don't serve alcohol, something to note if you like having a drink with your meal.

Our group was 8 people, and we ordered: 4 Lamb Chop and 4 Kebab appetizers for the table, 2 pitchers of Mango Lassi, 6 Large entrees from Karahi Gosht (lamb - one of the best things on the menu!) to Dry Lamb to Chicken Tikka Masala, 3 plates of Pilau rice, and lots of Nan for a grand total of \u00a3145. \u00a0Go ahead and do that math.Things you must eat there:-Lamb Chops-Dry Lamb-Karahi Gosht or Karahi Dhal Gosht (Curried Lamb)-Allo Gosht - (a mixed curried meat and potatoes thing)-Karahi Bindi (Curried Pumpkin - don't laugh, its amazing)-Mango Lassi-NanThe last thing to note is that Tayyabs is BYOB, so if you want to drink (which you should, beer is great with curried food), bring it with you. \u00a0There are several grocery stores and off-licenses conveniently located nearby.As Lizzie said, New Tayyabs might be chaos, but it is delicious - and inexpensive! - chaos.",

Sure, seeing Lizzie G and Miriam W would be highlights, but in my eye it was all about the Indian eats. The line at New Tayyabs wraps around the already cramped restaurant, ramping up the temperature indoors. Seriously, it was hot as Hades in here. And that's spoken by an Atlantan who's used to heat. It's hot. Wear as little clothing as possible during the summer, especially if you want to try their spicier dishes.It didn't help that they were overwhelmed by the crowd and therefore slow on the water refills: it was seriously disgustingly hot in there, to the point I couldn't appreciate my food to the level I knew I should.While the chicken tikka masala looked unlike any other version of the dish I had ever had, it was definitely delicious, as were the other foods I took advantage of that night. I didn't have anything that steered me the wrong way, and I left New Tayyabs fully aware of what London had to offer, and wanting more.",

    "text": "Tayyab is an Pakistani/Indian restaurant in East London near the Whitechapel tube station. Having previously lived in London, I always make a special point to come back to Tayyab when I am in town. Tayyab is by far the best Pakistani/Indian food I have had and comes with a very only-locals-know-about-this-place vibe. Tayyab is BYOB (there are numerous Off-License stores along the walk from the Whitechapel station) and unless you call and make reservations the day before or early the day of, you will likely have to cue for a table (reservations are highly recommended). Poppadums with the three classic mango, mint, and chutney sauces begin the meal. The chicken tikka for an appetizer is wonderful and served on the hot plate with peppers and onions. The main dishes are all great (thought not diet friendly given the amount of oil used to prepare them), though I would recommend anything with lamb in it. Make sure to get a homemade naan to accompany the sauces of the main dishes. While I typically do not get dessert, there is a counter on the way out that has the classic desserts of the region.The prices are one of the key sellers of this place. Appetizers like chicken tikka are around \u00a33.50, mains are around \u00a37-12, and sides like rice and naan around \u00a32.50-3. Even at my most hungry times, an appetizer, main, and one order of naan are overfilling. A full meal can easily be under \u00a315 each. Just remember to pick up wine and beer on the way to the restaurant. The atmosphere has changed considerably from when I first came to Tayyab years ago. In the past, small rooms to the left and right of the entrance on the ground floor were the only spaces available for dinner. Now, a full upstairs is also available. The decor has also become significantly nicer. Unfortunately, this means a large number of diners are eating simultaneously, meaning that service is slower and sometimes inaccurate. While the staff always try to correct the errors, it is challenging to gain their attention most of the time (we had to get up a few times to grab a bottle opener or waiter for more water). The atmosphere of years ago had better service, but the quality of the food still outweighs the poorer service to keep me coming back.The dining atmosphere is quite packed and it can become difficult to hear your companions if not sitting close to one another (this is a side-effect of the upstairs expansion as well). If you are looking for a quiet or romantic location, this is probably not the place to meet. However, if you are looking for an informal, reasonable, and authentic Pakistani/Indian restaurant, Tayyab is a perfect choice.",

We ordered:King Prawn Curry: The most upscale and sophisticated curry I've ever eaten. The king prawn made the dish so delicate yet so tasty!Lamb chops: A must try!Chicken tikka: Perfect blend of spices for a rich complex flavor.Oh yeah don't forget to BYOB!!! Definitely worth the visit. Don't fret the long lines, it goes by really quick!",

    "text": "The food here is excellent. I got the lamb chop masala, which was perfectly cooked, and the veggie samosa was arguably the best I have ever had.However,I came alone in the evening when it was quite crowded, and was made to feel very uncomfortable by the staff. One waiter in particularly purposely blocked my path as he directed me to my table, and when i tried to go around him he would block the other side, until i just squeezed past and he very blatantly grazed my chest with both hands. I am disgusted and never thought I would be sexually harrassed by a restaurant staff member when there were so many people around.",
