    "text": "I am eternally grateful to the friend who introduced me to this place. You know who are are. Nestled in a back street off Columbia Road, the Stringray cafe looks like a travellers bar cum local pub. It's only when you get a bit closer and spot the delicious looking pizza crusts on the plates of the brave souls who sit outside that you realise you're here for the food. There's a reason why people sit outside too..it gets busy. The cafe itself only has about ten candle-lit tables, a curved small bar selling good beer on tap and a huge clay pizza oven where you can watch the breads, pizzas and calzone double in size and deliciousness. Every pizza I've ever had here has been brilliant. They have thin crunchy and tasty bases, rich basily tomato sauce, stringy mozzarella, and a whole array of ingredients to plonk on top. You can choose one of the 15 or so predesigned pizzas or have it your way and design it from scratch. Being a creature of habit when it comes to pizza I always have something with aubergines, parma ham and artichokes. The parma ham is salty and silky smooth, the aubergines are chargrilled and the artichokes have some bite and are slighty vinegary. Smothered with the homemade chilli oil and its perfect. But my expensive pizza taste isn't actually expensive here. That concoction only puts me back \u00a36.10. And it's too big to eat. With Staropramen at \u00a32.90 per pint I cannot complain. Don't miss out on this little gem but never forget to book.",

    "text": "Stingray Globe- sort out your staff! If I was only reviewing the food here it would be five stars all the way. Pizza's are thin and crispy, packed with toppings and ridiculously cheap (between \u00a34.50 and \u00a37)! Bacon, red onion and mushroom- oh so good! The 'American hot' was tasty too but the hidden jalapenos knocked me for six at little. Drinks are also very reasonable and they serve proper syrupy draught coke. Yum! Sadly however, your staff refuse to communicate with the customers, or even each other. I watched two tables of five being turned away because there was a queue of people waiting. Fair enough you might think however, everyone in this queue was waiting for tables of two. They lost ten customers and had half the restaurant sitting empty...so silly! Eventually we were seated but then asked to move again- twice! I'm sure it was as a result of this that we were given the wrong order and had to wait extra long for the replacement. Although I would say that the food was worth the wait this service can make the Globe experience fairly frustrating. Essentially they rely on the customers keeping them right and have even gone to the lengths of placing a 'sign-in' sheet for those waiting to be seated. Make sure you put your name down here as soon as you arrive or you'll be forced to the back of the queue. The Ritz it aint and sadly bad service seems to be an essential component of any Globe experience. Take it on the chin though because I promise, once your food arrives, all will be forgiven!",

    "text": "Stringray Globe Cafe - Pics @ The London FoodieI have been to Stringray many times and have enjoyed my pizze there on most occasions - the few times I didn't were when I was turned away as Stringray is nearly always full with locals and Columbia Road shoppers. \u00a0Every time I visit, the waiting staff seems to have changed. This is not a good sign, but despite this and the erratic service, Stringray's pizze are good, and so I return.Luckily, I was not turned away last Wednesday as my old friends Eduardo and Gary of Columbia Road's Start Cafe invited me to join them for a pizza there.The decor is quite simple but warm and welcoming - this is a cheap and cheerful pizzeria, with a lively atmosphere and no frills. It has a fireplace and a long-bar, and discreet lighting. This is great place to enjoy a nicely made pizza and beer on tap in a relaxed setting.We ordered a bottle of \"Italian Prosecco\" @ \u00a316.95, and \"garlic bread with cheese\" @ \u00a34.50 whilst we mulled over our pizze choices. The garlic bread was fantastic - a \"sauceless\" and very thin pizza base had been covered with mozzarella cheese and chopped fresh garlic to make a simple but delicious starter.Stringray's menu is rather straight forward and well priced - in addition to about 9 \"antipasti\" choices, the menu comprises pizza and pasta options and three meat choices (fish, chicken and steak). Pizza prices vary from \u00a34.95 to \u00a36.95.As always, we went for pizza, our choices were \"Four Cheeses\" @ \u00a36.25, \"American Hot\" @ \u00a36.25, and \"Neptuno\" @ \u00a35.95. I love their Four Cheeses pizza and order it regularly. This time was no exception - the pizza was as good as ever - cheesy and delicious with an ultra thin base. Stringray's pizza has a completely different style than Pizza East or Rossopomodoro's where the bases are thicker and have more of a bite to them (which I also love).Gary's \"American Hot\" was reasonably good although I felt that the pepperoni meat tasted slightly too processed for my liking.Eduardo's choice \"Neptuno\" was topped with tuna, olives, capers and onions. The tuna tasted like it had been taken straight out of a tin and contained no cheese which detracted from the overall experience. Other pizze that I have sometimes are \"Boscaiola\" (tomato, mozzarella, mushroom, bacon and onions) @ \u00a35.95, and \"Quattro Stagione\" (tomato, mozzarella, mushroom, capers & olives, anchovies and ham) @ \u00a36.50, they are usually pretty good too.Verdict - If you can get a table at this very popular East End Pizzeria, you will enjoy a competently made, thin crust pizza at very reasonable prices. Quality of ingredients can be variable and service erratic.",

Since moving away from London I still dream of The Globe's \"American Hot\" pizza, washed down with their hearty, satisfying, and ludicrously inexpensive house red wine. The service is, at times, exasperating in its inefficiency and unfriendliness (I came here on my birthday one year and was given a horrible table even though I'd come in earlier that day to make the reservation in person, and they had confirmed the table after I had cheerfully spoken to them about the one I wanted), but the food, the drinks EVERYTHING, is incredible. I've come here with just about everyone I know in London, brought my parents here, and there's not one thing on the menu that's ever been anything less than fabulous.",

    "text": "Great comfort food for a cold winters day!Sunday lunch at Columbia market has so many choices, however we opted for the Stingray Globe as many others had a waiting list, or were rammed full.We opted for the vegetarian Calzone, pumpkin and goats cheese salad (starter) and \u00a0polenta chips (with tapenade) to share.Portion sizes were very good and the place itself had a warm vibe and d\u00e9cor, however whilst the food was okay, it wasn't very flavoursome.I did like the thin edges for the Calzone and it was stuffed with filling. But it was rather bland and the dough was very floury. Whilst this I'm sure this would appeal to others, I do rather like rich food and adding chilli oil just didn't cut it!The polenta chips were also a let down and came out lukewarm.I also wasn't very impressed with the plastic glasses they gave us when we ordered water. I'm not sure if this is a policy of theirs, however it felt very cheap.However it answered a need, it wasn't terrible and for under \u00a320 for two people who left full, it's not bad value. That they have gluten free pizza's is also a bonus, and I could see coming back here if I had an intolerant friend, however with all the choice in the local area and without this constraint, I won't be back in a rush.",

    "text": "I'm slightly in two minds about writing this review as this place is so good that I kind of want to keep it a secret! I love Stringray because I get to eat normally! Being gluten-free normally means requesting a gluten-free menu or allergen chart and cross referencing what you can and can't have! Not here, the menu clearly states that they can do both the pizza and pasta gluten-free and they even have gluten-free beer available. They used to have Crop Circle but the last few times I've been in I've had the Daura and both are delicious.Normally gluten-free pizzas are substantially smaller than their gluten cousins but not here, they are huge and I often end up taking some home with me because I just can't manage it all. Now as a regular, I have made the bold decision on a few times to step away from the pizza and try some of the pasta dishes which are equally delicious.Stringray is great because it serves honest, hearty food and is very reasonably priced. The service is great and restaurant is well located on Columbia road which options to sit out or in. In the evening, they have patio heaters on so its always warm. Stringray is a true gem and well worth a visit...just don't tell too many of your friends.",

    "text": "1. Cheap 2. Huge portions 3. Tastes delicOne of my favorite pizza joints in London. The price is sooo right for the huge pizza you get. If you order the calzone, it's the size of a 1 month old baby. The pizza is not only huge, but toppings are plenty and the crust is delic. You don't feel ripped off at all. I always have some left over and get a takeaway box. *The garlic bread order is basically a whole pizza, but garlic and cheese. So be prepared to share with 5 ppl, unless this will be your main order. There's usually always a wait and typically I don't have the patience or personality for long waits for a table, but for me, this place is worth it. Just try to avoid peaks times, ie) Saturday & Sunday noon. Easy peasy.",

    "text": "Was up in Columbia Road a few weeks ago as I'd not been up there before . Stupidly, I had taken no cash with me, so popped into this place for a bit of lunch as it accepted card (rule number one: ALWAYS take cash to Columbia Road).Being a Sunday on Columbia Road, it was of course rammed with people, but the staff seemed new to this. I think it's just the way it's run as a family-run affair, but as a customer it seemed chaotic. I wondered around what is essentially an old pub set-up for ten minutes being completely ignored, so I finally asked someone for a menu and sat outside. Once I was served however, the staff were lovely.I didn't have the pizza, but just had a latte and the soup of the day - Spinach and Garlic which sounded wonderful. However, I was slightly disappointed. Now, I LOVE garlic. Loveitloveitloveit. But I could have killed any vampire within a ten foot radius of my breath with the amount of garlic in that soup. The only bonus was that soup was served with plenty of bread and butter which is great, and the portion is generous. The latte was watery milkiness and not very strong with coffee at all.For the price it was passable, but I wouldn't go back. Not when some of the shops nearby were selling some rather awesome looking breaded prawns.....",

The Gluten free Pizza was a very happy surprise, not to mention it was HUGE (gluten free pizzas are usually smaller) . We left happy and full. The crowd was really varied, for being pretty much East London. \u00a0There was a teenagers birthday party there and the staff seemed just lovely to them. You don't see much of that in central London, so it must be a good thing. Loved it, would go back for casual dining.",

Pizza tastes great as well. \u00a0I've only been there on Sundays after strolling down Columbia Road Flower market and therefore it's packed. \u00a0I've queued for up to an hour for this place but it's worth it. \u00a0Pizzas are circa \u00a35-6 and big. \u00a0They also do gluten free dough for those into that. Great casual dining, inexpensive, and good food gives them 5 stars for me!",

In nice weather, it's a great place to sit outside and people watch. I've never been on a day other than Sunday, but I assume it's still a good place to go, and much quieter. The pizzas are huge and I'm always impressed (and slightly guilty feeling) that I finish it. They offer all the good stuff on the side and the chili oil has a nice kick.",

The garlic pizza bread is really really awesome. It's really all about the texture of the bread. I also ordered some chips and a grilled veggie salad. They also put rosemary chili olive oil on the table to have with your meal. It's nice on anything really.We had sort of doubted the place at first, but we walked away happy and full.",

    "text": "What can be better for a gloomy Thursday night than amazing Italian food in one of the loveliest lane in London. This place has really surprised me. After you make the first step in, you are hit by aromatic scent of spices and garlic (in a positive way:)). The place is small but cozy, nothing fancy, but when I enter a colourful place, I can't help liking it instantly. It wasn't only the biggest calzone I've ever seen, it was also the most tasty I ever tried! And believe me, almost ending up as an Italian sposa once, I'm quite demanding, when comes to Italian cuisine. Unfortunately for me, I had to satisfy myself with just a few bites from my boyfriend, as I ordered mushroom pizza, which was also pretty good, but the vegetarian calzone (with sun fried tomatoes, olives, peppers, looooots of garlic) was a masterpiece! Cheese monster like me should be pleased as well as it's packed with mozzarella. And all this for just \u00a35-6! The service was extra fast (we got our food in less than 9 minutes although the place was quite packed). Better book your table in advance, especially on weekends. They also have pasta and salads on the menu, good selection of alcohols, on average prices, but don't worry, you can find some good cheap cocktails (\u00a34!) among them to match your pizza. I also recommend trying their chilly and herbs olive oil. If you need, they also have wi-fi. The only flaw was the fact that they charge \u00a31 for payments by credit or debit cards without telling you about it. It's not a big deal, but I think we should have been informed.",

I'd been hearing the raves about Stingray for awhile and was keen to check it out when a buddy suggested we swing by. Honestly, I wasn't blown away but really pleased and would love to visit again. I had the Boscaiola (tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms, bacon and onion) which for 5.95 was tasty, filling and affordable. The pizzas at Stingray aren't the best in London but they're certainly more than adequate and very good value for money. Throw in some decently priced Peronis, a working fireplace, a very friendly (and cute!) wait staff and a cozy vibe great for catching up with an old mate and you've got a quality little eatery. As popular as this Columbia Road mainstay is, reservations are definitely the way to go.",
