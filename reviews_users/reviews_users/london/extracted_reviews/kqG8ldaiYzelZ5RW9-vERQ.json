Highly recommend the XO shrimp dumpling and the scallop dumpling. This place was decorated with modern interior and dimmed lighting. There are 3 levels to this place and we were seated in one of the booths on the ground level. Service was excellent. Give it a try if you are in the area - definitely worth it!",

    "text": "Plum Valley's dark interior is better suited for a romantic dinner than a lunch out or a place to go with children. But there are plenty of other places around here that fill that quotient so it's a nice addition to the usual chinatown fare. I only ordered the dim sum, so can only speak to it, the wasabi prawn dumplings were good kind of fooled myself into thinking I was eating sushi with that wasabi. \u00a0The scallop cheung fun was probably my fav dish (and their scallop dumplings) and delicious. \u00a0Bread cheung fun and prawn cheung fun were both yummy but are dishes to share, don't know why cheung fun is both so tasty and so heavy that it makes it almost impossible to finish one yourself! So basically, if you are looking for an evening spot that's a bit more trendy/posh than you can find usually on Gerrard St., I'd recommend it. Think you might be giving up a bit on food quality for ambience, but don't get me wrong the dim sum was still yummy, just short of down right delicious though. \u00a0I've had more delicious dim sum in china town at a place whose decor could be said to be non-existent to run-down so really I think sometimes you are the luckiest to find a place with both great foot and great ambience and sometimes you have to go on your mode and pick one or the other! You decide!",

Definitely worth it, as the main I chose (their signature cod in honey and champagne marinade) cost a whopping \u00a330 on its own!! Lovely service, delicious food, well presented. The place is a bit dark and intimate, which is fine if you're on a date but perhaps less fine if you want a loud and chattery girlie dinner.

    "text": "For dim sum, I think this place deserves a 3.5 (only because we think Royal China and Royal China Club are 4+, and it would be unfair to place Plum Valley at the same level). For main menu lunch/dinner, then this place deserves 3 stars. The decor is an oasis of calm and relaxation in the midst of bustling Gerrard Street in Chinatown. However, the toilets are cramped -- must one weigh no more than a supermodel to comfortably fit? The service is mixed, and can vary from bordeline rude to reasonably friendly. Steer clear of the goose foie gras dumplings (sounds good? doesn't deliver) and the lychee martinis. Make that the cocktails generally, as the cacophany of tastes can only result in acid reflux. The dim sum is good and worth a visit, but this place is certainly not the best or most authentic available. What is does offer is a clean and calm Chinese restaurant in an otherwise hectic and often less-than-sanitary neighbourhood.",

There is a trend for \"haute cuisine\" dim sum which started in Hong Kong years ago and this place exemplifies how beautiful a simple modern steamed dumpling can taste and look. Service was simply great with some of the nicest Chinese ladies I've come across so far in London, and the ambience was pretty contemporary Asian bistro. Watch out for some of the seats as the walkway to the tables slope upwards and one can get caught out a little. Overall, if one loves dim sum and not crazy enough to spend a fortune at Hakkasan, then this is about as good a dim sum restaurant as you will find in London's Chinatown. It's not cheap but it is really splendid value for money.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Recommended for 50% off on toptable and timeout. Plum Valley is a Cantonese fine dining restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Compared to some other restaurants in Chinatown where chickens are hanging in the window and all that awaits you are greasy all you can eat buffets it does indeed set itself apart already from the outside by a very black and sleek exterior. Also inside it's stylish and does not feel like Chinatown at all. I have been trying to eat there for about a year as you can get a 50% off food offer from top table and time out. I tried booking at least 5 times via top table but I never managed to get in for the 50% off. Finally I succeeded booking via time out. Even though the food was nice, a piece of advise: never ever go there without 50% off \u00a0it is massively overpriced. I mean 9.50 for pak choi?? you got to be kidding! We started with Grilled Vegetarian Shanghai Dumplings (5.50) \u00a0ok, but not terribly exciting \u00a0and Mango Duck Breast Salad (9.50) which was served with lemon sauce and pomegranate seeds. The mango was ripe and lovely and the duck moist and tender. All worked together really well and it was quite enjoyable but 9.50?? For the mains we went for healthy options: the above mentioned most expensive Pak Choi of my life was nice but not 10-pounds-nice really. The Chicken in Claypot with Thai Basil and Shaoxing Wine (10.60) was a very generous portion indeed served piping hot. The sauce was nice and spicy and the chicken well cooked. I am using the word nice too much I know.. everything was nice but just not very special. So I would say, with 50% off it's a really good deal especially if you feel like Chinese but want to avoid major greasiness. without the half price, no way! I am kind of wondering if the better idea for Plum Valley would be - instead of having 50% off deals on every possible website \u00a0just to reduce the price?? And there is something else that is not directly related to the food but shows some general lack of organization and concept: Plum Valley does not even have a website",

When she finally returned and finished our order, we hoped things would improve. Half of our appetizers arrived and when we finished with them, we asked about the dumplings and they said they would check on them. Five minutes later they arrived barely warm. 30 minutes after our appetizers were done, we had to ask about our entrees. Two of the four arrived, one was cold. 15 minutes later the third entree arrived without the rice. 10 minutes later the assistant manager shows up with a hot second entree and the rice. At this point, what we had was pretty much finished. 45 minutes after the first entree arrived, we finally got the last entree. During all of this, multiple tables turned over parties and the second parties got their food the same time we did. Even a party of 14 came in after us and left 30 minutes before us. Each time we had to track down the wait staff. If i could give this experience a 0 I would",

So I did the 'no shit Sherlock' thing and headed over to China Town. I was with a fellow veggie and he suggested hitting up Plum Valley. All in all, the food was good and they had more veggie options than most places. They even did a really decent ficken (fake chicken) which had that crispy/chewy texture that I miss. Service was nice, we had a lovely seat by the window and food was good - hence 4 stars.It might not be very authentic, and if that's what you're after, it's worth going elsewhere, but Plum Valley is a pretty safe choice.",

The setting is a bit dark and pretty romantic, if that's what you like. The service was good, aside from some wait time when we wanted to order fresh drinks. A great assortment of food (though with so many options available that it can be overwhelming to actually settle on a dish). Is it a bit pricey? Yes. But it made my vegetarian belly happy (and my partner's meat eating belly as well).",

It's beautiful black front and dimly lit interior screams class and quality. Unfortunately, it's only screams it, there is no delivery.This place sucks. The food is fabulous, if it ever arrives! We ordered some dim sum dishes and some regular Chinese fare. Only half of our order came and when we kept on asking for the remaining dishes, only after the third time were we informed that they didn't have any of it left.As you look at their menu, you'll see a selection of cocktails, nope, none of them are actually worth the \u00a38.50 you'll fork over for them. You'll also see a pretty piss poor selection of wine. Oh dear oh dear, what are you doing Plum Valley? Making your prices bigger won't impress us at all.",

Plum Valley looked like the safer option with both crispy duck and chicken in black bean on the menu. The duck was as good as you'd get in any Chinese restaurant. The chicken however was quite dry, I think they had reheated it (it definitely wasn't fresh). The starter of mixed appetizers was as you'd expect - breaded, breaded and breaded. It was like an average Chinese takeaway, only double the price.",

Upon entering, the waitress asked if we would like anything to drink and after inspecting the menu for my usual tea which costed \u00a33.80, I asked for tap water. She replied by scoffing and going to another waiting staff and mocking the fact that my group wanted tap water. When our dim sum arrived, the waitress yet again was strikingly rude. She commented in Cantonese that the other people in my group did not know how to speak Cantonese, despite them being of Malaysian and Vietnamese backgrounds. It is bad enough to bad mouth paying customers behind their back, but doing it in their mother-tongue, in front of them is crossing the line. When the waitress realised I had been speaking Cantonese, she began speaking Mandarin to continue mocking us. Onto the food, the ha gau tasted like it was from frozen and the siu mai skin was rough. Compared to other restaurants, the rice rolls seemed empty. The bill came up to \u00a335 for 5 dim sum dishes and a dish of rice. Completely overpriced, below average on the taste and horrible hospitality from the waitress. Please AVOID.",

We wanted to get the egg tarts but unfortunately they were out. For drinks we ordered the blossoming tea, which was served in a large wine glass. Everything was delicious, my favorite was the har gow, there was large pieces of shrimp and came hot. However if you're looking for that authentic chinatown experience with the dim sum carts, this is not the place. The ambiance is modern with dark lighting like a night club. The service is very quick but not very friendly or patient. I would say this is for a more younger crowd, but they definitely have plenty of space to accommodate larger parties.",

Ordering was a bit difficult without the real life dim sum on the carts and the English descriptions in the menu are generic. That being said, the ingredients are high quality which makes the dim sum taste good as well. The crystal prawn dumplings (har gau) have full pieces of shrimp in them and the scallop cheung fun have whole scallops in them as well. We were told that the Shanghai-style pork and crabmeat dumplings were soup dumplings and they looked like them, but they contained no soup broth inside them. The stir fry beef ho fun had slightly tough pieces of beef in it that were too large given the size of the the rest of the ingredients in the dish but the taste was fine. We also ordered broccoli in oyster sauce off the regular menu. I guess the fault lies with us for not clarifying, but be warned this is regular steamed broccoli, not Chinese broccoli like we assumed.",

We were seated within five minutes of our arrival and were taken up stairs to the second floor. It took a while for the waitress to pass by our table and since the service was a little slow we decided to order everything all at once. We ordered the following dim sums, the prawn spring rolls, the steamed prawn dumplings, the prawn and chives dumplings, scallop dumplings, prawn won ton soup, fried octopus balls, steamed sponge cake, steamed custard buns, seafood fried rice, and Mongolian beef. The first dish to arrive was the prawn won ton soup which was very tasty and with the super cold weather it helped us warm up. All three steamed dumplings were very fresh with a good portion of prawns or scallop stuffed inside. The fried octopus ball and prawn spring rolls was amazing, crispy on the outside and tender morsels of octopus and prawn in the inside. The main entree were the seafood fried rice and Mongolian beef, the fried rice was pretty small and low on eggs, while Mongolian beef was tender and little bit too spicy. For Dessert we ordered the sponge cake and the sweet custard bun, the sponge cake was a light moist cake not too sweet. The sweet buns was the complete opposite, with a egg based sweet custard, but it was super good. The food was very good but the service reminded slow and the waitress were not the warmest part of our meal.",

From the start they seemed a bit disoriented and weren't very attentive especially when we asked to be moved away from the door ( in the middle of the winter). If that's not enough it seemed as if they tried to hide the lunch special menu from us until we asked for it (we had seen it online).

The interior is more sleek - booths with black leather seats and dimmer lighting - making it feel a lot more swanky even though prices are only a tad bit higher than other places. Food is also always spot on. Their dim sum menu is extensive including many classic dishes but also more unique ones like the goose foie gras siew long dumpling for example - yum! Their cheong fun is also consistently very good as they don't scrimp on their fillings. I have been here several times now, tried different things and have enjoyed it each time so you really can't go wrong with your choices. One of the top places in Chinatown for me. Does get crowded on weekends which can slow down the service.",

I cam here on a recommendation from a guy who works for the UK Foreign service who told me this is one of the best places for Dim Sum in particular. I am so glad that I met him, because the dim sum here is fantastic. There is a great selection, it all tastes fresh and good quality and its really well priced (Eat your heart out Ping Pong)!It was just such a consistent place, and you can tell that because the two core dim sum, Siu Mai and Har Gau, were the best I had in London for some time. If you just have a craving for dim sum, dont want to pay too much and just want to get something decent, with big portions, this is the place",

Such unpalatable plates with poor customer service.We were STILL eating the food and the servers were asking us more than 5 times if we were still eating. (Felt a pressure to leave the place) Very very unpleasant experience with tasteless food.",

They give the wrong order of the food, why the fxxk dessert came first?We order bubble tea and came just milk tea we say to them they just say: we don't have topping anymore.Why didn't ask us first? Rice are cold, dishes are very not tasty, dim sum are okThis is my first time writing review on Yelp and I will definitely not recommend this restaurant.",

So I am taking that as a seal of approval for the standard of the food.I think the food is very good and we have been a number of times and have never been disappointed with the food.",

    "text": "Just went there for our Chinese New Year meal. We arrived 30 mins early just to be sure we got our table. Told the receptionist our name, she said the number of people on their record wasn't as many. We told her that we increased the amount of people and called twice during the week \u00a0to make sure and everything was ok (Which they said was ok on the phone). All she said was, \"Nobody bother to update the record...\". She looked frustrated (And so did we). Then another staff came, the receptionist told her the story about no one updated the book. Then pulled a face and off to do whatever she was doing. We were shocked by her attitude and said to the other staff and she said customers had been complaining about this particular receptionist regarding her attitude. Receptionist came back, said she would fix it. We waited and \"luckily\" another big group cancelled their booking, so we got our table. She apologised and we hoped she realised her bad attitude.We ordered our food about 7:30pm. We waited quite a long time and nearly an hour later the soups came. The portion was small for that price, but most importantly, it was in room temperature. Some ordered hot & sour soup, some ordered West Lake beef broth. However, the beef broth tasted like hot & sour soup with a bit of beef. No one was impressed with the hardly warm enough soup. Shortly after one appetizer arrived (Yes, one). Again, it was slightly warm, we were not happy about it and we had no idea why only one little dish arrived. We waited and waited and waited, it was already gone past 9pm. No food still. Talked to the manager and she gave us the typical answer, \"Sorry, we are very busy.\" After that, a junior staff (who looked like 12 years old), came and told us they had no more Peking Duck. Oh great! Told us 2 hours after we placed our order.We requested to talk to the manager again, and then, as you might guessed, \"We are very busy today.\" Look, Plum Valley has been in business for years, how many CNY they've been through. They should have known better. Then the manager said the kitchen messed up our order, they put our order on the last (somehow), blah blah... Not impressed!The thing was, from the receptionist to the serving staff, they just kept blaming others. We were not interested in hearing the inside stories. Plum Valley was supposed to be the more upscale contemporary Chinese restaurant. Service didn't meet the standard. After all the complains, the food came. Again, some of them were slightly warm, I still couldn't believe we paid that much for such food. Some other dishes were hot and some tasted good. But then we couldn't tell if it was because we were too hungry or the food actually tasted good... The table next to us said that some dishes they ordered were not available and the manager said would gave them dessert to make up for it. They waited and waited and at the end, the manager told them they ran out of dessert. So, no dessert for them.It was such a lovely way to celebrate CNY. Yaay!",

Had dim sum for lunch, though, and thought it was great. The dim sum had much deeper and more complex flavors and was not at all greasy. Among the dim sum that we loved were venison dumplings (prepared like pot stickers), pork bao (bun), spring rolls, shrimp wasabi dumplings (great combination of flavors), and fried pork pastry. Everything was great and a little different.",
