Tucked away in Broadway Market you can snuggle up in one of the many nooks or crannies or just grab a big table and get all your mates crowded round whilst you tuck in to some seriously tasty grub, the burgers are to die for and it's worth the trip from Manchester for a Sunday roast alone; all washed down with one of the many Belgian beers on offer. My only critisism is that there isn't a Dove in Manchester but it gains me plenty of points when I can take my mates from home to my best kept secret!",

They have a good range of wines and beers (particularly if you like your Belgian beers like me) and a great menu.

The downside to this, of course, is that any time you try somewhere new you risk stumbling into a bikers' den, a brothel, or even one of those horrible laminate floor and chrome bar gastro-pubs. Which is why it's always such a pleasant surprise when somewhere like The Dove turns up. It's an intimate little pub in Bethnal Green with an interesting interior, all old wood, odd table decorations and creaking floors. They serve a great line in foreign beers, and have a tempting and wallet-pleasing menu to fill in any remaining gaps in your stomach.",

Another thing irksome is that they recently started charging 50p on top of the overpriced food and drinks if you pay with a card, stating that if you went to any of the cash points at the shops on this street they'd charge you \u00a32 to get money out. Despite this contempt for it's customers i'm still giving the Dove 3 stars as the food is so tasty and the selection of many unusual and rare beers is second to none other that i know of in the area, plus there's always a buzz outside on the street, all those young beautiful media types. Just avoid the champagne beer! it sounds good but it's horrid! And costs about 6 quid for a small glass! If in doubt ask the bar staff - one thing they ARE good at is recommending weird lagers.",

The beer choice is probably the best that I've seen in London, with delicous Belgian beers alongside ales, lagers and stout. The design of the place is also nice with the traditional wooden interior and its charming, tucked-away nooks and crannies. There is also a selection of board games, a comprehensive menu and some very modern-looking unisex and surprisingly dim toilets. What can I criticise it for? Well, its definitely too full whenever I seem to visit, and getting a table can be tough. The food could be cheaper too, as its solidly reliable but nothing special.

Who could resist the siren call of orange scented trappist ales, Belgian beers you sound stupid trying to pronounce and a warm candlelit polished teak interior that has just the right level of the 'romance factor' to meet up with someone you fancy for a first date, while simultaneously not being too schmaltzy (which would of course send said date running for the hills)? Not me. That's why on my cycle route home my bike always seems to (ahem) 'break down' (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it!) outside that pub. Then I see the Fruli I say to myself: Sorry, I have no willpower. I must enter. The possibility of me going teetotal is nil, thanks to that place. What I like about it most though is the feel you get when you go in; it's inviting and relaxed, with its gaudy old golden chandeliers and candles stood up in wax-coated bottles, it does have a whiff of the cool about it but it's friendly; without being crammed with tryhards like the Crown at the top of the road. This means that when you trip over someone's bag, accidentally bump someone or ask someone to move their seat in (the place is almost always crammed like a Monday morning on the tube) people still do so gladly, unlike in some other places (mentioning no names, George and Dragon Shoreditch) where you get given the 'hairy eyeball' every five seconds. The beer range is nearly exemplary. It's not as wide as say De Hems in Soho, but still very respectable. Expect to snag some rare ales, honeyed beers, tropically flavoured wheat beers and frequent guest beers that make you seriously consider finding ways to get that drink on tap. At home.",

The mini size benches at the front are good for people watching if you enjoy the bustle of Broadway market under your nose, and inside has a kind of Gallic cavern cafe feel to it, with oodles of atmosphere.

The managing staff/owners are surly and that can be off putting. The female manager/owner was rather curt when we rocked up asking for a table for six. I felt she was doing us a favour by allowing us to patronise her establishment. The male manager/owner practically frisbeed the plates to our table with a very good scowl. But, we really didn't care. The place had a nice vibe, we needed something to eat, and although we requested no chips with the burgers that most of us ordered, when the dish was served, it had chips. When we pointed this out, the waitress (a katoy from Chiang Rai, who, on first impression, seemed standoffish and cold, but turned out to be very sweet and friendly once we were friendly to her) said she hadn't charged us for them. So, good stuff! And as everyone has pointed out, there is a huge selection of Belgian beers, ales and lambics. This is a sister venue to The Dovetail in Clerkenwell.",

Prices are quite reasonable with two pints and a glass of wine coming in at just a touch over \u00a311. The pub itself is quite winding with several levels and tables stacked in a chaotic yet somehow orderly fashion. The benefit of this system is readily apparent when you finally discover a table and realise its quite easy to have a conversation despite the pub being packed. Which brings up another point, this place was full on a Tuesday night and not a banker (myself excluded) in sight. Sounds like a win.",

    "text": "I sort of don't want to write a review about the Dove Freehouse on Broadway Market, because then more people might know about it and it'll get even harder to get a seat at the weekends. Selfish, I know. The Dove is a local favourite situated on Broadway Market in Hackney. In the summer, it spills out into the street and on a Saturday you'll get some of the best people watching in London standing outside and watching the hipsters go by. They are famous for their range of Belgian Beers - particularly their Strawberry beer which is so strong they only sell it in half pints! But since I'm not a beer drinker, I love them for their Bloody Mary's which are EPIC. They come in a pint glass and are actually the best I've ever tried, ever (see pic). They make them with port, horseradish and a secret ingredient (I can't tell you, or I'd have to kill you). On a Sunday, the roasts at the Dove are to die for. Order a whole chicken for \u00a320 to share between two of you and grab a board game from the vast and random selection they have available. It's the perfect way to spend a winter sunday. Be warned though. Get there before 2pm or you'll be waiting queuing for a seat. I'll be the smug one in the corner who got there early.",

It does look like a regular boring pub, one that you could be tempted to keep walking past in the hunt for something a bit cooler. But you'd be wrong. Inside is a split level drinking-come-eating hole with a great range of belgian and continental beers on tap, as well as the regular tipples. It's a big old place yet there were no tables available on a Thursday night at 8pm. Everyone was nattering away or eating or just unwinding. This is somewhere you can get over yourself and just have a beer.I'm going to get back here when it's warmer and fight for some the outside seating (which was also in heavy demand, in February).Nice spot.",

    "text": "The Dove Freehouse and Kitchen is my favourite pub in all of Hackney. There are a number of reasons for this, all of which I am excited to write about. Firstly, the Dove is the epitome of the 'cosy' English pub. Its minimal lighting from scattered candles, its fully functioning fire place, its wide variety of board games and its beautifully crafted furniture all contribute to what makes it an ideal winter venue.Secondly, The Dove prides itself on its selection of Belgium beers, which really is quite impressive. There is a menu that provides information about the wide range of beers. My tastes definitely lie on the fruity end of the beer spectrum and I would recommend the Fruli on tap.Thirdly, given the cosy nature of the pub, it is a great place to come for a Sunday roast. They roast is amazing but you have to be quick, the last time I went there was none left by 6pm. That was not the end of the world however, as I ended having the 'wild boar burger'. The Burgers are huge, utterly delicious and good value for under ten pounds.The forth and final reason for this pub being my favourite in Hackney, is the fact that it has the best Guinness around. Yes, a really exceptional Guinness can be hard to find, but they do it here.The Dove is open 7 days a week and is quite busy most evenings. A lot of the time it can be hard to get a table, but be patient and one always turns up.",

It was ok and I enjoyed it but its something that I could do better myself at home. It didn't seem that busy yet the staff looked quite flustered.

Not only does it have the beer selection from heaven, it serves up a mighty feast too. The ambiance can best be described as enchanting, with four different sections to the building. The main bar space has has room to seat about thirty people, with a little alcove for those romantic discussions. Behind the bar is the restaurant and the downstairs combines eaters and drinkers. In a word, the place is lovely! The wooden beams and lit candles add a warmth that the sterile chain bars could learn from. The staff know their stuff and clearly receive good training.

Three big pieces are served over a bed of chips, with a side of smashed minted peas and tartar sauce.

The nori definitely gave the \"fish\" an interesting flavor.The menu here has a few other vegetarian options, as well as non-veg if you're into that. It's pretty big, but when I came here, almost everyone was just drinking rather than eating. The dining area is separate, with very friendly and attentive servers.

But all I know is I kept ordering those croquettes over and over and my travel companions... always tried to sneak one or two and I think that says it all.There is something special about being a \"foody\" when you choose an awesome food and everyone else is jealous of what you ordered and are less enthralled with what they bought... you get a little cocky. The brew and drinks here were all delicious, my friend enjoyed here fish and chips... but I am not a fish guy so I can neither confirm nor deny their delightfulness. And that pea stuff... nope not for me.THE VERDICT:I was hungry and you fed. I was naked and... wait no I was not naked. At least not to my knowledge. The croquettes are all I can really speak to here and my entire review rides on them and nothing else. Personally... I do not have a problem with that. And if you do... I really do not care... but I love you.",

    "text": "One of my favourite pubs in London. I came here for the vegan food which is reliably good, especially the Sunday roast. But the beer selection is fantastic. They have a wide range on tap but way more in bottles. You can get lost trying all kinds of Belgian beers, they even have some good gueuzes if you want to try something crazier than a lambic. The location is great, it's just off the canal so you can go for a nice walk all the way from Angel and pop up on Broadway Market. London Fields is nearby as well. Their sister pub the Dovetail in Clerkenwell is good too but more of a weekday place, the Dove is great on weekends but it can get busy. If you have a group I would call ahead and book a table especially on Sundays if you want food.",

    "text": "If you are near Broadway Market then make sure you pop in! We most recently went to The Dove on Sunday evening after going for a walk. It was ideally located at the mid-point of our walk so we decided it would be rude to not stop off for a beer especially as they always have at least two gluten-free beers available at any given time. I tried the gluten-free Buckwheat beer which I'm reliably informed has the taste of a white beer! We sat by the door chatting about the week ahead and I have to say it was a perfect end to the weekend.I have eaten at The Dove too and have to commend them for the fact that their food menu is not only excellent but easy to navigate if you are gluten-free or vegetarian. There are plenty of options and they often do dishes with a Thai influence which are also delicious. The staff are very knowledgeable about allergens and cross contamination which made the dining experience that much more enjoyable for myself and my boyfriend as we knew we were in good hands.",

They've got a fantastic selection of Belgian draught beers, and decent noms. The menu straddles the divide between Thai and Italian, and while nothing is epic, it's all pretty satisfying.If it rains on a market day, prepare for every seat to disappear in minutes!",

    "text": "Following a Saturday afternoon trip out to Broadway market, my girlfriend, her sister & I dipped into The Dove. This was largely based on the possibility that I could enjoy a vegan meal with my two meat-eating cohorts.Initially, as advertised outside the pub, I wanted to order their beetroot & blackbean burger that was vegan friendly. However, upon ordering I was told it came WITHOUT a bun (as the bun was brioche) and there was no bun to replace it- so, in my eyes, this isn't a \"vegan burger\", right? No \"vegan burger\" for me then.Instead, I was on the spot and only had one option remaining - Quinoa chilli. So that's what I had. The girls had chicken pad thai. The food that came was nice enough- nice vegetables, good portions, good flavour.Nothing special, nothing fancy & unable to have what I initially intended to go in for- a simple vegan burger. The pub has a really nice interior, buzzing with locals and a great atmosphere. Good beers on tap too. I would come back for drinks, but not for food. The Yelp two star rating sums it up - \"Meh. I've experienced better\".",

Other places on Broadway market take music, loud groups while The Dove Freehouse seems to just love all things that are great to do with beer. You can talk, have a great drink and some lovely food in an unpretentious relaxing vibe. The dining room is relaxed and the staff very friendly. My only gripe is that it is sometimes hard to get somewhere to sit down. On the street is always an option and gives you a chance to watch the strange, odd and sometimes beauitful people go by.I would recommend The Dove Freehouse for a medium size of friends who want to enjoy a chilled out weekend meal",

The Dove is wonderful, a really charming find smack bang in the middle of Broadway Market. Jumped in here on a Sunday evening and were greeted with a comforting smell of roast meats and a lovely live jazz trio playing some great tunes. The bar is very well stocked, plenty of beers and some really unique finds that I've yet to see anywhere else. The Cherry Beer was certainly a favourite! Although we ate elsewhere, the passing food looked excellent, very healthy portion sizes that made us instantly regret our decision not to dine.We ended up spending most of the evening here and this is a credit to the staff, all more than helpful and really friendly. They've got an excellent selection of board games and to be honest what's better for a sunday than a few pints and a cluedo challenge, love it. Certainly planning to go back next weekend, the food menu is mine!",

Two brilliant things to do when you have great beers.Being Belgian myself, a place like this is heaven for me. We've been twice already. Last summer on a Saturday when the market was on. This is a perfect opportunity to try out lots of different things and foods on the street and take a break in the sun with a good beer on their outdoor space.The second time was when we were doing a walk along the canal not that long ago. Broadway market is the perfect location to take a break in between the walking and go for a drink. The Dove Freehouse is almost next to the canal.Their selection of beers is truly amazing and a lot more than the average bar in Belgium. I always try the ones I definitely can't find somewhere else or in the supermarkets. One tinny snobbish comment: my second beer wasn't served in the right glass last time. I know, sound absolutely ridiculous, but we Belgians are quite fond on that! ;)",

I'm not talking about my living room here I'm talking about the pubs in the village where my parents live. I've live around here for about 3 months now and this is the first time I've actually been in this pub. I've had a pint outside, but not eaten in. I feel so luck to have such a gem on my doorstep. Live music, a huge selection of real ales, ciders and beers, as well as fruit beers, a wonderful selection of home made foods, friendly service and cosy seats make this a prime pub for whiling away the cold winter evenings.
