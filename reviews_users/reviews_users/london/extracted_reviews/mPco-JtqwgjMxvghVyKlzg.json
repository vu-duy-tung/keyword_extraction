Not quite as upper end as e.g. Barrafina, but relatively good value. However, I want to shake the waiting staff by the neck, because the service is below par. One of the guys has serious attitude, and there's just a generally slow languid feel about proceedings, e.g. the bar has always been overflowing with dirty glasses, while the waiting staff chat near the hatch. It's a waiting no-no, and things like this really peeve me \u00a0no idle time, and lots of regular eye contact around the dining room, please! It's not hard",

We got a tasty bottle of wine and ordered two plates of the baby squid, two of the grilled artichoke, one special rice dish and an amazing grilled lamb dish. Every single bite was perfection! It was a symphony of groans and sighs throughout the meal. As a general rule, my friends and I usually spend forever getting through a meal because we talk so much but last night we silently savored every little morsel, and then we chatted away over boozy coffees to finish off the meal. I really can't say it enough- El Parador is a brilliant spot and well worth the journey from whatever part of town you call home. It's perfect for a date or for a night with friends. It's fairly small and not the ideal place for a really large group, but rather for a more intimate night out. And the icing on the cake? It's very well priced!Please please give this place a try!",

Largely due to Koko's being right there. But this was my first attempt at going to El Parador. We didn't make a reservation, but were able to be accommodated in a matter of minutes, which was great. They have a good selection of Beef, Chicken, Lamb, \u00a0Veggies & Seafood. Although due to lack of desire and potential of death respectively, I abstained from the last two. However, the winner of the night clearly was the SALTEADO de SOLOMILLO; which is fillet steak marinated w/ thyme, garlic & cracked blk pepper with caramelised leeks, butter & Ruby Port. OH EMM GEE, delicious! Followed not too far behind was the ALBONDIGAS or pork meatballs. The pricing is incredibly reasonable, the food and service is exceptional, and the overall vibe and proximity to nightlife is great! I highly recommend this place and will hopefully return there soon.",

We had scallops, octopus and squid as well as some salad and some duck goujons. The duck was pleasant but I really found myself lusting more over the seafood. Everything was cooked beautifully and had a really lovely balance of sweet, smoky and spicy seasoning as well as big punchy flavors. I don't feel that visiting once has done the place justice and this is my new top place for tapas. I will definitely be going though when it is 3 for 2 for greed rather than thrift.",

Back around then I worked around the corner at Greater London House and this was a favourite lunch time haunt. Many, many \"business\" lunches were conducted here.The staff are friendly and will always suggest their favourite specials. My Alioli made at home is based on their recipe they taught me one afternoon. Addictive stuff!I highly recommend their Gambas Salteada, and Rosario Chorizon both superbly cooked, and excellent when accompanied \u00a0by their Patatas Harra.The Boquerones are sinful and I make no apologies that I could eat these all afternoon. Lastly the Tortilla Espanola (Spanish Omelet) is a must.Thanks El Parador for all those years of enjoyable dishes, I miss you greatly and always try to drop in on my trips to London. If Yelp was going back then I would have around 200 check-ins :-)",

Since my work is about 3 minutes away, El Parador is a popular lunch spot, especially for Team lunches. 6 of us recently went for a birthday lunch and I have to admit, I was surprised. The portions were generous (meaning I didn't have to get elbows out), as well as tasting pretty damn good. We even ordered two portions of fried calamari, it was so good! Favourites were pork belly (really filling, totally fatty, but melts in your mouth), spanish omelette was chunky and filling, a very delicate seabass, succulent pimiento peppers and the chorizo - salty, strong and delicious. Between 6 of us, we ordered 12 dishes and took advantage of the 3 for 2 lunch deal. My one concern was that we were placed underground, in a room that was dark and freezing. This meant we sometimes felt neglected by the staff and missed out on the general buzz in the area. However, if there \u00a0had been more people dining downstairs, there would have been no problem whatsoever.",

    "text": "Came here after having a few drinks in Camden and searching on Yelp / Time Out for somewhere to grab a late meal. As promised, it offered straightforward service and good no-nonsense food that helped satisfy slightly a couple of slightly drunk people overdue a meal. The portobello mushrooms were well cooked so that they were tender and meaty without going soggy as they can do if they're over done. They had a dark, rich tasting mushroom juice that was soaked up by the great addition of scattered pine nuts which contributed texture and heartiness to the dish. The pork belly came as two big coiled strips of meat which was boiled until meltingly tender, the fat and skin adding to the flavour. \u00a0Herbs held between each layer of the coil also gave more interest to the pork, which can sometimes be a bit bland tasting. A scattering of rocket leaves was a nice addition. Meatballs tasted earthy and homemade with a fairly delicate hint of herbs. I would have preferred something a bit stronger tasting and had to keep dipping them in the rich tomato sauce they came in to add flavour. \u00a0Still, they were fairly satisfying. Scallops though nothing fancy, plump and fresh tasted and went well with the slices of black olive that accompanied them. Like all the other dishes except perhaps the meatballs, this was a good sized portion for just over five pounds.This is definitely somewhere I'd return to when I'm next in Camden. I might even forgo the pre-dinner drinks and couple a few of their tapas with a bottle of wine.",

It does feel a bit cramped to be honest, I like to stretch out a fair bit when ordering lots of tapas dishes but the silver lining was that it meant I didn't over-order.

I rated 4 star since one staff of them was not agreeable and less attentive. He forgot our order twice and didn't look sorry.But the food was amazing with reasonable price! It's a more than 10 min walk from Euston station but I would maybe come again : )",

All of the dishes were delicious, but I think \u00a0the ROMANESCO de ALMENDRAS y PIPAS tostadas * was my absolute favorite. \u00a0They also had lamb sausages as a special the night we were there which we loved.",

I have absolutely no idea, then, how such incredible food made it out of the kitchen! We (my son and I) ordered broadly from the menu - artichoke hearts, belly pork, hake, octopus, chicken livers - early on a Sunday evening, and it was easily as good as any tapas I have had anywhere... My previous high water mark was Casa Mono in NYC, but that has declined below El Parador's level.Where the restaurant misses out, perhaps, is in the service - with only one out front, we had to ask for more drinks, water was not offered, etc. But that is reflected in the bill - \u00a375 between us, considering we'd gorged, was good value...",

They also have a really sunny garden, but my friend deemed it too cold to sit out in the sun- next time! We had, ranked from best to mediocre...1. Chorizo- couldn't get enough of the spicy, greasy goodness2. Venison marinated in red wine, topped with beetroot (a daily special that was melt in your mouth tender)3. Grilled artichokes4.

    "text": "Thank you, Yelp app and fellow Yelpers for directing me to this little tapas restaurant on Eversholt Street.It's a little unassuming family run restaurant but with serious intent from the kitchen. I was offered a table in the main dining room or the garden when I walked in - as we are in the middle of 'Wimbledon week showers', I chose to dine indoors.The menu was written in impressively authentic sounding terms but closer inspection revealed some fusion going on - lemongrass, tumeric and enoki mushrooms being amongst the ingredients on show. I'm up for a bit of fusion as long as it doesn't end in con-fusion!Having confirmed that I was hungry, the helpful waiter suggested getting 3 dishes. I couldn't help myself and went for the fusion sounding dishes.Panceta con cidra was pork belly, rolled and marinated with garlic, black pepper and dill, braised in Asturian cider. I zoom in pork belly whenever I see it and this version has been slowly cooked to melting tenderness with the dill coming through strongly - it didn't need the wedge of lemon which came with it and I enjoyed it as it arrived.Pollo a la plancha del Parador were a pair of chicken thighs marinated in lemon grass, turmeric, garlic & coriander and cooked on the plancha (grill). I prefer dark meat as it remains moist and the oriental kick wasn't too overwhelming.When the waiter said the Higadillos Salteados (chicken livers with Iberico Jamon, enoki mushrooms, shallots, black pepper and butter) would be served pink inside, I smiled - nice to see a restaurant willing to serve food as it should be cooked and not pander to squeamish guests. These were a delight and to get some Iberico ham from acorn-fed pigs was a bonus.This is tapas of the highest order, given a little twist. A little Yelp gem which deserves its high star rating.",

    "text": "3 dishes for the price of two tapas. Ingenious. A fat glutton trap. And like the fly to the pitcher plant, I buzz brightly into this place only to leave on my hands and knees begging for mercy and in need of 40,000 winks.Three dishes is easily enough for a normal person when it comes to Tapas. But if your eyes are bigger than your tummy (I have the eyes of a Tarsier) four is safer. And because it's three for two here, you may as well round that up to the six innit? Clever. Evil. Especially when the cooking is this honest and decent. The menu is laden with what I would call earthy, authentic fare. I'm not Spanish so don't quote me on that but with things like octopus and squid stew, pan baked salt cod, chicken livers with char grilled piquillo peppers, fennel hearts with garlic oil and honey and plenty more to choose from AND all in Spanish with the English underneath, that's authentic enough for me.We ordered tiger prawns with confit garlic and roasted courgettes, grilled sardines, calamari, grilled octopus, steak with sumac and garlic, chicken thighs marinated with harissa and oregano, tortilla, the fennel hearts and potatoes with harissa and caramelised leeks.The prawns were nothing to write home about (are they ever unless they are cooked for the briefest of time? These felt like so many other similar dishes where the prawns have become a little too nugget-like) and I prefer my sardine skins burnished and burned. But these two dishes were still perfectly edible and tastily seasoned.Everything else was properly delicious. The sort of tapas that you just can't be polite about and leave the last mouthful to someone else. It's everyone for themselves and I'm taking no prisoners.The highlights were the fennel which had been braised to perfection. Lovely and tender and carrying all the flavours they had been cooked in. And the chicken thigh pieces which were juicy and again had all the flavour of the marinade. This restaurant isn't smart in a shushy or blingy way. It's at the top end of shitty Somerstown before you hit Camden. And the place itself is small and depending on what frame of mind you're in either 'charming and cosy' or 'grotty'. Deffo charming and cosy for me.But you don't come here to be seen. You come here to eat. And the food is hearty, it's packed full of flavour, it's mediterranean to the bone, it has no airs or graces and at three dishes for the price of two it's an absolute steal. The service is charming. It's obvious they love producing this stuff and serving it to appreciative locals who are in the know.Nine dishes, two and a half hungry people, one forklift truck to winch us out. Top place for some great home made Spanish tucker.",
