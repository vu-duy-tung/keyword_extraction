It provides something different compared to the same old boring restaurants you find on the high street. The branches I've been to seem to have the same feel to it; quite homely with a touch of Dutch of course. The menu seems straight forward enough, with the option of customizing your own pancake if you'd like. I personally love the chilli con carne savoury pancake as my main and the traditional poffertjes for dessert. Otherwise, you can just come in for dessert!! P.s. They also do 'Monday madness' aka pancakes for \u00a35!!!",

Just to add, the pancakes are huge, and you have a choice of savoury or sweet. They take great pride in all what they do, the service is fantastic, and really friendly, and if you fancy something else other than a pancake, you have a few salads to choose from as well as other types of traditional Dutch starters and deserts, though I myself have never seen the point of going to a pancake house and getting a salad, they do look quite nice.This place is traditionally Dutch, in its d\u00e9cor and by its menu, the beers include Amstel, Hoegaarden, Grolsch, and a selection of fruit flavoured beers (cranberry, strawberry & passion fruit) made with real fruit.I have only ever been with friends for a nice tasty pancake, but it would be perfect for a day out with the kids to hold a little party etc. Its great in here!",

I just went again with my husband tonight and it was SO good!! I got the asparagus pancake (it had olives, asparagus, cheese, spinach and red onions. The spinach and red onions were fried into the pancake, while the other things were topped on it. It was incredible. My husband got the My Old Dutch pancake. According to him it had chicken, ham, peppers..and he can't remember what else, but he also thought it was fantastic. In fact he thought his was better than mine!The pancakes are GIANT. I wasn't able to finish my asparagus one off, but my husband was more than happy to take care of it. The service is great here. They are super speedy and very pleasant. They also have a loyalty program, if you buy 9 you get one free. So glad this place is just around the corner from our flat!",

Inexpensive and tasty - about 15 different varieties of sweet and savoury choices at My Old Dutch, with an equally large variety of non-pancake dishes and beers for those looking for something different. Be warned, the pannekoeken here more resemble European Crepes than American Pancakes. But even transplanted Yanks will find these massive discs of dough addictive and delicious.

When our crepes arrived, they were HUGE, fortunately they have extra big plates for them. I cannot quite remember what I or my boyfriend ordered but we both said our crepes were... alright. They were fun because they were very generously stuffed, but the taste was nothing out of this world. I think I would have preferred a good crepe and a good sunday roast instead of trying to combine both and coming out with something - alright. We were absolutely stuffed though so we couldn't order a sweet option. But looking at the next table's order the sweet pancakes look amazing!

If you're craving American pancakes, they have a wide variety of sweet options, but make sure you order the BUTTERSCOTCH PANCAKES! These don't taste any different than regular American pancakes but they are nice and fluffy. Their \"SWEET PANCAKES\" and \"SAVORY PANCAKES\" are actually crepes - so if you want crepes, order one of these, they're massive. If you want American pancakes, order the Butterscotch pancakes. I personally always get a Butterscotch stack with chocolate chips and Maple syrup (I don't believe the syrup is real Maple syrup but we can't have it all). These are great if you really need a fix :) A word of advice for people who are confused when you see your crepe (aka sweet or savory pancakes), yes they are laid out flat on the circular plate. Put your fork in the corner of the crepe and roll it. This is the best way to eat these crepes. I recommend for Butterscotch pancakes. I have personally not tried their crepes but they do look amazing! The apple juice is also quite nice :)",

It's cheaper as well. Service-wise it takes ages to get staff attention to order but but food comes pretty quick (once you've spent ages trying to order).The mains aren't too bad but I think in future I'd go for the veggie option as the chicken, salmon or meat always come out salty. At least the veggie option simply tastes like a pizza on a pancake. Overall it's not too bad. It's descent for a sweet desert after a spot of shopping at High St Ken.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for brunch/lunch and stumbled upon My Old Dutch. It was decently full (Sunday noobut we managed to get a table right away. Our waiter was very friendly. I was looking for something savoury so I got the Eggs Florentine, it came with spinach, cheese, red onions and 2 fried eggs. My boyfriend was set on getting something sweet so he got a chocolate one which came with scoops of ice cream and chocolate syrup. These pancakes are HUGE. I laughed as they placed these gigantic plates in front of us. However, the quality was not lost. Mine was delicious. Everything was spread out nice and evenly and I didn't find it dry at all. The boyfriend also gave 2 thumbs up to his. We both couldn't finish ours which is disappointing because I hate wasting food but too much is better than too little! I saw other tables also struggling to finish. Not the cheapest place but not bad, plus you get a huge portion. Would definitely go back here as they have so many options on the menu that I feel like I need to try more!",

My first choice was closed so I stopped in and I'm glad that \u00a0I had.. and waited for a bit.If you're looking for American pancakes or crepes- you can find both here made to order- smaller and larger portions are optional.I usually make my own crepes at home with lemon juice and sugar- rarely would I order a savory crepe since most turn out greasy and or soggy..Lemon and sugar is my to go to crepe- but I wanted to have something different.These guys also offer Gluten Free..I went with the Lite Options end of the menu since it was late and had to still trek home, something I loath on a full stomach.Ordered the Tricolore: Mixed melted cheese with chopped tomato, basil leaf, Feta,mixed herbs and spring onion..I'm not a fan with food being loaded with cheese, but it was very lightly topped ,basil didn't over power the crepe.. light on the ingredients which was just right without feeling guilty of late night eating.Try their Lattes!",

This location is right around the corner from Kensington High Street station making it a fantastic late night stop.Whether you want savoury or sweet, they have a pancake to satisfy your desire. I really enjoyed my four cheese pannekoeken, topped with mozzarella, halloumi (?), cheddar and gouda. Excellent with just a touch of ground black pepper. I was really tempted to have the sweet nutella pannekoeken, but it was dinner time and I also wanted a beer. Sweet with beer just didn't fit my mood.And talking about beers, they have an amazing selection of \"fruit\" beers ranging from black cheery to mango to banana and more. I wasn't quite courageous enough to try one of those, so I had a really good Vedett. Professionally poured from the bottle, it was perfect offset for the cheesy pancake.I can't wait to return and try that Nutella, but they might convince me to have one of the others. Peaches with cream ? Banana, nuts and chocolate cause with ice cream? Oh, the choices!",
