Had shared a decent bottle of rouge Sancerre with him once before on a summers evening on one of the barrels outside when we first started dating and it was great to come back for dinner. Great location next to Borough Market, probably better in the summer months as people spill on to the streets and there is a good drinking yard next door for some drinks first. The fish market atmosphere was great and I think it would be good to get a seat around the bar although are table was good. The service was among the best we've experienced and the food was delicious and good fun if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and get a bit mucky cracking crabs and peeling king prawns, otherwise there are plenty of things on the menu \"ready to eat\" - a pre-requisite really is to like fish though and preferably good wine or Guiness too.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. So what if we're all a little bored of the rustic shabby chic thing? It absolutely works here, with the weather board and tin lamps and vintage lettering and the old barrels and concrete floors and cast iron fixtures. It gets really busy and that bustle is what makes a place like this, along with the extensive and well chosen wine list, the open-plan kitchen with worn-leather bar stools you can sit at and watch the chef blazing at the grill and oven while the commis cracks on beside him, shucking and shelling and blanching and braising. My recommendation is for the gloriously fresh rock oysters with a glass of Picpoul de Pinet, followed by the beef, Guiness and oyster pie accompanied by a glass of hearty Rioja. If your toes aren't curling by then, you've probably been decapitated, which is ironic as that pie is in fact to die for. Bash in to the crust and sample the rich deep flavours of the meat and porter, then place your unctuous oyster delicately inside, where the salty brine will mix to create a heady combination of light and dark. This is comfort food at it's finest. I'm going all out and giving it five because the prices are reasonable and it's entirely consistent. Yet to check out their Soho sister but there's always room for a few more oysters.",

The days of poor people eating oysters plucked out of the Thames mud are well-receded into the distant past. So are the days of people not infrequently dying or getting very, very ill eating bad seafood. Plus, if you read the papers you might know that there is a problem with some of the Mediterranean oyster beds which has resulted in prices being driven up.But if you compare the prices here against other places in London selling high-quality seafood, you won't find them out of line (not too big a surprise, a lot of them are serving seafood they bought from the Wright Brothers wholesale operation). If anything the prices here at the source might be a bit less.I have eaten here at least four times now, and have only once made a reservation. If you are okay to sit at the bar, and don't mind having a time limit on your meal, there are times when you can just drop in. I have always found them staff pleasant, friendly, and at times charming.The oysters are always very fresh and tasty. I've tried some of their cooked oyster specials, and have been quite pleased with those as well. The smoked fish pate is fabulous. Everything is very fresh. The beer selection is interesting, definitely recommend the Hix Oyster Ale.This is one of my personal favorite restaurants in London!",

The seafood is of exceptional quality and cooked to perfection. While the food isn't cheap (although it's perfectly possible to have an inexpensive meal through choosing dishes such as mussels) the drinks menu to accompany is good quality and for London, good value. My favourates includes they're Oysters Rockerfeller, mussels, razor clams & for drinks their very reasonably priced but very drinkable Prosecco. The only reasons I haven't given this 5 stars are: - A more extensive choice of sides would be a bonus as portions aren't huge- Selfish, but I'd love to come here more often. Sadly it's difficult if even one person in the party doesn't eat shellfish as the other options are fairly limited. Nonetheless, it's one of my favourite London restaurants and I look forward to returning in the New Year. Top tip if you're thinking of going - book in advance, because this place is popular.",

The oysters, albeit a bit pricey at \u00a33 apiece, were exceptional (I'd pay the \u00a39 again!).I sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen, so asked one of the chefs for a recommendation from the specials (I assume daily picks from the market), and he recommended the hake. It was perfectly prepared and accompanied by a sauce perfectly matched to the hake (an all-too-rare occurrence) and vegetables that supported the fish well.Dessert options were few, but with little room left, the cheese plate was just perfect.The host was polite and friendly. The wait staff were efficient and engaging, and happy too to help with recommendations. All in all, a standout meal.Price for oysters, fish, one porter, and cheese was \u00a350.",

It was as crowded as it gets - my lunch partner and I sat at the bar and watched the food being prepared. Although all cooked food looked amazing - for over 27C outside we went for the seafood platter (fruits the mer).Buzzing Borough market is nearby so you can pop by before or after you've done your weekly produce shopping on a weekend, or have a long lunch on a Friday afternoon with a cheeky glass of wine as well. I ordered great honey sweet Rose on the menu - cannot remember the name, but I highly recommend asking the waiter for what would go well with that particular dish you're ordering.Dipping the fingers in the platter full of ice and having a competition of who would get the snail out first, was fun. I'm coming back to savour the fish that looked fabulously prepared and discover other gems in their wine list!P.S. Reason for being stingy and not giving 5 out of 5 - is that the crab was really missing from the seafood platter.",

    "text": "Oysters are to me little balls of spit that some very clever business man has managed to market as one of the worlds most expensive delicacies. Every now and then I torture myself by trying one again and I'm immediately reminded at how repulsive they are. If these are my feelings towards oyster's you might be wondering why I visited an oyster house recently. It is an odd pairing I'll admit but being a great fish lover I was hoping they would have something else on the menu that would tempt me. Sadly, I was disappointed. As you might expect oysters are really the star of the show at Wright Brothers Oyster House. They come in a selection of sizes with a selection of accompaniments and pictures of the things adorn the walls. My family quickly tucked in to these beasts and raved about how great they were. Clearly if you like oysters, this is the smart place to come. However, as I stirred my watery and tasteless crab and coconut soup, I couldn't help feeling left out. These patchy standards continued throughout the meal and although everyone enjoyed the beef and oyster pie (even me), the mussels were a bit disappointing. We also found the service a bit snobby. The waiter seemed particularly annoyed when we asked for tap water which did little to make us feel at home. Over the rest of the night we found it quite difficult to catch his eye and I couldn't help but feel like he had more important customers to tend to. The Oyster and Porter House is a great place to visit if you love Oysters and don't mind paying for them. Tables around were audibly excited as plate after plate of oysters went by. However, if like me, you're looking for a bit more variety to your meal Wright Brothers is not a great bet. Prices are high for quality this patchy. Unless I was accompanying a real oyster fanatic, I doubt I'll be back.",

They had tables as well as bar stools, so it's not like everyone drinking would take up table space, and the 'drinking area' was big enough for six people. There was ten people standing in it. And no, no one was eating. Strikes me as a stupid way to run a business. If there's space, you keep people spending money. Unfortunately, we turned and left and spent our money elsewhere.

The Oyster House is a pretty small restaurant just round the back of Borough Market next to a Konditor cake shop. Menus are on blackboards rather than on paper, and there's a whole menu just for the oyster selection. Seating is available towards the front on stools around barrels but the main chunk is on high stools surrounding the bar area, with two other long tables tucked around the corner. I had scallops to start (\u00a39.99) which involves three of them attached to my plate using mashed potato (is that not odd?) grilled and with tomatoes. It was really tasty but seemed to be coated in oil so I'm not sure what it was doing for my calorie count. My companion had oysters which were presented in ice on a large dish on the bar. He says they were good! I had 1/2 grilled lobster for my main (\u00a319.50) which was really nice but didn't involve the hard work lobster normally entails. It seems in cooking they had removed all the meat and then put it back in to make it easier to eat. Our other main course was cod which came with a small bowl of roasted new potatoes. Only salads are available to order as sides so this was an unexpected potato bonus! The total was \u00a370 including two glasses of wine which is pretty expensive. Although I probably wouldn't return, it was a good experience.",

This week, we finally tried Wright Brothers after many nights eyeing the platters of seafood with much envy! The restaurant was fully booked, but they do hold the front tables for walk ups and drinks only. We managed to secure two seats near the front, ordered drinks and after reviewing the nights specials, settled on the potted shrimps starter, something I'd never tried. For me, it was a slightly strange texture and the flavour was a bit lacking, but it was beautifully presented. My main of the calamari with chilli, lime and ginger was a knock out success! Perfect texture, delightfully spicy and tangy, and the accompanying salad was dressed with a lovely lightly sweet dressing. My partner ordered the moules mariniere which were fantastic! The flavour of the broth was expertly infused into the mussels themselves, though the dish certainly could have benefitted from a side of bread or frites to sop up all the delicious sauce. My creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was fantastic- beautifully crisp top and smooth creamy filling. We finished our night with the best espresso martinis I've ever had, and vowed to return again!",

    "text": "For a dining treat, Spitalfields has always represented for me. Androuet, Blixen and La Pietra are a few which has tickled my taste buds. Living and working nearby, it is inevitable that I will have a wander around the market and cater to my food craving by having a snack here. The Wright Brothers was on my list. I follow their instagram feed and love the tantalising food shots and bags of personality their posts have. In fact, I think that more and more, instagram is influencing my decision on where to dine. It isn't always easy or cost effective to book a photographer to boost your website gallery, so instagram helps cut corners in a visual, up to date and effective way. Shots that you took last year still on your food gallery pales in comparison to a quick snap on your smartphone of the special of the day on your instagram feed. I urge restauranteurs to really embrace this way of marketing. Anyway, back to the review. Wright Brothers in Spitalfields is filled with an older, smart serious crowd. It is just important that you know if you have a beard, skinny jeans and are a little more Shoreditch than city. That said, it doesn't really make a difference, as the focus here is the food. We tried it for lunch and although we had not made a reservation, we were squeezed in. One thing I must note is that it was busy, but the waitress, whilst serving a table and acknowledging another guest practically snapping their fingers for attention, nodded our way to let us know she would be with us in a sec. That kind of juggling of roles, reminds me of old school service, when the front of house team really saw this industry as a career route, as opposed to gap fillers/travelling jobs. It puts you at ease and off the bat, let's you know you are in good hands. Once we were seated with menus, we asked about a couple of dishes and she proceeded to blow our minds further by knowing exactly what was in the dish, how it was prepped and presented. We were sold. It was literally a breath of fresh air. I seldom talk about service in restaurants unless it is particularly bad, as most of the time it is just passable and not worth a mention. This was the bar for all future places I go to, to surpass. I am not holding my breath.We went for the express lunch menu which is value for money with 2 courses for \u00a321.00 or 3 courses for \u00a325.00. The portion sizes are not rations, you are actually left full up.For starters I had ortiz achovies, with shaved winter beets and chives. Sam (not me or the one who lives in Essex), had graceburn feta, pomelo and cashew nut salad. The speciality here is seafood, but I just wanted to quickly add that they do steak so meat lovers are not left out. For main course, it was a hefty shrimp filled burger with chips and chipotle mayo for Sam and a morel mushroom & rich wild garlic mushroom tagliatelle. Yes, it rocked. We were well chuffed with our decision to come here as the food was outstanding. During the meal, the service continued to be attentive and on point. Genuine smiles and intention to assist.I highly recommend visiting this one or any of the other locations. They have definitely got things Wright, oops sorry, right!",

    "text": "Having heard good things on this restaurant from other yelpers, I booked a table for Mother's Day. We turned up and were initially not hopeful about our table, the restaurant was packed and there was a line of people trying to get in. To my shame, they were perfectly prepared, and we were soon sitting at a long table next to another party. Our waiter was great, keeping drinks topped up and answering questions on the menu. The menu though, it could be better placed. They provide the main menu on the large wall behind the bar, the oyster menu on the wall above the disabled toilets, and the specials menu above the kitchen. This meant that everyone at my table had a menu in front of them, behind them and to one side. The specials menu also had the fun of being written in a hard to read handwriting, which my parents couldn't quite make out. Cue me and my sister looking at the board, deciphering an item and then turning around to tell them before getting the next one. Not surprisingly, none of us ordered a special... or ordered oysters from the other misplaced menu. Instead we all ordered from the one menu card that had been placed on the table.Shying away from the giant platters of fruit de mer, we opted for starters and mains, fish soup, whitebait, smoked salmon, and x, followed by fish pie, dressed crab and Moules Marinier. The food was good, my crab being a good amount of crab with no bits of shell (not sure how they did it but kudos!), the mayonnaise was on the side to be added, not premixed in, which was a nice touch. Fish pie was good although there were comments that it could have done with an extra flavour/texture as opposed to being purely fish in its creamy sauce under the potato. Mussels were good, but French frite were desired but not on offer. Wine accompanying the meal was good if just a little expensive.Compared to Tapas Brindisa down the road, this wins hands down for me. The food, the service, the atmosphere, all streets ahead.",

When we saw the Grand Plateau (38 pounds) on the menu, we figured it sounded more fun than just getting some oysters, and I highly recommend you do the same and order it. The plateau features all sorts of seafood that we never would of ordered on their own (crazy little cockles and periwinkles) as well as beautifully poached shrimp (head ons for sucking the juice!) and oysters. The plateau came with a lovely mayo, butter, bread, and mignonette assortment so you could have options for either having the shrimp with mayo on bread or dipping the little cockles into the mignonette.Such a fun way to laze around for a few hours and sample the fresh seafood.See attached photo of the plateau and drool.",

This was one of those cases... after looking at the menu and hearing the fish board specials, I thought, ok, this will all be fine. In reality, everything was absolutely amazing in its own right and it was kind of surprising in the best way possible that each dish was well thought-out to be a winner and they haven't filled the menu with easy fluff choices. Do you know what I mean though, you can kind of tell when a chef has their favourites and then they just do some other things to fill some space... We had nearly everything and while I could list and recommend, the menu changes often so I don't want you to get your hopes up about anything in particular. Just get some oysters and some plates of mains to share with some friends and you'll be set. It's on the high-side of reasonable but certainly not inaccessible, you should probably book ahead if you want an actual table but if you're happy to sit at the bar and chat with your server, then see if they have an open seat.",

    "text": "This was a great find today. I must confess that this was not the original choice. After being put on an indefinite wait at neighboring Brindisa, we hungry souls ambled on Stoney Street to chance upon Wright Brothers. Not sure why we never walked into this one, given our almost weekly trip to Borough Market.The limited menu was obviously indicative that we're in for the greatest and the freshest sea finds in Southwark. We weren't surprised when we saw the place packed on a cold Sunday evening.The kitchen is open and makes for a good way to get a sea food lesson or two, just watching the cooks go. This is a serious seafood place, for oysters in particular; so pretty much every other patron looked like they had or were about to write a book on fine seafood. The place was packed with people, who were all staring at the oysters written up on the blackboards.The petit platter of fruit de mer was the highlight with Prawns, clams, mussels and oysters. Alongside was a serving of mayo and red wine vinegar. Perfectly accompanied. Well thought out and tried. Fresh, fresh, fresh!On the menu, there were so many different preparations of oysters. I was in my own little oyster Disneyland. Alas - I do have a limited stomach and wallet, so I went for the Moules Mariniere, which was excellent, again, FRESH (!!!!), albeit slightly overdone on the butter. The crispy battered squid was above average.Ending the meal with the chocolate truffles is not a bad idea. One of us came back hungry; so yes - bad place to go to if you've skipped meals all day and are looking for desperate comfort food. But, other than the slightly challenged level of service, really not much to complain about.",

The table we was given was next to the kitchen and could enjoy seeing the food beeing prepared. Among us we tried many of the different oysters, and also a few of the main courses. All very very very good. Some of us enjoyed the natrual oysters, but my favourite was the oysters dressed with ginger, wasabi and soy sause.I also had the pint of prawns and they where really good.

We both ordered the sea bass that was to be served on shrimp and tarragon risotto. Unfortunately both our dishes were seriously under cooked when we received them. When we pointed this out the restaurant solved the issue very well. They apologized and asked us whether we would like the same dish redone, or whether we wanted to order something else. We decided to wait for another serving. The wait was worth it. When we got new plates the fish was cooked to perfection and they gave both of us an extra piece. The risotto worked really well with the fish as well, so we both left with smiles on our faces.",

They also have a couple of 'dressed' oysters that are really refreshingly yum. They have a special 3pm- 6pm on weekdays where they serve \u00a31 oysters which is worth leaving work early for.

    "text": "The menu is rather sparse, vaguely traditional and choice of oysters include the likes of The Rockefeller, a wasabi/ginger/soy combo (a bit too Pret for me) and a variety of tabascos is on the table. If oysters interest you, great, but there's not a lot of choice of anything else. Hunger panicked me.I had previously been hot-desking with my colleague, so a dinner date preluded by a stroll along the misty Thames prepared us for an inspired pescatarian plate. *Gasps* one of my favourites, The Table was closed! \u00a0My evening, I thought adjourned. But wait! Watson, I cried, in Borough Market there's a cornucopia of choice. Oysters and porter, \u00a0good choice Watson. The Wright Bros. know a thing or two about Oysters, but the weak porter on offer was worse than a wet weekend in 'Whitstable', overwhelmingly worrying while we waited for our waiter to wait on my indecision of what to have on his 3rd squeeze between the packed canteen seating to get to us. As I anxiously scanned the menu for mains, what appeared as a jovial bustling environment on being seated was actually claustrophobically distracting my decision making, full of boorish loud braggarts.The waiter, abated and educated me on oysters (I love to learn about the provenance on my plate, but theres no point in explaining your epiphany on the French-chewable, full of flavour, but out-of-season ones, is there?) We slurped and bit lip-lickingly through a selection of oysters deliciously displayed, served \u00a0with tantalising shallot vinegar; smaller Jersey's were delicate and sweet as described, whilst Devon's were big bold, meaty mineraley morsels. \u00a0 On ordering mains, the waiters enthusiasm became borderline intrusive, perhaps due to the tightly packed seating, I was put off the idea of their Sardines and d'not slyly market me sides after you inform me theres a \u00a025-30 wait mins for a fish pie.Something in between? No! You can cram too many people into a small space, but I will not be cramming extras around the little room I have and if this epic wait for a fish pie means if it is anywhere near overdone; Mary heck will break loose. I began practicing my tirade, in my head. Sorry, I was still \u00a0'Hangry'. The chef's artistic expression of a fish pie prettily piped with fluffy potato, thank Gouda, was not overcooked. But if this was the reason for the wait; if I'd have wanted to see Mondrianic angles I've have gone to the Tate, but with this Po-Tate I was uninspired. Under-seasoned, disappointingly dull and it was a rather immoderately priced dish, at a pound per minute for the wait for it to arrive. Being next to borough market I was also surprised that such a pitiful selection of vegetable sides were available too. I could barely hear myself think about what to have for pudding over the din. I had come around to almost liking this place, but our sweet was forgotten. The waiter just bounded over to take our coffee order. I took my dinner date already sweet enough for coffee and more hot desking elsewhere.  Corporate, stuffy and overpriced.",

    "text": "This is THE SPOT for simple, delicious seafood. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us immediately on a Friday evening. We ordered Japanese dressed oysters, Rockefeller dressed oysters and the full seafood platter (feeds 2 as a meal, 3-4 as a starter). The platters come in smaller and larger sizes, as well.The Rockefeller oysters were dressed with spinach, cheese and breadcrumbs. The toppings masked the oyster flavor. The Japanese oysters were lighter, topped only with ginger, soy sauce and wasabi. It basically tasted like sushi but with a slimey texture. This one definitely retained more of the oyster flavor. Interesting to try, but I'd recommend just sticking with naked seafood.The best part was the platter - and it was HUGE. Seafood usually isn't filling for us but this left us stuffed. The platter came with 6 oysters, a dressed crab, 3 baby lobsters and piles of clams, escargot, mussels, and shrimp. We were sitting at the bar, and the man shucking oysters snuck us 2 more oysters.The oysters were good, but nothing spectacular. My favorites were the baby lobsters, escargot and mussels. The lobster was difficult to open but the meat was so sweet! The mussels were cooked perfectly - not chewey but not too soft. And the escargot was just fun to pick out of the shell and eat. The shrimp was average tasting, tedious and slightly annoying to peel. Clams were very small. The crab, which included the head and legs, were dressed with cheese and chives. It was okay to me but my boyfriend LOVED it. The platter was \u00a364 but definitely worth it considering the amount of seafood you're getting.I want to go back to Wright Brothers but my wallet is telling me \"no.\"",

I've been a few times and it is what I imagine as an ideal oyster house and seafood spot.They present raw oysters beautifully and it tastes delicious with the right amount of brine. The fish pie (5/5) is a unique dish that I found mild but delicious. It has very hefty chunks of fish with a cream/potato top. Best fish pie I've hadGuinness beef and oyster pie (4/5) - hefty and filling. The oysters come raw and then you throw them in the pie to cook briefly. Brilliant! Scottish mackerel fillet on salad (3.5/5) - clean flavor and a refreshing salad. Pretty large portion actually. Not particularly memorable. It was a daily specialPrawns garlic and rockets (5/5) - great special. Wish it came back.Service is very friendly and attentive.",

Wait staff is attentive and Listens to your questions and great suggestions. The face that the meat pie had Teal huge chunks of meat all in it alone gives them props. The crust is flaky and light and the waitress suggested I slip the 2 oysters it came with into the slit at the top. Who knew? The flavor of the pie made it even more succulent and flavorful. Kinda want another one, but \u00a0already bursting....Ps the crispy bay prawns are delish too!",

Main dishes we have fish pie and cold crab with side dish new potato. Fish pie the portion is big but no as tasty as i would expected...with lot of fish bones hidden that make me go to toilet to throw out from my throat. Otherwise i could be choking and ended up in hospital. We skip the dessert as we cant download anymore foods. The bill come to nearly \u00a3100 with 12.5 percent service charge.

I think it a Jersey Rock oyster. It was incredibly salty and mineral, not to my taste, it might be yours. But the waiter didn't even know what it was - I had to find out from the oyster shucker at the bar.Service - had to make a huge effort to flag down the waiting staff every time. They should be scanning the room instead of eyes down all the time. When our crab came, they forgot to bring the hand wash bowls until we asked. Pretty standard service stuff that isn't being done.Confusing pricing - the crab was \u00a319 on the menu. When the bill came, it was \u00a324. When queried, we were told that it costs more if it comes roasted and with a side of chips. We weren't told that at all when ordering, which was very poor service.Food - happy hour oysters were not very good. Even at \u00a31, I think I'd prefer to not have them! The crab was really good though - succulent meat, with a nice butter sauce.Overall, I think I wouldn't go back again. It seems that Wright Brothers is now riding on its reputation, and the London seafood scene is very competitive with very good alternatives.",

They were packed to the gills, but managed to squeeze our party of four in the back by the oyster bar. We ordered an array of appetizers and the fish pie. To start, the fish pie was recommended by our server. He literally said we are known for our fish pie, so we had to get it. It was heavenly. Sort of like a shepherd's pie with three types of fish as the base. We had two types of white fish (firm and buttery) and salmon (silky and rich). The fish was covered with pillowy mashed potatoes and broiled to a Golden brown on top. We also ordered the welks. These by far we a surprise for appearance. I never had welks before and they were by far my personal favorite. I ate the whole bowl. The sea smalls were steamed and served with an aioli. They tasted of the sea! Briny and sweet! We also had the fried kippers and the calamari. Both good, but not extraordinary. I wish I would have just ordered more bowls of the welks :/.",

FYI, There's ONE veggie starter option and ONE non-fish main (which was steak) the rest is straight out of the sea! But as it was our boss's choice of eatery, we were fully expecting a sea food restaurant as he is very passionate about his fish..and his verdict was, I quote, \"superb!\" He had oysters which I sampled and have to say they weren't half bad, sea bream and fried mixed sea food. I had the roasted cod because they'd run out of chilli crab, much to my disappointment. However the cod was a fantastic alternative, I'm suitably stuffed and the staff were loads of fun!
