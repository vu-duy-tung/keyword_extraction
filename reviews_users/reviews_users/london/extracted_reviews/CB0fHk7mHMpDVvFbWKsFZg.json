    "text": "The best thing about this place is the fact that it's quick, followed by the fact it's an absolute steal! Around six quid is all you'll need for a decent dinner, and the drinks are more than reasonable too - far cheaper than you'll find in a bar or even normal restaurant. The downside is that it's popular - REALLY popular - which can mean sometimes you feel like you're on a bit of a gastronomic conveyor belt: line up, sit down, eat food and leave. There's definitely no hanging around to canoodle here, and even an extended conversation is out of the question with the wait staff hovering suggestively once you've paid your bill. The other thing that's lets this place down is the quality of the meat, which can sometimes leave its dishes a tad chewy. Stick to the fab veggie options if there's any doubt! That being said, you know why you're here (because you're feeling a bit tight and need food NOW!) so it doesn't really matter. Recommended fuss-free place!",

The Lady the owner took the time to guide me through my choice making sure it was not too spicy for my taste. She also explained about the Thai aubergines and their delicate flavor, she then made taste it before I made up my mind. I found this extremely helpful and the curry was divine. The only thing is about the portion I could have eaten a little be more. Overall an extremely nice experience from which I learned something new!",

It's one of those places on Clapham High Street that is really full \u00a0to the brim of customers almost 24/7, 7 days a week, summer or winter. In the summer it's pretty nice to eat outside and have a quick lunch or equally awesome to stop by before a night out with your friends. The atmosphere was great. It's very \"Wagamama\" style in so far as the way the service is - quick and easy - and the way everyone is seated too. This all adds to it's bustle and is a nice place to eat in.I'd say the food, however, was a little disappointing, albeit cheap. The Pepper Tree is by no means disgusting or terrible but I was just disappointed in the lack of taste. I was expecting something pretty outstanding I suppose since the vibe of the place was really energetic and fun but my prawns didn't taste very well cooked and overall, the meal was something I felt I could've done better at home.Having said all this, I don't think I'll go out of my way to go back but it's not the worst of the bunch on Clapham High Street.",

Everyone sits on benches along big wooden tables and service comes with a smile. It's possible you'll have to queue for a seat, but I've never had to wait too long and you can order whilst you're at it. It's not a place for a leisurely meal, as you'll probably feel pressurised by those in wait. It's more of a wagamama-style place: informal atmosphere but good food.",

Somehow, we always end up here, at The Pepper Tree and eat lots of Thai food. I think that is because we love it so.I like The Pepper Tree because the food is cheap. Most main portions are around \u00a34.50 - \u00a35.00. It is a first come, first served place, so you will find yourself queuing, but they move the queue pretty fast. The tables are all communal, and everyone is squished together. This makes it quite noisy, I have to raise my voice when I am talking to my friends here, but it all adds to the fun.Even though the food is cheap and fast, it is good quality. I have had so many good meals here. I would recommend the cod and prawn fishcakes for a starter. The mains are all delicious. I had a perfectly spiced Thai chicken curry laksa last time I was here, and the good old Thai curry's are a safe standby.The drinks are relatively cheap too. I either get a couple of Tiger beers, or a bottle of the house white, which is surprisingly decent. I love that the wine glasses are normal water tumblers. They are not fancy here, but they know how to do good food!",

I felt the food was made for British palates, and not Asians or World Travellers. A tip: Make sure you sit on the side facing the Common and your friend faces the wall (go to any lengths), and you'll have a more pleasant dining experience. Will definitely be back, but only if I'm craving Thai and in the area.",

I would recommend the Pad Thai, it's similar to street food you eat in SE Asia and relatively not far from the price.

Probably the best thing I can say about it (and any restaurant for that matter) is you win over customers by serving consistently good food. Pepper Tree does exactly that. It's always good, always hot, not too expensive (entrees at \u00a34 to \u00a36; starters at a ridiculous \u00a32.50 to \u00a33) and the service is fast and friendly. If you wait more than 15 minutes for an entree, I'd be surprised. The kitchen cranks it out. If it's any sign, the place is always packed - even on Monday's and Tuesday's. It's been owned by the same people for years and they haven't tried to get too big by opening lots of other locations. They've stuck to the basics of good food all the time. It's not some luxurious place (you sit on long benches), but you leave feeling like you just got a great meal for a bargain. Keep it up Pepper Tree! Your packed benches prove people value good food.",

Completely missed this place and walked past it, but I thought it might be a good chance to give my Yelp app control of my fate.The app may has well have shouted 'It's BEHIND YOU' as it directed us 50m away to the easily overlooked Pepper Tree.Seated in a couple of minutes, the style is similar to that Wagamama's- but think smaller, cheaper, and a bit more special. Started off with Dim Sum- delicious, if not a little on the small side. Mimi took on the massaman curry (sadly I've taken on the spelling as opposed to the eating) and I cracked on with one of the specials- spicy barbecue pork. I'm a huge spice fan, and I was NOT disappointed. Beautiful sweet and spicy flavour, sticky rice and salad were a great accompaniment, and a couple of beers to wash it down with (Tiger, if you're interested)I got a bit over excited with the optional dressings and sauces. Basically each spicier than the last! Ended up with a mouth hotter than Satan's undercrackers but still a pleasure nonetheless.Ended up paying \u00a315 each for the whole lot, (inc.) service, which wasn't bad at all!Would go again - Mimi loved her curry too. She's definitely up for going again. Mind you there were quite a lot of attractive guys in the restaurant, so if that's also a factor for you, then great.",

    "text": "It's a simple and popular little Thai joint opposite Clapham Common tube station. Very pared down (almost unfinished) white walls, the long bench seating and communal tables are packed solid most evenings. At 12:30 on a Saturday I shared it with a couple of Clapham happy families and a pair of joggers fresh from the common. Ignoring their uncommonly good Pad Thai, I briefly flirted with the idea of a deep and cheap bowl of Tom Yum soup before settling on the chicken Pepper Tree curry, their spiciest dish, guaranteed to blast away my ills.A side of sweetcorn cakes didn't set my world (or tastebuds) alight. They are fine, nothing more. Slightly overfried and a little too doughy. The treat comes with the Pepper Tree curry, exactly what the doctor ordered. Foolishly skipping the rice, I plough straight into my bowl, nearer a soup than a curry but packed with flavour. Lemongrass, Thai basil and tamarind provide the backup complexity to a punchy peppery heat. Chicken, krachai (a mild ginger-like root used in Thai and Indonesian cooking) and bell peppers cook in the heat with Thai aubergines and green beans retaining their bite and adding texture to the bowl. It's not complex, but boy is it satisfying.",

    "text": "I was at The Pepper Tree on Saturday night with one of my closest London friends. I am not very familiar with Clapham but my friend lives there so he suggested we should go. I loved the straight forward menu. We shared a started (for 2) which was delicious and went on to have a main each with prawns. My friend took a stir fry while I took a green curry. On the menu it said the curry is medium hot but really, it was quite hot so be aware! It was great food though in any case. Please do go here if you're in Clapham and fancy good, Asian food for good prices. We paid around 15 quid each for starter, main, rice and drinks. I think I might come back next time I'm in London!",

Which was good, because we were eating in a hurry!The Pad Thai was good, but in my humble opinion, nothing to write home about. \u00a0I had prawns, which were really good. \u00a0The Pad Thai here is a bit spicier than other places that I've tried. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0I also got to try the laksa, which I thought was better than the Pad Thai. \u00a0Enjoyed my meal (cleaned the plate!) and will be back to try other dishes on the menu, because I think judging on a Pad Thai alone is unfair!",

    "text": "Pepper tree is a small local Thai restaurant at Clapham. My friend has been raving about it for the past month and so I went along with him this Sunday to see what the fuss was all about.We started with vegetable rolls and crispy fried wontons, made of chicken and prawn. The wontons were tasty (as also the sweet and sour sauce that accompanied them). The vegetable rolls were not that good though. The stuffing had more noodles than vegetables and it was oily.For the main course my friend strongly recommended the Penang lamb curry. The dish had quite a lot of meat for less than \u00a36. The taste was good ... but it tilted slightly towards the sweet side. The Massaman Chicken Curry was much more spicy and enjoyable. They serve a variety of Asian beers which are worth a try.Pepper tree has a small dining area with communal seating (like at Wagamama). There is a long table outdoors too. It seemed quite popular ... being almost full even on a sunday night. The food was good and affordable ... a two course dinner with drinks cost us around \u00a315 per person. They also have this fabulous offer of food and cinema for \u00a312. You get a main course with rice and a ticket for the Clapham picture house (which is a couple of minutes walk away) for that price. That would surely make for a pretty good evening for less. I have rarely seen restaurants and theatres jointly selling a deal (though on reflection it seems so obvious that they should) and i hope that its a huge success :)",

I've been there a few times and everything I have tasted has been top-notch. The restaurant is said to be Thai, but it's unlike any other Thai I've had with slightly more interesting flavours and combinations. Don't get me wrong, I like traditional Thai, but it's noce to have something a little different on occasion. It's always packed so be prepared to wait your turn as reservations are not taken. But once you taste the food and see your bill, you'll know it was worth the wait.",

They serve a good range of starters/sides and I like their curries and noodle dishes alike.The seating is canteen style, so you'll get to know your neighbours. Some people aren't so keen on this... but it's quite likely your fellow muncher is going to a be young professional Claphamite who isn't going to bite and probably smells quite nice anyway!It gets really busy in here at times, so be prepared to wait for a few minutes for the next seats. The turnover is quick though, so don't expect a romantic and unrushed meal. You come here to eat and chat... then move on.They do takeaway too so if it's too busy to grab a seat and/or the weather is good, carry your deliciousness over to the common and grab some beers. Happy days.",
