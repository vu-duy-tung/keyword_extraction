Testament to this is the constant massive queue snaking away from it. Crepes are always made fresh so it'll take a while to get served but you will have had the pleasure and anticipation of watching it being made and seeing every ingredient with your own eyes. They are always nicely packed with goodies whether sweet or savoury and the chocolate ones are made with real chocolate of your choice. This is a great spot for a pre-pub stomach liner supper or a mid-shopping lunch, particularly in the summer when you can sit on a bench and eat it outside.",

Asparagus and cheese, ham and cheese, mushrooms and cheese, chocolate and banana, chocolate and creme; there are dozens of types, including choices of chocolate. You can get them wrapped to eat right away, or put in a take-away container. The price is right, the options are great, and the taste is out of this world.

I wondered why but read on, and you'll see why. I believe this place is extremely over rated but most importantly the staff are rude, exceptionally rude, I have never come across \u00a0people who work in \u00a0food stalls ( and they are many in London ), who don't take pride in the food they serve, where do i start ? . We \u00a0were looking to have something \u00a0sweet and savoury, so we could \u00a0both try \u00a0each other cr\u00eapesI ordered the Nutella \u00a0whilst \u00a0she went for the ham and cheese cr\u00eape and both were disappointing all round . The ham and cheese cr\u00eape \u00a0 was not cooked properly and \u00a0had \u00a0processed ham , \u00a0the guy \u00a0in the black shirt the rudest of them all , \u00a0 just threw in \u00a0the processed ham plus the \u00a0cheese and charged \u00a0 a whopping \u00a34.50, \u00a0at this point I was unsure even if should bother ordering my own cr\u00eape having just witnessed that ,(A) the cr\u00eape was not cooked, B) processed ham was used it literally looked like \u00a0it just came from Tesco No Frills Range \u00a0C) the \u00a0attitude of the French guy in the black top. \u00a0 I have enclosed pictures, so be warned before you go there. \u00a0The nutella cr\u00eape was soggy , but what made matters worse, was whilst the cr\u00eape was cooking \u00a0the guy in the black shirt wiped his sweaty forehead with his hand \u00a0then proceed to finishing making the \u00a0cr\u00eape, with the hand he had just used, disgusting or what. I know it is a small stall but general hygiene practice should be in place. \u00a0 And it wasn't \u00a0 as if he was the only one in the stall, there was another \u00a0guy and \u00a0he just stood there. \u00a0Whatever you do, DO NOT \u00a0go there, the food is not great at all, it no longer bewilders me, \u00a0that there were no queues when we went, it clearly evident \u00a0the food is terrible \u00a0and the customer service is equally as horrendous .

The only slightly annoying thing is that they have no seating and therefore you HAVE to get a takeaway. The solution: benches on the other side of road - not too bad. This is probably going to make me sound strange but the little cardboard cones they put their crepes in makes walking and eating very easy. I get so frustrated if I cannot eat my crepe properly because it is dribbling down my hand and into my jacket - sticky annoyance! They have all the regular choices but the lemon juice is from real lemons (and not a plastic bottle) and the nuts can be almonds or brazil nuts - yummy!",

    "text": "Save yourself a trip across the Channel. The crepes at this cute little kiosk in Hampstead Heath are the real deal. In fact, if you consider crepes in France as the real deal, then these Hampstead ones might be even more real and a better deal. Sweet fillings are good, of course, but I always go for the savoury: ham, cheese, mushrooms, garlic... I think it's because the first crepe I ever had (while in Paris on an exchange trip) was savoury.With your crepe(s) in hand, take a stroll around the area. It's really cute: cozy cafes and pastry shops with enticing window displays. From the tube station, walk down the hill, and you'll see the stand. If you don't see it, it's because it's obscured by the long queue of hungry tourists and regulars. You'll see why.",

    "text": "So, this is my first Yelp review in almost two years. I don't even live in London anymore. La Creperie de Hampstead is kind of a really big deal.I lived in Hampstead when I studied abroad at King's College London and King William IV quickly became one of my favorite local pubs. I noticed the long queues for this little crepe stand from the pub windows one day and knew I HAD to eat here.Even though I ADORE Nutella on just about everything (I have been caught, on more than one occasion, eating straight out of Costco-sized jars... without a spoon), I definitely recommend the savory crepes over the sweet ones here - there is something truly magical about the giant pats of butter and generous heapings of cheese that go into every savory crepe that you just have to experience for yourself! I am not ashamed to admit that I still dream about Hampstead crepes sometimes. I loved how the crepes were served in paper cones with tiny forks, and my favorite spot to eat them was on the metal bench in front of Gail's. The bench faced Hampstead Station was the perfect spot for people-watching on Hampstead High Street. Learning how to unravel the perforated paper cones with expertise took a little practice, but I was a pro by the time I had to say goodbye to London and return to California.Honestly, these street crepes were WAY better than any crepe I tried in any Francophone destination I visited while I was abroad - crepes in Paris, Lyon, or Brussels simply could not compare to the perfectly crispy crepe cones coming from this little North London gem.Note: their mushrooms come from a can. People can be very weird about mushrooms (for instance, I personally cannot eat raw mushrooms because the texture reminds me of fleshy human ear lobes and really freaks me out!), so do not order mushrooms as a topping if you cannot handle the canned fungus!",

Its a good swiss cooked with garlic butter! Need I say anymore.Lets continue with the crepe itself, as the batter is the other great half. The crepe is perfectly crispy but holds its form! If you're ever in the area....grab a bite from here.Also if you're feeling something sweet, you should work up to those nutella crepes that taste oh so good!Then talk a little with the workers, who continually speak in french with their co-workers, some parisians, some senegalese. Use your french and they'll continue the conversation with you!",

But its easily eaten while walking around this pleasant neighborhood. watch out towards the end though it gets drippy.It's about \u00a34.50 I think. Can't remember but would gladly pay more for this delight. I know! Just for you I will go back this weekend and find out that price for sure. See how I take care of you yelpers?! So loving.",

Not this place.",

And to be honest the crepes at this place are so good it's tempting. This is a Hampstead institution really, it's been here since the 80's and is known for it's queues on busy days. The deal is you can either have sweet or savoury and within that there are loads of different choices, classics like suzette, ham and cheese, mushrooms, chocolate, banana, nuts, really varied.

The smell is awesome, and the wait builds anticipation for that first bite. As you get closer, you can choose what kind of pancake you want, savoury or sweet. If I fancy a savoury, I will definitely be getting a sweet along with it, as it's a pancake for crying out loud! It's a desert, I always get the sweet. Once you put your order in, you have the pleasure of watching two pancake making maestros, passionately whoop up your treat. It is actually quite educational as I tend to have my eyes glued to what they are doing. I have been going here for years, and each time is as good as the next. For those of you that have been here before, well I am sure that you share my passion. For those of you who have yet to experience the Crepes of Hampstead, well, the next time you are on the Northern line Tube, get off at Hampstead, at the exit turn left, and you will see it across the road, it is a minutes walk away. During the day you may get lucky and not find a queue.It is set in Hampstead, where you can take your pancake for a lovely walk, and stop off at the nearby caf\u00e9's and have a coffee to wash it down.

But stick to basics and it's a taste sensation. If you come at a busy time, waits are often about half an hour, and there's obviously nowhere to sit, though plenty of benches around (or green spaces if you can manage not to eat it immediately). So I wouldn't do it all the time but it's a good treat and definitely worth it if you're new to the area.",

The first time I had a crepe from this stand was back in 2005 & so happy it's still rolling out delicious crepes. The line was a bit long, but honestly it was maybe a 10 min. wait. I'm not much of a savory type of gal, I stick with the classic and it was delicious like I remembered it. I came all the way from Richmond Park to enjoy my crepe. This is a must for Hampstead Heath & crepe fans!",

Being stood in a queue, often a bit chilly outside, jealous of those just about to tuck into the sweet and savoury crepes, waiting patiently alongside mothers equipped with wet wipes and tissues for the messy, sticky delights to be devoured... If you have a sweet tooth like me, you can get white, milk, dark chocolate, with nuts, or maple and bananas, butterscotch cream or the class lemon and sugar. You can even be naughty and have some rum! If you are to have an indulgent snack/lunch you could go for mushrooms, garlic and cheese, even the likes of asparagus, although that's not my fave veg in the world... There are plenty of variations and that is why I am back there a few times a month !..oh yeah, you will need some extra tissues ! Enjoy !",

I was hugely disappointed and I'm really trying to figure out how this shack has so many high ratings. There was no queue when I went and yet the crepes were rushed and soggy rather than crispy. I only had a simple Nutella filling and with the less than generous spread the crepe was falling apart. On top of this the two servers were rude, didn't say hello in return, were busy speaking in french to each other the whole time, asked us to repeat orders ect. I don't expect a song and dance in every place I go to eat, but basic manners would be nice. I wouldn't go to Hampstead just for these crepes and even if I was shopping on the high street I still wouldn't eat these.",

The crepe itself was perfectly cooked; both tender and with a crispy edge. The salted butter added just the slighted hint of saltiness to counter the sweetness of the chocolate. The nuts brought the perfect textural component. Subtle details, but so important. I'm really keen to return for a savoury option: a range of mushroom, spinach, artichoke and asparagus alternatives, for instance. I have my eye on the crepe 'complet' which is ham shoulder, cheese, and an egg all wrapped up. As the menu says: the French riff on the full English breakfast! OUI, OUI.See a queue in Hampstead?

    "text": "So the question here is do you want to have a PARTY in your mouth? ! If so, for all those visiting north London, or going to Hampstead Heath, take a minute to join the line outside this tiny stall that offers only the best pancakes in all of London. \u00a0Yes I said it, all of London. You have the option to chose savoury or sweet, I always go sweet because the pancake itself has this salty zingy flavour, and the perfect combination of sweet and salty explodes in your mouth once you try it. You can also ask them to combine the different chocolate flavours for an additional 50p or so, so you needn't do plain belgian chocolate alone, you can combine it with a bit of nutella or something else on the side depending on what you are in the mood for.",

I usually have a very sweet tooth and go for the dessert over starter 99% of the time, but at this place the savoury options won me over. I had a spinach, garlic, cheese and cream crepe, the crepe itself was really tasty and crisp yet fluffy. As a lover of all things spinachy or garlicky this crepe was perfect. The service is quite blunt, but when you see they are making 4 crepes simultaneously you understand why! Give this place a visit and you really won't regret it!",

We tried the mushrooms garlic ham, the crepe complete (egg, ham, cheese) \u00a0and the Belgian chocolate with banana. \u00a0they were all delicious! \u00a0the Belgian chocolate was amazing. \u00a0it wasn't a syrup it was actually chocolate chips you would use to make fancy hot chocolate. I highly recommend it. \u00a0the staff is really nice and polite and they move fast! \u00a0the total amount for 3 crepes was 16\u00a3.",

The pancakes are cooked expertly on hot plates before they fold all the ingredients into a tasty wedge you take away and guzzle down. The cr\u00eaperistas are fundamentally French; which means they know what they're doing and can be authentically rude. This is a good thing, if they are being friendly or polite it means the quality of cr\u00eape suffers.I can only complain about the lack of galettes, and the size of the queue sometimes, which is just not acceptable when you need your hit of cr\u00eape to sooth the withdrawal symptoms.Cr\u00eapes are generally less than \u00a34 and they only take cash.",

This place is a local institution, as evidenced by the local outrage when the pub tried to evict them. The queue is always long so if you do ever spot a short one jump at the chance. At weekends it can go around the corner, but it is definitely worth the wait. I always swear I'm trying a new one but I always end up with banana & milk chocolate. Yum!More recent claim to fame was a visit from Ashton & Mila when they were filming here :)",

I went there at 11pm on a dark weeknight, in the pouring rain, and there was still a long line for a crepe haha. I understand the devotion though, because this is a crepe institution, with it's delightful French staff who certainly know what they're doing.I have tried the savory crepe, which was decent, but my heart belongs to the chocolatey goodness of their dessert crepes. I can't even choose which is best, they have all been good. The yummy nutella, belgian dark, milk and white chocolate, bananas, hazelnuts, butterscotch, every combination I've tried has been delicious! Which reminds me, I need to go back, I haven't tried the white with milk chocolate combination yet....:)",
