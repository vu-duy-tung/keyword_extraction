    "text": "On a flying visit to the capitol we stopped in to Jamie's place for Sunday dinner and a chilled out, lovely jubbly evening.Barbecoa's friendly front of house was super helpful and didn't mind a bit when we called 2 hours before arriving to add another seat at the table. Oh, that table: we had a great spot by the massive picture window with its thisclose view of St Paul's Cathedral. The unobtrusive and enthusiastic waiter was a dream - shame about those unspecified-and-pricey bottles of water that were poured for the table (we asked for tap), and that awkward business of clearing away our breadboard when only half finished (despite my blue-blood good looks and faultless table manners, this Hen is not made of money - especially sterling) when I would have greatly enjoyed finishing what was started with that gorgeous, buttery naan. No worries, mate, the atmosphere was so silky smooth and the food was... so incredible.... We started with pig cheeks, calamari, that bread board and fantastic conversation. Barbecoa's relaxed atmosphere and comfy-couch seating gave us ample space to get settled and stuck in all at once. By the time the mains showed up I was glad to have only ordered a small plate of those gorgeous sweet-n-sour ribs. Mo Fears' short rib and champ, Buachaill sa Bhaile's rump steak and chips, my ribs and Teach Cara's crab salad were all shared around to much delight (and groaning bellies).By the time the dessert menu came around it was a gargantuan effort for all four of us to share a slice of lime-chocolate-meringue cheesecake. Afterwards we fairly rolled to the bus stop just a few seconds away. Pukka!",

I hate mushrooms and stupidly didn't look at what was on top of the burger - mushrooms. I managed to pick them off though. The chips were alright, a little on the cold side, but I definitely wouldn't pay\u00a35 for them if I was paying out of my own pocket - I was there for a lunch meeting! It was pretty hot sitting by the window and it wasn't even warm outside. Staff were quite attentive but nearly on the annoying side. The dessert was good. Admittedly I only had white chocolate ice cream but it was delicious. Overall it was good and I'd like to try the steak next time I go. Quite a good beer selection, too, which is always appreciated.",

To drink, you must order the flaming bourbon drink they do (and I'm forgetting the name of it)... it is spicy and sweet and cinnimony and delicious, and strong. The fried calamary is like none I've ever had before... it is a whole calamary sliced half way down the middle and deep fried. And oh yeah, it's good. The short rib here is super tender and delicious, and the creamed spinach is thick and with fantastic fried onions. Really, really recommend this place. Expect to pay for the quality you get here.",

I could have eaten bread all night. \u00a0I had the beef tartare for a starter. \u00a0Perfect compliment is lemon and capers on crispy toasted bread. \u00a0Again I could have eaten that all night. \u00a0For a main I had the Pulled Pork with a side of garlic mashed. \u00a0The fall apart pork melted in my mouth and loved the Jalape\u00f1o Cornbread, again I could go back and treat myself to a loaf of the perfectly hot bread.This isn't the place for everyone, \u00a0but I loved it. \u00a0Would go again and again. \u00a0I recommend Barbecoa to anyone in London who wants Southern US style BBQ. \u00a0Save up your \u00a3's and treat yourself. \u00a0I will be back.",

    "text": "Not a place I would recommend to anyone. It went all wrong from the start. You are greeted by young smiley women that serve no real purpose but to annoy you, and not help you get your coats sorted out or get your cocktail order. And as you finally get your order in, they'll ask to take you to your table. Bad timing.The whole place has a very industrial feel, which I quite liked. But with its classy open/large windows/black shiny atmosphere, it just doesn't fit the cafeteria style BBQ food. Clear mismatch here. And then you are taken to the most hideous gigantic bad taste concrete top tables - with one huge side had no seating. The thing could have accommodated 10 people. We were 4. This did not make conversation easy.The service was slow, and not very pleasant. The guy had clearly trouble talking to us over this huge table and we actually felt a little sorry for him. Menu looked quite good, but several dishes were run out (even the special, kinda lame at 8:15pm).We ordered the bread as an aperitivo. It came served with 250g of butter and all breads were already covered with oil. I had the crispy pig cheeks as a starter, and it was very fat and not really crispy. We had ordered wine at the beginning of dinner, but it arrived after we had finished the starter. I then had the pulled pork. It was ok, but I prefer the one at Bodean's (and it's cheaper). I skipped dessert as I felt a little sick after all that fat (probably my fault for ordering so poorly!).Overall I was VERY disappointed by the whole thing and find the restaurant's buzz is largely over hyped. Jamie should rethink through the whole concept. It just doesn't add up, and cost a hell of a lot for ok-ish food and bad service, in a somewhat wrong decor.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for lunch as walk ins last Friday as a special anniversary treat. I had no real high expectations of the place knowing it was a Jamie Oliver venture. Installed in a new development in the City right next to St Paul's, Barbecoa has a slightly Southern inspired menu and bills itself as the UK's first BBQ steakhouse. The restaurant, on the one side, offers diners stunning views overlooking the cathedral, and on the other, the large exciting open kitchen. Initial impressions were very positive, we were greeted warmly by a host who took our jackets and were quickly seated at our table. The interior was decorated in dark sultry tones and had an air of grown up chic to it, quite different to the more family orientated Jamie's Italian. I'd say perfect for a date. We ordered our drinks - I got my sugarfix from an imported root beer and he had a Bourbon Iced Tea from their interesting cocktail menu. For starters, (there were so many yummy sounding small plates it was difficult to decide!) we had the baby back ribs and chargrilled prawns on the waiter's recommendation - we were not disappointed. The stand out choice were the ribs though in terms of value for money and just sheer flavour. The BBQ sauce was just awesome! We even asked the waiter what was in it! Main course we chose to go for the special of the day Chateaubriand steak, with sides of ash roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach. Our steak came perfectly cooked to our liking (medium rare); juicy, tender and rested beforehand. Our sides were a lovely complement; the creamed spinach had a lovely crisp breadcrumb topping, which added a lovely texture and the sweet potatoes, although a slightly meagre portion, packed a wallop in flavour, in addition to the mustards and horseradish our waiter brought over. I have to admit I was a little envious of the duck fat chips on the neighbouring table but that quickly passed as I struggled to finish my food (this rarely happens btw!). For dessert, we settled on sharing (or rather I muscled in on his pud, you know how it is girls :P) a pecan pie served with bourbon ice cream and bloody orange caramel. Admittedly, I only had a couple of spoonfuls but it was very tasty, not too sweet or sickly. What really made the experiment for us was the exceptional service we had from our Aussie waiter. He was such a legend, seemed genuinely interested in food and even have us a your of the kitchen after we had paid, talking us through what all the fantastic contraptions were; from a wood smoker, tandoori oven, Argentinian grill to a Japanese robata grill and an Italian wood fire oven - amazing! Really recommend giving this place a try!",

    "text": "The one star seems harsh but taking everything into context I think it's fair. It's the fact you book a table and you're still treated as if your presence is an inconvenience by wait staff, trying to squeeze your way through the bustling, overcrowded restaurant to the tiny waiting area bar. The drinks; the choice is okay, not fantastic and quite expensive. I can understand why the food would be so pricey, not so much the drinks. Well I can understand, two celebrity chefs means a generous mark up. The clientele is as you'd expect for the location. A lot of city types yahing over glasses of wine and tourists taking pictures of everything, excited that they can see St Paul's. It's nice but I can't eat it. Much like the crackling I asked for as I waited for the table I'd booked for twenty minutes ago. Have you ever tried to eat a CD case? That's the closest description I can muster for these sorry mistakes for bar snacks. When we eventually get to our table we are crammed in, elbow-to-elbow with the table next to us. I can't help wondering if they were treating the customers like cattle as a testament to how much they know about steak. The calamari was flabby and moist. I have had better at TGI Fridays. I get irritated by this cutesy Jamie nonsense on the menu. \"Smashed Avocado.\" So, guacamole then? But never mind, I mean this isn't a seafood restaurant and I'm so hoping that this place can turn things around that I remain optimistic through to my main course.Ah Short Rib. I have memories of many a BBQ cook off so thankfully I know what a good short rib is. I also know it doesn't need to cost \u00a320. I know that at \u00a320 this better be a good short rib. This was a BAD short rib. A blackened, sad looking lump of meat on a slab of bone that was clean and dry and cold. The beef was dry, it was chewy and fibrous. It was the opposite of what it should have been, having been near enough creamated by the looks of it. The sniff of greenery underneath the meat was undersized, it would be better described as a garnish. I had a side of mashed potatoes. The only thing I recall about them is that when the bowl arrived I had absolutely no idea how it could have cost \u00a34 for some garlicky smash. Now in fairness this isn't the worst barbecue restaurant I have eaten at but it's pretty darn close. I have had far, far better at Bodeans. This place is pitched at people who are willing to spend a lot and likely won't be back for repeat business and it shows. It's okay. But when you get the bill and it's \u00a380 a head, okay becomes not good enough. The view is nice but it goes no way in making up for the poor food and service here. Celebrity endorsements to get people in the door is fine as long as you can live up to the hype and it seems that getting you in the door is all this place is about.I wondered if I'd just had a spot of bad luck but it seems that others have had the same issues so I don't feel bad giving the one star.Avoid.",

    "text": "Oh my...this place was hyped up by a coworker on business in London. Being a meat eater I was excited to try it while here. My wife and I ordered the pork cracklings for a starter. It was ok but some pieces were overcooked making it feel like you were chewing tiny gravel. On to the entrees. She ordered the lamb and I ordered the aged t-bone medium rare. She really liked the lamb on the skewers, they were tender and tasted fine. The steak on the other hand was, well...terrible. Ok I said it. It was 32\u00a3 and it comes from a butcher shop you own. How bad can it be??? \u00a0The steak was cooked well done on one half and rare on the other hand. No joking the steak was two tone. The rare side was slightly seared. S one hale was tough and the other raw. When the waiter asked how was everything I mentioned I didn't care for the steak and it seemed as if she was shocked. \u00a0Well I was. Service was just ok. Nothing to complain about but it was just ok. So, way overpriced food and average service for top dollar. \u00a0That's Barbecoa. After talking with other colleges they recommended Hawkesmoor so that will be my next destination. \u00a0 I'm oh for two in London after also striking out at Bread Kitchen.",

    "text": "I've finally found the best steak in London. It was a taste I'll never forget!Barbecoa is Jamie Oliver's steak restaurant with gorgeous views of St Paul's Cathedral. The restaurant is lovely - dimly lit with large seating areas. Perfect for corporate entertaining. They sell steak on the bone (t-bone or ribeye) which is very unusual. I ordered a ribeye on the bone served medium rare. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Delicious. It came with a sauce of my choice and some lovely sides.I thought the starters (we had mixed starters of chicken lollipops - not so great, calamari - lovely, ribs - lovely, parma ham and mozarella - lovely, tempura vegetables - lovely) were delish. I also had a taste of the rhubarb panacotta which was irresistible. Will I be going back? hell yes.",

It is a great mix of modern and comfortable. We enjoyed cocktails to start and the very good bread tray, but the shining star was the meat. Sara enjoyed the pork which was lean and tender with a sweet but balanced finishing sauce. I felt there might have been a hair too much sauce, as the meat didn't need much. I had the pit beef, which I was told was a boneless short rib cut, but not sure. In any event, it was delicious, tender, perfectly sauced and perfectly cooked. And plenty of it. Dessert was good, not off the charts. But I did enjoy the bourbon infused ice cream.Overall, a great visit. Cost wouldn't have been too bad if not in Pounds Sterling!",

    "text": "My date with Barbecoa fell on a Sunday. This happens to be a time when the Square Mile practically ceases to exist. In this post-apocalyptic landscape it was a pleasant surprise to amble into a restaurant with such casually stylish interiors (courtesy of Tom Dixon, it turns out) and great floor-to-ceiling windows exposing the late, weakened sun. St Paul's is in sight and the effect of the glass facade gives the whole place a lofty and modern feel.We were welcomed warmly and led to our table along the side of the kitchen, which can be peered into through more glass. Inside you'll see all sorts of ovens and grills and smokers and meats.The table itself was extremely comfortable. The space in this part of the restaurant is cleverly dissected and arranged by a continuous pink leather sofa, winding its way around tables and creating semi-autonomous little dining spots. Altogether, the place is expansive - fit for 200 diners - but cosy, comfortable, stylish. I loved it. In my mind are persistent allusions to BOA Steakhouse in LA, which is a compliment wrapped in a kiss.Our waitress was fantastic: punctual and polite but effortlessly friendly, too. We got straight to ordering, since we had already checked the menu on the way in childlike anticipation (and hunger). A note on the menu: it is among a select brotherhood of menus across the capital that come very close to matching my very own dream menu. Safe to say my expectations were high, my taste buds expectant. No pressure Jamie!From the 'Nibbles' section we ordered Big Green Olives On Ice and Pork Scratchings with Chipotle Sauce (both \u00a34). These were both fantastic. My favourite juicy green olives tasted salty and fresh chilled on the ice, while the pork scratchings were large and flavoursome, with that perfect combination of crunchy skin and soft fat. Perfect. We took three starters: Seabass Ceviche, Pit-Smoked Baby Back Ribs and Burrata with San Daniele Prosciutto. The first was essentially a seabass sashimi, lightly 'cooked' in its own citrus marinade of yuzu and seasoned with chilli, garlic, pomegranate and coriander cress. It tasted fresh, as all ceviche should, and although Barebcoa sells itself as a meat-lover's paradise, they did this seafood dish pleasantly indeed.The Pit-Smoked Baby Back Ribs were also seasoned with chilli and coriander, infusing each mouthful with a kick of spice. Underneath these added flavours and the glaze of barbecue sauce that coated the meat, there was a taste of inherent smokiness. BBQ baby back ribs are a favourite of mine, but I do prefer them simpler and with less fanciful ingredients, since all I'm really after is smoked or grilled meat with a messy smothering of sauce to finish. That's not to say that these weren't tasty, nor that the extra flavour and garnishing is a bad thing - just preference. However, these aren't the kind of ribs whose meat falls of the bone, it was more tough. In the words of Bodean's - not the kind of beef you can eat without beef!The Burrata and Prosciutto dish came in a long oval plate, with the ingredients nestled on a bed of rocket. Amongst the cheese and ham were sweet figs and almonds, all topped off with white balsamic vinaigrette and chilli. The meat was delicious and soft, with a light, salty dryness. I was slightly underwhelmed by the burrata, firstly because there wasn't much of it in terms of ratio to the other ingredients, secondly because we mostly received the top knot part of the hard outer shell and thirdly because I absolutely love burrata. I was hoping for its rich creaminess, like the ones served at Admiral Codrington or La Petite Maison. As a whole, the dish was more of a salad and although it still worked well as such, it could have been better.For mains we ordered the Pulled Pork Shoulder from the Texas pit smoker (\u00a316) and the Lamb Skewers from the wood and charcoal grill (\u00a318). My pork had a good texture, it was tender and not dry, but the barbecue sauce was a notch excessive and about the only thing I could taste - slightly one dimensional. Nevertheless I enjoyed my dish, and although I usually avoid waffles, the accompanying waffle provided a very different but somehow complimentary drier base onto which you could pile the saucy pulled pig meat. Unusual but not unenjoyable at all.The Lamb Skewers went down well. These came in a dish of wet polenta and were accompanied by some king oyster mushrooms and gorgonzola cheese. The lamb meat was also tender and the polenta base tasted better than it looked, although not as creamy as others.The general consensus at the table regarding the food at Barbecoa: nothing special but nothing drastically amiss. Parts of it were tremendously enjoyable and parts of it could have been better, with some dishes executed finer than others. The surroundings more than anything facilitate a relaxed and leisurely evening.",

The only complaint on the ribs were that the short rib was a touch on the chewy side. I like that but some people don't. We got the double pork chop and my friend didn't like it so they immediately replaced it with the beef which was excellent. I am not a person who gets dessert often but I actually had a problem deciding what to have. I landed in the brownie and it was delicious. My friends had the snickersphere and loved it. The service was perfect. The atmosphere is perfect. Who can complain about staring at St James cathedral from your table? Great night to be sure.",

Took my in laws there to say thanks for helping us move house. I paid and had a shock when the bill came to \u00a3240. We all had fillet steak, no starters and a bottle of wine between us. We found the place busy, noisy and the ambience to be not so nice. There is a beautiful view out of the large windows off St Pauls, but you're jammed into the restaurant like sardines. With everyone being so close to each other and the place being so busy, it was noisy and hard to hear. There seemed to be a lot of wiating staff on too. The service was good and our waitress friendly and knowledgable. We had some really tasty bread and then the steak just blew us away. That is what we cam for. I'd read an article sayng this was one of the best steak places in the UK and I have to agree. The fillet steak is the best I have tasted. End of. If you love steak and are willing to shell out, then I'd give this place a try. There are a few down sides (as desribed above) but you will struggle to find better steak outside of Argentina!",

    "text": "We chose this place for a work lunch because it was near the office, with an entrance on the first floor of the One New Change shopping complex but the restaurant upstairs. I haven't been overly impressed by the Jamie's Italian chain across the UK, but Barbecoa is a stand-alone restaurant best known for its steaks. To start, we got the tandoori naan with whipped butter, an usual offering but certainly hit the palate, and mixed olives, which were both \"served two ways\", which meant that two of the olives were coated in bread crumbs and fried, and the other two were served on ice. Then for appetizers, I ordered the crispy calamari, served with chipotle hot sauce, guacamole, and rocket. I certainly didn't think the hot sauce was that hot, and the guacamole was rather smooth and I wouldn't have taken it for guacamole if the menu hadn't said so. The calamari itself was fine, but it is a small portion. As a main, I ordered the daily special, which was a selection of 3 steaks that came with some mushrooms, and my colleagues ordered the dover sole and shared sides of mushrooms and red leaves (salad). My platter was far too much for a lunch meal but all was perfectly cooked pink, and the mushrooms are a good complement. What I must say is that the red leaves (salad) is the most disappointing side dish... it is half a head of red lettuce, which is very bitter, uncut with some gorgonzola cheese and dressing tossed onto it, but of course the flavouring can't penetrate much. You have to peel the leaves from the head of lettuce yourself. It is a pity they don't have many other options for vegetable greens on the menu, but definitely don't order this one. Overall I think this is a nice place, definitely gets the meat right, but I don't really understand what they are going for with the rest of the menu, with some Indian-inspired dishes and a big selection of seafood starters. If you are looking for steaks, you could go to Hawksmoor and get the same meat but amazing starters and side dishes.",

    "text": "This is a pretty good restaurant... provided you stick to the pork! The beef steaks are mediocre for the price. I ordered the T-bone medium rare, and it arrived well done, was tough and lacked the taste one would expect of a GBP 37 steak. I don't believe the lack of taste was due to the steak being overcooked - I tend to like my steak on the rare side, but for most people's tastes, it would have been fine. Instead, the quality of the meat was inferior to what I've experienced in other London steakhouses, and given the price, I expected better. On a previous visit I ordered the chateaubriand. It was good, but again, I have had better.In short, if you crave steak, and want that melt-in-your-mouth feeling, go to Goodmans or Hawksmoor. Barbecoa strikes me as the type of restaurant trying to compete with the likes of Hawksmoor and Goodmans, but is simply not in their league. Sure, the view of St.Paul's is great. It's a Jamie Oliver restaurant, but that doesn't make the steak taste any better! Having said this, I would return, but only to eat the Texas style BBQ pork.",

What I liked:- The skewer with the chunks of lamb was delish.- The chips were also good.- The chicken looked good. What I disliked: - The menu doesn't really tell you what you'll get. for example 'Lamb Skewers' translates into 'two lamb skewers with differently prepared lamb on each'. I don't believe there was any mention that the chicken came with guacamole. This works okay for basic BBQ dishes, but would be nice to have a little more description on some of the others. I shouldn't have to ask the waiter for the details of every dish on the menu. Which brings me to my second issue....- The service was painfully slow. I didn't really mind because we were just chatting, and didn't have anywhere to be, but my god, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get the waiter's attention and another 15 to bring a latte. Overall a good experience, but not great. I would happily go back if someone else suggested it, but I probably wouldn't suggest it again myself.",

There were several other groups in the waiting area for their reservation as well, so they must have screwed up on scheduling.

The venue is split into two, the restaurant, and the incredible butchery on the street below, which is where our event took place.Having been a big fan of meats, and the arts of butchering, this was right up my street and I couldn't wait to dive on in. Being it the view of St. Paul's Cathedral, the butchers is in a prime location for grabbing those all important ingredients for your hearty hangover breakfast on Saturday morning!Not only do they do delicious sausages and bacon, they run master classes of how to butcher a 170 kilo side of beef, and how to get the best cuts of beef from the carcass. With Marco, our lead butcher, being from the Netherlands, Zach from New Zealand, and Adam from Poland, we learnt a great deal about how the art of butchery differentiates between countries. Even Johnny, the chef from upstairs, came to have a little nose on his day off and to share a few of his cooking tips!It was clear from how the lads spoke whilst demonstrating that they really do have a love for their job, and live to pass on their knowledge to anyone who is willing to listen. I learnt a whole lot from them including that fillet isn't actually the best cut for flavour, and the off cuts such as shin make great slow roasting joints if you stuff it full of marrow, garlic and rosemary, then roast it in a casserole dish with some wine, balsamic and shallots and in a few hours you will have one of the most beautiful roast meats nature can provide. Bet you didn't know that!Within two hours the whole side of beef and been diced and sliced into more cuts than you can imagine, and left us standing in awe of the skill they possess. Luckily for my plus one and I, we were joined by Paul Green the head Sommelier at Barbecoa, so we were given a class on the best red wines to spoil ourselves with to bring out the flavour of the meats. Such valuable knowledge and a great tasting session!I really would recommend taking one of these classes to realise how amazing these lads are at their job! I can't put into words how skilled they are and the passion they omit is more than inspirational.",

    "text": "A disappointing experience. I went there with the expectation of having a really good steak, probably also due to the reputation of Jamie Oliver. Well, my experience was a very different one. The place was packed until the last seat, and it is quite loud, but this didn't bother me too much. But then the steak came. I ordered the Dry-Aged Ribeye, and it was, well, just a very average steak. It was chewy as hell, and my plate was filled with chunks of meat I was unable to swallow.The sauce I ordered as a side was a joke. Truffle Gravy sounds really tempting, but all you get is a watery, thin liquid with a tiny slice of dry Black Truffle inside. As a condiment, the sauce is unusable, because it tastes like, well, water.Did I expect something REALLY different from Jamie Oliver? Yes, absolutely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely not. I guess a good show master doesn't make a good chef automatically.",

Absurdly early imo so worth taking note of.Atmosphere:Really airy, spacious restaurant with high ceilings that features large glass windows with nice views of St Paul's. I didn't pay too much attention to the decor so I'm going to assume it was understated and tasteful.Food:Was marginally annoyed at having to pay lunch prices (because their brunch is notably cheaper) but anyway, I ordered the short ribs and they were so so good. Tender, fatty and just with this really nice smokey flavour. It's served on a bed of mash and watercress. The watercress did add to it though I felt there should have been more. The mash was also perfect. Creamy without being too thick and with a somewhat meaty sauce on it. I'd reccomend it to anyone.Had a side of duck fat chips which were also excellent. Also tried a bite of my friend's T-bone steak. Thought it was good but wasn't really worth \u00a337. Hawksmoor/Goodman is definitely better.For dessert we shared the brownie with popcorn and salted caramel ice cream. The texture of the brownie was surprisingly rich and almost leaned towards chocolate cake. It was very good as well though not in the same league as the short ribs.Others:Service was impeccable. Probably helped by the fact that the restaurant was quite empty but our waiter was friendly, helpful and attentive. Pretty solid beer selection. Tried the dark lager they had on tap and found it to be particularly enjoyable.",

We were off to a good start, next up the starters, I went for the smoked ribs in a spicy bbq sauce, WOW, ribs were tender, nice smokiness to them with a little chilli kick at the end, heaven! Now unlike my usual fat self I started to feel a bit full, and was dreading the challenge that was up ahead, the barbecoa burger, but when it came out it made my smile, it looked amazing, so I did the manly thing and ploughed through it like it was my first meal for weeks. \u00a0The burger had a slight pink tinge to it, very juicy, the bacon gave it a nice salty smokey flavour and when mixed with the cheddear cheese they used, a very tasty burger, the duck fat chips were also very good, very heavy thou, I was now food drunk, pudding was not an option.So my Barbecoa experience was a good one, will defiantly be heading back here to sample the other delights on the menu.",

Both were a tad overcooked, but weren't bad. Ended with the snickersphere that was also \"not bad\". I must have had too high expectations because I found the food unremarkable for the hype and pricing they have. That being said, the view, vibe, and service were very good.

We were guys and gals and left it to Hus to take care of everything. He brought us a selection of starters which were lovely esp. the lollypop chicken in chocolate sauce - ah man these were good, the calamari and the crab salad. The mains were simply amazing. The steaks were the best I've had and both the fillet and sirloin were gorgeous. I can't remember which one it was but the whole side of beef was cooked then brought to the table where we sliced it ourselves. It melted in the mouth. Perfection. The side again were great and everything was spot on. Shame my memory sucks but it was a while ago now (Dec 13) and haven't checked into yelp for ages. Go there and try it out.Hus you're a legend.",

Beautiful restaurant and warm service. We ordered a few appetizers to start-- the calamari, the bread platter, and some salad. All were very small portions, be warned. The bread platter was more interesting to look at than it was to eat. Some type of pumpkin-y bread (delish) and na'an, stuck together like a sailboat. I ordered the short rib, and it was delicious. The meat was tender and well flavored, and the best part was the mash that came with the dish! I don't even want to know how much butter and cream was in it. The duck fat chips were disappointing, I thought. Tasted more greasy than anything else. It wasn't salty enough. The mixed green salad was boring. The salad with creamy bacon dressing, on the other hand, was delicious... then again you can't go wrong with bacon.The other popular dish at my table was the pulled pork with coleslaw and waffle. We ended the meal with fantastic espresso. Overall a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "The food menu is very meat heavy with no fish or vegetarian options for the main course. The starters section has a few seafood options like Calamari, Scallops and the Chargrilled Wild Tiger Prawns w/ Flamed Mango Salsa (\u00a313) which we ordered and were delicious. I'm a fan of Pork Scratchings and insisted we get a portion, which came with a subtle Apple & Thyme Sauce (\u00a34). They were quite disappointing though, very crispy as you'd expect but massively under seasoned and if anything, a little bland. We also ordered the Pit-Smoked Baby Back Ribs w/ Coriander & Chilli (\u00a310) which were stunning and a portion of Crispy Pig Cheeks w/ Piccalilli, Chive & Lamb's Lettuce Salad (\u00a39). The pig cheeks were fine but I much preferred the way Pitt Cue do them - deep fried in a crispy batter.Almost half of the main course options are steak - T-Bone, Rump, Fillet, Sirloin of Rib-Eye for two. They're all very expensive... more than Hawksmoor in fact but that didn't stop Alex and I. She opted for the 225g Fillet Steak w/ Bone Marrow, Smoked B\u00e9arnaise, Shallot & Herb Salad (\u00a335) and I had the 320g Dry-Aged Sirloin Steak w/ Bourbon Green Peppercorn Sauce & Sticky Roasted Red Onions (\u00a332). The fillet was delicious and beautifully tender as you'd expect. It was definitely nearer to rare than the medium-rare Alex had asked for though. My sirloin was tasty but not exceptional and I'm not sure how I feel about spending that much money on one piece of meat, especially when it was literally a piece of meat on a plate with no accompaniments. Is it really too great an expense to include a side in the price...?This excess was balanced out by Darren's Pulled Pork Shoulder w/ Waffle, BBQ Sauce & Coleslaw (\u00a317) and Antonia's Pit Beef w/ Smoky Baked Beans (\u00a316). Both of these were superb, especially the Pit Beef and considering they were pretty much half the price of the steaks I'll certainly be having one of them next time. We ordered two portions of Duck Fat Chips w/ Volpaia Vinegar & Salt (\u00a34) and a Baby Gem Salad (\u00a35) as well. There's a lack of simple veg sides here and we actually asked for the salad to come without the creamy bacon dressing.",

I shared a medium rare rib eye for two persons. I would like to see the steak served on a hot platter, to avoid the fat congealing in front of your eyes, as you plough through the more than ample portion size.The restaurant is cool, buzzy and trendy.

They also had amazing scallop ceviche and short ribs.My friend and I ordered wood-fired mushrooms, and they had been liberally glazed with worcestershire sauce. We also had grilled chicken, which was flavorful but a little hard. We ordered mojito and chocolate martini, and both were great as well.Now you're wondering why I gave only 3 stars. I thought of taking off only 1 star, but the service was SO bad that I had to take 2 off. First, we tried pushing back our reservation 1 hour later because we were coming all the way from Manchester (after flying in from abroad) and the train schedules have changed. The person on the phone was extremely rude and said there won't be a table until 2 days later, even though we only wanted a table for two. So we informed her that we'd like to keep our original reservation time and date, but would be 20-30 minutes late. She then said that we would no longer have a table then.My friend and I thought it was just plain weird. How can there be no more table? Under our original reservation, did they expect us to finish eating within 20-30 minutes?! Doesn't make any sense!We went ahead anyway, rushing to get there in time. We even had our large luggage bags with us. They were kind enough to store it in the back, but looked displeased about doing it. Throughout the dinner, all service staff were rude and trying to rush us. I do agree with many of the reviews that they all treated our presence as an inconvenience - as if they're trying to get rid of us ASAP.Bottom line: if you can tolerate crappy service for amazing food and drinks, this is one of the best places to go (remember, in terms of FOOD!). But if you can't stand rude wait staff, then avoid this place at all costs (don't even call in).",

Enormous tables surrounded by leather sofas are great fun for large groups who want to be loud and behave badly ... Food does taste of smokeThe mediocre ... Meat was pretty much too dull to speak ... Thank goodness it was well cooked and tasted of smoke.The bad ... Wine list ridiculously overpriced ... The staff are clearly more used to working in super markets ... Shift managers wandering around looking for work when it is quiet and a sommelier clearly well trained in plus sell techniques but perhaps less well trained in wine ... I have to admit that I felt like I was eating in a slightly more up market Aberdeen Angus more than I was a restaurant that ever expected customers to want to come back ...My advice don't go unless for some reason forced by circumstance",

We had some lovely Prosecco to start, along with some finger foods - a bread board and pork scratchings. (I had never tried pork scratchings before, but I now understand the name... I felt my tooth enamel \"scratching\" away.) It wasn't the greatest, but the bread made up for it; 'twas moist, salty and even a little bit nutty. Deelish.One of my dinner buddies coerced me into ordering a \"Death in the Afternoon\" cocktail, made with Absinthe. It was (surprisingly) lovely. Our entrees and and side orders were AMAZING. I got the tiger prawns (a starter) as my main, with creamed spinach, duck fat chips and ash-cooked sweet potatoes. Even though they were good, I barely touched the chips because the other sides were TO DIE FOR. They topped the creamed spinach with bread crumbs, which made for the perfect texture and taste. I tried my dinner buddy's rump steak, which was without a doubt the best steak I'd ever had.The waitstaff was experienced and pleasant, there were windows into the kitchen (which is insane, speaking as a former waitress... restaurant kitchens are usually loud, testosterone-filled and crazy!) and we didn't have much of a wait for food. The only complaint is that the music was much too loud, so we had to yell to hear each other, which is always annoying.",

I had the rhubarb g&t - it was light and refreshing. My hubs and I shared the ribeye for 2, accompanied by charred broccoli and onion rings. The meat was perfectly cooked and so delicious. We ordered a smoked Bernaise sauce that was over the top good. And please save room for dessert. \u00a0The caramel apple with fennel ice cream and goat cheese is one of the best desserts I've ever had. So why the four stars and not 5? \u00a0Steak knives. They were dull as toast and we had to chop through our steak, which was very tender. For the price of the meal, Mr. Oliver, please buy some decent knives. Go, go go. \u00a0And enjoy the street view of. St. Paul 's.",

In this respect, I think it has the edge on Madison ( which is also in New Change).Now, food wise , this is (as if you need me to tell you) a BBQ place, first and foremost. The meat is undoubtedly good, well aged, etc etc, and prices are reassuringly steep( think \u00a320 odd and up for a main). Given all this, they still go in for the graceless practice of gouging you for sides. Is a small serving of mash worth \u00a35? Nope. If I've paid top whack for a main, isn't that a bit mean? In sum, this is effectively another chain-type restaurant in the Jamie Oliver franchise- a gold plated version, but, meh, that's what it is.",

No starter for me as a steak for lunch was already uncharacteristically heavy for me. Crammed spinach on the side was good. Split a sticky toffee pudding which was a solid take, served with ice cream rather than the clotted variety. Another colleague had the pork chop special and a side salad and both looked above average. Overall, any of these dishes are done better elsewhere and I was just expecting better give the cost and the marquee chef.",

    "text": "Brought to life by Jamie Oliver and Adam Perry Lang, Barbecoa is billed as the UK's first barbeque steakhouse where they cook their meats in traditional wood ovens and smokers or over the flames of open fire pits.When you enter, there' s a hostess on the ground floor and I wasn't sure we were in the right place because it was so empty and quiet, but then we went upstairs and immediately the volume changed. \u00a0We walked what seemed to be the length of the dining floor to reach our table tucked at the end far away from the best view from the restaurant - the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral.This place was crowded and very loud. \u00a0The view of the open kitchen and especially the sight of massive steaks cooking on the grill were mesmerizing.We ordered a number of starters, mains and sides. \u00a0While we enjoyed our meal, it was by far the most expensive on our trip and not necessarily the most memorable. \u00a0Don't get me wrong it was good, but I do think we can eat just as well, if not better, and at a lower price tag back home. \u00a0Anyhow we ordered:* SEABASS CEVICHE - With yuzu, chilli, garlic, pomegranate and coriander cress. \u00a0Perhaps my favorite part of the meal. * CRISPY CALAMARI - With smashed avocado, lemon and rocket. \u00a0The smallest portion of calamari I've ever seen.* BARBECOA BURGER - With Westcombe cheddar, streaky bacon, sweet onions and chips. \u00a0A decent burger, but not very memorable. \u00a0I was not a fan of the bacon which was chewy and lacked a smokey taste.* DRY-AGED SIRLOIN STEAK - With pan-roasted escarole, garlic, anchovy and lemon. \u00a0It was fine, but not the best sirloin I've had.* MASHED POTATOES - With confit garlic. \u00a0I'm not big on mashed potatoes in general, but liked this side.* CREAMED SPINACH - With toasted breadcrumbs and shallots. \u00a0Also not big on creamed spinach but this is what my dining companion wanted. \u00a0I had one forkful and that was enough for me.* MARKET SALAD - With chervil vinaigrette. \u00a0Nothing special, but I needed some greens.We had to hit one fancy-shmancy joint when we were in London and we checked that off our list with Barbecoa.",

We ordered the chateaubriand and bone-in rib-eye to share. Both were cooked to a nice medium rare. The beef itself had great dry-aged flavor. My only complaint was the plating of the rib-eye. If you're going to carve the rib-eye (which you should since it's so big), I would like to see it plated in a manner that reflects the original shape of the steak. Stacking the bone vertically and draping slices of rib-eye on top of each other somehow doesn't give the same steak feeling.",

As are the crab.Once these were finished we were shortly afterwards brought our mains. Most of our party had ordered steaks. Our Malbac wine also arrived. The steaks you could see had been cooked excellently and were fantastic cuts of meat. Unfortunately the Chateau Briand I was sharing had come relatively cold. Decided not to say anything as everyone else's meals were fine. So just continued. The beef dripping chips and spinach side were lovely.For desert we ordered one of everything and decided to share them. And ordered an accompanying desert wine. I must highly recommend the Snickers desert and the Sticky Toffee Pudding there were to die for. I was also very impressed with the Panacotta.An excellent meal with great service and a fantastic view of St Pauls. Only shame was a cold steak. But would definitely visit again.",

So when I had to chance to be in St Pauls, it was a must that I visited Barbecoa for dessert, being a pastry chef, I had to experience the true essence of Jamie Olivers restaurant. More steak and british cuisine as it is, this time round I wasn't as interested in food, although some of the plates I saw looked really good.They have their new summer menu out right now, packed with an abundance of seasonal flavours, I opted for the Snickersphere, ever since I saw the youtube of Jamie dive into the sphere, and watched him eating it, I wanted it even more. What you see in the pictures, is what you get on the plate! It's not misleading like all the other places. Also the atmosphere is very subtle, not too pretentious, nice high ceilings, a very big spacious restaurant overlooking St Pauls Cathedral. \u00a0The Snickersphere was amazeballs!!!! Seriously 11/10, the texture between salty and sweetness just hit the nail on the head for me. Peanuts, salted caramel, popping candy, vanilla gelato, the accurate attention to detail on the plate, which on my palate was just too good. One of the best desserts I had, even their cocktails were really nice, I opted for the Mr Murrays Cream Soda, it came presented in a tiny milk glass bottle, with a cute paper straw, vanilla foam, was almost like a dessert on its own. Not too strong, light, refreshing, but then once you get halfway, the vodka really hits you. After polishing off dessert 1, I wanted more, as it was light, refreshing, I was a bit hungry still so I ordered dessert 2 and opted for Creme Fraiche Pannacotta with Elderflower Jelly, Strawberry Sorbet, Biscuit Crumb, basil and fresh strawberries. Light, airy, creamy, the wibble wobble on the plate, was everything you needed on a Sunday evening and by the end of that, my stomach felt just right! 11/10 again. Highly recommend this place, the pastry chefs are geniuses, taking ordinary chocolate bars and creating magic, which tastes way better than a snickers bar! The staff are great, really helpful with the menuI will definitely be returning during the winter to see what they come up with next :)",

We were two adults and three kids, everyone enjoyed their dinner and drinks. They made awesome non-alcoholic coctails for the kids too =)All in all, I will visit again. This is perfect for dinner with friends or dinner with a loved one. Prices are not the cheapest in town, but its worth the money.",

We sit down.I take a chance - ordering the grilled vegetable salad in a BBQ joint - but when a bountiful plate of produce arrives I'm happy I did.The pulled pork is also a delightful and savoury surprise, accompanied by slaw and cornbread.

She led us upstairs and wow, the place is beautiful. I mean, the view of St. Paul's alone... but it's pretty snazzy even without that. The service throughout was friendly and efficient.However, I did not like the food. We started with short-rib croquettes, which were very dry and bland. I then had the sea trout starter, which was fine and perhaps the best thing of the meal. My St. Louis ribs, though, were basically inedible, with very, very little meat to consume. The dessert was pretty good, but I felt that the star of the show was a miss. I wouldn't return.",

That didn't go over well with the reception staff and they expressed their displeasure.The staff at St. Paul's will want to ensure that they are behaving themselves as the resto is close enough to discern otherwise.The resto is loud and large. Fancy-schmancy. Dense with beautiful people. Expensive, but not out of all proportion. A very nice Sangiovese was \u00a38.50. A specialty cocktail called the Club Fizz (\u00a35) was light and refreshing. The lamb shoulder (\u00a322) was tender and flavourful as was the pit beef (\u00a322). The Szechuan calamari appetizer with yuzu mayo was a favoured share. Sourdough bread came with veal butter (\u00a35). I had a plain garden salad that I quite enjoyed (\u00a33). Two of our party each ordered the mac and cheese (\u00a37). They automatically add a service charge of %12.5. I don't care how they describe it on the bill, there's nothing \"discretionary\" about it.This was my first Jamie Oliver resto. It was fine for what it was. Not sure that I fell in love with the brand enough to go out of my way to go to another.",

From the moment Mr Debs and myself walked in downstairs, we could see we were in a rather fancy place. I mean, an actual reception area for a restaurant? Colour me impressed! We headed upstairs to wait for the rest of our guests and ordered a couple of schooners of the Organic Hells Lager which was very nice. I was really intrigued by the veal butter and so ordered the sourdough to start, which we shared - the bread was really tasty and the butter just set it off perfectly. I then went for the pit beef (I'm blaming the amount of Man V Food we'd been watching beforehand on the fact I was desperate for it) and it was delicious! Really tender and flavourful, and the lettuce on the side with bacon and shallot crumble was tasty as well.Staff were impeccable the whole night - attentive without being overbearing and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. Very sleek decor and it certainly feels upmarket. As it's right next to St Paul's Cathedral, the view you get of said cathedral is utterly amazing.The only thing I guess I would grumble about would be the price - but I suppose for the location, the atmosphere and the service it's to be expected! For a fancy dinner out in London, it's pretty ideal.",

Wraps and salad boxes are also available, however, today I felt the urge to treat myself, it was payday yesterday after all.I was delighted when the friendly member of staff handed over my food, a little less delighted when it felt very light, but happily made my way off and back to the office. I got settled in and opened up the box, taking a snap of my food for yelp of course, and was pretty happy with what lay in front of me. The coleslaw looked great, fresh and not too covered in mayonnaise, the beans and sauce smelt lovely and the generous pork belly cut looked like it had been slow cooked beyond perfection. I got stuck in and, to my disappointment, there was no crackling on the pork belly, however, what it lacked in crackling it more than made up for in flavour and taste. Coming in at around \u00a36 for a lunch its not the cheapest option out there nor the most expensive and my only word of advice is, if you're starving and looking for a fulling lunch this may not be for you. If you are after a lovely lunch time treat, and saving room for dinner, then you're definitely in good company with this meal.",

They have a nice selection of cocktails, Jessica Rabbit anyone? This concoction includes vanilla vodka, strawberry puree, elderflower, lime & proseco. Yum-um! H had his usual martini & we had fun watching the mixologist making a stirred martini. Once everyone arrived we were seated by the wall of windows & the open kitchen. My niece insisted we start with the Devil's Cornbread. Being from the south I had my doubts. JO is pretty daring adding this to his menu. But oh my! Served in an iron skillet, the cornbread was light & airy. They top it with cheddar & 'nduja. Yes, yes the devil had his hand in this sinfully delicious bread. Very highly recommended starter. For our main course H & I opted for the Chateaubriand for Two (which could feed 4) topped with truffle butter. I thought it would be hard to top the Devil's Cornbread but this steak hit my top 5 best. Cooked to perfection, you could tell this was a very choice cut of beef. Really, no need for any sauce or butter. The natural flavor of the beef was outstanding & the texture perfect. I know we had sides but for the life of me I can not remember what we had. But the choices are unique like roasted pumpkin, beef dripping chips & gruyere-truffle mac & cheese.The dining area is gorgeous. Modern, warm colors with gold. The layout of the restaurant had a nice flow & with all of the windows seems much larger. The service was exceptional. Really love this place & had a wonderful evening!",

We started with the trout which was a light yet tasty appetizer. \u00a0She has the fillet and I had the pit beef. Both were wonderfully prepared with amazing flavor. We shared the truffled Mac and Cheese and Devil's Cornbread. Very nice accompaniments for our beef dishes. The food was everything we had hoped it would be. \u00a0However, the service was lacking. \u00a0When we arrived for our six o'clock reservation, the restaurant was not busy and our server was attentive and the timing of cocktails and our starter was perfect. The restaurant started to get busy and the attentiveness decreased dramatically. \u00a0Our entrees were served with only slight delay but then we were forgotten. It took quite a while after finishing for our plates to be cleared and then even longer to be offered dessert menus and after dinner drinks. We finally were able to order dessert and it arrived before our drinks. Eventually the wine appeared for my friend and finally my coffee arrived. \u00a0Then we were forgotten once more and we waited a very long time for our server to be close enough so that we could request our check. \u00a0So if you don't mind a very extended dinner, then give Barbecoa a try. I would not recommend it if you have plans after dinner because you will likely be very late if what I experienced is the norm and not the exception.",

The Devils cornbread is a must have. It comes in a cast iron skillet, baked with gooey cheese on top. It's a bit spicy, but not so much that it's overpowering. Don't be afraid of the bread with veal butter! The butter had a mild smokey flavor which pairs well with the warm bread. The filet with smoked b\u00e9arnaise sauce was divine. The steak was cooked perfectly (just ask for extra sauce you'll need it!) It came with bone marrow, but it was on the side so don't fear if that's not your thing. The Mac and cheese is always a must.

Not that I could taste much of anything as my mouth was on fire.I really wish it was compulsory to warn people about non-consensual chilli peppers so they can make a different choice.Nice view though. And other people's steaks looked nice. The side dishes were also lovely (what I could taste of them).",

For my appetiser I had a sourdough bread with Chicken Butter. I first thought it was the craziest thing ever invented. But it was really delicious. Then for my main course I had a Rump Steak. I really don't know how to describe it because it was so delicious. The meat melted in my mouth and the mushrooms on top of it were a great touch. The service was friendly, attentive and fun.To all meat lovers out there: If you like meat, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

The appetizers were great but because the main course was awful, I just don't think that $130 lunch was worth it.",

Went for the rib-eye medium rare and awaited a feast. What I got was a disappointed, for the price it was chewy, sinuey and edging on inedible!!

    "text": "What surprised me most about this place is that it's so massive! Seemed to carry on for ages around corners as the waitress led us to the bar area to wait for our table. Still manages to keep a buzzing, friendly feel though with almost every table occupied on a Tuesday lunchtime.I went for the burger which was good though nothing to rave about - cooked a nice medium rare just as I'd asked and held its structure well (nothing worse than a soggy bun). The duck fat chips were always going to be tasty. My colleagues also seemed to enjoy the steaks though put them on a par with a Hawksmoor; these are on the pricey side as you'd expect, up to the \u00a375 chateaubriand for two.More exciting turned out to be the starting nibbles - two rounds of pork scratchings disappeared pretty quick and don't miss the bread board. They must also have some mutant olive breeding going on given the size of the giant puglian olives on ice. Ahh that reminds me to warn you that the small open pots on the table are salt and pepper; a colleague managed to mistake these for a place to chuck his olive stones (sorry to whoever got our table next).All A-OK so far then but I was further impressed by the staff who were attentive in re-filling wine glasses (almost overly so!) and handled a party of 12 with minimal confusion and fuss. The place itself is welcoming and I loved the unique view of St Paul's from where we sat (you can ask to sit on this side in advance - would make an extra nice backdrop for a date I think). A nice choice for a spendy meal if you're after the 'busy and bustling' vibe rather than 'peacefully intimate'. Seems to be holding its own against Ramsay's (also massive) place opposite too. I'm not rushing back for the food given there's so much out there to try, but I did manage to scope out an exciting cocktail list which I'll hopefully try at a later date.",

Our server was polite but seemed unenthusiastic. She offered no recommendations either. We started our meal with the cracklings and found it bland and unsalted. Although it came with a sauce, It still felt like it was missing salt. Of course there was noSalt or pepper on the table . The server also did not come back check to see if our meal was satisfactory. \u00a0For our main courses I had the pulled lamb and my Fianc\u00e9 had the Saint Louise Rib. The pulled lamb was cooked to perfection but lacked in seasoning and flavour. I needed To ask for BBQ sauce to pull the meal together. The sides which were a parsley & lemon salad and then something that looked liked pickled veggies and minted creme fraiche were way too overpowering and rich. I also had sweet potatoes and mine were soggy,oily and tasted very rich. I also didn't like the presentation. It looked burnt and just cut up and greasy. The Rib entree was nicely cooked but again also Very rich. It seemed that the food pairings Didn't feel balanced and tastedunseasoned. The ambience was beautiful and the best part of our meal was the cocktail and the beef dripping chips. Our experience was Not what we expected and certainlyDisappointing. We've had better food and service at Chain restaurants run with high standards front and back of the house.",

The staff can be quite unhelpful and although the maitre d had some communication equipment so should be well aware what we were waiting for (i.e. getting seated), we had to approach her. Not the best welcome but would have forgotten it quickly if they didnt try to sit us down right next to the toilets. We had a reservation a the restaurant wasnt full so really didnt understand why they thought this was the best table at the time. There were quite a few empty tables so we asked to be moved; after answering quite a sharp \"Why?\" question and moving twice, we managed to get a table which was great. Food was really tasty, however, my partner wasnt feeling great later in the evening. Overall, as it is quite an expensive place, we expected a better service and after feeling unwell later, we probably won't be going back. There are many places where they'll treat you nicer for far less money.",

    "text": "Barbecoa is OK, but a bit too pricey for what you get. First of all, we arrive right on time for our reservation and have to wait 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready. Not a huge deal, but this plus the fact that the cloakroom was full and we had to haul our winter coats across the restaurant to our table, did not exactly get things off to an amazing start. On the atmosphere, I would say that it has a great view of St. Paul's which is visible from most areas, even if you are not right next to the windows. The decor is nice, I particularly liked the plush pink seats and open kitchen. However, on a Saturday night, this is not London's most romantic atmosphere-- not a place to go to have a long conversation over your meal... its quite loud (I don't know what I was expecting for a Saturday night, maybe I'm being unfair). The service was adequate. We ordered the bread, olives, and calamari, all of which were delicious. The bread particularly was not just your average bread board, but a selection of breads from around the world, and nice sized portions for even 4 people. The olives were standard fare Jamie olives from his other restaurants, but good. The calamari was cooked perfectly, not too crunchy or chewy, not too much batter, and came with the most perfect avocado (pseudo-guacomole) side that just made it incredible. Only complaint is that the portion was not too generous. For entrees, I got the bone-in strip steak and my friend got the lamb steak. For sides, we got the mashed potatoes and a side salad. I have to say that the biggest disappointment of the night, other than the atmosphere, was my steak. Maybe my expectations were too high, but at these prices it should be near-perfect. It was extremely fatty in most places and hard to chew. Although the potatoes were amazing (cooked twice in the oven, so interesting texture) and made the steak taste better than it was. I was stuffed by that point, so I skipped on the dessert. Overall, I would go back perhaps on a less busy weeknight and would go for the fillet steak (fyi price is wrong on their online menu at the moment, I recall it being \u00a335 instead of \u00a330) when feeling cash flush... but I will probably not return for a long time to give them space to work the kinks out.",

    "text": "A joint venture between someone famed for his passion for high-quality fresh ingredients (Jamie Oliver), and a New York BBQ legend (Adam Perry Lang) \u00a0what could possibly go wrong? Well, in my experience, NOTHING! Barbecoa was a splendid place to visit \u00a0right from the moment we set down on the snaking liver-pink bench seats (can you describe furniture as having an intestinal motif?) opposite a stunning view of St Paul's dome, right through to sipping on a glorious Noah's Mill bourbon. And the message of this place is: MEAT. Messrs Oliver & Lang have set the kitchen up to use as little electricity as possible, instead making use of wood & charcoal to imbue the excellent butchery with brilliant smoky flavours. A visit's not cheap mind, although not crippling if you're careful. Our lunch came to about \u00a370: the bread selection was the most visual dish by far, with the crispy sesame flatbread giving a radar-dish feel to the arrangement. Such tasty, tasty bread. Fans of ribs will enjoy the rib starter too \u00a0a surprisingly generous portion, basted in one of Barbecoa's freshly-produced sauces. Those were some mighty fine ribs, and no mistake. For mains we enjoyed a superb burger (think Byron, but good), and a lamb chop from the specials board. I'm not someone who rhapsodises about lamb but after tasting this I could suddenly understand why people would. The wine list is encyclopaedic ranging from keenly priced to frankly, ludicrous \u00a0but the looming cathedral reminds us we're in the Square Mile, and this sort of thing shouldn't be surprising. Beer fans will be pleased to see a perfectly formed list of bottled beers (assembled by London's famed beer writer, Melissa Cole!), and bar manager Dawid Steenkamp's hand-picked whisky list is a thing of beauty.",

Being a guy at a table full of girls is usually a good thing in my opinion...except when I get relegated to the single hard wood seat facing the rest of the gang. To top it off, Gordon Ramsey saunters in (Jamie wasn't around which meant no fantasy top chef cookoff) and sits right behind me so I couldn't even watch in awe. Ah well, if it was Heston I would have been proper pissed.Anyways, I digress. To the main point, the food that is. Get the bread...and the olives...but especially the bread. The display is innovative and entertaining as the chunks of various breads are impaled on a wooden spear in a twisted tower. The crispy slightly garlicky bread was a great starter although my favourite was the dark rye with molasses. The massive olives on ice are very mild and refreshing and enjoyable even to an olive hater like myself.The mains were satisfying although I did give into my cravings and got the burger which as juicy and large enough to meet even my American-sized demands. The other mains ordered looked just as enticing and ensured no one had food envy.As we were there for my friend's birthday, we had brought in a cake from Konditor & Cook (carrot cake...absolutely incredible...try it) and our waitress was kind enough to sneak it to the kitchen, plate it, and bring it over candles and all to the horrendous screeching we called singing. They even lent us the use of a Global knife to do the honours without any fuss at us not ordering from their dessert menu. Definitely bonus points in my book.The price is a bit on the high side as you would expect but overall a great dining experience made it good value for money.One more quick note...I will be interested to see how things change when Ramsey's new place opens up directly opposite.",

    "text": "'Monkey face' they call it in Nepal.A special kind of sneer.As in, your mum tells you to eat your greens, you sneer, she says...\"don't give me monkey face\".Anyway, monkey face is what I got when I told people I was off to Barbacoa.Maybe it was the Jamie Oliver effect. Unfair. But many people don't seem to like him.Maybe it was the city location. Unfair as you get the most resplendant views of our very own Cathedral of St Pauls.MAybe it was the reviews. There certainly have been some bad ones since it opened.Well, I wasn't paying and I was going with a great group so, with my own best monkey face...\"bovvered?\".Set inside a somewhat unpromising modern mall, the place itself is thoroughly modern too. Lots of sculptured iron all over the gaff and big wall to ceiling windows which, if you're seated in the right space, do give you fantastic views of Mr Wren's Crib.Very modern. Not cheap I would imagine. A cool look, if you like that sort of thing.We got a boothed table with comfy bench seats and an impossibly large leather slate menu with which I broke a glass immediately. Clumsy fool.The menu is simplicity itself. A few starters. some choices from the grill or the wood oven. And a few puddings. \u00a0But in terms of meat, it was all there. Lamb, chicken, beef, pork. You are left in no doubt this is a meat feast.Interesting stuff too. Pulled pork, pit beef, short rib, all the usual steaks, a burger. Something for the more adventurous or the complete scaredy-cat. I went sea bass ceviche followed by chateaubriand, which I was made to share with my missus.Ceviche was about average. Not enough and a little too sour, not enough balance. The missus had a crab and avacado salad. Trade descriptions issues here. One tiny cube of avacado. But I guess rather scrimp on that than the crab. It was done nicely enough (although again, she wouldn't have minded more) but each mouthful came with shell, in some cases big bits. This is just clumsy for the price. Shame.But the mains were a different story.I have to report, the chateaubriand was nothing short of sensational. Wildly seasoned on the outside, melting meat millimeters within. I don't think I've tasted much better meat anywhere. Seriously. It came with goose fat chips which were a little leathery, spinach topped with breadcrumbs which was a little bland, garlic mash which was a little too 'raw' tasting, and reasonable carrot and swede (don't know what 'clapshot' means but the hint of orange was a nice touch).But anyway. Back to the meat.Tender mouthfuls of juicy morsels just screaming to be eaten. Loads of it too. Greedy guts here hoovered up all leftovers too and can report that the filet was great.Not one of us left denying the meat had been a real experience. As I write this next day I am suffering the meat sweats along with the alcohol from decent chianti and Montbazillac (which accompanied respectful sweets ordered out of sheer greed.) Again, nothing special there. But back to the meat.Rich tender chunks of animals who must have been pampered like babies every day they were reared for my enjoyment.Atmos, buzzy. Service, efficient and friendly enough. Prices, extravagent. etc etc etc. This place gets a rather heafty four stars from me but to be clear, this is for absolutely nothing other than the completely sumptuous animal matter. The meat drags this from 2/3 stars to the heady heights. It's that good.Anyway, back to the meat........",

Combine the obvious attention to detail and quality of meaty ingredients with the enviable location opposite St Pauls and the understated relaxed elegance of the dining room, and Barbecoa is looking like something really special. So what went wrong? Well, the food was very nice but not sparklingly good, and certainly not deserving of the hefty city price-tags. The baby back ribs were clumsily over-spiced and the appetiser pork scratchings rather dull and lacking in flavour. Mains-wise the beef short rib was begging for a sauce and the pork belly, though beautifully cooked, was under-seasoned. We didn't do desserts or booze apart from one glass of overpriced Malbec and still managed to spend \u00a3140 for 4. Ouch. Want ribs? Go to Bodeans. Want steaks? Hawksmoor. Give this place a miss, as you'll come out full but disappointed.",

    "text": "A group of us decided to some here after reading good reviews. Unfortunately, we were all pretty disappointed.Pros: Nice decor, good appetizers, certain mains were delicious like the short ribs and the brownie dessert. However, the list ends here.Cons: Cocktails and desserts were NOT good. I asked the server for a strong bitter cocktail and I got some watered down whiskey and gin. Got a gin at the end of the evening which was also watery. The peanut butter cheesecake dessert was just mousse, mostly cream with a hint of peanut butter which is not what I call a cheesecake. My friend got what tasted like frozen yogurt but was frozen to the point where the yogurt comes off as chunks. The brownie apparently was good though. The service which wasn't that great and a bit strange. First, at the bar, my boyfriend ordered a Boulevardier which is a pretty standard drink and the server said the bartender didn't know how to make it which was rather odd (later she retracted the statement and did end up giving us the drink). During our meal, our server at the table felt the need to explain to some of us why she asked our friend to cut into his steak (it was to make sure the steak was done to his taste) which was unnecessary and irrelevant. While she explained that some of our orders were possibly mixed up because one person moved into an empty seat (in which case everyone else should have gotten their plates except that one person) but instead, our plates were all over the place and disorganized. That also wasn't a good enough reason to explain why most of our steaks were more well done than what we had ordered - the rares were medium rare, medium rares were medium and the one medium steak at the table was on the well done side. At the end of the meal when they were clearing plates, my boyfriend already told one server that he wasn't finished and maybe 5 minutes later, someone else tried to clear his plate when he clearly wasn't done.All in all, it was weird service and I most definitely would not come back. There are other places that serve good food without the confusion of services and bad cocktails and desserts.",

    "text": "Barbecoa is the steakhouse created as a joint venture between Jamie Oliver and Adam Perry Lang. Frankly i would have loved to have been able to estimate the contribution of each of them to the food that is served here, but i do not have sufficient qualifications for that yet. Its located at One New Change, which is quite close to my flat as well as my office. So i knew that i would be trying it out sometime soon, and i got the chance last week. Barbecoa'a location at one of London's pre-eminent tourist spots seems to be a bit of a waste. Its pricey. I can't imagine that there would be many walk-in customers from among the foreigners visiting St Paul's.The menu is somewhat limited. I ordered chicken liver on toast as a starter. It was satisfactory. For my main course I went for the sirloin steak with mushrooms on a bed of rosemary sauce. Initially I was disappointed since I did not have the choice of the sauce (I love bearnaise ). However that feeling lasted only till the arrival of the food. It was brilliant. The steak was very well cooked and the mushrooms were tender. The sauce complemented the meat perfectly. The piece that I got had a bit of hard skin on it but that did not compromise its quality by too much. For those of you who would not want to indulge themselves with a steak, you can have something from a selection of burgers, ribs and such other meat dishes. Barbecoa has a less extensive wine list than most of its competitors (in the sense that it's wine list does not run into hundreds of pages :) ). But the selection available proved to be enough for an amateur like me. It's an expensive restaurant and the bill can easily exceed \u00a350 per person. It would be a nice place for a professional meal for bankers working in the area. I would recommend Barbecoa to my boss as the location for our next team dinner :)",

(Owners are Jamie Oliver & Adam Perry Lang).Great view of St Pauls - so a good place to take cashed up tourists!Great drinks menu(Margarita's were divine!) The choice of starters is pretty diverse, the chicken liver was to die for! Pork scratching was nice and the bread basket had a nice mix of different cuts of bread. I thought the olives were overpriced (\u00a34 for a few large green olives over ice).Oh, the chips are cooked in duck fat! Yummo! (pretty filling & rich though).All the mains looked nice, I had the Pit Beef which was gorgeous! The pulled pork was pretty good too! The portions don't look big but they are all pretty filling...(I took half my main home!).Overall, \u00a0a good place to go to if you are after a nice BBQ fix.I hope to see a trend of more places like it in London but at more reasonable prices.",

A waitress provided my daughter with crayons and paper and added an evenings worth of playful, though not intrusive, entertainment. As for the food, overall, it was very good. The one significant disappointment was the short rib, although it was perfectly cooked , good quality meat and fall off the bone tender, the flavour was a bit lacking - a side sauce would have been a welcome addition. I tried to add some flavour by piling on cole slaw - not ideal, but better then the alternative. We started with the perfectly fried and tender calamari which was served on a bed of guacamole - excellent - and the baby back ribs - excellent as well with a touch of spice from slivers of red and green jalape\u00f1os. We also had the ceviche which was very good - light and refreshing. In addition to the short rib, we had the pulled pork - with a delicious BBQ sauce and a smoky flavour(was liquid smoke used?). We also had the duck fat fries - which were okay. For dessert we had a deconstructed lemon meringue pie - eh. My daughter enjoyed her white chocolate and dark chocolate ice cream (with a special treat - thank you kind waitress).Overall a very good meal and the view of St Paul's was spectacular. The clubby vibe was fine - very different from the vibe at Daisy Mae's in NYC \u00a0- Adam Lang Perry's other restaurant, but they are very different restaurants. I have heard that the burger is very good and I will try it next time(if there is a next time). By the way, for all the food described above as well as 4 bottles of beer the cost was about 125 - a bit spendey.",

We couldn't get a table before 9:30. \u00a0We ended up waiting until 10, and in that span were brought a bottle of prosecco, the house-cured olives, and the pork cracklins (there's a different name, but they're essentially pork rinds). \u00a0They really tout these on their bar snacks menu, but I didn't care for either very much. \u00a0When we got to the table, I ordered three plates of the chicken wings (for the 6 of us) they were gone in a flash.They had a tri-tip steak special, so I ordered that. \u00a0It was good but not great. \u00a0Great was the gigantic beef short rib the rest of the table enjoyed. \u00a0I drank a Maple Treacle as an opener. \u00a0Also excellent, then we moved on to a round of Blazers for the table. \u00a0Ambience is very modern. \u00a0low cozy large booths, giant \u00a0\"birdcages\" or small tables. Stunning light fixtures. \u00a0Service is excellent. \u00a0I will find any excuse to get back to London to get there.",
