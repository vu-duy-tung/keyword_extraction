    "text": "North Sea is the place where I was introduced to a proper Fish and Chips. We managed to catch North Sea minutes before the restaurant opens, which meant a trip right next door to their takeaway. If you're looking for a quick fix of fish & chips, the takeaway and not the restaurant is the way to go.I'm not a snob when it comes to breaded and fried fish as you could put a case of Van De Kamps in front of me and I'd have a whale of a time. However, I had great expectations for North Sea in London and fish & chips in general for that matter and still they managed to deliver in a big way.Their fish is huge, an actual fish fried on top of chips or steak fries as we call them in the States. We had the cod and the haddock and the taste test revealed the cod to be overall more tasty than the haddock. Still, both fish were a beautiful combination of fresh fish meat, the perfect heat, and the right amount of crisp in every bite. The chips? Well, they give you an entire funnel of them and the paper they wrap it in soaks up all the oil so you retain the texture of the fries as you eat your massive fish. That said, the fries could have been more crispy. The fish is the real star and fortunately I didn't come across any bones in my haddock. The cod had a few. It's definitely filling and worth every pound. Get it with tartar sauce (only 50 pence) and sit outside on their bench to enjoy.In nautical terms, getting the fish and chips at North Sea is like catching the 'big one,' and I'd recommend casting your line there as soon as you can.",

It was conveniently located down the street from our hotel, so after our first (tiring) day in London, we settled down to a nice meal of f&c. They have several fish choices for your fish and chips- haddock, cod, salmon, form what I remember. The piece of fish they serve you is huge, and quite substantial for one person (I could have probably split one with someone!). The chips were crisp and thick, and when doused with vinegar and dipped in tartar sauce were phenomenal. Anyway, it was yummy intro to British food, and along with waters and a beer, it came out to be a bit over 50 pounds. Of course, dining out in London is quite expensive, but this was reasonable. The ambiance is very old school",

We barely snuck in at 1:40pm before their 2pm close time for their sit down restaurant and ordered the smoked haddock (so good!) as an appetizer so that we would not have an entire meal that was deep fried, haha. The we shared a large potion of fish and chips. To my surprise, instead of being many pieces of battered and fried fish, the entire fillet comes out as one huge piece! Fresh, fragrant, and steaming, not overly oily. The chips were pretty standard large cut fries, but with ketchup and malt vinegar they were the perfect accompaniment. :) About 30 pounds fed both of us a very nice, sit down lunch. (We were the only tourists and an older lady laughed at us for taking pictures with the food, haha.)",

I have been coming here since I was young, and for me I just get a feeling of comfort as it's a place which reminds me of when I used to come to London with my parents during my summer holidays. \u00a0However, even if it is your first time, the place simply engulfs you with a sense of familiarity and ease, and this could be due to the fact that not only is it unpretentious in anyway (except for maybe one of the waitresses who works there who can from time to time be quite off!), North Sea has been run and belongs to the same family since it first opened in 1977. This joint first started as a local fish and chip shop, but due to its popularity, and quite rightly so, it is now a restaurant with a take-away establishment right next door. The menu a nice array of fish, which you can have cooked in various ways, so as not to limit one to the usual battered fish. I last had grilled cod and chips with mushy peas. The cod was just the right texture, the chips were chunky and the peas where hot and the right kind of mushy! By the way, the portions are huge so unless you can handle it, I would recommend sharing the large portion of chips and sides they give you! Eating fish and chips at the restaurant itself is not the cheapest, but the quality and overall ambiance all put together is very pleasant.",

Now that we're working in central London we have more opportunities than just eating the food at the terrible canteen. I found North Sea and thought we should venture a bit further out to try some place new for Fish and Chips as the ones close by seem to be hit or miss sometimes. Fish and Chips places can be busy, so I was worried that there wouldn't be seated, but there's actually a huge dining space in the back of the restaurant. Which was a bit of a downfall because we got forgotten about a few times during lunch.The five of us ordered the fish and chips. So the fish was really tasty and crispy and the chips were amazingly crisp and delicious. They have homemade tartare sauce, and it was one of the best I've had. They weirdly serve the chips in baskets to share between two people. I'm not sure what that's about. Since there was an odd number of us, I got my own basket, so I didn't care.Unfortunately if you choose to eat in, it's a bit expensive. I wouldn't mind paying the price for a dinner out, but for lunch, it's unlikely I'll go back.",

The cod fish that I had was flaky, tasty, fresh and pipping hot. \u00a0The restaurant itself was cozy and clean but the service was a-ok. The waitress gave off the vibe that she does not want to be there and was mostly on her cellphone texting/browsing the internet. It definitely dampen my experience but I was at least satisfied with my food. I will definitely come back or bring visiting friends and relatives here if they ask for good fish and chips.",

    "text": "This is my 150th review and my first London review, and what better way to start by reviewing a place that serves an icon of British cuisine for the past 100 years or so: Fish and Chips. Located in the Bloomsbury neighbourhood of London, this place is divided into two sections, the restaurant section and a section for take away. My friend, his roommate and I went to the take away section because I noticed that getting fish and chips is cheaper.We got some Fried Cod and a good portion of Chips to share among ourselves. Since my friend's roommate is a devout Muslim from Oman, he wanted to make sure that the fish was prepared \"halal\" (he was very adamant about it), so we asked if they could prepare it \"halal\". The staff over there seemed to be happy and obliged to do so, but we had to wait longer compared to the typical patrons who wanted to get take away. So if you are Muslim, and want \"halal\" Fish and Chips, this is also a good option. After getting the fish and chips, I put some vinegar and salt on them, and started to eat. The fried fish was pretty tasty, the batter on the outside had a nice good crisp, while the fish itself was soft, and could be tastier with the Tartar Sauce. As for the chips, they were also pretty tasty. With the salt, the chips also had a good crisp that would make the chips almost addicting to eat. They use a lot of paper, which is supposedly the traditional way to wrap up Fish and Chips. The paper is fairly thick, so it's pretty good at absorbing the grease.Overall, this is a pretty good place to get some tasty Fish and Chips in London, and I would definitely come back to grab some good take away. And I did not have to spend more than \u00a37 for a generous helping.",

It's a beautiful thing, and its cooked well, never overcooked. Get the haddock, you will not be disappointed! The atmosphere is a little bizarre but when it's busy it has a really quaint feel to it. They also have a to go place next door if you do not feel like sitting down.Also, best tartare sauce in the world!",

The chips are your standard steak fries and definitely need salt, vinegar and/or ketchup for extra flavor.

    "text": "We are in London so common sense requires us to go get fish and chips, fast. Destiny demands, we obey. Those are the simple lines of reasoning that can lead you to the best places, which themselves have crystal clear guidelines too ; for the North Sea Fish the motto is pure and perfect : \"let's cook fish and chips but not with poor lonesome fillet but with quality WHOLE fish\". As a total newbie of fish and chips - who has only in her sad existence came across pathetic pretence of them, - I was delighted by this superb food experience. The fish was delicious, well cooked and of high quality, not some Captain Cook fillet (oh what a newbie I am to invoke Captain Cook name along those sacred lines). The chips were really savory. Plus the sauce : three different types are brought to you (including a tartare sauce) so that you have the choice and they all are very tasty as well.So, was it greasy? You bet it was. What else to expect? But it was a delicious taste of fat. The fried breading was almost light (yep). But I need to admit that I was not able to finish my truly enormous dish, it is not only that I was not hungry anymore because I went far beyond that limit, I just could not physically eat anymore. Even the male company could not finish. Do not fear to leave the place hungry, rather fear that the place might eat you alive.Oh and the surroundings? I was so focused on the enormous fish that I did not pay much attention but it was quite nice, very British. And the service was very nice.",

The fries were a bit soft for my liking; especially, in comparison to the \u00a0crunchiness of the fish.The presentation was unique. I asked for it to be open so that I could eat it as we walked (as opposed to closed). They made a cone out of the paper that would have been used to wrap the fish if I had asked for it to be closed. A large chunk of fries was thrown into this cone, and it was topped off by the fish plumped on top.",

It was basically fried in batter, but it was light, crispy and not oily at all. The batter puffs up so it looks like your portion of fish is HUGE, but it's not, the regular portion is just big enough to satisfy a standard hunger. Side spinach, coleslaw and pickled onion were all good. They also serve everything with ketchup bowl and tartar sauce bowl - free of charge.The service was friendly and very attentive (it helped that we were the only people in the restaurant! - it was their first opening on a Sunday). I liked the ambiance of the place - very cozy, wooden furniture, dark red seating - good space.I just wish it was a tad bit cheaper - it's twice/thrice more expensive comparing to its sister take-out next door.",

For one thing, it was served so hot that after ten minutes into cutting into it, I still burnt my mouth when I took a bite, to the point of instant blistering. The taste was just ok. There was an odd spice in it that just didn't sit right with me. My friend had the sea bass that came recommended. He said he's had much better, and the side of boiled potatoes had no flavor. My fianc\u00e9 had the fish and chips (cod). He was served a huge portion, but I tasted it and thought it was just good, not great. Honestly the best thing we tasted were the chips.

I don't recommend getting the large as I didn't see much different in size between the small and the large.Cod: GF found some tiny bones in the cod, so she didn't seem to enjoy it.Haddock: Wow this thing was amazing. The fish was overly oily, which made the fish fry/batter lose some crispiness, but it was still super yummy. I could definitely feel the fats and oils settling in while I ate. Still would recommend this place.Fries: Can't so no to bottomless fries now can I?",

    "text": "This was on several best of lists for fish and chips in London so the bf and I decided to check it out. I got the haddock while he got the cod. There were a few tiny bones in both which made me kinda paranoid the rest of the meal but nothing large enough to leave a mark. The chips are unlimited but after our first serving we were already full-- they were also DELICIOUS!!!If I could redo the experience I probably would have tried a different type of fish. However since haddock is the typical go to for fish and chips I figured it was the way to go. This was a tad pricey but the area is far from a typical pub setting. I'm sure there is type of fish that could push my rating up!",

We showed up right before they closed to prep between lunch and dinner so the sit down area was quiet. People were stopping by already to reserve tables for dinner and the takeaway was busy the whole time we ate. My husband and I ordered the jumbo order of fried haddock and fries. Apparently the fries are endless but we were so full from the massive filet of fish we didn't need it. The fish was friend with the skin on still which was interesting and it was perfectly crispy and juicy. The fries were piping hot and delicious. The tarter sauce had a good bite to it but I found I liked the fish best with just some lemon and a dash of vinegar. Service was polite and I can't speak to the vibe because of the time of day. Across the street there's a pub that was popular and could be good for pre/post dinner drinks.",

You can actually get whole fish on the bone (woo hoo!), either battered or grilled. I got the grilled lemon sole which was a monster whole fish that was perfectly cooked. No dry overcooked fish here! The main drawback here is the service. We got a few smiles from a couple of the waitstaff but it's mostly surly, grumpy, 'why are you bothering me' attitudes. \u00a0The back room also got uncomfortably warm.

Two couples were turned away in front of us as well. The restaurant looked nice and traditional inside. Just next door is their take away location, which is apparently much cheaper than their eat in menu. We ordered cod and haddock, as well as chips. They had chips and a few pieces of fried fish available and ready for purchase but we had to wait 15 minutes while they prepared and fried our cod and haddock. This was worth the wait as the fish was piping hot when we got it. We didn't want to walk all the way to our hotel so we ate it sitting on a small bench right outside the restaurant.During the 20 minutes we were eating, there were probably 30 people coming in and out to order take away. Some locals ordered just chips, which they had the option of adding salt to. We ate the cod first, which was very meaty and tender. We knew the fish was fresh and not frozen by the way the meat was falling off each other. The haddock had a much fishier taste and less tender than the cod. I'm glad we got a chance to eat both. The chips were so good!",

They have the classic cod fish, but the menu here is vast with tons of great options. You're going to have a hard time selecting between all their amazing fish choices. I wouldn't call this a \"fish and chips\" restaurant, but a solid seafood restaurant. The serving sizes here are ample. More than ample, huge. I opted for the classic cod and chips. It was perfectly fried and tender. I couldn't finish my fish and I barely made a dent in my chips because there was so much. It didn't help that we also had a couple of their appetizers to begin with: homemade fish cake and the deep fried brie. Both absolutely delicious. My sweet side craving a little something something, I opted for the trifle. It was good, but didn't blow my mind. It was my first time eating trifle, though, so this may just be a dessert that I'm not crazy about. Service was great. Friendly and knowledgeable staff willing to answer any questions us Americans had about traditional English food. I would most definitely recommend to any seafood lover.",

It's often busy but the queues are always small and service is very quick and efficient. As chips go they're much better than any from a fast food outlet (even Burger King chips) and the portions are always very healthy. The chips are frozen and not freshly prepared but some of the best in this field. I've tasted the fish and I haven't always been happy - sometimes soggy and falling apart but the sausages is always good. If your live or are staying nearby its well worth the visit but perhaps not worth travelling if you don't.",

North Sea Fish is not a simple Fish and chips. You can call it a fish restaurant. It really deserves it. They've got a huge fish menu. All fish are freshly caught. My friend Piotr had a sea bass in a sorrel sauce. I had a grilled jumbo sized plaice with tartar sauce... and French fries of course. Everything was delicious and fresh. As a dessert we ordered a pineapple pudding and a cr\u00e8me caramel. The pudding was kind of exotic but nothing to remember of. The cr\u00e8me caramel though reminded me my childhood and I'm thankful for that. The d\u00e9cor is full of nostalgia with its wood-paneled bar and its cheap serviettes. Our polish middle-aged waitress was very kind and professional. It's located not far from the British Museum. I think it's a nice place to have lunch.

Sure, they had salmon and sea bass but I figured I would go with one of the classics.Batter wasn't very heavy, it was the perfect amount. The chips were nice and crisp, but soft in the middle (just the way I like it). The homemade tartar sauce was oh-so-good, mix with a little malt vinegar, and I was in heaven!If you don't feel like dining in, there's takeaway located right next door. Service is good but nonchalant. Even though this was the only place we came to for fish & chips while in London, I can say that it was a favorite.

A tip for future visitors, check what time you head here since it is closed for a couple hours between lunch and dinner. \u00a0I happened to come during this closed period, but knew I wanted it bad enough that I walked all the way back on another day.Yelp has not let me down. \u00a0This place was amazingly delicious. \u00a0The fish itself was very large, probably the length of my forearm. \u00a0The breading was thin and light, and not shiny from grease. \u00a0The taste was over the top that it didn't need any sauce to make it edible, however, their tarter is freshly made, so even that had an outstanding taste you just cant pass \u00a0it up. \u00a0Half way done, I was already stuffed, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating! \u00a0Even the fries were good.The only problem was the fact that take away is so much cheaper that we decided to take it to go, however it's difficult to walk and enjoy at the same time. \u00a0Specially in the middle of winter with a very brisk wind and there is no where near the area to just sit and enjoy the food. We ended up eating in the cold (luckily the food was so hot that it off set how cold I felt) against the side of a building. \u00a0Even with this balancing act of ketchup, fries, fish and tarter sauce in a paper cone while walking in the cold, I would most defiantly go back and do it all over again.BOTTOM LINE: must go!!! the fish and chips are delicious! only problem is take away is so much cheaper it's hard to want to sit down and pay the extra price, which means you must be good at multitasking with eating and walking.",

As soon as we were comfortably seated at a four-top, the hostess asked us to move to a cramped two-top next to a mother and child; my boyfriend refused, as the hostess had already seated us at the four-top. Also, we're not fond of other people's children. The hostess was kind of pissy about it, so I'm taking away a star for that.

    "text": "Thanks to some London foodies' recommendations on Tripadvisor, my husband and I had a chance to try this place. By far it is the best fish 'n chips we had in London near Bloomsbury! You can tell right away that most of the customers are locals from the area and not many of tourists (at least for the night we were there), That was a very good sign to us. It was very packed so do expect that it will take longer for the food to come up. My husband ordered baked potato pie with smoked Haddock (14 BGP) \u00a0and I just ordered a regular cod fish 'n chips(18 GBP). The fish was fried to perfection and you can choose to have it breaded in batter or matzo flakes. The fish is moist inside the breaded batter and I think the regular size is more than enough for most lady customers. There are a few tiny bones in the fish but it didn't bother us at all. The chips (aka french fries) are decent but a little bit on the soggy side; not sure if it's because they are so busy the night we were there. My husband LOVED smoke haddock. It was super delicious!!! He loved the creaminess of the potato that was layered above the smoked haddock. You can taste the smokey flavor of the fish throughout the dish. I also ordered a side order of French bread and butter. The bread came slightly toasted and the butter was whippy enough to spread on the bread easily. Green peas was also served and the portion was quite decent for 2 people (unless you are crazy about \u00a0green peas, you can probably finish it all). The service is decent/standard. You are not gonna get a too chatty waitress there I think, because they are just too busy. \u00a0I do think \u00a0they expect some tipping, which my husband and I weren't sure about doing until I come back and re-read our travel guidebook. Thus, based on the quality of food, 10-15% tips would be good to show your appreciation of the food. Lastly, they do have some great dessert menu; we would've tried the white chocolate creme brulee if we weren't stuffed from all the yummy courses we had...but we are definitely going back once again before we leave!",

I figured I had to try the Mushy Peas, since it seems to be a British thing (they tasted like mushy peas...surprised?), I wouldn't order them again, but I had to try them once. The Brussels sprouts were pretty good, steamed with butter on them. The restaurant had good tartar sauce & pleasant service.I don't think I would go back, especially since I've had enough fish & chips already for the 10 days I am in London, but a pretty decent place to get fish & chips if you are in the neighborhood.

While everyone else seems to enjoy a beer with their plate, a glass of scotch whiskey does the trick as well.",

    "text": "Out-dated deco,the staff hardly speaks English and watch and stare as you eat your food. Don'tturn up within one hour or less to closing as it clearly annoys the waitresses,which reflects in the way you are treated. It can be only described as a poshchippy with terrible place mats. The food is actually really nice, good piecesof fish but almost double the price as the chip shop next door. Stronglyrecommend for the food from the chip shop next door, which is still part of therestaurant but you can leave straight away rather than eating your meal with aside order of judgement.",
