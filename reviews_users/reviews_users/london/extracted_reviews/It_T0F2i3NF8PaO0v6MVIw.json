    "text": "This is an OK place for Ramen.Ambience: very busy and buzzing which is a good sign. It has a small space upstairs but more spaces on the ground floor. Food: Good size portion. My fiance wasn't too keen on the rice when he ordered the curry but the sauce was good and so was the Kara-Age chicken. The Ittenbari Ramen was lovely too but it only came with 1 slice of pork... a bit tight with their meat. Wouldn't mind if there were some veg to go along with it too (ie, seaweed or carrots etc). The Goyza wasn't what I expected and I had better before.Price: They only take cash. The price is ok for it's portion so I'm not complaining in that department.My brother enjoys this place but I'm not too sure of it. I will only return if someone else wants to eat here. Otherwise I'm happy trying out other places.",

    "text": "Walking into Ittenbari made me feel instantly at ease. The decor reminded me of the casual quick noodle bars dotted around mong kok in hong kong, just relaxed and comforting. \u00a0The ramen was not superb but it wasn't too awful either. I felt it was too big a portion for \u00a0me to finish and the ramen noodles were much nicer than other soho ramen places. It might have been four stars but the egg was too hard, for me the egg in ramen should always be soft and a little bit runny. Also, as others have mentioned.. where was the nori? The lack of nori was unsettling but my barley tea was lovely so there were pros and cons. Will be back for another visit to decide how I feel about Ittenbari.",

    "text": "I first sampled Ittenbari's ramen at the Hyper Japan convention in 2011, and I was hooked from the first bowlful. \u00a0I have been a fan of Japanese cuisine for some time, and been visiting Ittenbari off and on since they opened. \u00a0I always order the Ittenbari Ramen, Deluxe (for the extra pork!!), with a bottle of Asahi Black (I love this beer!). \u00a0The broth is light but flavourful, the pork is cooked to perfection, beautifully tender to the point where it almosts melts in your mouth. \u00a0The accompanying vegetables (wilted spinach, bamboo shoots, spring onions and a small amount of caramalised onion) are cooked well, and provide extra flavour and texture to the dish.The noodles, which deserve an entire paragraph to themselves, are amazing. \u00a0Made on site, these have to be the best ramen noodles I have ever tasted. \u00a0Firm yet chewy, they take on the flavour of the broth without becoming soggy and mushy. \u00a0I always go back for extra, which is a feature I like of Ittenbari. \u00a0If you manage to finish your ramen, have broth left, and are still hungry, for an extra \u00a31.30 (I think!) they will give you an extra portion of noodles!!!!The ambience of the restaurant is also worthy of note. \u00a0Very no frills and minimal, the seating can be a little cramped when it's busy, but is otherwise fine. \u00a0It has a very casual feel to it which I really enjoy, more akin to a cafe than an actual restaurant.I would definatly recommend it anyone, except my enemies!",

    "text": "Recently went back to Ittenbari for the third time, on this occasion with gf in tow. Previous two meals there had been encouraging: ramen was great, service was good, restaurant clean. This time however wasn't so inspiring. My girlfriend's food came first: the soup was pretty greasy, the hard boiled egg floating in the middle of the soup overcooked. Before receiving my food however, I had an inexplicable half an hour wait. Literally, half an hour. Why there was a half an hour gap between serving two bowls of the same soup is anybody's guess. I received various excuses - the waitress mistook the order, the chef screwed up etc. etc. When it finally arrived, I did enjoy it. Maybe they made a fresh batch, because it was certainly a lot fresher and less greasy than my gf's. They did redeem themselves somewhat by compensating, giving us each a free drink (coke) and were apologetic for the errors. I appreciate that these things happen, but it was just a shame considering the previous times I had been there it was so good. I was really looking forward to going back. Not sure I'll return so quickly.",

    "text": "Although London has a fantastic array of restaurants, I've never been able to find an authentic ramen shop. I think my search might be over.Arrived on a Sunday at 1 in the afternoon to find a short queue ahead of us, which is always a good sign. After 10-15 minutes, our orders were taken and we were ushered into the restaurant. It was a bit strange to find the restaurant only half full after having to queue...The shio ramen broth is light and the noodles are thin and very chewy; just like a good bowl of ramen should be (for those who prefer the rich dense Hokkaido-style ramen, I'm afraid you'll probably be disappointed). The pork was tasty BUT major downside is that you only get ONE wafer-thin piece, and half an egg! Although I enjoyed my ramen I would only give Ittenbari 3 1/2 stars. Reasons? Service could be better, more generous servings of pork for the price. PS: please get rid of the \u00a320 minimum for cards!",

I had the ittenbari ramen and the egg was actually half cold, and partially medium boiled and hard boiled. The ingredients were alright, but weren't anything more than the average few things shops throw into ramen. The gyoza fillings were soft and were a far cry from the consistency of gyoza you could find on the streets of Japan. The edamame was fine, but they're beans, nobody can get that wrong. All in all the dinner did it's job, it got me full. I would recommend this place for a cheap (depends on your definition) enough meal in that area that's tasty enough, but don't expect to be blown away ( unless it's your first time eating japanese food).",

    "text": "There were a good mix of Japanese and European faces filling the utilitarian tables and the queues outside as we left were as long as those outside previous noodle-magnet Koya. With plenty of spaces in the noodle bars next door and around 'little Japan' it would appear that somehow this new Brewer Street addition is engendering the same fanaticism that Koya manages. So what is it with this noodley obsession in London, and what is it specifically with Ittenbari? Ramen is like chicken soup for the Japanese soul. A big bowl of steaming handmade udon noodles lurk like deep sea cables in a fragrant pool of umami rich seaspiced broth ripe with veg, pork and a perfectly cooked egg. Simple, egalitarian and delicious. This is the food of Gods, and a workday lunch for most of Japan, the lucky bastards. Despite the posters announcing a new opening, it doesn't look like they've decorated in years. The grafitti on the back of the loo door is historic and the decor chipped. What is new it would seem is the ownership. Now the London outpost of a renowned Osakan institution, imagine the frenetic foodie buzz if Russell Norman opened Polpo Tokyo and you might come close.  It's difficult and naive for this knowless gaijin to pass judgement on the actual noodles. I'll let the photo of the crowds streaming down the street at the lunch service do that. Was it the finest lunch i've had in my life? No, but it genuinely came close As a fulfilling, tasty meal, I can safely say that it's hard to beat.",

I guess they lack the staff to properly service the upstairs section or are trying to limit the number of people to create the illusion of a popular venue, like how most clubs in London operate. We all ordered the shoyu ramen and surprised at the size of the portion. For the non-deluxe version you only get one slice of pork and half an egg so if you're hungry, either go for a rice dish or a large which will set you back at over \u00a310. For this price, I don't think it's good value for money although the ramen was quite good and tasted authentic. Gyoza was quite good also. Service was a bit lacking as we had to go downstairs to get our change as the waiter had forgotten about us. The table next to us also had one dish that arrived much later than everyone's. I probably wouldn't go here again unless they reduced the price on their ramen. If I wanted noodles I'd rather go for vietnamese pho which is probably more fulfilling. Not worth the long wait.",

If you're looking for a fancy sushi restaurant, this is not your place. What you'll find here is a lot of Japanese people, many eating alone, with a simple meal of comfort food: Chicken or pork katsu, katsu curry, ramen, chashu don, etc.Think warming bowl food. While I have had the karaage curry, and it was decent, the star here is the ramen. Both the soy sauce based (shoyu ramen) and miso ramen (my personal favourite) are excellent. Though the miso ramen has a touch of marmite in it, never fear, it does not taste like it at all. Trust me, it just works. This is a different beast from a place like Bone Daddies (which is way trendier, a thicker broth, more 'goodies', etc.), what Ittenbari does, it does simply and well. An excellent weeknight dinner.",

The broth I would say is chinese-infused (perhaps MSG added, not confirmed), it's close to some kind of \"y\u00e1ng chun mi\u00e0n\" soup base, and it's one of the few ramen shops I've visited using shallot confit, which complements the broth. Nothing much to say about the noodle, it was an \"ok\". My portion of egg was over cooked (yolk wasn't runny but still soft), and the flavor of the egg could have been better if it was stronger, maybe it didn't get soaked in the \"sauce\" (which was used after boiling the egg) long enough. High lights and notes : - Tables were relatively low for eating.",

Though the table was a bit on the dirty side... but of course I had my own hand sanitizer so it's all OK (wish they had better chopsticks -- the bamboo disposable chopsticks are much better for ramen!)Now the food. I had the Ittenbari Ramen. The broth was flavorful. I couldn't exactly taste the clams and seafood they claimed they put in there. I would've liked to try it without MSG. The egg and ramen were average. The pork slice was very tender and it's giant. I can't imagine ordering the plus size portion because the average was more than sufficient.Overall, I think I still prefer tonkosu ramen at Shoyru or Bone Daddy in that neck of the hood. but ittenbari wasn't bad at all! It also helped that there was this guy with super cute dimples sitting a few tables across from me while I was devouring my ramen. So I'm giving this place an A-OK! :)",

    "text": "You know you're on to a winner when there's a massive queue reaching out the door all the time that you're there. Though I'm quite struck by Jeremy L's report of being ushered to an empty part of the restaurant after finally having made it to the front of the queue.. Anyways:I'm not an expert on Ramen, more someone seeking to learn about its mysterious ways through osmosis and the far more knowledgeable company of Yelp's Ramen Club, many of whom have posted reviews here too (Yee Gan, Yinnie, Josy..). So you may wish to peruse their reviews for more considered views on the quality of the ramen to be enjoyed here. With that in mind:I liked the ramen here. By that, I mean it was better than the ramen I had at Nagomi at Ramen 2.0. I also liked the option to re-stock with noodles for a mere \u00a31.50, something I took full advantage of. As someone long frustrated with the small portions served as standard of pasta and its various cousins, I greatly appreciated this option to double the carb element without doubling the price. That meant I left Ittenbari sated, rather than (as with Nagomi), straight for another eatery.It wasn't without its faults though. Chief amongst these was an unheard of minimum spend limit for paying on card - \u00a320! I repeat: twenty quid! Wtf? I thought \u00a310 was the worst it got. Apparently not. On top of that, the service was slightly scatty - not too bad, but could have been better.Still, I enjoyed my experience and would certainly return. Once I'd stopped by a cash machine.",

    "text": "RAMEN 3.0! Woohoo! It was a perfect day for Ramen - cold, rainy, and generally all around miserable. So a steaming pot of noodles and pork with some awesome Yelpers was just what the doctor ordered (and probably would have given I was soaked and chilled from our wonderful freak London rainstorms).Josy had graciously organised for us to try Ittenbari as a counterpoint to the tonkotsu ramen we've opted for the previous two times. This place offers a Shoyu ramen which is a soy sauce based ramen (tonkotsu is a pork broth base for those not in the know). I admit, that does sound a bit odd, but it's not like drinking soy sauce. Rather, think a rich hearty broth that's a mix between beef and miso soup. We got luckily and managed to get a table for 7 as we walked in. Given that there seemed to be a line of 10 people both immediately before and after we got there, I think someone up there must have liked us. There is a pretty high turnover (this is more a get in, eat, get out type of place mostly) so the wait isn't that long as long as your group is fairly small. The line appears to be a wait there until seated without an option to put your name down and come back. I can understand why given the high turnover but it does mean you will have to wait until after your meal to browse the cute little grocery store next door where English is a rarity. I wandered through and had to go back later with Josy as a guide to work out what the popular items were. I do know their red bean paste mochi was delicious.Alright, let's get cracking on the food and drink. Our sub-group ordered gyoza, kara-age, edamame, and of course the Shoyu Ramen. I also opted for the umeshu (plum wine) since Josy raved about the servings. As a note, my ice came with a black spongy thing in it and when they noticed it they quickly replaced my glass with fresh ice (and I hope fresh umeshu too!).Our food came in short order (and a lot faster than the other sub-group's...must have been my dazzling smile) with the gyoza, edamame, and kara-age piling on one after another. The gyoza were perfectly steamed to just shy of painfully hot and pan fried to a golden brown crisp. As noted by other reviewers, the gyoza comes in batches of 6 stuck together. Now I don't think this is because they couldn't be bothered to thaw them properly (and since I saw them making a batch by hand I doubt they are ever frozen), but rather for efficiency they've batched them by serving size. A bit annoying given the extra effort but the taste more than makes up for it.The edamame comes in fantastically large portions (none of this tiny miso bowl holding a bare handful of beans) and is generously covered in rock salt. We ate our fill and then some and still there were a few beans to be had. The kara-age deserves special mention as it hit that perfect balance of crispy breading and tender succulent meat. I think they marinate the chicken in some soy/ginger concoction before deep frying (excellent idea!) which gives it a deeper fuller flavour.Finally, the Shoyu Ramen. It's beautiful. Don't believe me? See the pictures above and tell me you don't want to shove that down your gullet as fast as possible and like Oliver T ask for just a bit more. As I mentioned above, it's a rich lip-smacking broth (there is a word for this but it escapes me this early in the morning) based on soy-sauce. This helps it avoid the slightly oily after taste you sometimes get with its meatier cousins (I'm looking at you, Tonkotsu). You can get the regular or deluxe version (go deluxe...for just under 2 squids more you get extra meat, egg, and noodles) both of which include large slices of pork with succulent fat, crunchy green veggies, and a generous serving of noodles. These are the thin noodles which have been pan friend briefly to give it a slightly chewier texture than you would expect. I'm a fan of this technique and will be copying it the next time I attempt homemade ramen. Think of it this way. We were getting full on the starters but once the ramen arrived all was forgotton. We luxuriated in the tender mouthfuls of noodle and melt in the mouth pork. We happily crunched our way through the verdant spring onions, low moans of food-induced happiness emanating whenever our mouths were full of rameny goodness. And we slurped (it's only proper manner to do so) savoury soy stock which filled our bellies with fire and fuzziness.All this washed down with generous gulps of sweet plum wine while chatting to some great people. How can life get any better?Go to Ittenbari. You'll be happy you did. I'm already thinking of when to go back...To be fair, a couple of minor annoying points. The other tables gyoza never showed despite repeated requests. The black mark in the ice should have been spotting before serving. But that's really about it.",

My litmus test for ethnic food places is always look to see if the actual nationality is sitting and eating there, to which end Ittenbari is filled with Japanese & ramen-loving locals (if you've been reading my reviews, you'll be aware I've had a few Mexi-can't experiences around town).The menu is pretty simple, but hey, they do it well. The broths are a little different to Tonkotsu, so it seemed more chicken/seafood based. Definitely worth a stop in if you're craving some noodles. They're claiming they're the best katsu curry in London as well, so I'll have to make a stop back in! *twists arm*Top tip, take cash with you, some people said there was a min, but when we went it was just cash-only.",

Perfect timing because we bagged with a massive table! (This is seriously an eat and go restaurant because if you stay longer, the queue will start giving you evils...) First impressions, 'I KNOW THIS JOINT, before it was ittenbari!' The ramen then wasn't so good at all. However, Ittenbari doesn't suffer the same consequences as RYO noodles did. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and it was SO tasty, a little on the salty side for me, but the broth is definitely the better ones I've had. We also ordered Gyoza and karaage, the weirdest gyozas ever, IT WAS INVISIBLE! I kid, they forgot our gyozas (insert sad face!) The Karaage was good, CRISPY CRISPY CHICKEN! (Even better than KFC-Sorry Colonel Sanders, you KNOW it's true-can anyone explain why KFC is NEVER crispy?!) I ordered the regular sized ramen bowl and was stuffed, but I think Peter.S supersized him with DX side and extra noodles. (Seriously, is Ittenbari trying to knock down the fast food giants?!

I am so chuffed to have found this new ramen-land!!I read Vicky's review, so although I was excited for Osaka-style ramen...I was also a little apprehensive that it wouldn't make me happy.

This means I was pre-disposed to love the world, especially when it involves ramen.As Vicky mentioned Ittenbari doesn't do tonkotsu ramen BUT they do serve yummy shoyu ramen. This is the ramen of choice after you have had a couple of drinks (I used to munch this kind of ramen at 4am/5am while waiting for the trains to start, to take me home to bed after clubbing in Osaka.) The base flavour is soy sauce, and it is filled with savoury goodness - Yum!The good:- The flavour tasted just as I hoped it would. I love this kind of soup- The egg was perfect and slightly gooey- The atmosphere! This is not a posh-nosh kind of place, but it feels right to have ramen in a canteen-style room.- I really like the Gyoza! They had the vinegar/chilli oil dip that I love, and they were all fried and stuck together (like they do in izakayas) Nom nom nom.- There was no minimum spend (I still don't really understand why the other ramen places have this!!)- They serve umeshu in large wine glasses. This was nice as most places in London are far too stingy when serving plum wine.- There was no queue (this is probably because we arrived at around 9pm)The bad:- I didn't get any nori in my soup! - It was quite a lot of effort to flag down members of staff to orderI chatted to the chefs on the way out , and they said the head chef-bloke was from Osaka. That must be why this ramen tastes like authentic Kansai yummy-ness.",

Great staff.I ordered the Seafood and fried ramen noodles, which came with prawns,fried noodles, snowpeas,kamobokubamboo shoots, japanese cabbage and squid. It's a hearty meal and worth the \u00a310.50. I only wish they offered vegetarian broth. I asked the waiter to leave the pork off which he did.The noodles start out crispy but get nice and al dente from the warmth of the seafood & veg topping.There were lots of Japanese people eating there, which is always a good sign. And I did hear one Japanese fellow say in Japanese to his companion that his soup was good.The noodles are Osaka style cuisine.Next time I'll try the veggie gyoza as well. Recommended!",

    "text": "So I walked past this place before with Wendy L and she was amazed I hadn't tried this place yet, I asked if it was new? A shocking \"No!\" followed, it has been here many years.So, on the last bank holiday Monday of May, we originally wanted to go to Ten Ten Tai but this place and Kulu Kulu were both shut, and I remembered this one! Yes! It's open! But it only takes cash, is that ok? Yes! Food please!Having looked at the menu it was a toss up between Ittenbari Ramen and the Miso Ramen. I picked Ittenbari and the other 3 people picked Miso Ramen. Curious, because the miso ramen contained marmite! Marmite? In ramen????Anyhow, I REALLY LOVED the stock in the Ittenbari ramen. It didn't have an overpowering taste of MSG so I wasn't gagging for water, but really wanted to drink the whole thing, except I was full from a snack earlier in the afternoon! The noodles were nice, felt like it could have had more meat in the bowl, and the half egg is nowhere as nice as the one from Bone Daddies. I tried a bit of the stock in the Miso ramen but couldn't really taste the marmite. Hmmm. My friends also tried the salmon salad, which had some good chewy seaweedy vegetables inside, they were quite nice with the salad sauce.We did order the sushi but I didn't try them, was too full! The sushi looked like a good size, but they were quite dear also.A comment is that the ventilation isn't that good in the restaurant. Further in there was a fan, but where we were, there was nothing. We were getting a bit overheated in there, even though it was rainy freezing outside!Ah well, another place to go for ramen, yay!",

    "text": "After the record breaking temperatures in the UK last week, you would have thought that I would have the disposition of Eeyore as torrential rain opened up on me as I set off for the Ramen 3.0 UYE. However, as the indomitable organiser of these London Ramen events, Josy A said, the cold and rain merely made it perfect 'ramen weather'!I met with Josy and Yinnie C at Ben & Jerry's in Leicester Square where they had just picked up their free Ben & Jerrys ice cream cone. Yes, you read right. Ben & Jerrys give free ice cream away once a year!Being the conscientious organiser that she is, Josy had already tried out Ittenbari and was able to direct us to the white sign at the Regent Street end of Brewer Street. Having been assured by the restaurant staff that she could book a table upstairs, multiple phone call attempts hadn't been picked up. However, fortuitously, virtually our whole party arrived together and we were seated immediately.The menu is quite short and our target, the ramen, currently comes in 2 flavours - shio, which has a seafood based soup and shoyu, which has a soy based soup. Unlike tonkatsu ramen, which is served at my current favourite ramen restaurant Cocoro, the soups here aren't boiled for hours with pork bones and so remain light and clear. The noodle bowls come in 2 sizes and the portions are generous and if you're really feeling piggy, you can opt for kaedama, where they add an extra ball of noodles to your remaining soup at the endI opted for a big helping shio ramen this time and was pleased when a large bowl (nothing like getting drenched in the spring rain in London to get the appetite going!) of noodles arrived. The pork chashu was cut in 3 generous slices and the boiled egg arrived with perfect just-set glistening yolk. The soup of course couldn't have the depth of flavour one gets with the hours of boiling involved in making tonkatsu ramen but it was tasty.I have to agree with Vicky L's suspicion about MSG though as I was quite thirsty for a few hours afterwards.Our kara age was nice - moist chicken breast meat in a crunchy coating given a nice tart boost by a squeeze of lemon. Sadly, we didn't get to pass judgement on the gyoza as it never arrived despite 2 reminders from Josy in perfect Japanese! Generally, the service was friendly but a bit Fawlty Towers. After eating there, I can understand why the booking telephone line was never picked upCompared to my favourite tonkatsu ramen at Cocoro, the chashu is better - larger slices and more succulent and the egg is perfection. However, the soup doesn't have the same depth as the tonkatsu soup. There's a place for both types of ramen in my heart and stomach and Ittenbari does have the added advantage of cheaper ramen and no \u00a320 minimum charge that you have at Cocoro.Thanks, Josy for organising a great UYE. Ra ra ramen!",

    "text": "This may one of the better ramen places in London, but when I've been to places in the states that are way better, it's hard for me to give Ittenbari more than an A-OK rating. It was a rainy night and some ramen sounded amazing so I yelped where to go on a Sunday night since nothing is open on Sundays in this city. Weird... Ittenbari is a cute little restaurant that is pretty typical of the ramen joints I've been to in the past. I decided on getting a regular Shoyu Ramen and some fried gyoza. The fried gyoza made its way out first and while they were good, I'm sure they were the frozen pre-made kind you can make yourself at home. The ramen comes in two sizes (regular and deluxe) and they have about 4 or 5 options you can choose from. The broth was tasty, but I felt like it was missing something. I couldn't put my finger on it, but overall it wasn't bad. If you're in the mood for something hot with noodles, it does the trick. I'd be willing to give it another shot when the next cold, rainy day comes around... or if I need a hangover fix!",

The ramen was...so so. The broth was quite unremarkable and didn't respond well to the eventual addition of chilli oil or soy sauce. I needed something to jazz it it! The slices of pork were bland even though they were very thick. The eye was overlooked and not runny enough in the middle. What saved the meal slightly was when I ordered another batch of noodles they came in what I believe was the miso broth and that was pretty solid. A flavoursome broth, bouncy noodles and responded well to the bits and piece from the other bowl. In the end, ittenbari ramen abandoned",

    "text": "I have been looking for a decent Ramen restaurant in London since forever, and I think I've found my spot (although I am yet to try Tonkotsu on Dean Street).I was greater in a friendly manner as I walked through the door and seated. I was given enough time to sit down and analyse every item on the menu. I decided to go for the Shio Ramen as I'm quite the fan of clear broths and really wanted to see if it was as salty as most people say. When the bowl of Ramen arrived (which was less than five minutes), the first thing I did was dip the spoon to the bottom of the bowl, bringing it back up to the surface with a spoonful of broth and aimed for my mouth.......Umai!... I immediately tasted the chicken and vegetable flavours with an ever so slight seafood hint! I also got a little Miso kick too (not sure if it was actually in there), you see I'm not a fan of strong Miso flavour it's a little too rich for my little tastebuds. The noodles has just the right amount of bite to them, feeling dense when bitten into but oh so light and springy when slurping (yep I slurp noodles)! The veggies included spinach which was lovely, negi and bamboo shoots (although I was hoping to get some of the thick cuts of menma seen in Ramen made in Japan). I found the bamboo a little coarse but still enjoyed it in the bowl none the less.The chashu was a little on the dry side (no juices oozing from it like some of the ramen pics seen in Japanese magazines) but it did the job, there just wasn't enough of it...! The soft boiled egg was the icing on the cake for me! The creamy texture of the yolk worked perfectly with the broth and noodles combined, I wish I had more of it!... Which leads me to my final point, the portion. While I am no beast I found the portion of chashu and egg on the small side, I could have done with at least four slices of pork and another half of an egg (or two maybe). One slice of chashu is not enough to share around with the rest of the ingredients in the bowl, I basically finished the pork and egg and had noodles, broth and spinach left.I think I'll definitely try the deluxe bowl next time and see how I feel after that!All in all (sorry for the extended review) I throughly enjoyed my bowl of ramen and will definitely come back here probably becoming a regular diner (sorry purse).......",

Judging by some of the other reviews, I may be the only person who got sushi at a known ramen joint, but the sushi was actually very good (albeit on the pricey end). I had tuna sushi which was 6 pieces of nigiri style sushi. The sushi was very fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.
