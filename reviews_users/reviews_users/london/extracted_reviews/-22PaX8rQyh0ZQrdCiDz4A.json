    "text": "I like to visit coffee@bermondsey in the morning for a quick coffee and delicious yogurt/granola breakfast creation they stock - it's not made in-house but everything in it is fresh and organic, produced by Laura's Idea. I can highly recommend it - it comes in a vegan version too for those of you out there who are into that. I have eaten lunch here a number of times, not because the food is great, but because it is directly across the road from where I work and I often don't have long for a lunch break. Their lunch-time food consists of pre-packaged sandwiches which they'll toast for you. They're okay, but I find a number of their sandwiches are a bit samey. They also sell soups and salads (I don't think either are made in house) and these are also okay, but everything is just a tad too expensive. Having said that, their custard tarts are worth every penny! As Rob has said in a previous review, they are trying a bit too hard to be quirky (the lampshades are made out of cardboard coffee tops) and lately I've been taking my lunch back to the office because it gets really crowded and they often play the music too loud.",

    "text": "This may not be the most amazing coffee house in all of London, but it is definitely the best in the London Bridge area. Yes the decor is 'different', with paper-cup lampshades and breezeblock walls, but it's still a great place to chill out, especially for those who work in the area and want a break from the office. There is a good selection of organic salads and sandwiches on offer, albeit pre-packed, and the coffees and teas are the real thing. The idea of this place is to not take things too seriously, it's just a fun cafe where you can grab a cup of coffee or a quick lunch. An added touch is the jar of doggie biscuits at the back for whoever happens to have brought their canine friend along.",

Yes it's not dirt cheap and the food options are a little eclectic, but it's a great chilled out, arty atmosphere and even on a busy weekday lunch it's not overly crowded (just more difficult to find a place to sit). With free wifi, magazines, papers and funky music playing (but not too loudly) it's a great place for a quick lunch or a long, lingering coffee afternoon. The hot sandwiches come presented in a little cardboard lunchbox with a handful of crisps \u00a0brilliant concept. They also sell a range of fruit and healthy snack bars at the counter. Ohand the counter always has the day's horoscopes cut out and on display. A brilliant way to while away a few seconds whilst waiting for your order. Ohand I'm not sure if they do this any more, but as recently as a year ago, they gave out glittery headbands with springy ear-things as your 'number' when waiting for an order. So weird..but in a good way.",

    "text": "I tend to think of coffee shops as having two important elements: 1) the coffee, preferably in espresso form, and 2) the lounging factor (ie comfort & availability of couches, type of atmosphere, quality of WiFi). This is one of five Coffee@ cafes around town and is usually quite busy, especially on weekends.First, the joe. Bermondsey Street Coffee (BSC) produces a decent espresso (I reckon they probably use Union beans as opposed to my preferred Monmouth) which I'm happy to sit casually sipping although the chai tea latte was a bit bland. In all fairness, I do like strong flavours that pack a punch whereas the chai tea was more like my little cousin's attempts to try to tickle me - you know what it's trying to do but it's just not working.Lounging-wise, this place is pretty comfortable with a ton of couches and easy chairs that are deeply padded and mostly clean. It invites you to sink in and fall into a semi-comatose daze which is perfect after wandering through Borough Market for a couple of hours and then trying to make it home. There are also more study tables and chairs for those who want to get some work done as well as a whole row of power sockets in the front half so you can plug in your computer and not worry about battery life. Music is quite chilled house-type and varies depending on which barista plugged in their iPod I think. Overall, fits well with the general atmosphere. I've got to give props for the creative use of legos and only wish they laid some out alongside the board games for me to entertain my inner child.There is free wifi (well for an hour at least) and you can get the password from the baristas which essentially means you either need to be shameless or order something. Prices aren't too bad so don't worry about it, beats the hell out of Starbucks for sure. Unfortunately, the wifi is pretty slow and not good for more than basic emails with facebook and even some google searches taking a bit of time to load. Don't bother trying to stream music or video, it's hopeless. For reference, when I was trying to connect it was about 11am and there were maybe a handful of people in the shop. I can't imagine what it's like when the place is rammed.BSC also has a selection of sandwiches and I think even hot paninis (all organic and healthyish of course) plus the usual array of muffins, cookies, and pastries. I haven't yet sampled the food so no comments there.Overall, a good place to grab a coffee or sit and relax for a while. It's on the way to work for me so that helps too and given the rarity of places to relax away from tourists in London Bridge it's a winner for that alone.",

Before I have time to stop myself, it's 1990-something, I'm wearing flannel, rocking braces, VHS taping every episode of My So Called Life, listening to grunge music on my walkman and debating whether I should buy some JNCOs, or if they look 'way too skater' on me. \u00a0 The funky mismatched atmosphere and the trendily uncouth vibe as well as the above average coffee perpetuate this Seattle upbringing flashback, and for the record, there is nothing wrong with this. In fact, I oft enjoy a trip back in time - especially when it involves said above average coffee, some organic juices and softs and some locally made munchies. The present day BSC experience also involves a connection to the world wide web that doesn't make robot sex sounds, although I would trade that futuristic perk for Jordan Catalano any day.",

The walls are nicely decorated with neon signs, while the lampshades are made up of paper espresso cups. They have free wi-fi.

I could go on.As Hannah R. mentioned previously, I was drawn to it originally because of the chalkboard outside, which read \"Americans now welcome\" after Obama was elected. It's that type of place.When you order food (a sandwich, a cup of soup), instead of receiving a number or a token, you get a nice sparkling headband with glittery gold springs. Of course, you don't HAVE to wear them, but what's the fun in holding something like that in your hand?Mostly vegan/vegetarian food is served here, but I can vouch for it's tastiness (and this is coming from an avid meat eater).Also, during the holiday season, they hung their christmas tree upside down from the ceiling, with a Buzz Lightyear doll grabbing onto the top (bottom).",

This is laptop central in here! Generally great vibe, chalkboards covered in witticisms. Though generally great, the staff are sometimes a bit casual. Would give four and a half stars but not five - as there's always room for improvement.",

    "text": "The best thing about this place was reading the determination of the trademark commission when the owners of this place attempted to register it. To say that it was amusing was an understatement, and they have it on pride of place for everybody to see it if they want a bit of a laugh. Anyway, it seems as if they manage to actually get the name approved since it is the name that I find plastered on most parts of the internet (though some sites seem to want to censor at least a part of the name). Anyway, it seems as if the owners of this place try to go out of their way to cause offense, but honesty I basically came here because of the name, and to also see what their coffee was like. Well, considering the line that eventually went out of the door, it is pretty clear as to how popular this place is (though not as popular as another place I visited on this side of the Thames). In fact the place was almost close to being packed. As for the coffee, well I have to admit that it wasn't bad at all, which suggests that people end up here for reasons other than the name.",

Their almond croissants are worth every last calorie and there are other pastries here too that look pretty good (but I'm boring when it comes to this stuff). For non breakfast needs, they have all sorts of soups, salads and sandwiches and things to keep vegans happy. Highly recommended is the Thai chicken soup. And all of the salads, although they are small. So basically you can get a pastry and a soup and they cancel each other out. Right? All of the items that you get here come in take away form. There is hour long wifi and lots of seats. Be prepared to share your couch/table. If you can, grab a window seat or a spot outside: people watching bonanza.Always good music here.",

    "text": "There are good coffee shops in London. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. The coffee is pretty good, but it's not \"\u00a34 for a 'medium' as tall as my pinky finger\" good. I also can't quite figure out how it takes such a long time to make the drinks. There are consistently 4+ people behind the counter. One person asks for your order, the next person enters it into the till, then a third person writes it on the cup, and a fourth person grinds the beans, and then....you get the point. The service is shit. Not only is it slow, but it comes with a serious attitude from the individuals making the drinks. They give off the \"I can't believe you're bothering me\" vibe. Maybe they are trying to be \"cool\"? I'm not into it. They seem to care very little about the line of customers trying desperately to caffeinate themselves, and very much about carrying on conversations with each other. I once waited 11 minutes for an Americano. Now, let's talk about the atmosphere. While at first glance it looks pretty cozy, I often find it difficult to score a seat. The place is crawling with people who use it as a remote office...all day. Because it's a long and narrow space, you often find yourself in a corner in the rear and it's a pretty dreary place to be 9 months out of the year. Not welcoming, poor service, and the coffee, while several steps up from Starbucks, isn't worth the trouble. Head to Hej Coffee in Bermondsey Square instead. You'll find clever and lovely staff, amazing coffee, and a bright and welcoming interior.",

Especially when you go to places with only big groups of people who seem to stare at you because you're alone (that's probably just you being paranoid, but still). It's in those moments that you need a place like this one, where it doesn't matter if you're alone or with friends, where people are just sitting back in comfy chairs reading the newspaper or typing on their computer and groups of friends are calmly enjoying their coffee (which doesn't mean the atmosphere is boring, it's quite the opposite!). I bumped into this place after a long and tiring walk so it was the perfect spot to take a break and read a book. I'd say this is a good place to study or write a paper but the music is loud so unless loud music is your key to concentration, it's not ideal for that. The banana smoothy is delicious and the decoration is messy in a cozy way.Place to be for all you lonely Londoners (or for people with loads of friends too of course)!",

Two things that are somewhat irritating: 1) the tables by the door are welded into the floor, but they're really far out from the benches... so you have to perch at the very edge of your seat or otherwise, just be very tall and willing to hunch over your laptop. 2) there's free wifi, but you need to ask them for a logon code every hour because it kicks you off after 60 minutes.

    "text": "A trendy and hipster coffee shop tucked away on Bermondsey Street and also a great place to do work. I'm staying in the area for two weeks and have come here a few times to get work done. There's wifi, lots of outlets, and a great selection of coffee and soups for lunch. I didn't get to try any of the soups but they all sound and smell amazing. The cappuccino here is pretty good. My only complaint is that it's not hot enough for me, but the vibes of this place make up for it. The place gets pretty busy around lunch time but I've always managed to find a seat. The baristas are all very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. Overall, Fuckoffee is a pretty good place to hang out, have lunch and enjoy the electric music or plug in and study with some good coffee.",

Having tried most of the options, I have landed on Fuckoffee, they arent just a numerous name which they play on to great effect they also have an exceptional product. They have a huge range of baked goodies for your nibbling pleasures as well as small selection of breakfast and lunch options. Go for the name...stay for the coffee!",

It's exquisitely hipster with concrete floors, quirky details (like the Lego made pots and dog or 'bitch' biscuits), and feels like a bit of an artist's collage.Great detailing, right down to the (working) Bit Coin machine out back.I think they're trying to go with for coffee with bad-ass attitude and it works.Coffee is reasonable, not a bad price and not a bad taste.They also do a nice chocolate brownie - extremely gooey and finger sticking good.Nice place to hang out if you want a hot beverage, staff are friendly despite the impression you might get from the name.It's always quite busy, full of those laptop welding sorts, although interestingly not a sea of Mac to be seen!",

    "text": "I'm probably going to be judged for only awarding the place 3 stars but please hear me out!Fuckoffee is a seriously Hipster vibe of a coffee haunt on Bermondsey street, with sister coffee joints over London - and the Hipster scene is something they do extraordinarily well! Kitsch decor, puns all over the menu and walls, obscenities to tickle your fancy ('Cockalate' on your cappucino anyone?). They offer a good selection of cakes and patisseries - catering for all you dietary needy GF and Vegan Foodies (God, love ya). In terms of barista skills I'm going to have to go with another A-OK review. I've been here more than a few times, as it does always impress friends but after visiting again this weekend I have decided that enough is enough with the luke-warm bland soya lattes and slightly burnt flat whites.Don't get me wrong, the staff are the nicest, it's a good place to hang out, and if you're a Mac Book owner you probably don't want to be seen dead in any of the other coffee joints along Bermondsey Street. But coffee is what I go here for, coffee is what I pay for and if I'm not particularly enjoying it I just have to reel in my hipster wannabe mentality (time to leave that phase behind gracefully) and say no more.Definitely worth visiting to obtain one of their customer loyalty cards - seriously neat - But if you need me, I'll be in Hej. Thoroughly enjoying my coffee.",

Essentially though it's nothing out of the ordinary cafe wise, with the hot chocolate getting a bad rating from my friend. Her words were its meh.. Too bitter, not enough of it and mostly all cream. Not a glowing rating then.I guess I went with super high expectations, otherwise this could have easily been a 4 star, judging only on coffee.",
