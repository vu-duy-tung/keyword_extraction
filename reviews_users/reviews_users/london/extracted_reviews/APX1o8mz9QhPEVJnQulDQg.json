Around lunchtime the tables start to fill up, but never fully. They do some basic lunch items for 3 quid and more interesting (but giant portions) items for around 7 quid. It's a very mellow place during the day, definitely worth stopping by if you need to rest your feet.",

Though, this is a members' bar, the queue outside is people without memberships waiting to try their luck. Flip a coin and see which queue you want to try.",

The decor is fantastic - brilliant dramatic wallpaper and weird little tables, plus the aforementioned flashing dancefloor. It's surprisingly small down there but pretty vibey once the dancing starts to happen, and all the staff seemed pretty friendly. There's a bigger bar upstairs but I only walked through it.",

During the day this place is full of people tapping at their laptops, having casual work meetings and doing lunch. It is a very open atmosphere. Entering through a revolving door the bar is situated in the middle of the venue. The most amazing sash windows which slide open in the summer letting the cool breeze and the sound of the street in.In the evening this place turns into a regular Shoreditch hotspot. Often people are queuing outside or it is just simply full to capacity! Downstairs is a huge venue room with awesome floor lights. Often hosting interesting gigs, private parties or just dancing! Very relaxed atmosphere, the bar staff are very chilled so don't expect overly speedy service!",

    "text": "So here's the thing; in the wake of MJ's untimely death, I think it's important to find as many locations for a bit of impromptu boogying as possible. Places where you can cut up that rug in homage to the moonwalking marauder himself. And as Saturday Night Fever, that splendid John Travolta vehicle of the 70s, taught us, the best places to throw some shapes have multi-coloured light up floors. Following this admittedly over-reaching set of definites, I can only conclude that in order to pay tribute to Messr. Wacko, you need to go to the Electricity Showroom and gawp at their bling floor and the myriad gyrating bodies which adorn it. Now were it not for my desire to throw dedications to a musical legend around, I'd be a bit less keen on ES; on the weekends it's crammed full of suited and booted office workers, making it impossible to get a drink without a long wait and an earful of city chat, and the prices are pretty steep. But that floor. Oh that floor. It saves this place from mediocrity and lifts it to hallowed haven of disco. Well, maybe not, but it's pretty cool.",

I like the light-up dance floor and I like that the doorman always let me skip the queue.

The music is quite good, but I didn't feel like all of it was fit for dancing to. The drinks were reasonably priced, which is a plus :] Another thing I didn't like was that there was no coat check (at least not one I could find) so I had to put my things by some seating near us, which made me nervous the whole time. Overall I'd come back sometime, but I'd make sure not to bring anything I wouldn't want to leave alone.",

Could we not be accompanied by a light show from a giant plastic cockerel, its 'feathers' flashing every 3 seconds? Was this too much to ask? Not for the 'Showroom anyway. I would recommend this bar for a sight of this bird alone as it is truly is one of the ugliest wall hangings I've ever seen but weirdly appropriate in this venue. Whenever I'm near the bird I find myself completely transfixed in a game of trying to count all the dud bulbs before the next flash. Sounds fun huh? Now I know a little better, I avoid the bird and head straight downstairs to the club area which is just as bright but not quite so hypnotising. There is a fun mix of music between cheesy 'classics' and contemporary beats and a great Saturday night fever dance floor. Visit here when your sober and it's quite fun to count how many people strike the John Travolta pose to their friends as though it's a piece of comedy genius. Have a drink too many though and you won't be able to restrain yourself from lifting that pointed index finger to the ceiling. I like the Electricity Showrooms because although they're situated in trends-ville Hoxton they still seem to have a bit of their own personality and playfulness. Definitely a good place to start for a fun night out.",

It was a little bit awesome, i have to say. Coincidence? Who knows. Maybe he was a birthday fairy with special powers that the showroom keeps under the light-up floor.

By the time it closes, most of the other nearby bars are packed so make sure you either leave early to beat the rushes at other places or plan on making it an early (~1am) night. Can get crowded, but hey, what good bar doesn't? Not much to offer in terms of drinks--pretty standard fare--but it has good ambiance. Side note: this place is a hipster magnet, so enter at your own risk. There's a club in the basement but I've never been into it, so I'm not sure if it's any good. Recommendation: make it your first stop of the evening. That way it won't be too crowded and you'll be ready to move on early enough to beat the rush for other bars/clubs in the area.",

Beckoned downstairs by a flashing cockerel and promising sounds of groovetastic soul favourites, I was rewarded with the long-to-be-believed-extinct light up dancefloor that even the shyest of folk couldn't resist. And the Michael Jackson montage was definitely an incentive. It was pretty steamy in all aspects of the matter, from the temperature to the DJ's attitude, and even the queue to reach the bar was pretty hot and heavy. This is my sole star-retracting beef. Don't hate, ventilate! But swinging by for a Saturday night booze+boogie sesh is totally worth it, if solely for the possibility of seeing R.O.U.Ss and Unicorns co-mingling with Inigo Montoya. If anywhere, it could happen at Electricity Showroom.",

It's certainly the only pub I've ever seen with a revolving door to get in. I wonder if that has caused some amusement when particularly drunk people have been leaving at the end of a night. Has a couple of ales on tap and an extensive choice of beers beyond that. Should be something for everybody. On a 2nd visit I wandered downstairs where it's legendary disco floor can be found and enjoyed a portion of possibly the best Karaoke night I have ever come across. In general I'm a Karaoke hater but the song list was extensive and unpredictable and people danced to the songs too! I have been more than once since and this place just continues to grow on me. I gave it a 3 initially but now it scores a 4. Could well be worth a 5 at some point, particularly if it's ales are off less often (off in the not available sense rather than the bad tasting sense).",

A plus is also the huge neon sign outside makes it easy to spot.We only had drinks, but the food that came out looked really good. I had pleanty of opportunity to see it, as the barman also acted as waiter. His waiting seemed seemed to be his priority, as I had to wait patiently at the bar, as he kept disappearing to get more meals from the kitchen. At least I knew I would be the next person to be served, as I was the only person waiting at the bar.The drught beer selection seemd to be sewn up by the Camden Brewery, although they had one draugh lager alternative in Estrella Damm, which was my choice.On going to the toilets downstairs, I saw a huge function room, which I understand is a populr disco.Despite appearing invisible for several minutes, I would come back here. It had a nice laid-back atmosphere. Although I'm talking about a Sunday afternoon. I'm sure it's a totally different stoty on a Friday por Saturday evening.",

I like it, its a nice down to earth clientelle, made up mostly of locals.Having met a friend and wandered around Shoreditch, as usual, my stomach was grumbling. There are \u00a0the usual suspects in the area for a roast like The Princess of Shoreditch, The Old Red Cow, Jones & Sons and a few if you were to look at the numerous guides on the web. I know of one undiscovered talent, which I will introduce you to next time as I completely forgot to take pics. But here, today, we have Electricity Showrooms. We wanted somewhere not too busy, so we went off Shoreditch High Street and decided upon this venue as it only had five tables full. I had no idea there would be a roast, I just figured I was glad to be away from the usual Sunday masses around Shoreditch/Brick Lane etc. Upon seeing the roast on the menu, it was a no-brainer. \u00a0I ordered half a roast chicken with the trimmings. It came with a creamy broccoli, on the side and a decent amount of gravy, on the side. The chicken was partnered with lush roast potatoes, parsnips, carrots and of course the obligatory massive Yorkshire pudding. I hate having to ask for extra gravy, as most places are normally stingy, but this was excellent. Smothering this delicately roasted chicken was a delight. My companion opted for spicy chicken wings and fries - she enjoyed hers, but I could see there was a bit of food envy.Electricity Showrooms was a nice little surprise and certainly deserves its spot on a list if the requirement is good food, chilled Sunday vibe and reasonable pricing.",

Hmmm... On our arrival, we saw 2 tables in the front with 'reserved' signs so how come this one at the back was missed? Hmmm...We vacated & went to the bar to continue our drinks but kept sight of the table to see who these folks were. To our suprise they were the Invisible People of Imaginery Land.

Which as you would imagine, I rather liked!",

Sadly, it wasn't as lively as I assume Fridays or Saturdays are (though it had more people than many of the bars in the immediate vicinity). They were showing a World Cup game, and we sat at the bar upstairs and struck up good conversations with the two bartenders. They were super friendly. The space itself is pretty big, with a bunch of tables for dining against the windows, and booths in the back with more privacy.",

    "text": "This is one of my first thoughts when going out for drinks, or going somewhere to eat. The selection of drinks is great, especially as it seems to be one of the rare places around that actually sells porters and stouts!Furthermore, the food is wonderful, my favourite being the sweet potato wedges. I usually find that this place is very lively, especially on an evening. This may mean that service takes a little longer than one might want, but I can easily put this worry aside as the experience of coming here is just so good. Last but not least, I adore the decor. If you take the time to look around, you will find many things that will make you giggle and wonder.Overall, it is one of my favourite places in the area and I would heavily advise going.",

Despite protest the bar staff fobbed him off for no good reason at all. Poor staff numbers doesn't equate to an excuse for incompetence. Not in a hurry to return.Other than the service, the atmosphere was pleasant enough.",
