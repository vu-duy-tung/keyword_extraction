Est. Indian has the best I have ever eaten in my life, and I have eaten a lot of gulab jamun. \u00a0Naturally, the food is as good and very well prepared. I am hesitant to give 5 stars only because I want to keep this place just to myself, but of course that just wouldn't be fair.",

I was saddened the didn't have my favourite indian dessert but the sweet balls and carrot dish were sweet and tasty, without feeling like we downed a plate of sugar. My non fish eating friend was surprised he was eating a piece of fish and happily, which is quite the coup. There is a tasty range of non standard beers, which our waiter was familiar across, as he was the most of the menu.",

I've tried many things on the menu...favorite starters are the grill platter, malai jhinga prawns, and the lamb chops. Vegetables are good, particularly the saag bhaji. But the dish I dream about is the chicken Kali mirch. It's a slightly sweet curry with lots of black pepper and cardamom. It's an amazing combination. I've even been known to share veggie Kali mirch with a vegetarian colleague, and I'm quite a carnivore. The curry would make shoe leather delicious. Go here, you won't be sorry.",

The railway curry is the clear example of this. This dish was very familiar to an Iranian dish of Khoresht (stew) with Aubergine. The rich tomato sauce with potatoes was very nice and with the lamb cooked in the sauce, it pulled apart so easily. I am a big fan of the Iranian dish and this one too, bringing back memories of my parents cooking.The dish that we all really liked was the special concoction developed by the manager. The mix between jalfrezzi and the bhutani was really good. The aromatic flavour came from frying the onions first and this with a creamy sauce and big bites of chicken were very pleasant. The richness and depth from the spices were a key reason to enjoying this dish. The extra heat from the Jalfrezzi side of things were what my dad especially liked and made sure this dish was well liked by all three of us.",

Side veggies are a good idea, although the serving amount in one curry will satisfy most moderate eaters. I didn't try the dessert but the wine list is moderately priced and well selected.

When we asked for a cocktail menu, seeing as they had a full bar, they were confused and said they would ask for one from the bartender, but never returned with an answer. The tandoori prawns (malai jhingha) was the worst dish. The prawns were mushy in the middle. When we told the waiter, he brought us another order, but it was the same. Clearly they don't use fresh seafood. We also ordered the paneer tikka masala and the tomato sauce was grossly sweet like marinara, not like Indian curry. The chatt was tasty, although the presentation was sloppy. The tandoori broccoli was surprisingly good. We would not return nor recommend the food or service.",

    "text": "I always like to go out for a curry when I'm in the UK because it's usually phenomenal, and Est. India was no exception. We met up with a friend living in London on his recommendation (always ask the locals). I had the kerala curry with lamb (\u00a39.45). It says chicken on the menu, but they were able to make the swap, no problem. The lamb was tender and the curry was so flavorful, with wonderful spices and just the right amount of heat (for me). My husband had a spicier dish, but I still found it delicious. Our friend had the jalfrezi, which he said was the best and hottest jalfrezi he's ever had. We also ordered basmati rice (\u00a32.50) and garlic and coriander (cilantro) naan (\u00a32.95) to go along with the curries. The rice was good, but not really necessary because the naan was filling and possibly the best garlic naan I've ever had. It was perfect. So, order more naan instead of rice!Service was good and non-intrusive; make sure you ask for the bill or you'll be sitting there awhile. We made reservations for a weekday at 6:30, but it looked like there were plenty of seats. The restaurant itself was classy, upscale, and nicely decorated. But that doesn't really matter...go for the food!",

Tasted home made rather than the greasy, creamy restaurant food. The chicken had a different spice compared to usual tandoori spices, but it hit the spot.Usually Rotis are small and become hard by the time you get them. These were hot and layered. Yum!!! The pilau rice was lightly spiced and went well with the two entrees.Big portions for main course. Well worth the 44.30\u00a3Now I regret doing the takeaway instead of dining in.Keep doing whatever you doing, guys!!!",

    "text": "tl;dr great Indian food in a cozy and modern space, no BYOB = peaceful ambienceI didn't know this, but it turns out most Indian places in the UK are BYOB. Sometimes though, you just want to enjoy good Indian food without the associated racket of noisy people really, really enjoying their alcohol. This place offers that respite.The general consensus is that the food met our high standards. The Samosa Chat was very flavorful and well spiced, probably our favorite part of the meal. The Bhindi dish was as good as other places I've had. The Lamb Curry (forget which one, it was creamy and very curry-like in consistency), was not what I expected - it was like a spicy version of Tiki Masala, which is fine, but I prefer more substance in my curry. Nevertheless it was very tasty, and the lamb chunks was cooked just right. Finally, the Peshwari Naan was delicious, I love a little sweet to go with my savory curries.The only caveat is that, especially as an American, we find the prices to be a little dear. We still think it is worth it though.",

The menu featured fewer vegetarian options than I like to see but I ended up getting something I don't normally order - sag aloo - and absolutely loving it. Seriously, it was to die for. Husband enjoyed his chicken tikka masala, I may have sneaked a little taste of the sauce and it was quite good. The garlic & coriander naan was good, but in my opinion could have stood to have more garlic. (That's my Californian palate talking - I'm used to a lot of seasoning.) Overall, really good meal, reasonable prices, generous servings. Definitely recommend.",

We knew getting Indian cuisine was a must before leaving and while we were hustling to find some grub before our bus to take us back to our hotel. We stumbled across this place. Going into the restaurant was a nicely dim-lit ambiance and it was clear many tables were already on reservations for the night but luckily we were able to be seated. Service was good! Waiters & Waitresses were respectful and attentive to us while still giving us all the time we needed to decide on our entrees. My boyfriend settled on Chicken Tiki Masala and I went with their Lamb Curry. We checked in on yelp which allowed us a free appetizer (Garlic Nan) which was great!We had a delightful meal and went back with happy stomachs! :)Highly recommend for a nice dinner out with friends or significant others!",
