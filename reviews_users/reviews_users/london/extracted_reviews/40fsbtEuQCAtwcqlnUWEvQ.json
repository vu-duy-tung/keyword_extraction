    "text": "I've been there almost four times; so I might as well give it 5 stars, but here's the problem.The food has gotten increasingly pedestrian and the food tastes nowhere like what I remember it as when I went there the first time. The place looks nice, some amount of thought definitely went in there; but I could only tell after I could magically look beyond the intense scent of incense that blinded my brain cells.While some of the menu is definitely creative, the meats don't feel like the freshest. This I have felt on more than one occasion. One possible issue with quality is the inconsistency between starters and the mains. The starters are almost unmissable. The mains are a big let down after the starters. Specifics: Try all the starters. The salmon/kaffir wontons get five stars for innovation. Among mains, the black bream is something of a saving grace, and the lotus root/artichoke Dauphinoise gets special mention for attempting a riot of flavours. Despite my three stars, I would recommend going there at least once.",

Every dish had it's own unique flavor and it was a very reasonable price. A great find near London bridge!",

Granted I'm a Bay Area transplant rental (here for 1 month for work) so in terms taste, pricing, and experience, it's hard to ignore what I know from the States and judge just based on my food experience in London.Anyway, it's a small place near the hospital. Not a fancy place. I ordered a two course meal for 27.95 (30.80 pounds after service charge): a salmon wrap for my appetizer and a duck curry. To be absolutely honest, I think I could get this meal for 15 pounds equivalent in the States. What I did think was neat was they served this complimentary lime juice mussel and fried frog leg dish in the beginning. That was probably the best \"dish\" for me. Don't get me wrong, the duck was good, I'm just not too sure at that price point.If I wanted to spend that kind of money, I think I would have expected more. Or, I should really just go back to eating some steak.It's tough over here to know what's overvalued and what's considered good. The lines are blurred far too often when you're just exploring places to eat.Edit: Lowering my rating for this from 3 to 2. I still can't justify the \u00a331 I spent on duck curry and salmon wrap appetizer.",

    "text": "Easily one of my favourite restaurants in London.This restaurant has been on this quiet back street behind Borough High Street for over 10 years. They must be doing something right. I find this place to be a total experience for the senses. The atmosphere is carefully controlled with incense burning, name cards on the table, and odd oriental objects scattered around.The waiter asks casually about any food allergies or dietary requirements so as to bring suitable amuse-bouches. I like this touch, and I've always been impressed with what is produced. As a pesce I don't want to be offered meat, but don't want to prevent my companions from enjoying it. The menu items are inventive and always beautify presented. It is a good place to take risks. Don't go for the \"safe\" option. You will get food envy when the other meals arrive. The menu is a set price, so the cost is predictable. It is not what I would call cheap, and wine will push the price up. But this is a special occasion restaurant and on that basis I think it is good value. The cocktails aren't bad either.",

So off I popped to check it out a couple of nights ago; it was booked out at the time i got there so secured a reservation for an hour later (so pre-booking is a definite). The ambience was fantastic so in the intervening hour spent in a nearby pub, we really were looking forward to supper. \u00a0The menu was really interesting. I would say that if you aren't adventurous, this isn't the place for you. The menu did not really have your standard Asian fare, and instead had fantastic things like ostrich for mains and carpaccio of pineapple with cracked pepper for desert (both of which I had). From the little tasting morsels at the start and through three fantastic courses, all of which was incredibly filling, it was a splendid evening. The wine menu was good, and there was a lovely little sauvignon blanc to accompany the meal.",

The service was very good, food was very well prepared but relatively pricey for Malaysian food. Having travelled to Malaysia before, I did not feel Champor-Champor's food was quite \"Malay\". To me, the food was rather a mixture of Thai, Malay and Chinese. My companions, one Chinese Malaysian and one American whose parent is a Chinese immigrant from Malaysia, agreed with me. I would have rated four stars if I didn't have such an expectation to have real Malaysian food, thus three stars. Highly recommend booking in advance. Very romantic and intimate atmosphere.",

On the past two occasions that I went there we were left waiting to order, waiting to receive menus, waiting to order drinks, waiting waiting waiting.

I complained later to the manager by email and he was very gracious in sorting it out, but it really spoilt what has been a fantastic restaurant in every sense. The food is still wonderful, with its malaysian fusion and unusual ingredients (not many places in London offer crocodile), and you can't fault the decor (all done by the chef himself).

Either way, the food is prepared with care and tastes pretty good. The prices, whilst not cheap, are fairly reasonable. We were presented with the high summer/autumn menu, which included bread and canapes (with the odd feature of banana bread with an olive oil and balsamic dip!), a starter and a main for \u00a325. Dessert added an extra \u00a34.50 to the bill, and the optional 'inter-course' palate-cleansers added an extra \u00a32.80. Include wine and the automatically-incurred 15% service charge, and dinner for two came to \u00a397. Like I said, not cheap, but I think it was reasonable for what we got. The decor and ambience is fantastic. It's a cosy little place, but not cramped. The dining room is full of eastern aromas, ornaments and drapes, which conspire with the subdued lighting to provide a relaxed and potentially romantic atmosphere. Service was friendly and attentive. I'm not sure it was worth a whopping 15% on the bill, but I really couldn't fault it. In summary \u00a0decent food, decent service and lovely ambience in a slightly obscure location.

    "text": "A rare find hidden a short walk from London Bridge Station. It's not a place that many have actually heard of as they don't over commercialise themselves. They don't need to, it's a place spread mainly through word of mouth, as those who have had the chance to go there all have an understanding about how good this place is.I've only been once, but that one time I have never forgotten, and I am bursting to go again. Champor Champor means 'mix and match' in Malay, which is reflected in each of \u00a0their imaginative Asian fusion dishes. It is an eclectic range of flavoursome ingredients which are blended together to form some delicious dishes. Each dish is an all encompassing meal of its own and there isn't an option to have side orders. \u00a0For instance, a dish in the main course is satay marinated ostrich fillet, with preserved pickled Chinese mustard leaf and vegetable tagine. When we went, in between courses the chef kindly brought us a bowl of soft shelled crab salad. It came out crisp on the outside and the meat was soft on the inside. We were also presented with a small bowl of savoury sorbet. Now that was a treat and was pleasantly soothing to the palette.Just sitting in this small restaurant is a treat for the eyes. It was designed by one of the owners and each wall has a different painting or ornament of some sort on them. Apparently, it even gets changed from time to time. But the paintings which adorn the walls, along with the general d\u00e9cor is beautiful and being in Champor Champor is like being in an enchanting little museum or like you're in some traditional Malay folk story. For both lunch and dinner each individual dish doesn't come with a separate price. Instead, you have the choice of having either two or three courses at a set price. During lunchtimes, you can enjoy two courses for \u00a319.90 and three for \u00a323.50. During dinner, in which you should definitely pre- book, it is \u00a325 for two courses and \u00a0\u00a329 for three. You can also do cooking classes on Saturdays (you have to book) for a minumum party of two and maximum of four. For \u00a349.50 per person, the chef will teach you how to make a few of their tantalizing dishes. It is one of those places which you gain an experience which tantalizes, in the best way, most of your sense. What you see around you is fairy tail like, the smell of the food makes you want to salivate at the thought of eating it, and the taste of the food just takes you elsewhere.",

I loved the crispy soft shell crab the first time I was here; while it was good this time, it was lacking a little something. However, I was blown away by the satay duck breast - beautifully pink and the peanut sauce was chunky and delicious. I would definitely choose this next time! My boyfriend was quite disappointed with the roast duck in a roti - this was filled with bland salad veg, which made it more like a lunch wrap than a delicate starter, and overpowered the duck. I had a beef rendang for my main, which was tasty if not spectacular - I'm not sure I think it's worth \u00a316.95, though admittedly there was enough for me to take away some for lunch the next day. My boyfriend was delighted with his pork belly, which looked moist and luxuriant.Like the crispy soft shell crab, I loved the Tom Yum Brulee last time, but this time it was a bit disappointing - the flavours were rather muted and not as striking as before. The plate was also piled with fruit that was a bit wet and unnecessary.The restaurant itself has a great vibe and looks interesting, with varied art and ornamental details. Things are served very prettily in general - I like details like having the sticky rice in a little basket.",

Although was slightly jealous when I went back upstairs to a buzzing restaurant which had a brilliant atmosphere, so like other reviews have said I would try to sit there next time!The mains we had were amazing - highly recommend the red snapper which had some gorgeous (but spicy) flavours, plus the pork belly and the lamb shank looked amazing. Looking forward to visiting again to try some different dishes!",

    "text": "This is one of these places where I left not knowing how to feel about it. Parts of it was great and others were just so bad that it should not at all be tolerated. Let's start with on of the good things; The place has a nice relaxed feel to it and we were right away shown to our table but then the not so good things start. Waiter shows up and asks us what we want to drink which is great - only mistake is that we have not received any menus. Easily fixed - we get drinks menu and piece of paper that is some sort of seasonal menu for Christmas. That was not mentioned when booking and since we did not really find anything on the seasonal menu we wanted - asked the waiter if they serve the regular menu and receives an affirmative answer. Another waiter comes over and explains that two dishes are out. Unfortunately one of the dishes I wanted was on that list (the beef rendang). Still after some contemplation we all manage to find something and orders, we also order drinks. Interestingly enough the beers that the menus states are bottles are just served in glasses no biggie but makes me suspicious. We also get some nice banana bread and spicy fruit salads while waiting for the food. Then the waiter showed up and told us (we were 3) that the dishes two of us ordered were actually not available and we had to order something else and also informed us that several other dishes were not offered either.The problem for me now was that none of the dishes were things I wanted to eat, I explained that to the waiter that there is nothing I like among the mains any longer and they should really tell when booking if there is only a limited menu offered. He just shrugged and said that is the way it is. No offer to adjust any of the dishes and he was very annoyed when I instead ordered another starter as I could not find anything among the mains. There was actually not even any apology or any offer to do anything solve the situation - if I would not already have ordered the beer and some of that I would rather have left and gone elsewhere.Food that we got was in general good but not fantastic, a lot of reuse of ingredients makes it feel a bit cheap. The lamb starter was the highlight on the evening. The pork belly was decent but nothing special. The venison rendang is better avoided while the duck starter is decent (but very similar to the lamb but the meat was not as good quality) and the goat cheese parcels were pretty decent.May still return once they stopped the seasonal menu and then also be prepared for the bad service. In general the starters appear to be better so may only go for several of those to share instead.",

This could be a nice room if it was cleaned up more. It's also very darkly lit. The seating area on the top floor was much nicer but unfortunately was not sat here. The food was ok- I enjoyed my main more than my starter. For my starter I had the Goat cheese parcels with lime dressing. It was served like egg-rolls. I did not think the flavors went very well together so would not recommend. For my main- I had the Baked fresh shitake & potato edamame dumpling with Szechuan peppercorn sauce. I got this with a side of sweet potato mash with spring onion. The main was very good and flavoursome as was the sweet potato mash. It is not a traditional thai restaurant is meant to be a fusion of Thai and Malaysian. If I come again- will insist on sitting in the area upstairs as the downstairs seating area is not nice.",

Starters here are excellent! \u00a0My scallops were out of this world, huge juicy things resting on pancetta and blades of fruit. \u00a0They were exquisite and could only have been improved if there had been once in each corner of the plate rather than one on either side. \u00a0I've never had scallops this good and I've eaten a lot of scallops. \u00a0The soft shell crab ordered by my friend were simultaneously soft, juicy and crunchy. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0We had sizzling steak in a peppercorn sauce and prawns in turmeric curry. \u00a0The steak was unfortunately a little chewy but the sauce was very pleasant. \u00a0There were only two prawns in the curry, but they were vast, vast as in the tails were about 6 inches long and two inches across. \u00a0To accompany this we ordered coconut rice and stir fried halloumi with chilli. \u00a0The halloumi side was quite perfect, one of the best side dishes I have ever had. \u00a0We shared a phenomenal dessert, tom yum creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0The most fantastic flavour combination since Wagamama started making white chocolate ginger cheesecake. \u00a0Just marvellous.We washed this all down with a bottle of Albari\u00f1o, which was OK, but a little on the sharp side and finished off with their filter coffee.This place just narrowly missed a fifth star due to the steak texture and the loneliness of the scallops. \u00a0That being said, I seriously recommend coming here. \u00a0It's a feast for the eyes and the mouth and a memorable experience.",

Or for the topless lady-horse statue with impressively perky breasts that sat behind my table.But, really, the 4 stars goes to the food. It was tasty and took some unexpected turns - creating an enjoyable, intimate evening meal. I particularly appreciated the number of vegetarian and vegan options on the set menu sat alongside steak and even ostrich.The d\u00e9cor of the restauarnt - while quirky, interesting and at times risqu\u00e9 - only added to the 4-star-ness of Champor Champor. The only thing that let me down was the fact that you could only order the set menu (at nearly \u00a330 for 2 courses); there was no a la carte option. After the bread, the canapes and the starter, I just wasn't at all hungry for the main course, tasty and enormous though it was. That night, gluttony did not become me. And the vague feeling of gastronomic failure That overcame me did not for a wholly pleasurable dining experience make.Still, Champor Champor was totally awesome. Come for the cow. Stay for the... cow*.________________________________________*steak - that is to say, food. But there is steak on the menu, yes. You might have to pay a \u00a33 supplement for it, though.

It was raw and uncooked, which I thought was impossible to do in this age of rice cooker technology.Overall, disappointed. It wasn't cheap either!
