The seating is limited, but we barely waited long. Portions were much larger than I anticipated, although after reading other reviews it seems that's the norm. The prices were fair and the service was good for this type of spot. And the lollipops at the end were a nice touch.",

I came here on a Sunday morning after the night before, and wasn't disappointed with my vegetarian breakfast. Instead of the usual 'substitute bacon and sausages for more beans and a tomato' nonsense that you usually get, these guys serve some top drawer mushrooms, excellent eggs and hash browns. The staff are friendly and quick, and all in all this is an affordable find in a slightly up-market area.",

This is the place you go when you'd like a huge amount greasy food after a night out. It's a local favourite, cosy, and the food is decent. I've tried the benedict and florentine with poached eggs. The poached eggs are often a bit weird, the egg white too firm. I suspect that the poached eggs are made in some kind of apple slice pan. The chef tends to drown the bread in hollandaise sauce so I suggest asking him to go easy on the sauce.All in all, the place is ok and decent, but in no way extraordinary. It's more the place you visit to afterwards tell your local friends 'ya, I was at Mike's last weekend'.",

    "text": "It's right across from that Notting Hills bookstore where you will find all the tourists gathered there. Mike's Caf\u00e9 is a great place for breakfast - I mean very traditional English breakfast... eggs, sausages/ham, bread (and more bread), maybe a little bit of tomato and mushroom. And that's about it.When I asked if I can have salads or green veggies, the waitress told me its salads and leaves are for decoration. But she was nice enough to bring me a small bowl of lettuce. I really appreciate that. London people may appear serious and sometime stiff, but they are actually very kind and thoughtful.",

Wait staff is good on part because they are so laid back and friendly. Were I nearby this would be a frequent stop. Track it down, you'll be glad you did. And! It's not expensive at all.",

Definitely worth a try if you are in the area. My friend had a coffee and said it was the best cup he's ever had. I loved traditional English breakfast, all around.",

I don't eat meat normally and the meat portion of an English breakfast will go to waste on me. However this place allows you to build your own breakfast from one item at \u00a32.10 to six items at \u00a0\u00a37.70. The service was friendly, and quick. It was very cozy as there was a working fireplace in the dining room. It was decorated with exposed brick and toile wallpaper. I sat next to the window so that I could people watch. What a perfect English breakfast experience for this American.",

You get to pick six items off the breakfast menu, and it comes with an orange juice, coffee or tea for \u00a39.95. I think it as incredibly reasonable for the neighborhood. The service was also good. It was a great place to be after spending the majority of the day shopping at Portobello Road market. I highly recommend this place for brunch. Plus - they take card, which is great for tourists like me! Also - free WiFi!!",
