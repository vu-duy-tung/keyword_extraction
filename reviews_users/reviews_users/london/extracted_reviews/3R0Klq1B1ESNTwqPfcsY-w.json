    "text": "Ah Pig and Butcher, I'd heard so many good things about you and you let me down so incredibly hard.Yesterday was my birthday. I was 32 and, having just moved to London leaving my wife and child temporarily up in Scotland, I went out for cocktails and dinner with my Mum. I spent some considerable time looking at dining options and plumped for the rather promising sounding Pig and Butcher. I'd booked for 8.30 to give us cocktail imbibing time before hand and we arrived around 8. An extremely friendly chap in a blue and white striped apron and a white shirt exploding with red flowers that made it look like he'd just come out of an episode of Dexter met us and propped us up at the bar until our table was ready.We had a glass of wine and sat and chatted while the pub part of The Pig and Butcher hustled and bustled around us. It was lovely actually. There were lots of full tables and drinks being drunk and food being eaten all around us. A plate of the most enormous scotch eggs I've ever seen sat on the bar and I began to get rather hungry. What a sad fool I was.Around eight thirty we were taken to our table by incredibly friendly and chatty staff who made sure we were happy and brought us wine and food menus and we both cast our eyes about the restaurant trying to catch glimpses of other people's choices. It all looked like simple but decent grub. We ordered and a short while later our starters arrived. I'd ordered mackerel with peri peri while my Mum had gone for Mrs Beeton's beetroot and egg salad. The starters weren't at all bad - both on the large side, especially the mackerel which came as a pair on the bone with some rocket. We'd also ordered a bottle of Albarino which was typically rather splendid.As our starter plates were whisked away I wondered whether the rest of the food would live up to all the hype and fuss. The starters had been good but by no means mind blowingly good and I had to admit that I was expecting more.Our main courses arrived, on white plates in a rustic fashion. I'd gone for pork steaks with black pudding panhaggerty and red cabbage while my darling Mater had opted for Cornish gurnard with celeriac salad and pickled girolles. Both dishes were soul crushingly disappointing. The pork steaks were tough and bland and looked undercooked. The panhaggerty had been sitting in a giant dish under a heatlamp on the serving counter for the entire evening and so the potato on top was dry and chewy while the bottom of the dish was soupy giving the black pudding an unpleasant texture. The best I can say is that the red cabbage, which cut through the richness of the black pudding, was pretty good. A few mouthfuls in and I whispered across the table \"This is really rather lacklustre\" and my dining companion whispered back \"So is this\". My Mum later described her dish as \"tasting like cottonwool on a bed of vinegary wood chips with pickled mushrooms thrown in\". This was not, at all, what either of us were expecting from the food. We both left large swathes of our plates untouched and skipped on pudding.Luckily our conversation was sparkling, the wine was excellent and the atmosphere was very enlivening so we had a good evening overall anyway. I am willing to admit that the kitchen may have been having an off night, although the presence of the slowly drying out panhaggerty dish makes me wary of really giving them the benefit of the doubt. In summary - great atmosphere, lovely staff and a great venue but, in all honesty, crap food.",

There are plenty of different elements to each dish, such as the pudding, sauces, potatoes and greens and all are done to perfection. It's a really nice atmosphere that most people can enjoy. Great for catching up with friends, a date and even families.",

    "text": "Ok so 3 of us went here on Saturday night and I have to say the food was very good. My steak was beautifully cooked as was the venison. Our starters of goose rillette, ham hock and a black pudding and coddled egg salad were all delicious. The only very minor gripe I had with the flavour of anything was the salsa verde that came with my steak. I thought it was very over seasoned and so salty I couldn't eat it, the others tried it and thought it was nice however so thats 2-1 against on that one. Okay, so I have given it a 4 and mostly deservedly so, but I have to say I thought the wine list was poor, we tried 2 different bottles one was \u00a342ish a Rioja (the most expensive red they did) and the other was around the \u00a332 mark, a French one. I have to say I wasn't enamoured with either, the French one was your typical Vin du Plonk and the Rioja stuggled to raise the standard on a Campo Viejo, not impressed. The service was not great either, to start off it was a bit forced, pouring our wine for us is a bit much for what is essentially a pub. This service eventually disintegrated to us having to almost grab her as she rushed past. Finally and most tellingly is the price, this gastro pub is undoubtedly in Angel as I'm sure only here in the land of the Islingtonites could you charge these prices and still be booked up regularly. I don't mind paying for quality food and lets not get this wrong they do what they do very well, but (and its a BIG but), what they do is very high end pub food, no more. The prices you pay for food in restaurants is determined as much by atmosphere as anything and I have to say they haven't quite got it right to be charging what is pushing the limits outside of the fine dining experience. My 40 day aged Hereford ribeye steak I can only assume must've put that time to good use with a correspondence course, gained a qualification in order to have more marketable skills and command a higher price in the marketplace, because at \u00a326.50 it must have more to offer than meets the eye. All in all it's a lot better than a lot of supposed gastro pubs but they definitely are pushing their luck a little with the prices, to me if I'm going to have a splurge I could've topped up the \u00a3175 bill by \u00a3100 and gone to a Michelin star place where the wine would be poured for me (a pet hate of mine, can you tell?) but at least I'd be expecting such pretensions.",

It seems the P&B has been \u00a0popular from day one when it opened so wanted to find out for myself.Inside it's split into a pub zone with small tables and a dining zone behind that. A relaxed and warm atmosphere inside got things off to a good start. Super attentive and friendly staff welcomed us and quickly found us to a table (we didn't have a booking). Beer menu has some good choices including a small selection of local craft beers which seems to be the requirement now...Food menu is solid British heritage with meat and fish themes.I ordered the monkfish scampi with garlic aioli for starters and my partner had the beetroot and egg salad. Both were great and ample. My main course of partridge with pan haggerty and girolles was excellent. The partridge being served in several portions, perfectly roasted and the haggerty (a kind of potato gratin) was just velvety smooth and creamy. Perfect with the partridge.Puddings weren't quite as good as the mains. My apple and pear crumble with ice cream was served in a single dish with a crunchy and slightly burnt crumble and wasn't that exciting and my partner's sticky toffee pud also did the job.The place is really well run and managed. Bustling, friendly and competent and the staff are really on the ball. Prices were OK given the high quality overall.",

    "text": "After writing this whole review, I feel the need to come back to the beginning and assure you that I do not work for this establishment. Yeesh, fan girl, settle down. There's not a whole lot I can say about this place that you won't already gather from reading their website and the reviews here. It is one of the few places that I love so much, I don't want to write a review and tell people about it. Judging from the crowd last Friday, though, word is plenty out, so it's time. Sometimes, you're just in the mood for quick and dirty pub food. Other times, you're in the mood for an amazing meal that is fresh, local, and cooked with tedious care. Pig & Butcher satisfies both of those cravings and takes everything to the next level. The menu changes from day to day, and I'll admit to stalking it out online even when I'm not planning on going there that day. Just to see what they're up to. There are always at least three dishes that leave me drooling. I haven't yet found anything that the chefs here don't do well, but will report back when and if I do. If you like venison, they do it pristinely. It's never overcooked and still juicy and delicious. There are bar snacks available if you're not sitting down for a full meal, and the beer selection is pretty fantastic. The staff is lovely and you're always given a pitcher of water for the table - a minor thing that makes me love a place even more. I drink a lot of water. Shut up.",

Incidentally I believe The P&B is new sibling to the well established Princess of Shoreditch and Lady Ottoline, with a similar outlook on the popular pub-meets-fine-dining of the traditional variety, yet in a most comfortable and casual manner.Expect to see all the British family mealtime classics served here yet with a contemporary touch and fresh outlook. The chalk boards illustrate the daily specials during the week and on Sundays, a choice of roast meals (including fish and vegetarian options) is offered. The craft been selection is fantastic, drink everything from the Hackney Brewery's tipples to ales from Bath straight from the tap.Inside you will feel as cosy and homely as you would in your great aunt's English country cottage with ad hoc oak tables and side boards arranged across two dining rooms. The outdoor benches exploit the westerly afternoon sun, perfect for just grabbing one of the many wonderful beers offered here.The personable antipodean proprietor who has also moved in upstairs has been doing to rounds, a very nice man who clearly knows what he is doing with his business, I wish him well and look forward to returning regularly.",

It isn't cheap, 1 appetizer, 2 main, 1 dessert and 1 drink was like 60+ pounds. We had the asparagus appetizer and it was yummy. The duck dish for main was magical. All of the fat is rendered out and the duck was excellent. We also had the hanger steak (onglet). It was good but I would happily switch for the duck if I could. The best dish in my opinion was the sticky date pudding for dessert. But I have been looking for it everywhere since I had it in Australia. It was divine and I would happily eat a second piece if I had room in my stomach. Overall great meal.",

Considering the extent to which I built up my expectations for this spot, that statement says a lot. Anyway, on to the food. We ordered the bread to start which came with delicious homemade butter (sea salt flakes included as dusting on top) and beef fat infused oil with rosemary (definitely not the technical term but I think you get the gist). I've never had anything like the beef fat infused oil and it was truly decadent and delicious. For the starter we split the asparagus which came with curds and hazelnuts. The asparagus was relatively simple (likely steamed asparagus) but definitely an interesting pairing. For our mains, I had the pork shoulder at the waiter's recommendation and my friend had the lamb rump. The pork shoulder was exquisitely tender and came with a great mustard-y sauce. The lamb was also very good and perfectly cooked, but I preferred the pork shoulder which had a bit more character in my opinion. For dessert, we split the chocolate sundae with a chocolate brownie and rum raisin and chocolate ice creams. Pretty expertly executed with walnuts and hot fudge on top. Other item to note: extensive beer menu with options on draught and a wide range of bottled beers from around the world. To round out the 5 star recommendation, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and most certainly contributed to Pig and Butcher's stellar performance!",

I would say almost yes, if I was rich I would probably go here more often. But alas it will have to be a treat once in a blue moon. I had the pig head starter, which sounds disgusting but was so mouth wateringly beautiful. Followed by the beef roast which was delicious and a rice pudding to finish which was unfortunately a real disappointment. After all that I felt just right in the stomach, not to full not to empty. I wish I could just have the roast beef dinner and be full but the portions are too small. So I have to go for the full whack which hurts my bank. There should possibly be the option of having a larger roast for a little more money, \u00a0I mean this is the reason we are going to this pub. Oh and two potatoes is taking the piss really come on they are cheap as chips! Quite literally.",

We ordered the roast chicken to share with all the trimmings and it was absolutely gorgeous! Roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and veg. The restaurant itself is really nice and would be a great place to bring your parents for a classy and satisfying meal. Can't wait to go back!",

We had more friends stop by near the end for drinks and they managed to move us inside to a larger (and warmer) table.I ordered the steak medium rare and it was delicious. The chips though were something else. \u00a0Double (maybe triple?) fried in some delicious animal fat made extra delicious with mayo. The one MUST order is the bread.

    "text": "Momma loves a roast and where better to go on a Sunday than one of the most popular and considered best pubs in Islington? Best because of food, not because of drinking ambience. In terms of a place to hang out and have a few drinks, go somewhere else, because this is a bit stuffy and really more of a restaurant. The Pig and Butcher is so busy on a Sunday with people clamouring for their well-loved roasts that we had to put our name down for a table and come back in an hour. It was well worth it though. Now this isn't a cheap roast, our entire meal came to over \u00a362, which is a lot more than I care to pay for Sunday lunch. We started by sharing the snails in bone marrow and whilst it was tiny, it was buttery and divine. I licked the plate a little, my boyfriend was less than impressed by this behaviour. We ordered one lamb and one sirloin roast. I usually go for the pork because I love crackling but they only had pulled pork on that day which isn't a roast to me. The lamb was tender and delicious and the vegetables were really fantastic. My only complaint was that they really didn't give enough gravy for such a giant Yorkshire and roast potatoes... Maybe it was because I licked the plate again, I don't know, whatever, don't judge me!",

My cousin decided to treat us out before we left. For a taste of traditional English pub food, he suggested the Pig and the Butcher because it was just down the street from his flat and had just recently opened. Apparently the name of the pub is due to the fact that they use all parts of the pig. My kind of place! We arrived for a Thursday night dinner with reservations and this place was packed! It seems the menu changes quite often. The interior is very cozy too. Like a restaurant. But loud like a pub! EntreesGoose rillettes w/ bread - Delicious! Where can I find this in LA?Blood sausage w/ arugula salad - Phenomenal. Been trying to find this too.MainsCornish Plaice w/ potatoes - Good.Venison pie - Awesome. Love venison!!!! Dessert:Raspberry lemon custard w/ cookies Sticky toffee pudding w/ ice cream By dessert I was stuffed. But it was all really good. Our meal also came with double crispy chips, which are french fries fried twice. AMAZING. So crispy. For drinks, I had a mixed fruit cider. I was so busy stuffing my face, I forgot to drink it all. All the portions were very generous. Service was good. No complaints. I think about this meal quite often. It made me fall in love w/ English food. I'm looking forward to the day when I can go back. =)",

    "text": "The menu changes (and is updated online) daily and consists of about 6 starters, 7 mains and 6 desserts. As you can assume from the above introduction, it all sounds delicious... On today's menu (26th March) there are dishes like Cornish sole scampi & aioli (\u00a37.25) and 40 day-aged Angus beef rib, Portobello mushrooms & double dipped chips for 2 to share (\u00a328.50 pp).On the day we went there was a Pulled pork burger, which we both couldn't resist and delivered big on flavour as well as being a generous portion of juicy, slow cooked pork. We also had dessert, an Apple Crumble and a Treacle Tart. Again, both were superb. As well as great food, they have an excellent beer menu with a range of craft beers such as BrewDog 5am Saint, Brooklyn IPA and Goose Island Honkers as well as hand pulled ales, including Dark Star and Meantime.Very impressed with The Pig & Butcher overall. It's maybe a little pricey to go to often, but it's a great place to know of when you're in the mood to spend a little extra and you can rest assured, it'll be worth it and they have the right philosophy of sourcing great produce as locally as possible.",

We had reservations to go on a Saturday evening and I was immediately impressed by the quick, friendly service and the homey, relaxed ambience. We felt like we were eating in someone's beautiful home. Even though the place was packed, it was spacious. The decor is simple with lots of wood finishings, there's even blankets for you if you get too cold but it gets really warm inside so definitely dress in layers. We sat near the open kitchen and we really enjoyed watching all the dishes coming and going. Their menu is meat-focused: starter bread comes with pork fat and their appetizers are amazing, especially their carpaccio. I got the pork belly and my boyfriend got the angus, both very heavy dishes. So I suggest getting only one appetizer and maybe the bread because I could only finish half my main. My boyfriend said even though the Angus was good, he wished he got something else. But I really loved the pork belly. It came on a bed of beans and everything was done just right. Definitely try their Belgium beers if you want quality beer... I loved their mulled wine. We stayed for a good couple hours before meandering home, which was good to walk off the full belly. It's a step away from the heart of Angel so if you have the energy to go somewhere after, this gastropub is the perfect place to go. I would definitely come back here, with friends from out of town. It will give them an iconic, memorable experience of a British pub :)",

The sitting area is chic rustic with wooden tables etc. the draft beer selection was good, and the Pinot noir wine paired well with the roasts. However for a place with peers such as smokehouse and the princess of shore ditch, I was expecting more. I ordered the roast pork, which was good if lacking a little flavor, and it was large enough to share with my wife. My family was in town and among them we also got the lamb and the beef. The beef looked good although very standard. I tried the lamb and it was alright, although not very tender for the cut it was (it was not roast lamb shank) We also ordered Eton mess, but the merengue was a bit soggy. Still classic tasting. So far a three and a half star review. But then given some missed orders of drinks and their refusal to just serve a scotch egg( as oppose to ordering the whole appetizer platter) I have to round down. Overall I would say I'd go back but to be fair I would rather return to the princess of shoreditch or to smokehouse for a proper upscale roast. Additionally there are many other Gastropubs in islington to try. Maybe I went on an off day.",

Let me begin with the caveat that I was bringing along a less than willing companion - It was my night to decide where we were going to eat, and after looking around for some good reviews for a neighborhood-ish spot, I convinced my partner that we would need to try Pig and Butcher. But, after reading all of the below reviews, I bet you can guess who walked away the evangeliser. This guy doesn't even like mushrooms and was grilling the waitress on what kind/when/how they were sourced. It was just that good.We started out with a couple drinks at the bar before making our way to seating outside. \u00a0For beer drinkers, the selection on draft and in bottle is big - I've been less of a beer drinker myself lately, but was happy with what appears to be a daily changing cocktail list and had a little aperol sptriz.Since we decided last minute to dine and the place was buzzing, we couldn't get a seat straight away but the staff was accommodating and quickly found us a table outside once it opened up. Most importantly, the food is delicious - All locally sourced and seasonal. An exciting prospect to think that everytime you come here you could be eating something else.If you're looking for outdoor seating closer to Angel station without having to sit along the busy Upper Street, walk just a little bit more into the neighborhood and you won't be disappointed. My only regret was being too full for dessert.",

    "text": "Forgive me because we went to the Pig & Butcher about 5 months ago and their menu changes quite frequently so I can't fully comment anymore on what exactly I had to eat.However I do remember it was absolutely amazing. Me and my girlfriend went there on a Saturday night and started with a cold rabbit-based pate that came with fresh bread. This was heaven in my mouth and to be honest the best dish I had there. As a main I had the sirloin steak which was really good, but I'm a bit ashamed I didn't try something more original as you can find steak at lots of places and there are a lot more interesting items on the P&B's menu.Obviously, almost all dishes are meat-based so do only go there if you like meat as much as I do. They also serve a few really good Belgian beers which go really well together with the meats.Absolutely recommended!",

    "text": "It took seven weeks of living in England to experience a PROPER Sunday Roast, but I think I finally did it at The Pig and Butcher. Three of us had a pork roast, pea soup with ham, a duck egg with mushrooms, stuffed and fried courgette blossom (that's zucchini, friends), and a beautiful fish filet, along with bloody marys, and it was all exactly what we wanted and perfectly executed. DO make a reservation if you're planning to go on a weekend. We didn't have one and got there just as they opened so we did just fine, but the place filled up within 20 minutes and non-reservers were left waiting (and waiting and waiting, as this is still England, where service is not manically expedient like it is in New York) or sitting outside. But anyway, loved it, will be back.",

Thankfully we had reservation and was seated immediately after our arrival. We recommended making reservation. The staff was very friendly and helpful. But the food was the star. The had the beef and lamb roast. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The accompanied vegetables were fresh and delicious. The dessert was very freshening and not overly sweet.",

There was a time limit on my table since it was quite busy, but they accomodated me nonetheless.The beef itself was exquisite, but the trimmings were of varying quality - the double (or triple?) cooked potatos were of great texture but needed more salt. So did the leek in cream. The carrots were a bit undercooked. The yorkshire pudding was pretty decent, a bit soggy in the centre but that's probably due to it being massive.The damage wasn't too high as well, and the atmosphere is nice.",

However, I did not find that my food was worth a 5 star review as I had better steak in the US. I had the Angus onglet and it was great, not fantastic but great. The chips were more like yucca, and I love yucca, but something between chips and yucca is kind of strange, so, let's deduct a point for that as well. My starter was the mac and cheese and it was not great. They decided to kill the dish by putting broccoli inside and that simply does not pair well with mac and cheese. The wine list features great labels but kind of short on bubbles. If there is one thing which is fantastic at this restaurant is the BREAD! It is to die for! And the butter... oh my Goodness!! What's that!One dislike... the service overall.... it was not terrible but it wasn't great. We were told that we had 2 hours to have dinner as the table we were sitting was in high demand therefore our time there was limited. Found this to be extremely rude and unprofessional so another star off for that.",

    "text": "My husband has been wanting to visit the Pig and Butcher for a long, long time and on what I'm dubbing \"the last day of summer 2015,\" we did just that... but for drinks only. The last day of summer 2015 was on a Saturday, by the way.Our one and only issue with the Pig and Butcher was that we arrived before the menu was available which meant we had arrived well before any type of food would be served. So what time did we arrive? Well, we arrived around 4:30 or 5pm as part of our Bike 'n Beer tour of Islington. All we wanted were some nibbles and none were available, so we opted for beers and sunshine with hope that nibbles would be available soon after arriving (they weren't).The same problem exists with the Pig and Butcher as does the Hop & Berry which is that their picnic tables are located on the same main road which is busy, so you constantly feel like you are being hit in the face with exhaust from cars zooming by. The space inside is nice. Decorated like a cute pub, one that would seem cozy in the winter.Service (at the bar, of course) was great. Smiley and happy to serve everything aside from food. At one point, a server brought around sunscreen to everyone seated at the picnic tables outside which I thought was a noble gesture!Would totally return to the Pig and Butcher but after 6pm - or whenever they start dinner service - for grub.",

I read gastro pub and K was hooked.It took us quick a journey to get to the Pig and Butcher in Angel (it's quite a walk from the station, very easy to find but a bit far) but I had no regrets.When we arrived without a reservation we were sat at the bar in the meantime because a table was paying their bill. It turned out to take ages because the people at the able decided to hang around. As our group grew impatient, the staff finally decided to politely explain to them to leave.The meal was succulent. I mean it : succulent. The products are fresh and locally sourced. In fact, there's a big chalkboard map on a wall detailing were all the meat, fish and vegetables are from in England. Our waiter was lovely and helpful. The only dark side is all the waiting while eating. We basically waited almost an hour between dishes. I know we're here to relax and enjoy our time at dinner but it was too much, my family grew impatient and mostly hungry. Obviously the quality of our meal and our lovely waiter made up for it but it was testing our patience. I would go again",

    "text": "A lovely, cozy meal!With a fresh updated menu daily, the Pig & Butcher takes great pride in the simplicity (and locality) of its food. This corner pub-looking shop caught my eye on a recent walk around the area a few weeks ago, and this past week I finally had the opportunity to treat a lovely coworker. I do suggest a reservation (even for a small group of 2!) as we were only able to get in at 8:30pm. The hostess was very polite on the phone and we were treated like welcome guests upon arrival and throughout the meal. My glass (ok, 2) of the Tempernillo was absolutely divine. Warmed me right up and soothed my schedule-battered spirit quickly. They have a nice selection of wines from around the world by the glass, half carafe and bottle. As for the menu...as it changes daily, I can't comment too much on what me be available today, but I can say that the goose rillettes with cornichons and the root vegetable plate as starters were EXCELLENT. Maybe even better than our main dishes. Absolutely lovely. The bread basket and fresh butter also a nice treat to start. We also split the pork with greens (a bit average, but still good) and the whole fish which luckily my dining companion filleted and de-boned without issue. The puddings? Well, icing on the gastropub cake, if you will. We had the chocolate with peanut butter ice cream. Very rich, not entirely memorable...but passable, especially paired with a fresh roasted Americano and hot milk. From the Pig & Butcher site: \"We have brought the pub back to it's roots and receive carcasses straight from the farm and butcher on site. \u00a0We specialise in rare breeds such as White Park cattle, Iron Age pigs and Hebridean lamb while our good friend Seb at Chart Farm in Kent supplies our game - if you haven't tried his venison you are missing out!\"Will definitely add to the date night/fun night rotation. It's cozy, a bit off the beaten path, good food, warm ambience, people laughing and conversing, and a really friendly staff...at a price. At nearly 100 GBP for the two of us, it won't come cheap. But, you get what you pay for...",

    "text": "I have known this pub to be called a few names in its time. The most recent being The Islington Tap. Each makeover has maintained consistency in providing a good local friendly pub with hearty food. The Pig & Butcher has taken it a step further though, choosing to steer clear of the go-to options such as burgers, fish & chips etc and instead, offer what is surprisingly inventive and indeed the epitome of what a gastro pub should be. I know most folk believe \"gastro\" is over-used, maybe even a thing of the past. I believe, when used under the right circumstances, i.e. the bridge a between bog standard pub and fine-dining restaurant, it fits.It is off the beaten track, when you think of Upper Street being just down the road. Instead, it is surrounded mostly by residential neighbours and you can see this by the lack of office types propping up the bar. On a Friday night, there is a chilled crowd of locals tucking into game and such, or sipping on the beers, of which they have at least 30 types. It's a win win situation.For the food, I had Guinea Fowl breast and leg, with crunchy brussel sprouts. Yum! My friends were not to hungry so opted for a chunky chips, pig in blankets and a scotch egg to share. Now before I talk about my main, lets visit the scotch egg. It is not your normal cold uninspiring fare from Tesco. This is freshly made with egg that has the yoke spilling out like a yellow slow motion waterfall as it should. A big yes. Now the Guinea Fowl, omg the meat was tender. Whilst it is normally known to be drier and leaner than chicken, it had a moistness which was delicious. Partnered with crunchy bitter sprouts, the trip down to the other end of Theberton Street was worth it.The overall experience was delightful. Pricing was good. Service chilled but attentive. A good mix of table service or being able to go up to the bar if you fancy a look at the selection of bottle and tap beers. The pub has grit, it makes a statement that it can leave your Upper Street alternatives in its dust as it speeds off with food and drink goodness. We will be back!",

A warm and friendly welcome, great food, wine and a fine selection of birthday presents. We ate a steak ( the best since last year's visit to Argentina apparently!), lamb and plaice. Everything was delicious and all of us hankered after someone else's plate...a good sign of good food. Desserts were sticky toffee, chocolately moussy loveliness and a cheese plate complete with a birthday candle. This is a place for a treat. It costs but my goodness it does what it does really well.",

    "text": "I had meant to go check The Pig & Butcher for ages and finally came around to do it last week. And I can tell you one thing: I'll be back there soon! The food is simply delicious and quite fairly priced. I mean, it sure isn't cheap (something like 30+/person with a drink) but considering the quality of ingredients, it really just makes sense. As for most places, you actually get what you paid for, and here you get excellent quality ingredients cooked really well. Out of the starters, my favourite was the cod brandade, which was perfectly balanced, and served pipping hot with the best crispy toasted bread I've ever had. The chicken rillette was very good too, but missed that extra little thing to make it absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, they had run out of pork on the night we visited (I suppose that's the perks of late dining...) but both the lamb and the fish dishes we had were excellent. Desserts were really succesful as well (tip: if you spot something along the lines of brul\u00e9e rice pudding on the menu, GET IT! You can thank me later).Really glad we've finally made our way there and to have such a gem in our neighbourhood!",

Normally I would give it a 5 star review, but the dessert really let it down. I ordered the cobbler and I have to say the topping was not great. The topping was make separately and set on top and was so thick it made the dessert difficult to eat. Did not rank high on the taste counter as well. That said, the fruit inside was lovely.",

I walked down a quiet street to this pub, and thankfully it wasn't too busy when I came in. There's a great beer selection on tap, and the bartender was nice enough to give an easy recommendation for an American. ;)This is a great place if you have any allergies-first thing when I sat down my waiter asked if I had any allergies which I really appreciated. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food that seems to be here, but I wasn't hungry enough to justify a full dinner. I tried to make a dinner of two sides, but I don't think I'd recommend that route. The sides here truly don't make a dinner, and although it worked I think I should have just swallowed the slightly higher prices for dinner and have gone for it.If you are staying in the area, I think this is the perfect place to have a lovely drink and a great pub dinner!",

We hadn't thought to make a reservation in advance, so we planned to get there early for less of a wait. However, our jet lag was worse than we anticipated, so we ended up there mid-afternoon with a 1.5 hour wait. It was absolutely worth it though, and the staff was really friendly and accommodating.The Pig and Butcher focuses on locally sourced, sustainable ingredients, and the quality of the ingredients is evident in all of the dishes. For the roast, I got the slow roasted pork shoulder, and it was probably the best pulled pork I have ever had. This just tasted like comfort food and made me so happy. The roast came with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, creamed leeks, and vegetables, and each was excellently executed. We also got the board as an appetizer which was good, especially the Scotch eggs, but not necessary in retrospect as the roast was plenty of food and extremely satisfying.We would absolutely return to The Pig and Butcher for either Sunday roast or the regular menu. The entire meal was pretty much perfect, and left us with such great memories.",

The bread appetizer is fantastic starter with the beef drippings. We had the Lemon Sole was so delicious! Flaky and flavorful. The cod was also very very good. The kitchen made as little mistake on the Angus Beef entree and over charred the outside so it wound up tasting burnt. I told or waiter and he relayed it to the kitchen and they graciously gave us a free desert, which was very nice. They have a nice selection of ciders, which the women in our party enjoyed. I had a Guinness which went very nicely with the fish. Would definitely come back here again. 11/05/17: went back here with other members of our family who missed the first trip. Another set of brilliant dishes including Pulled Pork appetizer, Hoggette (lamb) and roast chicken for two. The lamb was so tender and moist it melted in my mouth! My wife and daughter loved the chicken for 2 although it needed a lot of sauce since it was a bit dry. Try the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale for nice treat if you lot dark beer.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved this place. Just what you want for a nice Sunday roast I think.Firstly, the great experience started over the phone. I'm not as organised as some when it comes to booking and so I called at 10am on Sunday and asked if we would be able to go for lunch at all. She explained that they booked only half the tables online and left he rest open for same-dayers. LOVE that. She suggested coming at noon or earlier and snagging one for these 'open tables'. Did just that and we were given a table in the middle of the room straight away, it had a bit of a draft but as it wasn't too cold today it didn't matter. I'm guessing the perk of booking in advance is that you get a 'better' table in the more dining rather than pub area.Next up we get some water, choose a wine and ask out waiter if ordering the mixed board starter plus brisket will be enough for 3 or if we should get extra sides. In a refreshing moment of honesty and not trying to upsell us, he told us that he thought it would be enough but we were welcome to order extra later. Thank you. It was more than enough and the 3 of us left stuffed.So onto the food, being now charmed with the decor and staff, I was really excited to to try the famous roast and starters.Mixed board was lovely, varied and creative. Came with some crispy toasted bread-crackers but we got extra bread for good measure (excellent butter) I personally really loved the venison terrine and the pork belly? Taramasalata also super tasty. Scotch egg perfectly runny.For the our main we opted for the beef brisket which needs to be ordered by at least 2 people to share at \u00a317 per person I think. This comes with 2 giant Yorkshire puddings, spring greens, some carrots, gravy, 4-5 roast potatoes and buttered leeks.It was excellent. Well cooked, enough gravy and the meat was succulent. Definitely will be returning to try more items on the menu. Couldn't try dessert bc as I said, we were stuffed!Whole affair with 1/2 bottle of wine and service came to 90 or so. Fab place.",

    "text": "A charming gastropub with top-notch service and an amazing selection of craft beers (I recommend trying the Beavertown Gamma Ray pale ale, though err admittedly I asked for the one in the most colourful can I could see rather than from any great beer knowledge!). Not a cheap feed by any means but a good option for the 'slightly special' meal category.They have a handful of picnic style tables and benches outside to enjoy the evening sunshine - and spy though the windows at other people's food. After a pre-drink (or two) we went in for dinner and started on the tasty homemade sourdough straight away, served with beef dripping.I chose the rabbit rillettes for starters but got massive food envy of the cheddar and bacon mac n' cheese (I know I know, it was obvious right). My Angus onglet main was nice though slightly charred; I ended up tasting some of the T-bone that the two of the guys were sharing and struggling with (I'm a helpful soul you know) which was far more tender. The lemon posset made for a nice fresh finish (as did the champagne one of my companions got a little carried away in ordering at the end of the meal).The staff were sometimes tricky to catch the eye of but they did a stellar job handling our big group, and certainly very quick to bring more wine bottle refills over! The pub itself is a lovely airy space and I especially liked the blackboard detailing where they source all their meat from. Bonus points for having coat-hooks too. Thanks for having us!",

Anyways, we got one of the special roasts for 4 and even though it was pricier than I had expected, it was definitely worth it. The amount of food was overwhelming and the meat, sauce, vegetables, and sides were delicious! Our server was great and recommended great drinks for us... he even brought out bread for us to sop up some of the residual sauce at the bottom of the pan... All in all, people say this is the place to go for Sunday roast and they're not lying. Try it once... you won't be sorry!",

The owner(?) / manager (?), (didn't get his name) was very accommodating considering we showed up w/o a reservation on a Sunday night for classic Sunday Roast supper. Closest underground is Angel station. \u00a0Hope this post helps!",

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews, I was really looking forward to my first dining experience in London.The venue was cool, rough wooden tables, paced with people and an army of waitresses running around. Your first impression is that this is a hip and popular place. (And I, aged 30something, was a bit to old for this pub!) But regardless, it's a really nice place, but loud.I arrived London only one hour before our table reservations, in a delayed flight, so I was really ready to get something to eat, and we quickly decided on what we wanted from the menu.Starters as the vegetarian option, panzanella, crispy halloumi and fried crispy lamb was served, and the salad was weird, the halloumi was deep fried, but cold, and the also cold, fried cooked egg white was chewy and quite weird tasting.The fried lamb was more like a sheep nuggets, and tasted like a old wet sheep. Our expectations now (after the starters) were actually higher for the main course, we ordered angus beef sirloin and lamb shank. The sirloin was perfectly cooked on the inside, but had been grilled so the outside was blackened by charcoal, and this really messed up the flavor. Sadly.The lamb was really good, and cooked to perfection!I also ordered a Bellini as an aperitif, but this pub did not know how to make drinks! The peach juice tasted like something from a can, but my latest Bellini was in Venice, so maybe my expectations were too high! I really and truly wanted to love this charming pub. I loved the atmosphere and the interior design. But the service of the staff was not the greatest, the food was disappointing (except the lamb shank!) I would not recommend this place to anyone except to go here and have a beer with your mates, not for a meal.",

Menu changes daily and these guys have their own butcher. They also have a large selection of craft and imported beers as well and what looked like a promising wine list. Half the seats are up for grabs via online reservation. Rest can be grabbed on a first come first served basis. Call ahead. Portion sizes are v.generous (and I'm a big eater!). Patrons were a mix of locals and expats.Repeat: YesGreat way to polish off our last meal in London",

    "text": "Thoroughly professional establishment here. A proper gastropub that was packed at opening at 12pm.I had booked us a table for the famous roast. Because we are such adventurous foodies, after a little thought we went for a roast lamb, sirloin beef and pork.We didn't have to wait long. Maybe 20 mins. They knew what they were doing and all went smoothly. Including a very good Bloody Mary which I needed.In terms of preferable we all loved the beef and pork best I reckon. The lamb was very good too. It's actually my fav meat normally but the pork (pulled) was of great portion and very succulent. The sirloin soft like butter and nice medium rare and juicy.Great roast potatoes with good veg and a side for all of creamed leaks.I will Defo come back. Even spotted a ridiculously good bone marrow all lines up at the pass being soaked in juices. Looked insane.All in all....We came, we saw, we conquered. And we were happy!",

The Sunday roast is absolutely great. I ordered the one with lamb and there was so much food and I couldn't finish(I would love to tho). I will suggest to book first but they only open half the tables for booking so you might need to book early. I will say it's not too expensive as well. I will definitely go there again.",
