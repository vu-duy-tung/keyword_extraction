I went for brunch to avoid the lunch time rush, which I've been told is crazily busy as you can't make reservations. The menu has been very cleverly put together, the main menu starts at 11am till close and offers so many chooses regardless of the time of day. They also have a good looking separate breakfast menu before then. I went for the pulled pork kimchi hash. It was great. Not too much kimchi which was good so you could actually taste all the other ingredients, which did work together. Perfectly cooked still runny egg on top. If you're in a hungry mood you may want to get a few sides to share or throw on an extra egg as the dishes aren't huge. However, they are very reasonably priced for what you get. Staff are also really attentive and friendly. A must try! (Visit - 04/03/2015 Brunch)",

    "text": "I've been dying to visit Bad Egg, so when I was in London recently, I was able to meet up with the Brunch Club and sample a few dishes! I love egg of all sorts, so this was pretty much right up my alley. \u00a0On the weekends, you can order a la carte, or sample 3 brunch dishes with bottomless drinks (\u00a322 for nonalcoholic drinks, or \u00a332.50 for bloody marys, mimosas or cava).. so naturally, we went for the bottomless boozy brunch. \u00a0My fiance and I shared 6 (tiny) dishes between us: Chilaquiles (nachos) - one of my favorite items, I liked the goat curd saucekorean rib tips - to be honest, i don't remember much about this one other than the piece I ate was a bit overcookedsambal telur (deep fried egg) - tasty, but the yolk was a bit overdonecheeseburger hash - I liked the idea of this, still fond of this dish but needs improvement. \u00a0There were 2 little crumbles of minced meat, which was a bit dry and it was served lukewarm.french toast with fried chicken banana and maple syrup - good, but chicken was a bit overdonepulled pork with beans and kimchi on toast - probably my favorite itemOverall, I wasn't too impressed because I'm still scratching my head at how this is all supposed to be filling for \u00a332.50. \u00a0I thought the food better be pretty damn good for 3 tiny dishes. \u00a0But then of course, the unlimited drink.. I know this has been mentioned a few times in other reviews, but the service was pretty crappy that day. \u00a0I know we were a large group, but if they are able to accept the reservation, they should be able to accommodate us, service-wise. \u00a0It did take forever for the first round of drinks to come out, and refills weren't done often, we had to keep trying to flag them done. \u00a0After talking to the server and manager, she did ask us what they can do to make us happy, and brought out a round of pickle backs. \u00a0Anyhow, looking back at the menu, I'd probably just come here and order off the regular menu (where you'd probably get a regular sized dish), and share with a few people. I really don't feel like their boozy brunch option offers you much, unless you're really just in it to drink as much as you can. \u00a0But I mean, there are lots of other decent boozy brunch places for the same price (but more food!), so I'd rather go there. \u00a0I'll come back, but only to try the regular stuff off their menu.",

Despite losing our reservation - which you pay \u00a310 per diner to reserve! - our miniature three meals were all very good. It was American food - think burgers, cheese sauce, tacos, fried chicken on pancakes with maple syrup - so think fat and flavour over refinement. But they were filling and deliciousness and our prosecco glasses were speedily topped up. My negative is that the metallic interior and music meant it was super noisy - so you can only really talk to the people right next to you. But as a brunch 'experience' over a relaxed brunch, Bad Egg is just the ticket.",

When I splurge my stomach space on greasy food, it better be worth the pain the next day.We ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was a creamy amalgam of eggs, chorizo, guac, and salsa. I love huevors rancheros and this version was a bit underwhelming but at least better than the Shakshouka. The Shakshouka tasted more like salsa, lacking a punch of flavor and topped with undercooked poached eggs. \u00a0The Korean tacos were lackluster as well but the Buffalo Pork Rib was the best of the bunch, with a crispy exterior and tender meat. It's half bone, so it's less scary of a feat to finish than you think.Rice Crispy sandwich with Dulce de Leche ice cream was an interesting concept but didn't work too well when executed. The rice crispy was a bit tough and the ice cream barely softened it up.Overall it's an ambitious setting but there were quite a few disappointments.",

Chilaquiles were basically tortilla chips with a few toppings (including an egg, of course). \u00a0The pork belly was the worst, encrusted in some deep fried coating, and just too greased. The portions were small, but heavy. Service was very friendly, which ups my rating. The atmosphere is trying a bit too hard, but that's okay. Only wish the food was better.",

I was excited by their menu as they had huevos rancheros AND chilaquiles for reasonable prices for London, but it was not at all what I expected. The bloody Mary's started the meal off to a good start with a lemon and house made pickle and I was so hopeful for the mains. They came out and they were shockingly small! The huevos rancheros was creamy but there was only a small chorizo sausage and a small side bowl of tortilla chips. The chilaquiles were nothing like any I've had before. It was basically a bowl of tortilla chips with some chilies, a bit of guacamole, and a fried egg. Chilaquiles is my a favourite and this was just sad. I gave them three stars as the atmosphere is cute and the playlist was cool. I bet it would be fun to come here at night for some drinks but for food I wouldn't come here again.",

    "text": "Infinity Brunch Club Outing #7: Bad EggFor the seventh outing of our brunch club, we opted to go for something slightly cheaper. A lot of people had heard about Bad Egg, so we decided to go here. I made the booking well in advance, so they knew we had a large party coming...We arrived early, and our table was still occupied. Okay fine, but when the time for our booking came around (2 pm), our table was still occupied. Instead of moving other completely empty tables together that could have held our party, they insisted on making us wait for our table, so we were seated slightly late. Okay fine, but then we were left waiting another 15 minutes without a server coming by at all. So we sat there for 15 minutes with no booze, no water and no attention. This wasn't starting out well...When the server finally came around, we ordered our food. The deal is this: For \u00a332.50, you get unlimited bloody marys, cava and mimosas, plus three breakfast items. I opted to start with the bloody mary to give it a try, because I do love a good BM, but definitely wanted to switch to Cava. After about five minutes, the server brought out the Cava and Cava glasses (and unfortunately a very dirty glass for my partner, who had to send it back). It took a lot longer to get the BMs, even though there was clearly a pitcher sitting on the bar when we arrived. Not amusing. They also brought out what looked to be Champagne saucers, but really just turned out to be margarita glasses. Heh. We had to ask for water several times before any showed up.When the Bloody Marys finally arrived, I drank mine so quickly because I was thirsty (and also it took ages). It was actually a really good one, with a nice kick of spice at the end which is definitely the way I like it.The first few rounds of drinks took quite a long time, but it did start speeding up. By we were already annoyed. The food was actually really good. I had the cheeseburger hash, the chilaquiles and the french toast with chicken, banana and maple syrup. The hash was rich and luscious. The chilaquiles were slightly spicy. All the eggs were cooked nicely. The french toast was decadent although a bit of my chicken was slightly overcooked. My partner got the hash as well and the sambal egg and the korean rib tips (which I had to point out several times to other people were \"just the tip\"). They were also really tasty. Someone ordered the pancake with maple syrup and it was the tiniest pancake I had seen. That really wasn't okay, who makes pancakes so small? Given it was just with maple syrup, they probably should give at least two. I mean I'd understand if it came with bacon or anything else for that matter, but it didn't.A few people opted to get dessert (for extra), and there were both the rice krispy ice cream sandwich and the chocolate bowl on the table. The caramel rice krispy thing was waaaaay too sweet, but the chocolate bowl is really delicious.So we're drinking and having a good time until close to our two hours is up and we ask for more Cava, and are then told very aggressively and loudly that our two hours was up. My partner pointed out that he did kind of ignore us for the first half hour we were there, and he stormed off. He brought back more Cava, but seriously that wasn't okay. We asked for the bill, but decided the 12.5% service charge was too much, so got that removed to pay about half of it (due to the lack of service at the beginning and the server blowing up in our faces). Then when we're paying, he gets into a length and awkward argument with my partner about why it wasn't his fault the service was bad. Dude, we don't care. Just let us pay and do better next time. Even the manager noticed as after the argument had been going on for awhile, as she came by to ask if there was a problem. I quickly mentioned they were having a conversation about the service, and she disappeared to get us some free pickleback shots. It was a nice gesture, but it's a bit too late for that, as things should really have never gotten to that level to start with.So overall I wasn't too amused with brunch. The food was great, but the service was bordering on offensive. Which is a disappointment, because it was a good value for money, but if they just had service to go with it, instead of people who ignore you and yell at you, I'd probably be back. Now it's just that place we tried that one time and are never going back to again.",

The service was super friendly, and the guy behind the counter recommended the puked pork burger or the spicy ribs. As is my silly way after asking for recommendations, I picked something else entirely and went for the cheeseburger hash. Good lord this messy treat is good! Unfortunately I'm a bit of a wuss when it comes to meat and I like it so cooked that there is no way it could stroll off my plate, so I did have to push my burger meat to the side as it was merely superficially tanned rather than being cooked through... But the potato, cheesy sauce, mustard, onions, pickles, soft fried egg and addition of supplied ketchup and mayo really satisfied my munchies, and I have no doubt that they would happily cook the meat more for me when I return... Which I definitely will do! Plus it was only \u00a38.50 and all came in a cute bag with plastic cutlery. Next time, dessert as well (an icecream rice crispie treat sandwich with salted caramel?! Hell yeah!).",

    "text": "One star and that is because I can't give less!This is the worst place I've been for brunch lately.I can't comment about the food because we didn't have any. I can't comment on the drinks because we didn't have any!We had a booking on a Sunday for a birthday celebration at 2:30 pm. We arrived early and were asked to wait. Fine, no problem. It was only 2:15 pm when we arrived. We waited by the bar, completely ignored, but we were fine for that, We were waiting for the bottomless brunch.Suddenly people started to arrive. Ok, so the first round of brunches is finished and it is time for the second round. At 2:30, we were asked again if we had a booking. We said yes and were asked to wait again. It would be only 10 more minutes they said... They started to sit people in no order at all.We asked if our table was ready. Still nothing. It would be only 10 more minutes... More people arrived and were seated and we were still waiting... 10 minutes later, the host came to us and asked to wait a bit longer because the people didn't like the table and they had to move them so we could sit. WTF was that? Not my fucking problem!At 2:50 pm, we were still waiting. I think we were the only people left to be seated of all the 2:30 pm bookings. The host and the waiters still completely ignoring us, no apologies.In the end, we left very disappointed. I've never been in such a disorganized place in my life and to be honest, even though I was very excited to try their food as I've heard good things, I don't think I'll ever give them another try...",

I didn't get to try her dish but mine was a cheesy pool of goodness although the flavours didn't particularly knock me off my chair.

We arrived at 7.50 thinking there'd be a massive queue however it was empty! We were 5thish in the queue however just past 8 it got pretty hecticThe service was quick and they were so friendly even tho it was all freeWe both got pbj and fried chicken bun which was sooo good!

    "text": "Not impressed...I found the Bad Egg in a listing of London's best brunch...I really can't see why. For the purpose of this review, bear in mind I am talking about their brunch formula of 3 courses, not the a la carte menu.First the service was slow, very slow...We waited maybe 15 minutes for a waiter to come and ask for our drinks, not even our food choices...and then we waited again a long time to order our food. I didn't check the timing but I think we waited more than 30 minutes (if not more) to have the food served, and by looking around us we were not the only one...but they were really quick to remove our plates from the table!This could have stopped here, but what a disappointment when the food arrived. I have no issues with the idea of tapas sized dishes for brunch, but this has to be done well...and this was really not the case. The granola was very tiny but probably the best part (I just don't get why they couldn't bring it before to make us wait), then I had the guacamole on toast which were OK but not spectacular, and then the french toast which was not the best, really and drown under jam...I think my friend was even more disappointed than me for her food, she had the cheeseburger hash, which consisted of an already cooked for hours steak (and probably re-cooked), potatoes, a slice of square cheddar and an egg...a bit more work in the presentation could be nice, and the pancake had a greasy taste, she didn't finish it!I would certainly not recommend the brunch here...yet again I am speaking of the brunch menu, not a la carte...maybe this bit is better, but I don't think I will take the risk to come back to try...",

Would not recommend.Located lost in the middle of the city, the place is definitly cute (lovely ladies toilets actually!!) but thats it. Not impressed by the food at all. They offer a choice of three course to pick from a selection of about 10 dishes (tiny meals, really not particularly generous. The pancakes is ONE pancake, the french toast is half a toast...). The best dish i had were the cheesy fries with a fried egg - whislt beind really tasty is not really why i go to brunch for! The rest was very average. What could have saved the day would have been bottomless drinks... But no, disappointed again. Stuck to bloody marys all brunch, had 5. Should have been rolling on the floor drunk (im a particular light weight :) ) but barely even had a buzz. They basically just served us tomato juice.... Perhaps should have moved on the champagne, and if i ever was to come back id definitly stick to champagne at least then id know they were giving me alcohol.... One thing worth noting too - bottomless drink is limited to two hours and they are very strict with the two hours! Not one more second! Not a complaint but worth noting if you are going with a group and people are late!!",

    "text": "I bloody love eggs. I'm sure you can tell. I've written about them almost as much as I've warbled on about burgers - and that's ALOT!They're just so versatile and delicious and healthy. But it's not just me that thinks this - egg restaurants have been popping up all over London because chefs know they're freakin' great too. You've got Egg Break in Notting Hill, Wing Eggs in Fulham, and Stoke Newington is soon to get The Good Egg. But i like my eggs like my MJ albums and that's BADDDDD.Previously heralded as the king of the BBQ, Neil Rankin opened Bad Egg in the shadow of Ropemaker Street, Moorgate last year. Rankin built a menu of filthy egg dishes with both Korean and British influence and as of February 2015, he went one better by creating a bottomless brunch.I love brunch. Maybe more than I love eggs - but not as much as I love prosecco. And that's what they serve here, free-flowing, at the weekends. (it's actually Cava but whatevs) For \u00a332.50pp, you can chose three dishes from the menu and have your glass continuously topped up by the trendy and attentive waiters (hello v.drunk Saturday afternoons)Tom and I went last weekend as a little anniversary treat. We arrived hungry and left very drunk - but also full from the delicious dishes on offer. Breakfast tacos - wow. The mixture of the salsa, chipotle and guacamole was incredible. So much flavour and totally different to any way I've eaten eggs before.The kimchi beans on toast was one of our favourite dishes. Essentially spicy beans, with pulled pork. on toast which would be epic for a hangover. I'm surprised they didn't put a poached egg on this dish - one of the few dishes on the menu without an egg but for me the most obvious?Nduja fries with fried egg were okay but nothing to sing about. The addition of the egg for me was a bit forced - I don't think it adds anything and I'd rather of had more sauce as the spicy Nduja flavour felt lost.With the cheeseburger hash you get everything from the Bad Egg burger sans le bun. Not a highlight for me but I really enjoyed the potato hash and the sauces Rankin uses have incredible flavour.Finally the Korean rib tips, delicious fatty bites packed full of sticky ginger and gochujang flavour. We loved these but both thought they felt slightly out of place with the rest of the dishes. Probably works better on the full menu alongside other dishes with Korean influence. Bad Egg was anything but bad for me. Portion sizes are fairly small, especially if you're sharing so you won't leave stuffed but if your waiter is as liberal with the cava as ours, you will leave drunk Plus you can't really quibble with \u00a330 for food and drink of this standard.Brunch is served 10am-7pm on Saturdays and 12-5pm on Sunday - and you'll need to book.",

I'm not even sure how I found this place online, but boy am I glad I did. The difficulty in taking my closest gf's to brunch is finding things for a vegetarian who is also fructose intolerant, but Bad Egg definitely stepped up to the plate.Upon arrival we were greeted with super friendly staff, you know the kind who are a little flirty without crossing the lines, making you feel super comfortable and like you're long lost friends. All the staff here are exactly like that, and to each and every guest. We ordered Mimosa's of course, and our first course. Yep they offer you a 3 course brunch with your 2 hours of drinking, YAY. I started with french toast with chicken, banana and maple syrup. The food comes out pretty fast, and immediately you want to stuff your face with the deliciousness. My second course was poached egg on toast with avocado, and then cheeseburger hash. Everything was amazing, and just the right amount of enough of each serving.My vego-no fructose friend managed to find things to order, and the staff were really helpful in advising her what she could have. They were all about what you CAN have not, what you CAN'T have, which is what you want in a good restaurant. There was never a moment my glass didn't have something in it. EXACTLY what you want in a 2hr bottomless brunch. All in all another great place to spend an afternoon with some good friends.",

But listen to the name and don't listen to name: there is really no focus on eggs (except for in the burgers). And... Its a burger/hash/mexi fusion/greasy spoon cafe/bar/fooderie. There is not much in the way of veg unless you want potato, which less face it, doesn't really count as a vegetable. If they called it big bad burger then I wouldn't be so harsh. We had some really awkward service and it took ages for us to get everything and they were really weirded out by us ordering bits at a time and sharing. I don't think they are into the sharing thing. Or maybe we went in on a bad day. Most of their sauce were sweetened or something and I love condiments but they went overboard. If they were not sweet I would feel different. It was all very american. That being said, their hot sauce was great. Anyway, it's fatty, it's greasy and it's going to put you in a food coma.",
