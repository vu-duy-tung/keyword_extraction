We started with the scallops and kale appetizer. Both were very tasty. For entrees I had the Chicken Kiev and my husband had the lamb. Both were awesome and full of great favors. The meat is locally sourced and was so tender. Ffiona and her staff were super helpful with suggestions and very kind. This is a must try when in London.",

It was incredible, especially since my last few experiences with haddock started to make me think that haddock was a tasteless fish. Majority of their foods land from 15-20 pounds. The main waitress (who seemed to be in charge of most of the tables) was nice and when she had time, she sat down and got to know me for awhile. The other waitress was also very respectful and kind. The environment is kind of dark, but really cute with music wallpaper everywhere. Pricey dinner for a backpacker, but overall it was a very good meal. :)",

    "text": "I cannot say enough about Ffiona's & Ffiona (owner/waitress/all-around fantastic lady!). After a few subpar dining experiences on my first trip to London - Ffiona's was an absolutely amazing experience.I walked in without a reservation and instead of turning me away because she was all booked up, she eagerly figured out how to get me a table and after seating me quickly returned with bread and water - which I desperately needed after spending the whole afternoon wandering around London.Ffiona & her sidekick (who was also fantastic) were the only waitresses in the tiny establishment, but managed to keep an almost symphonic hold over the flow of the food, drinks and overall service in the restaurant.The food was incredible - I got the grilled avocado starter and then went with the classic fish & chips (which were my first fish & chips in London and actually first ever when I think about it.) Both were absolutely delicious.As amazing as the food was, it was almost an after-thought compared to the service and atmosphere that made me feel like I was at home (in the best home I could possibly imagine) even though I was thousands of miles away from my real home in NYC. That being said, I've dined in some really great establishments in New York, but Ffiona's was by far one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.Not only is the entire place just awesome in every way (I really can't say enough!), but I overheard some great stories that Ffiona was telling to other tables - including that she serves a classic American Thanksgiving and that the first sitting of which, is entirely free for anyone that wants it. THIS WOMAN IS AN ANGEL!Thank you Ffiona for being so welcoming, friendly, and giving me such a fantastic experience. You and your restaurant optimize exactly what I imagined all the best parts of London to be!",

On holiday from the US, we stopped in for dinner on our first night with no reservation - we hadn't realized ahead of time that the restaurant was so small (less than 10 tables). However, the owner managed to squeeze us in between bookings in the back room. Speaking of, the owner was quite pleasant and very passionate in describing the details of the daily specials, which were written on the large black boards adorning the walls. We settled on the asparagus and scallops for starters and the lamb and chicken kiev for mains - all of which were stunning. Highly recommend visiting Ffionas and treating yourself to a nice dinner - but book early; you may not be so lucky as to stroll in and happen upon a table.",

We try to include dinner and the occasional brunch every time we visit London, and have never been disappointed. My only concern is that the word is out beyond Kensington and this small restaurant is becoming 'popular' (in the good way). I hope it retains its friendly neighborhood feel, but I'm sure it will given the care that host Fiona gives to each and every guest. If you want to eat like the well-informed locals do, try Ffiona's and you will not be disappointed.Just returned to Ffionas in July 2016, and it is just as good as ever.

Glad we booked this place as getting a table for six would be difficult. The atmosphere was rustic and candlelit. \u00a0They brought large jugs of ice water for the table which was very nice. Drinks- a gin and tonic and a bottle of white wine were fine. Appetizers we ordered were the vegetable soup which was more of a pur\u00e9e of vegetables and the watermelon mint feta salad. We enjoyed both flavor combinations. The STAR of the night was the chicken Kiev. Unbelievable. Heart stoppingly filled with butter and herbs. Perfectly cooked and tender with a crispy outside. One of my favorite dinners of the year if not the decade. \u00a0Already planning to come back. \u00a0The rice and carrot sides went well with the melted butter that oozed from the kievs. To top our dinner off, we had two sticky toffee puddings (this sauce was well done), Eton mess, and a blueberry custard. All were fantastic but not too heavy. Again I cannot wait to return. Thank you for making my families visit more memorable.",

The menu is written only on a blackboard on the left wall, which is not admittedly the most convenient but gives the place a nice, cozy feel (there is, however, a printed drink menu).The vegetable soup came in a moderate-sized cup and was fairly thick like a puree. All the vegetables, herbs, and spices used came together beautifully.The chicken Kiev was amazing, from its perfectly crusted exterior to the moist and tender breast meat. Many a restaurant in the moderately high price range will serve up chicken that is dry and tasteless, so for them to make it not only well but extremely well is impressive. The texture was soft but not mushy, and melted in your mouth. The garlic butter filling and the sauce on the outside helped enhance the flavor of the dish.95/100",

I made a reservation with the owner a few days beforehand after seeing the yelp reviews. I was surprised that she responds directly! I would recommend making a reservation as it is a small place, very quaint and \"homey\" feeling. Ffiona greeted us and went over the menu when we arrived. We had the scallops as a starter, each had an entree: lamb, pork chop and fish cakes, and shared sides: spicy squash, mash and greens. Everything was cooked perfectly!! The meat melts in your mouth, the veggies were seasoned beautifully and we had delicious cocktails to accompany our meal. The experience is also very personal as Ffiona is very attentive. Don't make the mistake of missing out on this place!",

    "text": "I heard about this place from my friends I finally gave it a try after some shopping in Soho as we passed by this location and the queue.They don't take reservations, same as many causal restaurants in London. Be aware of some wait time to eat around London town in Zone 1 (city center) if you are just visiting and not familiar with the local food scene. The restaurant has two levels, it's not small but definitely crowded. Tables are quite close to one another, they play hit songs in the background with a causal and friendly hipster vibe. That's how I would describe it. \u00a0The menu is very simple. The One & Only main item is The iron steak. You might choose \u00a0sides and sauce. It comes with a side salad. We liked the fries, creamy spinach, and the horseradish and also peppercorn sauce to accompany the steak. Oh, and not to mention, the meal comes with a cup of warm buttery popcorn .I am also a sucker on presentation of the food. The little cleaver is a cute touch ! You can purchase it as you wish as well For the quality and the price, you really cannot go wrong here! I would say my experience matched up with the hype!",

    "text": "How do I even begin when a restaurant leaves such a beautiful & emotional impact upon you?On my last night in London, I was alone and switched to a hotel near Kensington Gardens and was starving for a place to eat. I pulled out Yelp and found Ffiona's and knew I had to try it based on the menu since I'm vegan/vegetarian. I walked in right as they opened and was warmly greeted by FFiona herself.The inside of the restaurant is the most quaint, beautiful little place I've ever stepped foot into. I wish so badly my boyfriend hadn't been working and that he could have joined me - this is definitely a great place to bring a date! However, even though I was all alone, Ffiona made me feel like I was part of the family - she herself is a warm, welcoming hostess. I ordered the Grilled avocado appetizer and was blown away. Fresh, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious. What a way to start a meal! I could eat that every single day.For my main course, I had the Courgetti and Sweet potato noodles - WOW. Raw, vegan, AND delicious? You can't beat it. I doubt any meat eater could find issue with this dish - amazing.And or course, I had to order the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert on my last night here. It was fantastic - melt in your mouth delicious.I was lucky enough to be the only patron in the restaurant the whole time I was there (I guess I can thank the warm weather, early dinner time, and the fact it was a Tuesday night). I was able to chat to Ffiona for most of my time and it really made the experience that much more beautiful. Truly, my dinner at Ffiona's was nearly life-changing - I've never been so emotionally affected by a meal before. The experience was so beautiful and so loving from start to finish - I left the restaurant feeling full and happy, though it made leaving London so much harder. Ffiona - if I could pack up you and this lovely restaurant and bring it back to New York, I would. This place is hands down my FAVORITE restaurant - US, UK, or otherwise. What a place! What a meal! I'll be telling everyone I know about this place and on my future trips to London, I'll be visiting you and bringing my friends and my appetite. Thank you for such a wonderful experience to leave London on such a high note xo",

She is filled with warmth, \u00a0kindness and she gives the best hugs.Now, the food. THE FOOD! Favorites- The chicken Kiev haunts me. It's that good.I get the same thing every time I go here, and I'm not tempted to try anything else. The chicken is so tender, filled with yummy goodness as you cut into the middle. It is a must have.The sticky toffee pudding with custard is the best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had, and I've had more than my share.I could go on and on, but I won't bore you. If you want an exceptional dining experience. Go to Ffiona's. It's that simple, just make sure to call and make a reservation!**We miss you already Ffiona! Till next time.

The restaurant is a very cozy and intimate dining area whose street front appearance belies the experience that awaits inside. While there is a printed drink menu, the food menu is written on a quaint chalkboard but be sure to ask about the daily specials! We almost missed out on the two outstanding starters - one, an incredible squid dish in a spicy \u00a0salsa-like tomato base with a garnish of fried squid on top, and, as improbable as it may sound, an incredible grilled mango with mushrooms dressed in warm balsamic vinegar. Because it is such a throwback menu item, and based on the feedback from our server, we ordered the chicken kiev and the parmesan salad. \u00a0Both were extraordinary.And when in London, you mus simply try the sticky toffee pudding which is served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and plenty of warm sauce. We were doing ou happy dance in our heads!But perhaps what may have been the icing on the cake was the opportunity to meet Ffiona, hear her story, and gain a better understanding of her craft and craftsmanship. All in all a special and memorable dining experience. Though we don't often choose to return to restaurants when we travel (because there are just so many to try!), we absolutely will go back and will recommend visitors try it as well!",

My friend enjoyed his meal a lot, his favorite vegetarian meal he had in London. Their cocktails were nice and the wine selection is also pretty good and pairs well with the meals. If wanting to come here for dinner, I recommend making a reservation before since they can get pretty full! Great place that I'd definitely come back to once I visit London again.",

The d\u00e9cor is absolutely charming and very homey - what one would expect of a cute, small, family-run European bistro. The menu was well thought-out with an appropriate amount of options. Price.... well, while everything in London is expensive to a Canadian, I still found Ffiona's too be on the expensive end for food of comparable quality in London. I had the seared lamb - a fairly small piece of meat for 24 quid, that tasted slightly above-average at best. My friend had the home-made fishcakes, which were much more impressive as the fish was fresh and tender, and the cakes were battered and fried perfectly. Fiona herself was, of course, charming, but overall compared to the excellent dining scene in London and with respect to price vs. quality, I would not return despite a pleasant experience.",

This place is a homely establishment in what is typically a rather pretentious part of town, and it's refreshing to find that these types of place still exist. I wanted the sweet potato and chorizo hash, but they had run out of it, so I got the vegan breakfast bowl instead and added two poached eggs on the side. It was rather salad-y and I had hoped it would be more quinoa and less kale. My friend had the queen scramble and was very pleased with it. The dishes seem reasonably priced, the d\u00e9cor feels like someone's home, and the person who served us (probably Ffiona herself) was very motherly and endearing. I wouldn't quite say the food lives up to the billing of \"best brunch in London,\" as they claim on the website, nor would I say it's worth traveling across London for, but it's a very comforting, low key place that is great to have in the neighbourhood.",

Her level of hospitality went beyond anything else we've experienced! Even the other patrons were warm and welcoming and we stayed much longer than we intended to while chatting with the people next to us and Ffiona. Besides being a fabulous hostess, Ffiona's food is to die for! I started with the kale salad (with quinoa, edamame, cranberries, avocado and sunflower seeds with a mango, basil and tahini dressing), which was Ffiona's recommendation. It was delicious and paired well with the cocktail she recommended. I am still talking about that amazing salad! For our main dishes, I had a chicken dish and my husband had the lamb. \u00a0Everything was so good, there was a lot of plate sharing going on! I highly recommend Ffiona's and will no doubt be back next time we're in London!",

Creamy, savory, not-too-salty sauce with hearty shreds of white chicken, soft bits of leek, and topped with delicious puff pastry went perfectly with the buttery mashed potatoes. The flavors just had that perfect home-cooked taste that you wish your mother's had ;). My friend had the fish and chips with mushy peas and found her dish amazing as well. We both were extremely full but had to save room for sticky toffee pudding and ice cream and we're so glad we did.

Ffiona's sets the bar way too high for other restaurants in the vicinity. We are here for the weekend, and arguing about whether or not we should eat here every day!",

    "text": "What an adorable & delicious spot. We walked in off the street, not realizing reservations were the norm. We should have known, considering the perfect 5-star rating on Yelp that drew us in in the first place. We were disappointed and almost turned to leave, when Fiona herself said there was a gap in reservations and if we could eat and be done in 1.5 hours, the table was ours! Easy! So we did. I ordered the fish & chips, and my wife ordered the chicken kiev. Both were such simple dishes and we didn't expect to be blown away - and yet! We both left our plates so clean the dishwasher may have wondered if they had even been used. We also had the Parmesan salad, which again, was amazingly simple but supreme. My pregnant wife also loved her elderflower mocktail. It was one of those meals where you aren't let down by even one thing - and so, Fiona's 5-star rating is obviously earned and well deserved. Fiona herself stopped by our table for a chat, and we couldn't be happier to be supporting her business. Such a lovely, genuine person. If you're in the area, make sure you make this one of your stops. We stayed in Kensington for 9 days and ate our way through the entire area. This was by far the best and most memorable meal of them all! Thanks again Fiona!",

They open at 6pm, so I called at 5:30, said I was one, and it was no problem. I was the first person in the door and was welcomed and seated and we got started right away. Fiona explained the menu with gusto and a no-nonsense confidence. I started with the fig and goat cheese salad. Light, tasty, beautifully dressed. Next I opted for the famous Chicken Kiev, which was perfectlyexecuted. The chicken was fried perfectly, juicy on the inside, with a beautiful garlic butter sauce oozing out from the inside. Did have room for dessert.Don't miss it if you are in the area. Make sure you book, this place is hot!",

    "text": "Ffiona's is simply one of those restaurants that makes you question all of your previous five star ratings. I had the pleasure of visiting this charming little British restaurant last week for a team dinner with a handful of coworkers and I think most of us agreed it was one of our best meals in London. The lights were low, the walls covered in sheet music and not a menu in sight--other than what was scribbled on the back wall in chalk. \u00a0I ordered the Rump of Welsh Lamb and it was without a doubt the best lamb I've ever. It was impossibly tender and there was a thick salty crust that made it perfect just on it's own. However, for those that aren't purists, there were two sauces served with the lamb, a sweet chutney and a mint sauce that surprisingly took the dish to a whole new level. The drinks were not anything special for me, but still well executed. For dessert, I finally got my long-awaited sticky toffee pudding! Toffee is one of my favorite sweets and this one was everything I hoped for and more. Richer and stickier than what I've experienced in the U.S., this toffee sauce clung tightly to the moist sponge cake beneath it. It was topped with vanilla ice cream which was a nice subtle sweetness to cut the intense toffee flavor. \u00a0The service was excellent all around. Our waitress (Fiona herself!) even comped one of our bottles of wine as a apology for having to sit next to an extra rowdy (read: drunk) group for the entire night. If you're in Kensington, or elsewhere in London and up for a commute, this is a must try!",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a special place to eat for our last evening in London. After a number of Yelp reviews and online searches, we narrowed the list of places down to just two. We were staying at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, and wanted something within walking distance. After getting lost, we hailed a Black Cab and said \"please take us to Ffiona's on Church Street. We're starving!\"Ffiona's is one of those little gems that you read about, but rarely have the privilege of actually coming across. The restaurant is small, cozy, and welcoming. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly waitress who showed us to one end of two of their community style dining tables. There are other tables that seat smaller parties but they were full.After ordering our meal, my wife quickly identified the owner, a friendly, affable, take-charge woman who was frequently chatting with a number of the other guests, many of whom appeared to be neighborhood regulars.The meal itself was excellent. I had the Scottish Sirloin Steak with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and roasted carrots. Exactly the type of no-nonsense meal that I was looking for. My wife ordered the Scallops and thoroughly enjoyed them.During our meal, Ffiona came by our table to check on us, which gave my wife, who also owns a restaurant in Los Angeles, an opportunity to strike up a conversation. They ended up chatting for 20 minutes about the restaurant business. We feel like we've made a new friend.All in all, we had a fantastic experience. The atmosphere was cozy, the owner and staff were friendly and attentive, the prices were very reasonable, and the value was over the top. Our favorite meal of our entire trip.We will definitely be back on our next trip to the UK!",

    "text": "If you know Kensington, you know Ffiona's, and there's a good reason for that. Right up front here I need to give Ffiona's recognition for embracing Yelp and adding functionality like being able to contact and quickly hear back from Ffiona's wholly within the app - brilliant. I know Yelp can be extremely frustrating for many business owners, but Ffiona, who is a true gem of a human and big part of why Ffiona's is so appealing, has really embraced the interface in a positive way. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?What more could you ask for? Quaint and authentic, a meal at Ffiona's honestly feels as though you're a guest at here house, with standard dining room table, chair, and cutlery options akin to what are likely in your own home in addition to a simple menu and specials that will cover all the favorites. It's worth noting here that Ffiona herself is lovely in every way, and truly cares for each of her customers as if they were, again, a guest in her own home. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Ffiona's isn't what I would call cheap, but by Kensington standards she's right in line with the average price points more or less across the board. If I recall correctly my jalapeno scramble special was \u00a315.00 or so with my side of sausage included, and while it wasn't a ton of food as you might be able to deduce from the picture, it was satisfying. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Breakfast dishes are my favorite dishes, and Ffiona's dished up a good one. While a little bit runny as you also might be able to tell from the picture, my jalapeno scramble with mushrooms, some potatoes, and diced pickled jalapenos had really good flavor and went well atop the toast. I was hoping for a tad bit more than a single piece of sausage as my side, but that too was very good. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Next time my mother is in London I'm bringing her to Ffiona's first thing, and come to think of it there's no one I wouldn't bring to Ffiona's given the charm, the atmosphere, the menu, value, and quality. Star Granted.",

It is also not good for groups. \u00a0Anything more than a party of 6 might have an issue getting a table.The food? \u00a0The menu says \"Probably the best Chicken KIev in the world\" and it is right. \u00a0If there is a better serving of this dish, I haven't had it. \u00a0Perfectly cooked chicken served in a sauce that deserves to be sopped up with bread. \u00a0Note that none of the entrees came with sides, so we recommend the chips (aka fries) and the spicy butternut squash. \u00a0My step-sons had the scottish sirloin steak and the swordfish. \u00a0My daughter had the homemade vegetable soup and avocado and pesto salad. \u00a0The desserts did not disappoint either: sticky toffee pudding, apple crumble and something I think called an Eaton - it was a meringue with strawberries.The are quite a few mixed cocktails - and mocktails for the alcohol-adverse.One of the highlights of the meal was the interaction with the owner and restaurant namesake: Ffiona. \u00a0FFiona splits time between the kitchen and the dining room. \u00a0She truly cares for each meal and diner.I can see why there are currently 175 Yelp reviews with a neat perfect rating.",

Portions were generous - couldn't finish it all. Had to try the lemon mascarpone cheesecake for dessert, which didn't disappoint. Cozy bistro location, good for couples, business and saw a few families. Will definitely make a point of returning next time I'm in London.",

I showed up alone, without a reservation but Fiona (is her name really spelled with two ffs? I forgot to ask) graciously found me a seat at a large (communal?) table. the space is pretty small, but the tables are spaced out pretty well so it's intimate but you don't feel like you're sharing your meal with people at the next table. I think there is the one large table which is probably used for walk-ins.the menu is written on a big chalkboard. I think there are some daily specials as well as the standard fare. I opted for the grilled avocado which was fantastic. I doubt I would go back and not order it every time. for main they had duck breast that night which was superb.wine list was not extensive, but enough options, and fairly priced.but the best part of the experience is the atmosphere. it's so cozy and inviting and on the night I was there, Fiona was chatting with the customers in a way that made everyone feel like they were friends. she came to my table and talked with me for a while too, which was really nice.I come to London quite frequently these days and Ffiona's will definitely be on my regular rrotation :)",

After a long day of pounding pavement, the last thing I wanted to do on a Friday night was to fight for a table at a loud pub. Ffiona's was a delightful gem in the middle of a bustling city. Ffiona actually greeted us when we walked through the door. The ambiance was beautiful with candlelight, chalkboard menus and sheet music wallpaper. I had the fish and chips, my first London meal. And, my mom had the peppercorn steak. We shared sides of spicy butternut squash and steamed greens. Everything was fulfilling and delicious. My favorite food parts of this place were the mushy peas and the greens. What comfort food! Although the food was fantastic, my overall favorite part of this trip was Ffiona. She sat with patrons as they ate as if she'd know them for years when in fact they only stopped in moments before. Some she actually has known for years. You couldn't tell the difference. For all I knew, I was at Ffiona's house as her friend. Her food was delicious, her personality was more than satisfying. I will return to Ffiona's again and again.",

Walked in after a California cigarette to a homey but artsy vibe, old school eating, grandma housevive or your more nerdy conservative friend (book club hot mom vibe). The waitress was funny (later to find out it's Ffiona the owna) knew the dishes well, cussed as she spoke and really read the room and environment. \u00a0She loves her job and obviously loves to host and entertain. \u00a0It was a well needed escape. \u00a0All ingredients are as fresh as possible, healthy and organic. \u00a0The grilled avocado did change my life, I feel enlightened and glowing as if tonight will be an epic adventure due to the perfection in the flavor. \u00a0My colleagues all were in owe of there dishes. \u00a0We couldn't go wrong. \u00a0I ordered the fish specialty which was a fresh trout with a coconut lime sauce. \u00a0And she was nice enough to take off the skin (I think it's a texture thing). \u00a0If you are a touring band, in London area or a foodie. \u00a0It's worth it. \u00a0Love you Ffiona, next time dinners on me.",

The entire experience was outstanding from start to finish. Ffiona herself welcomes you, tells you about the specials, and with the aid of her right hand, Tilly, serves you. I started with a salad of greens and fried Halloumi cheese. The cheese was so good that I shared it with my colleagues. For my entree I had the Chicken Kiev, which the menu -- on a chalkboard -- claims is the best in the world. I believe them. The chicken was done to perfection and the garlic, butter, and (some green veggie) stuffed in the middle were excellent. Dessert was sticky toffee pudding. I cleaned the plate. We also had a nice bottle of wine -- Barbera d'Alba Sucule 2006, Villa Lanata, Italy.The ambience was warm and inviting, and the location, a short walk from the Kensington Tube, was very convenient. The entire restaurant had a happy and friendly vibe. If you're on that side of London -- or even if you're not -- seek out Ffiona's. (I had a nice conversation with a large family, also from the U.S., who seemed to be enjoying the restaurant as much as I did.)",

It was early morning and I glanced in a window to see five empty wine bottles, and a scattering of glasses on the table, it surprised me because it looked more like a lovely after-scene of a great party, casual and beautiful and ... welcoming. i thought.. oh, i must try that! The first time I ate at ffionas..several months later.. I found the impression I had that first morning was spot on. My date and I were warmly welcomed by Ffiona herself, regaled with tales of the mysterious goings on in the kitchen and firmly guided to menu choices that fulfilled our every secret desire. The steak was exceptional, perfectly cooked medium rare, the sauce Diane a revelation, served with a lovely soup of carrot corriander and pumpkin, a sexy tangy salad and sides of mash and asparagus spears with garlic so sumptuous it made me lightheaded. I live in Peru now ( the home of some amazing food as well!!) . but when I get a new volunteer in our house from London, as I often do, if they know Ffiona's? We are bosom pals.",

We were staying in Kensington near the palace so I wanted to find a restaurant close to our hotel for our first night in after travel. As you can obviously see, Ffiona's has great reviews. The location is a little bit off the main drag, but not too far. When we first got there, we were pretty surprised at the simple storefront and very small interior. Don't be fooled!Ffiona herself was there running the show as she has been for 20+ years. All of the menu items are written up on the chalk board. It's an extremely homey experience. We got a great bottle of red wine and just let Ffiona basically pick what we should order. My entire family loved their dishes. We had fish and chips, lamb, fish, everything. Overall very intimate experience. It's evident that Ffiona has been doing this for a long time and cares very much about each and every visitor having an amazing time.",

Word to the wise: listen to what is being offered, she means what she's saying if something is good or recommended. And, we're the travelers in her house so take it easy, enjoy some wine and order some delicious food, everything else will fall into place. We had so much fun we made a new friend for life. I'm so thrilled we decided to come in despite the few scary reviews. We ordered: half bottle of white wine, fizzy water, scallops for appetizer, chicken Kiev, an assortment of sides, the special seafood stew, and last but not least, sticky toffee pudding.

Naively we headed to Ffiona's on a Saturday night without a reservation and a group on 7!The placed was packed when we arrived at 7:30. \u00a0After walking 1.75 miles to get there I was suddenly filled with fear upon arrival that the rest of my party would be upset, to put it lightly, if we couldn't get in. We patiently waited 10 minutes at the door and then were asked if we had a reservation. No I respond with trepidation, um Ffiona says, I'm not sure we can get you in. A few minutes later a large group gets up and miraculously we are seated!If you want to dine here, be smarter than me and make a reservation.We were seated next to a regular who was kind enough to provide us with some recommendations.We ordered the beef and liver pie, so tasty. \u00a0The top is puff pastry the liver was perfectly cooked. Not grainy.The Hake(fish) was the best item on the menu!The fish and chips were well executed with a moist interior and a crispy exterior.The pork chop was the second best item! It was so moist and well seasoned.Mussels were good, everything was great. Do yourself a favor and come here.",

We waited close to the door, but some other customers came in and there we're still gaps in the door, she was mad about that and shouted at me and my friends to close my door. Is this my responsibility to help you close the door if it's caused by others lady? If you want your customers to close the door. Why don't you be polite and I will feel more comfortable.

We arrived at 6pm without a reservation and even though they were fully booked, she was able to squeeze us in.

It was a very cozy, hospitable atmosphere - although the benches by the window weren't exactly the most comfortable. He had ordered the pork chop which was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and not dry like most pork chops with a side of the best mashed potatoes he claims he has ever had. I had ordered what I thought was the special with hake but received a dish with veggie noodles which was amazing by itself (warm zucchini noodles w/ carrots, multigrains and nuts). I had asked where my hake was and I guess there was a misunderstanding when I had ordered. Fiona had rectified the problem right away - my hake came quickly after. For dessert, we had to try the sticky toffee pudding which was a tad too sweet for us but my teeth were still intact after finishing the whole thing! I was actually not feeling too well from walking around in the cold rain, but the food here LITERALLY WARMED MY SOUL. It was the first time I felt warm ever since arriving. Service was excellent. Times are posted on the door - we were sad we wouldn't be able to make it back for another meal. We will visit this place the next time we are in London for sure!",

We had the most delightful meal at Ffiona's on one of our first nights back from Paris to Kensington. The chicken Kiev was off the charts amazing. The service was as great as the meal. We had our 3 year old daughter with us, who is (apologies for gloating) an excellent traveler and amateur restauranteur , and the staff could not have been anymore accommodating to her dairy/soy allergies as well as just being very nice by talking to the kiddo and kept her entertained. We had such a pleasant experience that we made reservations for brunch on our last morning in London, but when we got there, there was some sort of problem with the gas lines for the kitchen. Fiona came right out, remembered us right away (we were only there the night before or so) and was sincerely apologetic. Not only was she so apologetic, but she sent us to another restaurant nearby that had an excellent breakfast (Fiona said it was where she gets breakfast when she's not working, which is apparently never). I need to head back to London soon, because if the brunch is half as good as the chicken Kiev, I'd consider moving out of New York!!!",

I highly recommend the pesto eggs Benedict as the pesto was delicious and the combination of flavors was really nice. We went on a Friday at 11am and were the only ones there which made for a nice private brunch. I imagine it gets really busy on the weekends. The owner was there and both her and the server were really nice. Quick tip for U.S. visitors, bacon in the UK is more similar to salted ham. It is still pork and delicious, just prepared differently.",

    "text": "How lucky were we that someone told us that we must go to the Churchill Arms for a pint or tow and how lucky were we that Ffiona's was just down the street. After doing a quick Yelp search, checked the reviews and menu and were out the door to have dinner at this quaint 5 star. \u00a0It was early for dinner by NY standards, we were that at about 6:30pm, the restaurant is small, but super cozy. We're asked if we have a reservation and are told they are fulling booked the entire evening. As we sadly go to leave, we are stopped by Ffiona herself as she asks if she could \"squeeze\" us into the corner of a large sharing table. We all noticed how nicely the table was divided by several vases of flowers and flickering candles. And we had a window seat which was just lovely to see the local scene is this cute Kensington 'hood.Ok, lucky us! We got a great seat and we're hungry and ready to eat. Ffiona told us about the specials and told us the menu was written on the wall, I hopped up to check out the offerings. We decided on a warm avocado salad, the avocado was smooth and creamy and perfectly ripe, it was somehow warmed on the skin and then plated with some micro green and delicious pesto dressing. Ffiona told me of the fish pie, I've never heard of this British fave, and wasn't sure about ordering it, so glad that I did....It was so good, hot and creamy and filled chunks of salmon and cod in a tasty while sauce and topped with mashed potatoes that we're lightly browned. It was a bowl of pure heaven. Friends had the fish and chips and the chicken Kiev, all got rave reviews! Ffiona pops by often to see how we like everything and then comes by to tell us about her homemade deserts. She offers a blueberry and apple crisp that is served with ice cream and a bread and butter pudding that just came out of the oven. I think she mentioned one or another, but we glazed over and ordered both of those and were so happy we did! Perfect end to a perfect meal. Ffiona comes by one more time and sits down with us. Asks where we are from and tells a story of coming for a visit to NY when she was just a child. We don't want to share her with the other tables, but she needs to tend to all. She asks what we had and scribbles down a check for us. Such an awesome time and fantastic hospitality Ffiona! I only wish you were around the corner in my 'hood here!",

The food is truly sensational, incredibly creative and fresh, and the staff, including the brilliant owner, are as nice as they come. It's really like having a gourmet meal in a good friends home. You are made to feel so welcomed and then you are lavished with a wonderful meal. Considering how good the food is, the prices are very reasonable. Favorites include the Sunday roasts, the to-die-for Chicken Kiev, the Steak and Kidney Pie, and any lamb dish the wizard chief decides to make. Desserts that send me to the moon include the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had, and the fresh fruit cobblers with a creamy vanilla custard. Amazing dining. I want to wrap my arms around Ffiona's and take it home with me.",

    "text": "Ffiona's Restaurant is a true hidden gem of London. Run by Ffiona herself, this spot serves up incredible, British inspired dishes with gourmet spins in a cozy, casual yet slightly elegant environment. When we arrived at Ffiona's, we were warmly greeted by Ffiona, though we were told dinner was full. Luckily, there seemed to be a no-show for a reservation so she told us if we just waited 5 minutes and the reservers didn't show then we could have their table. As luck would have it, 5 minutes passed and Ffiona had us seated, telling us she was happy to serve us! Bare in mind, this is a small establishment with limited seating within limited hours, so you may want to make a reservation; not all could be so lucky! We had wine and were served delicious warm bread and butter as we looked over the fantastic menu. Ffiona has many British classics on the menu and all sound delicious. We began with bowls of the Homemade Vegetable Soup; so comforting after being outside in the cold rain. A pea centric dish, it was simply delightful; light but rich! So many mains to choose from, but there was a special on we just could not pass up: Traditional Roast Beef with Housemade Horseradish, Yorkshire Pudding, Potatoes, Braised Cabbage, and Glazed Carrots. Truly and honestly, this meal was DIVINE! I don't normally eat a lot of beefy meals, but it just seemed right being in England in the chilly Autumn. The beef was tender and rich in that way only beef can be. The beef soaked up its own au jus sauce around it and it's richness was cut perfectly by the Housemade Horseradish, which was sharp but much smoother and less hot than the jarred version. The Yorkshire Pudding was fluffy and savory, a perfect vehicle to soak up more of that au jus. The potatoes were so beautifully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. And the cabbage and carrots were earthly and sweet respectively; both balancing out the heartiness of the other elements of the entire dish. Truly a fantastic dinner! Also, I must note that Ffiona takes great pride in her food. This was a special of the day because she said she found some great beef earlier and bought it for the dinner hours. She is actively seeking out quality ingredients to make her meals. We were some of the last to get the roast beef as I heard her tell the server working with her that \"there's no more beef\"; this means that her team is working with quality ingredients that are fresh, and not over produced. It's refreshing! I have a lot of respect for this. We finished out the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding a.k.a. my new favorite dessert! A soft pound cake covered in a sticky toffee sauce reminiscent of caramel but with that more distinctive toffee flavor. I've never had sticky toffee pudding but always wanted to try it; I'm sure glad I did! Another great perk of dining at Ffiona's is Ffiona herself! She is out on the floor, taking orders, serving food, and causing laughter in her wake. She is jovial and full of life; she even sat down with guests to joke with them as she took orders and even danced while carrying plates of beautiful food to the excited guests. I could sit and talk to her all night!A close atmosphere, I also met another solo American traveler who I had come and sit with us to enjoy the lovely meal and awesome experience. This was a truly wonderful dining experience I will always remember as part of my time in London. The atmosphere, the new friend, the laughs and jokes with Ffiona, and the awe inspiring food. If you're in London for dinner, come here!",

Will definitely have to come back for lunch or dinner on my next trip.Was a quick bus ride from our hotel and easy to find on a cute block off the beaten path of Kensington High Street.

I say this because we never actually made it to ordering a meal before we left and went to another restaurant. We went this past Sunday (10JUN2018). After a 5 minute wait we were seated and handed menus. Along with the menus (which only had breakfast items and a few other options) there was a large chalkboard portion of the wall which had meal items as well. My wife does not like eggs so we were a bit worried that they were only serving their brunch menu at the time. We tried to flag the waitress 3 TIMES to no avail. She literally would not even look our way...the closest we got was her walking past us and in passing saying \"i'll be right with you\". After about 15 minutes of waiting she finally comes over and says \"are you ready to order\". We ask about the menu and are informed, at this point finally, that it was only the brunch menu. Had she taken 2 seconds to stop and answer a simple question we could have easily been on our way to another local spot. I know that during brunch places can get busy and hectic but it wasn't that busy at the time and she could have easily answered a really easy quick question.",

Ffiona's attitude is nothing short of insulting to the point it made us wonder if she had some sort of bigotted bias against Americans (?), Jews (?), people with children (!!!). The place has a note on the door stating it is child friendly. It is not. There are no high chairs. There is little tolerance for childish misbehavior. The owner and her employee were impolite to us. We were not offered deserts at the end of our meal to make sure we rush out to allow others to be seated. We were not presented the full range of options when we were seated (we know, because others in the restaurant received better care).",

Months before our trip, our friend Lori S. had recommended we stop in at Ffiona's if we'd be in Kensington during our visit. On our last day, we found ourselves randomly just a few blocks away from the restaurant, so we called and got a table for dinner.We were so warmly greeted by Ffiona that I would have swore we were in the Southern US, not London. Ffiona is the brightest ray of sunshine that she could clear the sky on even the gloomiest of London days. She set us up at a table in the back and we all got settled in. We quickly glanced over the menu, with our party of four (me, the Mister, and his parents) deciding fairly quickly which delicious sounding items we'd have for dinner. For me, as soon as I saw fish and chips, I knew it had to be my final dinner of our trip. I found it to be just delicious and the perfect selection. The fish was nice, flaky, and the batter was wonderfully crisp. The chips were also great, along with the mushy peas! Just simply perfect, especially along with the bottled cider on the menu. I was one happy American tourist.For dessert, we had a wide selection of offerings, from sticky toffee pudding to just simple ice cream. We all chose something different and shared... leaving happy and satisfied.The best part was when Ffiona came over to check how everything was. We explained that we were on the last day of our visit and came to Ffiona's on Lori S.'s recommendation. She immediately remembered Lori from 3 years earlier and even knew what table she sat at. She was such a gem and let us record a little video with her to send to Lori in the states.Look, I am just going to put it out there. If I could have stuffed Ffiona into my luggage, she'd currently be living in Columbus, Ohio. She was such a delight and we felt such an immediate connection with her that it is heartbreaking that we live on the other side of the Atlantic. I don't know when I'll be back in London; but when I am, I'll be at Ffiona's!",

We had the avocado appetizer which turned me instantly into an avocado lover with its buttery taste and cooling greens. It was perfect blend of crisp and sweet And savory! We also had the asparagus which was pretty yummy as well I had the beef strips, not sure what it's called. It was delicious and I enjoyed it slowly. The pizzer \u00a0drink (spelled it wrong I think ) Was amazing though it looked weird with several leaves and fruits inside. We ended our meal with coffee with baileys!It's extreme coffee that's for sure.",
