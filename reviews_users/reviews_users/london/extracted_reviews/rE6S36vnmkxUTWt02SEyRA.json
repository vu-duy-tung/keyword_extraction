The prices are extremely reasonable especially considering the quality of food. The menu has a great range of Nigiri and Maki rolls which taste so fresh that you feel the chef has caught the fish himself. It's open every day until 10pm so it's a great place to order when I get home late from work and can't be bothered to cook.",

The emphasis is clearly value for money; they cost the same as a chain outlet but deliver far superior quality and fresher sushi. I have 'used' YouMeSushi a number of times when passing by late at night, eat-in, take-out, and have found the quality of sushi and other dishes to be consistently good. I often look forward to stopping-by. Park anywhere near Marylebone Station if you are in the car. When you call them, your account is automatically open on their screen so no need to repeat names, numbers, or delivery addresses over the phone. Smart, efficient. Like. You can eat in, however be prepared for quite a bustling atmosphere, people leaning over your table to order, chaps with helmets taking their deliveries in and out.Update - I no longer live in W12, I live in W4. Sadly they don't deliver to either!",

It's fastfood \"Japanese\". When walking into the storefront there is the display of food to your right. That's super clean and nicely laid out. The first time I went I bought the Beef noodle soup and a salmon salad type sushi plate. The only good thing is when you buy any Sushi/sashimi box you get a free miso soup. I ordered my whole meal for take out (or in the UK take away). I spent I think around 14-15. To me...it was NOT worth it. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. The second time I went was about a week or two ago. I bought the duck noodle soup for 6 pounds. That was nothing memorable. Result: I'll come here only as a last resort. I'd rather go to the other places nearby for basically the same price. Sorry you me sushi you are definitely NOT for me.",

Ahem, I mean, she invited me over to share her dinner with her.They give 10% discounts to students, no wonder my friend loves this place (yes we are both well over the age of university but she is doing her PHD or something). But not only that, the sushi/sashimi quality is pretty good. I have absolutely no complaints there. I have not had mayonnaise in their sushi either (hurray! Not westernised sushi!) so I am one happy bunny and will not refuse food from here. The price seems decent albeit at the high end considering you are doing takeaways. Oh well, as long as it tastes good!",

I wish I discovered this earlier. With so many new Wasabi chains opening up, it'd be so much better if they were You Me Sushi's instead.The rice bowls are made to order, so the chicken katsu stays nice and crispy, and everything just tastes fresher, unlike Wasabi. There also is no additional charge for soy sauce or wasabi.I even love the fact that You Me Sushi has more choices than Wasabi. I don't eat salmon or prawn, so I'm left with just veggie rolls at the other place. Here, I can get their specialty rolls that have no salmon or prawn in them.Affordable price, great staff, and great food. Even though this place isn't close to me, I'm definitely coming back.",

    "text": "I'm not a sushi fan, but strangely, I sometimes crave it. On one such occasion, a few nights ago, we decided to order some online form the You Me Sushi website. After some complications them receiving/confirming our order, we were delivered a colourful and well presented box of nigiri, maki and sashimi. As per usual, I ate a little and wondered why I'd craved sushi and opted instead for cooking a lentil curry and chapatis instead. My partner however, who loves sushi was enthusiastic about the taste and freshness of the food and had no problem eating everything in the box. So apparently it was pretty good!",

His reaction to the everyday situations was interesting. Anyway, I ate some sushi too. I think that if you want to taste some delicious sushi rolls this restaurant is the right choice that you should make.",

As i ate it in the office one colleague also commented afterwards that the sushi didnt smell 100% fresh - something i didnt pick up on while eating. No matter how good the prices - i just dont think that i'll take a chance on eating the food from there again. With sushi, taking that sort of chance just isnt worth it.",
