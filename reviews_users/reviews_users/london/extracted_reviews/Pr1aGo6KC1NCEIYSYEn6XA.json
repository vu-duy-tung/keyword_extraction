If I say one of the best coffee I've had in London, It would be unfair if you consider I'm Italian, and I know how a proper espresso has to be made!Seriously speaking this small, perfectly tidy coffee shop makes amazing coffee. Caffe' Vergnano pretty famous in Italy, 1882 is the year they have been estabilished (in Italy of course) the coffee roasting activity, yes, because they make their oun blend, and they sell it as well if you want to have the same coffee flavour at home which you can't, I think, because you don't have the right machine! Anyway, the only spot, as it often happens, was the bar lady, who looked pissed off, wasn't smiling at all, didn't greet us nor when we went in, neither when we left (of couse saying \"thank you bye bye\"). This kind of habit is very disappointing, specially in a small place like this one (the entire bar can't be more than 30 mq, with 5 tables in total). What a shame!",

    "text": "[This is part of a larger review of London coffee houses which can be found here: wp.me/pwXBH-or ] Set along the shop-fronts on an unlikely stretch of Charing Cross Road (unlikely in the sense that you don't expect a serious coffee house here amongst the touristy drek), it is none other than Caff\u00e8 Vergnano 1882. I have been in a number of times now and haven't exactly gotten to the bottom of what the 1882 stands for (okay, I haven't really tried to find out), but that is beside the point. The small chain has been set up by Luciano Franchi, whose family has been working for three generations in the London food industry. They apparently supply coffee and related machinery to the Italian Embassy, for whatever that's worth. But the best thing about walking into Caff\u00e8 Vergnano is seeing their gargantuan silver madame, the holy grail of espresso fabrication, the elegant and maniacal stainless steel workhorse that pumps dark brown blood through its veins, the aortic arch from which the pulse of Verganano's espresso emanates. Yeah, it's the big honkin' shiny espresso machine that you can't miss from window. It is the Elektra Belle Epoque, and on its crown is perched a peering eagle. To make a long story short, it makes a mean cup of espresso. Their own blend of espresso is composed of seven single-origin beans (including the elusive and expensive Nicaraguan Maragogype) and it is one of the nicer ones I've had, certainly one of the top in London. It has a full and broad flavor spectrum and, to me, has a tad more bitterness beneath it than Monmouth's, though without being cloying. My favorite incarnation of Vergnano's espresso is a double macchiato, with the little bit of foam providing a tiny cushion of creaminess to offset the fine espresso flavor. The other thing I like about Vergnano is that it is sort of like an Italian espresso bar. You can order your drink and have it standing up at the counter \u00a0or if you want you can sit down or walk out with it. With each coffee they also give you a little Italian biscuit or chocolate (I have never figured out if it's the drink you order or the luck of the draw that determines which one you get), and I think it's a great little touch. I would probably describe the service at the Charing Cross Road branch as 'professional'. It's not warm, it's not touchy, it's not personal, but it's not rude or mean either. They are just there doing their job and trying to provide you with a good drink. The gist of it: I haven't been to their other branches, but I think that this one is great. No-nonsense accomplished espresso drinks and the holy grail of coffee machines staring you in the face. Plus you get a little treat with your coffee and can stand at the bar.",

Thankfully there's Caffe Vergnano located just a few blocks away on Charring Cross road. While it doesn't have the cosy, bohemian atmosphere that Monmouth has, its clean small tables still provide a cosy enough atmosphere. Most visually striking is their unusual espresso Elektra-branded espresso machine, with three small platforms constantly filled with that wonderful dark liquid with an impressive eagle figure mounted on top. Most importantly, the coffee is great - I've never had that burnt, bitter taste many other places create and it's one of those places where they serve espresso as they would in Italy, at the bar if you prefer complete with a small shot of water and a small amaretto biscuit to finish it all off. Unfortunately they don't know (yet) how to make a flat white coffee to go.",

It's \u00a31.70 for a single espresso, \u00a31.90 for a latte. They have iced coffees, sandwiches, and pastries. There were two separate groups of Italians in here having coffee when I stopped in.

The damn espresso machine isn't as big as your fridge for nothing. DO try it. The exterior is most unimpressive and the pastries aren't much to write home about (though I must say the cannoli is looks at me flirtatiously) but the coffee, ah, the coffee. The actual object of my affections (person, not beverage) claims he has not had a better espresso shot - it was balanced, sublime, not too much of anything (not too mild, not too bitter, not too etc. etc.) but just as it should be in its lovely honey color and presented not merely in a tiny cup but a platter accompanied with water shot to get your excitement going. I am fond of the cappuccino, which has an excellent foam consistency, no bubbles at all. I have been to their branch at the Southwark center as well for dinner, and apart from the coffee the actual food and dessert menu makes \"the stuff i have to do to get to the coffee\" more a pleasure than a chore.

We had a cappuccino and an espresso with whipped cream. Both were serveded in front of us but still somewhat lukewarm. The whipped cream was out of a ready made cheap tin supply which I would not expect from a place that says that exists since 1882. And the amount was bearly visible, floating already with big oily marks disolving as no substance to it. When I pointed out that it is a bit poor (it was requested literary as it was given) I was said to pay an extra 30 Pence for a top up.... so my conclusion:IF YOU WISH TO HAVE A GOOD COFFEE WITH REAL SERVICE AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!",

    "text": "A dependably spectacular espresso or macchiato. I always make an effort to stop in here when I'm around Charing Cross. It's a tiny space, really more of a coffee bar than a cafe. That means it can be crowded and not much of a place to linger (esp. as it lacks a toilet). But the espresso is consistently outstanding and probably the best Italian style esspresso I've had here in London. I would recommend having your coffee here, as opposed to taking it away because it is served beautifully, and I swear the thick black and white ceramic cups themselves lend something of the texture and flavour to the espresso. It's meant to be drank quickly anyway. Even with the limited space, being Italian, and on the edge of Covent Garden, it has a touch of the theatrical. I remember the first time I stopped in, everything was presented in the ritualistic Italian style, small glass of mineral water to clear the palate and a chocolate on the side to finish off. The espresso is prepared using a dramatic copper and brass Elektra with a gleaming eagle at its top. When I tasted my double macchiato it was the perfect symphony of initial fruity sweetness, blending to earthy and chocolate tones finally ending with a perfectly rounded warm nutty finish. It was like an aria for my palate. I don't know if their milk-based drinks do as much justice to the flavours of their signature blend of beans. For anyone who wishes to experience espresso the way it tastes in Italy, I can't recommend anyplace in the UK more highly than this.",

Almost as good as Italian. It's made in a small skyscraper perched on the counter which looms over the tiny cafe. But the coffee shows it's not just a decoration. Can also recommend some of their chocolate torta too. Very moreish. The only drawback is the lack of room - it's too small but the branch on the South Bank has more room and the coffee is as good. Plus there is a restaurant downstairs! The name puzzles me. Everywhere it says 1882 and I recommend it to people as 1882. Yet officially it's Caffe Vergnano. Odd.",

They use real chocolate sauce and the coffee is rich but not dominating.The accompanying toasted Panini was very average, so I guess it's the coffee that's the winner. It's a small shop - not easy to procure a table but cosy if you do. The staff range from sometimes friendly, sometimes not. Artwork on the walls are clippings on why they make the best coffee and reviews. Never a lack of reading material. They have recently opened a shop with accompanying restaurant at the South Bank.

The panini remind me of what I found in Padua and Verona. I've sat here for hours, watching the world go by, on a single cup of coffee, and never felt hassled to move.

Look in the window of this small coffee shop on Charing Cross road and you will be greeted with a view of the Rolls Royce of coffee machines positioned on the counter in all its gleaming, silver beauty. Take a step through the door and the wonderful, strong aroma of fresh coffee gently hits your nostrils, and if the (limited) seats are full, you can order take-out. It's not the sort of place conducive to a long read of the papers or a lazy stay curled up with a coffee and a book, but for a quick warm-up or caffeine hit on your own or with a friend it's just perfect. Of course, they do all the coffees you'd expect and there's also a small selection of delicious pastries and nibbles to munch on too. Part of a small chain with another branch on the Southbank, think of it as the more stylish and chic little sister of Cafe Nero.",

After being absolutely bowled over by just everything in the newly opened Chancery Lane/New Street Square branch (so good I went back twice) I ventured into this little coffee shop. Same incredible double espresso from the gleaming silver machine but without the friendly staff, the ambience, the warmth all round. They also did get our order wrong even after confirming that they could do a skinny number for the hubcap. Have to agree with the italian dude below that this world class product is being let down by the staff. Don't get me wrong, they weren't rude to anyone, just humourless and just forget about expecting a smile or a hello, goodbye. The staff access area's also alongside a table for two and I felt sorry for the couple that were seated there as they weren't able to relax with all the comings and goings. I'd ditch this table during staff change-over periods. Pity - still there's the branch nearer me to frequent (only open weekdays) and their other on the South Bank for my weekend coffee fix to try out. If the staff are grotty there I will be hunting down Mr Franchi to let him know about his problemo.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a decent independent coffee shop in the heart of central London then look no further. The Shop As a Whole:First things first is the location of the coffee shop. Situated on Charing Cross Road and only a moments walk away from Leicester Square tube station and slightly but still accessibly close to Tottenham Court Road tube station this coffee shop could not be located anywhere better. Ideal if you want to have a sit down and a coffee after wandering around town as well as ideal if coffee is your first thought before the real shopping begins. The shop in general is tiny. Has around about 3 to 4 small square tables that sit 2 people at a time and a tiny cushion area around the back where it can sit 4 to 5 people max, so, you're always taking a chance when visiting. Although the shop is tiny, the customer count is not the same which shows it's popularity, but like I mentioned, that all reduces your chances of a seat. In general there is a calm atmosphere, few photos or inscriptions dotted around but no real ooomph to the design and ambience, however, they do make it up with their coffee as well as customer service. Coffee and Customer service:I must say that I've been here only twice, but, when I was thinking about a coffee shop in town that was not a chain I thought of this one. Why? Because of the customer service as well as the coffee (more points to the coffee though)Customer service is a vital aspect in small niche venues as well as large scale ones due to the fact that it keeps visitors coming back and personally although this shop is not gleeming with it, it still has the friendly, smiley and engaging barista... What more could one ask for? The coffee on the other hand speaks quality. Best tip when trying a new coffee shop is to not add any sugar or sweetness to the coffee (unless included) as you'll get the full effect and I must say that this coffee shop has great quality coffee. Carefully made with their state of the art machines and well trained batistas you'll recieve your cappuccino with the signature love heart design, but, they don't just sprinkle the chocolate on top sporadically, their logo is embedded in your coffee, which I must say is a great idea as it leaves you remembering them after. **One of my favourite coffee shops due to the good quality coffee. I dare say not that their cakes disappoint as they do look scrumptious but I'm yet to try and review them. Lost a star based on basic design and also the lack of space, but overall, still worth a visit**",

It was so good; the baristas are sweet; ambiance is lovely and the smell of freshly ground coffee beans lingers around the whole shop.",

    "text": "Popped in here for a quick coffee stop while waiting for my boyfriend in the bookstore next door. Seemed like a cool coffee place and their sign reads \"best espresso in London\" so I figured why not. I asked for a flat white and the barista replied they don't make that. She then told me I could get a macchiato or a latte instead as they are comparable to a flat white. I personally do not agree with that at all. She was also quite rude about it, like I had offended her by trying to order something they don't offer on the menu. I've been to plenty of coffee shops where they will make you a drink not listed all you need to do is ask.I also don't really understand why they wouldn't make a flat white...because it's not an italian style of coffee? I guess they are going for strictly italian cafe, no Aussie/UK style allowed. Since it wasnt crowded and I still wanted coffee I just ordered the latte. It was actually very good and enjoyable. But I won't be back because they don't offer my favourite drink.",

    "text": "Another joint off my coffee bucket list crossed off!I had the cappuccino freddo, which is essentially an iced cappuccino with this lovely, mousse-y frothed milk topping that made everything brilliant. The coffee is balanced well and the baristas are quite capable -- and very efficient. Only problem is that, like every other coffee chain, they cut corners on iced drinks by giving you a TON of ice. With coffee/espresso drinks, I understand the need to cool the hot espresso shots immediately, but I don't particularly like paying for that much ice. That may be more of a corporate strategy thing or what have you, but I do love it when shops give me a proper amount of what I'm asking for, and not frozen water.",

    "text": "I have *opinions* about coffee. Strong enough opinions that I ought to shell out for a serious espresso machine and make my own. Instead, I often end up going to Nero or Starbucks, where what you'll get is far from transcendent but at least somewhat consistent, as long as the milk isn't scalded. I'd always prefer to support a smaller business or a local shop, but have been burned (literally and figuratively) more often than I've been rewarded for it.Enter: Cafe Vergnano 1882I had my first sip of this perfect cappuccino, turned to my partner, and stuttered something incoherent, by which I meant \"This is the best coffee I've had in London\". Smooth in flavour and texture, beautifully finished with a rosetta and their signature 1882 stamp in cocoa powder, and steamed to a temperature that brings out the best in the milk. The only problem with the temperature was that the heat didn't prevent me from downing the whole thing pretty fast!",

    "text": "Vergnano sits in tourist hell, right next to Leicester Square, but it's not the sort of place you'd see from a distance and pop into like you would a Starbucks or a Nero; I had to have it pointed out to me (by someone from out of town!) before I found out about it. Maybe this is why it usually (not always) has a space free for me and whoever I'm indoctrinating this time around.Everyone I have ever brought to this place - including super coffee nerds - has said the coffee is amazing. If you want a meal in a mug, have the hot chocolate; it's practically chewable. They no longer do the square of delicious chocolate, but nonetheless, it's a great place to have in your pocket when you're in the area. Dropping by like it's no biggie is a pro move.",
