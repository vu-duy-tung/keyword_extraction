    "text": "Tinsel Town? What a great name!! Me and my friends literally stumbled upon this place in our drunken states at five o clock in the morning. We'd come from a party in Old Street and somehow ended up in Farringdon at an American Diner, eating huge burgers and falling asleep in our plates. To be fair I can't remember much about this place, other than it has the typical American Diner appearance and menu. I'm actually, now thinking about it guessing they must do an amazing chocolate cake here and when I'm finished dieting I will definitely go back and check out their deserts. The cool thing about Tinsel Town is nobody knows when it closes \u00a0well I'm sure they do- but it's open till such early hours in the morning that ravers never see this place closed. I remember thinking that the burgers were fairly expensive, but I suppose this is the price you pay for wanting American Diner style food at five o clock in the morning with the full restaurant service and all. The only fault with Tinsel Town is it's location, Farringdon isn't necessarily in the thick of all the London action which means it's a trek to get to after a night out and ridiculous to get home from at five in the morning \u00a0then I suppose where isn't hard to get home from at these hours?This place is perfect for going to after a big night out and could be cool for a quirky birthday dinner thing. Tinsel Town is a vampire's heaven.",

I know it a Hala restaurant, but so is Burger King in Singapore and they have the best fast food burgers I've ever tasted. The people at Tinsel Town also can't make milkshakes.

The walls are covered in a slightly suspicious number of photos of the owner posing with A-List Hollywood celebs (Indeed, it now has a Hollywood branch).We both had a chocolate bar based milkshake which were good though I regret getting the Mars and not being more adventurous.Not a bad place, particularly if you can't sleep, though I don't know if I would make the trip there during the day.",

I've never actually eaten downstairs but the burgers that I've ordered for takeaway come in pretty decent sizes and, at least the ones that I've ordered, have a generous amount of toppings. Whilst waiting for my midnight orders, I noticed that other people were having the milkshakes and with such a long list of options, I couldn't help but be tempted. I'm glad I did because even as pricey as they are, their shakes are utterly amazing! I don't think that their burgers are going to win any awards soon but they hit the spot perfectly after a big night out. The fact that they hire a bouncer is a little strange to me, but given the sorts of people you get when you're open 24 hours, I guess it shouldn't surprise me in the least.",

However, Tinseltown seems to have mass employed new waiters, if you can even call them that, from some country in the EU which has open borders with the UK. As a result if you decide to eat at Tinseltown expect your food to be plonked on your table by argumentative, gum chomping, quick to grab your money Tinselswines. Tinseltown should be renamed Fritzltown because it's where decency and manners go to die.One plate plonker decided that he would explain to me over and over again that I had not ordered cheese with my burger and therefore I had to sell my soul to the devil, give him my first born child and pray to Buddha for forgiveness if I was ever to see a slice of cheese on my burger.Be aware of the service charge that they put on the receipt. They know that no-one in their right mind tips a a right royal teacosy. You do not have to pay for the luxury of being on the end on abysmal customer service skills. Also, the plate plonkers will hover around your table like vultures on a carcase as you count your money. However, It has to be said that the entertainment was excellent and mind blowing. I've never seen such skill and precision when it comes to a eating a burger; navigating around a veil draped around the hole in your face.Lastly, the toilets look a smell like pisspits.",

Going to the 'American-style diner' late at night means being greeted at the door by bouncers who don't seem to realise they aren't working at one of the nearby Smithfield clubs. You could almost understand where they might be confused, as the restaurant is packed with fussily-dressed club goers, which makes things awkward if you're just looking for a midnight snack. But what's most annoying is that they claim to be open 24 hours, but actually close between 7 and 10am for cleaning. This is especially ridiculous considering they have a breakfast menu. The main attraction of the diner, their milkshakes, are still a nice treat and probably some of the best in London, though they are rather small for the price. If you find yourself with a craving, you'd do better to get to their Hampstead outpost which is still open until 2am.",

    "text": "The milkshakes get 4 stars. They're pretty inventive, although inappropriately expensive (\u00a34.75 because it has some Kinder Bueno in it? I don't think so.)The food is budget. I'm talking Captain Birdseye quality beef burgers and the type of seasame seed buns you'd find in the local cornershop with a 6 month shelf life. I'd recommend Byron. You'll pay a similar price, get a beautiful bit of beef (with bacon if you want. Tinseltown is halal only, so not pork here). And Byron milkshakes are much more satisfying (if not a bit more plain)Really disappointed. Waitress plonked down our main course before we had even finished our starter (which was overpowered by a gallon of BBQ sauce). Really inattentive waitress took 15 minutes to take our order in the first place. Yet she brought the bill (with the service charge, ha!) within a minute.Go there for a milkshake. Avoid the food. Go to Byron if you want a bit of both, with better food and extremely attentive service!(I haven't reviewed on this site in years. I was SO disappointed with this place I felt compelled to write about it.)",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that traditional British food is terrible. For American students studying/traveling abroad, Tinseltown is a shining star. For a moment, you may actually think you're home. As far as American diners in London, go, I give it three stars. If this same diner was in Philadelphia, I'd give it half of one star. I hope that message resonates with any Britons reading this review. (hint: I tried your diner, now come here and try ours!)I ate here several times during my summer in London. The milkshakes are a little watery by American standards but it's the best you're going to find in London. I appreciated their effort to make me feel at home. Their other desserts seemed adequately American. The chicken fingers look more like french fries than anything else. That was a huge let down but, again, they tried. Oddly, they brewed a kick butt espresso! It left me bouncing off buildings all the way back to my flat on Bowling Green (yeah Islington!). And what's up with the use of salad cream (their take on salad dressing) and brown sauce (supposedly their take on BBQ sauce). Both were readily available in packet form in a plastic cup on the table. Odd. Very odd. This place was perfect for a late-night meal after hitting the pubs. I can't say that I'd go for lunch or dinner (or 100% sober). My favorite lunch spot \u00a0is Wagamama - I'll review that next.So, this place is a must try but don't expect to get much out of your visit than the comforting feeling of home.",

We were both happy when they arrived and pleased by how delicious they were.

Their excuse was that they thought he meant 1pm the day before, even though he called at 3pm so that would've made no sense. Fortunately it was quiet enough for them to find space for us in one of the booths.The atmosphere was lacking. Photographs of celebrities from a decade ago lined the walls in cheap picture frames, and while there was music it was very quiet (not a bad thing when you want to talk to people). At one point the a siren went off and the speakers started to boom. Celebrities appeared on the screens to wish TinselTown a Happy Birthday - It was far worse than your usual sing-song and seemed to go on forever.The lunch menu is very cheap. A chicken burger is \u00a35 or you can get a double for an extra \u00a31.. This price includes a side dish and sauce. You could order a 4 patty burger challenge which comes with 2 sides and dips for just \u00a312. My burger was ok. Nothing special but then it is cheap so can I really complain?The milkshake - Fruit A-List - was thick. But I really enjoyed it. A strawberry and banana \u00a0ice-cream milkshake with strawberry sauce and fruit pieces, topped with whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles. It was more like pudding than a drink but that's what I hoped for.Perhaps 2 stars is a little harsh but it all comes down to expectations. I was hoping for a nice diner, maybe something like All Star Lanes. This was a bit dark and dingy. If you want food similar to McDonalds then you'll be happy, but I really believe it could do much better.",

The different styles burgers were all pretty unimpressive with many nothing like you'd find anywhere in the states. And for \u00a39 a burger! I couldn't finish this crap.My friends got the milkshakes and seemed to like them but that doesn't make up for the most pathetic of all burgers. The atmosphere was in a basement, sad and run down. They played this obnoxious birthday video over and over that just showed celebrities with bad music throughout the meal. Otherwise the TVs showed music videos and commercials. At no point did the waiter or staff ask us if we enjoyed our meal. I now know why.",

My colleagues explained this was the spot for such a confection and upon seeing the extensive menu (they have over 50 flavours to choose from) I could easily tell they were right.I admit I made the classic mistake of not realising that less is almost always more. Rather than getting a simple shake - strawberry, peanut butter and banana, Oreo cookie - I plunged into a candy bar filled ice cream disaster that left me feeling ill three sips in. I have since learned my lesson.The sandwiches - burgers, chicken, etc - are sized to the max so bring your appetite. They also do take away so if you want to run with your shake or sandwich (i.e. eat in a closet so no one can see you decimating a day's worth of calories in one go) it's pretty hassle free to do so.",

It's in a basement and its beyond cheesy, bordering on creepy. Framed celebrities stare out at you from the wall. They also make large groups pay in advance which just ramps up the sketchiness. BUT at least they never close.",

    "text": "Very nasty. the place is unclean and unkempt and smells rather off,and the tables are awkwardly placed which is a shame because the place isn't even that small. It gets better towards the back where there are more traditional booths but our table was not cleaned properly even though it hadn't had anyone on it for a while. The waiter was nice though and so was my fererro rocher milkshake which is why I'm giving it 2 instead of 1. But sorry...The food was disgusting. Overpriced and horrible tasting chicken burger and cheap, clearly shop bought chips. I wish they gave you the option of what sauce you want or don't want on your burger because mine had a very bizarre and tangy one that I didn't like and I had to scrape it off. Don't go here except to pick up a milkshake! And even then don't expect anything Creams can't give you.",

    "text": "My girlfriend - bless her- is totally in love with this place. Sometimes, I feel she loves Tinseltown more than me, therefore I had high expectations for this all-American Diner.As my girlfriend gleefully skipped down the stairs into this underground \"diner\", I couldn't help but feel somewhat uneasy. It was dark, dingy and had a funny smell - I felt I was making my way down into a brothel rather than a restaurant.Before I review the food, I must highlight the type of customers this place attracts.........TEENS. Not just any teens, the Loud-Mouthed-I'm-God's-Gift-To-Earth kind of teens. As you sit there shifting through the menu to decide upon what to order, the unbearable noise coming from the TV (MTV I think it's called), the annoying teens and the rude staff all start to get on your nerves.The food is nothing special. I wasn't blown away by the taste, especially considering the price. The portions could be considered generous, but us Brits are catching up to Americans in portion size. The milkshakes are very good, but quite pricey.When you consider the price and atmosphere, it really falls short of my expectations. If you like good milkshakes, then I would recommend it just for that.",

We were both craving dessert and as this was nearby, popped in and as always - it satisfied our sweet tooth. Haven't been to Tinseltown in years and could see that nothing had changed with this place regarding the decor. everything was the same, the service was quite quick considering how busy they were, but this didn't affect the quality of our order as the quality of the milkshakes and desserts was terrific as expected. First time my friend came here and he was pleasantry surprised. If in the area again will definitely pop in.",

So i couldn't really eat them without getting a mouth full of plastic. The second time i went i dined in. The food was ok. Then there was a massive fight between two tables of teenagers, which the security that always stand outside seemed to do nothing about, until i complained. Wasn't the most pleasant dining experience even if it's just for some fast food.",

Great food (it was after a night out so as my grandmother would say \"hunger is very good sauce\"), a great malt, very friendly staff but you will pay for the experience and possibly have to wait for it as well and queues are a regular thing to get to this basement venue.

As my flatmate would say, it's \"redic.com\" that they don't sell booze or hard shakes, considering they serve food that a drunk or a child would crave.The burger menu is extensive and it's a meat eaters dream. It's a little gloomy in here with no natural light but don't let that fool you into thinking it's romantic. Oh no, far from it. Even more so when it's someones birthday and they have this terrifying happy birthday song and video. Secretly I just jealous that no one planned this for my birthday!So as far as American diners go, this one is nasty, but the kinda nasty I love. That makes you glad you've chosen this venue with friends because it's okay to laugh at yourself for loving something that's so wrong.",

When Lizzie G. suggested that we leave the swanky and wanky wine bar we were in and head to a 'really cool American diner' I was like yes! I love kitsch American diners with fries and milkshakes, but much like Mexican food, they do not do diners well here. They can try, but they fail. I should have known by the hazard tape on the stairs that this was just a dive and not a 'dive' in the fun, ironic way.The place was full of teenagers. They had awful, outdated pictures of celebrities on the wall and tv screens showing terrible music videos, I just felt old. Menu is full of 'American' food, which looks bad. They don't even serve booze and trust me, you need it here!Bleagh, no thanks Tinseltown, I'll keep looking for my authentic American diner experience... maybe in America.",
