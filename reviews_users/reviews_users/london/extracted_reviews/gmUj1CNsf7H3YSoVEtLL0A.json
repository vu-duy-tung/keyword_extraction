    "text": "Terrible. The only thing good about this place is the view. My boyfriend and I tried to go up early on a weekend just to the bar for literally one drink. I knew you had to make reservations to eat, which we were just in the area so we wanted to check it out. You walk into a separate entrance all together and there is a concierge at the bottom. We asked her if we could go for a drink, she said yeah. OBVIOUSLY we wouldn't have gone all the way up if we knew they were full. We were met by a very rude gentleman and we stated we wanted to check out the bar and view. He stated that if we didn't have reservations we couldn't get in. He was so rude and condescending towards us. It was as though because I didn't have on a label that day I couldn't get in. Needless to say, we won't be going back. I worked in high end hospitality and restaurants and bars, first off the girl at the bottom should have told us there wasn't availability. And secondly they should look to employ some genuine and nice people. Words can't even describe the cold and rude \"welcoming\" this place gave us.The best part for me is we were going to check out the venue and see if we could rent it out/ part of it for my fianc\u00e9's company. \u00a0Too bad for them.",

The recommendation for a slightly sweet wine was like drinking syrup. I could go on but I think you can make your own decision from here. The view is the only reason they received two stars - and they seriously need to clean the windows, since that is the ONLY thing special about this place.",

    "text": "Another visit to the Shard and thoughts would try Aqua for my Sisters Birthday. Nicely welcomed and promptly seated with another welcome by the manager when at our table. The views as always don't disappoint and our booth was a good size for the five of us. A nice glass of champagne kicked off the evening. Apart from myself the others in my party were slightly surprised by only one veggie on the main course menu. Although the staff did mention the chef would be happy to propose another option it seemed as though what could be done was very limited. In the end 3 of the group went for the mixed vegetables wit feta cheese option ( from the menu ), with my sister opting for the proposed second option ( Barley rice take on risotto). The appetizers were excellent , mackerel and beet dish was amazing and the added flavoring from the mouse really finished it nicely. Both my mum and sister enjoyed the leek soup and the rest of the group were also pleased with their choices. The veggie main went down well and my rump of lamb was perfectly cooked and well garnished , presentation was excellent .Dessert was also good with us trying a number of different choices - the David's mess was fantastic and really left my palate feeling fresh. The dessert wine and coffee brought the evening to a nice close. A great setting and getting a booking around 40 minutes before sunset is really worth it so you can enjoy the fantastic views of London during both daylight and when lit up for the evening.",

    "text": "Aqua Shard : come hungry. Leave hungry, and poor.It started out not great, just trying to find where to go in. I knew the entrance was by the hotel so off I trotted. There was basically no sign posting (except for a carved stone sign that was pointing to the wrong direction, and \u00a0half-hidden behind a topiary). Eventually though I found the door - to the right of the hotel - and up we went. The lifts are automated with signs and recordings to not push the buttons - why they don't just cover them with a panel I don't know. So you go up to the 32nd floor, and then have to walk down stairs to the 31st. We arrived at 17.58 but were told we couldn't go to our table yet as the restaurant wasn't open until 18.00 (our reservation time) and they told us to take a seat and they'd get us a drink (spoiler alert - they never did). As we were sitting, I could see the restaurant - empty, of course - and the bar area. The bar area seemed to have the better views, and it was quite lively. They started seating people at about 18:05, so we stood up and went back to wait for our table by the hostess stand. And waited, and waited, while the front of house manager greeted and sat other people. We were told to sit again and wait, with some excuse about the chef finalising a dish. What? I didn't say a word but clearly my face showed my disapproval as we were then told the first round of drinks would be on the house. So we waited some more and finally got our table - at about 18.15. I know 15 minutes isn't a huge delay, but the way it was handled was crap, and considering the restaurant was empty and the tables were all set. We were offered champagne by the front of house manager (not really the same as the first round of drinks, as we had no choice what to order). I declined, as I don't drink alcohol and said as much. We were then offered a fruit juice cocktail, which we accepted. I asked for tap water, and the pompous head waiter replied, \"Yes madam, London water\". I think that sums it up (note - he brought cucumber water. Gag. At that point, I just accepted it and left it).5 minutes later, a different waiter comes over with 2 champagnes. I said no thank you, I don't drink - and the waiter got defensive and odd. \"It's free. Why don't you want it?\" I have no reason for not drinking - I just don't like alcohol and it doesn't agree with me. But what if I was pregnant, an alcoholic, on medication? It's not his business. Luckily the front of house manager saw the exchange and called off the waiter but still.The food choice was naff. There was a steak for 2 people - \u00a3120. 1kg. As we're not cavemen, that was out - and with only 4 fish, 4 meat, and 1 vegetarian option on the mains, we were limited. I had the veggie option (lentil gnocchi) and my husband had the saddle of lamb. The food took a good 45 minutes to arrive. We did have some nice bread in the interim but come on. No one ever came to take a further drinks order. The view was good, of course, but the place we were sitting by the window didn't look out onto any landmarks, and the way you sit kind of oddly next to each other but facing different directions isn't the most social. Perhaps that's why it was so loud in the restaurant - it was full, and with no carpeting or tablecloths, the noise was enough to give me ringing ears when we left.When our food finally came, it was a huge let down. Tasty and beautifully plated, yes. But I've easily had larger starters than my main. 8 gnocchi, each about a centimetre square - no exaggeration. 2 carrot batons, and what I think was 2 french beans cut into 6 pieces. It came in a veloute (read: soup) but there was no spoon to eat it with. Not that there was really any point in dirtying a spoon for my 3 drops of veloute. Husband's lamb was nice. It came with a potato fondant that was clearly made from a new potato. We also had some fried jersey royals with a spicy tomato sauce on top. They were okay, but the jersey flavour that I was so looking forward to was ruined by the frying and the tomato sauce.Pudding was again tasty but minuscule - the peanut jelly (which wasn't jelly-like, luckily) on the mousse was a highlight. After 2 hours to have 2 courses, we were quite ready to go. I got the bill, which was \u00a380 (including a 12.5% service charge). I put down my \u00a3100 voucher and when the waitress came back to take it, she asked if we wanted anything else since there wouldn't be change. I said that's fine, we know, we're done though, thanks. She rolled her eyes at me (why?!) and left. I can't see any reason to return!",

Starters: delightful, stylish, tasty, various options can fit almost all situations like if you prefer something light or soup or fish (their Trout and Spring leek soup are great!3 Mean course: super with they grilled beef and their monkfish was to perfection. They all very well presented and tender, tastes great with a great blend of favours. If you can get the right wind with them, you will discover another world of palate.3.

We went in and as my boyfriend had requested a table by the window, we had to wait at the bar, however neither of us minded. He ordered an espresso martini and I had a Tom Collins. Both cocktails were really well made and delicious and served in stylish martini glasses. The menu was the set lunch menu and we opted for three courses. I had the smoked salmon starter and the duck for main with a chocolate pudding for dessert. The food was okay, kind of what you'd expect from a normal British restaurant.The service was good and as it was my birthday, they even gave a separate dessert at the end which was a nice touch. I think that overall it's a nice treat for a special occasion and I think we both had a really nice time, however I don't think that the food was as good as I expected. Maybe my expectation for the Shard was very high (no pun intended) and I did enjoy the experience. I later found out that my boyfriend had chosen this restaurant because in the men's toilets, when using the urinal (which apparently is backed against the glass window), you feel like you are peeing over London!! \u00a0 Charming eh?",

Well, we were soooo wrong and soooo hungry and soooo broke after the experienve! No problems with the servers though, in fact, they babied us that I thought they would even burp us after our meal. But the food...goodness. Fancy names for crappy and tiny meals. We started with an appetizer called The Hornish Crab, damn thing was so small, I thought we were being PUNK'D! For nearly \u00a320 we thought there was more coming so we waited and waited and my stomached growled. We then ordered the main \"entree\" some fancy name for FRIGGING BAKED BROCCOLI with what looked like other people's leftovers. We are all hungry and mad to pay \u00a320 frigging pounds for FRIGGING BROCCOLI! My poor child asked me \"Mommy, are we poor?

The other options looked enticing, and the full English in particular was enormous! Coffee and pastries were both beautifully presented.Service was good, but overall Aqua has some work to do if they are striving for perfection. The staff got our table's order wrong several times, and the toast was so hard it was almost impossible to slice. The pain au chocolat was too much pain and not enough chocolat! If you get the opportunity to visit Aqua Shard it's probably worthwhile and certainly more relaxed than some of London's other skyline bars.

She got so annoyed they sent someone over, who then forgot the name of the wine and had to come back. Arrival to wine arriving took 40 minutes. Not only was that ruining our enjoyment, it's also bad business. How can you make money if you don't serve drinks? They need to hire some more staff and sort it out.Meanwhile, the views are incredible and the bar itself is very nice to sit in with a good buzzy atmosphere. Too bad it's let down by the actual functioning of the bar. In fact, we had intended to go here for cocktails but no one fancied anything on the menu, which isn't a very good sign especially from me given my cocktail addiction.The toilets involve those kind of doors it's difficult not to walk into BUT they have an incredible view. I love toilets with a view.",

    "text": "The views are wonderful, as you would expect, but I had high hopes for the food and I was left thoroughly disappointed. Yes I went for lunch, on a week day and so the atmosphere was completely corporate and boring - lots of people trying to be 'important' and discuss equally 'important' things. This was also to be expected I suppose, however the man that seated me with his earpiece was rude and completely unaccommodating, it was like he took an instant disliking to me and couldn't hide it. My enquiry for a different table was met with complete lack of patience and disdain - not what you expect when you spend over 250 pounds on a quick lunch for 2!Then there was the food - bland, and of surprisingly poor quality. The beet salad starter was overpowered by vinegar and the cod was on the verge of being raw. Desert (David's mess) was sugar on sugar and lost the flavour of any fruits that were hidden away despite their gorgeous colours - very disappointing indeed.The cocktails, however were great - I imagine the bar in the evening is buzzy and fun, and the same at the weekend.",

Honestly...You don't pay for anything but a drink~ I think a glass of wine my friend had was about 8 quid if i remember correctly...and my champagne cocktail was 15...I was bad and had another glass of just champagne i think was 14 quid~ (if you go to a fancy, nice bar you're looking to pay that much for drinks ANYWAY...but here at Aqua you get the amazing view...Of course you can't expect the food to be amazing~~ i mean come on... you go for the VIEW. I went on a Wednesday... I read a couple of the reviews beforehand about the long queues~ But on Wednesday night it was awesome... it wasn't empty..but it wasn't packed~ we sat around the bar and then saw a table around the corner and sat there and enjoyed the awesome view. What i liked: 1. The view2. The ambiance (very posh & just makes you feel great to be literally looking down on London) 3. champagne cocktails (yummmmy~)4. the staff was really friendly (to us at least) bartender was French~ waitress and waiter were italian and spanish (all asked where we were from~ etc) 5. THE BATHROOM- i was quite impressed. I mean Aqua itself is beautiful, the stairwell the view...but the bathroom was memorable for me~",

    "text": "\"Bad service. Bad food. Bad drinks. Unclean glasses & utensils. All for \u00a3203+.\"I never understood why people are willing to pay top dollar to eat bland, average food - like the stuff your mum used to make - at a top notch restaurant, then exalt the whole experience as if they just met Jesus Christ. Incarnate.What are my qualifications? I've eaten at some top places in the U.S. - meaning I've spent over \u00a3300 for dining for two. Plus I've waited previously at fine restaurants (requiring pleated shirts and bowties), banquet halls, diners and more. So I know what is supposed to be done, when, how and why. At all times.Place looks fantastic. Honestly. Course it's strictly average for New York City (where I live), but it's posh so... marks for that.1. Waiting 15-20 mins for any waitstaff to bring menus or even water. Unacceptable in a place so \"posh\".2. Wine glasses were COMPLETELY covered in lint and dirty - read, soap, water stains AND fingerprints. They even attempted to pour our wine in them. What a class act!!3. Silverware was so knackered - it looked as if it all was used in World War I & II, Vietnam and Desert Storm. That's just cheap.4. Waited 20 mins for our drinks. Unacceptable. 5. When drinks finally arrived, I discovered they left the Bulleit bourbon out of my Royal Julep (Bulleit, Domaine de Canton, Lime juice, sugar, Champagne). Sound good? Not if you're paying over \u00a316 for a drink they \"stiffed\" you on - but hey, it makes them more money, right?6. Poached & Roasted Hen Of the Woods - is actually a vegetable. Unless it's public knowledge, like on the level of I don't know... WHO'S YOUR QUEEN, it should be clarified on the menu. Otherwise people might think they're ordering wildfowl.7. Slow Poached Veal Fillet. Point to note: if main part of the dish is THAT good, you don't need to obscure the taste. It's best left with minimal garnishments, etc. This came out like p\u00e2t\u00e9 and tasted like baby food. Nasty.8. Irish hake glazed in brown chicken sauce. The crabmeat was canned. How do I know - I'm a seafood lover and have eaten enough of both canned and fresh to know the difference. In short, it tasted bad. Returned this dish for the Cumbrian hogget shoulder cooked overnight. That was ok.9. Every dish - the portions were way too small. Just because you pay more and get smaller portions doesn't make you any more of a food connoisseur than it makes the dish haute cuisine.10. For God's sake, SPEAK ENGLISH PROPERLY!! I don't care if it's British or American. And FYI, I speak Chinese Mandarin (also read / write), Italian, French, some Spanish and Russian as well. If I wanted a \"foreign experience\" I'd specifically go to some place where the native language isn't English.11. Table sections aren't assigned to individual servers. This typically results in far poorer attentiveness from the staff (they tried clearing my girlfriend's drink - still 1/2 full - off the table!, intrusive behavior - too many interruptions and as I mentioned - too long of a wait for everything.12. Wine recommendations. When I asked for a recommendation on some of the red, the staff began explaining what a Merlot is like versus a Cab and so on. What kind of silly prats dine here?? And how is it in a \"posh\" place that no one has a concept of what the wines are like on the list. I had to learn all the dishes and memorize them - including the drinks so I could aid customers and \"upsell\". 13. The ladies restroom light was out - so, all the women had to pee in complete darkness.Summary: the owner(s) of this place are clearly trying to screw the customers and line their own pockets with hoards of cash. You saps are giving it to them. I know, I was one. But I won't be again.If you think the food was great, service is top, and food menu selection was plentiful (it wasn't), then you're a silly tw-t and I feel sorry for the people that know you.More importantly, if you're not - I pray you never go here. Best assiduously avoided at all costs. But if you must impress someone - just order a bottle of wine and enjoy the view. This place isn't worth any more than that.",

    "text": "Absolutely exceptional. My parents were in town visiting from New Zealand and I thought I'd take them to a place that has that wow factor. Being the new(ish) kid on the block I thought Aqua Shard would be ideal. My goodness how right I was. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived.I had booked a table via the website where I'd also added the notes that I have a gluten and onion intolerance. Shortly after we sat down and was given some time to check the menu one of the waiters came over to check who had the allergy. He then went through the items on the menu that I was interested in informing me of what I could have and what could be modified to meet my requirements. It was so great! One thing I find really hard about dining out is having to explain my intolerances and really feeling like a burden and a pain in the butt, but the waiter at Aqua Shard really made me feel at ease.When we ordered our drinks the bar tender came over to answer any questions about the wine list we had and I asked for a non alcoholic cocktail. He asked me what kind of flavour I was after. I said fruity and he immediately (this really impressed me) asked if I had any fruit allergies. I said apples and pears. He said perfect then went away and within minutes presented me with a wonderful pineapple, passionfruit and mint cocktail. Amazing.The food itself was delicious. I can't fault it. The chicken was beautifully cooked to perfection, the steak was juicy and tender and the halibut was lovely - the sauce complimented it beautifully. \u00a0The butternut pumpkin and broccoli sides were good too. And those desserts! Mouth watering! The eton mess was not what you'd usually find in an eton mess in that it wasn't messy... more like tidy! but it was yummy! The dark chocolate tart was delicious - warm and very rich and the vanilla cheesecake had a really nice texture and the sorbet was very tasty. It had more subtle flavours so not overly sweet but just right. And that view. ... just wow. We arrived in plenty of times to get photos of London before the sun set then watched as the sun sunk below London and gave way to night. It was very impressive. The toilets are quite an experience too! Loos with a view. Yes, it is pricey but if you think about the fact you have to pay \u00a325 to go up to the viewing deck, why not pay to go up for dinner instead. The experience is worth it. I'd certainly go back!",

Over all Service was poor, food O.K and the price was not worth it. A Full English for two came to approximately \u00a370 in total. This included two hot drinks and Orange juice. When we were seated we were made to feel the orange juice was a welcome free drink! So we were surprised when O.J cost \u00a35 each on the bill! Regards the food itself, it seemed very far from an English breakfast. There were hash browns? American; Spinach and curried beans ? Indian breakfast; cottage cheese - why? Awkward food and doubly awkward vibe. Our waiter told us our poached eggs were scrabbled eggs when they arrived. Mind you if he was reading the menu I can see how he was confused! \u00a0Type errors in a menu? That's just LAZY! The haRsh Browns ( exactly how it is spelt in the menu!!) we're as Harsh as the price here. I would not recommend this place for the food or atmosphere. What's the big deal about the view? You can get the same view from top of Guys hospital tower opposite the road.",

    "text": "Unfortunately not the experience it was built up to be. \u00a0First the building looks impressive from the outside but that all changes when you get in. After an automated non stop lift to the 32nd floor you arrive at the restaurant bar and over look the floor plan as you're actually a floor above where you need to be. And from here you can see the start of the problems. It is rammed. You cannot see floor space and as such people squeezing through bumping each other etc. \u00a0Anyway we where shown to our table, a window seat with great views. Well, what would have been great views had the glass been clean. It was like looking into a mist. If you own a glass building, keeping it clean is a must. After about a ten minute wait our waitress arrived but rather than a welcome or greeting her first words were to tell us we had an hour and a half and would then have to leave!!! Then left!!! Brilliant, a time limit and then she leaves without us being able to order. A few minutes later another waitress arrives and reads out the menu whilst staring out the window without any eye contact, very robotic,Takes our order and leaves. The service is shocking. Not personal at all. When the food arrives it does look good but again the bread was slightly stale and the cakes where dry - and to top it of my scone crumbled as soon as I looked at it. We were now in the mode of finish up and leave as quick as possible. For a relatively new establishment it was tired, appeared dirty and had the feel of a factory . There are 4 restaurants in the Shard and they may all be great but this wasn't and has set a tone for the whole place and wasn't the best. For the price you pay there are much better afternoon teas. The Dorchester, Ritz or Savoy. They may not have the views but each have there own special attraction.",

    "text": "This is a large restaurant and bar on the 31st floor, with huge panoramic windows providing stunning views over the City of London and Westminster. My guess is that almost everyone who eats here comes for that reason - and the views are just as good by night, as by day - weather permitting.The lift whisks you up to the 32nd floor, from where you descend via an open staircase into the double-height atrium bar, which is certainly very impressive.As a restaurant, it's quite high end, but for me it does not provide a matching dining experience. The menu is expensive - expect two courses to cost around \u00a360-\u00a370 a head depending on your choice, and you need to add in drinks and service. There's not a lot of choice for vegetarians, but the menu does have the most comprehensive coding system I have ever seen for allergies - not just nuts, dairy and gluten, but celery and other items as well - a total of 14 items.I found the food to be very good, but not outstanding. My spring leek soup with nettles and goat's curd (\u00a312) \u00a0- one of those poured in front of you from a little jug - was not just short on quantity, but a little bland and luke-warm rather than hot. Starters came with excellent bread and butter. Better was the new spring vegetable main (\u00a319), which had nicely seasoned and well cooked barley and came with feta cheese. A campanion's steak (\u00a349.50) was very good and cooked as requested. The house white at \u00a335 was perfectly nice - and there are reds at similar prices - but you can pay up to \u00a31,900 for a Chateau Lafit Rothschild Burgundy...Service was very good, to the point of being ever so slightly intrusive - glasses being whisked away the moment you'd finished, that sort of thing, There are time limits depending on the size of your dining party - two hours is normal for four people. And there's a dress code of 'elegant casual' so be warned. The main downer for me was the noise volume: with low ceilings and lots of glass, the noise circulates, and we could have done without the piped disco music from the bar, which was simply unpleasant.So, overall, it's an experience, and the views are undeniably great, but you're paying for the view.",

Now, you will get eyed up as you go in (Casual Elegance is the dress code, I despise that phrase but basically no sports gear). That's ok though, just dress nicely, don't wear trainers. That said, when we were up there we saw plenty of folks in trainer and sports gear... Once you're up it's really nice, there's plenty of room and we managed to get a table pretty quickly (you may need to keep your eyes peeled). The cocktails are actually excellent and you can order off menu easily enough (I went for a pisco sour and we also got a very niche vespa). The staff are friendly and not at all pretentious. In terms of food - I have a table booked, check back later! Best thing about all this (as a man, sorry ladies) is that you can look out on an amazing view of London as you wee. I'd recommend popping up if you're visiting London or want to go up / grab a fancy drink.",

    "text": "My fianc\u00e9 and I had the most wonderful experience here. Everything was wonderful after we passed the hostess. She was rude, inconsiderate, and disrespectful. We checked in with her for our reservation for afternoon tea 15 minutes early, so she told us to hang out at the bar. Totally okay, the bar area had a wonderful view and we were approached by a waitress who told us to take a seat by the window (which we thought were reserved) and brought us our drinks. My fianc\u00e9 asked me to go check in with the hostess again once our official reservation time was up, and she looked at me like she had no idea who I was (I just saw her 15 minutes prior) and whether or not I was speaking English. When I said I was checking in again, she continued to stare at me blankly, but handed off menus to another hostess to have us seated. The seat that they put us at was in an awkward corner where we couldn't really see anything except the corners of the building. I had put specifically in my reservation request to have a window seat with a view, and this was not what I had imagined. My fianc\u00e9 saw another table nearby with a better view that was available, so we went back to the hostess and asked to switch seats, and she answered with a roll of her eyes, LUCKILY, the manager came right at that moment and we ignored the hostess altogether and asked her if we could move seats, and she was more than happy to do so.After we moved seats, I was extremely happy about the service. Our waiter (and I so wish I remembered his name! Tall, lean and refined young gentleman) was very attentive and made sure we were comfortable and happy. He made a comment that we were actually sitting in his favorite seat in the house, so we were even more ecstatic. He even offered to take a photo for us, even though we never asked! HE WAS SO SWEET! We ordered champagne with our afternoon tea, and we couldn't have been happier with the service, quality of tea, and quality of food. Towards the end of our meal, another staff member came by our table and dropped off a plate with \"CONGRATULATIONS\" written in chocolate syrup across it, with a sweet treat and berries added (we are very newly engaged). We were so humbled by the gesture, and it really topped off the entire experience. So moral of the story, BEWARE OF THE HOSTESS. She's a total b****. But have faith in the restaurant itself, they will serve you well. If you are in a rush, I would not recommend coming here... but my number one rule is, you should never be in a rush to enjoy a nice treat or meal. If you are in a rush, you should probably go elsewhere. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this place for amazing views, food, and tea!",

    "text": "The first thing the hostess said to us as we asked about a table for dinner was, \"You need to order a main course for each person.\"Exqueeeeeeze me? I should have turned around and left right there. Their assumption that every guest that walks in is a freeloader for the view is more than disconcerting. It sets up a terrible repartee from the moment the customer interacts with the establishment.I won't bore you with other details, since they didn't mean nearly as much as the WORST SERVICE EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. Bullet pointed below, to make it easy for your reading pleasure:- ordered food and wine at 9:30pm- wine served - stale bread served at 9:50- food served at 10:05 .... LUKE WARM AT BEST!!!At this point, we don't see another person for another 30 minutes. No one asks us how the food is, what they can get us, nothing. And we're starving, so we eat. The taste of the food was fine (he got pork belly and filet and I got steak filet), but at \u00a350 for the steak I expect a friggin masterpiece!!! When a filet is good, your hand and knife should do barely any work. I had to shake the table to cut the steak.... but I digress.- plates clear at 10:45, after sitting empty on the table for about 15 minutes- server asks how everything was, we say not great and explain it all, she says she'll send over a manager- 15 MINUTES LATER AND NO MANAGER, no one at all- we get up and walk to the bar, hoping that will spur someone... it did- a manager finally comes over to us at the bar and asks what is wrong, we explain, again- he offers to buy us dessert - UM NO THANKS - and then hands us the check sans service charge and says, \"Come back, we'll do better.\"Again, exqueeeeeeze me? He should have comped our bottle of wine at the least, and the entire meal at the most. Service in NYC, LA, Chicago, Paris, Rome, you name it, would never exist like this. And if it did, the establishment would/SHOULD do everything in their power to have the customer leaving satisfied. $205 in the hole, can't say that I am.I'll never go back again, and I'll tell everyone this story too. So good luck, Aqua, riding the coat tails of The Shard and its views.",

The second we stepped off the elevator and into the dining room, we knew immediately that the view made it 100% worth it, regardless of what the food tasted like (though turns out it was delicious!). The sweeping panorama of London is truly breathtaking through the floor to ceiling windows. What a classy place. Would definitely recommend it- though it's pricey.",

    "text": "ZERO STARS IF I COULD GIVE IT. This restaurant has the dubious honour of having perhaps the worst service ever at any restaurant I've dined at in recent memory. 1 star for the nice view over London and the fact that the food is edible. Our reservation was made for 9pm since there weren't any other slots. To their credit, when we arrived the restaurant was very busy indeed, so at least they weren't lying about their lack of availability. Service was poor from the very beginning. We had to flag down a waiter for literally every single request, including the essentials like water and menus. Oddly enough, the glass of wine that I ordered to accompany my main course came out very quickly, even before the bread and butter was brought to the table. At this point, the couple that had arrived at the same time we did finally gave up and walked out of the restaurant after being ignored the entire time. Our food came out after a bit of a wait, although not unbearably long - it was actually not bad; the ingredients were high-quality and tasty enough, although my scallop appetizer was a bit small. After we finished our main courses, someone plopped down another serving of bread and butter, which we found a bit odd. At this point we had already invested enough time and money into our meal, so we decided to go all in and get dessert too. I ordered the mille-feuile and a green tea, yet nothing came out for over 15 minutes, so once again we flagged down our unapologetic waiter - there was no way that they were making mille-feuilles from scratch, and making tea is a matter of putting hot water and leaves in a teapot. Sadly, the tea was not steeped properly and the mille-feuille was a sad heap of puff pasty that had disintegrated into a soggy mess. We were ready to ask for the bill and leave, but once again, our waiter was unavailable - we noticed that he was busy chatting with another table, which had been the case for a significant part of the night. At this point, we asked to speak with the manager. She listened to our complaints, but ultimately didn't do much other than give an insincere apology and offer to comp the tea from the bill. Sadly a 12.5% \"service\" charge is added automatically, which we found rather insulting given our disappointing experience. As stated in other reviews, the poor service here really turns what should be a pleasant dining/drinking experience into an ordeal. For such a high-end restaurant, the service standards are simply abhorrent - if management thinks that the view alone can keep this place in business then they are sorely mistaken.",

    "text": "So wish I'd read these reviews before heading to Aqua Shard for breakfast. It sounds like my experience echoes a lot of other Yelp users' experiences as well i.e. not impressed. Alex S. put it better than I ever could (as it sounds nearly exactly like what happened to us), but I just felt that the overall experience - from the atmosphere to the decor to the food was just so-so for what is promoted as an upscale restaurant. Honestly? I much prefer the food, service and views at Duck & Waffle. The menu at Aqua Shard was nothing out of the ordinary and the quality was mediocre, at best. The muffin as part of the \"selection of pastries\" (which were miniature versions of pastries, smaller than my palm) was dry. The other pastries, however, (pain au chocolat, pain aux raisin, croissant) were flaky, delicious and served warm. Our lobster benedict was tasty and the lobster well-seasoned.Service was sporadic to non-existent. Our teas didn't arrive until after our mains were served and I would have liked to have it with our pastries. After the pastries had been taken away, we were left with the jams, which confused me - should I slather this on my lobster benedict? Are there more pastries to come? Sadly, I'll never know.Despite not having been open for *that* long, the decor looked worn and tired. Our table had chips to the surface and scratches - it felt like dining in a relic of the 90s. The view was lovely ... if you have a table by the window. Aqua Shard specifically states on its website that you cannot reserve window seats, which I understood, but if you're sitting at a table away from the window, the atmosphere is lacklustre and the tables are situated in such a way that you can't really see very well beyond those whose tables and chairs are literally touching the glass. Great for them. I did think about taking my friends and family here when they're visiting London, but I think I'll stick to the views elsewhere.",

On my first visit we were lucky enough to be given a corner window table. The service here is great and the staff are really helpful. The cakes and sandwiches are delicious and they have good selection of teas. We spent a nice few hours eating, chatting and drinking tea. As the sun starts to set, you get a whole new view as day to turns to dusk and then to night. Although it's not cheap, it's a wonderful place to take someone as a special treat.My second occasion I was lucky enough to be taken out for diner with a group of associates. We had such a good time. The food was amazing, as was the atmosphere. Once again the staff were friendly, professional and nothing was too much trouble. My starter was the goats cheese salad which was really nice, followed by Lamb. I found the Lamb perfect in every way and I really recommend it. During our dining experience we had the most amazing sunset which illuminated the whole restaurant, this was quite magical.I really love this place as it's stylish without being pretentious, has superb views and is like dining in the clouds. The food here is excellent and I had no trouble booking a table. My only slight criticism is the gents bathroom isn't easy to find, but it's such a minor thing that it won't affected my rating.",

That's fine, I figured that we were really paying for the view so I came in with low expectations. Sadly, it was worse than I even expected. The table we were given was off to the side with mediocre views due to the Shard building obstructing the views. The place wasn't full so they could have given a bit of a better table. They mention you need to let them know about any dietary restrictions ahead of time. My mom was vegetarian and my dietary was noted and confirmed days before we arrived. On arrival, we were asked a number of times if we had any dietary restrictions. We then proceeded to wait almost a full hour for our afternoon tea sandwiches and pastries to be served. They also gave my mom only three sandwiches instead of the standard four - huh? She's paying the same price for a cheaper tea and they can't even give her four sandwiches? All the bites were incredibly bland, dry and forgettable. Service was almost nonexistent and we had to consistently try to catch someone for refills on tea, to get the bill, etc. For the price, I would go anywhere else in the city for afternoon tea. Should have just stuck to Fortnum and Mason or the Ritz! The view isn't worth the price and mediocre afternoon tea. Definitely will not be back for the tea...",

Given we'd just woken up and came straight there a full 3 course lunch didn't feel right. As it turned out the table across from us was also not aware of this. We asked our Italian waiter if we could just order a la carte. He seemed enormously inconvenienced by us asking questions, and said no, it was mandatory, but the manager said we could order just a main for \u00a324. Minimum 1 x main course per person. We decided to leave, it all seemed a bit silly! We popped by the reception desk and let them know that a fixed price is fine, but you need to make diners aware of that. None of the staff had a particularly gracious manner when dealing with complaints and seemed to believe this was just the norm.

The front of house staff were really nice, the only issue we had was with someone in the restaurant. We were seated back from the windows but there were window seats free. When I asked if we could sit at the window I was told these were reserved for other people who were just coming. They never came. \u00a0Eventually he agreed to move us but reluctantly I must add. We were there first, \u00a0I don't see the problem! The view is undoubtedly amazing and the food was really nice too - we both had fry ups. Also had some breakfast cocktails which were yummy! The setting and food made it very special, just that issue with the table that let them down.",

    "text": "If you're going to the Shard, skip Aqua Shard and go to Hutong instead. The view is not worth the headache. My parents and boyfriend were recently visiting from Boston / New York City and after a week of great dinners at various places around London, I brought them to Aqua Shard on their last night here, thinking it would be a nice British-style twist on Hutong (the restaurant one floor up, which I frequent and like very much). Boy, was I wrong! The view is fantastic, but that's about it! To start off, I had made reservations about a month in advance for a table at 6:30pm on a Sunday because everything else was apparently booked. When we got there, there were tables empty for hours (with nicer views) but they stuck us at the back of the restaurant, which seemed very odd to me as the other tables did not fill up while we were there. The waiter was very unfriendly from the start, and every time we asked another waiter / waitress to help, they pretty much ignored us. We ordered appetizers and drinks to start (cocktails, followed by wine for the main course). The appetizers were fine (hence the 1 star), but the drinks all came out after we had finished (our wine did not even come out until we had finished our main meals) and we had to continuously ask for simple things like an extra fork, bread plates, olive oil for bread (I think we asked about 4 times for this)... it was like nothing was coordinated and the server would bring one thing at a time (like one glass of water, or one napkin, rather than servicing the whole table at one time... others might need water / napkins as well!...). We didn't really complain to much upfront and just rolled our eyes as we continuously had to ask for things. It was my parents' final night in the city and we just wanted to enjoy the food/view, and not be frustrated. When our main entrees came out, that's when I absolutely lost it. I had ordered Dover Sole which was about the size of my finger (and had bones in it, which took up half of the size) with a side of three (3) very small gnocchi. I'm a small girl, and wasn't expecting a huge plate, but paying \u00a333 for that is utterly embarrassing. I tasted it, hoping it would be the best fish I ever had, but it was cold and dry! Everyone else's dishes at the table were equally appalling. When we called the waiter and the manager over to the table, the waiter didn't really seem to care, and the manager couldn't really do anything to fix our over \u00a3200 bill. He acknowledged that there were issues with the coordination and apologized for the table location (which, to be honest, was the least of our worries). No one came after that for a long time and we just sat there waiting for our bill for about 20 minutes (there was no way we were ordering dessert or champagne, as we had planned to do). It was really a shame that this happened to be the restaurant I chose for my parents' last night in the city, because it was a special night and I was really expecting more. I will not return to this restaurant (but will continue to frequent Hutong) and encourage others to not go to Aqua Shard either.",

Food was erring close to Haute Cuisine which i don't like, however a starter and main proved a good amount of food. Everything we had was amazing. The wine i chose was a let down, but being a viticulture philistine i cant hardly complain about that. A West facing table could have been the only improvement to watch the sunset...Meal ran us 145 for the two, and all things considered this was good value i thought.

Prices are what you would expect from a fine dining establishment in downtown London in the tallest building in European Union.I'd have to say we were quite amused that when we both requested a side of potatoes they had run out. Seriously, a British restaurant that runs out of potatoes? I'd think there'd be a law against that!Otherwise very good.PS The loos also offer an amazing and breathtaking view. Spectacular!",

It was no more than 1 minute before a waiter quickly took it away from the table.The drink was clearly full! Yet- the waiter took the drink. My friends did not even see him swoop in because it happened so quickly. I complained to the bar as just having spent 16\u00a3 on a cocktail - and they made me a new one but this took an additional 30 minutes of me waiting at the bar as had such a long queue. Please be more aware of your customers & do not just take drinks away that are full when it is in the middle of a table surrounded by 6 people. It is quite cruel considering the entire ordeal took me 75 minutes to sample 1 drink. I feel as though more could have been done by management to bring a new one to my table instead of making me wait at the bar an additional 30 minutes for my 1st drink. View & drinks were good but with poor service.",

    "text": "I visited Aqua Shard for NYE dinner. I think it would be a great 4 star restaurant normally, but it gets docked 2 stars because of the weirdness of NYE the night I went. First, the Shard is an icon in London, as it is the tallest building. It is also very accessible using the underground transportation. It's views attract tourists and locals alike, and it is located in a very hustle/bustle area. We tried to book reservations in the bar area in September, but it was already filled up and now I know why. We therefore reserved a table for dinner, looking over the London eye side of the tower. Although we paid much more for these prime views of the fireworks, hoards of people ran over from the bar side of the restaurant to block our views of the fireworks. They used our chairs as stepping stools to see over the crowd and our table as theirs to rest their glasses :/ it wasn't the most pleasant NYE celebration to say the least. Book the bar side of the restaurant for NYE, then run over to ruin the views of the guests dining there. But don't go for dinner expecting to have a relaxing, comfortable view of the fireworks. The dinner itself was great. I enjoyed the lobster and steak, as well as the \"complimentary\" cheese platter after dessert. The service was ok... Nothing special, in fact I think we would have ordered more drinks if they were more observant/checked on us more. It was a little weird that they had to check who were like 4 times that night: first, at the entrance of the hotel, second, at the entrance to Aqua shard, third at the bottom of the stairs of Aqua shard, fourth at the table. With so many staff members milling around, you'd think they'd be more organized.Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back. The company I was with made my night, not necessarily the views, awkwardness or uncomfortableness of watching fireworks smashed up against the window with 100 other people.",

Drinks are very pricey, so I recommend going with something on the rocks if that kind of thing floats your boat. Hard to find a seat, but if you scope it out long enough someone is bound to get up. Go there for one drink, enjoy the view, and then meander elsewhere. Biggest regret: not going to the bathroom at the Shard. Supposed to be one of the best toilet views in the world. Make sure to go to the loo!",

However, it's clear that the same issues we had first time around are still clearly there. It's also way over priced for what you get. I understand that it is a high end tourist spot. Free entry to see the view of London 31 stories up. So they probably get a lot of tourist not wanting to spend money but wanting to check out the view. I also understand that the staff will get a lot of people who don't speak a lot of English or who don't know the English tipping system or who don't know what other facilities are near by. They are also probably used to people moving around to get seats with better view of London. I also \u00a0realise these repetitive situations will make their responses seem short and blunt. I was, however with a group of English people. I also work in London Bridge. We asked simple questions and got no response in reply. The staff were, the majority of the time, down right rude. For example the bill says a discretionary tip can be added but the waiter forced us to add the tip. Oh and finally you can't make large reservations here either at the bar. The Walkie Talkies roof Gardens is free and the staff are much more pleasant. Go there.",

    "text": "What can I say about Aqua Shard? We had won a gift certificate to use there and were excited - then we read all the reviews. I'll cut the story short - generally the service is as bad as you've read elsewhere. \u00a0So we arrived a couple of minutes to six, as that was when the reservation was for. We had our coats checked and were told to sit and wait. Some time ticked by and others who were newly arriving we're being taken to their tables. So we got up and asked to be seated again, only to be told to sit back down. Another ten minutes and finally we got seated in the actual restaurant. There was some excuse about the chef cooking a new dish - well that didn't make any difference to us reading the menu and ordering drinks actually in the restaurant.We were given a couple of cocktails to compensate for the delay, and we did get a window seat. But the lighting and the table setup were odd. Basically you have a spotlight on the middle of the table - meaning that whatever it is that your eating is in perpetual gloom. Plus you have to sit next to and not opposite the other person. But of course the view is the thing.Despite it being free, we decided to opt against any of the starters and went straight to mains. I had the lamb saddle, while the missus had the lentil gnocchi. We finally got our mains and technically our first course some fifty minutes after being seated. The gnocchi was hilariously small and could have passed for a started. Mine was a little bigger but although the majority of mine was good - the mouthful I got with the lemon gel unexpectedly was horrible. But at least it eliminated that gel in one mouthful and I enjoyed the rest.For desert I had the restaurants version of an Eton mess, while the missus had the peanut jelly. Both were good, but again hers was tiny. Admittedly the service did turn up when we needed them, but it always took a while. No one came to check if everything was ok, and the servers were stern to say the least. I'm simply glad we didn't have to pay anything for the experience. I know they must want a michelin star for here, but while the location suits, the service doesn't come close and the food tries entirely too hard.",

    "text": "While in London, under the recommendation of our local relatives and online reviews, my husband and I went to Aqua Shard in London's iconic building for an afternoon tea with a view. While waiting for our table to be ready, we waited at the bar area and ordered ourselves some cocktail. I got the Passion Fruit Brulee. It is by far the best cocktail I have ever had. The caramelized creme brulee foam is light, fluffy and just heavenly. Although this is a fruity cocktail the drink was not too sweet. You definitely taste the tartness of the passion fruit. We got seated by the window almost immediately after getting our drinks. Even on a misty day, the view from the Shard was absolutely amazing. Once seated, we were given a choice of tea, I naturally decided to go for the English Breakfast (being in England and all). The tea was good but nothing extraordinary (I think I was too busy sipping on my cocktail and champagne). The sandwiches were by far the best I have ever eaten. It was so hard to resist licking my fingers and plate. I liked the finger sandwiches so much that I was tempted to almost pay for another round of champagne and afternoon tea just so I could have more of those sandwiches. The scones and cakes were equally good. Out waitress was very friendly and attentive. Despite the high price tag I would have given this place 5 stars and highly recommended this place to everyone. Until..just when we were getting ready to pay our bill the fire alarm started to go off in the building. I do no blame the restaurant or the building for the alarm because these kind of things happen. They even did a good job evacuating everyone in a timely manner. After waiting in the rain for almost an hour we were finally allowed to go back in. We could have decided to leave like some of the other diners rather than just wasting out time waiting but we still had our coats and umbrellas checked into the coat closet upstairs. When my husband went to pick up the belongings I went to pay for our bills. I was shocked that a place of this caliber would make me pay the full amount! I know the fire alarm was not their fault but you should give some incentives to your customers for the inconvenience so they can rave about your place and even become a returning customer. Chucking it out to maybe that is something they would only do in the states I continued to wait for my husband. In the 5 minutes it took for him to come back with our belonging at least 3 staff members asked me if I paid my bills yet. The next day I got a call from a woman who claimed that she was the manager apologizing for the inconvenience. I thought maybe they had called to offer more than apologies. Couple of minutes into the conversation I realized that the woman was trying to figure out if I had the bills without just coming out straight and just asking me. Once I told her, \"Oh yes we paid before we left.\" She just said, \"Oh OK we just wanted to make sure managed to pay.\" and hung up! Again thinking maybe this is the British way I ignored it. A few days later I told this to a group of locals over dinner what had happened and they were all appalled. I really hope they handle situations like this better in the future. You don't even have to give discount but do not start chasing people for every penny. Despite the \"fire alarm\" situation if given the chance I still recommend this place for the amazing cocktail, sandwiches and dessert.",

Like other reviewers, I was put off by the multiple layers of security and bouncers - they are definitely trying to keep the riffraff out, which always makes me fear they'll just look at me and say \"nope.\" But they let us in and seated us at a table with a lovely view (not window, but close).We were prepared to spend an obscene amount of money for \"brunch,\" which we did. The wine selection was excellent, the three-course prix fixe was delicious, and we enjoyed the view, the sunset and all the lights in the city coming on. It's a great splurge for a visit to London.",

We came here for drinks on a Saturday without reservation and were blessed with a table within 5 minutes close to the window. Another party of two who bought their drinks at the bar tried to steal our table but luckily the server sort of ignored them. Drinks are definitely on the pricey side but you get what you pay for in terms of the experience, atmosphere and view. A side note is that I find that the setup is quite similar to the Aqua in Hong Kong! :)",

    "text": "I absolutely loved my experience at the Aqua Shard. My fianc\u00e9 and I had brunch. I had a non-alcoholic passion fruit mojito which was delicious and very beautiful. The decor and atmosphere at the Aqua Shard was breath-taking and very lavish. There were extremely high ceilings and clear windows everywhere so you couldn't escape the city view of London. It's very important to make a reservation or else you won't get a table. The service was okay. The food took ages to come out. The food was very tasty. It was very beautifully decorated and high quality, but it was extremely overpriced. The prices were a bit insane. Honesty. I'm not one to complain about prices at a restaurant but it was a bit over the top for what it was. The prices were a bit insane. I had dinner at an amazing Michelin star restaurant for a cheaper price so it's a bit insane. But I think their brunch menu was also lacking a lot of originality and uniqueness. It was very basic. I didn't really like it. The tiny portions, the price and the basic menu...come on. I'm sure that they could do a lot better.",

This set includes juice, tea or coffee, a selection of pastries, and entree - I went for the classic orange juice, coffee, and Severn & Wye Smoked Salmon. We were given a mix of all different pastries to share (pain Au chocolat, croissant, blueberry muffin, white and raspberry muffin), which we enjoyed with our juice and coffee. Each pastry tasted amazing, but pain au chocolat and blueberry muffin were my favorites. I was already full by this point and although the entree took a while to come out, we used the waiting time to take pictures - the view is absolutely spectacular. When my smoked salmon came out, I was immediately impressed by the display - everything looked so beautiful. Also, the various spreads I was given fit so well with the salmon and the bread. My friend got the Shard Full English breakfast - she enjoyed hers as well, but it was too much for one person to eat. If you want something lighter, I would suggest the salmon, although I left feeling extremely full! Overall, highly recommend!",

It was a crab salad and was not very appetizing.For entrees we ordered the fish and the lamb. The lamb was pretty good but I heard from my fiancee that the fish was not too flavorful. \u00a0All entrees are presented well but not the best flavor.For dessert we had the cheesecake that was a deconstructed version. Idk it just didn't work either.Overall service was outstanding.I would definitely come for a drink at the bar and eat somewhere else.",

The food was okay, the vibe and the views were amazing, but the waiters were really bad and unprofessional.- They started with bringing me the wrong whiskey.- We shared 1 starter, 1 main and 1 dessert. It took them 20 min for the started, more than 1 hour for the main and another 40 minutes for the dessert.- It is unacceptable to wait 40 minutes for a really bad dessert. We order the chocolate cake, which we didn't even finish since it was worst than a \u00a31 cake.- I had to ask for the bill 3 times for them to bring me the bill. We got there at 8:50 and we left at 11:30. We ran out of drinks very fast and we basically waited for hours looking on the window and talking about how bad the service is.- The waiter was really unprofessional. His english and manners were really bad. We would never use full sentences he would come and say on an aggressive tone \"FINISH\"? In the end, I paid \u00a3230 for a bad experience. It is sad to see how such a great location is waisted by hiring unprofessional staff and serving average food at a premium price.",

Due to a change of schedule we were around the Shard earlier so I called to see if there is any table available. Aqua Shard picked up and told us \"yes - please come at 12ish we have a table for you.\"Showed up at 12:15pm, directly got shut into the corner of the bar to \"wait for the table\". Waited for an hour, seeing people (even walk-ins I suspect) got their tables, with about 10 tables still empty. So we went up and asked if we can be seated yet. A very rude staff responded \"your booking is 1:30pm. So no.\"Here I must highlight the fact that, all the people got seated before us were white people. At 1:30pm we went up to check for our table again. The same very rude staff did not even answer us - just waved his Asian colleague over to \"deal with us\". His staff told us \"oh yeah it's very busy here, our afternoon tea only starts at 1pm. That's why you had to wait.\"Wait. Our booking was for brunch - which should have begun at 10:30am. So they have messed up our booking from the very beginning, and made us waited for an hour for nothing. No apologies whatsoever from this crew. I never write about any dining experience nor complain about things online - but this restaurant certainly deserves my first and last.",

At first I didn't say anything, until I noticed three couples who came in after me being seated by the windows. That's when I became upset! When the waiter came to take our order I asked, \"is it possible to get a window seat?\" He replied in his charming French accent, \"Anything is possible.\"Within five minutes we were moved to the best window seat in the house!

I ordered the Lobster Benedict and Braised Welsh hogget (which is almost like lamb but a bit older). The former was light on lobster and tasted okay. With the latter, the meat wasn't very tender or flavorful. The potatoes, which were slightly fried on the outside, were on the dry side. There was also some form of mint pur\u00e9e which didn't make sense to me and too strong. I drenched the meal in gravy sauce, which helped. Given the price (48 euros per person), this meal didn't meet my expectations. I recommend dropping by for a drink at the bar instead to catch the view.",

I ordered the scallops and bubble and squeak (duck egg over a potato mixture and a bit of truffle). The scallops were beautiful but not comparable in taste to the cauliflower soup some others ordered at our table. The bubble and squeak was really very good but overpriced for what it is - egg and potato (even with duck egg prices at what they are lol). For dessert, we ordered the hazelnut one and it was really delicious! Overall, we enjoyed the ambience and the company, but a few flaws stopped me from giving all 5 stars.

    "text": "I attempted to make a booking for Aqua Shard and instead of the date and time I wanted, an error occurred the website made me a reservation for a time that had already passed. I immediately contacted the restaurant to correct the error and received a confirmation booking for the date I initially wanted. Six days before the booking, I could no longer make it and contacted the restaurant to cancel. The policy on their website states that you will be charged if you do not provide 24 hours' notice for cancellation. However, the reservation manager said that I would be charged even though I was canceling well in advance of 24 hours because I had already made one change to the booking. When I explained that I did not agree with being charged because the policy does not state that you cannot make more than one change to the booking and that my booking was only changed the first time because the website allowed me to make a booking for a time/date that had already passed, I was told that the process is automated and my only other option would be to reschedule. When I asked to speak to another manager because I was dissatisfied with what was going on, I was told via email that \"Your claims have been discussed extensively, as per the exchange of emails. I am the designated manager to review all booking enquiries, and I will now consider this matter closed, as I have completed your request ( with the alternative options offered to you, declined ).\" \u00a0In response to this email I asked for clarification as to whether the restaurant intended to charge my card or whether they were complying with my request to cancel the reservation without any charges, as I canceled more than 24 hours in advance.My email was ignored, my reservation was canceled, and my card was charged \u00a375 WITHOUT MY AGREEMENT, and more than 24 hours before the date/time of my reservation. Customer service was terrible, they go against their written polices, and have fraudulent practices. Beware before making any bookings with them.Here is the booking fee policy on their website for your reference:Booking Policy: Please note that for all bar reservations there is a \u00a330 minimum spend per person. We kindly require at least 24 hours' notice to cancel the reservation, otherwise, authorisation is given to Aqua Brit LTD, to charge a \u00a330 per person cancellation fee to the credit card taken to confirm this booking. Due to the high volume of requests, we are unable to guarantee window tables, or any requests for a particular table. If you are running more than 20 minutes late for your reservation, your booking may not be honoured and we reserve the right to cancel the reservation if the original guest numbers are reduced by more than half. Aqua Brit Ltd may cancel a booking prior to the event without any liability being incurred whatsoever if aqua shard or The Shard is closed due to any events and circumstances beyond its control. Our dress code is Smart casual (no sports kit, shorts or flip-flops). As we are located in The Shard, please kindly be advised that all guests and their personal belongings entering the building will be subject to security screenings. Suitcases are not permitted. All guests must be over 18 years of age. Please note that you may be asked to present photo I.D. if you look under 25 years of age.",

    "text": "This review is for the bar area only. Stopped by Aqua Shard for a late afternoon cocktail while traipsing about London. Honestly, though the view is indeed impeccable, the experience fell short of expectations for a luxury property.Don't expect a seamless arrival; first, one must proceed through a security check (with metal detector) at the ground level, before taking a dedicated elevator to the bar/restaurant area. Can't fault the security, however.Although there are some tables in the bar area, it is still unclear to me how one goes about procuring one. We were told both that they are first come, first served and then told they are reserved. The bar area was completely packed, even at 3pm, which meant finding a space was a tad challenging. Trying to get a seat involves swooping in abruptly. What was annoying was the number of spots taken up by those ordering few or low value items, lingering indefinitely, and/or loitering about when finished. There should really be more tables allocated to the bar area, a portion of which could be reserved in advance with table minimum spend amount.Once we did find a standing space at the bar, we ordered a Bellini (\u00a315) and Belvedere Martini (\u00a315.25) from a friendly and efficient bartender. The drinks themselves were good, and the view is incredible, even on a rainy day. However, we decided to leave after just one, as we grew weary of the whole thing.Leaving three stars mainly for the view and good bartender, without which it would probably be two.",

    "text": "This review is for the bar, and whether you want to be here for the bar or the restaurant, it's difficult to get in unless you have a reservation. I was turned away as a walk-in on a Saturday night, but made it in early in the afternoon the next day. Once you get in, you can understand why gaining entrance is so tough to begin with. The wrap-around bar \"island\" is actually rather small and, in addition to fitting 3-4 bartenders inside, fits maybe 30-40 people all around it before they start bleeding into the restaurant and imposing on diners' space. Indeed, most folks at the bar will be tourists angling for great Instagram and Facebook shots like, ahem, yours truly. As for the cocktails at the bar, they're going to be quite pricey by U.S. standards, but not so much by inner London standards, especially given the premium setting. They're all quite well-crafted, and despite the hordes of tourists descending on the bar photographing or videoing their every move, the bartenders keep quite good composure in sparing no effort towards a quality, detailed drink. In my case, I was even comped a drink by a bartender because he had to substitute a critical ingredient for another, so I was more than happy to down an extra drink on top of it.And let's not forget the real reason why folks clamor to come here. It's all about the setting. Not only does the Shard command outsized attention as a newly jarring feature of the London skyline visible for miles, but given the the bar's location high up the structure, the panoramic views - from Parliament and the London Eye to the west (most visible from the restaurant side of the floor) to the City of London and its newish skyscrapers like the Gherkin and the Walkie-Talkie directly to the north (in front the bar) and Canary Wharf towards the east (most visible from the bar). Sipping some fantastically crafted cocktails high atop London with a jaw-dropping view of the surrounding skyline? Simply one of the most amazing experiences in this little planet of ours.",

While The Shard is quite tall the restaurant is only on the 31st floor which gives you a similar view as you would get across the river at Sky Garden. Service wasn't very good either during our visit. The food was decent but not anything special. The black pudding and salmon were my favorite savories but pretty pedestrian. The lobster wasn't bad but it was 90% bread with an almost imperceptible amount of filling. The scones we had all tasted the same, from the waiter's description it almost sounded like half were plain and half gluten free. The sweets were pretty good but couldn't save this tea alone. Overall it was quite underwhelming. On my last trip I had tea at Fortnum and Mason which was around the same cost and significantly more enjoyable. I also went over to Sky Garden and got a similar view, a coffee, and a pastry for \u00a34. I really can't see any reason I would return to Aqua Shard",

The three of us arrived around 5:30 and were able to find a table within about 10 minutes. The waitstaff here are very attentive & we placed our drink orders. Because \"when in London\" I had to order a pimms cup- which was absolutely refreshing & delicious. Note that the drinks here are very \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 - but the views are fantastic! Definitely worth it to have one fancy drink here with friends and enjoy the beautiful view of London.",

The tea and sweets were great, but the savory food was less impressive. Our servers were polite and prompt. It is the overall experience and value that earns Aqua Shard a high star review, not necessarily the quality of the food. Reservations seem to be necessary and I would suggest dressing up a little. I think I would have felt out of place had I been dressed casually.",

However, you are coming here for the view of London which is far more cost efficient than paying to go to the observatory and getting no food. The staff is super friendly and one waiter even offered to take our picture at all the best spots around the restaurant so we could get the major city landscapes in the background.Be sure to make reservations here and dress up if you come here for dinner!",

However, when we got there we realized we were underdressed, but they let us sit at a table and order drinks anyways. Because of our casual attire, the waitress didn't treat us very friendly or patiently, which definitely put a damper on the experience. She didn't really recommend drinks when we asked her to, either. The drinks we got did end up tasting pretty good and they were very aesthetically pleasing. But the waitress brought our check before we'd even finished our drinks and it seemed like she was trying to get us to leave. We were there around dinner time but it wasn't super crowded so I thought she was being a little rude and pushy. My mom and I took some pictures but the lighting wasn't that great. Overall, it was kind of a disappointing experience even though I still enjoyed the time with my mom.",

As a foodie from San Francisco, I am hyped up for the experience, but we wanted to walk out of the restaurant when drinks took over half an hour to get and we didn't get our dinner until 2 hours later. We also sent our dinner back and walked out because all the dishes were cold. Also, one of their floor managers was so rude to one of our dinner members. Don't waste your time and money coming here. OXO, on the other hand, is an excellent choice for an incredible dining experience with London view. Though the management team at Shard offered an invitation to come back, we politely declined since we couldn't possibly subject ourselves to less than average food and service.Aqua Shard - you are a huge disappointment and embarrassment of a fine dining establishment! Need to learn from OXO and other restaurants in San Francisco!",

The weather has been so beautiful that I thought it would be a good time to visit Aqua Shard. I had called to see if they could seat a single cover - they were completely booked. I decided to walk in and try my luck. When I arrived, after visiting the observatory area of the Shard, I was seated pretty immediately. Everyone was really kind and I was served quickly. The only problem was a little too quickly - My fish was completely raw. The manager offered to take the fish off my bill. Another manager looking person offered me a glass of champagne on the house. After that the service started to slip. They took away my napkin from me and never returned a fresh one. A waitress dropped a dirty knife on my shoe - and it took a while to get the check. Even with those things, I still think all in all it was pretty excellent service. I was actually going to give extra tip - but there was no place to do so. The food on the other hand - I might have ordered different things next time. I would give this restaurant another chance.",

We were seated facing the floor-to-ceiling window and the atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice. Even the bathrooms had gorgeous views, I didn't want to come out of the bathroom because of the floor-to-ceiling windows and mirrors everywhere, amazing effect. For views, I give 5 stars.Overall, however, given that we paid about $300 for dinner (husband and I) including a bottle of wine, I am disappointed with the quality of the meal. Seems like the dishes were not taste tested at all. We are not picky eaters but couldn't enjoy what was presented. Dessert was the only acceptable course. Bottom line, if you'd like an experience in the tallest building in the EU, you may try here, or the other 2 restaurants up here, but don't expect much of a meal at the Aquashard, in my opinion.",

So I decided to go to one of the Shard's restaurants to enjoy the view while eating. I booked more than a week in advance and a table for 3 at 22.15 on friday was the only option I could get over the entire bank holiday weekend!The place is quite dark, but it is well decorated not to overshadow the view and the low lighting is perfect to enjoy the City lighting. Table are well distantiated and the service is dicrete and polite.Speaking of the food, it claims to be a British restaurant, so I developed low expectations...instead it was really good. I had the salmon starter that was really tender and tasty and a pork main, that was really really good. My parent's food also was nice, beef starters and ribeyes, all well cooked and beautifully presented. Good wine list, quite comprehensive in terms of styles and price range. there is a big area dedicated to the american bar and it is nothing like the aqua kyoto one (loud, full of people and music), this one is really cozy and relaxed, feels a bit like a retro place or a very posh hotel bar...I'll try it soon!",

We didn't eat so this review is just for drinks at the bar.You cant make reservations for drinks bookings, and although it was busy (Thursday evening) there was space to stand and admire the view. I'd say chances of getting a table are pretty slim unless you get there early or happen to be hovering nearby as someone else leaves. Bar staff were a bit thin on the ground, so by the time I got served I decided it would be quicker to forgo the cocktails and order wine.Drinks are a little on the pricey side but it's all about the location so that's to be expected. It's not somewhere that I'd go often, but it's good for peeping out at the the skyline of London or for showing off the city to out-of-towners.",

The fish would be refunded but not the side veggies that were requested to replace the fish (as NO ONE wanted to wait for a new entree). Entrees all appeared minutes apart so we sat being polite while our food got cold waiting.. They offered us complimentary dessert which seemed like they were trying until it appeared on our bill. We would have never ordered dessert had it not been free. When the bill came the waiter again apologized and acted as though he pulled strings to get 20% of the bill - which was greater than the price of the fish that wasn't cooked. The next person that picked up the bill told us the same story but only that the desserts which were free were the 20%.. Does anyone else understand how this math could possible work? Save yourself..have a drink, use the loo and go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Disclaimer, I'm only reviewing the bar here.Nothing exciting often happens on a Tuesday. Unless you live with a budding actress that is who recently got accepted into a very prestigious drama school. Of course celebrations had to be had. And I had to think on my feet for this one because I had no idea she would get told she was in that day. So I gave her 15 minutes to change, booked an Uber cab (love this firm, much better than Addison Lee) and whisked her off to the shard. \u00a031 floors up in a polished wood elevator we emerged on the restaurant deck and wandered into Aquashard for celebration drinks.No reservations for the bar, so we perched and then quickly grabbed a table by the window. This wasn't actually that difficult, I suppose it was 10pm Tuesday in a glass building, so naturally there are a lot of windows. I will say this though, the view is INCREDIBLE. As someone who hasn't been to the top of the Shard (overpriced much?) I was a little bit in awe of how beautiful London is lit up at night from this height. It helped that it was a clear night too, but even if it wasn't we didn't pay in advance for this view. The cocktail price does however reflect the location, starting at \u00a313. Now they were nice cocktails don't get me wrong, but at that price I could name 3 nicer bars just off the top of my head. The bartenders were also very knowledgeable, helping you to choos. They did however take their sweet time; at one point I had to shout at one to let me pay, having poured me the drinks and wandered off. I know, I'm just so responsible.All in all though, we decided that this would be our career milestone celebratory cocktail bar. My turn next... Right?!",

One floor down from your warm greeting, the Aqua Shard itself offers stunning views overlooking The City of London to the north, Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf to the east and the BT Tower toward the West. The lunchtime set menu offers some interesting dishes and is good value for money given the location. My recommendations would be the smoked salmon followed by the pork. There is a large seating area and bar which I would imagine is crowded in the evenings. In summary, good food, good value, great views. Only miss was the service which fell a little short of expectations.",

    "text": "Our meal at Aqua shard was \"ok\". If the food and service was as good as the bathroom (a must see - I'll leave the details as a surprise) and view I would have given this restaurant a 5/5. However, the service seemed to be equivalent to a moderate chain restaurant and the food overpriced and prepared with little effort. I have had many goat cheese salads in my experience and this starter here was disappointing. It was a pile of lettuce with a few \"drops\" of goat cheese splattered around the plate. The appearance was a let down, as was the dish. I've never felt more strongly that this was a \"money generator\" dish. It probably cost a tenth of what they charged for it. I've made better at home. Enough with the rant about the salad...The service was lacklustre and I felt as if he staff was just there to take our order and give us our food. Silverware was misplaced for particular dishes, crumbs were left on the table and there was no effort to go \"above and beyond\" to make our dinner special. Picky detail - we were served red wine in white wine glasses while the table next to us was given red wine I. Red wine glasses.Let down- 2/4 of my party ordered the pork belly only to be told afterwards they were \"out\". The menu was very small to begin with and this should have been pointed out ahead of time or removed from the menu. Even better don't run out of pork belly. On a positive note, we were given a table with a great view upon request on line.MAIN TAKEAWAYGo to aqua shard bar and order a bottle of the cheapest wine (all are good quality and delicious). Enjoy the view and then go have some food at a better restaurant (or Burrough market right down the street).",

Maybe this is the thing they are going for, in which case they should raise their prices to match. The food quality was mediocre.

We were also fortunate that another group were just finishing and were kind enough to let us know and offer us their seats before anyone else snagged them.The setting is really quite spectacular and it feels very decadent walking down the steps and looking into the glittering sea of sparkling lights reflected in the floor to ceiling windows and out over the river view (which probably accounts for the premium you're paying on the drinks!).It feels like a great place to start a night out, so I'll certainly return, and the venue is sure to impress if you've got friends visiting from out of town.",

The views over London where stunning, I could see Primrose Hill from where I was sat. There was even the novelty factor of the urinals looking out over London, a very scenic toilet experience. The food solid but nothing special. For starters I had goats cheese and tomato salad. For mains roast chicken and vegetables and desert I had the coffee and chocolate moose. All courses came from the set menu which was \u00a328 per head which considering the location is pretty reasonable.

The views are stunning, so no need to gush any further about that however, the environment, food and service were equally lovely.We had a few different selections from the brunch menu and none disappointed in flavour. My friend did have to ask for hot sauce for her oysters - not sure why there was no cup given with this order along with a vinagrette. Oh well. No issue.The complimentary cocktail is a nice touch and considering how hot it was outside it was quite refreshing as was the air conditioning. Side note, can London please get out of the dark ages with the no air-con in your venues please? Rant over.Our servers were prompt and non-intrusive. They assisted a couple in my party with some drink choices too. Reservations are a must and they turn tables at Aqua Shard but we were not rushed to vacate.Yes, this is all about the views and they have added an ample amount of mirrors inside and the bathrooms to give the illusion of even more space but it does work. In fact, we liked the mirror clad bathroom-haha!The prices are not for the faint hearted but we could not fault the food. I would not pay the price again but I can say, we did not need to eat for the rest of the day because it was substantial and tasty.We then went to the bar area for more drinks. This area is smaller, err, cramped by the windows for the obvious reason. I did not like that so much but we were seated and enjoying our time here. The other things I found unsettling, kids and grubby wear from a few patrons. This is not your local boozer so leave your kids at home along with your tatty trainers,mingin' jeans and logo tee'sOverall, Aqua Shard was really very good and a special venue for our special event.",

Ordered the short rib, which was highly recommended because the mayonnaise sauce was \"extremely addictive and highly rated\". It was cooked well, very tender but had no flavor. Left half of it uneaten. Not worth the 700\u00a3 spent. Drinks are their specialty, but considering that I asked for a round of lychee shots they didnt have, so i told him to tell the bartender to get creative something fruity with vodka, and he responds with \"the bartender is busy and doesnt have time for games, but he recommends coffee patron\" which is nothing near what I asked.

    "text": "The perfect place if you don't want to see or hear the person(s) you are dining with. \u00a0Staff is unfriendly, lack knowledge of limited, uninteresting menu, seemed overwhelmed with volume (on a Sunday evening), in no rush to take additional drink order when asked, or provide a bill. \u00a0After 25 minutes with the bill ready to pay, I eventually checked out at the bar with the assistance of my i-phone flash light to get me there.Be warned they have stiff penalties for not only cancelling a reservation, but also for changing the time or the number of people in your party. \u00a0Think you can just have a drink to take the view, be ready for a significant minimum food order...A better choice with equivalent view, but with excellent service and menu is Sushi Samba nearby.",

    "text": "Had a drink here a couple of weeks ago. They were very accommodating of our group of 4 plus 2yr old and even provided a babyccino on request which was appreciated. The cheapest wine - \u00a344 a bottle - was delicious and the atmosphere nice, a mix of tourists and posh people. It was really expensive, but then it is half way up the shard. The service was so friendly, and we were made to feel so welcome (despite us being in sandals and rain coats etc) that I would come again... after payday!",

We had reserved for 9am but turned up a little early and so were lucky enough to get a seat right at the window. The views are stunning, well worth a visit for that alone. The breakfast menu has lots of choice, so you really don't \u00a0need to spend a fortune. Prices are on the high side, but coffee and toast wouldn't break the bank. We opted for something a bit more lavish- the eggs Benedict were just fabulous. Service was prompt, if not speedy- we did get the feeling that they weren't encouraging us to linger. We decided to order a second cafetiere of coffee so we could enjoy the view a bit longer. When it didn't arrive after quite some time, we asked about it- only a couple of minutes later it arrived, and we were told it was on the house since we'd been waiting so long- bonus! I think a window seat definitely enhances the experience; you can see the view from pretty much any seat in the place, but it's best from nearest the windows. Unfortunately I don't think you can guarantee this when you book; you just have to take your chance on he day. My advice would be to show up a bit early for your booking. Would definitely recommend as an experience to try- and the food's pretty good too!",
