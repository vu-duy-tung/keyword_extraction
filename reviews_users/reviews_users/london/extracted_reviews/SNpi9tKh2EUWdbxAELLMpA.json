Also, when I went, on a Friday night the sitting area was closed. So it was take away only. I didn't ask why, but maybe call first if you want to sit down.",

It looked nice and they have an emphasis on sustainable fishing - which is great.We ordered the chicken pie and small cod. The pie was clearly made, not bought and was almost perfect. The pastry wasn't overwhelming and the pie had a nice mushroom and chicken taste. My only comment would be that there needs to be more chicken bits.The cod was nice and was cooked just right rather than too long. The small size is quite generous so many might find it suitable for a lunch rather than being tempted to order a larger one.The chips, are perhaps the best thing about this place. Perfectly cooked so they are crispy but not greasy. They tasted great!! Wish I could eat chips like this more often.",

The hostess noticed and took our order. Our meal took an extremely long time to be served. So long, a couple that was seated 15-20 mins after us received their meal at the same time. I mentioned this to the manager and he offered to comp our appetizer and give us a free dessert. That was wonderful, but the service continued on its downward slide. I'll take excellent service over FREE food any day! We finished our meal and our server did not come to clear our table and offer a dessert menu for some time. She finally made her way to our table cleared it and a short while later the manager came and took our dessert order. We ate our dessert and sat around waiting again for the check. I placed my credit card on the table as a hint I was ready to pay and still no sign of our server. I finally made eye contact with her and she dropped the bill on the table and walked away(I honestly wanted to cry at this point) I waited a while then walked to the hostess and paid my bill.This was a very frustrating and unfulfilling dining experience. I will never return nor recommend this place. I'm not sure what the disconnect was between my server of whom I did not know her name or that she was indeed my server until I was leaving the restaurant was. \u00a0But she was HORRIBLE to my mom and I and does not deserve to work in the service industry!",

So decided not to venture far...and ever since then i've been a total fan and this is where i take all my friends. It's not cheap...but the quality of food is great in my opinion. What i like: 1. FOOD FOOD FOOD-the batter is crispy and the fish is flaky & fresh2. Ambiance- very cute & clean cottage on the beach feel. 3. Staff is SUPER friendly and cool. And very helpful for suggestions.",

Upon walking the staff was very friendly to me and seated me upstairs. I ordered the salmon sole, a drink (dandelion and burdock) and a custard dessert of the day. My drink came right away, I was willing to try a new drink and he waitor had suggested it tastes very similar to coke. I gave it a try, it has some herbs in it and it tastes healthy and carbonated. I had to ask for ice later on as my drink was no long chilled and it doesn't taste the same when it's not cold. (\u00a32.95 for the drink)The salmon and sole was (\u00a313.95) it came really deep fried, a large portion. I could not finish the chips or the fish. Personally it was too fried for me and very bland - they do have salt and pepper on tables tho! It wa so fried that I was able to seperate the fish from the fried batter very very easily. The chips was great! It was moist and not too crunchy. I loved them but I couldn't finish the plate as it was too large of a portion. They have placemats and they were informative by telling guests where the fish is from (Norway) and the potatoes from Essex. I ended the meal with a pudding dessert which was way too sweet for me. I was hoping for a custard instead I got a sponge cake type dessert. The service here is very slow. THere is only 1 waitor working the top floor (where most the seats are). It took me at least 15 minutes to ask for my dessert and waited another 10 minutes for it to come. Once I was done wih everything it took another 10 minutes to get his attention as get the bill.It was a good experience but I probably would not be coming again since it was slow and the fish was personally too deep fried for me.",

    "text": "Those ordering a takeaway pay significantly less than those eating in. I won't deny that a summer picnic in Hyde Park seems the ideal situation in which to enjoy the British staple of fish & chips, however, an evening winter meal calls for enjoying The Fish House's upstairs dining area, its stark white walls modestly decorated with framed photographs, the space so crowded that our waiter barely has room to move between tables. It's warm & inviting up there & the large windows facing Pembridge Road offer a very London view of double decker busses driving past. We shared an order of Crispy Fried Prawns (9 for \u00a310.90) & the large portion of Cod & Chips (\u00a314.50), which was more than enough for two hungry diners. Douse every flakey bite in malt vinegar & if you are so inclined, try the sharply-flavored onion condiment on the table. We were pleased with these condiments, but wished the tarter sauce tasted of more than just mayo. A heads up for those who care: skin is left on on one side of the fish, which was easy for me to avoid. Delicious, crispy chips, probably the best I had on this trip!",

    "text": "My history with fish and chips dates back to my days abroad in England, marked mostly by drunk late night cravings at sketchy takeaway spots, or default meals at dark pubs. Therefore, it's refreshing to see The Fish House offer an alternative for the non-degenerate crowd - a chippy that's kitchen-tiled, clean, white-and-teal, and nautical-themed. Not to mention, they were bumpin' upbeat reggae and island beats, which just seems like pretty important info in general.The Fish House offers the same general fare as its down and dirtier brethren, though here they celebrate their responsibly sourced seafood. I got my standard order of Haddock and Chips, with a side of Mushy Peas (plus a Meantime London Lager) - and the fish was excellent. The batter was light without being puffy, crispy without being crusty - that solid-coated combo that only a well-trained, English deep-fryer can miraculously manage. So, how did we get here? After a stroll down Portobello Road, nearing the Notting Hill Gate tube stop, we weren't exactly looking for fish and chips, but man, were we glad we found it. It's not entirely surprising us tourists got sucked in here, given what it lacks in authentic digs, it manages to make up with inviting charm. The downstairs is a spick-and-span takeaway counter, while the upstairs brings you to a casual dining room overlooking some lovely London backyards. And in lieu of traditional male and female stick figures on the toilet doors, you have images of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, in case you forgot the neighborhood you were in and/or a certain 1999 rom-com of the same name.I forwent my typical fish and chips research prior to my recent trip to London, rightfully assuming we'd stumble in the right direction at some point. While I expected this to come in the form of greasier fare in styrofoam trays, the quality upgrade was a delicious diversion and worthy of a recommendation for those headed into town. Despite its softer appearance, The Fish House makes a mean fish and chips.",

I've had much better fish and chips (for MUCH less cost - why is the exact same order 4.70 pounds cheaper if ordered for takeout? I've never heard of such a thing) in the UK in the last week. Also, and I hate to be a stereotypical American here, but the service at restaurants in the UK is baffling (at least in my experience). My 8 year old son wanted a Coke and we saw several cans of them at the takeout counter when we first came in. Our waiter told us they only had Diet Coke because they only serve bottles upstairs, not cans. He said he would have to charge us 2.40 if he gave us a can. Huh? How about just giving my son what he wants and adjusting the price accordingly? Then my young daughter spilled about 70% of her drink. When he came over to clean it up, he didn't offer to bring a new one over like any waiter at any restaurant in the US would. I just find the lack of customer service at restaurants here so odd. It was especially frustrating that this place automatically included a 12% gratuity in the bill because it was not earned. Overall, not a great experience.",

The finishing touch was that they were wrapped in newspaper..: Awww cuteness! The chips were fat and juicy, exactly how good chips should be!

Get the pudding of the day. It's simple, yet so delicious. I highly enjoyed that. Mine was chocolate and the middle was all melty & oozing chocolate, like a molten lava cake. I was in heaven. I seen a lot of reviews saying they charge extra to sit in. ALLLL places in England charge extra to sit in. It's a service charge. Basically, their TIP. We Americans tip anyways, so that's nothing that is so upsetting to us. You're supposed to tip. Service was very friendly. I knocked one star off for being a little pricey.

The small cod and chips came with a surprisingly decent portion of fish. The tartare sauce was pretty good. The chips were eh. Pass, I've had better chips. I really liked how the outside of the fish was so crispy, and stayed crispy. Unfortunately, the fish itself was flavorless, which is due to the fish itself likely. But I didn't think this meal was too enjoyable for my taste.",

This place got everything right they were just a bit pricier than another place I tried in Lincolnshire. I really liked this place. I ate here 3 times before heading back to the US. I had a lots of fish and chips while in the UK and (like most British food) the fish breading is usually pretty bland so to find a place where you don't have to add salt is worth another try and a good review. Defiantly would recommend. The staff is also very nice. A couple of Italian or French guys who know their fish.",

    "text": "The Fish House of Notting Hill was a definite winner on our first dinner in London. Walking right inside before we got seated upstairs and I could already smell fresh fish in their kitchen and I knew right then we were in for something really good. After a ten hour flight I was in the mood for something filling. So I ordered the \"British Beef 6 oz. Gourmet Burger with bacon & cheese\" (10.50 GBP). Since the beef patty is 6 oz. it truly was a tasty burger. The layer of bacon gave it a little salted taste and the bread roll bun was soft. I did like the melted cheese in between. It was a well rounded burger that included fresh cut chips. For Fish & Chips we ordered it in the \"Cod\" option. In regular size (14.50 GBP). Once it was served I could already see its batter and it looked mighty good. On my first bite it does have a flaky texture, and it didn't taste fishy at all, so it wasn't too crazy. It was melt in your mouth goodness, that I could definitely get into. The tartar sauce tasted simple and gave it a good mayonnaise flavor. The malted vinegar as condiments was of course the icing on the cake. Prior to the visit I don't eat seafood of any kind and to have their Fish & Chips experience it was exceptional. I went with the traditional \"Meantime London Pale Ale\" (3.95 GBP). This beer tasted mildly citrusy with a little bitter at the end. Overall, it paired with our meals quite well. We got friendly service here. The simple easy to read menus was great, and dining in was comfortable making the experience well worth it to enjoy Fish House's delicious Fish & Chips.",

Codmother's is one of my favorite just saying.)Located in Notting Hill, near the Portobello Road Market. The location was very convenient and it had a fair share of people even when it was late. There's an option of dine in and dine out. I wish that we knew that there was a difference. We just went in, there were limited seats (and all occupied), and we were told we had to take it out (which was fine.) The tartar sauce was alright. The fish was crunchy, and also had the skin in it. I don't like fish skin sooo I prefer it didn't have that. There were multiple options for fish and I believe we got the cod (most basic.) The servings was also huuuge, so we didn't finish it. Best part of it was it was very fresh, and made to order! If you're here and you wanna try fish and chips, this isn't a bad choice.",

We split a large haddock and chips (\u00a314.5) and that was definitely enough food for two people. The fish was probably a foot long. We also had the salt and pepper calamari, but it was very chewy and a tiny portion, so I'd skip that. Service here is very brusque, but I like that since there is often a line for lunchtime and mainly people want to eat and leave. The Fish House was my favorite fish n chips in all of London.
