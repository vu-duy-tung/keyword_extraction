Nothing that made me say \"now THAT was some good shit!\". But after having dinner with my husband at Indian City last week I can honestly say that I've had the best Indian I've ever eaten. We shared an order of garlic naan and onion bhajees to start- the bhajees are things dreams are made of. I NEED to figure out how to make them at home. For my entree I ordered the chicken joypuri. Inhaled. It. Amazingly good. I really can't wait to try everything else on the menu, however, seeing as I'm in Indiana, it'll be kinda hard... and I'm going to be CRAVING Indian City!",

    "text": "Quick review:+ set menu for lunch - good value+ speedy service+ friendly staff+ lots of space- a bit dark for interiorI came here on a Friday lunch time with a colleague, after we walked away from two nearby Chinese restaurants due to long queues. We were a bit worried how empty it looked in Indian City on Friday lunch timebut decided to give a try anyway. The entryway is narrow and we walked past a few tables through to the back of the restaurant which has more space. The set menu is pretty good value, under \u00a37 for a main, or just under \u00a39 for a starter and main. We ordered from the express lunch menu and the food arrived very quickly, which is great for those who may want hot food but hasn't got hours for a sit down lunch. The food was very tasty and the portion size was small, compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to, but it's plenty of food for lunch especially for the value. i also liked that the restaurant does not automatically add service charge on top of the bill. The only downside is that it feels pretty dark inside, but it doesn't detract from the service nor the food. The staff is friendly and held the doors for us, with genuine smiles, as we exited the restaurant. I will definitely come back when I'm feeling particularly hungry for a work lunch!",

Service = Horrible \u00a0Food = BadNaan = GoodI am in London for work and decided to eat dinner at this establishment after work around 9:10PM on this Thursday. I walked in and the gentleman asked me how many people and I stated one and he responded saying they are full. I pointed out EIGHT open tables I could see and he stated they were all reserved and asked me if I wanted take out. I was unhappy about this but it was late, raining and the place was reviewed well so I decided to take him up on the takeout. He asked me to take a seat at one of the open tables so I did and I then witnessed 3 groups of 2-3 people come in, without reservations, all get seated. I then asked again if I could just eat at the table they had already seated me at and they refused once again. I kept my spirits high hoping the food would be worth the pain however the Paneer Tikka Masala was just as bad and super sweet! I will say the Naan was solid however it did not make up for everything else. I hate to say it but it was almost as if they were being racist to Indians. Really weird experience since I was born and raised in America and there for work. This really caught me off guard since the entire staff was Indian. Felt like I was in Pete from Remember the Titans trying to eat at a restaurant that's racist.Never going back to this place and yes this is my first review EVER and I've been using this app for years.",

However, the food is magnificent and the service is friendly. This is not your run-fo-the-mill tikka house- you can find a much more diverse range of Indian styles here, and I would suggest venturing off the beaten path.I had the Gosht Tawa, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The lamb is tender and served with a healthy helping of veggies in a rich, complex tomato based sauce which has some tangy hints of lime-leaf. Overall, this wasn't a spicy dish, but watch out for those peppers! A mouthful of these hot little dudes can really make you sweat. Another good choice is the green chilli chicken or spinach. Theres a nice selection of wine as well, and all of it is very affordable. If you love Indian food and aren't afraid to try something new, this is a great place to eat casually or formally.",

I had a lamb dish that was rated very spicy on the menu (2 out of 2 chili peppers), and it was true to it's rating. I couldn't really taste the meat/seasoning. I like spicy food, but only if there are good flavors to match. It's possible my palette has been too Americanized with less-spicy Indian, I suppose. Also tried an eggplant dish that was a little bland and a chicken dish that was 1 out of 2 spicy-pepper rated. The sauce was a little spicy, but there were also whole peppers mixed in that had the friend I was with sweating and not enjoying the dish. I ate one of the peppers and it was just as hot as my 2-pepper dish. It would be improved if the peppers were on the side or excluded.",

To put it plainly the food was crazy sweet. Honest opinion super sweet Indian food is freaking nasty. It's like they just went ahead and added 200 grams of sugar to our meal. Sort of like having a super nasty energy drink in the food. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy trying new things but why in our 30 years of combined Indian food eating experience enjoy having sweet Indian food. There was no real warning this food was super sweet. We added rice and spice to the food to see if we can fix the taste and there was no helping this meal. The rice was sweet as well. But why the heck is Saag Paneer super sweet. It just makes no sense. Did we miss something here? Was this somebody's sick joke. Lets put this in perspective. Sugar is delicious with cake, coffee and tea but not Indian food. They did take the Chicken Tikka Masala off the bill but made us pay for the Saag Paneer. It did get a bit uncomfortable and upsetting when the manager was having an argument with my wife about this. Clearly he needs to learn a bit of manners that the customer is right and just take the meal off the bill and get on with it. I suppose the customer is never right in this country and we just have to grin and bear it. Wine and Naan was ok thankfully. People with diabetic issues beware.",

    "text": "Let me add a small dose of reality here. If you are stranded in the heart of the \u00a0City on a Sunday night you will notice that your choice of restaurants is slim to say the least. If it is near 10pm and you have crossed out the option of a taxi ride to Brick Lane, you are grateful to find Indian City open. The menu is interesting with a few specials, decor is nice, and service welcoming. 5 stars so far. I like spicy Indian food but don't want to go all out to Vindaloo-style tastebuds annihilation. The conversation with the waiter normally includes placing your spice taste on a scale of 1 to 10. My spice number is 7.5. Well here I was forced too settle to 2 on a scale of 3, no off-menu spice tuning available: 4-stars! Here comes the food, good, tuned to please international guests I would say, which explains the \"I fell off my chair\" ratings by foreigners. Here comes the cheese nan: 3-quarters from one, and the last quarter much more cooked and obviously from another basket! I pinch myself, thinking this is a mistake which is going to be rectified in the next nano-second. I pull out my phone, stand up, take a picture (with flash) of the Frankenstein nan basket, look \u00a0around me, no waiter and no movement! Down to 1-star! I decide to eat the rest of my meal, although with suspicion in my mind that other dishes might have been patchworked from other remains (in hindsight I am pretty sure the rest was fine). At the end of the meal, a complimentary amaretto comes with the bill: back to 2-stars. My discussion with the waiter about the nan finally comes to the admission of a mistake and an offer for a free nan next time (a free meal would have been more appropriate in my opinion). I decide to settle on 3-star as the final discussion was friendly and suitably apologetic and overall the food was good. Might go back if I'm stranded on a Sunday night again, but will inspect the integrity of what lands on my table.",

Beautiful ambiance, very pleasant staff, great service, and delicious food.Saturday night around 8 pm there was a pretty good crowd, but not fl enough for a wait. I would say 75% full at any given time. Very calming, clean setting.The menu is infinitely larger than most Indian restaurant menus, which is fantastic especially because they actually get their dishes right. They know what they're doing.We ordered the chicken balti and the chicken vindaloo. The balti was indicated to be a medium spice level and the vindaloo was indicated to be very hot. Both were accurately described, which is not as common as you'd think. Often times a dish is indicated as spicy and it doesn't even come close. I loved that these were appropriately labeled, but also had flavors other than pure heat that came through.As someone who has a very high tolerance for spice, I did not fine the vindaloo lacking and would not have wanted it any spicier at all. It is extremely spicy let me warn you so not for the faint of tongue. But what's nice is that you can also taste the very tomatoey flavor as well as the other spices. The heat does not mask everything. It's well done.The balti was delicious as well. Milder, but very flavorful. The two of them together were even better. They balanced each other.They have many rice options including a steamed rices, which is plain and not oiled for the more Heath conscious. Honestly with the delicious sauces of the dishes, you can't even taste the lack of oil in the rice so I'd recommend that unless you plan to each rice without mixing it with a saucy dish. Only con is that the rice is so expensive for such a small portion. You really need one per person, so it adds up quickly.We also ordered garlic naan and asked for light butter on top which they accommodated. I loved the fact that they are health conscious in general. When we asked whether the dishes would be oily, we were informed that whenever possible, the chef likes to cut as much oil as he can. We did find this to be a true, which is appreciated. The dishes were substantial and hardy, but didn't make you feel badly after eating them. Perfect balance.The mango lassi was also great - not as sweet as many other lassis, which is a huge added plus. A lot of times they put so much sugar and you can barely taste the yogurt. This was much more balanced and authentic. I'd strongly recommend this place and will be back many times, I'm sure!",

My wife and I live in Chicago and are fortunate to have dined in many fine Indian restaurants, but none exceed the quality and service of this establishment.We enjoyed an outstanding meal that featured garlic naan, Chicken Rogan Josh, and Chicken Tikka Masala -- all delicious! The Tikka Masala was a bit on the sweeter side than other versions I've had, but was terrific nonetheless. The complimentary shots of iced Amaretto were the icing on the cake, so to speak...and given London's notorious high prices, the bill was very reasonable. We highly recommend Indian City -- you cannot go wrong!",

    "text": "The reason for this star rating isn't the quality of the food. We never actually got to try the food. We were treated so poorly, we left before they even brought us our water. My parents are pretty picky about eating out, so we've been to countless Indian restaurants around the world. We've never had such rude, biased service before. As we were waiting to be seated, we were chatting with another American group who was equally excited to try the restaurant. We were called to sit first, and before we could even walk in the door, a waiter stood in our way and warned, \"Everybody in your party has to order their own main dish. No sharing...minimum one dish per person.\"We were kind of taken aback. We didn't understand why they were being so insistent about this rule, but we figured they must have some strong policy in place and it wasn't that big of a deal.The other group was seated shortly after us, and they were warmly greeted and seated. They never got the ultimatum that the waiter was so insistent on giving to us. Whatever, we thought. Let's look past it and enjoy dinner.A few minutes pass by. Still no waiter. The group seated after us? Sipping on water and munching on the appetizers they ordered. ...still no service. Finally, a waiter comes to take our order. We start ordering and he cuts us off abruptly because a new group just walked in and needed to be seated. Other staff members were already seating them, but our waiter felt the need to help them.He finally came back after a few minutes. After rudely taking our order, he walked away. We decided we had had enough rude treatment, told him to cancel our order, and we left. Now the twist. All the other diners were white. We're Indian. I'm not a big fan of playing the race card, but I am aware of a certain type of bias that goes on at times. And I think it's interesting when people get mistreated by their own ethnic group. The entire wait staff was Indian, and sometimes Indian people try to show off and \"impress the white man.\" In this restaurant, it was clear the restaurant had certain priorities in mind. Whatever the case, they clearly weren't thrilled about serving us with so many other important customers to tend to. As we were walking out, our waiter approached us to ask if everything was ok. Too late, pal. The damage had been done. We hopped in a cab to Punjab at 80 Neal street and had a GREAT meal with even GREATER service. Indian city, we wanted to like you. But you need to figure out how to take care of all of your customers. Not just the ones you want to impress. Good riddance. Thankfully, there are more than enough great Indian restaurants around London to keep us from having to step foot in your terrible establishment again. And yes, I created a yelp profile tonight in order to write this review at 11:30 at night. That's how horrid the experience was.",

They served up a nice quartet of chutneys with crispy flat crackers and the appetizer sampler (samosas, kabob, paneer, fried onions, chicken tikka, and greens) was a great start. Full of flavor that was satisfying to the palette! My main course of prawns in a slightly spicy sauce was great! My wife noted her Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit on the sweeter side but was still very flavorful. The vibe of the place was simple elegance; staff were all friendly and professional; low key and chill. Check this place out if you're ever near the Blackfriars Station in London!",

I actually really have grown to enjoy Indian food over the last few years so I was really excited about this trip. I made reservations on Yelp which is always a nice perk. Reservations were not needed, although it was filling up by the time we left at 9 PM. When my group of 3 got there, we were greeted by the friendly staff, and seated right away. We ordered the tikki masala, chatt, chicken tawa and some side vegetarian dishes. Tawa is a dish that is special to the British culture and that was my favorite. The chicken was tandoori marinated and then stir fried with plenty of vegetables. It had some heat to it, but was not overwhelming. The Tikki Masala was quite different than I am used to in America, but not in a bad way. It was more of a sweet dish rather than savory. Our waiter mentioned that Butter Chicken might be more like what we are used to! Glad we tried it though.Another perk is that they serve 550 ml beers for a reasonable price!",

We saw that Indian City would still be open for another 45 min so we walked over. When we walked in it turns out because it was a slower late evening they had decided to close up a little early. Instead of just Turing us away they offered to put together a take out order for us. All the staff that interacted with us were very friendly and did not seem inconvenienced by accommodating us at all. That covers the service side, which to me is the more important piece. Now on to the food. I ordered the lamb saag. It was fantastic. It was fresh and flavorful. I liked that it was a bit chunkier than what I'm used to. It had a good kick to it, but not overly spicy. Great balance. My other half ordered the chicken tikka masala. I noticed right away that it had a lovely citrus tone to it. It was a little sweet, but not in a bad way. The rice was cooked to perfection. The accompanying sauces were wonderful. We would recommend this place very highly. Thank you for feeding these hungry foreigners past close time.

This was so much better than the others it should be a different kind of food.)When you walk in, you think you're about to have a \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 meal and the ambassador is going to ask you for the time. Maybe James Bond is going to crash the place - it's pretty swanky. The aromas are amazing - curry, turmeric, coriander, and more. The pre-appetizer (crispy flat cake with various sauces) had four distinct flavors, each of which seemed like the chef spent all his effort on. \u00a0Very different from traditional Indian fare (which is good even still!). \u00a0The mint chutney was our favorite.We ordered Saag Paneer and Green Chicken. The saag paneer came out in a more dry and less blended form than normal, but the flavors were powerful but not heavy. Without the heavy cream, it was a fantastic dish. The waiter then brought me a dish of saag paneer in a more traditional style. He thought I might have expected more traditional, so he asked the chef to make another one - I didn't ask or comment, he just did it to make our experience wonderful. It was. The saag paneer with coconut cream was out of this world. My wife's green chicken was something new, but brilliant. Tender chicken breast filets covered in a flavorful aromatic coriander paste was something new and amazing. The mango coco dessert topped it off. Overall, after having Indian food in 4 continents and who knows how many countries, this was the best by far. So much better, in fact, we wondered if this was a different kind of Indian food. Hands down, the best dinner we've had in years. Thank you!",

Everything from the decor of the restaurant (which includes a simple yet elegant floral and butterfly decoration on the wall with funky cacti in front of very clean mirrors) to the presentation of the food shows that effort has been put into appearance and some style and yet it still all seems to lack some panache; there is no common theme or all-round achievement in any of its features.\u00a0The juice I had did not taste fresh but was not too sweet either so it served its purpose. The sides/dips for the Poppadoms did taste homemade and appetising. The Aloo Chat Puree starter I had went down well because I was hungry but in actual fact the side salad and the dressing was of a better quality than the wrap itself (which seemed slightly soggy). The garlic naan was fair enough; it had hints of garlic, was a good size and not too oily but not particularly well done either (perhaps a bit on the thick side). The Green Chicken Tikka was nicely sizzling hot, containing a generous portion of chicken with subtle flavours and a decent texture and also comes with some complimenting side salad. The lemon rice was a good portion and an attractive golden colour with some unknown gentle spices within the mix. Meanwhile the duck (which I tried off a friend) was unnecessarily spicy and soaked through.\u00a0All-in-all from what I experienced, Indian City is largely inoffensive and pleasant but not quite outstanding.",

Everything came out very quickly as well.",

My family is Indian so perhaps we wanted something more authentic. The chicken tikka masala was super sweet. Everything else (saag paneer, channa, daal) lacked salt and had odd flavors. I think the daal had cinnamon in it which was very off putting. My children, who love Indian food and eat it several times a week, ended up eating bananas in our hotel room after. It is a nice restaurant with a good ambiance, slightly formal. There were no other children there and it is lit with candles. The majority of customers appeared to be locals and businessman. However, the food is not authentic and has been possibly altered to suit the local palate.",

They poured our wine for us and treated us like we were the only people there. The normal menu was off and they had a special Christmas menu. It was pricey, and it was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The butter chicken was absolutely perfect, and there was an abundant selection of appetizers to enjoy along with several chutneys and sauces.",

That won't stop us from returning - it really is a happy, lovely place where you can feast like a king - but definitely opt for dishes described on the menu as spicy or complex; otherwise, you may find yourself asking to pass the salt.",

(A detail that I found very pleasant) Someone will most likely greet you and ask about reservations. \u00a0Don't be alarmed. \u00a0They will still seat you rather quickly at lovely candle-lit cloth-covered tables.The food and beverages are flavorful and well-portioned. (We enjoyed every last bite!)The rice which comes with nearly all the dishes (if you don't opt for naan) is particularly aromatic. \u00a0I found myself thoroughly impressed by just their side dishes!This is a great date location.I couldn't see myself revisiting this place with friends but I would love another special evening here. \u00a0The ambiance was honestly just too cozy and romantic (and sometimes formal).",

    "text": "This is a phenomenal hole-in-the-wall. If you want great Indian cuisine, London has it, in fact, I've met Indians who have told me London has better Indian food than Mumbai these days - though I can't substantiate that claim, I can only say Indian City can serve up a mean dish. Totally packed on a friday night, we didn't have reservations but were informed there would be roughly a 1-1/5 hour wait. We decided to go to the pub next door for a few drinks and wait. It worked out great. Going back to Indian City a couple of hours later, the manager welcomed us, stating he didn't think we would come back, and wished he had a better located table for us, it was near the main walkway, kind of high traffic spot, but we were fine with it. The lighting was mood-lit, and the service was attentive. The took our coats to the cloakroom, and we began with Tandoori king prawn and two Cobra beers. The beer was served ice cold and the prawn was melt in your mouth amazing. The creaminess, blended beautifully with the spices, and the soft texture of the prawn the perfect pairing.The manager was very helpful when asked for assistance on picking our entrees, and really helped us narrow down our choices based on our spice and flavor preferences. For our entrees, we opted for Chicken Rogan Josh and Chicken Dansak with pilau rice and garlic and peshwari naan. Everything was out-of-this-world delicious. Flavor factor was at the highest level, plenty of chicken to sauce ratio. The naan was soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges, with garlic and cilantro covering the buttery bread. The manager and server checked in on us multiple times, even though he had much larger parties and a very full restaurant, we appreciated his attentiveness. For dessert we ordered a coconut and mango pureed sorbet, which I can't recall the name of the top of my head, which as expected was delicious, beautifully presented and perfect for cleansing the palate after a great meal.The restaurant was impeccably clean, the busboys constantly removing plates and changing table cloths, not to mention it didn't smell of strong curry when we walked in (which is notorious and sometimes overwhelming in Indian restaurants). The decor was lovely, and the beautiful copper leaf chandelier above us was exquisite. We left extremely happy and will most definitely visit again when in London.",

    "text": "Family felt like having Indian food so we headed here after seeing it was within .1 mile of our hotel and had strong ratings from Yelpers (you guys are awesome!) Restaurant is very formal with the wait staff all in whites, but the atmosphere is cozy and personnel are attentive and friendly.We loved the korma chicken, sag paneer, and sag chicken. We liked the tikka massala chicken but not as much as the dish by the same name at our fave Indian restaurant back home, but admittedly this is strictly a personal preference and probably biased taste buds. We'd order it again. Naan bread was also perfectly done. Very nice!",

Based on the price and other reviews, we thought it would be a more casual experience, but we were greeted by a server asking if we had a reservation, then looked around to see white table cloths and a higher end setup.The service was pretty good, but the food was on the bland side. I've had lots of Indian food, and even other Indian food in London, and found much more flavorful dishes on the East End (around Brick Lane Market is my favorite area for Indian).That said, everything was fresh and the servers were attentive.",
