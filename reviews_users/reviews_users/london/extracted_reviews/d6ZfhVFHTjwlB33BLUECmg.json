It is open for breakfast and doesn't close until quite late. At night it can become quite crowded so best to get here early to get a table otherwise it's not much fun. I prefer to come in the day for brunch when it is less busy. The Eggs Benedict are done particularly well. It is a good place in Central London to eat and drink. I've given it three stars instead of four as, whilst the service is usually good, I came once with a friend and the waiter who served us was pretty stuck up and obnoxious.",

There was a lively atmosphere and it was quite full but we managed to get seats and stayed for quite a few rounds! The glasses of wine are quite large so I reckon you're drinking about a third of a bottle in one glass. A nice cabernet sauvignon, but I had a huge hangover the next day, so beware large measures \u00a0they can be deceptive! The bar staff are very entertaining, twirling bottles around and showing off. And when some Michael Jackson music came on, one of them even got up and started dancing and moonwalking! (Quite amusing when you've had a few large glasses of red.) Not cheap, but what can you expect in Soho? I'd definitely go back again.",

The service was charming, the place itself is lovely - bustling enough to be exciting but with a civilised atmosphere that doesn't make you feel like a terrible person for having dinner at midnight. The one criticism I would have is that I asked for my steak medium rare, and it looked like it had barely seen a pan, but I'm not that fussy so it wasn't a problem for me. The food is nice, simple and hearty, not particularly fine dining, but it's perfect for the place.

Excellent breakfast menu, try the Boheme special - \u00a310 for full English with coffee and juice. (Why pay \u00a320 at your hotel for greasy bacon and slimey eggs when you can come here, read the morning paper sitting in the airy front parlour glancing out at the first stirrings of Old Compton Street?) Fantastic coffee! So smooth and bitter and strong enough to kick start the brain cells into some sort of action again. Excellent quality food to go with it. (From the reviews previously, sounds a riot sometimes in the evenings, but can reassure that at breakfast, there were no twirling bottles, dancing and moonwalking, just a perfectly appropriate calm, friendly and quiet ambiance \u00a0could really have stayed all day and waited for the moonwalking, but did eventually drag away into the cold reality of central London \u00a0but glowing like the Ready Brek kid.)

When an American girl envisions herself dining out in London, she pictures this (or at least, I would). Trendy (for the most part), comfortable with a touch of romance, it's a great place for friends or a one on one dinner. The first night we went, I ordered mussels for a starter, which were meaty and cooked perfectly. And generously served. For a main, I chose the confit duck leg with red cabbage -- extremely tasty, and as a fairly regular duck consumer, it is definitely one of my favorite preparations and combinations of flavor. The meat was savory and tender and fell right off the bone, and the cabbage was a great complement. The second night we went, we shared the ham and cheese croquettes which were absolutely delicious. As a main, I went with the smoked haddock. Also incredibly savory, the wonderful, melt-in-your-mouth haddock with the perfectly seasoned potatoes was excellent. As much as I tease my boyfriend for being such a regular here, I will probably insist upon returning every time I visit.",

The accompanying crackling was too hard to eat and had obviously been around for a while, as had the stale bread. The fillet steak was mostly fat. Just disgusting. Couldn't eat that either. In fact the only acceptable dish was the mean portion of cheese I received with my crackers. To the manager's credit (Tom), he took the rillette off the bill. I didn't have the heart to mention the beef to him. Omg stay away from this tourist trap, the worst of its kind!",

All in all a great place for a drink in Soho which is even lovelier during the summer with its outside seating.",

    "text": "I stumbled into this place on a very merry evening. I've walked past it many a time but I have never had the urge to go in, maybe this is because it looks quite sophisticated and pretentious. It's in the centre of Soho's gay district and it had a good mix of all sorts of people from all over the world which created a great mixing pot and totally countered my initial impression of it being pretentious.The wines were good (not that i know a great deal about wines!) but they can get quite pricey. They ranged from \u00a313 a bottle right up to \u00a350 but you really get the continental feel of a French Wine Bar. It's a good place to stop off in before going to a club. If you were looking for somewhere to take a date though I'd chose somewhere else as it can get VERY busy in there and it's difficult to have a conversation.",

It is a small place that really encompasses the Soho vibe of community mixed with posh, urban splendour.The menu is French and from experience the burger is great and the bangers and mash (I'm not sure they do anymore) was lovely. They are not the cheapest caf\u00e9 by a long way, but if it is after hours and you are still hungry and want something good to eat this is the place.",

He flat-out refused to do so, saying that it was a bar, after all, and that we could move when a table became free in the dining room. Well, I'm sorry, but you should not SERVE a full-course dinner at the bar if you are going to allow your customers to get that rowdy. It really ruined our meal, even though our waitress, who was from Barcelona, was a real sweetheart.",

Service was rather slow outside, unfortunately, so we had to wait a while for drinks. There was some confusion, because eventually we thought we had to order in the bar area, and then ended up ordering two drinks each because the waiter finally came around outside while someone was inside. The peanuts they served with the wine were rancid, and we had to send them back. Because of the peanut issue, we decided not to have dinner here, and just settled the check after a bottle of ros\u00e9. The drinks are not too pricey, so that's not bad. Overall, this is just a random bar in SoHo. Can't remember much special about Caf\u00e9 Boheme, so that's all I have to say...",

It's always heaving so you may need to wait at the bar for a little while for a table, but it's definitely worth it. The drinks on offer are fantastic too. Impressive wine list, cocktails, and the strongest, tastiest little coffees.Being French this was always going to be a winner with me, the menu is simple and to die for, and the food is executed to perfection. C'est magnifique!This time around I went for the deep fried Camembert with onion chutney to start, it was like a little piece of heaven melting in my mouth... Drool. The onion had a slight cinnamony taste which I usually don't like but it really worked nicely here.I went for the fillet steak frites, with a peppercorn sauce and accompanied by green beans. It was knock out. Every time I come it never fails me. Lovely relaxed but buzzing atmosphere. Adore this place it's such a fail safe option in sea of uncertainty.",

The food was better than average but nothing exquisite.

I've eaten here a few times and both lunch and breakfast menus are good, solid options that will certainly accommodate the majority of taste buds. The setting is also very nice, upon walking in your thrown back a few years and into central Paris. Really french themed atmosphere and they do very well with keeping that feeling going - On sunny days, drinks and table spill out side and you can enjoy the bustle of the city go past. Although I've never had a bad experience in here, it just gets a little too manic for me. I feel they could remove about 10 tables from inside (obviously aware that's bad for business, and there's no need too because people flock to this place) which would give it a lot more of a relaxed and kicked-back feeling. The tables are jammed and on the last lunch visit we had a very small table, ideally for two, but threw the four of us on. It actually didn't fit the 4 plates of food on and I was left eating on my lap. Not a major deal, but just would of been nice on a bigger spot. Saying this, the food and drink is very nice. Very good coffee, that has warranted me visiting on a few occasions and the morning porridge is also a normal go-to. Outside of food, the drinks are also good. They offer some nice cocktails and if you're up for a few of them, it's a nice busy environment to do it! In all, a nice place thats hugely popular and a good way to chill a little in such a busy area. If you want outstanding dishes, I'd probably go elsewhere but still nice to be seen in!...",

    "text": "Have drinks here but perhaps consider eating before you arrive.The location is wonderfully placed in the heart of Soho, but that's really as exciting as it get. They offer a theatre menu which is great value for money, in theory. However in practise it was pretty grim.Starter Whitebait - The batter used had far to much flour and not enough seasoning.Main Rump Steak - This cow must have been a hunk of a heifer as my piece of arse was mainly fat, and not in a phat kinda way.Dessert - I passed and pudding and simply ordered more champagne!The Grey Goose Fizz is tart but tremendous - just how I like it. More wine vicar!",

I've always walked past at night and it's always bustling with people and when I found out they do breakfast I thought I'd give it a go. The decor is very warming and its quite spacious inside. I ended up going for the set breakfast, where you get eggs, bacon on toast with a fresh orange and coffee. Quality of the ingredients were great but the portion size on the small size. Probably because as it fell in the deal. (Visit - 18/07/2015 Breakfast)",

I tend to go in the late afternoon for their pitcher of beers with a few old colleagues as we used to work in Mayfair. This time my friends and I had decided to convene at the watering hole in the evening. It is still a very pleasant place, but the volume of people seems to astronomically increase over the hours of the evening. A great place to be with friends for a casual drink at a slightly hyper place. The crowd are pleasant, and the music is neither too obnoxious nor too quiet. I highly recommend it compared to the crowded Dean Street Town House.",

    "text": "I came here recently for birthday drinks with some girlie friends. Like all 'trendy' places in Soho with ample outdoor seating (in order to oogle passers by) it's reliably busy. The bar side itself is very small and only has one bar staff on at any given time it seems. They also have bar stools which makes it even more difficult to get served. In addition to the difficulties of getting a seat and getting served, the cocktail list is pretty uninspiring and they only serve beer by the half pint or jug. Despite this, the place exceeded my expectations. The staff were lovely (on the bar side) and very attentive. The overall \u00a0atmosphere was chilled and the place was full with a good and unpretentious crowd. With the addition of half price on drinks, I can say I had a good night. I say - if you see a table, grab it and get one it.",

The wait stuff was always close bye and ensured everything was as required and that we enjoyed ourselves.I had the \u00a310 Boheme breakfast which comes with and omelette with nice crispy toast, on the spot made freshly squeezed orange juice and loose leave tea. The food was delicious and just the right size ( portions aren't huge, but just enough to fill me up and not have the overstuffed feeling).I am surprised this place isn't packed for Sunday brunch! Will definitely return for more lazy mornings with the girls.",
