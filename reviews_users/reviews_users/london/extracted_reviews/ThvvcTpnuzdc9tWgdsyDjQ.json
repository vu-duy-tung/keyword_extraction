I had the Hummus with Lamb pieces as a starter which was very good. \u00a0All the starters in the group looked good and were generally large portions. \u00a0Certainly the bowls of mussels were huge and the mussels themselves were pretty large too!For main course I had the Duck breast which was very good too, although could possibly have been a bit pinker. \u00a0Again all the mains looked nice and were larger portions. \u00a0The steak looked a little thin and was therefore not medium but apparently tasted good anyway.For dessert I had the waffle with the raspberry coulis and ice cream, which was also very nice. \u00a0A number of our group had the cakes from the front of the restaurant and they were apparently very good too.All in all, good service, good food and a good night.",

Total bill came to around \u00a350 including a bottle of wine (plus 2 free glasses that the manager gave us as we moved tables to accomodate another booking \u00a0we didn't mind at all but if someone is going to give me free wine I'm not going to say no!). Make sure you save room for dessert \u00a0the selection at the cake buffet by the window at the front is amazing. I'm going back as soon as I can!",

    "text": "Having a cake selection in the window is a tried and tested means of drawing in customers. Walking past the brightly lit Fig and Olive I knew that the last piece of White Chocolate Cheesecake was going to be mine. Deciding what I was going to have before that was a lot more difficult. The Fig & Olive suffers from a menu which is quite frankly daunting in size. Between the starters, mains, salads, specials and a brunch selection, it's quite a stress trying to figure out what you actually want to eat. Most people around us we eating breakfasts but I wanted to be a bit more adventurous and so my friend and I opted to share three starters (a plan concocted to make sure that we left plenty of room for cakes later). We choose the Chargrilled Calamari, the Halloumi and Vegetable Stack and the Chorizo in a Parmesan Bowl. All three were great although I'm sure it was not the chef's original intention for the 'Parmesan Bowl' to be quite so chewy. That said, the squid was deliciously seared and the roast vegetables sweet and sticky. The food was also very reasonably priced as the whole meal with coffee's, cakes and wine only costed about \u00a315 each. \u00a0 The service in this restaurant is great and you can see that the waiters are making a real effort to go that extra mile. When I asked if the slice of Cheesecake was still left my waitress almost sprinted to the front of the building to secure it for me. Despite how busy it was I didn't get the feeling of being rushed or watched over. To me it is the perfect kind of place to go of an afternoon an spend a few hours catching up with friends.",

I've only had coffee and some of their superb pastries here, but the dinner menu looks fantastic as well. Its reasonably priced too, and is the perfect place for dinner in an elegant and comfortable environment. They can get rather busy on the weekends for lunch, and some of the staff are a tad haughty. Oh well, we won't hold it against them, the environment makes up for any lack of hospitality. There is free Wifi as well, provided though all of Upper Street by Islington's local council.",

The omlettes looked good, and the big english breakfast looked safe. i have to say that the cappucino/latte was DE-LI-SHOUS :)))Lovely spot with lovely looking attendants, and on a sunny day it's really just the spot to try mediterranean goods (steer away from the meats).",

    "text": "We were off to meet our friends in a nearby pub, so we walked along Upper Street checking out our dining options via the window menus. We saw a lot of interesting menus, but we wanted to see what else we could find... until we saw the Fig & Olive menu.Inside, we found a quaint yet romantic restaurant. The tables and chairs were quite close together, but this London and space is limited. The back is reminiscent of a French solarium with the brick walls and glass ceiling. There is a long heavy wooden table. The top is a lovely whitewashed grey and the legs are a whitewashed mint green. It would be perfect for a nice meal out with a group of 10-12.We ordered the Mix Vegetarian Meze Platter, which contained 3 pieces of pita (a bit skimpy in my opinion, but since this was a starter, I got over it... especially after tasting what was on the plate). It came with hummus, chili ezme salad, an eggplant ratatouille, a small spring salad with balsamic glaze and roasted halloumi cheese. I had no idea what ezme was, but it was like a mediterranean salsa, with the chunky tomatoes, onions and lemon juice (I think). My husband isn't a fan of hummus. I've had him try a few kinds and he just doesn't care for it. Upon trying the hummus at Fig & Olive, I was torn. It was the absolute best hummus I've ever had... I wanted it all to myself, but when you love someone, you share what you love. I told him he should try it, and he really liked it, also. I will go back and get an order of hummus. Possibly just get it to go so no one has to see me eat the entire thing. Chris noted that the halloumi was the best he's tasted.Chris ordered the Roasted Aubergine and Goat Cheese dish. The Eggplant was stuffed with mushroom, fresh pepper, onion & herbs, with rice on the side and topped with caramelised goat cheese. It came on the plate looking quite a bit like fish, which as non fish eaters, we found a bit off putting, but it was really really nice. Again, they did the cheese very well.I opted for the Asparagus and Spinach Risotto. The rice was cooked beautifully, the asparagus was tender, and the spinach and parmesan were nice additions. The rocket and balsamic glaze on top was just the perfect thing. They added just a hint of unique flavour to a great dish.We will definitely be going back. I expect that we'll be back many times.",

It was cooked just right, with the perfect texture that is just a slight crunch. The sauce was not overpowering to the prawn's own freshness.For entr\u00e9e I ordered the cod, which was slightly overcooked. The portion was generous though. I liked the sauce for the cod, but it did not penetrate to the center of the fish, which was slightly bland. My friend ordered the sea bass, and the spinach that came with the dish was delicious and a good compliment to the fish. The skin provided a good counter texture to the fish, which was also cooked just right.For dessert we ordered waffles, and the waffles (recommended by friend) were the reasons we came to Fig and Olive. I had the one with chocolate sauce with ice cream, and it was delicious but not as much as the one my friend ordered - raspberry sauce.I wish I had discovered this place earlier so that I could have had the opportunity to return, but I guess I will just have to wait until I come back for a visit.",

    "text": "My partner and I have only visited this place once and will never go back. I can therefore only comment on our experience, but I can say I'm shocked that some people have given an excellent 5 star review. In my opinion the service was the only glimmer of hope for this restaurant, oh and maybe the rosemary and chilli infused olives we shared for starters. Our other starter was cheap, recently defrosted, white baguette with a thin veneer of acrid garlic paste. Not a great start. Drinks were not great either. the water and beer we were served were poured, out of sight, from bottles at the bar. This seems suspiciously odd, when most restaurants pour at the table enabling the diner to see the labels and know the products are fresh. This should have been a sign.We opted for the specials board over the set menu. Roasted Lamb Shank with Mash Potatoes and Aubergines for her and Wild Smoked Haddock in a Hollandaise Sauce with Green Beans and Mash for me. Both dishes were repulsive. First things first, the Lamb didn't taste like Lamb, the sauce was a funny artificial colour and was strangely reminiscent of Heinz BBQ sauce. I ate a lot of this, too much to complain convincingly about afterwards, not so the Haddock. With it's top hat of leathery skin and texture like an old plimsole, not even the sulphurous yellow hollandaise sauce could rescue it. What a shame, and it wasn't cheap. \u00a311 may not buy much in restaurants around Angel, but it buys a packet of Birds Eye Fish Fingers, and I'd reluctantly prefer the latter any day of the week. We complained because it was obvious from the full plates we were unhappy. This was met with shock, and thankfully a reduction in the price of the bill. We didn't pay for the Haddock, even though the waiter insisted it was freshly caught 24 hours ago. Pollocks.We didn't have desserts, for obvious reasons, but they looked appetising. A coffee and a cake might have been a wiser decision.",

Given the plethora of places to swallow coffee and cake you need to keep at the top of your and your neighbours game. So when we strolled into the doppleganger interior of Fig and Olive and paid 13 quid for two coffees and a couple of cake slices you want the best. The very best. Weak luke warm coffee, an over sweet lemon meringue pie and a slightly too dry huge chocolate brownie. Server good, food bad.",

Do they roofie the food so you'll come back?Two words that will change your life... Mashed. Potatoes. Boy howdy, do Fig and Olive know how to mash a potato? And I didn't even order it, I just couldn't keep my fork out of someone else's plate. I walk by all the time and their selection of insanely amazing cakes always draws my eye. So finally I dragged Laura N. in for dinner and since we both weren't drinking, we decided to eat everything. Their stuffed aubergine was cheesy and delicious, but it was the baked cod with mash that made me see nirvana. The hollandaisey style sauce was so creamy and satisfying it was an orgasm on a plate. Only low point was that they forgot my fries and by the time they arrived, I was Joey-fat-pants full.. but they never charged for them, so that is nice service. No room for cake, in the immortal words of Arnie... I'll be back. P.s I forgot to mention the decor is so cool and chilled out, but again, food amnesia, I only saw mash.",

You have to search in unexpected places, but seek and you shall find, as we did at Fig & Olive.Frankly, neither figs nor olives really whet my brunch appetite, but upon first glance at the neighboring ginormous plates of sausage, hash browns, eggs and toast, I knew I would be in for something delicious. Coffee? Fantastic. Definitely a good start. When my plate of food arrived, I was presented with a veritable bouquet of wheat toast, fluffy scrambled eggs, and blossom of pink smoked salmon in the center. \u00a0At that point, all conversation devolved into a cacophony of forks to plates and mmms and ahhhs. Maybe weekend brunch isn't shining in full glory as it does in the states, but no one bothered telling Fig & Olive. Regardless, a line of patrons out the door proved that brunch culture can (and should) be alive and well in London. Bring on the brunch!",

Located at the end of Upper Street, this wonderful restaurant ticks all the right boxes for a Saturday morning meet.It was super busy but I managed to secure a table pretty quickly - on looking at the menu, it is somewhat overwhelming with a combination of good British breakfast choices in addition to some more Mediterranean type dishes. I actually thought it was just a cafe so ate breakfast beforehand, but I suddenly found myself being eyed up by the 2 big (huge) and delicious looking breakfasts served to the gents next to us. Instead I safely opted for a filter coffee (note to self; never eat breakfast before coming here or cut your losses and prepare for a 'fat' day). My friend had the salmon and scrambled eggs which she can vouch was rather yummy, healthy and filling. My only 'complaint' was that after our drinks and food, we were asked to move tables to accommodate some people who had been waiting twenty minutes to be seated. This seemed a little odd considering we wanted to order a further round of coffees and if I had been in a worse mood, I may have been more annoyed but hey, the coffee was excellent, food great and the atmosphere buzzy. On our way out, I couldn't help but notice the gorgeous and decadent looking cakes and desserts on display - it was so busy I didn't stop to sample but definitely maybe next time......",

Fair enough, so we tried again, this time making sure that the offer went through. However, she refused to honour it, and even told us to \"look at the computer and see that it didn't go through.\" Then she berated us for trying again, saying that she \"has to pay 2 pounds each time she gets a booking through that app\". Just felt the customer service was pretty disappointing. The thing is, the food was fine. Mains were good portion wise, I got a steak. Small portions with the apps and quite pricey overall.

We were sat at the very front of the shop by the door. The waiters were very friendly and took our order within about 5 minutes. The menu had a variety of different foods to suit different times of the day. I went for a 'light lunch' and ordered the chicken quesadilla and halloumi. The prices were very reasonable for Upper Street at approximately \u00a36.50-8.50 for a meal.I was a bit disappointed when my partners food came out first and it was about 5 minutes before I received my food - they even forgot the halloumi! Aside from the slight mishap, the food was yummy! I can confidently say this restaurant is good for buggies as the waiter was very happy to rearrange some sofas in order to get the baby in!Despite the slight hiccup with the halloumi, I would recommend The Fig and Olive for a light and a nice atmosphere.",

They were very apologetic when theh served my Mum her moussaka as it \u00a0was on the small side. When they had cooked a new batch they presented her with a second plate of moussaka and salad!! The desserts were ok, but not very fresh tasting, and my red velvet cake a little dry at the edges. The lemon tart was pretty tasty though!",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high - a friend told me this was her favorite restaurant in London. I was underwhelmed. The menu was a mishmash if different cuisines. I had the moussaka and my dining companion had the coq au vin. We shared three of the starters, all deep fried. Nothing was bad but nothing particularly stood out either. Portion sizes were quite large, especially the chicken. I might come back to try the desserts but not sure if it will be soon though.",

    "text": "Something at Fig + Olive doesn't quite do it for me but it is hard for me to explain just what that is.The food here is certainly good. Hummus started its redemption with me at this restaurant. On my recent visit i enjoyed the Pumpkin, butternut squash + manchego cheese soup. The goats cheese + aubergine risotto is a trusty main course. The desserts look. A-MAZE-ZING as you arrive and leave, but I never have room to test them on my not particularly sweet tooth.I keep thinking that they don't have much choice. Its true that I don't eat much meat, but they have like half a dozen vegetarian options. I think that I have this impression means that not many of the choices particularly appeal to me.There was an order mix up on my last visit with some confusion over the soup of the day. Turns out there were two different soups of the day and this ended with us getting both...and another starter we had ordered. But we got the extra accidental starter for free so that really removes the reason to complain.I think perhaps it is just a little classy for me. It is quite posh and a little more expensive than my usual meals. There is nothing wrong with the food but none of the main courses get my mouth watering and make me excited to order. It is all quite tightly packed together in a small space (the chairs and tables, not the food).But I think the problem may be more mine than the restaurant. My rating feels a little harsh but I gots to go with my gut.",

As I hadn't been to the area for ages I was keen to try a genuine Islington institution in favour of the many chains outlets.I just love afternoon tea and was drawn in by the tempting display of cakes, even though they all look a bit on the heavy side. I opted for a brulee cheesecake which was served lovingly decorated. Sadly, this was just too sugary even for my sweet tooth.",

Followed it with 'Falafel the Fig and Olive Way', which is essentially a few pieces of falafel in a yummy tomato-vegetable concoction. Falafel itself was nice and crispy, reasonable by UK standards. For dessert we had ice cream on a hot waffle with a delicious raspberry coulis. They also have an impressive display of other desserts - all sorts of luxurious cakes, Sicilian cannoli, and so on.",

Upper street is crawling with restaurants, bakeries and cafes these days, but Fig and Olive is a real standout for it's delicious food, reasonable prices and adorable atmosphere. \u00a0Breakfast/brunch here is great value, with meals between \u00a36-13. \u00a0I've had the veggie full breakfast (all great minus one kind of dodgy vegetarian sausage), the Halloumi Salad, and most recently, the pancakes with bacon - all so yum! \u00a0Clean, bright space, with friendly staff and strong coffee make for a great place to spend a lazy Sunday morning/afternoon.This will continue to be a top choice for me!",

It was warm, creamy and nicely seasoned, with a lot of great textures. \u00a0Yum. It's definitely an easy weekend brunch and lunch spot.",

We started (as I always do) with the deep fried camembert, and also had the hummous, which were both great. For mains, I tried the lamb steak, and the friend had the shin of pork, which were delicious. I've always been happy with the service, and find that the prices are really reasonable for what you get (considering the neighbourhood). I'll undoubtedly be back again soon.",
