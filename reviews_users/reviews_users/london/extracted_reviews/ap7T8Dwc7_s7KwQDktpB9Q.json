    "text": "I really want to give this 5 stars but I just can't! I can't honestly even give it 4 stars...The atmosphere is awesome. That gets 5 stars.The concept is also awesome. Another 5 star item.The execution is almost awesome. It could do with a roof for when it rains but both times I've been there (yesterday for dinner and today for lunch) it's been really nice and sunny so no complaint from me. It just wouldn't be an option in the rain.So how come it drops 2 stars?Mainly because it's supposed to be street food, so I kind of expect to pay street prices. Instead you get quite small portions for anything between \u00a35-10 a pop. In other words, proper restaurant prices. Some of the food is great and some is mediocre. I fully intend to try as many things here as I can, despite what I think of the pricing, because I would rather my money goes to these vendors than to Pret or Itsu...Ok so why isn't it at least 4 stars, you may be wondering? Simple. \u00a35 for a small can of beer.The atmosphere is also ever so slightly spoiled by the presence of bouncers and security guards. Honestly, do they think people are going to start squatting here or something?Anyway, despite the 3 stars it's definitely worth a visit! If enough of the places turn out to be great I'll up my rating to 4 stars but the prices need to come down a bit for it to get 5...",

Though I was disappointed that there were so few decorations in the dungeon and slightly disturbed by the iconography I enjoyed the drinks. I had my first mulled wine of the season in the Alpine bar, toasting my tush by the stove after having sat out in the cold for a little too long. All the stalls were reasonably priced and it was fairly bustling though not too busy (at least in my opinion) the doughnut stall was very generous with their chocolate sauce. Of all the street food venues I have been to this has the nicest toilets.",

    "text": "I've been a big fan of the Street Feast events for a while now and I have to say that this one was probably the most disappointing.Venue wise it is pretty good, especially when the sun is shining although the top deck does get very busy so make sure you get there early to grab a good spot. Getting around downstairs gets a little tricky when it fills up and the people hanging around the bar area make getting served a bit of a challenge sometimes.For me however the thing that lets it down the most was the food vendor selection. There's definitely less choice than usual and the traders that are there don't seem to be of the usual standard. Breddo's Tacos was something I'd been looking forward to for a long time but ended up being a huge disappointment. The only saving grace was Chuck Burger and I'd definitely like to try their new chicken burger.In future I think I'll just stick to Street Feast in Dalston",

    "text": "Continuing to transform derelict spaces into eating experiences and blur the lines between restaurants and street food, Street Feast bring us Dinerama. A giant outdoor diner/food market that sits somewhere between fine dining and a music festival. At Shoreditch Yard, it's the perfect (although pretty hidden) location for city boys and hipsters alike, though you'll see more of the latter. The better news is that unlike other Street Feasts, Dinerama is open midweek, and at lunch. So not only can you grab delectable dinner and drinks at the weekend, you can ditch your al desko work lunch for some al fresco fun. With two levels, six bars and 15 street food vendors, you'll be spoilt for choice, and if you don't know where to start, Yum Bun (especially for veggies) or Smokestak won't disappoint. The split-levels and separate areas mean there's more chance of nabbing a seat or a good sunspot to perch in, but be prepared for queues (there's a customer capacity of 1000). There's no doubting this is big. Big for our bellies. And big for London's street food scene.",

I do think the \u00a33 entry fee was a little much for a Thursday evening but hey ho!I started with a beef taco from Breddos, which was spicier than I was expecting and great fun to eat because it was so messy (they give you kitchen roll to help with that!). I then moved on to a frozen Margarita from the big bar, which was delicious, strong-tasting and refreshing. With a cute little cocktail umbrella :) Next stop was Yum Bun for a pork belly bun - I should have thought (clue is in the name really), but the pork was basically fat and I really don't enjoy that. But I LOVE soft buns and the additions to the meat were really tasty - I wish they had had a beef or chicken option. My final port of call was of course dessert - and what better than a \"You Doughnut\" special of their bite-size, freshly cooked doughnuts, cinnamon sugar, salted caramel sauce & pecans. With a scoop of hazelnut icecream of course! Mmmmm hot doughnuts, sickly sweet sauce and melty nutty icecream. Food heaven! Unfortunately served with a fork rather than a spoon, which isn't great for scooping up the melted icecream and sauce remnants once the doughnits are gone... but I just drank it from the cup :pI went by myself and was hoping to get chatting to other people who were visiting Dinerama, but unfortunately if you are by yourself you might as well be invisible! This is why I dropped a star, but it doesn't matter because next time I will definitely take a group of friends and make a night of it!",

It just felt more buzzing too. We stayed downstairs, and it got chilly, so my advice is to layer up. (Or drink more.) We tried and failed to persuade our group to move upstairs to the far cosier bar.Food-wise, get the beef pontine - it's five-star street food. Juicy, flavourful beef over chips. What's not to love? The donuts were also cracking, available with salted caramel or peanut chocolate sauce. As others mentioned, get there as early as you can - the queue gets longer and longer post 7.30pm.",

While it rained on our second day, we still made our own fun - so much so we ended up staying there for 4 hours (I blame the great prices on frozen rose wine and bottles of prosecco upstairs for under 30 euros.) The place was pretty young (20s-30s), diverse, international and laid back and boasts a variety of food/drink options, as well as a ton of seating - you can take any of your things to one of the communal tables, bar stools, or up to the roof areas. We didn't eat or come at night so would definitely come back the next time I'm in London.

Street food is a great thing, small entrepreneurs testing out the waters and being able to get their wares to people with a much lower outlay of capital than the renting of premises and outfitting a kitchen and dining room.And I'm not knocking the food itself, the 3 dishes we tried were really good, Yum Bun coming through with their wonderful hirata style buns (better than BAO in my opinion). And the fresh calamari were good (although quickly turned cold in the breeze). The Poutine was... not poutine... Really good sweet potato fries and gravy, but just wasn't Poutine without cheese curds. But that's not the problem.The venue is good, and crowded and busy but things flow, food doesn't take too long, and the bar is quite quick moving. A lot of effort has been put into keeping the areas free of rubbish and making sure that each vendor has a decent space to operate out of. The food is reasonably/slightly unreasonably priced and the portions aren't really geared for ordering more than 2 dishes per person, each being a dish (Except for Bao which sells by the bun). But it is good so you don't mind stuffing your face. What is a bit galling though is the price of alcohol. It's there that you can really see where they are making their money...1 evening there amount to about \u00a340 including the entrance fee, not breaking the bank but on my way home I did wonder exactly where all of my money went...",

There is a good amount of seating, the atmosphere is casual, there are tons of options for food so everyone can have something different, and it wasn't too difficult to get a drink.I had a slider at BOB's lobster that was delicious. For the price of the slider, it wasn't a lot but it was lobster after all. The taste was great though! There is a good amount of food booths here with a lot of variety so you could make many trips without frequenting the same establishments. We grabbed a table and spent several hours there socializing and having drinks. It's a really great spot for day drinking that may or may not go into the evening. I'd love to go back again soon!",

We were looking for the Box Park and I had bookmarked this from the fearless leaders feed (always a source of inspiration). When I saw it I exclaimed \"Oh I know this!\" I felt good as my 20 year old son had never heard of it.I like this Dinerama. It was thirty degrees and possibly the last hot day of summer and the place was stoked. There is a downstairs bit with two main drinks areas (both do beers but one also had a bent on cocktails). There were also tons of food stalls-the sizzling smell of burning meat was pretty intoxicating. Sadly we had just eaten so couldn't partake. There is also a terrace of sorts running upstairs. It reminded me a little of a set from a production of West Side story-all rickety rails and iron staircasing-very industrial and with lots of character. We got two cans of Camden Ale (a round \u00a310-ouch!) and sat upstairs watching the hipsters. A really great place to come and relax and frankly spend a whole day should you wish.Tip-there is a small bar upstairs that it much less busy than those downstairs.",

Eat as much as you like for less than a sit down meal at a fancy gaff!! Winner winner for me! Great for dates, with mates, on a night out. The best thing is they close at midnight too!!!",

We don't have pop ups like this is America so this is something totally rad and unique and they do a job well done with the cocktails and the food selection. I personally love the pizza station and the wing lab. Yes, this place is a bit overpriced and it sucks that they charge cover after a certain time but really you're paying for the experience. Love the shipping container vibe and the casual atmosphere as well. Definitely a great shout for a casual evening on a thursday or Friday. I recommend getting there early before the crowds appear so you can enjoy the different food spots and grab a pint or cocktail before the lines get crazy.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday a while back mostly because I wanted to try something different and thought this kind of set up would be best for the occasion. It's an interesting idea, a bunch of little stands selling different kinds of food and drink and large spaces for people to sit or stand while eating and drinking. The food while expensive was at least tasty, though I wish there was a bit more variety. I think there were nearly as many drink places as food places, which I think is a bit much. More food than drink I say! There was also only really one place to get sweet food or dessert and it was a doughnut shop that also had ice cream. So if you don't want or can't have either, you're stuck. All in all it was a fun time and the food was good but I'm not sure I'd return. I'd probably want to check out their other locations that are only open on the weekends as they seem to have a greater variety in food!!!",

    "text": "I'm often weary of places that seemingly offer everything, and while Dinerama is without question a fantastic spot to drink and eat away an afternoon and evening regardless of culinary preference, I simply didn't find that they executed anything in a way that was better than anything else you can find among the infinitely competitive London dining scene. \u00a0Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Dinerama is seemingly always crowded so long as the weather holds up, and during my visit on a warm and sunny Saturday early evening it was packed shoulder to shoulder. Even so, each establishment deals with their lines in short order, so I didn't have to wait more than ten minutes for a dish. Of note is that they charge seven pounds after 1900, and that can result in a huge line just to get in. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Prices are affordable all around at Dinerama, and my Fried Chicken bun was four pounds - a good deal considering the size of the bun. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?My Fried Chicken bun was just okay, and after sampling a slider, a donut, and some pizza, I came to the conclusion that everything was just okay. That's not a bad thing - variety is the spice of life, but I wouldn't expect to be blown away. The fried chicken in my bun was mostly just fried breading, and the actual bao fell apart the second I picked it up. The flavor was there but buried under mounds of lettuce and mayo. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Jack of all trades master of none. I can't say I would. No Star Granted.",

    "text": "You can never know quite what to expect in a place like Shoreditch aside expect the unexpected. SOO when I heard news of a similar boxpark-esque street food hub, I was raring to go! Shoreditch to me is like an urban abandoned jungle which has been given a new leash of life from shoreditchians (totally made that word up but hoping it'll start a trend!). From this I learnt that even the most unattractive of buildings can be beautiful masterpieces. You therefore learn to embrace all forms, shapes and sizes. This is what I came across from the entry point of Dinerama, a mish mash architectural building resembling something like a large shed. It felt a lot like the Harry Potter's Weasley's house (in my mind). Very makeshift but done lovingly so.What I particularly love about street food is that you're not limited to eating at one establishment. For someone who eats alot, this was the perfect place to cram in as much food as possible and eat it in one sitting. At the forefront, Dinerama looks like a disused scrapyard with a tiny entrance which could've easily been overlooked. Dotted around are bonfire garbage cans similar to what homeless people use. In a way, it added to the shabbyness of it, which is arty for some, but trashy for others. Excuse the pun *cough cough*. However don't let the cover of the book deceive you as with all things Shoreditch, the people, the community transforms it into a loving welcoming home. Sitting opposite the Dinerama entrance lies a building with two train carriages nestled at the top. #onlyinshoreditchThe staff standing outside welcomed us warmly (something which I struggled to find in London so it was a pleasant surprise to receive such friendly service). Dinerama was actually much bigger than it looked and bustling as well, especially for a Thursday evening! Imagine what Friday might bring! Any thoughts of Boxpark being better than Dinerama were soon dashed out the window as we entered a large hall with food stalls lining two sides. Honestly words don't do this place justice as the ambience was fantastic, the food was marvellous with plenty of choices. At first I thought the bars lined one side and the food, the other but I was wrong as I was told upstairs... yes there is an upstairs... housed a bar pub like area with plenty of cushy seating areas. It just felt so surreal as I can never imagine Boxpark being this grand. I also know that as a tip, you can gauge how good an establishment is by checking out their loos and in Boxpark there aren't any loos but in Dinerama ... Wow! The loos were plentiful and they had working sinks! \u00a0I had actually expected portable loo style bogs but I was pleasantly surprised. I just felt Dinerama really caters for their customers and I felt cared for. Downstairs with the food stalls, there were plenty of benches and seating areas too and when it came to being weather proof, Dinerama wins hands down, as the food hall is an indoor structure with glass ceilings. I only managed to try the Yum Bun pork buns and chicken (Probably the best things I've ever tried) and the doughnut ice cream (honeycomb ice cream with salted caramel and doughnuts). I wish my stomach was bigger because I would really like to tackle more choices :DI love street food and this has officially made it to the top of my list!!",

    "text": "The concept of street food markets appeal to my indecisive and gluttonous nature and Dinerama is one of my choice spots in East London. It's perfect for grazing on perfectly turned out foodie titbits and some killer cocktails. Admittedly, drinking at all of the Street Feast iterations can be a tad costly, but it's the food and the environs that you get in return for a marked up beer. Decked out with plenty of seating running down the central area downstairs- plus there's plenty more tables upstairs. These are better for those who don't relish the unrelenting temptation posed by staring down the barrel of a gun- that is, being surrounded by the vendors and engulfed in the aromas, action and the continuous stream of people sauntering by with a 'look at the size of my pizza' smugness. You will be forever hungry if you sit downstairs.The crowds are always media types from the local area mixed with the most intrepid tourists- it gets extremely packed and queues are inevitable everywhere after 7pm on a Friday or Saturday night. I recently visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon and it was both relaxed and uncrowded, which made for a pleasant few drinks with friends.The selection of vendors is good- perhaps not as good as Dalston Yard, in my opinion- but I can't fault Breddo's tacos and Yum Bun ever (available at both locations) and I really love Birdbox, the chicken-centric brethren of Smokestak. The birdbox meal is always a guaranteed pleaser, coming with a beautifully moist and generous portion of Baja chicken with golden dripping roasties and a kick of heat. Last visit, I tried Farang- Thai street food purveyors whose crispy noodle salmon salad is legendary- and opted for the fish balls with a side of roti and pickles. Three large fish balls were fried to perfection, each one a crispy cherry bomb of explosive Thai flavour. They were seriously good, with lovely fish flavours seeping through and crumbly interior and that sneaking heat that you get with balanced Thai cuisine. Swimming in a sweet chili sauce, they were moreish and surprisingly satisfying.The Farang curries also each looked like an appetising plate- including the chicken marinated in green thai paste and served on a bed of steamed jasmine rice. There was also a peach massaman curry that I sampled eagerly and it had a sweet, mellow heat that was fantastic.Dinerama is a venue that will always live up to culinary expectations and is a perfect way to kick-start a night out or the weekend. On a warm evening, you can't do any better than a great laidback environment, food flying out and a series of bars to cater to your every need. Needless to say, it's always a struggle to leave.",

Well Dinerama's got it! Dinerama, like the other Street Feast sites, is rustic with cool vibes and coooool decor but also that bit plusher - with a beautiful wine bar (Winerama) up the top with the best view over the rest of Dinerama, the Zephyr Lounge with balcony views, open spaces and comfy leather sofas and the Bamboo Hut perfect for booking out for small private functions. They also have a large indoor bar (Dick's Magic T-bar) that is heated keeping you dry on those typical English summer days and serves the infamous toffee vodka shots (a must try!). Basically you can stay below in the \"food pit\" gorging yourself on food or come up to the light, bright bars and get your drink on (or do both?!). There are also a few bars downstairs - The Big Bar (serving Big Cocktails at a whopping \u00a310 each along with a \u00a320 cocktail in a watermelon) and German Sex Dungeon (serving crafts cans - watch out for the dildos hanging from the ceiling!).On to the food! With over 10 food vendors there is plenty of choice for everyone and some of the street food staples have set up shop - Smokestak, YumBun and Breddos Tacos. Others include BBQ lab (chicken wings), BirdBox (rotisserie chicken) and Cheeky Italian. I can highly recommend Smokestak and Breddos (their 3 tacos for \u00a39 is a must) but still need to work my way round other stalls including Cheeky Italian, Fundi Pizza and You Doughnut (Hot doughnut bites, with ice cream and sauce - mmmm). Once you have grabbed your nosh from which ever place you fancy there are long communal tables in the middle to meet up, pop yourself down and gobble up your food before moving on to the next drink or food stall.Dinerama is open from on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 5pm until late. Entry is free before 7pm and \u00a33 after that so make sure you get there early and stay late!",

The layout is good, there's communal tables, barrels to lean upon and plenty of toilets! Plus an outdoor spot for smoking. Food-wise, we tried the duck burger and the lamb, both were good, the lamb overpriced for the portion. Also tried scallops and cauliflower cheese, salmon tartare in prawn crackers and fried prawns in Mayo. Aside from the prawns drowning in a super spicy mayo, flavours were fine, well conceived but a touch pricey. Then again, maybe I just expected more/better. The doughnuts were good! Overall, this is a poor replacement for Dalston's Street Feast, definitely not worth travelling across London, nor the \u00a33 entry charge after 7pm. But if you work nearby, it's worth a stop.",

But Dinerama seems to have solved all those problems, and more! Dinerama is an indoor heated space with about 10 different delicious food and drink vendors. There's loads of space to move around and plenty of tables and chairs. We ordered the chicken and pork bao, duck foie gras burger, fried scallops, beef poutine, mojo chicken wings, and doughnuts and ice cream for dessert. So basically from nearly every store hoho. Some things definitely stood out more than others i.e.The duck fois gras burger - everyone needs to try this RIGHT NOW! But some where disappointingly average I.e. The chicken wings which just tasted like sweet and sour chicken.There were no lines and always somewhere to sit or lean on. And the cocktails were huge (in beer sized plastic cups) so we didn't have to top up as often. Way to go Dinerama! You are killing it.",

My favourite was the foiegras burger from Duck N Roll with it's succulent beef patty and foiegras that melts in your mouth, it's divine! The yum bun was a popular shop too; the pork is soft and juicy but it's quite filling so don't go crazy with it.The 'you doughnut' shop was a delight, they make the dough from scratch there and fry it fresh. I tried the cinnamon doughnut with honeycomb ice cream and caramel sauce, amazing. Definitely want to go back to this buzzing place to try more!",

The layout the way they measured prosecco before pouring it into my glass....I mean.. WHO MEASURES PROSECCO!!!!!!??!!Not great value with drinks as I sampled a few and none were good nor worth the price... However my fav breddos tacos were there so at least the world was right. Won't come back here to be fair but the tacos are still deeeeeeeeeeelish",

The staff at the front could be a bit more friendly. They were a bit rude and more keen on collecting the entrance fee than trying to be welcoming.",
