    "text": "the food was good. The sticky date which another Yelp'er claimed to be excellent was not so good. Not terrible but it had very little dates and tasted strangely smokey. The service and environment was poor to unacceptable. The first ting I noticed was that the kitchen staff (Chef?) who work the grill (which is in plain sight) do not wear any sort of head covering. I find this odd. I guess in the UK it does not matter if hair or dead skin falls into your dishes. In addition to the lack of proper head attire, the head chef kept throwing his dirty pans into a metal bin on the floor which made this very annoying, very loud noise that echoed through the front seating area. I realise he is busy but when the staff give him looks of WTF are you doing you'd think he would stop. Nope! Maybe it is the norm in London, but all the staff (expect for the manager) were not friendly and borderline rude. If do end up going, sit downstairs. I, however, would do not recommend this place.",

    "text": "In researching food options for this trip, it struck me as fascinating that some of the restaurants highlighting seasonal British food are simply named after their location. \u00a0Hereford Road, Great Queen Street, etc. \u00a0So it was on a Sunday evening that I found myself in this posh neighborhood, on the quite street that is Hereford Road.The restaurant is in a former butcher shop. \u00a0A stack of rustic bread sat invitingly inside the huge plate glass window. \u00a0Once inside, the open kitchen with gleaming white tiles said welcome like nothing else could. \u00a0This is where it all happens. \u00a0Opposite the kitchen is a wall-length banquette of semi-circular red leather seats with little round bistro tables. \u00a0Am I at a milonga in Buenos Aires, waiting for the show to begin? \u00a0The host led us down a few steps to the main dining room in the rear. \u00a0There were giant red leather booths on one side, and a scattering of wood tables and chairs in the rest of the room. \u00a0A humongous circular sky light dominated the middle of the room. \u00a0At high noon, I cannot imagine anyone sitting underneath it like ants under a giant magnifying glass.The menu was a single sheet of paper, printed in utilitarian font, listing the day's bounty. \u00a0We kicked off the evening with a bottle of Col Vetoraz Prosecco di Valdobbiadene. \u00a0For starters, we had Chilled Pea & Lovage Soup, and Grilled Razor Clams, Red Onions, & Savory. \u00a0The soup was a refreshing starter. \u00a0Sweet creamy peas with hits of astringency from the lovage. \u00a0The razor clam was my #1 favorite starter for this whole trip. \u00a0They were gigantic, at least 8 inches (see pic on my profile). \u00a0They were sweeter than the sweetest of squid, crab, and lobster combined. \u00a0A faint smokiness from the grill, and punches of assertiveness from the red onion, herb, and heavily garlic-flavored oil. \u00a0For our mains, Baked Brill, Cucumber, Kohlrabi, Brown Shrimps, and Guinea Fowl, Lentils, Sweet Corn, Foie Gras. \u00a0Brill is like a turbot. \u00a0In my opinion, more like a little stingray. \u00a0Very tender mild flesh. \u00a0Small brown shrimps seem to be de rigueur with any kind of fish preparation. \u00a0The warm salad of cucumber pieces and julienned kohlrabi gave it a nice crunch. \u00a0The guinea fowl was nicely roasted with crispy skin. \u00a0For a split second I had a vision that I might have shot it myself earlier in the day. \u00a0The ragout of lentil and corn was an interesting mix. \u00a0The heartiness of lentils combined with the freshness of corn. \u00a0Will definitely try this at home. \u00a0For pudding, Eton Mess sounded beguiling enough. \u00a0Fresh strawberries, meringue, clotted cream, all whipped together into a mess. \u00a0Whatever food fight it was that gave birth to this dish, thank you boys!Why 4 stars? \u00a0Utter simplicity, but not to the extreme. \u00a0Very nice charming place. \u00a0An ideal neighborhood restaurant. \u00a0Now, how much does one of those white town houses go for?",

Fantastic value set lunches during the week and a menu that won't break the bank anyway, mean this is an incredibly neighbourhood-friendly bistrot. I love seeing unusual and/old fashioned herbs on the menu so was instantly drawn to the mussels with leek and savoury. They were well-seasoned and in a moreish buttered and wined up stock that had me using the soup spoon. The bread did not appear to be from St John Bread & Wine, however was crusty and good and perfect for mopping up juices that my spoon couldn't quite pick up. I can also recommend the onglet with chips. See now, this is great bistrot food. Thick, three-times cooked chips saw me eat the lot against my better judgement and the steak was perfectly cooked and tasty as that cut should be. An interesting and well-priced wine list is worth sampling from - there are some unusual wines in there so definitely ask to taste and to be guided. Can I eat there again tomorrow?",

    "text": "Just adding a note to last year's experience - and I've downgraded it a bit....If this was a review about the sticky date pudding - it would be five stars, no problem. It has to be London's best - soft, rich, super moist and a lake of really dark, delicious sauce. But other than pud, I felt rather, well, neglected at Hereford Road last night. I've always loved it before - and I'd had to charge 12 miles around London during the day because of the tube strike chaos, so I was really ready for a decent meal. First off, they forgot to bring any bread. All the other tables got some. But although they warned out mains would take at least 15 minutes, we didn't get anything to tide us over. Then, the vegetarian dish. C'mon, guys! I mean, I know you're famous for your meat and all, but you could vary the thing SLIGHTLY. In two years. Barley, pumpkin, goats cheese. Not so much. I've had it 4 times now, the first time it was pretty good, the second time mushy, the third time dry, this time just bland. Did you forget the seasoning? What's wrong with - say - offering some lentils and girolles, which were on the menu alongside the duck? Anyway, just a thought.Oh, and my chunk of pudding was gorgous, but way smaller than the girl on the next table. Just saying.",

I was so surprised and impressed with this place. Although some of the items on the menu seemed bizarre and daunting, I absolutely loved everything I tried. All the produce and ingredients were absolutely fresh. Hereford Road's menu changes based on the produce available to them which is a farmers market/farm-to-table quality I feel I rarely see outside of California. The actual restaurant contrasts greatly with its traditional food - the place is very modern with lots of steel and sharp accents - which creates a really great juxtaposition to its location in town home. Among the food highlights were the terrine pate, the rabbit, the steak, slip soles and the mullet (no I don't mean the hairstyle). Their desserts were also delicious - the chocolate cake was to die for. The wine list was also very good and affordable. In fact, the entire meal was surprisingly affordable considering how great the quality of the food was! The staff was incredible friendly and helpful as well. I would definitely love to come back here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good English meal! The space is relatively small so book in advance if you have a large group.",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full review, with pictures, please see here: laissezfare.wordpress.co\u2026 \u00a0HEREFORD ROAD - A ST JOHN FOR THE WEST SIDE? Our new local? As is the wont these days, Hereford Road operates an A4 single-sheet menu that allegedly changes each day according to what's fresh in the kitchen (FYI \u00a0the daily menu is also updated on their website). Think St John, Bocca di Luppo, Great Queen Street, etc. It's a great concept in theory, especially for a place purporting to be a 'local' restaurant, as the 'local' customers can come back often and never get bored. I have to admit I was quite intrigued by some of the choices on offer when we went on a Thursday night in mid-December. There were some very interesting dishes, including a few things I'd never even heard of before, and I know a bit about offal. I was particularly intrigued to hear our waiter describe the process of making 'Bath Chap', and decided I had to have some of that after understanding what it was and how it's prepared. The simple explanation is that it is a particular piece of pork from the lower cheek of pigs from the Wilthshire/Somerset area; it is fully de-boned, then placed in brine, then usually cooked in breadcrumbs \u00a0at Hereford Road they also add some 'aromatic herbs', but they wouldn't tell me which ones (even when I asked the chef on the way out). But enough about particular piggies from Bath. The four of us eventually decided on our dishes and began the waiting game. As we relaxed in our spacious booth, we attempted to talk over the very large table to our left, which must have been an office out on their Christmas party. I have to say that while the design of the restaurant is very nice \u00a0replete with red leather booths and simple yet smart tables, color schemes and furnishings \u00a0the acoustics are pretty atrocious on a busy night like the one on which we visited. As we tried to hear each other, a waiter brought out some bread, which was of the soft white loaf variety, and while freshly baked was not particularly memorable. Starter 1: Lamb Breast, Laverbread & OatmealMy starter of lamb breast was a new dish for me. The lamb breast (or brisket) had been cooked inside a fried oatmeal crust which had laverbread mixed into it. The flavor combination was bold but worked well, with the fairly strong lamb taste being offset by the fried oatmeal and the mineral, sea flavors of the laverbread (think oysters). Not something you eat every day, but not bad at all. 7/10. Starter 2: Marinated Smoked Haddock, Potato & HorseradishMy starter was good, but Mrs. LF couldn't stop raving about hers \u00a0and this is not often something she does. She said that the dish was really amazing. The smoked fish was about the best I've had and everything on the plate was seasoned to perfection \u00a0the potato and horseradish were particularly good \u00a0and I wanted to keep coming back for more. At the end of it, I took some of the bread and mopped up the remaining bits. It was a well balanced, simple but nearly perfect dish, and that potato salad was to die for. 9/10. Main Course 1: Roast Loin of Middlewhite Pork, Bath Chap, Swede & KaleMy main of Middlewhite Pork was also good. The pork meat itself was tender and flavorful (but not overly so) and I really enjoyed the accompaniments of kale and mashed swede, whose colors of green and orange also lent the plate a nice visual appeal. The only real problem with the dish was that the layer of rind on the outside of the circular cut was simply too hard to eat. This was a shame, because I really love crackling when it's well done, but you felt you were in danger of breaking a tooth if you ate this stuff (of course, I managed to down a bit of it anyway). But the real eye opener was the Bath Chap, which was utterly delicious. It is quite fatty, so I was glad that there was only a thin slice of it, but the flavor was new to me and very appealingsort of liked cooked ham, but better than any I've had in the UK, with a nice hint of seasoning. 7/10. Main Course 2: Lemon Sole, Roast Jerusalem Artichoke & Mustard LeafUnfortunately, the good luck ran out for Mrs. LF at this point in the meal. She said that her main course of Lemon Sole was really average. I have had Lemon Sole in France and know what it can and should be like, and this didn't even touch the one that my mom makes. The sole was slightly overcooked, a bit dry and rather plain. Also, there wasn't much evidence of the sauce. The fish itself was fresh and it tasted healthy, but it wasn't delicious; it simply didn't taste as it should. The sole is a delicate fish and this one didn't melt in my mouth as it should have. 5/10. Wine: 2007 Bourgogne, Cuv\u00e9e Margot, Olivier LeflaiveOur chosen booze for the meal was a very quaffable entry-level red Burgundy from Olivier Leflaive. This is not the same as the more famous Domaine Leflaive (which, along with Lafon, is probably one of the few kings of burgundy to my",

Having made spinach soup at home many times, I wondered why I never thought to put snails in it -- but that is why you go out to eat -- to be surprised and inspired. The earthy flavours of the snails and spinach were excellent together. I'd seen a BBC programme about \"potted shrimp\" earlier in the week, so when I saw potted crab on the menu, I had to try it. I don't know how to put this, but it was the most crab-y tasting crab I have had in a very long time. The wine list was reasonably priced by London standards -- most wines under 40 quid and main dishes under 15.Gluten-free notes: Nearly all of the menu items are naturally gluten free and they were happy to advise.",

Perhaps the thing that made me biggest impression was the long wine list with selected varieties and manufacturers to supplement the perfect taste of the food. The interior is very cosy and the service is also flawless.",

I had the set lunch, 3-courses (starter, main and dessert) for 16.50 euros and my BF had the express lunch (main course, a glass of wine and a cup of coffee) for 9.50 euros. Not bad at all. It is a mid-price range establishment and is supposed to offer authentic British food, but I wouldn't know anything about British food because I'm not from there. Its layout is clean and simple with a mix of retro booth seating and table seating. Starter: I'm disappointed I did not take better notes on this dish but I do have a picture of it. It is some sort of hummus-like spread on toasts. Main dish, Fried smelt: This was my favorite dish. I believe its smelt but I'm not completely sure. It is a long skinny fish that is mildly fishy and oh-so pleasant to devour. I love small fishes like smelt and sardines. The dish is served with arugula, lemon and tartar sauce. Uncomplicated and delicious. Main dish, Fried dover sole: Served with a courgette (zucchini) salad and a lemon wedge. There's not much to say about this dish. It's as good as fried fish can get. Sole/flounder is a flat fish. It has a delicate but firm taste and is a medium fishy fish. I can't remember what dessert we had, I know it was a pudding of some sort. I do remember walking out full and satisfied. The food here looks underwhelming perhaps. It lacks presentation and appears so simple but don't be fooled by its appearance. Simplicity can be exquisite. This place is a great value and I highly recommend it.",

By the time the menus came, and by the time the food was served an hour and 20 minute had passed. I can't even remember what the food was like, I was so unhappy. Why didn't we leave? We were already there, it was getting late so other restaurants in the area would be full or closing for the night. We had already invested the time. Surely it couldn't take much longer (but it did). \u00a0OK, we thought maybe the restaurant was having a really off night. So, we reserved during the following year's visit ( May 2013), and once again the service failed us. Drastically. We won't be going back.",

Amazing traditional British food, walking distance from our place and solid service every single time.

Don't miss the sweetbreads and the livers, as well as the ox tail and the roe shoulder. Honestly, you could just randomize and whatever you picked would be perfect. Other notables are the buttermilk pudding, calf's brains, kidneys and the goose with quince cheese.Worth flying from San Francisco just to have dinner there!",

The food is traditional British and I mean traditional. The menu when I went included pig's face (brawn) and oysters fresh from Essex. Now, I love my oysters and appreciate they can be a bit hit or miss, but I didn't feel great about 30 minutes or so after my half dozen. Added to that my colleague (who I will admit is a slightly gluttonous individual) who was rather ill on his way home on the tube. I don't put this down to bad oysters actually, but rather the fact that he had a rather unwise combination of brawn, oysters (this was just to start), followed by lamb, rice pudding and a cheese plate. That combination washed down with 3 glasses of wine is enough to make anyone vomit. But enough of that, I had the aforementioned oysters to start and faggots for main. Beautifully cooked and tasty. I finished with a sorbet to cleanse my palate and to settle my stomach - it either worked or I have a stomach of iron (probably the latter).Anyways, don't let my colleague's experience put you off trying this delicious slice of British cuisine. Great food, great prices (more like gastro pub than restaurant) - just be a little wary of the oysters, definitely not for the faint hearted.",

The presentation of these dishes are superb. See attached pics. The leek was great, I usually do not eat leek so it was new to me. There was a minced up egg on it which was excellent. For my main, the mackerel to my surprise a whole entire mackerel came! Good value! But it was hard for me to eat because of the little bones. A bit dry but it also has a side salad which pairs well with it. I would probably order something different next time. The service times were great I was in and out in 40 minutes. \u00a0Treated myself to a latte too (\u00a32.95). Well made, sugar cubes at the side which is much more classier than bagged sugar. ;) All in all, it was great and I would definitely come again. I heard their menus change quite a bit.

    "text": "As it was the eve of my all-important day of birth, I had some high expectations from HR, even going so far as to request a \"nice table\" on my OpenTable reservation form when I booked it a couple weeks prior. We walked in to discover a table tucked away on a raised portion of the restaurant (just before a staircase that led into a booth-heavy area one level below). The booths looked roomier and comfier than our tight table. When I asked the waiter if we could move down there, he said, politely \"no, they're not available.\" (This is only worth mentioning because throughout the course of the evening, two of the booths were never touched/remained empty. We did end up discovering that our table was a pretty sweet spot because we could \"see\" nearly the entire restaurant from it. Not bad, but still.)My party of four ate very well (I'm uploading pics too). Whether it was fish, rabbit or something else, we all loved our meals. The only \"eh\" dish was the terrine. After St. John's and Arbutus' versions, I was disappointed in HR's terrine - just a bit bland and (worse) dry. But again, the rest of the meal - all of our meals - were quite divine.Our waiter (once he found out it was my bday eve) was a hoot and a holler and would often focus all of his attention to me w/ the just the right amount of sarcasm. I grew to love him, even after his refusal to give us the dang booth. He really won me over when he presented my apple cobbler with a candle in it. Cute! \u00a0... but he didn't sing.Anyway, very good food, great wine and snappy service. We had a fine time!",

    "text": "I had read that Hereford served traditional British food. As an American, this stereotype means fish and chips, Shepard's pie and a possibility of bland food. This however, was none of these things. Upscale and and minimal, \u00a0the menu was short and focused on game, fish and some, ah, other animal parts.We stuck with known meat items and were happy with the preparation of almost everything we ordered. We had salads and grilled asparagus to start. The asparagus was a particular highlight of the meal. I like asparagus quite a bit and this really pulled out every good flavor. The steak we had was also very good and came with a sauce, that, while enjoyed, we were not quite sure what it was. \u00a0My cousin's fish came full skeleton-in, along with a plate for once it was removed. This made the fish somewhat difficult to eat, though the taste was lovely. The service was also good. The only other issue we had was that while we came for lunch, one of the items we had initially planned on ordering was already out. Note to other Americans- they do have tap water but you need to specify this is what you want. Bottled water seems to be the norm here.",

The restaurant had just opened for the night and we were the only ones there for the first hour or so. \u00a0From the outside the restaurant looks quite small but they have converted the back and made it a very trendy space that seats many. I loved the decor, there was no music playing but I can imagine the restaurant getting quite romantic on busy weekends.I ordered the ox heart to start and the pork belly for mains. My husband ordered the lamb sweetbread and pork belly also. We paired these with a bottle of Malbec (French equivalent) which I was very happy with. The knowledgeable waiter recommended the wine for us.I was a little hesitant ordering the ox heart but I was surprisingly delighted by the choice I made. I thought they over did the salt but apart from that the food was absolutely gorgeous! The pork belly came with a HUGE crackling. This was the main reason we came here and it was delicious. I miss my pork crackling since we cant get it in the States.Definitely a place to try if you want to try modern British cuisine.",

    "text": "Returning to London 5 years after living there, I felt a bit lost on the food front. Everything I knew that was good may or may not still be good... indeed, they may or may not still be there. My friend and I wanted British food so St. John first came to mind. But there are also so many other options to try...! I'm really glad we gave Hereford Road a go. Tucked on a quiet street in Notting Hill, this place was warm and cozy, a bit of a high end gastropub. As we set out for traditional British food, we decided to go all out. We got the FRIED CALF BRAIN, LAMB'S SWEETBREADS, POTTED CRAB, and DEVILED LAMB KIDNEYS. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the lamb kidneys. Every aspect of the dish was flavorful, including the veggies and the potatoes. If I could do it over again, I would cut out the potted crab so I could eat more lamb kidneys. The crab was good but didn't stand out as much as the others.Make reservations early to avoid eating a 9:30 pm dinner. It's also not the easiest place to get to, the closest tube stop being Bayswater. But it is definitely a gem off the beaten path.",

    "text": "After learning that Tom Pemberton is a co-owner of Hereford Road (i love St John's) I had to try it during my last visit of London. We were initially skeptical because upon arrival at 18:30, the place was completely empty. We started off with a chilled red wine, Grignolino D'Asti. It was almost like a rose wine, without much of a scent. Refreshing nonetheless.The starter of Duck livers with green beans and tarragon was great. The tarragon added a hint of an anise flavor which was not too overpowering. For mains, we ordered the venison and pork belly pie (meant to serve 2). The waitress initially heard us incorrectly and thought we ordered two venison dishes. When that arrived, I think it looked really good but we did want what we initially ordered so we had it sent back. The manager was really courteous about everything. Since we had to wait an extra 25 minutes, they comped our appetizer which was a nice gesture.",
