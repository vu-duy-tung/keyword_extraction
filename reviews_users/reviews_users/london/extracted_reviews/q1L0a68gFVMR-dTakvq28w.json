    "text": "You will never have a bad night out at Tiroler Hut. It's like being in Eurovision and having some of the best cooked food at the same time. This isn't a Tirolean-themed restaurant; it is a Tirolean experience. The staff are the friendliest in London by a mile, purely because they love doing what they do, which is, night on night, entertain and delight their guests (customers). Although I've never managed it, it's a great place for celeb-spotting, as the walls are adorned with photos of Kate Moss, Hugh Grant and other famous residents of west London. The mood is always jovial, and it often does feel like your at a friend of a friend's house. The food is amazing- if you like meat. A meat platter is more than enough to satisfy even the largest of appetites and I've been told the fondue for 2, though highly alcoholic, is a great option for vegetarians. If you are going, it is advisable to ring to check they can seat you on the day if not before, as it is a tiny place. However, they will seat and feed you after midnight, which is quite a rarity in London. The entertainment has to be seen to be believed, but I won't spoil too much other than to say karaoke, cowbells and charisma.

You are better off going in a group but it is an absolutely brilliant night out. The restaurant is a 'typical' Austrian place where you get served German/Austrian beer in Stein Glases (equals 1 litre of beer, nearly 2 pints!). The food is also typical Austrian/German with dumplings etc - all tastes very nice and is served really quickly. There is entertainment throughout the evening and halfway through the owner starts singing Austrian country songs in a mixture of German and English - if you are lucky he also plays his cow bells. It is absolutely hilarious and the atmosphere is excellent.",

It's an Austrian bar/restaurant with a late licence. The food is mostly meat-based, so don't take your vegetarian friends, and is probably best enjoyed after you've downed a few Austrian beers. The highlight of the evening is the cowbell cabaret performed by the bar's lederhosen-clad owner Josef. He also entertains throughout the night, singing songs and accompanying himself on the accordion and electric organ. His repertoire ranges from The Sound of Music to Cher. Guests can join in if the mood takes them, but don't expect Josef to play the correct chords on the organ when you're singing your party-piece. I think I got up and sang The Lonely Goatherd once, but that memory is hazy",

I've been twice, both for birthdays, and both times everyone I've been with has had a lot of fun.It's kind of an odd concept but it works surprisingly well. You go down some steps to get into the restaurant which is quite small and a little clasutrophobic. The restaurant itself looks exactly like a chalet with some murals and things on the walls. The staff are all dressed in traditional heidi-esque clothes.The food is largely sausage platters and that sort of thing, and you buy beer in steins (?) which hold about two and a half pints. All this would be enough on its own, but where the Tiroler Hut really comes into its own is with the incredible entertainment. The last time I went was for my sister's birthday. My sister and another birthday person had a cow bell ringing contest which was followed by the incredible musical stylings of Ricardo (an elderly Chinese man who looks a little like a duck): uk.youtube.com/watch?v=a\u2026Incredible fun, particularly good for birthdays, though it is a little pricey.",

But watch out, this place is easy to miss as it is nestled away down a narrow staircase just off of busy Queensway. The decor of this restaurant is so awesome and lively from the second you step in at the bar, with red and white checkered table cloths and girls fully dressed in Bavarian beer outfits all around. Now don't come to this place thinking you are going to get a cheap meal. If you are coming for a main course, plan on spending a bit, especially if you are drinking as well. Splurge for the proper stine of beer and don't forget to try the house red Austrian wine with the monkey on the label. It is absolutely delish with the cheese founde. But let me tell you, the whole experience is well worth the money! With the Hungarian wine, cheese, and the Sound of Music Sing-a-long, I can't wait for the next time we all meet at the hut.",

Started out with a pint, then headed straight for the stein. I now feel prepared for the main event this week. My body is ready, maybe not my liver, but the rest is good to go, thanks to the bier that flows here.

    "text": "Tiroler Hut is good start to a night out, maybe better in a large group of people rather than for a date, as it tends to get noisy and a bit raucous. Then again, if your date likes that kind of thing Tiroler Hut does feel like an authentic Austrian restaurant; from the steins, to the decorations, to the fully kitted out waitrons. The food is pretty good too. Going in a large group, we opted for the party menu, which is quite good value for money. I had the bratwurst for starters and the wienerschnitzel for mains, which were both quite tasty, but nothing standout. The Apfelstrudel for dessert was quite decent as well, but not the best I've tried (that's reserved for some strudel I had from Innsbruck). I think where Tiroler Hut excels though, is the atmosphere. Between Joseph playing his accordion , singing contemporary hits (as well as his cowbells), the patrons being encouraged to sing along and the excellent and friendly service, you have the makings of a very fun night. On the night we went, it was apparently Josephs birthday (maybe every night is Josephs birthday? Maybe not.), so there were complimentary schnapps all around, at one particularly surreal moment, a good friend of Joseph and the restaurant gave us his very enthusiastic rendition of Queens Bohemian Rhapsody. This was 3 steins in, so perhaps it wasn't that surreal. Tiroler Hut has many fans, as evidenced by the various celebrity photographs they've got on various walls (Kate Moss has even made it onto the front page of their website), so I'm not alone in liking this place. Highly recommended. Pros- excellent atmosphere- authentic steins (1 litre)- authentic fare- live and interesting music- unique experience- excellent service Cons- food is not as amazing as you might expect from such a well reputed restaurant.- gets very busy (but contributes to atmosphere), so book in advance-not very vegetarian friendly",

Yeah, this place is Austrian themed, but presumably executed by a bored housewife that was a bit too inspired by reruns of TLC decorating shows. It's like Austria threw up all over the walls. We go to the bar and get giant steins, of what type of beer I can't recall. We quickly tire of the bar as it's obvious all of the action is in the other room. We sat at a table, which didn't make the server happy - it would take us a while to work through those steins we payed for at the bar. What's that you say? Oompah band karaoke night? A boisterous, international crowd singing songs old and new? An Italian man of Asian descent singing German pop? How's THAT for a melting pot of cultures? We clang our beers, we dance with strangers, we have a blast!Up until now I was going to give this place a 4 star review. Then I remembered that the DJ played a medley of Boney M's greatest hits. That, my little Austrian friend, just earned you a 5th star.",

It is a busy place, and I wanted to eat there before and could not get a table. But finally I managed to get in and it was a pleasure. I do not know why, \u00a0but everybody, guests and staff alike, seemed to be smiling and happy. For all I can tell, the nice little restaurant Tiroler Hut simply sports a great vibe. Most servers also speak German, so if you would like to buy your schnitzel in German, you can even do that. Starting with some bread and butter, my meal began rather average. Unfortunately, I was not in a wine mood that evening, but the wine list read quite promising. I will definitely get an Austrian white the next time I go there. For the main, I went off menu. I asked for a Wiener Schnitzel with spaetzle - you could probably describe it as a special kind of pasta - and gravy. When I ordered, I was a bit disappointed that they only serve pork an no veal. Anyway, it was worth going off menu. My main was really delicious. A good escalope, a delicate gravy and tasty spaetzle. You could argue that the spaetzle were a bit small, but I won't. They were good. That's it.Of course I could not skip the dessert. Continuing with the Austrian theme, I went for the Apfelstrudel. And what should I say, it was heavenly. Altogether, I had very good food and just a great time at Tiroler Hut. No doubt, I will come back. So far, this is probably the best German or Austrian restaurant I know in London.",

It was like I had been transported into a dream world and there was no escape.This is not German, it's Austrian, and it's pretty damn authentic too. I can't say enough good things about this place, I want to live here and bask in the glow of happiness it brings.

Our first steps in we were greeted by a costumed waitress who sat us at a community table. A man behind the music booth was ringing his cowbells while the entire restaurant sang along to Edelweiss. We quickly stepped in line with our own huge hefeweizens and cheese fondue. The rest of the night was filled with many more libations and lots of singing. My favorite moment was the full out Bohemian Rapsody sung by every single person in the place! Classic.This is a \"when in Rome\" moment people! Don't be the Ebenezer in the corner refusing to sing.

Maybe. It was hot and filling and tasty if you like your cheese runny and your bread in small cubes (which I do, by the way).What has stuck with me is the decor. PIne panelling, faux, shuttered windows looking out to a glossy poster depicting scenes of Alpine bovine bliss.There are red and white checkered vinyl table cloths and beer tankards and a huge man in lederhosen playing tunes on an accordion that reflect your nationality and accompany your meal like a crisp glass of Liebfraumilch. It's how I like to imagine the lifestyle of Arnold Schwarzenegger's family back home in the old country.Busty, dirndl-clad waitresses smile as they bring your order to the table and let there be a whiff of it being your birthday in the air then joy of joys you may take in hand the smallest bell for the live cowbell-rung rendition of Edelweiss.It was my birthday every Thursday for about 3 months at one point. It's takes a bit of an effort to locate and then get down the stairs but when you're in you're in and you feel like you've discovered some long-lost forgotten secret of a place and feel very proud of yourself indeed.",

All chalet wood, and cow bells, and chintz. We ordered fondue, of course. And sauerkraut. And meaty wurst type things. It was all amazing. We dipped everything on the table in the cheese, and sauerkraut was the best. Then the owner stepped behind the DJ booth (?) with an accordion and proceeded to lead us all in a sing along of Sound of Music tracks, yodelling and he played the sax too. Dinner and a show, bam!It's a bit expensive, but fondue always is. Totally worth a visit, go with friends, family, but not someone who takes themselves too seriously. It's cheese, you were warned.",

The low ceilings, dark wood of the interior and the traditional outfits worn by the wait staff made me feel I was in Austria.So I figure Austrian food isn't know for being super vegetarian friendly, but this restaurant does it's best to accomodate. Some of the starters included Tomato and Mozzarella Salad, Avocado Vinaigrette and Gebackene Pilze (fried mushrooms in breadcrumbs). For mains there was Fusilli and Cheese Fondue. I'm not sure if that's a good representation of Austrian food, but I'll forgive.But food was only secondary to the experience (but I'm sure my meat eating companions begged to differ) - our waiter was funny, attentive and made us all smile and laugh. Then there's the music, which is mainly played in a small little booth in the main dining room. First there was a guy playing the keyboard for a bit, and then another guy came out to play the accordion for a few songs. Then he switched from accordion to clarinet. It was quite the treat, and it had folks swaying side to side in unison with the music.It's definitely the kind of place you'd want to go with a group of people to share in the food, fun and atmosphere (and of course, the beer too!).",

    "text": "When the dinner here was planned, i was positively unable to figure out where the place was. I had been to Westbourne Grove many many times. How do i not know of this restaurant ? It was a similar story when i actually arrived. It took me some time to find the narrow stairway that lead from the side-walk to the dining area at the basement.There is a small bar and a couple of rooms down there. The Austro-Hungarian owners have been operating it since 1967. The food is very very good. I have been unable to find good German food in London and i have always had a liking for the cuisine since the time i lived in Germany.For starters i ordered a selection of sausages. They were served cut in small pieces and were delicious. There was also a black pudding sausage piece in there. I didn't know that the Germans also like this \"bloody\" preparation. I also tried a bit of fondue from my friend. It was nice but probably not as good as the one i had in Switzerland last month.I had pork schnitzels with noodles (remember sound of music ... my favourite things ?). The schnitzel was different from what i remembered from so many years ago ... but thats probably just got to do with my bad memory. The meat was outstanding. The noodles were tasteless ... but they are not supposed to be had on their own anyway. It was a meat feast on the table ... from goulash to huge brackwursts to frankfurters split on the top used as decoration on a dish ... it was a remarkable sight to behold :)I washed it all down with a small weisbier (where small in german means 500ml). Others went for the full 1 litre Oktoberfest style jugs.Towards the end of dinner the owner (Joseph) came and sang for the customers .... and guess which were the only ones i recognised ? Sound of Music of course. He is a wonderful guy and talked with all of us. This wasn't a place where i was expecting live music ... so it was an added positive.The only drawback of Tiroler's Hut is that the prices are steep. The starters are between \u00a36-\u00a38 and the main courses cost ~\u00a315. Its very easy to get your bill up to \u00a330 per person. But that won't prevent me from coming here with my friends again ... its a wonderful place to celebrate ... anything :)",

But for one fateful night in London during our honeymoon the planets aligned and myself and my bride decided to stop in to Tiroler Hut for a drink and some strudel and for the next two hours, we were Austrian.I am not sure that I am able to convey in words the magical experience we had at the Tiroler. You walk in the door, down the stairs and you are transported across borders and as far you are concerned, you are sitting in a tavern in Austria. From the friendly staff to the amazing food and the tasty schnapps the place in excellent.But what truly put it over the top is the Tiroler Huts owner and its patrons. While waiting for our strudel a gentleman started playing piano and singing some folk-songs. That was great in its own right but then, Joseph - the owner of the establishment - ever joyful with a friendly smile and a twinkle in his eye starts assembling a clarinet. There was only one other couple at the place at the time but he proceeds to give us a private concert of songs from the \"old country\".That would have been magical enough, but then 4 men, dressed in lederhosen and traditional German hunting jackets walk in and sit down. The next thing I know, we are all friends, laughing talking and singing. Its as if Joseph, the piano player, these gentlemen in lederhosen and we could have all been lifelong friends.Joseph, learning that we were newlysweds serenaded us with two songs that we danced to between the tables and then he treated us to his INCREDIBLE cowbells. I know how that sounds initially but it is hands down one of the most impressive things I have ever seen, especially up close and personal. From an old folktune to \"Eidleweiss\" to \"Do a Deer\" he rang them out beautifully while we all sang along.Great food, great drinks, great ambiance and something that you dont find at most places, Great Friends. Tiroler Hut Restaurant has it all and has now become a cornerstone in ANY future visit to London. We will be back. And maybe next time, we will pack our own lederhosen for the occasion!",

The place is easy to miss if you're not actively looking for it, a small entrance and a flight of stairs down and you're bang in the middle of a very traditional dining area. You will be greeted by very polite and friendly staff dressed in traditional clothes; I couldn't fault the service here, it's attentive and full of smiles. The tables for two people are really small, to the point that I could not keep my mobile phone on the table with the bread basket, bottle of wine and two starter plates as there simply wasn't space. I think nowadays it's a bit cheeky to charge for bread and butter (especially when the bread isn't that great) but whatever, 1.50 per person isn't really going to break the bank. 25 quid for a bottle of mediocre, watery house wine, though, is another matter entirely. I'd expect to pay \u00a315 for that sort of thing, tops. I kind of regretted not having stuck to beer, but beer fills one up and I was there to stuff my pretty face with pig and carbs. Plus, as far as I have seen, they only have ONE loo. In a place that sells a lot of beer? I can only imagine there would be queues to pee later on, not my idea of fun.The food arrived promptly; my starter of mixed sausage plate was easily the best thing of the night, even though presentation wasn't espectacular the sausages were tasty and plentiful. My friend got the pickled hering and he liked it, but I had a taste and found it flavourless. Had better pickled fish at Ikea restaurant. For mains I had pork with mushroom sauce and egg dumplings, and not a single thing on my plate stood out. I found the dumplings too stodgy (and that coming from a carb lover) and lacking flavour and the meat/sauce were bland. I didn't try my friend's main (randon bits of pork, I didn't get the name), partly because I was put off by the way the dish was presented and mostly because after two forkfuls of my own food I had no space left for anything else. The roast potatoes were good.The entertainment is ok, but as the place is only small it can be quite loud; especially if you're near the music source. And I believe it gets tiresome pretty quickly after a while (we arrived and left early). They were lacking energy, maybe it was our bad luck or everyone was tired of singing/playing the same stuff every night. I wouldn't blame them.With service we paid \u00a350 per person. Not a fortune but really for the price and hype I certainly expected more. But it was nice to check it out myself, so give it a go anyway; lots of people seem to love it and maybe it's your kettle of (pickled) fish. :)",

    "text": "For those of you who enjoy a German beer hall or octoberfest, this is the awesome Austrian version. This place serves beer I steins (\u00a310 a pop), good hearty cuisine, I had the trout while my table mates hate wienershnitzels, and even delivered a decent Apple schnapps. Left here with a good buzz going. But what really rocks this place is the love band. They bring a great mix of octoberfest sing along songs along with the sound of music soundtrack. Then the bell show occurs. What an event. A man comes out and plays a few tunes using a range of bells. Highly entertaining. Sing along gets rowdy by the time the third stein hits the table. Overall a fun night, especially if you don't make it to Germany in October.",

You have to know where you're going to find this place, it has a small entrance and it goes straight to a basement, but the food was incredible, the quality was like no other! You have to try everything, it's all delicious. Huge compliments for their wine list, we tried 3 different bottles (2 Austrian, 1 French) and they were all smooth and full of flavour.Big Hugs and kisses to the cow bell ringer who asked me to help him play Edelweiss. ;)",

My wife and I started off with the bread and butter. \u00a0The bread basket wasn't fantastic, but the main course was so good, I'm not docking it any stars. \u00a0We had the chicken schnitzel & stuffed cabbage rolls. \u00a0The portions are good and we could have each eaten two plates!! Best German food we've ever had! The restaurant is small and we were one of the first ones in the restaurant for the day and as a result we had the pleasure of being serenaded by the accordion player who played a low-key playlist and personable as can be. Highly recommended!!",

I might have been lucky showing up there on a Friday at about 9:30 and able to find a table for two. When we called ahead to reserve they said to just show up cause it's easier to find tables for two since its group heavy mostly in here.It can be a tight squeeze. Low ceilings and close tables.

    "text": "New Years Eve at the Tiroler Hut is determinately the best NYE I have ever had. I wasn't expecting much as many of the London restaurants have done a fine job of letting my husband and I down but the Tiroler Hut exceeded all expectations. On top of it, they did not allow anyone in the restaurant without a reservation. This kept the tiny restaurant open for people to dance and move around. Our table reservation was set for 8:30 and by reservation, I mean that was our table for the entire evening. The menu was set and while it wasn't sausages and potatoes as we had hoped, the food was good and was very filling. We will definitely return to try their standard menu. The service was great. The entertainment was even greater. My husband and I thought that we would eat dinner and leave about 10pm but the staff served the courses so slowly, we had only had our starter by 10pm. Usually I would bock at slow service but it was nice because there was so much food and the staff wanted you to stay, \"get drunk slowly\" and take in all the crazy entertainment. The restaurant is in a basement and the ceilings are extremely low. Anyone who has issues with small places will have a difficult time here. I felt like I was back at Oktoberfest with all the clanking of the glasses and sing alongs. I'd describe the entertainment as half lounge singing half karaoke. The lounge singer has been working at Tiroler Hut for over 50 years and then the karaoke singers that would take over while the lounge singer was on break seemed to be regulars. Like the \"Ricardo\" who was of Asian decent but claimed he was Italian and sang American songs.The crowd is mixed - young, old, and all of different cultures. The sing alongs to American songs and the Sound of Music soundtrack may seem corny to anyone who has not been to a true German bier garten or Oktoberfest but this is really how it is at Oktoberfest.My only regret is that I did not come dressed in a dirndl. It seemed as though half of the crowd was dressed in traditional German attire and I was jealous of them!The restaurant is kind of divided into two halves. The bar, small dining room, and toilets are on one half (the half you enter after coming down the stairs) and the other half is the main dining room. You will want to sit in the main dining room as this is where all the action takes place.Oh, and the coat check is free!",

The food is amazing and has a few typical austrian delicacies on the menu. Dont be fooled by the slightly offputting stairs at the entrance or the low ceiling. One of our party has trouble with stairs and another is very tall. His head touched the ceiling so right from the start the staff and all of us were having a laugh and everyone had a really good night. We really enjoyed the live music as well as the waiters entertaining us. One girl was kind enough to translate a phrase for us :-) :-) It was an amazing night all round and we couldnt have asked for a better send off :-)",
